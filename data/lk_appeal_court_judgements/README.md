An appeals court judgment (also called an appellate court judgment) is a ruling delivered by a higher court that reviews decisions made by lower courts. It ensures that justice is applied consistently, correcting legal or procedural errors that may have occurred at trial.

In Sri Lanka, the Court of Appeal plays this role, shaping how laws are interpreted and setting important legal precedents that influence future cases. These judgments are central to upholding fairness, protecting rights, and strengthening the rule of law.
