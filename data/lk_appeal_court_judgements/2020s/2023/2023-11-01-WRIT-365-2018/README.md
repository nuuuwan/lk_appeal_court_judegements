The petitioner through this application seeks relief by way of Writ of Certiorari

and Writ of Mandamus. The petitioner challenges the failure and/or inaction

of the 1st 14th respondents regarding the illegal and unauthorized

construction of a Kovil on a state land situated next to the land of the

petitioner. The petitioner claims that none of the aforementioned respondents

have taken any legal steps against the 16th respondent for the gross violation

of laws and regulations.

6

CA-WRT-365-18 Page 6 of 13 01/11/2023 IJ-32-23

The salient facts of the case are as follows. Petitioner states around 2004, the

16th respondent without any valid legal permission commenced a

praying/worship place at the small plot of land next to the land of the

petitioner. The 16th respondent had kept a pole in the land yet had not

reserved the place formally. The petitioner claims that few Hindu worshippers

visited the said place. The petitioner further states that later in 2004 the 16th

respondent illegally commenced to build a metal fence and reserved a plot of

land for the said place of worship. The petitioner states that while the 16th

respondent was building the metal fence it damaged and destroyed adjoining

lands (P4 -P14) including the petitioners. Thereafter, the activities of the said

place increased and the petitioner claims the activities caused a nuisance to

the neighborhood. Due to the said nuisance people in the area had made

complaints (P15) to a number of authorities including the 1st, 7th and 8th

respondents, yet claims no actions had been taken against the act of the 16th

respondents. By the beginning of 2017, the 16th respondent had placed a

statue of God in the place where the pole was already erected, thereafter

activities such as pujas, music, processions and chantings by loudspeakers

rapidly increased and the unauthorized construction accelerated further.

Several parties submitted their objections to relevant authorities including

the 1st 14th respondents with regards to the said unlawful construction.

Moreover, the Governors office of the Central Province and the Headquarters

Inspector of the Nuwara Eliya Police too made complaints (P21) to the 11th

respondents with this regard. Later on, 07.03.2017 an unauthorized

announcement (P22) was issued by the 11th respondent who was the

Municipal Commissioner at the given time. However, due to the undue

political influence the 11th respondent himself overturned his decision and

issued a letter (P23) dated 28.06.2017 to the Divisional Secretary stating that

the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council is not objecting to the existence of the

alleged Kovil named Katpagavinayagar Kovil and future development

activities must be limited to 10 X 15 sq.ft of the land. By the end of 2017

the 16th respondent built a small altar, erected a metal roof joining concrete

7

CA-WRT-365-18 Page 7 of 13 01/11/2023 IJ-32-23

slabs and beams and the flooring was made of cement bricks (P16 P20).

When the activities were in progress the residents and others including the

petitioner continuously complained to the respondents. On 19.12.2017 the

5th respondent (Deputy Director [Planning] of the Regional Office in Nuwara

Eliya of Urban Development Authority) issued a letter (P27) to the 16th

respondent strictly informing to immediately stop all the activities of the

unauthorized construction. Through the letter (P28) dated 22.12.2017 the

13th respondent informed the Coordinating Secretary of the Chief Minister of

the Central Province the illegality of the said unauthorized construction.

Moreover, on 25.01.2018 the 12th respondent sent a letter (P29) to the

Headquarters Police of Nuwara Eliya emphasizing the 16th respondent was

maintaining an illegal construction on a land owned by the 7th respondent.

On 11.01.2018 the 16th respondent had sent a letter of request to the 12th

respondent requesting to issue a license for the land where he was

maintaining the unauthorized construction yet through the letter (P30) dated

16.02.2018 the 12th respondent had rejected the request. During the time

period February May 2018 the 16th respondent did not engage in any

constructions yet the nuisance activities had continued. And a peoples

gathering called Voice of Nuwara Eliya sent a letter (P31) of complaint to the

District Secretary, Divisional Secretary and SSP Nuwara Eliya. By the 1st week

of May 2018, the paused unauthorized works of the 16th respondent

commenced again disregarding all warnings issued against him. The

petitioner and other people had submitted their complaints (P32 and P33) to

1st 14th respondents, yet the petitioner claims none of them had taken any

appropriate actions. Again on 24.05.2018 the 12th respondent issued an

unauthorized announcement (P34) against the 16th respondent but he

disregarded it and continued the activities as he desired. Therefore, the

petitioner and others complained to the president and police. Furthermore,

the petitioner sent letters of demand to the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 8th, 9th and 10th

respondents yet thus far no action has been taken.

8

CA-WRT-365-18 Page 8 of 13 01/11/2023 IJ-32-23

Thereby the petitioner through this instant application seeks relief by way of

Writ of Certiorari quashing the reserve of an extent of land to be developed for

the development activities of the Kovil without a formal approval of a plan, a

Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st 5th respondents to take measures under

S28(A) of the Urban Development Law No. 41 of 1978 amended by Act No. 04

of 1982 with respect to the construction of the 16th respondent and a Writ of

Mandamus directing 7th 10th respondents under the provisions of S28(A) Of

the Urban Development Law No. 41 of 1978 as amended by Act No. 04 of 1982

and/or S42(A) of the Municipal Council Ordinance No. 29 of 1947 in respect

of the construction of the 16th Respondent.

When considering the petition of the petitioner it is noticeable that the prayer

of the petitioner is weak in its status. At the outset of the matter itself it could

be said that the relief requested by the petitioner in this instant application

cannot be granted, and even if the relief is granted the concern over the

existence and validity of R4 marked by 1-5th respondents, the development

permit dated 30.10.2018 should be examined. Nevertheless, this court cannot

annul the said development permit (R4 sometimes referred to as R6 by the 16th

respondent) as the petitioner in this instant application has not mentioned

nor challenged proceedings with regards to R4.

According to the letter issued by the 11th respondent dated 28.06.2017 to the

Divisional Secretary it was stated that the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council is

not objecting to the existence of the alleged Kovil named Katpagavinayagar

Kovil and future development activities must be limited to 10 X 15 sq.ft of

the land. Furthermore, through the R4 development permit it was legally

permitted for the said area to be used for the purpose of religious development

subject to few conditions and restrictions.

It must also be noted that the commissioner of the Municipal Council prior to

the issuing of development permits for religious matters and developments

considers peoples welfare, concerns and the relates of the residents of the

area. This is to ensure that the sensitivity of the community and the welfare

9

CA-WRT-365-18 Page 9 of 13 01/11/2023 IJ-32-23

of all residents are provided for, while maintaining the harmony between

people and ethnic groups.

Consideration should also be given to whether the government made any

alterations to the policies set out by them within the course of the said

development. It is essential to ensure that changes in government policies do

not impact the sensitivity and harmony of people in the community.

According to S28(A) of the Urban Development Law No. 41 of 1978 as

amended by Act No. 04 of 1982 the respondents have the power and authority

to take necessary steps/actions in respect of unauthorized constructions.

S28(A) reads as follows:

(1) Where in a development area, any development activity is commenced

continued, resumed or completed without permit or contrary to any term or

condition set out in a permit issued in respect of such development activity, the

Authority may, in addition to any other remedy available to the Authority under

this Law, by written notice require the person who is executing or has executed

such development activity, or has caused it to be executed, on or before such day

as shall be specified in such notice, not being less than seven days from the date

thereof

(a) to cease such development activity forthwith; or

(b) to restore the land on which such development activity is being

executed or has been executed, to its original condition; or

(c) to secure compliance with the permit under the authority of which

that development activity is carried out or engaged in, or with any term

or condition of such permit, and for the purposes of compliance with the

requirements aforesaid

(2) It shall be the duty of the person on whom a notice is issued under

subsection (1) (2) It shall be the duty of the person on whom a notice is issued

under subsection (1) to comply with any requirement specified in such notice

10

CA-WRT-365-18 Page 10 of 13 01/11/2023 IJ-32-23

within the time specified in such notice or within, such extended time as may

be granted by the Authority on application made in that behalf.

(3)

(a) Where in pursuance of a notice issued under subsection (1), any building

or work is not demolished or altered within the time specified in the

notices or within such extended time as may have been granted by the

Authority, the Authority may apply to the Magistrate to make a

mandatory order authorizing the Authority to demolish or alter the

building or work, and the Magistrate on serving notice on the person who

had failed to comply with the requirement of the Authority under

Subsection (1) to demolish or alter the building or work, may, if he is

satisfied to the same effect, make order accordingly.

(b) If such person undertakes to demolish or alter the building or work, the

Magistrate may if he thinks fit postpone the operation of the order for

such time not exceeding two months as he thinks sufficient for the

purpose of giving the person an opportunity of demolishing or altering

the building or work.

(4) Where a mandatory order has been made under subsection (3), it shall be

the duty of the police authorities to render all necessary assistance to the

Authority in carrying out the order.

Accordingly, the respondents are vested with the power to take necessary

actions against the 16th respondent only if the development activity has been

done without a valid permit, which will then become an unauthorized

construction activity. Nevertheless, in the instant application the document

marked R4 demonstrates that the building plan for the said construction has

been approved by the 7th respondent. Thus, once a construction activity is

carried out with an approved building plan, the said construction would not

be considered to be in violation of the provisions of the Urban Development

11

CA-WRT-365-18 Page 11 of 13 01/11/2023 IJ-32-23

Law and therefore the respondents cannot be empowered to take actions

against the construction activities and the relevant parties.

It is quite clear through both the oral and written submissions made by the

petitioner that this application is mainly filed based on the fact that the said

construction has been made without proper approval and falls within the

category of unauthorized construction and thus the respondents are duty

bound by the provisions of S28(A) of the Urban Development Law. However,

with the filing of objections of the respondents and the filed document marked

R4 it could be deemed that petitioner has misconceived in law and the

construction no longer attracts the provisions of S28(A) of the Urban

Development Act, since it is an approved construction.

On the other hand, it must be mentioned that if the 1st 5th and 7th 10th

respondents are to take action against the 16th respondent in terms of S28(A)

of the Urban Development Law, in respect of the said construction which has

a valid permit, such actions of the respondents would amount to an act of

ultra vires. Furthermore, in such an instance where the said construction of

the 16th respondents is built upon a valid permit issued by an appropriate

authority, this court too is barred from intervening.

The Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) during his submissions mentioned that

the petitioner does not challenge any procedural status of any action or order

by the respondents and thereby claimed that seeking a relief through Writ

jurisdiction was improper. Further the DSG stated that only if the petitioner

challenged such order or proceeding this court has the discretion to intervene.

This court deems this submission of the DSG correct.

In the case of R V Fly (Bishop) 1750 1 Wro B 152: Chief Justice Lee stated

that the court never grants a mandamus, except it indisputably sees that

there is power lodged in the person to whom the mandamus is prayed.

Furthermore, the case of Borella Private Hospital v Bandaranayake and

Two Others CA/1006/2000 (Writ) CA Minutes 21-11-2004, it has been held

12

CA-WRT-365-18 Page 12 of 13 01/11/2023 IJ-32-23

that: In an application for Mandamus, where the petitioner alleges a statutory

functionary as having acted without jurisdiction and/or authority, the

petitioner is obliged to disclose the statutory provision that has been

violated that establishes a legal right in the petitioner and a

corresponding legal duty on the statutory functionary (Emphasis

added).

The principle enunciated by Halsbury (pg722, para 1308) also emphasizes

another reason why mandamus should not be granted in the present case. As

per Halsbury it states: A Mandamus will not go when it appears that it would

be futile in its result, accordingly, the court will not, by mandamus order

something which is impossible of performance because the party against whom

mandamus is prayed does not, for some reason possess the power to obey.

Thus, in the instant application the 1st 14th respondents do not have the

power to initiate legal proceedings to demolish the construction which has an

approved building plan. Thereby the submission of the DSG where he stated

no Writ of Mandamus will lie against the respondents can be deemed correct.

Furthermore, the petitioner through his petition also prays for a Writ of

Certiorari quashing the reserve of an extent of land to be deployed for the

development activities of the Kovil without a formal approval of plan. However,

the petitioner nowhere in his petition challenges the development permit

granted. Even after the 7th respondent issued the approval of the building

plan for the construction, the petitioner has not amended his petitioner nor

has he challenged the said approval. Without challenging the development

permit or its proceedings granted by the relevant authority, the petitioner

prayer for a Writ of Certiorari quashing the reserve of extent of land deployed

for the development activities of the kovil becomes misconceived in law.

Nevertheless, the petitioner through the petition claimed that the

unauthorized construction such as pujas, processions, chanting by

loudspeakers, shouting, sounds, music are performed throughout day and

night. Its a large nuisance to the neighbors including the petitioner. And

13

CA-WRT-365-18 Page 13 of 13 01/11/2023 IJ-32-23

further during the oral submissions the counsel for petitioner reiterated on

the disturbance caused to the neighbors due to the constructed kovil and its

proceedings. However, the counsel for the respondent firmly noted and

emphasized on the fact that the counsel for the petitioner in his oral

submissions used the term Public Nuisance repeatedly to explain the

disturbance caused by the acts of the 16th respondent. And thereby stated

that in an event of Public Nuisance Section 261 of the Penal Code identifies

and carries separate remedies and legal consequences. And as per Section 98

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, an application seeking relief under the

offence of public nuisance could be made to the Magistrates Court. Hence,

claimed that the petitioner must go before an appropriate forum in order to

obtain proper relief for the matter of concern.

This Court also notes that documents submitted by the petitioner of the

instant application is vague in its nature, nevertheless it could be

acknowledged that the document marked R4 marked (by 1-5th respondents)

issued by the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council was issued prima facie

according to the procedure laid down in the statute. However, if the petitioner

believes otherwise, he may possibly have challenged the document at an

appropriate forum.

Thereby this Court is of the view that the prayer of the petitioner seeking relief

through Writ cannot be granted.

Application dismissed without costs.
