Wood Papers Ltd10 the exposition of principle of interpretation about exemption from tax the passage runs thus: Literally exemption is freedom from Liability, tax or duty. Fiscally it may assume varying shapes, especially in a growing economy. For instance, tax holding to new units, concessional rate of tax to goods or persons for limited period or with specific objective etc. That is why its construction, unlike charging provision, is like an exception and on normal principle of construction or interpretation of statutes, it is construed strictly either because of legislative intention or on economic justification of inequitable burden or progressive approach of fiscal provisions intended to augment State revenue.11",

The Appellants argument was that since Section 11, by which amendments were made to Section 21 E, is not included in Section 61 (5) (a) of the (Amendment) Act No. 12 of 2004, said amendments cannot be given retrospective effect. The Appellant argued that by the time amendments made to Section 21 E came into operation on 18th November 2004, the day of certification of the amendment, the Appellant had already completed the acquisition of KVC Ltd, prior to 31st March 2004. Although the Appellant has submitted as above in respect of both years of assessment, it is clear that this argument can only be valid for the year of assessment 2004/2005 and not for the year of assessment 2005/2006.",

Further, a new scenario was added having ownership as above with management rights.

It is normally defined in terms of three fundamental rights which are, the right to possess an asset and/or its financial value, the right to exercise the influence over the use of the asset, and the right to information about the status of the assets20. Other rights are to transfer assets and to receive an income or return from them. The traditional concept of property involves two aspects: the right to determine the use of the assets and the right to benefit from its use. When the two aspects of property are dissociated, it is possible to distinguish nominal ownership which is the right to receive revenue as a return for risking ones wealth by investing in the company, from effective ownership, which is the ability to control the corporate assets21.",

The Court will interfere if the finding has been reached without any evidence or upon a view of facts which could not be reasonably entertained.

Yet, all that Section 21 E provides is that the rehabilitation of the enterprise has to be done subject to the terms approved by the Ministry and not that the Ministry of Finance has to decide on the availability of the income tax exemption. Therefore, in my view, the Ministry of Finance may have confirmed that the rehabilitation has been done according to the approved terms enabling the party being entitled to claim the exemption but, the decision on the entitlement under the IR Act is a matter to be decided by the Inland Revenue Department.",
