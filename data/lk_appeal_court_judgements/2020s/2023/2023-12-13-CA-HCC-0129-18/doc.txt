Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the appellant) being aggrieved of the conviction and the sentence of him by the

learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Kurunegala for causing the

death of one Munasinghe Arachchilage Indunil Chamara on 09-11-2001 at a

place called Uyangalla, Nikadalupotha, and thereby committing the offence of

murder punishable in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, the appellant was found guilty as charged of the

judgement dated 03-04-2018 by the learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala,

and the appellant was sentenced to death accordingly.

Page 3 of 9

The facts that led to the indictment against the appellant can be summarized as

follows.

Facts in Brief

The deceased Indunil Chamara was the appellants elder sisters son. He was

around 9 years old at that time and was living with the appellant while attending

school.

On the day of the incident, namely, 09-11-2001, PW-04 who was a neighbour

living on the land next to the appellants house was working in his garden. The

deceased was well known to him as he used to attend the same school with his

two children, and used to come to his house often to study with his children.

The witness has first observed the appellant assaulting the victim child, initially,

using his bare hands, urging him to study. The child has started to cry as a

result, and the appellant has then taken a club and had started to assault the

child all over his body. Being unable to observe what was happening any longer,

the witness has called another person who was a close relative of the appellant

to come and witness what was happening. Although he wanted to intervene and

attempt to rescue the child, both of them have decided against it and had left.

Subsequently, he has heard that the child has succumbed to the injuries

received as a result of the assault. He has stated that he observed the assault

from a distance about 40 45 meters.

In cross-examination of the witness, the appellant has not taken up any

particular defence, but has questioned the witness as to the place where he gave

the statement to the police, and about an alleged contradiction as to the time

where he saw this incident. The said contradiction has been marked as V-1. In

his evidence, he has stated that he observed this incident around 12.30 in the

afternoon. However, in his statement to the police, he has stated that he came

home around 2.30 in the afternoon.

Page 4 of 9

The only suggestion made to the witness has been that due to a previous enmity

he had with the appellant, he has made a false statement to the police, which

the witness has denied. The other eyewitness called on behalf of the prosecution

had been PW-06 Roseline Nona. She is also a neighbour of the appellant. After

hearing a loud voice from the direction of the appellants house, she has come

out of her house and looked at that direction. She has seen the deceased child

being dragged by the appellant while assaulting him. As a result, the child has

fallen on the ground. The appellant has dragged him again, and while being

dragged, she has observed the deceased childs head being struck on the wall

nearby. She has seen this incident around 2.00 in the afternoon. Subsequently,

she has heard that the child died at the hospital.

The police officer who conducted the investigations as to the incident has given

evidence at the trial, and he has observed that from the places where the

witnesses have claimed that they saw the incident, it was possible for them to

observe what was happening in the land of the appellant.

The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who conducted the postmortem of the

deceased child has produced his Post-Mortem Report marked as P-01. The JMO

has observed 18 visible injuries on the body of the child, most of them being

contusions. In injury number 08, he has observed a fracture of the collarbone of

the child and corresponding lacerations in the lungs. The injury number 10 had

been to the head and the JMO has opined that the death has resulted due to the

blunt trauma caused to the head. He has opined that the injury to the head was

an injury that was essentially fatal. He has observed that most of the injuries

can be caused due to an assault by a club or a similar instrument.

When the appellant was required to take up his defence at the conclusion of the

prosecution case, he has made a statement from the dock. He has stated that

when he came home, the deceased was not at home and had gone for a bath, he

came home after about one and a half hours later, and fell on the ground

unconscious. Thereafter, he took steps to take the child to the hospital. He has

Page 5 of 9

neither denied nor challenged the evidence of the witnesses that he is the person

who caused the injuries to the deceased child.

The learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala after considering the essential

ingredients of culpable homicide in terms of section 293 of the Penal Code, has

considered the evidence placed before the Court and had come to a firm finding

that the evidence establishes the fact that it was the appellant who caused the

injuries that resulted in the death of the child. The learned High Court Judge

has found no basis for the defence taken up by the appellant in his dock

statement. The learned High Court Judge has also determined that the appellant

has failed to provide a sufficient explanation as to the strong and incriminating

evidence against him that came to light during the trial. It has been determined

that the appellant has caused injuries to the child with the intention of causing

his death, and accordingly he has been convicted for the offence of murder.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of his appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant, although she

has taken several grounds of appeal in the written submissions filed, confined

herself to one ground of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. The evidence led at the trial warrants the consideration of a lesser

culpability on the basis of knowledge.

It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the actions of

the appellant, which led to the death of the deceased, would fall within the

interpretation of the 3rd limb of section 293 where culpable homicide has been

described. It was her view that on that basis there was no material before the

Court to come to a finding that his actions fall within the definition of murder as

described in section 294, and therefore, the conviction should have been in terms

of section 297 on the basis of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

The submissions of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) was on the basis

that there was no evidence whatsoever placed before the Court to suggest that

Page 6 of 9

this is a death that should be considered in terms of any of the exceptions of

section 294 of the Penal Code. He was of the view that this is a clear case of

murder in terms of section 294 3rd limb given the facts and the circumstances

that led to the death of the child. He brought to the attention of the Court the

evidence of the JMO, where he has observed 18 injuries on the body of the child

and his opinion that the injury caused to the head was an essentially fatal injury.

The learned DSG moved for the dismissal of the appeal on the basis that it has

no merit.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

As the only ground of appeal taken up was on the basis that the conviction

should have been on the basis of culpable homicide not amounting murder,

which means that the appellant is now admitting that it was he who caused

injuries to the child, I find it is unnecessary to go into the facts to find out

whether there was sufficient evidence before the High Court in that regard.

The culpable homicide has been described under section 293 of the Penal Code,

which reads;

293. Whoever caused death by doing an act with the intention of

causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as

is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by

such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.

The learned Counsel for the appellant argued that the incident where the

appellant caused injuries to the deceased falls within the ambit of an action done

with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death.

I am of the view that every death that occurs as a result of an action by another

person towards a deceased falls within any one of the definitions of culpable

homicide as stated in section 293 of the Penal Code.

Culpable homicide becomes murder under following circumstances in terms of

section 294 of the Penal Code.

Page 7 of 9

The relevant part of section 294 reads as follows,

294. Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is

murder-

Firstly- If the act by which the death is caused is done with the

intention of causing death; or

Secondly- If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily

injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of

the person to whom the harm is caused ; or

Thirdly- If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury

to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is

sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or

Fourthly- If the person committing the act knows that it is so

imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause

death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and

commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of

causing death or such injury as aforesaid.

There are five exceptions mentioned in section 294 where culpable homicide can

be termed as culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

If the Court finds in a case of murder, the evidence led only leads to culpable

homicide not amounting to murder, the conviction should be on the basis of any

one or more of the exceptions as mentioned in section 294 and in terms of section

297 of the Penal Code.

During the trial, the appellant has not taken up any defence on the basis that

his actions amount to culpable homicide not amounting to murder. His defence

had been a total denial. The learned High Court Judge has considered the

evidence placed before the Court and has determined that the actions of the

appellant falls within the 2nd limb of section 294, which is causing the bodily

Page 8 of 9

injury knowing very well that it is likely to cause death of the person to whom

the harm is caused.

It is my considered view, arguing that the actions of the appellant should fall

within the definition of section 293 would itself not be sufficient to determine

that the conviction should be in terms of section 297 on the basis of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder.

For this Court to determine that the conviction of murder by the learned High

Court Judge was wrong, there must be reasons adduced by the appellant in that

regard. The appellant must convince the Court that his actions fall within one of

the exceptions of section 294, so that the conviction should have been in terms

of section of the 297 Penal Code.

I find no basis to conclude, given the facts and the circumstances that led to the

death of the child, would fall within any of the exceptions to murder in terms of

the section of the 294 Penal Code.

It is clear from the evidence that the appellant has not taken up any position

before the trial Court other than denying that he was responsible for the death.

It is trite law that even in a situation where an accused person does not take up

the position that his actions amount to culpable homicide not amounting

murder, it is the duty of the trial judge to consider whether there is evidence

placed before the Court that can be concluded that the conviction should be in

terms of section of the 297.

In the case of King Vs. Bellana Withanage Eddin 41 NLR 345, a Court of

Criminal Appeal held thus;

In a charge of murder, it is the duty of the judge to put to the jury, the

alternative of finding the accused guilty of culpable homicide not amounting

to murder when there is any basis for such a finding in the evidence of

record, although such defence was not raised nor relied upon by the

accused.

Page 9 of 9

In King Vs. Albert Appuhamy 41 NLR 505, it was held,

Failure on the part of a prisoner or his counsel to take up a certain line of

defence does not relieve the judge of the responsibility of putting the jury

such defence if it arises on the evidence.

I do not find any evidence in the case record to come to such a conclusion by the

learned trial Judge. Besides that, the JMOs evidence is very much clear that the

injuries caused to the deceased child who was 9 years at that time were

essentially fatal under the given context.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has correctly analyzed the evidence

placed before the Court and had come to a correct finding in that regard when

the appellant was convicted for murder in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no merit in the ground of appeal

urged on behalf of the appellant.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of merit. The conviction and the

sentence affirmed.
