Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the accused appellants (hereinafter sometimes collectively

referred to as the appellants) on being aggrieved of their conviction and the

sentence by the learned High Court Judge of Colombo.

The appellants were indicted before the High Court of Colombo for causing the

death of one Sumith Janaka Fernando on 5th November 2001, and thereby

committing the offence of murder, punishable in terms of section 296 read with

section 32 of the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, the appellants were found guilty as charged by the

learned High Court Judge of Colombo of his judgement dated 18th May 2018,

and accordingly, they were sentenced to death.

Facts in brief

PW-02 Anura Lasantha had been the only eyewitness who has given evidence

at the trial. He was a fishmonger by trade, and had been walking along a

narrow road near a playground in the Nawagampura area when the incident

relevant to the charge occurred. He has gone to the area in order to collect

some debts and also to pay some money owed by him to another. It was after

9.30 p.m. in the night. He has seen a person being held by two others and

another person, whom he has identified as the 1st accused appellant, stabbing

the person held by the other two. He has then seen the person being stabbed

for a second time by one of the other persons who held him.

After the stabbing, all three of them have fled the scene of the crime. He has

identified the second accused appellant as the person who stabbed the

deceased for the 2nd time, while identifying the 3rd accused appellant as one of

the persons who held the deceased along with the 2nd appellant.

According to his evidence, the incident had taken place in front of a boutique

near the playground, but the occupants of the boutique had closed it while this

Page 4 of 22

was going on. He has stated that there was adequate light from the streetlights

in the vicinity. Initially, he has seen the deceased person leaned against a

lamppost just before he was attacked. He has stated that the deceased and his

father who came to the scene after the incident, were unknown to him. It has

also been his evidence that the police came to the scene of the crime soon after

it happened and he pointed out the direction the assailants went to the police.

Subsequently, he has seen the 1st appellant being apprehended by the police.

At an identification parade held before the Magistrate of Colombo, the witness

has identified all three appellants as the persons involved in the crime. He has

also identified the two knives produced in the Court as the knives used by the

1st and the 2nd appellants.

Under cross-examination, the witness has admitted that he was a long time

Heroin addict, but has denied the defence suggestion that he is giving false

evidence because of the friendship he has with the father of the deceased. It

had been his position that he came to know the father of the deceased only

after the incident. It was also his position that he did not observe a funeral at a

house near the place of the incident. He has denied that the appellants were

shown to him at the police station, stating that he saw them only at the

identification parade. However, he has admitted that when the police

apprehended the 1st appellant soon after the incident, he was brought to the

scene of the crime by the police.

The next witness of importance in this matter is PW-04 Chief Inspector of

Police, Anuradha Mahindasiri. He has been on crime prevention duty along

with some other police officers in the Nawagampura area around 21.35 hours

on 5th November 2001. While on patrol, he has been informed that there is a

commotion near a funeral house in the area, and a person had been stabbed.

He had reached the place of the incident soon thereafter, and had found a

person with serious stab wounds in front of a shop belonging to one Lalitha.

Page 5 of 22

The place where he found the injured person had been about 50 meters away

from a funeral house. He had observed a streetlight about 6 meters away from

the shop. One Bernard Fernando has identified the injured as his son, and PW-

04 has instructed him to take the injured to the hospital. At the same time,

another person called Anura Lasantha (PW-02) has informed him that one of

the persons who stabbed the injured person ran away towards a nearby statue.

Upon receiving this information, PW-04, along with another police officer, has

got into a three-wheeler and gone in pursuit of the attacker.

Although he was not informed of any details of the attacker, when he reached

the statue, PW-04 has observed a person attempting to switch on a three-

wheeler, which was parked nearby. With the aid of the nearby streetlights, he

has observed that the person is covered with blood in his hands and the body.

When he pointed the torch he was carrying towards the person, he has

observed blood stains in his left foot as well. Further, upon searching the

person, he has seen a cut injury in his left-hand index finger. He has also

observed him in a panicked state. Accordingly, PW-04 has arrested the person

as a suspect of the incident.

The earlier-mentioned Anura Lasantha has informed PW-04 that the arrested

person was one of the assailants of the injured. He has identified him in the

trial Court as the first appellant.

The prosecution has called the other relevant police witnesses who conducted

investigations into the matter and recovered the two knives as part of the

investigation.

The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who conducted the postmortem has marked

the said report as P-06. She has observed thirty cut and stab wounds on the

body of the deceased. The defence has admitted the fact that the JMO has

observed such injuries on the body in terms of section 420 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act.

Page 6 of 22

It needs to be noted that the prosecuting State Counsel, at the very

commencement of the trial has informed the trial Court that PW-01, who was

the father of the deceased had passed away, and had sought the permission of

the Court to mark the deposition the said witness has made on 12th June 2002

at the Magistrate Court non-summary inquiry in terms of section 33 of the

Evidence Ordinance. Accordingly, the Court has allowed the application.

However, after leading the relevant witnesses at the trial, the prosecuting State

Counsel has concluded that it was not necessary for him to produce the

deposition of PW-01 in terms of section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance and has

closed the case for the prosecution.

When called for a defence, the 1st appellant has made a statement from the

dock and has stated that he is a three-wheeler driver by profession. He has

admitted that he was near the funeral house around 9.00 p.m. on the day of

the incident. It had been his opposition that while he was there, an altercation

commenced amongst the people who were at the funeral house and he was also

chased away from that place as a result. He has taken up the position that

when he was starting his three-wheeler to go home, the police came and

apprehended him and there were no bloodstains on his body or clothes and the

police are fabricating evidence against him.

He has claimed that PW-02 was a friend of the deceaseds father. It was his

contention that he had no connection whatsoever to the incident and was

innocent of the charges.

The 2nd appellant has given evidence in the Court under oath. It had been his

position that the house he and his family members lived was a very small

house, therefore, he was in the habit of sleeping for the night in a nearby

abandoned house. It was his position that when he was arrested by police, as

pointed out by the 1st appellant, the 3rd appellant who was a friend of him was

Page 7 of 22

also sleeping in the mentioned house. He has denied any involvement to the

crime.

The 3rd appellant had also given evidence under oath and has maintained the

same position as that of the 2nd appellant. He has admitted that he was taken

to another house where a knife was recovered. However, it was his position

that the said knife recovered from that house was a knife used for household

work, and it had nothing to do with the alleged incident.

In this matter, as the prosecution has decided not to lead the deposition of PW-

01, the defence has taken steps to produce and mark the deposition made by

PW-01 at the non-summary inquiry held before the Magistrate Court as Y.

What is relevant of this deposition is the fact that the deceased has made a

dying declaration to his father at the scene of the crime, before he was taken to

the hospital. When questioned as to what happened, the deceased has

informed his father that it was Aslam, referring to the 1st appellant, who did

this to him. The PW-01 has been specific in his deposition that his son did not

inform him about any involvement of other persons. In his deposition he has

stated that, if it has been recorded as his son informed him that Aslam and two

others stabbed in the statement he made to the police, it was wrong.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Assigned Counsel for the 1st accused

appellant formulated the following grounds of appeal for consideration of the

Court.

1. The conviction of the 1st appellant was contrary to the law and against

the weight of the evidence led before the trial Court.

2. The learned High Court Judge has failed to take into consideration,

the unrealistic and improbable evidence of prosecution witnesses.

Page 8 of 22

3. The learned High Court Judge has failed to apply his judicial mind to

the fact that the prosecution has failed to prove the charge beyond

reasonable doubt.

4. The learned High Court Judge has failed to properly analyze the

defence evidence.

5. The 1st accused appellant has been denied of a fair trial since the

learned High Court Judge has been prejudiced even before the

evaluation of the defence evidence.

The learned Counsel for the 2nd accused appellant formulated the following

grounds of appeal.

6. The evidence of the sole eyewitness is not safe to be relied upon, as

there were several material contradictions in his evidence.

7. The evidence regarding the section 27 statement is suspicious and

was unsafe to rely upon.

8. The learned High Court Judge has failed to take into consideration,

the evidence that has been given by the father of the deceased (PW-01)

in his deposition which favours the appellant.

9. The defence evidence has been wrongfully rejected.

On behalf of the 3rd appellant, the learned Presidents Counsel urged the

following grounds of appeal.

10. The learned trial Judge failed to carefully analyze the evidence of the

only eyewitness in the light of the infirmities and improbabilities of his

evidence.

11. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the strong

conflicting evidence between the father of the deceased and the only

eyewitness for the prosecution.

Page 9 of 22

12. The learned Trial Judge did not carefully consider the medical

evidence and has held that the medical evidence corroborated the

eyewitness due to a wrong analysis.

13. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the fact that the

investigating officers had acted in a biased manner and had fabricated

evidence against the 3rd appellant.

14. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the mode of

identification of the 3rd appellant by the eyewitness was doubtful, in

its correct perspective.

It was the position of the learned Counsel for the 1st appellant that PW-02 who

was supposed to be the only eyewitness is not a credible witness for several

reasons. It was pointed out that, admittedly, he was a Heroin addict and may

have had the tendency to fabricate a story with the intention of receiving

favours from the law enforcement authorities. Pointing to several instances of

his evidence, which he termed as contradictory to each other, it was his

position that PW-02 has stated that the deceased person and his father were

unknown to him. However, at a later stage of his evidence, he has stated that

he speaks to the father when he meets him. It was also shown that at the

postmortem, PW-02 was one of the persons who have identified the body of the

deceased as a neighbour of him.

Furthermore, it was stated that PW-02 has given evidence to say that he did

not see a funeral house near the place of the incident, however PW-04, the

police officer who reached the place soon after the incident has clearly stated

that there was a funeral house about 50 meters away. It was the position of the

learned Counsel that even as to the time where he has made his statement to

the police, he has been contradictory. At one stage of his evidence, he has

stated that he made the statement on the same night, but later he has stated

Page 10 of 22

that it was in the morning of the following day, and yet again, later in his

evidence has stated that it was in the afternoon at 3.30 p.m.

Referring to the prosecutions failure to mark the deposition made by PW-01 at

the non-summary inquiry even after informing the Court that it would be so

marked, it was the position of the learned Counsel that it was not done

because, if marked, it would have further established that PW-02s evidence

was not reliable. The learned Counsel contended further, that the learned High

Court Judge has believed the evidence of PW-02 at the very commencement of

his judgement and even before he considered the evidence led on behalf of the

defence. It was his view that this approach of the learned High Court Judge

has denied a fair trial towards his client.

It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the 2nd appellant, that the 2nd

appellant was arrested by the police while he was sleeping in a house where

the 3rd appellant was also sleeping. It was his position that although the police

witnesses say a weapon was recovered upon his statement, the appellant never

gave such a statement nor was he allowed to read the statement before he was

asked to sign. It was also his position that the 2nd appellant was shown to PW-

02 and that was the reason why he identified him at the identification parade.

The stand taken up by the learned Counsel to argue that the evidence of PW-02

was not credible, was that he was never an eyewitness to the incident, but

because he was a friend of the father of the deceased, he volunteered to give

evidence, and he has been coaxed by the police to implicate the 2nd appellant.

He pointed to the evidence where PW-02 who has stated that when the

stabbing took place, the deceased was leaning against a lamppost, and to the

place where the deceased was found injured in front of a shop nearby. It was

his position that this discrepancy shows that the witness has not seen the

incident and there exist a serious doubt in that regard. He contended that this

discrepancy has not drawn the attention of the learned High Court Judge.

Page 11 of 22

It was also the position of the learned Counsel that although the witness PW-

02 has claimed that he did not know the deceaseds father, the evidence points

otherwise, and it was his contention that they were well known to each other. It

was also contended that the witness PW-02 has admitted that he went to the

police station around 10.30 a.m. on the following day and by that time, the 2nd

and 3rd appellants were in police custody. It was his position that they were

shown to the witness at the police station enabling him to identify them at the

identification parade. It was also his position that police evidence had been

contradictory in this regard.

It was the position of the learned Counsel that in the evidence, it has been

stated that the 2nd appellant was taken to the place of the incident around the

same time where the inquest was also held by the Magistrate. Hence, there was

a strong possibility of PW-02 seeing the 2nd appellant before the identification

parade. It was his position that since PW-02 was not a cogent witness, his

evidence should not have been accepted without sufficient corroboration.

It was pointed out to the dying declaration made to PW-01 where the deceased

has mentioned only the name of the 1st appellant as the person who stabbed

him. It was his position that given the contradictory nature of the evidence, it

would be unsafe to allow the conviction of the 2nd appellant to stand.

It was pointed out further that the learned High Court Judge in his judgement

has considered the contents of the statement made by the accused to the police

as substantive evidence and thereby had misdirected as to the relevant law.

Agreeing with the submissions of the learned Counsel representing the 1st and

the 2nd appellant, it was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel on

behalf of the 3rd appellant that, since the learned High Court Judge has

rejected the dying deposition of PW-01, the case has been determined solely

relying on the evidence of the supposed only eyewitness. It was his position

Page 12 of 22

that although evidence of a solitary witness can be relied upon to a prove a

case, it can be done only if that witness was cogent and trustworthy.

The learned Presidents Counsel contended that the learned trial Judge has

failed to give adequate reasons as to why he is accepting the evidence of PW-

02, given the discrepancies in his evidence. It was his position that PW-02 was

a witness planted by the police to establish their case, and it was highly

doubtful whether any witness could identify the knife or knives used to commit

the crime under the light conditions that existed, and given the facts and the

circumstances.

He too pointed out the possible reasons as to why the prosecution who initially

wanted to produce the deposition made by PW-01 at the non-summary inquiry

as evidence, later decided not to do so, because, if produced, it would have

been detrimental to the prosecution case.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) representing the Hon. Attorney

General submitted that a witness being a Heroin addict is not a reason by itself

to doubt his evidence. She cited what was stated by Anil Gooneratne, J. in the

case of C. A. Sisira Bandula alias Mahathun Vs. The Attorney General CA

122/2006 decided on 09-10-2014 to support her contention.

It was her position that PW-02 was a credible and trustworthy witness, and

there had been no acceptable issues raised as to the credibility of his evidence

at the trial. It was her position that PW-02 has been consistent in saying that

he did not know the deceased and his father before the incident, and later in

his evidence saying he speaks to the father, cannot be interpreted to say that

the witness had not been truthful in that regard.

Referring to the identification of the deceased at the postmortem, it was her

position that PW-02 has identified the body as the person who was stabbed at

the incident.

Page 13 of 22

It was submitted by the learned DSG that the rejection of the PW-01s

deposition to Magistrate Court led in terms of section 33 of the Evidence

Ordinance was correct, although the approach that led to the conclusion to

reject such evidence by the learned trial Judge may be wrong.

It was contended that the postmortem report has indicated that there had been

16 stab wounds as well as 12 cut injuries on the body of the deceased, which

supports the evidence of PW-02 that several persons were involved in this

attack. It was her position that the evidence led to establish the recovery of the

murder weapons had not been properly challenged by the appellants at the

trial. It was her argument that there can be no basis to the argument that PW-

02 has not seen the incident, given the distance from the lamppost to the place

where the deceased was found injured.

The learned DSG took up the position that the evidence adduced against all

three appellants at the trial Court has been strong and cogent, and the

evidence against the 1st appellant had been much stronger, given the fact that

the evidence of PW-02 had been well corroborated by the other evidence

adduced before the trial Court.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

Although 14 grounds of appeal were raised by the learned Counsel on behalf of

the three appellants, I would now proceed to consider them taken as a whole,

since most of the grounds urged are similar, and interrelated.

At the very outset, it needs to be mentioned that I am in no position to agree

with the contention that PW-02 was an unreliable witness because he was a

Heroin addict, and he may have come forward as a witness expecting favour

from the authorities.

As appointed out correctly by the learned DSG, even a Heroin addict or any

other witness who may have a bad record, need not necessarily be treated with

Page 14 of 22

suspicion unless there is material to conclude that such a witness was not

credible and trustworthy.

As pointed out correctly, in the case of Sisira Bandula alias Mahathun Vs.

The Attorney General (Supra), where a drug peddlers evidence given on

behalf of an accused had been rejected by the learned trial Judge, it was held

at page 21 of the judgement,

Per Anil Gooneratne, J.

I find a total misdirection of the Trial Judge at folios 420-419 where

Tarzans testimonial trustworthiness had been analyzed and rejected. The

basis of rejection has been summarized by the Trial Judge as regards

Tarzan. It is stated that witness Tarzan is a drug peddler. He has

consumed drugs for over 15 years. He daily consumes drugs. (Twice a

day) Tarzan has been convicted by a Court of law for possession and

trafficking, etc. These are items of evidence admitted into the evidence of

Tarzan. It is a misdirection of law to conclude that he is an untruthful

witness on account of above. There is no denial by Tarzan of above. Trial

judge states that a person in the caliber of Tarzan, who is a drug addict

and such evidence is untrustworthy of credit when he is called upon to

give evidence on behalf of another drug trafficker or drug peddler. Trial

Judges view is that Tarzan has a distorted mind is on one hand

unsupported by medical evidence. TC has failed to analyze Tarzans

evidence in an unbiased manner and without importing personal

knowledge of the witness and as such it cannot be a good ground to reject

his testimony in Court. A witness can be rich, poor, disabled, person

convicted of an offence, suffer mental disability during lucid periods,

person of young age etc. what is important is not the character- position

but the evidence that transpires in Court is trustworthy or has credence or

not. Whatever the person is, can the Court rely on the evidence led in Court

and not based on his position in life.

Page 15 of 22

It was the submission of the learned Counsel that PW-02 cannot be considered

a credible witness because of several contradictory positions taken up by him

while giving evidence. It was pointed out that in his evidence, PW-02 has

claimed that the deceased person was unknown to him as well as his father. It

has been the position of the appellants that they were well known to PW-02

and since the deceaseds father was a close friend, and it was at the instigation

of the father, the PW-02 is giving evidence to claim that he saw the incident.

It is clear from the evidence of PW-02 when taken as a whole, he has been

consistent in saying that the deceased and his father were unknown to him.

Although he has been cross-examined at length on this, he has maintained his

position right throughout. Nearing the conclusion of his cross-examination,

while answering a question, he has stated that when he goes to sell fish, he

speaks to the father when seen.

The relevant question and answer read as follows:

: ?

: . .

The witness has given evidence some eight years after the incident. It is clear

from his evidence what he has stated was that the deceased and the father was

unknown to him at the time of the incident. The line of cross-examination

which led to the answer reproduced above shows that the questioning has been

as to the status of the relationship between him and the father of the deceased

at present, that means during the time he faced the cross-examination. It is

clear that the witness has built up a relationship with the father of the

deceased as a result of this incident, and him being involved as a witness. That

may be the reason why he has stated that when he meets the father of the

deceased, he used to talk with him. I do not find anything contradictory in the

stand taken up by PW-02 in that regard.

Page 16 of 22

When it comes to the fact that it was the PW-02 who has identified the body of

the deceased along with the father before the postmortem, I find no reason to

consider it as a fact that leads to a conclusion that the deceased, his father and

PW-02 were known to each other. If one looks at the relevant evidence in its

correct perspective, it can be seen that the witness has been present from the

time of the incident and even at the postmortem. It is clear from his evidence

that before the JMO, he has come forward to identify the body as the person

who was injured during the incident. Although the JMO has stated that he was

a neighbour, there is no material before the Court to conclude under what

circumstances the JMO has stated so.

I do not find it as a reason to lower the credibility of the evidence of PW-02.

Further, saying in his evidence that he did not see a funeral house is also not a

reason to doubt the credibility of the witness. It may well be he was telling the

truth when he stated so in his evidence. According to his evidence, what he

had seen first was the incident where the stabbing took place. Obviously, as a

result, there had been a commotion where several others have gathered. The

police too have come to the seen soon thereafter. It may well be that the

incident has overwhelmed the witness. Under the circumstances, his failure to

observe a funeral house some 50 meters away is quite understandable in my

view.

Giving evidence in Court, while stating that the deceased was standing near a

lamppost when the attack took place, he has also stated that this happened in

front of Lalithas boutique, and as soon as this incident took place, the

boutique was closed. According to the police evidence, the distance between the

lamppost and the place where the deceased was found fallen with bleeding

injuries was six meters. I am unable to agree that this was a material

contradiction under these circumstances.

Page 17 of 22

The learned High Court Judge has well considered this fact in his judgement

and has come to a finding that this do not create a doubt as to the evidence of

PW-02, for which I have no reason to disagree.

The learned Counsel in the submission before this Court contended that the

appellant has given various times, as to when he gave his statement to police.

He has stated that he went to the police station after the incident around 10.30

in the night and made a statement. However, it is clear from the police evidence

that his statement has been recorded at 3.30 a.m. on the following day. I do

not find any discrepancy in that, because it may well be that when the witness

went to the police station, he has narrated what happened, but his statement

may have been recorded only at 3.30 in the morning.

In this matter, although I find no credibility issues in the evidence of PW-02, I

find, the Turnbull guidelines enunciated in the case of Regina Vs. Turnbull

(1977) QB 224 should have also been considered in the analysis of PW-02s

evidence, since a person who is convinced that he saw and identified the

persons, may still be wrong given the facts and the circumstances.

The said Turnbull guidelines require a trial Judge to be mindful that;

Caution is required to avoid the risk of injustice.

A witness who is honest may be wrong even if they are

convinced, they are right.

A witness who is convincing may still be wrong.

More than one witness may be wrong.

A witness who recognizes the defendant even when the

witness knows the defendant well may be wrong.

Page 18 of 22

A judge should also examine the circumstances in which the identification by

each witness can be made. Some of these circumstances may include;

The length of time the accused was observed by the witness.

The distance the witness was from the accused.

The state of the light.

The length of time elapsed between the original observation and

the subsequent identification to the police.

The case of Sigera Vs. The Attorney General (2011) 1 SLR 201 was a case

the question of the identity of the accused had been discussed. It was held:

The identification was not in a difficult circumstance or in a multitude of

persons in a crowd or in a fleeting moment. To apply the Turnbull

principles, the identification had to be made under difficult circumstances.

In this case, although the incident took place during night, there was

ample light shed by the bulb of the lamppost that was burning. There was

no congregation of multitude of persons in a crowd but only the accused

appellant and the deceased. In order to inflict the injuries on the deceased,

the assailant had to come very close to the deceased.

In the incident where the PW-02 has seen the stabbing, the evidence

establishes that it has happened within a very short period of time and the PW-

02 has had a very little time to observe.

Under the circumstances, it is my considered view that it was necessary for the

trial Court to look for some kind of corroboration of the evidence of PW-02.

The evidence led in this action shows that the police have arrived at the scene

of the crime soon after the incident and it was the PW-02 who has shown the

direction where the assailants had fled. Police officers have been able to

apprehend the 1st appellant while he was attempting to switch on a three-

wheeler parked nearby, presumably to flee the area. When he was stopped by

the police, he was having blood on his body as stated in the evidence, and even

Page 19 of 22

had a cut injury in his index finger. This establishes a strong corroboration of

the evidence of PW-02 as to the involvement of the 1st accused of the crime.

When a defence was called, the 1st appellant has made a dock statement and

has claimed that he was at the funeral house nearby, where there was a clash

between some parties, and when he was attempting to leave the place of the

clash, he was arrested.

I find that the 1st appellant has failed to put this position to PW-02 when he

gave evidence. The police officer who reached the place of the incident soon

after the stabbing and arrested the 1st appellant, he has stated in his evidence

that the first information they received was about a clash at a funeral house in

the area. However, the police evidence is clear that there had been no clash at

the funeral house, but the information relates to the place where the deceased

was attacked.

It appears that the claim of a clash at the funeral house was an afterthought by

the 1st appellant in order to match his defence with the police evidence.

However, he has failed to explain the blood found on his body and even the cut

injury received by him. In view of the fact that there had been no clash other

than the incident where the deceased received injuries, the only irrefutable

conclusion would be that the 1st appellant was one of the persons who caused

injuries to the deceased.

I am of the view that these established facts have provided sufficient

corroboration of the evidence of PW-02 in relation to the 1st appellant's

involvement in the crime.

Although the learned High Court Judge has decided to not to act on the

deposition by PW-01 who was the father of the deceased made at the non-

summary proceedings before the Magistrate Court for a different reason, I am

in no position to agree with the conclusion reached in that regard. In this

matter, at the very commencement of the trial, the prosecution has sought the

Page 20 of 22

permission of the Court to lead the deposition made by PW-01 before the

Magistrate Court in the non-summary proceedings since PW-01 was dead at

that time, which the Court has allowed. However, the prosecution has later

decided not to produce the relevant evidence. The defence has decided to

produce that piece of evidence when the appellants were called upon for a

defence.

In his deposition before the Magistrate Court, PW-01 has spoken about a dying

declaration made to him by the deceased at the scene of the crime. According

to police evidence, when the police arrived soon after the incident, the deceased

was alive and in pain. Hence, I find that when the father says he spoke to his

son, and asked what happened, that evidence needs to be taken as credible,

since any natural reaction of a parent who sees his or her son with serious cut

injuries would be to ask what happened.

According to the fathers deposition, the deceased has stated it was Aslam who

attacked him, which amounts to a dying declaration made by the deceased as

to the cause of his injuries which led to his ultimate death. I am of the view

that when the evidence against the 1st appellant taken as a whole, this also has

provided sufficient corroboration of what the PW-02 says as to what he saw, in

relation to the involvement of the 1st appellant to the crime.

However, I am unable to say the same with regard to the evidence against the

2nd and the 3rd appellants. The only evidence against them is the evidence of

PW-02 who says that they were also involved in the attack on the deceased. As

I have already decided that although the evidence of PW-02 can be considered

credible, there should be corroboration of his evidence in relation to the

involvement of the 2nd and 3rd appellants as well, for the Court to act on the

evidence.

In his deposition before the Magistrate Court non-summary inquiry, PW-01 has

been clear that what his son told him was only about the 1st appellant and

Page 21 of 22

nothing about the 2nd and 3rd appellants. It appears from the judgement that

the learned High Court Judge has decided not to act on his deposition because

of the discrepancy that has been brought to the notice of the Court. When PW-

01 was examined in the Magistrate Court in relation to the statement he made

to the police, where he has referred to Aslam and two others as what was

stated by his son to him. The father has categorically denied that he has stated

to the police about two others. If taken as it is, the evidence of the PW-02 in

relation to the involvement of the 2nd and the 3rd appellant would create a

doubt as to whether he was correct in involving the 2nd and the 3rd appellant as

well, to the incident.

Considering the guidance provided by the Turnbull principles, I am of the view,

if taken in the correct perspective, although PW-02 may be correct to think

what he saw was the involvement of the 2nd and 3rd appellants, the dying

declaration of the deceased to his father would not provide supportive evidence

in that regard.

When there is evidence that can be interpreted in different ways, the

interpretation that favours the accused person should be preferred.

In the case of Alim Vs. Wijesinghe, S.I. Police Batticaloa, 38 CLW 95, it was

held that; where the same facts are capable of inference in favour of the

accused and also of an inference against him, the inference consistent with his

innocence should be preferred.

I am of the view that there had been no corroboration of the evidence against

the 2nd and 3rd appellants and in view of the dying declaration which had been

admitted in terms of section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance, it was not safe for

the learned High Court Judge to conclude that the charges against the 2nd and

3rd appellants had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

For the reasons as adduced above, I find merit in the grounds of appeal urged

on behalf of the 2nd and 3rd appellants.

Accordingly, I set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed against them

and acquit them of the charge preferred against them.

For the reasons as stated above, I find no merit in the grounds of appeal urged

on behalf of the 1st appellant, hence, his appeal against the conviction and the

sentence is hereby dismissed.
