Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the respondent-appellant-petitioners (hereinafter referred to

as the appellants) in terms of section 34 of the Right to Information Act No.12 of

2016 read with Article 138 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist

Republic of Sri Lanka, on being aggrieved by the order dated 02-02-2021

pronounced by the Right to Information Commission.

At the hearing of this appeal, all parties agreed for the pronouncement of the

judgement in this matter based on written submissions by the parties, as all the

matters that need consideration in this appeal are matters of law. Hence, all the

parties were allowed to tender their respective written submissions for the

consideration of the Court.

The order under appeal is an order pronounced by the Right to Information

Commission (hereinafter referred to as the Commission) in terms of section 32

of the Right to Information Act No.12 of 2016 (The RTI Act) in pursuant to an

appeal preferred by the appellant-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

respondent) challenging the refusal by the Designated Officer of the Parliament

of Sri Lanka to issue him with the information requested by him from the

Information Officer of the Parliament.

The respondent by his letter dated 21-06-2018 had requested the following

information from the Information Officer of the Parliament.

1. The list of names of members of Parliament who have handed over their

respective declarations of assets and liabilities in 2018.

2. The list of names of MPs who have handed over their declarations from

2010 up to the date of his request.

Page 6 of 17

The Information Officer by his letter dated 21-08-2018 has refused the request

on the basis that he has to make an application in terms of the Declaration of

the Assets and Liabilities Act of Act No.1 of 1975 to the Speaker of Parliament,

which is a separate Act that governs the declarations of the Members of

Parliament. The Designated Officer too has held the same view in rejecting the

appeal preferred by the respondent to him in that regard, in terms of section 31

of the RTI Act.

The respondent being aggrieved by the decision of the Designated Officer has

appealed to the Commission in terms of section 32 of the RTI Act, challenging

the decision. After hearing the parties, the Commission, by the order appealed

against, has reversed the decision of the Designated Officer and had ordered that

the information requested by the respondent shall be released to him.

The Grounds of Appeal

In their petition of appeal, the appellants have urged the following grounds of

appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. The said Order is wrong and contrary to law.

2. The Commission erred in law by concluding that the Parliament of Sri

Lanka is the relevant Public Authority in the case of the information

requested by the respondent.

3. The Commission erred in law and fact by failing to appreciate that even

the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition have separate

Information Officers and Designated Officers.

4. The Commission erred in law and fact by failing to appreciate that it is

the Speaker of Parliament who has possession, custody, or control of

the information requested by the respondent.

5. The Commission erred in law when it held that the Parliament has

institutional possession, custody and control of the information

requested.

Page 7 of 17

6. The Commission erred in law by concluding that there is no

impediment for the Secretary General of Parliament to release the

requested information.

7. The Commission erred in law in failing to appreciate that the DALL is a

special law which regulates all aspects relating to Declarations of Assets

and Liabilities in Sri Lanka.

8. The Commission erred in law in failing to appreciate that the DALL will

prevail over the provisions of the Right to Information Act No. 12 of

2016, which is a general law, in accordance with the well-established

maxim Generalia Specialibus Non Derogat.

9. The Commission erred in law in failing to appreciate that the

Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No.1 of 1975 specifically

prohibits the disclosure of a declaration of assets and liabilities except

in the manner set out under the said Law.

10. The Commission erred in law in failing to appreciate that a person can

only obtain information pertaining to the Declarations of Assets and

Liabilities if such person makes an application to the appropriate

authority in accordance with section 5 (3) of the DALL and not under

the Right to Information Act.

11. The Commission erred in law in failing to consider section 11 of the

Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No.1 of 1975 which provides

that where the provisions of the DALL are in conflict or inconsistent

with the provisions of any other law, the provisions of the DALL shall

prevail.

12. The Commission erred in law in failing to give effect to section 8 (1) of

the DALL which mandates the Speaker and any person authorized by

the Speaker to have access to any papers and records in the course of

their official duties, to maintain secrecy with regard to any declaration

of assets and liabilities received under the DALL.

13. The Commission erred in law in failing to appreciate that in terms of 8

(3) of the DALL, the Speaker and any person authorized by him is

Page 8 of 17

precluded from producing the declaration of assets and liabilities or any

document connected therewith or from or divulging or communicating

any matter or thing in relation thereto to any Court including the Right

to Information Commission, except in proceedings instituted under the

DALL or the Bribery Act, The Exchange Control Act, The Inland

Revenue Act and The Customs Ordinance.

14. The Commission erred in law in failing to appreciate that the

Declaration of Assets and Liabilities of the Members of Parliament

constitute personal information, the disclosure of which would lead to

an unwarranted invasion of privacy.

15. The Commission erred in law when it failed to appreciate that the

disclosure of information pertaining to the Declaration of Assets and

Liabilities of the Members of Parliament under the Right to Information

Act would constitute a breach of the powers and privileges of

Parliament.

Although the appellants have taken up 15 grounds of appeal, I will now proceed

to consider the said grounds of appeal together as they are interrelated.

In this matter, the respondent has presented his request for the required

information to the Information Officer of the Sri Lanka Parliament by his letter

dated 21-06-2018 (document marked P-3 with the appeal). It is clear from the

letter of refusal by the Information Officer and also by the determination of the

Designated Officer (documents marked P-4 and P-6 with this appeal) that their

refusal to provide the information requested had been on the basis that the sole

authority with regard to the declaration of assets and liabilities by the members

of Parliament is the Speaker of the Parliament in terms of Declaration of Assets

and Liabilities Law No.1 of 1975 as amended by Amendment Act No.74 of 1988.

It has been determined that the Right to Information Act has no application in

this instance since section 11 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law

has provided that where the provisions of the said law are in conflict or

Page 9 of 17

inconsistent with the provisions of any other law, the provisions of this law shall

prevail. Hence, the request has been denied on the basis that the respondent

should make his request to the Speaker of the Parliament and not to the

Information Officer of the Parliament.

In their submissions before the Commission, the appellants have strenuously

contended that the Office of the Speaker of the Parliament and the Office of the

Secretary General of the Parliament under which the Information Officer and the

Designated Officer function are two separate and distinct institutions, in order

to justify the decisions made by the Information Officer and the Designated

Officer. It had been their stand that the information requested by the respondent

is in the possession, custody or control of the Speaker of the Parliament and the

Secretary General of the Parliament is in no position to interfere with the

functions of the Speaker.

It has also been urged that disclosure of any information on the assets and

liabilities of the parliamentarians under the Right to Information Act would

constitute a breach of the powers and privileges of the Parliament.

The Commission, after well considering the arguments presented on behalf of

the appellants as well as the respondent had determined that the public

authority in terms of the RTI Act being the Parliament of Sri Lanka and only one

Information Officer and a Designated Officer have been appointed in relation to

the said public authority, it is the duty of the Secretary General of the Parliament

to provide the information requested by the respondent.

It has been determined that although the Speaker of Parliament is a separate

institution within the Parliament of Sri Lanka, as the Chief Executive Officer of

the Parliament, it is the duty of the Secretary General to provide the information

requested, which would not amount to any breach of the privileges of the

Members of the Parliament. It has also been determined that secrecy and the

confidentiality of the declaration of assets and liabilities by the Members of the

Parliament would not be violated in terms of the Declaration of Assets and

Page 10 of 17

Liabilities law as what the respondent requesting is not the details of the

declarations tendered, but only a list of the Members of the Parliament who filed

their declarations of assets and liabilities in accordance with the law.

The Commission has well discussed the reasons for their determination by

considering the relevant laws as well as legal precedence set by way of

judgements pronounced by our Superior Courts as well as Indian Courts under

similar circumstances.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

For the purposes of determining this appeal, I find that it becomes necessary to

consider the relevant provisions of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law

No.1 of 1975 as amended, since both the Information Officer and the Designated

Officer have taken cover of the said Law to refuse the request made by the

respondent.

Towards this, I find it necessary to draw my attention to the purpose of enacting

the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law in 1975 and the Right to

Information Act No.12 of 2016 in the year 2016.

The preamble of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No.1 of 1975 reads

as follows;

A LAW TO COMPEL CERTAIN SPECIFIED CATEGORIES OF PERSONS

TO MAKE PERIODIC DECLARATIONS OF THEIR ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES IN AND OUTSIDE SRI LANKA; TO PROVIDE FOR

REFERNCE TO BE MADE TO SUCH DECLARATIONS BY APPROPRIATE

AUTHORITIES AND FOR INVESTIGATIONS TO BE CONDUCTED UPON

THE RECEIPT OF ANY COMMUNICATION AGAINST A PERSON TO

WHOM THIS LAW APPLIES; TO PROVIDE FOR PENALTIES FOR NON-

DECLARATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND OR FALSE

DECLARATIONS; AND TO PROVIDE FOR MATTERS CONNECTED

THEREWITH OR INCIDENTAL THERETO.

Page 11 of 17

The preamble of the RTI Act which was enacted more than 40 years after the

Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law came into being, reads as follows.

AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION;

TO SPECIFY GROUNDS ON WHICH ACCESS MAY BE DENIED; TO

ESTABLISH THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION COMMISSION; TO

APPOINT INFORMATION OFFICERS; TO SET OUT THE PROCEDURE

AND MATTERS CONNECTED THEREWITH OR INCIDENTAL

THERETO.

WHEREAS the Constitution guarantees the right of access to

information in Article 14A thereof and there exists a need to foster a

culture of transparency and accountability in public authorities by

giving effect to the right of access to information and thereby

promote a society in which the people of Sri Lanka would be able to

more fully participate in public life through combating corruption and

promoting accountability and good governance.

It is clear if one looks at the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law, the purpose

of enacting the same had been to combat corruption in public life by compelling

the persons to whom the Law shall apply to declare their assets and liabilities

periodically.

In terms of section 4 (b) of the Law, the Members of the Parliament who do not

fall into the category mentioned in section 4 (a) shall make their declaration of

assets and liabilities to the Speaker of the Parliament.

It needs to be noted that if any person who is required by law to provide his or

her declaration of assets and liabilities, fails, makes any false statement, fails

without reasonable cause to give additional information as required by Bribery

Commissioner or contravenes any provision of this law shall be guilty of an

offence, and upon conviction before a Magistrate, liable to a fine not exceeding

Rs.1000/- or imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding one

year or both such fine and imprisonment.

Page 12 of 17

It is abundantly clear that by enacting RTI Act No.12 of 2016, the intention of

the legislature had been to give effect more robustly to the provisions of the

Constitution by fostering a culture of transparency and accountability in public

authorities and institutions by giving effect to the right of access to information

in combatting corruption and promoting accountability and good governance.

It needs to be reminded that it is for the very purpose that the legislature by its

wisdom has enacted and introduced Article 14A by the 19th Amendment to the

Constitution of the Republic, where right to access to information has been

enshrined as a fundamental right.

I am of the view that when interpreting the provisions of the RTI Act, it is in this

spirit of the intentions of the legislature, the relevant Act or Acts should be

interpreted by the relevant authority and not to take cover in order to avoid

providing the information asked for, unless such information can be denied in

terms of section 5 of the RTI Act.

Even in instances where the RTI Act provides for the denial of access to

information, it has been stated that if the public interest in disclosing the

information outweighs the harm that would result in its disclosure, such

information should be released.

The relevant section 5 (4) of the RTI Act reads as follows.

5 (4). Notwithstanding the provision of (1), a request for information

shall not be refused where the public interest in disclosing the

information outweigh the harm that would result from its disclosure.

As determined correctly by the Commission, I find no basis for the argument that

since section 11 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law provides that

the provisions of that law, when in conflict or inconsistent with the provisions of

any other law, the provisions of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law

shall prevail and hence, the provisions of RTI Act have no application.

Page 13 of 17

Section 11 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law reads as follows.

11. Where the provisions of this law are in conflict or inconsistent

with the provisions of any other law, the provisions of this law shall

prevail.

On the contrary, the relevant provision of the RTI Act which is section 4 of the

Act reads as follows.

4. The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding

anything to the contrary in any other written law and accordingly in

the event of any inconsistency or conflict between the provisions of

this Act and such other written law, the provisions of this law shall

prevail.

It is abundantly clear from the language used in the RTI Act that the intention

of the legislature in enacting the section 4 of the RTI Act had been to allow the

provisions of the Act to prevail over any other written law in the event of any

inconsistency or conflict between the Acts.

As considered by the Commission, in the Indian case of M.R. Misra Vs. The

Supreme Court of India (CIC/SM/A/2011/000237/Secretary General)

dealing specifically with laws that are in conflict with the Right to Information

Act of India, it has been stated that,

Where there is any inconsistency in a law as regards furnishing of

information, such law shall be superseded by the RTI Act. Insertion of a non-

obstante clause in section 22 of the RTI Act was a conscious choice of

Parliament to safeguard the citizens fundamental right to information If

the PIO has received a request for information under RTI Act, the information

shall be provided to the applicant as per the provisions of the RTI Act and

any denial of the same must be in accordance with section 8 and 9 of the

RTI Act only.

Page 14 of 17

Referring to statutes where there can be two possible interpretations, N.S.

Bindra in his book Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edition at page 346 states

that,

Whenever the language of the legislature admits of two constructions and

if construed in one way, would lead to obvious injustice, the Courts act upon

the view that such a result could not have been intended, unless the

intention had been manifested in express words. Again, out of the two

interpretations, that which ends in the furtherance of the object of the statute

should be preferred to the one that would frustrate it. (S.N. Roy Vs. Geetha

Mazumdar 1978 BLJ 182) Courts have settled that in the course of

interpretation, if the Court is faced alternative is to be chosen which will be

consistent with the smooth working of the system which the statute purports

to be regulating and that alternative is to be rejected which will introduce

uncertainty, friction or confusion which the working of the system.

It is my considered view that the provisions of the RTI Act shall prevail over the

provisions of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law when it comes to

providing information as required by the RTI, subjected to the limitation imposed

in terms of section 5 of the RTI Act.

I am of the view that it is not open to any Information Officer or a Designated

Officer of a public authority to deny information to frustrate the very intention

of the legislature when the RTI Act was enacted in order to expand the scope of

combatting corruption, promoting accountability and good governance.

I am in no position to agree with the stand taken up by the appellants before the

Commission that, if provided, the information requested would violate the rights

and privileges of the Members of Parliament.

It appears that the above argument has been advanced on the basis of the section

8 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law, where preservation of secrecy

and the oath of secrecy of the declaration of assets and liabilities has been

ensured.

Page 15 of 17

As determined rightly by the Commission, I am of the view that providing the list

of names of the Members of Parliament who have tendered their declaration of

assets and liabilities as required by law is not disclosing the information they

have provided in the declarations. I find that the argument advanced on that

basis had also been an attempt to frustrate the purposes of the RTI Act.

Members of Parliament are persons who are elected by the people and

maintained by the people. They are expected to abide by the laws of the country

at all time and provide examples for others to follow. Under the provisions of the

Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law, any person who comes under the

provisions of the Law, fails to provide the relevant declaration of assets and

liabilities as required, would be committing an offence punishable with a fine or

imprisonment of either description or both such fine and imprisonment.

It is therefore important for the public to know whether the relevant authorities

have acted as required by law or not. The only way to obtain that information

would be by seeking the list of the name of the Members of Parliament who have

provided their declarations under the RTI Act.

I find that under no circumstances, providing such a list would amount to

providing the details of the assets and liabilities of each Member of Parliament.

The Commission has well considered the contention that the declaration of

assets and liabilities made by the Parliamentarians has to be provided to the

Speaker of the Parliament and not to the Secretary General, hence the Secretary

General is not in a position to issue directions to the Speaker, and also the

position that the Speaker of the Parliament and the Secretary General of the

Parliament are two distinct positions.

There cannot be any argument that the Parliament of Sri Lanka as a public

authority is an institution that comes under the purview of the RTI Act. That is

the very reason why the said public authority has named an Information Officer

as well as a Designated Officer. If the Office of the Speaker of the Parliament is

a separate public authority, there should have been a separate Information

Page 16 of 17

Officer and a Designated Officer under the provisions of the RTI Act, where no

such appointments have been made. For all intended purposes, the Secretary

General of the Parliament is its Chief Executive Officer which is a position

protected by the Constitution. Although the Speaker of Parliament holds a

position above the Secretary General of the Parliament, both are positions

created within the Parliament of Sri Lanka and in accordance with the

Constitution.

As determined quite correctly by the Commission, the two positions should

function in conjunction with each other for the smooth functioning of the

Parliament of Sri Lanka, and in achieving the objectives of a Parliament in a

country.

Therefore, I am of the view that the Secretary General of the Parliament cannot

claim that he is independent and separate from the Office of the Speaker of the

Parliament, and hence, there cannot be any fictional arguments in that regard.

Under the circumstances, I find no basis to disagree with the determination of

the Commission that as a public authority, it is the Sri Lanka Parliament that is

in possession, custody or control of the information requested as envisaged in

section 3 (1) of the RTI Act. I am of the view that even if the declaration of assets

and liabilities by the Members of Parliament who are required to provide that

information should be with the Speaker of Parliament, there cannot be any

impediment to the Secretary General of the Parliament as the Chief Executive

Officer of the institution to inquire into and provide a list of the names as

requested by the respondent in terms of RTI Act, which in any way would not

amount to encroaching into the powers of the Speaker of the Parliament in my

view.

I find no basis for the submission that the Secretary General is not expected to

go on a voyage of discovery to provide the information required either, as the

respondent has requested an information available well within the parliament of

Sri Lanka.

Page 17 of 17

In accordance with the Regulation No 04 (08) of the regulations formulated under

the Right to Information Act No 12 of 2016 and published in Government Gazette

No-2004/66 dated 3rd February 2013 any public authority is required to utilize

its resources with a reasonable effort to provide the information available with

it. The relevant regulation, which is self-explanatory, reads thus;

Regulation No 04-

(8) A public authority shall not be required to collect information to

respond to a request on the ground that it does not hold the

information where, with a reasonable effort the information may be

produced from the records held by the public authority, using the

resources which is normally available to the public authority, or again

with a reasonable effort, the information may be complied from

different records held by the authority.

For the reasons set out above, I find no merit in any of the grounds of appeal

urged by the appellant.

The appeal therefore is dismissed. The Order dated 02-02-2021 of the Right to

Information Commission of Sri Lanka is affirmed.
