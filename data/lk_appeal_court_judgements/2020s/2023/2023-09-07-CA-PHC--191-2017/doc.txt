Page 3 of 12

It appears that when this matter was taken up for inquiry on 20.08.2014, the parties

explored the possibility of a settlement. Consequently, on 21.11.2014 parties reached a

settlement, and terms of settlement were entered accordingly by the Labour Tribunal.

According to the terms of settlement, Applicant was reinstated at the same salary scale with

effect from 01.12.2014 at the Ketandala Estate managed by the 2nd Respondent, and the

Applicant had agreed, not to claim salaries for the non-working period.

It was submitted by the Respondents that the applicant had failed to report for work as agreed

upon according to the terms of settlement entered on 22.12.2014.

Subsequently, Applicant sent a telegram to the Respondents and informed them that he would

report for work on 26.12.2014.

The Respondents had filed a motion on 28.02.2015 seeking to call the case in the Labour

Tribunal of Galle, since the applicant had suppressed and misrepresented the material facts

in respect of the settlement agreement.

However, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal refused to entertain the motion filed

by the Respondents by his order dated 09.07.2015.

Being aggrieved by the said Order Respondents had invoked the Revisionary Jurisdiction of

the Provincial High Court of the Southern Province holden in Galle.

It is seen that the Respondents filed the said motion dated 28.02.2015 before the Labour

Tribunal seeking to set aside the terms of settlement entered on 21.11.2014 on the basis that

the Applicant had joined an identical plantation company called Kelani Valley Plantation

PLC and also the Applicant was attached to Ganepalle Estate five months prior to the

application made to the Labour Tribunal by the applicant.

Therefore, the Respondents had contended that the Applicant had suppressed and

misrepresented material facts in entering into the aforesaid settlement.

The Learned Provincial High Court Judge, after hearing the application of the Respondents

by his order dated 07.11.2017 allowed the said revision application and set aside the Order

of the President of the Labour Tribunal dated 21.11.2014. The Learned Provincial High Court

Judge had further ordered to hold an inquiry to ascertain whether the Applicant was working

at the Kelani Valley Plantation PLC at the time of making the application to the Labour

Tribunal.

Page 4 of 12

Being aggrieved by the order of the learned Provincial High Court Judge the Applicant-

Respondent-Appellant [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant] had preferred

this appeal to the Court of Appeal.

When this matter came up before this court, Counsel for the Respondent-Petitioner-

Respondents [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Respondents] raised a preliminary

objection with regard to the maintainability of this appeal.

Accordingly, by way of a preliminary objection, Respondents challenged the Jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal to hear this case. The question raised by the Respondents is as follows,

Whether the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear and determine this appeal in

respect of the Industrial Dispute matters when an order was made by the Learned

High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Galle

The said preliminary objection has been raised by the Respondents with regard to the

maintainability of the revision application filed against the judgment pronounced by the

Provincial High Court exercising Civil Appellate Jurisdiction under Section 5 of the High

Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 as amended by Amending Act

No. 54 of 2006.

When the issue was raised before the court, both parties agreed to dispose of the preliminary

objection by way of written submissions.

Since this is a pure question of law regarding whether the Court of Appeals can hear and

determine an appeal emanating from the Provincial High Court exercising its revisionary

jurisdiction on a labour matter, I have analysed below the applicable law in detail.

The concept of Provincial High Courts was introduced by the 13th Amendment to the

Constitution under Article 154P of the Constitution [reproduced below].

Article 154P: (1) There shall be a High Court for each Province with effect from the

date on which this Chapter comes into force. Each such High Court shall be

designated as the High Court of the relevant Province.

(3) Every such High Court shall

(a) exercise according to law, the original criminal jurisdiction of the High

Court of Sri Lanka in respect of offences committed within the Province;

Page 5 of 12

(b) notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any law, exercise,

appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of convictions, sentences and

orders entered or imposed by Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within

the Province;

(c) exercise such other jurisdiction and powers as Parliament may, by law,

provide.

Furthermore, according to Article 156P(6),

(6) subject to the provisions of the Constitution and any law, any person aggrieved

by a final order, judgement or sentence of any such Court, in the exercise of its

jurisdiction under paragraphs (3)(b) or (3)(c) or (4) may appeal there from to the

Court of Appeal in accordance with Article 138.

Pursuant to Article 154P(6), appeals lie to the Court of Appeal from orders and judgments of

the Provincial High Court where it exercises appellate or revisionary jurisdiction against a

decision by the Magistrates Court, or Primary Court [Article 154P(3)(b)], or where the

Provincial High Court was exercising jurisdiction conferred by any law [Article 154P(3)(c)],

or where the Provincial High Court was exercising writ jurisdiction [Article 154P(4)].

The term any law in the above Articles also includes the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provision) Act No. 19 of 1990 (as amended) and the Industrial Disputes Act.

The appellate and revisionary jurisdiction on orders of the Labour Tribunal was vested with

the Provincial High Court by Section 3 [reproduced below] of the Act No. 19 of 1990 and by

Section 31D of the Industrial Disputes Act.

Section 3: A High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution for a Province

shall, subject to any law, exercise appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of

orders made by Labour Tribunals within that Province and orders made under section

5 or section 9 of the Agrarian Services Act, No. 58 of 1979, in respect of any land

situated within that Province.

It was the submission of the Appellant that under Article 154P(6) of the Constitution, the

Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal from the Provincial High

Court exercising its revisionary jurisdiction.

Page 6 of 12

On the contrary, the Respondents had submitted that Article 154P should be read with

provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended) as it is the most specific

law applicable in this respect.

Furthermore, the appeal procedure against judgments of the Labour Tribunal is given in the

Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended). As such, the Industrial Disputes Act

takes precedence over the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of

1990 as it is the more specific law by application of the maxim generalia specialibus non

derogant (the provisions of a general statute must yield to those of a special one).

The relevant provisions of the Act introduced by Amendment Act No. 32 of 1990 are analysed

below in order to understand the statutory framework introduced by the Industrial Disputes

Act.

Accordingly, Section 31D(3) [reproduced below] of the Industrial Disputes Act which is the

more specific law states that an appeal from the Labour Tribunal lies to the Provincial High

Court.

(3) Where the workman who, or the trade union which, makes an application to a

labour tribunal, or the employer to whom that application relates is dissatisfied with

that application relates is dissatisfied with the order of the tribunal on that application,

such workman, trade union or employer may, by written petition in which the other

party is mentioned as the respondent, appeal form that order on a question of law, to

the High Court established under Article 154P of the Constitution, for the Province

within which such labour tribunal is situated.

As such, an appeal from the Labour Tribunal lies to the Provincial High Court established

under Article 154P of the Constitution within the province within which such Labour

Tribunal is situated.

An appeal for an order/judgment given by such Provincial High Court lies directly to the

Supreme Court according to section 31DD(1) [reproduced below] of the Industrial Disputes

Act.

Section 31DD(1): Any workman, trade union or employer who is aggrieved by any

final order of a High Court established under Article 154P Of the Constitution, in the

exercise of the appellate jurisdiction vested in it by law or in the exercise of its

revisionary jurisdiction vested in it by law, in relation to an order of a labour tribunal,

Page 7 of 12

may appeal there from to the Supreme Court with the leave of the High Court or the

Supreme Court first had an obtained.

According to Section 31DD(2) [reproduced below], the Supreme Court has sole and exclusive

jurisdiction [emphasis added] over by way of an appeal over any order made by a Provincial

High Court. When read with section 31DD(1), it is apparent that the term any order

includes both orders made in revision and orders in appeals by the Provincial High Court.

Thus, it is evident that the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction over any order made by

the Provincial High Court, whether it be an order in a revision application or an order in an

appeal made by the Provincial High Court in terms of the provisions of the Industrial Disputes

Act.

(2) The Supreme Court shall, have sole and exclusive cognizance by way of appeal

from any order made by such High Court, in the exercise of the jurisdiction vested in

such High Court by subsection (3) of section 31D, and it may affirm, reverse or vary

any such order of such High Court and may issue such directions to any labour

tribunal or order a new trial or further hearing in any proceedings as the justice of

the ease may require and may also call for and admit fresh or additional evidence if

the interests of justice so demands and may in such event, direct that such evidence

be recorded by such High Court or any labour tribunal.

It was the contention of the Respondents that according to Section 31DD(1) of the Industrial

Disputes Act, an appeal against a judgment of the Provincial High Court lies directly to the

Supreme Court after obtaining leave first and that the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to

hear such appeals.

As noted above, it is clearly stated under section 31DD(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act that

appeal lies from the judgment of the Provincial High Court made in an appeal or a revision

application to the Supreme Court and that such jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is exclusive.

Thus, this court is of the opinion that in following a literal rule of interpretation, the

Industrial Disputes Act, being the specific law applicable has only allowed appeals from a

Provincial High Court to be filed directly before the Supreme Court after first obtaining leave

and that the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to hear such an appeal.

Following the literal rule of interpretation, one has to give effect to the plain meaning of the

words in the statue, as held by Lord Diplock in the case of Duport Steel v Stirs (19980) 1

WLR 142;

Page 8 of 12

"Where the meaning of the statutory words is plain and unambiguous it is not for the

judges to invent fancied ambiguities as an excuse to give effect to its plain meaning

because they consider the consequences of doing so would be inexpedient, or even

unjust or immoral."

This dictum by Lord Diplock has been cited in many Sri Lankan case law including, in the

case of Balasooriya Mudiyanselage Soorathunga Balasooriya v Saman Piyasiri and Others

(2012) CA (Writ) No. 342/2012 CAM 29.04.2019 by Justice A.H.M.D. Nawaz,

In Craies on Statute Law (7th Edition), Universal Law Publishing it is stated that:

Strictly speaking there is no place for interpretation or construction except

where the words of statute admit two meanings. As Scott LJ said: Where the

words of an Act of Parliament are clear, there is not room for applying any of

the principles of interpretation which are merely presumptions in cases of

ambiguity in the statute... The cardinal rule for the construction of an Act of

Parliament is that they should be construed according to the intention

expressed in the Act themselves.

As such, the intention of the legislature is quite clear from the plain meaning of the terms

stated in the Act, which is that any judgment/order made by the Provincial High Court under

the Industrial Disputes Act can only be canvassed before the Supreme Court by way of a leave

to appeal application.

A contrary interpretation of the above provisions was contended by the Respondents relying

on the case of Gunarathna v Thambiyagam 1993 2 SLR 355 where it was held that,

(1) The right of appeal is a statutory right and must be expressly created and granted

by statute.

(2) S. 9 of Act No. 19 of 1990 does not give a right of appeal to the Supreme Court

from an order of the High Court in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction.

It was the Respondents submission following the ratio in the above judgment that as Section

9 [reproduced below] of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provinces) Act No. 19 of

1990 has not provided for an appeal against a judgment given in revision by the Provincial

High Court to the Supreme Court and therefore, the Supreme Court has no such power to

hear such appeals, and thus the appeal should lie to the Court of Appeal.

Page 9 of 12

Section 9: Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other law, any person aggrieved

by (a) a final order, judgment, decree or sentence of a High Court established by

Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction vested in

it by paragraph (3) (b) of Article 154P of the Constitution or section 3 of this Act or

any other law, in any matter or proceeding whether civil or criminal which involves

a substantial question of law, may appeal there from to the Supreme Court if the High

Court grants leave to appeal to the Supreme Court ex mere moto or at the instance of

any aggrieved party to such matter or proceedings:

Provided that the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant special leave to appeal

to the Supreme Court from any final or interlocutory order, judgment, decree or

sentence made by such High Court, in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction vested

in it by paragraph (3) (b) of Article 154P of the Constitution or section 3 of this Act,

or any other law where such High Court has refused to grant leave to appeal to the

Supreme Court, or where in the opinion of the Supreme Court, the ease or matter is

fit for review by the Supreme Court:

Provided further that the Supreme Court shall grant leave to appeal in every matter

or proceeding in which it is satisfied that the question to be decided is of public or

general importance ; and (b) a final order, judgment or sentence of a High Court

established by Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of its jurisdiction

conferred on it by paragraph (3) (a), or (4) of Article154P of the Constitution may

appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal.

However, it is evident from section 31DD(1) and section 31DD(2) of the Industrial Disputes

Act that the right to appeal has been expressly given to the Supreme Court from any order

made by the Provincial High Court against an order/judgement from a Labour Tribunal

within the province. Furthermore, regardless of the interpretation of section 9 of the High

Court of the Provinces (Special Provinces) Act No. 19 of 1990, the specific Act that applies,

which is the Industrial Disputes Act, allows for an appeal from a revision application and has

clearly stated that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court on any order of the Provincial High

Court is exclusive [section 31DD(2)]. Therefore, it is evident that the exclusive jurisdiction

of the Supreme Court to hear appeals from any order made by a Provincial High Court under

the Industrial Disputes Act has not been considered in the above case.

Furthermore, the court in the above judgement has not considered the first line of section 9,

which clearly states that the provision applies Subject to the provisions of this Act or any

other law. Whereas any other law includes the Industrial Disputes Act, which has clearly

Page 10 of 12

provided for an appeal to the Supreme Court from a judgement/order given in a revision

application by the Provincial High Court.

It is noteworthy that a five-bench judgement of the Supreme Court in the case of

Bulathsinhala Arachchige Indrani Mallika V Bulathsinhala Arachchige Siriwardane of

Dummalasooriya, SC Appeal No 160/2016 [SC Minutes 02.12.2022] held that, judicial

precedent which is given in ignorance of the law should not be followed.

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J. stated the following in the said judgement [at 20],

Hence, a decision per incuriam is one given in ignorance or forgetfulness of the law

by way of statute or binding precedent, which, had it been considered, would have

led to a different decision

[]

In the name of certainty in law, which is the main objective to be achieved by the

doctrine of stare decisis, we must not perpetuate error. Justice Soza at page 410

[Ramanathan Chettiar v. Wickramarachchi and Others [1978-79] 2 Sri LR 395]

emphasises this in the following manner:

The doctrine of stare decisis is no doubt an indispensable foundation upon

which to decide what is the law and its application to individual cases. It

provides at least some degree of certainty upon which individuals can rely in

the conduct of their affairs as well as a basis for orderly development of legal

rules. Certainty in the law is no doubt very desirable because there is always

the danger of disturbing retrospectively the basis on which contracts,

settlements of property and fiscal arrangements have been entered into.

Further there is also the especial need for certainty as to the criminal law.

While the greatest weight must be given to these considerations, certainty

must not be achieved by perpetuating error or by insulating the law against

the currents of social change. When the precedent is plainly and admittedly

wrong, the obligation to follow ceases because then the judge has a greater

obligation to preserve the rule of law.

There cannot be any difficulty in understanding the underlying rationale: in

order to be a binding precedent, the judgment must be according to the law.

[at 38]

Page 11 of 12

Therefore, this court is not bound by a decision that was given almost 30 years ago in

ignorance of section 31DD(1) and (2) of the Industrial Disputes Act.

While I agree that the position in Gunarathna v Thambiyagam (supra) maybe tenable in

other instances of appeals against revision applications from the Provincial High Court, as

the Industrial Disputes Act has clearly stated the contrary in relation to appeals relating to

Labour matters, this court cannot follow a judgement which has been pronounced in

ignorance of section 31DD(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act.

Furthermore, in the case Duro Pipe (Private) Ltd v Hettige Pradeep Silva and 38 Others, CA

PHC 91/2015 [CAM 27.02.2017] an identical preliminary objection was raised regarding

the maintainability of an appeal in the Court of Appeal against a judgement/order of the

Provincial High Court in a labour matter, which was upheld by this Court. In the above case,

the L.T.B. Dehideniya J. [H.C.J. Madawala J. concurring] interpreted section 31DD of the

Industrial Disputes Act and held that,

The law is very clear that the appeal against an order of the Provincial High Court

does not lie in the Court of Appeal. It lies on the Supreme Court on leave being

obtained from the High Court or the Supreme Court.

It has been held by Andrew Somawansa J. (P CA) in the case of Sunil Jayawardana vs.

Puttalam Cement Company Limited CA (PHC) APN 265/2004 [CA Minutes dated

05.08.2005] held that; "1 am not at all in agreement with the aforesaid submissions

for the simple reason that the 13th amendment to the Constitution which grants

appellate powers against an order made in a High Court in an industrial dispute make

no provisions for granting appellate jurisdiction either by way of appeal or revision

to this Court. (Court of Appeal). 1 would say the preliminary objection raised by the

respondent applicant respondent is sustainable and far-reaching one cannot come to

this Court for redress when the relief lies elsewhere, and this Court cannot by

implication surmise or by conjecture assert itself with jurisdiction that has not been

granted in law. "

Therefore, it is clear that this court should not assert itself jurisdiction which has been left

exclusively and within the cognizance of the Supreme Court, any attempt to do so would not

only lead to a multitude of litigations on the same matter but may also result in confusion

regarding the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal.

Page 12 of 12

Having duly considered the foregoing, I hereby affirm the Respondent's preliminary objection,

leading to the dismissal of this appeal. Consequently, the Order issued by the Provincial High

Court of Southern Province holden in Galle dated07.11.2017 remains valid and in force.

Therefore, the Labour Tribunal is ordered to carry out an inquiry as instructed by the learned

Provincial High Court Judge of Southern Province holden in Galle with utmost haste

regarding whether the Applicant was working at the Kelani Valley Plantation PLC at the time

of making the application to the Labour Tribunal and to make an order on the validity of the

settlement agreement pursuant to such inquiry.

The Appeal is dismissed.
