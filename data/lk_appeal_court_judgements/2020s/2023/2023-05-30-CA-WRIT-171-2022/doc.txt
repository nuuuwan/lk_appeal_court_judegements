Argued on : 09.08.2022, 18.10.2022, 07.02.2023 and 22.02.2023

Written Submissions: Petitioner - 24.03.2023

Respondents- 09.05.2023

Decided on : 30.05.2023

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner primarily seeks for a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing

the decision of the Sri Lanka Customs to detain the consignment of goods in reference to

the CUSDEC No. 12970 when the said CUSDEC was submitted for clearance on

10.03.2022. In addition to the said relief, the Petitioner is seeking, inter alia, for a mandate

in the nature of a writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to release the goods

imported under the said CUSDEC No. 12970 and also for a writ of Prohibition restraining

the 1st Respondent holding a customs inquiry in relation to the said importation.

The Petitioner has entered into an agreement with the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka

('BOI') and the Petitioner has been registered as a BOI company pursuant to a certification

issued by BOI (6th Respondent) under and in terms of Section 17 of the Greater Colombo

Economic Commission Law No. 4 of 1978 ('BOI Law'). The Agreements entered into

between the Petitioner and the BOI are annexed as 'P3' to P5. The Petitioner states that

construction work of pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical manufacturing plants

Page 4 of 14

commenced in the year 2018 and accordingly, the Petitioner has obtained approval to

import related plants and machinery on duty free basis. The syrup, tablet and capsule

manufacturing plants were also included in the said project. Setting up of an EU GMP1

Cleanroom Compliant facility was supposed to be a part of the said manufacturing plant.

The Petitioner asserts that the BOI has granted approval to import equipment for a

complete Cleanroom under HS Code 8479.89.90 for which CESS is not applicable and

the respective consignment contained only the equipment essentials for the Cleanroom.

The allegation against the Petitioner was that the Petitioner had failed to declare 14 plastic

containers which do not fall within the above HS Code. Anyhow, the Petitioners

contention is that such items are storage devices to be kept in the stainless-steel cupboard

and the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents manifestly violating the agreements between the BOI

and the Petitioner have decided that the said consignment was subjected to CESS.

Referring to the letters, marked 'P23' to 'P25', the Petitioner states that the BOI has

informed Sri Lanka Customs that the contents of the subject consignment imported under

CUSDEC No. 12970 were part of the machinery of the manufacturing plant and its under

the classification of HS Code 8479.89.90.

The basic question which needs resolution in the instant Application is whether it is lawful

for Sri Lanka Customs to inquire into the classification of the subject goods imported by

the Petitioner when such goods have been already classified as HS Code 8479.89.90 by

the BOI. Similarly, it needs consideration whether Sri Lanka Customs could exercise

powers under Customs Ordinance in order to classify imported goods when such goods

have been imported in terms of an agreement with the BOI under Section 17 of the BOI

Law.

Regulations under BOI Law

The Greater Colombo Economic Commission Regulations No. 1 of 1978 have been

published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 8/2 on 31.10.1978 ('Gazette'). The Regulation

2(v) of the said Gazette implies that the Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance shall not

apply to any goods, wares and merchandise imported into Sri Lanka by virtue of an

agreement entered into between an enterprise and BOI under Section 17 of the BOI Law.

1 good manufacturing practice European Medicine Agency

Page 5 of 14

The said Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance deals with the duties of Customs and power

of Parliament to modify the duties.

The Respondents argue that the said Regulation 2(v) of the Gazette has no application to

Section 10(1A) to 10(1C) of the Customs Ordinance since the said Regulations were

promulgated in the year 1978 and the said Section 10(1A) to 10(1C) were introduced by

way of an amendment to the said Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance in the year 2013.

Whereas the Petitioner's contention is that in view of Regulation 2(v) of the said Gazette,

the Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance shall not apply to goods imported under an

agreement entered into with the BOI and no CESS is applicable for the HS Code

(8479.89.90) provided by BOI for the clearance of the good related to the said Cleanroom.

It is stated that as stipulated in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2202/6, marked 'P14'

published (on 17.11.2020) in terms of Export Development Act No. 40 of 1979, the CESS

is exempted for the goods under the above classification.

First, I must examine whether the Regulation 2(v) of the said Gazette is still in force amidst

the amendment introduced to Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance by Customs

(Amendment) Act No. 9 of 2013. By way of the said Amendment Act, Section 10(1A) to

Section 10(1C) are added immediately after Section 10(1) of the Customs Ordinance.

Hence, it is well noted that the Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance was amended only

by adding further provisions and no changes were made to the text of the Section 10(1).

The said Section 10(1) of the Customs Ordinance stipulates:- 'the several duties of customs,

as the same are respectively inserted, described, and set forth in figures in the table of duties

(Schedule A) shall be levied and paid upon all goods, wares, and merchandise imported

into or exported from Sri Lanka.' The proviso to that Section is spelt out in Section 10(1)(a)

to Section 10(1)(c). By the said amendment made to Section 10, new provisions have been

introduced to deal with a situation where there is a dispute relating to imposition or

exemption of customs duty on any goods, any condition or exception to the payment of

customs duty on any goods or clarification or description of the goods, imported into or

exported from Sri Lanka. In such a situation, the importer or exporter of such goods as

the case may be may make an application forthwith to the Director-General for

determination and the Director-General shall, within ninety days from the date of receipt

of such application determine any application made to him under subsection (1A).

Page 6 of 14

On perusal of the provisions of the Section 10(1) of the Customs Ordinance and also the

provisions added thereto by the said Amendment Act No. 9 of 2013, it implies that the

power of the Customs officials to levy duties has not been undermined by Sections 10(1A)

to 10(1C). The said Sections 10(1A) to 10(1C) only provide a mechanism to deal with a

situation where there is a dispute relating to the imposition or exemption of customs duty

as mentioned above. The said Regulation 2(v) which is a subordinate legislation stipulated

in the said Gazette has not been amended by way of a further regulation or by the said

Amendment Act No. 9 of 2013 or by any other written law.

It is necessary to bear in mind that the Regulations in the Gazette have been promulgated

not under the provisions of the Customs Ordinance but under the BOI Law. Similarly, the

Amendment Act No. 9 of 2013 is in respect of the Customs Ordinance. I am mindful of

the fact that the regulatory clause promulgated by the relevant minister freezes the

statutory clause enacted by Parliament to limit the operation of the provisions of the said

Section 10. Perhaps, the relevant minister when promulgating those Regulations has

referred only to the original Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance. However, neither the

Parliament nor the relevant minister referred to in the BOI Law, has given thought to

amend those Regulations in the Gazette, when enacting the said Amendment Act No. 9

of 2013. Hence, I have no option other than rejecting the proposition of the Respondents

that the application of Sections 10(1A) to 10(1C) of the Customs Ordinance has an

impediment for the operation of the said Regulation 2(v) of the Gazette.

Duty under Customs Ordinance vis--vis CESS

Now, I advert to examine whether CESS described in Sri Lanka Export Development Act

No. 40 of 1979 ('SLED Act') should be taken into consideration as a tax or a duty distinct

to duty referred to in Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance when Regulation 2(v) of the

said Gazette becomes operative. This is imperative since the Respondents allege that the

goods imported by the Petitioner under CUSDEC No. 12970 contained items upon which

the CESS should be imposed.

In terms of Section 14(1) of the said SLED Act there shall be charged, levied and paid a

cess at such rates as may be determined by the Minister from time to time, with the

concurrence of the Minister in charge of the subject of Finance, by Order published in the

Gazette, on such imports and exports specified in the Order. The Petitioner has submitted

Page 7 of 14

such Order made under the said Section 14, marked as 'P14'. The International Trade

Administration (Sri Lanka-Country Commercial Guide) website has stated that 'The

Export Development Board (EDB) levy, often referred to as a cess, ranges from 10

percent to 35 percent ad valorem on a range of imports identified as nonessential or as

competing with local industries.'

It is important to draw the attention to proviso to Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance

which declares that any customs duty leviable in terms of Section 10 of Customs

Ordinance shall not affect or be deemed to affect any royalty, cess or duty which is leviable

or payable on the importation or exportation of such goods under any other written law.

The Section 10(1)(c);

'Express reference in the said Schedule to any customs duty leviable on any goods

imported into or exported from Sri Lanka shall not affect or be deemed to affect

any royalty, cess or duty, by whatsoever name called, which is leviable or payable

on the importation or exportation of such goods under any written law other than

this Ordinance.' (Emphasis added)

This reflects the fact that the provisions of the said Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance

do not impede charging CESS separately, which is prescribed by the SLED Act which is

another written law other than the Customs Ordinance.

Whether CESS is leviable for goods under Agreements in terms of Section 17 of the BOI Law

Then the question arises whether the investors who enter into agreements with the BOI

under Section 17 of the said BOI Law are liable to pay CESS although they are exempted

from duties in terms of Regulation 2(v) of the said Gazette. As indicated above the said

Regulation 2(v) specifies that Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance would not apply to

such agreements. When the said Regulations expressly provide that Section 10 of the

Customs Ordinance is not applicable, the provisions in the said Section 10(1)(c) to the said

Section will also become inapplicable in that regard. However, the question remains

whether the levying of CESS will also be excluded with the operation of Regulation 2(v)

of the Gazette.

I am of the view that the mere non application of Section 10 as a result of Regulation 2(v)

would not warrant to read or understand those provisions of the said Section 10(1)(c) to

Page 8 of 14

give a negative effect to the substance of the said Section 10 and its proviso. The mandate

of Regulation 2(v) is only to spell out that the Section 10 shall not apply to the goods

mentioned in the said Regulation and it is a provision applicable only for specific

agreements signed with the BOI under the BOI Law. The Section 10 of the Customs

Ordinance is not a subordinate legislation and the intention of the legislature embodied in

Section 10, cannot be completely changed or discarded by misinterpreting the said

Regulation 2(v). Thus, non applicability of Section 10 will not affect the due operation of

Section 14(1) of the SLED Act. In other words, CESS can be levied even on an occasion

when Section 10 of the Ordinance is not applicable in respect of agreements under Section

17 of the BOI Law and moreover, the CESS should be identified as a tax distinct from

customs duties spelt out in the Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance.

This position is further elaborated by the provisions of Section 14(6) of the said SLED Act

which stipulates that the CESS imposed under the said Section shall be in addition to any

import duty or export duty or any other CESS levied under any other written law. Such

independent identity of CESS will not be affected even with the provisions of Section 14(4)

of the same Act.

Section 14(6) The cess imposed under this section shall be in addition to any

import duty or export duty or any other cess levied under any other

written law. (Emphasis added)

Section 14(4) This section shall have effect as though it formed part of the Customs

Ordinance, and the provisions of that Ordinance shall apply

accordingly.

In light of the above, I reject the hypothesis of the Petitioner that CESS cannot be levied

in respect of goods imported by virtue of agreements under Section 17 of the BOI Law.

The scope of the authority of Sri Lanka Customs over the goods imported in terms of an

agreement under Section 17 of the BOI Law.

The Petitioner's additional argument as per 'P14' is that the goods imported by the

Petitioner under CUSDEC No. 12970 do not fall into the specifications which warrants

CESS to be levied. It is obvious that CESS can be levied only in reference to the imports

and exports specified in an order issued by the relevant minister under Section 14 of the

Page 9 of 14

SLED Act. Then a pertinent question arises whether an investor who imports goods under

a BOI agreement would be liable to pay CESS for any imported goods fall under a

specification different to the specification prescribed & approved by the BOI. Both parties

of the instant Application made contrasting submissions on the competence of Sri Lanka

Customs to determine on specifications in respect of the goods imported under an

agreement entered into with BOI.

In this regard, the Petitioner highly relies on the judicial precedent enunciated in Ceylon

Quartz Industries (Private) Limited vs. The Director General of Customs, S.C. Appeal No.

79/2002 decided on 04.10.2012. At the outset, based on my earlier findings, I must

emphasize that the dicta of the said Judgement can be taken in to consideration when

analyzing the questions in the instant case. It is to be noted that the Respondents take a

contrary view upon an alleged basis that the said judgement has been delivered after the

said Amendment Act No. 9 of 2013. In the said judgement which discussed the control of

customs over the goods imported under an agreement entered into under Section 17 of the

BOI Law, Dr. Shirani A. Bandaranayake CJ. has stated;

As referred to earlier BOI was introduced and established chiefly for the purpose of attracting

investments within the country. With the said objective in mind various concessions were

offered for the investors. In this process the BOI was introduced as a One Stop Shop mainly

to indicate that there will not be any unnecessary hazzles in carrying out their business by the

investors. This position is clearly demonstrated by Clause 10 of the Agreement, which lists

out the benefits, exemptions and/or privileges that are granted to the Enterprises in

connection with the relevant businesses. In that, Sub Clause (ix), referred to earlier, clearly

stated that, all goods, articles, manufactured and/or produced by the Enterprises may be

exported outside Sri Lanka free of export duty and more importantly, any custom or export

control. The said Clause 10 (ix) also states that, the said goods produced by the Enterprises

should be in accordance with the agreements entered into by the said Enterprise with the

BOI.

The position therefore is quite clear. Business Enterprises were invited to enter into

agreements with the BOI offering different types of concessions for them. This included in

terms of Clouse 10 (ix) concession from export duty and any custom or export control. To

obtain such concessions, it would be necessary that the relevant goods and articles are

manufactured or produced in accordance with the Agreement. It is also necessary to refer to

Page 10 of 14

the provisions of Clause 10(ix). It provides for any Governmental authority to examine the

correctness of any declaration made. However this is subject to the condition that such

authority should be exercised in the manner as directed by none other than the BOI.

In the said case of Ceylon Quartz Industries (Private) Limited, the Court has noted that the

words 'concession from any custom or export control' were reflected in the respective BOI

agreement. However, no such strong provisions are embodied in the Agreement marked

P3 entered into between the Petitioner and the BOI in the instant case. It is observed that

several clauses of the said Agreement 'P3' tend to provide that all other taxes and levies in

respect of import of items other than the customs duty are payable as applicable.

Moreover, the Petitioner is not entitled to import items referred to in the Negative List as

enumerated in the Second Schedule thereto published by the Secretary to the Treasury. It

appears that the Petitioner (the Enterprise) shall be subject to all other laws, not referred

to in Schedule 'B' of the said BOI Law, save and except any exemptions and/or benefits

and/or privileges specifically granted to it by such other laws and/or orders and/or

regulations framed thereunder. Clause 16(iv) & Clause 16(vii) of 'P3' reads;

iv. 'All imports/local purchases of business relisted capital and construction items other than

the items in the Negative List published by the Secretary to the Treasury as may be

approved by the Board to be used for and by the Enterprise for the purpose of the business

shall be free of customs duty during the project implementation period of Thirty Six (36)

months from the date hereof. All other taxes and levies in respect of import of items other

than the customs duty are payable as applicable. Provided that this exemption shall not

apply to any personal effects imported by the Enterprise for the private and personal use

of any person in the Enterprise and provided that the Board reserves to itself the right to

cause or permit to be caused the examination of any import for purposes connected with

this Agreement.'

'Provided that the Enterprise shall not be entitled to import items referred to in the

Negative List as enumerated in the Second Schedule hereto, published by the Secretary

to the Treasury. However, any importation of items in the Negative List shall be

considered by the Board where such items are either not wholly manufactured in Sri

Lanka or are not available in sufficient quality, quantity and on time delivery to meet the

time line of project completion.'

Page 11 of 14

'Provided further, prior to import/purchases of any items on duty free basis as aforesaid,

the Enterprise shall obtain the prior written approval from the investment Appraised

Department of the Board.'

vii. 'The provisions of the laws set out in Schedule B of the said Law No. 4 of1978 which are

inconsistent with the benefits and/or exemptions and/or privileges set out in sub-clauses

(i) to (iv) above shall not be applicable to the Enterprise in relation to the business. The

Enterprise shall be subject to all other laws, not referred to in Schedule B of the said Law

No. 4 of 1978 save and except any exemptions and/or benefits and/or privileges

specifically granted to it by such other laws and/or orders and/or regulations framed

thereunder.'

Onril (Pvt.) Limited vs. The Director General of Customs, CA/Writ/760/2008 decided on

24.07.2013 is another judgement relied on by the Petitioner. The Court of Appeal in the

said case giving reference to the above Ceylon Quartz Industries (Private) Limited case has

carefully considered the consequences when an investor imports goods other than what

were permitted by BOI. Gooneratne J. referring to the question of lawful importation has

stated;

In all cases involving imports of goods, there is no doubt that the Customs Ordinance would

apply and any violation of those provisions has to be dealt according to law. What goes to the

root of the matter is the question of lawful importation. The Customs Ordinance is so designed

to cater to all kinds of violations and the burden would shift to the Petitioner to establish and

prove lawful importation. Even if the state is called upon to prove importation, the Petitioner

would not be relieved of the burden of proving lawful importation. A mere authority obtained

under another statute cannot be the final authority in cases involving import of goods/articles.

In terms of Sections 12, 43, 125 & 152 of the Customs Ordinance goods could be seized at any

point of time if same is illegally imported contrary to the above sections of the Customs

Ordinance. The degree of required proof had been discussed in 'Govindasamy's case 1980 (2)

SLR 278.

In the instant Application, the Respondents do not raise the issue of unlawful importation.

However, the issue referred to Court is whether the Petitioner has imported goods which

do not fall within the classification 'HS Code 8479.89.90'.

Page 12 of 14

Giving due consideration to both above judgements and in light of my above findings, I

take the view that an investor who imports goods under a BOI agreement would be liable

to pay CESS for any goods imported unless such goods are exempted from CESS by an

order of the relevant minister or it is expressly excluded in the BOI agreement with prior

approval. The CESS is a levy distinct to the Customs duties referred to in Section 10 of the

Customs Ordinance and further, the CESS is levied under a separate written law (SLED

Act) which is not excluded in terms of Section 17 of the Customs Ordinance. In such a

backdrop, an appropriate branch of the Government must have the authority to inquire

into related goods which are imported against the terms of such BOI agreements. The

Agreements entered into with BOI in the instant case do not illustrate any such exclusion

or exemption of CESS in favour of the Petitioner.

It is apparent that none of the Agreements entered into between the Petitioner and the BOI

exempt the Petitioner from paying CESS and it is the duty of the Petitioner to obtain prior

approval, if necessary, from relevant authorities in that regard.

Anyhow, the final question which arises here is whether Sri Lanka Customs has authority

to revisit the classification prescribed by the BOI. As per the decision of Dr. Shirani A.

Bandaranayake CJ. in the above Ceylon Quartz Industries (Private) Limited case, any

Governmental authority to examine the correctness of any declaration is subjected to the

condition that such authority should be exercised in the manner as directed by none other

than the BOI. It can be assumed on the strength of the above two judgements in Ceylon

Quartz Industries (Private) Limited and Onril (Pvt.) Limited cases that the Sri Lanka

Customs should have the power to use their authority under the Customs Ordinance when

an investor (who enters into an agreement with BOI) imports any goods different to the

prescribed specification or such investor engage in unlawful importation in violation of

the respective BOI agreements.

Most importantly it is observed that the issue on CESS is not involved in both the above

two judgements. The contention of the Petitioner is that the BOI has repeatedly informed

the Sri Lanka Customs that the consignment of goods in terms of CUSDEC No. 12970

were part and parcel of the essentials of the particular Cleanroom.

Page 13 of 14

The Petitioner drew the attention of this Court to the below paragraph of the letter

addressed to the Director of Customs by the Executive Director (Investor Services) on

24.04.2022 ('P25');

'As per the import Customs tariff under levy of customs duty (copy annexed), any

plant, machinery and equipment, if imported disassemble or unassembled for

convenient of packing, handling, transportation and presented in the same

consignment or imported in different consignments are to be classified as the

commodity resulting after the assembly.'

In line of the judicial precedent enunciated in the above two judgements, it seems that the

sole authority of deciding whether the items imported by the Petitioner fall within the HS

Code 8479.89.90 is with the BOI. However, it is a vital fact that the specialty of

determining the HS Code is vested in Sri Lanka Customs. At this juncture, I must draw

my attention to the judgement in T & J Pharma Imports (Pvt.) Limited, Millagahawatte,

Galthuda, Panadura vs. P. S. M. Charles, Director General of Customs and others,

CA/Writ/210/2018 decided on 16.11.2020, a case heavily relied on by the Respondents.

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J. held in the said judgement that;

I must say that this Court does not have the expertise to engage in the classification of a good

imported to the country, nor would it attempt to do so in the exercise of its Writ jurisdiction.

That expertise lies with Sri Lanka Customs, and its Nomenclature Committee, as well as

with the World Customs Organisation. In instances where Courts lack such expertise, Courts

would defer to the views of such expert bodies.

The BOI cannot have any control over levying of CESS since BOI has no power to grant

exemptions from any law which are not referred to in the Schedule B of the BOI Law. The

SLED Act is not in the list of written laws which are exempted in terms of the Section 17 of

the BOI Law. Anyhow, such exemption may be granted at the time of entering into an

agreement under the said Section 17 of the BOI Law with prior approval and according to law.

Interestingly, the goods imported under HS Code 8479.89.90 by any consignee other than an

investor under the said Section 17 is also exempted from CESS as the said HS Code is any

way not included in the order made by the minister under SLED Act. Therefore, I am not

inclined to accept the argument of the Petitioner that the Sri Lanka Customs has no

Page 14 of 14

authority to inquire into the correctness of the specifications for the purpose of levying

CESS in respect of the items which do not fall within the HS Code 8479.89.90.

Thus, I take the view that the Sri Lanka Customs has the authority to inquire into any

matter pertains to making an assessment whether the items imported by the Petitioner is a

partial shipment of EU GMP Cleanroom Compliant equipment and whether the

accessories imported in terms of CUSDEC No. 12970 are items which are liable to be

levied CESS.

Reliefs

In light of the foregoing and based on the special circumstances of this case, I am of the

view that the reliefs sought by the Petitioner for a mandate in the nature of a writ of

Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st to 5th Respondents to detain the consignment of

goods in terms of CUSDEC No. 12970 should be refused. The mandate in the nature of a

writ of Mandamus prayed for by the Petitioner will not arise at this stage as the subject

consignment of goods have already been released subject to certain conditions. Further, I

am not inclined, in view of my above reasons, to restrain the 1st Respondent holding an

inquiry in relation to CUSDEC No. 12970 by way of a writ of Prohibition. I clearly

observe that the process of finalizing the decision of Sri Lanka Customs in respect of the

issue on the respective HS Code in the instant Application is not completed and

accordingly, the Petitioner still has the opportunity to engage in an appeal process against

any final decision of the Sri Lanka Customs in this regard.

Thus, I proceed to dismiss the Application of the Petitioner. I order no costs.

Application is dismissed.
