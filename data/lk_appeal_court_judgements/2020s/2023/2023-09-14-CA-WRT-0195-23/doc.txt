Before: M. T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

S. U. B. KARALLIYADDE, J. Counsel: Shantha Jayawardane, with Ms. Hiranya Damunupola for the Petitioner. Ms. Yuresha Fernando, DSG., with Sehan Soysa, SC and Ms. Tashya Gajanayake for the Respondents. Supported on: 10.07.2023 Written Submissions on: 11.08.2023 by the Petitioners Decided on: 14.09.2023 MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. The General Manager of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), published in

Daily News newspaper on 30-03-2023, marked as P20, calling for

applications for vacancies as Electrical Engineers Class II Grade II and

Mechanical Engineers Class II Grade II on a contract basis for the

Lakvijaya Power Plant, Norochcholai. The contention of the learned

Counsel for the Petitioners is that the eligible criteria stipulated in P20 are

contrary to the eligible criteria set out in the Scheme of Recruitment and

Promotion-2002 (SOR=2002), applicable for different categories of services

of CEB with effect from 29-10-2002 which is marked and produced as P8.

In those circumstances, the Petitioners are seeking, inter-alia, a Writ of

Certiorari quashing the said document marked as P20 and a Writ of

Prohibition prohibiting the Respondents from recruiting Electrical

Engineers Class II Grade II and Mechanical Engineers Class II Grade II on

a contract basis for the Lakvijaya Power Plant, Norochcholai. Moreover,

the Petitioners are seeking interim reliefs as follows;

(i). An Interim Order suspending the operation of the decision of the 1st to

9th Respondents calling applications for Electrical Engineer Class II Grade

II and Mechanical Engineer Class II Grade II on a contract basis for the

Lakvijaya Power Plant, Norochcholai, as reflected in P20 until the final

determination of this Application.

(m). An Interim Order restraining the 1st to 9th Respondents from making

appointments based on the advertisement marked P20 until the final

determination of this Application.

(n). An Interim Order restraining the 1st to 9th Respondents from calling

for interviews any potential candidates who applied for vacancies

advertised in P20 until the final determination of this Application.

We heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioners in support of this

Application. We heard the learned Deputy Solicitor General on behalf of

the Respondents as well. Having scrutinized the Petition, affidavits,

documents, limited objection of the Respondents and submissions, ex-

facie, it appears to this Court that the eligible criteria stipulated in P20 are

contrary to the eligible criteria set out in the Scheme of Recruitment and

Promotion-2002 (SOR=2002), applicable for different categories of services

of CEB with effect from 29-10-2002, marked as P8. The learned DSG

contended that due to the urgent need of recruiting professionally qualified

Engineers for the smooth power supply to the country, the CEB approved

the recruitment of 10 Electrical Engineers and 9 Mechanical Engineers for

Page 5 of 6

the said power plant on a contract basis for a period of five years, and

accordingly, called for applications for the said posts by P20. In paragraph

5 (v) of the limited objections, the Respondents admitted that they could

not obtain approval from the Minister concerned. It appears to this Court

that there are no impediments for the CEB to recruit Engineers in

accordance with P8. The Respondents, in their limited objections, failed to

state a satisfactory reason for not complying with P8.

The Petitioners state that there are about 200 members of the 1st Petitioner

Union who are currently serving as Engineering Assistants and

Superintendents in CEB who have fulfilled the required qualifications in

terms of SOR 2002 (P8) to apply for vacancies of Class II Grade II of the

Engineering Service of CEB. These qualified internal employees have been

denied the right to apply for the vacancies advertised in P20. This Court is

mindful of the fact that the age limit is stipulated as below 35 years in P20

which is contrary to P8. Moreover, around 22 Engineering Assistants and

Superintendents, presently attached to the Lakvijaya Power Plant,

Norochcholai have also been denied their right to apply for the said posts

as the advertisement P20 is not in terms of P8. It is pertinent to note that

though these Engineers are going to be appointed for a period of five years,

at the end of the said period they can be made permanent as per P20,

which reads as follows;

The appointment will be on a contract basis for a period of five years.

Those who have successfully completed a continuous five-year

contract period will be considered for absorption to the permanent

Electrical/Mechanical Engineers of CEB.

The foregoing clause of P20 will cause material prejudice to the members

of the 1st Petitioner Union. In these respects, it appears to this Court that,

if the interim Orders are not issued, prejudice will be caused to those

employees.

In these circumstances, it is the considered view of this Court that this is

a fit and proper case to issue notices on the Respondents and to grant

interim Orders until the final determination of this Application.

Thus, the notices are issued on the Respondents and the Interim Orders

as prayed for in paragraphs (i), (m) and (n) of the prayers to the Petition

are issued until the final determination of this Application.
