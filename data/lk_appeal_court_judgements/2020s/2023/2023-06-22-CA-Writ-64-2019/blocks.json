This principle had been acknowledged by Courts in the case of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited v. Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya3. If the petitioner did not comply with the transfer order, she would be subject to disciplinary proceedings for non-compliance. Moreover, even, if it is assumed that the Petitioners application has become futile, futility alone is not a ground to deny relief. In the case of Mohan Lal v. Seneviratne4 His Lordship Samayawardhena J., sitting in Court of Appeal (as His Lordship then was) observed that even in an application where relief had been granted whilst it is pending, the Court could make a finding and award costs of the action at least to send a message to the other public officers not to be swayed by extraneous factors in discharging their professional duties. In the case of Sudarkaran v. Bharathi5, the Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal, quashed the decision of the Respondents, and ordered a rehearing, although the renewal of the license for the year in question had expired.",
