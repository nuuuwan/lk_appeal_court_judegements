Judgment

The Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station-Kandy had filed an information in the Additional

Magistrates Court of Kandy in case bearing No. 55160 in terms of Section 66(1) (a) of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, with regard to a roadway which had been used

by the 1st Respondent and had been obstructed by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents.

It is seen that the learned Additional Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge

had taken all necessary steps stipulated in the Primary Courts Procedure Act. After the

conclusion of the inquiry, the learned Additional Magistrate had made an Order on the 24th of

January 2013 and held that 1st and 2nd Respondents were not entitled to have a servitudanal

right of way over the land of 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the 1st Respondent-Petitioner had invoked the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Kandy. It appears that the learned High Court Judge

had observed the learned Additional Magistrate had correctly identified the dispute amongst

parties as one relating to a roadway, which comes within the purview of Section 69(1) of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act.

Upon the evidence placed before the learned Additional Magistrate, it was revealed that the

1st Respondent-Petitioner is a licensee of 3rd, 4th, 5th Respondents and had been living in the

back yard of the land owned by the said Respondents with a separate access through Sri

Dhammadhassi Mawatha. Apparently, the dispute has arisen among the parties as the 3rd, 4th,

and 5th Respondents had put up a gate to the entrance of their land to protect and safeguard

the property from being used by strangers.

As such, it is observable that the learned Additional Magistrate had come to the correct finding

of facts and law and held with the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents determining that 1st and 2nd

Respondents are not entitled to a servitudanal right of way over the disputed road way across

the land owned by the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents.

In this respect, it is worthy to note the case of Ananda Sarath Paranagama vs

Dhammadhinna Sarath Paranagama and Kavitha Asmin Paranagama [CA PHC APN

117/2013] where Salam, J. emphasized:

A party does not need to establish a servitudanal right by cogent evidence as is usually

considered in a civil court. The required proof of the users right in terms of section

69(1) of the Act, is to consider a right in the nature of a servitude or long-term use.

It is noteworthy that the learned High Court Judge affirmed the said Order of the learned

Additional Magistrate and dismissed the revision application filed by the 1st Respondent-

Petitioner-Appellant on the ground that no exceptional circumstances warrant to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court seeking to set aside the Order of the learned

Additional Magistrate.

In this respect Court draws the attention to the decision in the case Nandawathie vs.

Mahindasena [2009] 2 SLR 218 which held;

When an Order of a Primary Court Judge is challenged by way of revision in the

Provincial High Court, the High Court can examine only the legality of that Order and

not the correction of that Order.

Moreover, by operation of law, right of appeal is conferred against an Order of the High Court

exercising its revisionary jurisdiction, such appeal in the circumstances could not be

considered as an appeal in true sense, but in fact the application could be considered to

examine the correctness, legality or the propriety of the Order made by the learned High

Court Judge in the exercise of revisionary powers.

It was emphasized by Ranjit Silva, J. in the said case Nandawathie Vs. Mahindasena [supra]

that;

Court of Appeal should not under the guise of an appeal attempt to rehear or re-

evaluate the evidence led in the main case.

As such, we are of the view that the task before this court is not to consider an appeal against

the Magistrates Court Order but to consider an appeal in which an Order pronounced by the

Provincial High Court in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction is sought be impugned.

Page 5 of 5

It was the main contention of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents that the 1st Respondent-

Petitioner-Appellant had failed to comply with the Supreme Court Rules and that the 1st

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant had not shown the existence of exceptional circumstances

to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court to revise or set aside the

Order of the learned Additional Magistrate made under Section 69(1) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act.

In the case of Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd Vs. Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd [1987] 1 SLR 5

it was held that it is settled law the exercise of revisionary powers of the Appellate Court is

confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist warranting its intervention.

Furthermore, it has been observed in superior court decisions that superior courts have always

declined to entertain revision applications when exceptional circumstances have not been

averred in those applications.

It is imperative to note that the learned High Court Judge held the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant had not satisfied court that exceptional circumstances exist to exercise the

revisionary powers of court.

Hence, the learned High Court Judge has judiciously dismissed the revision application made

by the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant. Thus, we see no reason for us to interfere with

the said dismissal of the application.

Thus, this appeal is dismissed with tax cost.
