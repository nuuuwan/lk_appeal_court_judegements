B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

In terms of Section 11A (2) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act No. 23 of 2011 as

amended (hereinafter referred to as TAC Act) the Case stated was transmitted to this

Court by the Secretary to the Tax Appeals Commission by letter dated 06.11.2015.

It contained the following thirty questions of law:

3

1. Is the purported of the Secretary to the Tax Appeals Commission (hereinafter

also referred as the Secretary), not fixing the appeal for hearing, erroneous,

invalid and bad in law, particularly because, the only statutory function specified

for the Secretary under Section 9(1) of the TAC Act, is to fix the appeal for

hearing on receipt of such appeal by the Secretary?

2. Has the Secretary misunderstood, misconstrued and erred in law, by refusing to

list the appeal for hearing, particularly because there is no provision in the TAC

Act for the Secretary to refuse and not to accept an appeal made to the

Commission?

3. Is the purported decision of the Secretary of not listing the appeal, erroneous,

invalid and bad in law as the Secretary, when refusing to list the appeal for

hearing has not stated the provision (Section) of the Statute under which the said

refusal to list the appeal was exercised and thus, violated the established legal

principle that the exercise of power should be referable to a valid jurisdiction?

4. Has the Secretary violated one of the principles of natural justice, the rule of

Audi alteram partem (The right to a fair hearing hear the other side), by not

providing a hearing to the Company before the Commission before refusing to

list the appeal, especially when otters, by its letters dated 19th September 2013

and 17th October 2013, has requested the Commission to grant an

opportunity/appointment to make the necessary clarification?

5. Is the Secretary empowered by law to dispose an appeal without giving a hearing

for the Appellant?

6. Has the Secretary misunderstood, misconstrued and erred in law, by refusing to

list the appeal for hearing, particularly because Otters has complied with the

requirement of proviso to Section 7(1) of the TAC Act, as it has paid

Rs.5,579,822/- as VAT and said amount of Rs. 5,579,822 paid as VAT is in excess

of 10% of the sum as assessed by the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue(which amount to Rs. 35,242,757/-, as stated in the letter dated 25th

January 2015 issued by the Department of Inland Revenue and which was

communicated to the Commission by the letter dated 5th January 2015. The 10%

4

of Rs. 35,242,757/-) is Rs. 3,524,277/-) and thus, the refusal by the Secretary to

list the appeal for hearing by the Commission in erroneous, invalid and bad law?

7. Has the Secretary acted unfairly, unjustly and unreasonably, by refusing to list

the appeal, after the Department of Inland Revenue, by its letter dated 05th

February 2015 has clarified to the Commission that otters had paid Rs.

5,579,822/- as VAT, which is in excess of 10% of the sum as assessed by the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue in the determination, in response to

the letter dated 15th February 2013, issued secretary to the Commission?

8. Is the decision of the Secretary, not listing the appeal for hearing erroneous,

invalid and bad in law, as the Secretary has not given any reasons whatsoever

as to the shortfall or inadequacy of the amount paid by Otters in compliance with

proviso to Section 7 (1) of the TAC Act?

9. Has the Secretary misunderstood, misconstrued and erred in law, by seeking the

direction of the TAC for not listing the appeal, when there is no provision in the

TAC Act for the Secretary to seek such a direction?

10. Has the Secretary erred by wrongly stating in her purported letter dated 12th

February 2015 (by an error, it has been stated as 12th February 2013), that the

Commission has sought he views of the Commissioner General, particularly

because Otters has sent its letter on 10th February 2015 and the Secretary has

responded by her purported letter dated 12th February 2015 (by an error, it has

been stated as 12th February 2013) ?

11. Was there no validity constituted Commission which could have taken a decision,

when the purported letter dated 12th February 2015 (by an error it has been stated

as 12th February 2013) sent by the Secretary to the Commission and therefore, is

the purported letter dated 12th February 2015 (by an error, it has been stated as

12th February 2013) bad in law and invalid and void ab initio?

12. Is the purported decision of the Commission, by not allowing the Secretary to

list the appeal, erroneous, invalid and bad in law, particularly because, the only

statutory function specified for the Secretary under Section 9(1) of the TAC Act,

5

is to list an appeal for hearing on receipt of such appeal by the Secretary?

13. Has the Commission misunderstood, misconstrued and erred in law, by refusing

to list the appeal for hearing, particularly as there is no provision in the TAC Act

for the Commission to refuse and not to accept made to the Commission?

14. Is the purported decision of the Commission of not listing the appeal, erroneous,

invalid and bad in law, as the Commission, when refusing to the list the appeal

for hearing has not stated the provision (Section) of the Statute under which the

said refusal to list the appeal was exercised and thus, violated the established

legal principle that the exercise of power should be referable to a valid

jurisdiction?

15. Has the Commission violated one of the principle of natural justice, the rule

Audi alteram partem The right to a fair hearing hear the other side), by not

providing a hearing to the Otters before refusing to list the appeal made by the

Otters, by its letters dated 19th September 2013 and 17th October 2013, has

requested the Commission to grant an opportunity/appointment to make the

necessary clarification?

16. Is the Commission empowered by law to dispose an appeal without giving a

hearing for the Appellant, particularly where in terms of Section 2 of the TAC

Act, the Commission is charged with the responsibility of hearing all the appeals

and in terms of Section 10 of the TAC Act, the Commission shall hear all the

appeals received by it?

17. Has the Commission misunderstood, misconstrued and erred in law, by refusing

to list the appeal for hearing, particularly because Otters has complied with

requirement of proviso to Section 7(1) of the TAC Act, as it has paid

Rs.5,579,822/- paid as VAT and said amount of Rs. 5,579,822/- paid as VAT is in

excess of 10% of the sum as assessed by the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (which amounts to Rs. 35, 242,757/-, as stated in the letter dated 25th

January 2015 issued by the Department of Inland Revenue and which was

communicated to the Commission by the letter dated 5th February 2015. The 10%

of Rs. 35,242,757/- is Rs. 3,524,277/-) and thus the refusal by the Commission to

6

list the appeal for hearing is erroneous, invalid bad in law.?

18. Has the Commission acted unfairly, unjustly and unreasonably, by refusing to

list the appeal, after the Department of Inland Revenue, by its letter dated 5th

February 2015 has clarified to the Commission that Otters had paid Rs.

5,579,822/- as VAT, which is in excess 10% of the sum as assessed by the

commissioner General of Inland Revenue in the determination, in response to

the letter dated 15th July 2013, issued by the Secretary to the Commission

19. Is the purported decision of the Commission, for not listing the appeal for hearing

erroneous, invalid and bad in law, as the Commission has not given any reasons

whatsoever as to the shortfall or inadequacy of the amount paid by Otters in

compliance with proviso to Section 7 (1) of the TAC Act?

20. Has the Commission misunderstood, misconstrued and erred in law, by directing

the Secretary not to list the appeal, when there is no provision in the TAC Act to

provide such a direction to the Secretary?

21. Is the purported decision communicated in the purported letter dated 12th

February 2015 (by an error, it has been stated as 12th February 2013) bad in law

and null and void and illegal inasmuch as it stipulates that the views of the

Commissioner-General of Inland revenue have been sought and obtained and the

purported decision is based on such view wherein the commission was not

entitled by law and was not proper and was not in order to obtain such view from

the Commissioner-General of Inland revenue inasmuch as the Commissioner

General of Inland revenue is a party to the appeal?

22. Did the Commissioner err in law in obtaining the views of the Commissioner-

General of Inland Revenue who is a party to this action and thereby failed to take

an independent decision?

23. Did the Commission err in law to comply with the principles of natural justice in

that it fail to give a hearing on the request for listing and/or on the observation made

by the Commissioner-General of inland Revenue and thus. The purported decision

7

communicated in the purported letter dated 12th February 2015 9by an error, it has

been stated as 12th February 20130 is null and void and illegal and a nullity?

24. Is the purported decision made by the Commission, by its purported letter dated

12th February 2015 (by an error, it has been stated as 12th February 2013), in

refusing to list the appeal for hearing, is without a vail jurisdiction, as the said

purported decision to refuse to list the appeal was made in the absence of the

chairman?

25. Was the Commission not entitled to function or take decision without a Chairman

of the Commission?

26. Was there no validity constituted Commission at about the 12th February 2015?

27. Has the Otters complied with proviso to section 7 (1) of the TAC Act as it has

paid Rs. 5,579,822/- as VAT and the said Rs. 5,579,822/- paid as VAT is in excess

of 10% of the sum as assessed by the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue

in the determination (The sum assessed by the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue in the determination is 35,242,7527/-. The 10% od Rs. 35242,757/- is Rs.

3, 524,277-) ?

28. Has the Commission and/ or the Secretary wrongfully, unlawfully, unfairly and

unjustly denied the right of appeal of the Otters by not listing the appeal for

hearing?

29. Once the Appeal is lodged to the Commission, should not the validity or the

legality or the maintainability of the said appeal be determined, only by the

Commission at a hearing before the Commission?

30. Should the court of Appeal set aside the purported decision to refuse to list the

appeal and allow the appeal made by Otters to the Commission?

The main grievance of the Appellant is that the Petition of Appeal which was filed to

the Tax Appeals Commission was rejected by the Secretary to the Commission (not by the

Commission) without giving a hearing to the Appellant.

8

The said rejection was informed by the Secretary to the Commission by letter dated

12th February 2015. (The said letter by an error it has been stated as 12.02.2013)

The contents of the letter read as follows;

1. I am directed by the Tax Appeals Commission to inform you that subsequent to a

study of your application for re-listing, the Tax Appeals Commission after seeking

the views of the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue had decided not to allow

your application for re-list.

2. The decision to reject your application was made by the previous Commission.

Therefore, I am instructed to inform you to make an appropriate application to the

Court of Appeal.

The Respondent has in its written and oral submissions taken a preliminary objection

as to the jurisdiction of this Court. It was submitted that where an appeal has not been

entertained by the Commission, the Case Stated procedure cannot be availed of. The correct

procedure in its opinion is to challenge by way of judicial review in terms of Article 140 of the

Constitution.

I am unable to agree with the objection raised by the Respondent for the simple reason

that according to the Section 11A (6) of the TAC Act this Court is cloaked with the jurisdiction

when it is obliged to give an opinion on any question of law arising on the Case Stated

remitted by the Commission.

This Court has to consider who has to take decisions with regard to the accepting or

rejecting of the appeal as per the provision in Section 11A (2) of the TAC Act.

For the purpose of convenience Section 11A (2) of the TAC Act is reproduced below;

The case stated by the Commission shall set out the facts, the decision of the

Commission, and the amount of the tax in dispute where such amount exceeds five thousand

rupees, and the party requiring the Commission to state such case shall transmit such case,

when stated and signed to the Court of Appeal, within fourteen days after receiving the same.

[emphasis added]

I am unable to find any provision in the TAC Act which contemplates or makes

provisions for the Secretary to take decisions with regard to an appeal. On the other hand,

9

there is a provision in the said Act concerning the hearing and determination of an appeal

tendered by an aggrieved party. That is Section 8(3) of the said Act. It is pertinent to observe

that Section which reads as follows:

The manner and the form of submitting such appeal, the procedure to be followed by

the Commission in the hearing and determining of such appeal and the fees if any in respect

thereof shall be determined by the Commission by rules made, from time to time, in that

behalf.

On the other hand, the only provision of the said Act which provides for the functions

of the Secretary is Section 9 (1) of the said Act. According to that Section, the Secretary shall

.within thirty days of the receipt of an appeal.. fix a date and time and place for the

hearing of the appeal. Hence there is no authority conferred on the Secretary by this

Act to take decisions with regard to the acceptance or rejection of appeals.

At this juncture, this Courts attention is drawn to the statutory provision which

provides the criteria for the appointment of the members of the Tax Appeals Commission.

Section 2 of the TAC Act states as follows:

(1)

(2) The Commission shall comprise not more than nine members three of whom shall be

appointed from amongst retired Judges of the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal

and six other members from amongst persons who have wide knowledge of, and have

gained eminence in the fields of Taxation, Finance and Law, by the Minister to whom

the subject of Finance is assigned. One of the members shall be appointed as the

Chairman of the Commission by the Minister.

(2A)The Chairman of the Commission shall constitute three panels comprising

three members each, from among the members appointed under subsection

one of whom shall be a Judge as specified in subsection (2) to hear and

determine any matter before the Commission.

(3)

(4)

10

It is evident that Parliament has in its wisdom intended the members of the

Commission to not only have acquired wide knowledge in the relevant fields but also to be

of such calibre to have gained eminence in the said fields.

I wish to reproduce the observation made by the Hon. Mr Justice Popplewell in P v. Q

[2017 EWCH 194 (Comm) at para 68]

..The danger may be greater with arbitrators who have no judicial training or

background, than with judges who are used to reaching entirely independent adjudicatory

decisions with the benefit of law clerks or other junior judicial assistants. However, the danger

exists for all tribunals. Best practice is therefore to avoid involving a tribunal secretary in

anything which could be characterised as expressing a view on the substance of that which

the tribunal is called upon to decide.

It is noteworthy to consider the judgment of His Lordship Justice Malalgoda in Anoma

S.Polwatte v.Jayawickrama& Others [SC/Writ Application No. 1/2011 (Decided on

26.07.2018)] where his Lordship has considered the powers and functions of the Commission

to Investigate Bribery and Corruption. According to Section 3 of Bribery Act, it is the

Commission that directs the institution of proceedings. The question considered in this case

was whether such a direction given by one of the members of the Commission is lawful.

His Lordship held;

Thus it is clear that the members of the Commission can exercise ancillary powers on

his own though the full complement of the Commission is not available at one given time. But

as for the exercise of functions such as the direction to be given to the Director General, it is

crystal clear that the Act has not provided for one member alone to give such direction.

Similar provision with regard to filing of an appeal is found in Section 755(5) of the

Civil Procedure Code. In the said Section the proviso reads as follows.

Provided that when the Judge of the original court has expressed an opinion that there

is no right of appeal against the judgment or decree appealed against, the Registrar shall

submit the petition of appeal to the President of the Court of Appeal or any other Judge

nominated by the President of the Court of Appeal who shall require the petition to be

supported in open court by the petitioner or an attorney on his behalf on a day to be fixed by

such Judge, and the court having heard the petitioner or his attorney, may, reject such

11

petition or fix a date for the hearing of the petition, and order notice thereafter to be issued

on the respondents;

In Dharmaratne v. Kumari[2005] 1 SLR 265 His Lordship Justice Wimalachandra

held that the District Judge has no power to reject a notice of appeal even though he may

call upon the Appellant to rectify any defect in the notice of appeal. The District Judges

function is merely to forward the notice of appeal and the petition of appeal to the Court of

Appeal.

This Court is of the opinion that the proviso to Section 7 (1) TAC Act, which requiring

to furnish security, confers a discretion only on the Tax Appeals Commission.

Now this Court will consider the purpose of furnishing security under Section 7 (1) of

the TAC Act.

Proviso to Section 7 (1) is reproduced as follows;

Provided that, every person who wishes to appeal to the Commission under paragraph

(a) shall, at the time of making of such appeal, be required to pay into a special account which

shall be opened and operated by the Commission for such purpose, an amount-

a) as is equivalent to ten per centum which is non- refundable; or

b) as is equivalent to twenty five per centum which is refundable subject to subsection

(1A) of this Section or a bank guarantee for the equivalent amount which shall

remain valid until the appeal is determined by the Commission.

There is no dispute when the Appellant lodged the appeal to the Tax Appeals

Commission, the Appellant has informed that there was no need to make a fresh deposit as

there was a tax credit which is more than 25 percent of the determination of the Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue as required by the said section.

The object of requiring security is to avoid frivolous and vexatious appeals as well as

to ensure that once an appeal is concluded those moneys are readily available to the

Department of Inland Revenue. It should be noted that the said Section was introduced by

Act No. 20 of 2013 to ensure the money can be recovered.

12

His Lordship Justice Mark Fernando in Sri Lanka General Workers Union v.

Samaranayake [1996] 2 SLR 268 at 272 expressed a similar view. Referring to Section 31 D

(6) of Industrial Disputes Act, as amended, His Lordship held,

There can be doubt that the legislative intention was to ensure that at the conclusion

of the appellate proceedings, however lengthy, there would be a fund available to satisfy the

workmans entitlements; and, by providing for interest, to ensure that the lapse of time and

inflation would not unduly erode those entitlements

In Nanayakkara v. Warnakulasuriya. 1993 (2)SLR289 at 294 His Lordship Justice

Kulatunga made the following observation.

I wish to make an observation. Even though the District Court appears to have

no power to reject a notice of appeal for failure to hypothecate security, it may perhaps

call upon the appellant to rectify the defect where the non-compliance is observed at the

stage when notice of appeal is given.

Therefore, the purpose of furnishing the said security is to ensure that the money is

readily available to be recovered at the conclusion of the appeal.

Be that as it may, if Court presumes that the Commission directed the Secretary to

inform the Appellant of the rejection of its appeal on the basis of non-compliance with Section

7 of the TAC Act the question arises whether the non -compliance of that Section is

mandatory or directory? It should be noted that the TAC Act does not specify any penal

consequences for non-compliance of the provisions of Section 7.

Whether a provision is mandatory or directory was discussed in the following cases.

Justice G.P.A.Silva,J (as he then was) held in Rajen Philip v. Commissioner of Inland

Revenue (CA No. 1174/81 Sri Lanka Tax Cases Vol.IV P. 211)

What, then, is the test to determine whether a statutory provision is mandatory, and

what is the test to determine whether disregard of such a provision has the effect of nullifying

a decision taken in disregard of such statutory provisions? Under the heading disregard of

procedural and formal requirements . S.A. de Smith suggests the following test:-

13

When Parliament prescribes the manner or form in which a duty is to be performed,

it seldom lays down what will be the legal consequences of failure to observe its prescriptions:

The Courts must therefore formulate their own criteria for determining whether the

procedural rules are to be regarded as mandatory, in which case disobedience will render void

or voidable what has been done, or as .directory, in which case disobedience will be treated as

an irregularity not affecting the validity of what has been done. Judges have often stressed

the impracticability of specifying exact rules for the assignment of a procedural provision to

the appropriate category. The whole scope and purpose of the enactment must be considered,

and one must assess the importance of the provision that has been disregarded, and the

relation of that provision to the general object intended to be secured by the Act'. Judicial

Review of Administrative Action (4th Ed) 142.

When we perused the Section in the light of the above judicial dictums there is no

provision providing for penal consequences for failure to comply with the provision of the said

Section. Therefore, we hold that the provision of this Section is directory. In fact, it was

submitted in open court by the Counsel for the Appellant that the sum of money demanded

by the Commission had been furnished subsequently.

Further, I wish to mention that Our Courts have adopted liberal attitudes with regard

to the Tax laws.

In Nanayakkara v. University of Peradeniya [1991] (1) SLR 97, S.N. Silva,J, (as he

then was)held that;

The Stamp Duty Act imposes a pecuniary burden on the people. Therefore it is subject

to the rule of strict construction. (Maxwell on interpretation of statutes., 12th Edition page

256). In the case of Cape Brandy Syndicate vs. I.R.C, Rowlatt J stated as follows:

In a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly said. There is no room for

any intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There is no presumption as to a tax. Nothing

is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. One can only look fairly at the language used.

In Vallibel Lanka (Pvt.) Limited v. Director General of Customs and three others, [2008] 1 SLR 219 Sripavan J. (as he then was) held;

14

It is the established rule in the interpretation of statutes that levy taxes and duties,

not to extend the provisions of the statute by implication, beyond the clear import of the

language used or to enlarge their operation in order to embrace matters not specifically

pointed out. In case of doubt, the provisions are construed most strongly against the state and

in favour of the citizen.

The court cannot give a wider interpretation to Section 16 [of the Customs

Ordinance]. merely because some financial loss may in certain circumstances be

caused to the state. Considerations of hardship, injustice or anomalies do not play any useful

role in construing fiscal statutes.

The primary objection raised by the appellant was that the application for re-listing

was not rejected by the Tax Appeals Commission, but rather on the advice of the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue. In other words, the appellant was not heard by the

Tax Appeals Commission. We hold that the principles of natural justice were violated in this

regard. A plain reading of the said letter indicates that this matter was not referred to the

Commission to decide whether to accept or refuse the re-listing of the appeal. We hold that

the secretary to the Tax Appeals Commission possesses no power, jurisdiction, or authority to

reject the petition of appeal. The Tax Appeals Commission Act mandates the Tax Appeals

Commission to make decisions.

For the foregoing reasons, the opinion of this Court is that all questions of law raised

in this case should be answered in favour of the Appellant.

Therefore, this Court directs the Registrar to send this case back to the Tax Appeals

Commission for them to hear and determine this appeal, according to the provisions of law.
