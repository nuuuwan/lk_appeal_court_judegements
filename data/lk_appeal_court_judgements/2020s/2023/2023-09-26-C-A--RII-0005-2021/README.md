This is a petition of revision /restitutio in integrum submitted before this Court by the

4th defendant-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) pleading to revise and

restore the rights of the parties prior to the delivery of the impugned order dated

08.08.2017, delivered by the learned District Court Judge of Horana.

The facts of the case are as follows. This is a partition action instituted on or about

01.12.2008 in order to partition the land named Jayasuriyage Watta. The plaintiffs in

4

CA-RII-05-21 Page 4 of 10 26/09/2023 IJ-27-23

their averred that the 4th and 5th defendants were entitled to 30/600 undivided shares

from the corpus sought to be partitioned and furthermore that the 4th and 5th defendants

are entitled to 1/20 shares of the corpus by virtue of Deed of Gift bearing no.6686 dated

16.07.1989.

Subsequently, the corpus sought to be partitioned was surveyed and the preliminary

plan was prepared accordingly. Thereafter, the Statements of Claim were filed on behalf

of the 4th and the 5th defendants, following which the trial commenced on 01.07.2014.

On this day four issues were raised on behalf of the plaintiffs and a fifth issue was raised

on behalf of the 4th and the 5th defendants.

Furthermore, when the above matter was further taken up for trial on 20.11.2014, the

parties did not contest the issues and the issues raised on behalf of the plaintiffs and

4th and the 5th defendants, hence they were not required to be answered. The evidence

of the 5th defendant was led on 01.10.2015 and it remained unchallenged. Therefore,

the 5th defendant testified in Court with regards to the rights of Jayasuriya Arachchige

Jayathissa (2nd Defendant) which had devolved on the 5th defendant by virtue of Deed of

Transfer bearing no.14610 dated 20.08.1995 and that Jayasuriya Arachchige Somasiri

who had become entitled to an undivided 1/5 share of the corpus had transferred a

strip of land which was 3 feet in width to the 5th defendant by virtue of Deed of Transfer

bearing no.12649 dated 12.08.1995 so that the said strip of land would be connected

to the roadway which was situated within the land possessed by the 5th defendant, giving

him access to the land.

However, the trial was concluded on 10.03.2016 after evidence was led on behalf of the

plaintiffs,1st defendant and 4th & 5th defendants, and thereafter, the learned District

Judge of Horana delivered the judgment on 08.08.2017 allotting only an undivided 1/20

shares (30/600) from the corpus to the 4th and the 5th defendants.

The 5th defendant who was dissatisfied with the above judgment delivered by the learned

District Court Judge of Horana, filed a notice of appeal where it was averred that the

learned District Judge has failed to take into consideration that the 5th defendant is

further entitled to 1/15 share of the corpus by virtue of deed of transfer bearing

no.14610 and that the 5th defendant is also further entitled to a strip of land which is 3

feet in width by virtue of deed of transfer bearing no.12649 dated 12.08.1995.

CA-RII-05-21 Page 5 of 10 26/09/2023 IJ-27-23

It is being dissatisfied and aggrieved by the above judgment that the 5th defendant has

forwarded a notice of appeal to this Court dated 24.08.2017. However, the petitioner

states that, the 5th defendant, her husband could not pursue the petition of appeal as

he passed away on the 21.11.2019. It is in light of the above events that the petitioner

has preferred this present application of revision and restitution in integrum, to this

Court with regards to the impugned judgment of the learned District Judge.

The major contention underlying this application is that the learned District judge has

failed to duly consider the evidence and documents submitted before the court, prior to

delivering his judgment. This has resulted in a miscarriage of justice, for the defendants

have been unjustly deprived of their shares of the land due to the learned District judge

following the plaint rather than evaluating and perusing the evidence presented before

the Court.

Therefore, this Court consider the evidence lead before the District Court judge and

reiterate the following pedigree led before the District Court:

The above pedigree was led before the District Court and accordingly, the 4th and the 5th

defendants are entitled to 3/20, 1/15, and a road strip of 3ft in width as evidenced

through the documents submitted to the Court. Furthermore, this pedigree remained

uncontested. The above-mentioned road strip of 3ft is the lots named N & R which can

be identified, according to the survey plan marked, in the following manner:

Lot-N: 0.55

Lot-R: 0.91

Total: 1.46 Perches.

CA-RII-05-21 Page 7 of 10 26/09/2023 IJ-27-23

Therefore, as per the above-mentioned pedigree along with the entitlement of 1.46

perches to the 4th and the 5th Defendant, the final calculation of the shares should be

as follows:

1st Plaintiff: 10.32* Perches

2nd Plaintiff: 204/600 (Minus *10.32 + **1.46 Perches)

1st Defendant: 10/600

2nd Defendant: - No share

3rd Defendant: 120/600

4th and 5th Defendant 130/600

(4th Defendant- 45/600, 5th Defendant- 85/600 + **1.46 Perches)

Unallotted: 136 /600

It is evident from the above depiction of the allotment of the lots, the learned trial judge

has erroneously deprived the entitlement of the 4th and the 5th defendants, where the

learned trial judge has failed to consider the road strip of 1.46 perches to which the 5th

defendant is entitled by virtue of a deed of transfer bearing no.12649 dated 12.08.1995

(5V2). The learned trial judge has followed the pedigree averred in the plaint rather than

engaging in a perusal of the evidence and documents led before the court.

It is pertinent to highlight that it remains the duty of a trial judge to thoroughly evaluate

the evidence and the documents presented before a court, in order to arrive at a

determination, regardless of whether or not the matter before the court is contested or

uncontested. Therefore, it is the observation of this Court that, blindly allotting shares

to the parties is unacceptable as it lacks proper consideration of evidence and

documents presented before the court, by the witnesses (defendants).

In the case of Sopinona v Pitipanaarachchi and two Others 2010 (1) SLR 07, it was

held that In a partition action, it would be the prime duty of the Trial Judge to carefully

examine and investigate the actual rights and title to the land, sought to be partitioned. In

that process it would be essential for the Trial Judge to consider the evidence led on points

of contest and answer all of them, stating as to why they are accepted or rejected..

8

CA-RII-05-21 Page 8 of 10 26/09/2023 IJ-27-23

The above case further affirms the seminal duty of a trial judge to evaluate and examine

the documents and evidence presented before a court, prior to arriving at a just

determination. This is paramount because, in the absence of such thorough

examination, unjust deprivation of property rights to individuals occurs. The unjust

deprivation of property rights to an individual is unacceptable as every human being

has a natural right to property, therefore, the law must ensure the protection of such

rights rather than hindering the enjoyment of such rights. Furthermore, in a partition

matter, if the court erroneously deprives an individual of a property, it would cause a

flagrant violation of their rights, as it is possible, that the deprived property may be the

individuals sole property.

In English courts it was held in many cases that a judge should not rely solely on the

pleadings or statements in the plaintiff's complaint. Instead, the judge should consider

the evidence and documents introduced during the trial to arrive at a fair and just

decision. (Ross v. Caunters [1979] 3 WLR 131) and in Donoghue v. Stevenson [1932]

AC 562:This landmark case established the importance of considering the evidence and

facts presented during the trial. In this case, the House of Lords emphasized the need

for reasoned judgments that explain the basis for a judge's decision. It highlighted that

a judge should rely on the evidence and not be swayed solely by the plaintiff's allegations

Moreover, the lax consideration of evidence or negligence of a trial judge is taxing upon

the parties due to the unnecessary consumption of time and waste of money. Therefore,

the aggrieved litigants face the consequences of the errors made by the court. It is

further noteworthy that, in such an instance, the aggrieved litigants are not

compensated for the unnecessary consumption of time and money. Thus, it is

imperative that a trial judge examines and evaluates the evidence and documents

diligently, in order to ensure the due administration of justice.

In the case of Mather v. Tamotharam Pillai (1908) 6 NLR 246, the Full Bench of the

Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Layard decided more than 110 years ago that

A partition suit is not a mere proceeding inter partes to be settled of consent, or by the

opinion of the Court upon such points as they choose to submit to it in the shape of issues.

It is a matter in which the Court must satisfy itself that the plaintiff has made out his title,

and unless he makes out his title his suit for partition must be dismissed. In partition

proceedings the paramount duty is cast by the Ordinance upon the District Judge himself

9

CA-RII-05-21 Page 9 of 10 26/09/2023 IJ-27-23

to ascertain who are the actual owners of the land. As collusion between the parties is

always possible, and as they get their title from the decree of the Court, which is made

good and conclusive as against the world, no loopholes should be allowed for avoiding

the performance of the duty so cast upon the Judge.

The above determination of the Supreme Court cements the fact that a trial judge ought

to evaluate the evidence before the Court in order to ascertain the entitlements of the

parties involved. This, however, does not mean that a trial judge is expected to engage

in a voyage of discovery but rather is expected to duly approach the matter and engage

the judicial mind to arrive at a just determination after careful consideration of the

evidence and documents marked during the trial.

Furthermore, as this instant matter is submitted to this Court as a revisionary matter,

it is the duty of this Court to rectify the errors made by the learned trial judge in the

interest of justice, despite the prevalence of any delays or laches. Therefore, this Court

is not hesitant to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction in order to rectify the obvious

visible erroneous judgment of the trial judge, which unfairly deprived the rights of the

4th and the 5th defendants. Moreover, Article 145 of the Constitution has bestowed upon

the Court of Appeal, the revisionary powers to make any order in the interest of justice.

The Court of Appeal may, ex mero motu or on any application made, call for, inspect,

and examine any record of any Court of First Instance and in the exercise of its

revisionary powers may make any order thereon as the interests of justice may require.

Thus, it is pertinent to bring the instant matter within the ambit of Article 145 of the

Constitution, in order for this Court to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction. As the facts

of the instant matter are of such a nature that the 4th and 5th defendants have been

unjustly deprived of their rightful entitlements, this Court deems it fit to exercise its

revisionary jurisdiction as per Article 145 of the Constitution in the interest of justice.

In conclusion, this Court is of the view that this instant matter is a fit case for this Court

to intervene and order the revision of the learned trial judges judgment dated

08.08.2017 and the interlocutory decree entered; and thereby, I order to enter an

10

CA-RII-05-21 Page 10 of 10 26/09/2023 IJ-27-23

amended interlocutory decree as per the final calculation of the shares in the manner

depicted above in this judgment.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to dispatch a copy of this judgment to the District

Court of Horana, forthwith.

Application allowed.
