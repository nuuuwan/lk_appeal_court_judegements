The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Gampaha for the following offence.

2005 8

, -56

1996 22 1916

33 22 (1) 22 (3)

.

After the indictment has been served on the appellant, the charge has been read

out to him on 10th November 2017 by the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha.

The appellant has pleaded guilty to the charge, and accordingly after being

satisfied that the appellant has pleaded voluntarily, the learned High Court

Judge has convicted the appellant on his own plea.

At that stage, the learned Counsel who represented the appellant has informed

the Court that he had no instructions from the appellant that he is going to plead

Page 3 of 7

guilty to the charge. This has resulted in the learned High Court Judge inquiring

from the appellant and recording the following observation.

,

.

After convicting the appellant, the learned High Court Judge has allowed the

parties to make their submissions in relation to the sentence and on the basis

that the only sentence he can pass according to law, for a person convicted of an

offence of this nature, is to sentence that person for a life imprisonment, has

passed a sentence of life imprisonment on the appellant.

It is against this sentence that the appellant has filed this appeal, primarily on

the basis that the order dated 10-11-2017 by the learned High Court Judge was

contrary to the law and the appellant was not afforded a fair trial for the reasons

mentioned in the petition of appeal.

At the hearing of this appeal, it was the contention of the learned Presidents

Counsel that since it appears that the appellant has pleaded guilty to the charge

on his own accord, he has been misled in the way the charge has been preferred

against him, believing that he is pleading guilty to the charge for possessing a

gun.

Referring to section 22 of the Firearms Ordinance as amended by Firearms

(Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1996, the learned Presidents Counsel brings to the

notice of the Court that the section envisages several situations where a varied

sentences can be passed on a person, depending on number of conditions, as

well as, depending on whether the gun was an automatic gun or a repeater

shotgun or even whether the gun was a smooth-bore shotgun of the muzzle-

loading variety.

Page 4 of 7

It was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel that the charge in the

indictment does not specify the type of the gun, but only refers to a gun of a T-

56 variety and the appellant was clearly misled because of this lack of

information and if he was properly informed of the charge against him, he would

not have pleaded guilty to the charge on his own accord. It was the contention

of the learned Presidents Counsel that because of this misdirection, a fair trial

has not been afforded to the appellant, and moved for the setting aside of the

conviction and the sentence on that basis.

It was the contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) when the

appellant pleaded guilty on his own accord, he very well knew that the charge

against him was for possessing a T-56 weapon and it cannot be said that the

appellant was misled at the time of pleading guilty. However, he conceded that

the Government Analyst Report has not specifically mentioned that the relevant

weapon sent to the Government Analyst as an automatic gun.

It was his view that this is a matter that should be clarified by the Government

Analyst and he expressed the view that this is a fit matter where a retrial should

be ordered in view of the submissions made before this Court, and the

explanation that needs to be obtained for the Government Analyst in relation to

the weapon produced before him for analysis.

As I have stated before, the indictment does not state that the weapon alleged to

have been possessed by the appellant is an automatic weapon, but merely says

that he had in his possession a gun namely, a T-56 firearm. In the Government

Analyst Report too, the Government Analyst has not specifically identified

whether it was an automatic gun or a repeater shotgun but has stated that the

weapon comes under the definition of a gun.

Section 22 (1) of the Firearms Ordinance No. 23 of 1916 which has not been

amended by Firearms (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1996 reads as follows.

Page 5 of 7

22 (1). No person shall have in his custody, or possess or use, any

gun, unless he shall hold a licence therefor in accordance with

this Ordinance (herein referred to as a gun licence).

By Firearms (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1996, section 22 (3) of the principle

enactment has been repealed and the following subsection has been substituted.

22 (3). Any person contravening the provisions of this section shall

be guilty of an offence against this ordinance and shall on conviction

be punishable-

(a) for the first offence with a fine not exceeding ten thousand

rupees or with rigorous imprisonment for a period not

exceeding five years or with both such fine and imprisonment;

(b) for the second or any subsequent offence, with rigorous

imprisonment for a period of not less than ten years and not

exceeding twenty years:

Provided that where the offence consists of having the custody

or possession of, or of using, an automatic gun or repeater

shotgun, the offender shall be punished with imprisonment for

life:

Provided further that where the offence consists of having the

custody and possession of, or of using, a smooth bore shotgun

of the muzzle loading variety, the offence, shall be punishable

as provided for in section 44.

For better understanding of this judgement, I will now reproduce the repealed

section 22 (3) of the principal enactment which reads thus.

22 (3). Any person contravening any of the provisions of this section

shall be guilty of an offence against this Ordinance and shall on

conviction be punishable

Page 6 of 7

(a) for the first offence with a fine of not more than two

thousand five hundred rupees, or with rigorous imprisonment

for a period not exceeding one year, or with both such fine and

imprisonment; and

(b) for the second or any subsequent offence with a fine of not

more than two thousand five hundred rupees or with rigorous

imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or with both

such fine and imprisonment:

Provided that where the offence consists of having the custody

or possession of, or of using, a smooth bore shot gun of the

muzzle-loading variety the offence shall be punishable as

provided in section 44.

When one compares section 22 (3) before it was repealed, and as it stands now,

it is clear that the present section 22 (3) envisages several situations where

different kind of punishments can be imposed based on the type of the gun that

comes within the offence.

It appears that when this indictment was drafted, the necessity to indicate

whether the appellant has committed an offence in relation to any gun as stated

in section 22 (1) or whether the indictment refers to as stated in section 22 (3) in

relation to an automatic gun or repeater shotgun has evaded the attention of the

drafter of the indictment.

It is the view of this Court that it is essential to mention in a charge under

Firearms Ordinance, the above-mentioned information as the punishable section

for possessing a gun which is not an automatic gun or a repeater shotgun or

even a smooth-bore shotgun of the muzzle-loading variety is the same section 22

(3) of the Firearms Ordinance as amended by Firearms (Amendment) Act No. 22

of 1996.

Page 7 of 7

I find merit in the learned Presidents Counsels argument that when the charge

was read over to him, the appellant pleaded guilty on his own accord as the

charge does not refer to having him in his possession, an automatic gun but

merely a gun.

I find it may be the reason why he has stated when questioned by the Court that

he is pleading guilty to possessing this weapon ( ).

It is the considered view of this Court that all these above factors may have led

to the appellant pleading guilty to the charge expecting a punishment for

possessing a gun in terms of section 22 (3), which is different from the

punishment that can be imposed for a person who possessed an automatic gun

or a repeater shotgun.

It is the view of this Court that the way the charge has been drafted has denied

a fair trial, towards the appellant, and therefore, the conviction and the sentence

of the appellant cannot be allowed to stand. Accordingly, the conviction and the

sentence of the appellant is hereby set aside.

Having considered the facts and the circumstances, it is the view of this Court

that this is an action where a retrial should be ordered, and a retrial of this

matter is hereby ordered.

Appeal allowed to the above extent.
