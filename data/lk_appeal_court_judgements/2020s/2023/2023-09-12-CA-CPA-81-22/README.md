This is an application by the 1st claimant-appellant-petitioner (hereinafter

referred to as the petitioner) invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court in

terms of Article 138 of the Constitution.

When this matter was supported before this Court, having heard the petitioner,

this Court decided to grant notice, and accordingly, upon receiving the notice,

the respondent-respondents have filed their objections as required.

At the hearing of this application, this Court had the benefit of listening to the

submissions made by the learned Counsel for the petitioner, as well as the

learned State Counsel, on behalf of the respondent-respondents.

The Officer in Charge of Sammanthurai police has charged the two accused

mentioned in the petition before the Magistrates Court of Sammanthurai for

allegedly committing an offence punishable in terms of section 3D of the Animals

Act No. 29 of 1958 as amended by the Animals (Amendment) Act No. 10 of 2009.

The provided translation of the charge sheet preferred against the two accused

on 29-06-2020 reads as follows;

The above named accused on or about 26th June 2020 at Nellupitiya

junction within the jurisdiction of this Court by transporting

buffaloes in the night without having a valid permit you have

committed an offence knowingly and intentionally under the section

3D of the Animals Act No. 29 of 1958 and amended Animals Act No.

10 of 2009.

When the charge was read over to the accused before the learned Magistrate of

Sammanthurai, both of them have pleaded guilty to the charge and accordingly

they have been sentenced to a fine of Rs.10000/= each, with a default sentence

of three-month imprisonment each.

Page 5 of 13

It is clear from the charge to which the accused have pleaded guilty, they have

been informed that transporting 68 heads of buffaloes in the night without

having a valid permit was the offence committed by them.

As a result of the conviction and the sentence on the basis that the accused have

transported the 68 heads of buffaloes mentioned in the charged sheet, the

learned Magistrate of Sammanthurai has allowed the petitioner who came before

the Court as the owner of the animals to show cause as to why the animals

should not be confiscated in terms of the Animals Act.

At the inquiry held in that regard, the petitioner has given evidence and had

claimed that he purchased 70 heads of animals from a person in

Siyambalanduwa. It had been his position that while he was in the process of

obtaining the necessary permits to transport the animals, his two assistants

have herded the animals, at which point, the police have taken the animals and

the two accused into custody. He has produced cattle vouchers and cattle

receipts he obtained from the person from whom he purchased the cattle as

evidence, and has also called the person who sold the animals to him as a

witness to substantiate his position.

The position of the petitioner had been that he is the owner of the animals and

he purchased them legally, and while he was in the process of obtaining the

necessary permits to transport, the accused have herded the animals without

his knowledge. On that basis, he has claimed the animals.

The learned Magistrate of Kalmunai by his order dated 07-07-2020 has decided

that the owner of the animals failed to prove his ownership or to satisfy the Court

that the offence was committed without his knowledge, presence, and beyond

his consent. On that basis, the learned Magistrate of Sammanthurai proceeded

to confiscate the said cattle in terms of section 3AA(3)(a) of the Animals Act as

amended.

The petitioner being aggrieved by the said order has preferred an application in

revision to the Provincial High Court of the Eastern Province Holden at Kalmunai.

Page 6 of 13

After considering the application, the learned High Court Judge of Kalmunai,

pronouncing his order dated 09-02-2022, has decided that there was no material

for the Provincial High Court to interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate

and had affirmed the order and dismissed the application made in revision by

the petitioner.

It is against the above-mentioned two orders; the petitioner has now come before

this Court seeing to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction conferred to this Court in

terms of Article 138 of the Constitution.

At the hearing of this application, it was the contention of the learned Counsel

for the petitioner that the main reason for the rejection of the claim by the owner

of the animals by the learned Magistrate had been that the age of the animals

given in the cattle vouchers and the corresponding cattle receipts do not match,

and the claim of the owner that he was not privy to the actions of the accused

cannot be accepted.

It was his position that there was no dispute as to the ownership of the cattle

and although the accused were charged for having transported the cattle, in fact,

they were only herding the cattle when they were arrested. It was his position

that herding of cattle by foot would not amount to transporting of the cattle as

envisaged in the provisions of the Animals Act. It was also his position that if the

learned Magistrate was not certain about the ages of the animals claimed by the

owner, the learned Magistrate should have given effect to his order made in the

journal entry dated 02-07-2020 of the Magistrate Court case record, before

pronouncing his order five days thereafter, on 07-07-2020.

It appears from the journal entry dated 02-07-2020 of the Magistrates Court

case record, that it was the date fixed by the learned Magistrate for his order in

relation to the inquiry. However, on that day, the learned Magistrate, instead of

pronouncing his order, has made the following Directive which reads thus;

Page 7 of 13

At this stage-

For the interest of justice, I order to Registrar of the Court to call the full

report regarding cattle of this case from the veterinary surgeon-

Sammanthurai. Registrar to take steps and issue a letter to the veterinary

surgeon.

Speedy action is needed for this purpose. Refixed for order on 07-07- 2020.

However, there is no indication in the Magistrates Court case record whether

the Registrar of the Court carried out the Directive of the learned Magistrate for

whatever the purpose the directive was given, or whether the veterinary surgeon

sent a report as required.

On 07-07-2020, the relevant order in relation to the inquiry had been

pronounced, confiscating the animals and, the learned Magistrate has directed

that the cattle to be handed over to an animal care center. He has also called for

a report from the veterinary surgeon on the basis that he has failed to submit a

report to the Court.

It was in this backdrop the petitioner has invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of

the Provincial High Court of the Eastern Province Holden at Kalmunai.

The learned High Court Judge by the impugned order has justified the reasons

given by the learned Magistrate in his order of confiscation of the cattle. However,

it appears from the impugned order that the learned High Court Judge has

extensively discussed the provisions as to the transportation of animals under

the provisions of the Act and the requirements an owner of a vehicle should prove

in an inquiry.

In his order, the learned High Court Judge has stated;

Thus, it cannot be considered that taking of the said cattle from

Siyambalanduwa to this area without permit was done without the

Page 8 of 13

knowledge of the petitioner. In this case nobody else has submitted

ownership claims other than 1st and 2nd claimants for these 68 cattle.

Based on the above reasons, there is a doubt whether those 68 cattle were

purchased by the petitioner? It should be ascertained if Jayantha Kamal

sold those 68 cattle unto the petitioner, whether he abetted for taking those

cattle from Siyambalanduwa to Sammanthurai without permit.

Legal Position

The following decided cases has dealt with the legal position in respect of

matters that should be proved by the person who claim ownership of things

and vehicles that is used while commitment of an offence under section 3 of

the Animals Act.

It is clear from the above reasoning, that the learned High Court Judge has been

careful not to use the word transport in his order. Instead, he has used the term

taking of the said cattle which gives a different meaning than the word

transport.

I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge was not correct when he

decided to use taking instead of the words used in the charge preferred against

the accused which was transporting of the cattle, as the two terms mentioned

above have different meanings, I am of the view that a Court is not entitled to

twist the words mentioned in a particular section of a statue to justify a decision

reached by a Court of law.

In the above conclusion of the learned High Court Judge, section 3 of the Animals

Act has been mentioned as the provision under which he has determined that a

person who claims ownership of things and vehicles should establish his or her

claim, in citing decided judgements in that regard.

However, it needs to be noted that section 3 of the Animals Act provides for the

Subject Minister to make regulations in following matters, which reads;

Page 9 of 13

3. (1) the prohibition, restriction, control, or regulation of the

transport of animals within, to or from, any administrative district;

(2) the conditions subject to which the slaughter of animals may

be permitted;

(3) the stoppage and examination of vehicles in which animals are

being transported; and

(4) the establishment of checking stations at which any vehicle

may be required to stop to enable the officer-in-charge of such station

to examine the vehicle for the purpose of ascertaining whether any

animals are being transported in contravention of any regulation

made under this part;

(5) Procedure to be observed in applying for permits for the

transport of animals; and

(6) Prescription of fees in respect of transport permits.

Although the learned High Court Judge has used section 3 of the Animals Act as

the provision under which the relevant legal positions should be considered, the

actual section the learned High Court Judge has considered appears to be

section 3A of the Animals Act as amended by Animals Amendment Act No. 10 of

1968, which is the provision under which a Magistrates Court has power to

confiscate vehicles. The relevant section 3A reads as follows;

3A. Where any person is convicted of an offence under this part or

any regulations made thereunder, any vehicle used in the commission

of such offence shall in addition to any other punishment prescribed

for such offence, be liable, by order of the convicting Magistrate to

confiscation.

Provided, however, that in any case where the owner of the vehicle is

a third party, no order of confiscation shall be made if the owner

Page 10 of 13

proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he has taken all

precautions to prevent the use of such vehicle or that the vehicle had

been used without his knowledge to the commission of the offence.

I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge was misdirected when he

decided to mix the claim of ownership of things and confiscation of vehicles, to

determine this matter.

Whereas, it should be in terms of section 3AA(3) that a Magistrate should act in

a case of an animal in relation to an offence by a person who has committed an

offence referred to in subsection (1) of section 3AA of the Animals Act.

The subsection (1) refers to situations where a Magistrate with competent

jurisdiction can order the temporary custody of an animal against whom an

offence has been committed to an institution mentioned in the section.

The relevant section 3AA(3) which attracts the confiscation of animals as

considered by the learned Magistrate of Sammanthurai reads as follows;

3AA(3). Where the person who committed the offence referred to in

subsection (1) is convicted of such offence, the Magistrate shall in

addition to the punishment he may impose in relation thereto-

(a) make order that the animal be confiscated; or

(b) make order that the animal be handed over to the owner of

the animal, upon his establishing ownership of the animal

and on the owner showing cause that the offence was

committed or was sought to have been committed without

his knowledge or connivance.

It is abundantly clear from the charge preferred against the accused before the

learned Magistrate of Sammanthurai, the Officer-in-Charge of the police station

of Sammanthurai has formulated the charge on the basis that the accused were

transporting 68 heads of cattle in the night without having a valid permit.

Although the charge preferred indicates the section namely, 3D of the of the

Page 11 of 13

Animals Act as the penal section, this is a penal section that should be common

to any offence committed under Part II of the of the Animals Act, which includes

contravention of any regulation made under the Act.

However, since it had been informed in the charge that the offence committed by

the accused was transporting cattle without a permit, it needs to be assumed

that the relevant section the accused supposed to have violated is section 3C(1)

of the Act.

The relevant section 3C(1) of the Act reads;

3C(1). No person shall transport any animal within, to, or from, any

administrative district except under the authority of a transport

permit issued by the Assistant Government Agent of a division of that

administrative district for that purpose.

There is no dispute that, although the charge refers to the transportation of

animals, in fact when this alleged detection was made, the accused had been

herding the 68 heads of cattle by foot in a place called Nellupitiya junction.

Since the accused have been charged on the basis of transportation of animals,

it becomes necessary for this Court to look into the possible interpretation of the

word transport in order to find whether herding of animals in this manner can

be interpreted as a form of transportation as envisaged for the purposes of the

Animals Act.

The argument of the learned Counsel for the petitioner was that herding of

animals would not fall under the category of transportation and therefore there

was no basis for the learned Magistrate to charge the accused for illegal

transportation and to order an inquiry in terms of section 3AA(3).

It is the view of this Court that, although the learned State Counsel on behalf of

the respondents contented that the confiscation of animals was justified as the

owner has failed to establish his ownership and his knowledge as stated in the

impugned orders, what matters the most is the fact whether the herding of

Page 12 of 13

animals would come under the meaning of transportation of animals as stated

in the Animals Act.

The word transportation had not been defined in the Act. However, if one reads

the relevant sections of the Act, it is abundantly clear that the purpose of making

regulations in terms of section 3 of the Animals Act was to regulate

transportation of the animals in vehicles and for nothing else.

It is the view of this Court that the word transport mentioned in section 3C of

the Animals Act needs to be considered in that context. If the intention of the

legislature was to place restrictions as to taking cattle or any other animal for

that matter from place to place in any means other than vehicles, it should have

been reflected in the wordings of the relevant section. I do not find any reasons

to interpret the relevant sections to say that transport should include even

herding or any other form of taking cattle from one place to another.

In village settings where cattle herding is a common occurrence, if the provisions

of the Animals Act are to be interpreted in such a manner, it would amount to a

situation where the farmers or cattle herdsmen would require permits to engage

in their daily livelihood. I do not see that this was the purpose of the Animals

Act.

I am of the view that there was no basis for the Officer-in-Charge of the

Sammanthurai police to charge the accused in terms of the Animals Act for

transporting without a permit other than charging them in terms of the

Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, if they have committed an offence in terms

of the said Act.

It is my considered view that the learned Magistrate was wrong to have charged

the accused on the basis of transporting the animals without a permit, and

misdirected as to the facts and the relevant law when it was decided to hold an

inquiry in terms of section 3AA(3) of the Animals Act.

Page 13 of 13

I am also of the view that the learned High Court Judge was also misdirected as

to the facts and the relevant law when the order of the learned Magistrate was

affirmed. I find that the petitioner has adduced sufficient exceptional

circumstances before this Court for this Court to interfere into the relevant

orders considered in this matter.

For the reasons as considered above, I set aside the order of the learned

Magistrate of Sammanthurai dated 07-07-2020, and the order of the learned

High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the Eastern Province Holden at

Kalmunai dated 09-02-2022, as both the above orders cannot be allowed to

stand.

I direct the learned Magistrate of Sammanthurai to release the heads of cattle

which were the subject matter of the inquiry held before the learned Magistrate

to the person or persons who claimed the ownership of the animals before the

Magistrates Court.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgement to the

Magistrates Court of Sammanthurai as well as to the Provincial High Court of

the Eastern Province Holden at Kalmunai for information and necessary action.
