1st to 13th Respondents - 26.09.2023

Decided on: 10.10.2023

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

Uva Provincial Council Public Service Commission (Uva-PSC) has terminated the

employment of the Petitioner from the post of Legal Officer of the Uva-PSC by way of a letter

dated 03.11.2020 marked P3, on the alleged grounds that the Petitioner failed to meet the

requirements set out in Clause 96 of the Procedural Rules relating to Uva-PSC (Rules),

marked P5. This decision had been taken by the Uva-PSC subsequent to extending the

probationary period of the Petitioner in the position of Legal Officer mainly on two occasions.

Firstly, for a period of one year with effect from 28.03.2019 to 27.03.2020 by way of a letter

dated 2019.12.13 (P20). Secondly, the probationary period of the Petitioner was extended

for a period of 6 months with effect from 28.03.2020 to 27.09.2020 by way of a letter dated

03.07.2020 (P21). The Petitioner has been informed on several occasions to improve her

performance and additionally by way of a letter dated 23.07.2020 ( P22) along with a

number of other letters, the Petitioner has been provided with an opportunity to give reasons

for her alleged inefficiency.

The instant Application has been filed by the Petitioner seeking a writ of Certiorari quashing

the above documents marked "P3", "P20", "P21" and "P22" as well as a writ of Mandamus

directing the above named Respondents to confirm the Petitioner in her post.

Primarily, what needs resolution by this Court in the instant Application is, whether the

termination of the appointment of the Petitioner relating to the post of Legal Officer of the

Uva -PSC is lawful and also whether the 5th Respondent - Secretary to the Uva-PSC or the

13th Respondent - Deputy Chief Secretary of the Uva Provincial Council has authority to

terminate the said employment of the Petitioner.

Whether the Period of Probation Relating to the Petitioner Can be Extended Beyond Three Years

The Chapter VIII of the said Rules (P5) deals with the a.) period of probation, b.) period of

acting and c.) confirmation of appointment. According to Clause 94 of the said Rules, the

appointing authority shall subject newly appointed public officers to a post in the public

service (of the Uva Province) to a probationary period of 3 years. The salient feature of the

said clause is that every such public officer should mandatorily be subjected to a probationary

period of 3 years. A question arising from one aspect of the Petitioners arguments, in the way

in which such arguments are formulated, is whether the period of probation can be extended.

Clause 99 of the Rules stipulates a procedure that needs to be followed during the 1st and 2nd

years of the probation. In view of those provisions, a final review report in relation to the

probationer should be submitted along with the 1st and 2nd year reports to the appointing

authority at least three months prior to the expiry of the period of probation. During the three

years of probation, it is expressly intended that three review reports be made accessible.

According to the said Clause 99, before the probationary period expires, the appointing

authority is required to evaluate all three reports and issue an order either confirming or

extending the probationary period.

Therefore, it is abundantly clear that the period of probation after three years from the

appointment can be extended. The provisions relating to such extensions beyond the first

three years are stipulated in Clause 101 of the Rules. The Petitioner states that it is apparent

from reading P20, P21, and P22 that no proper extensions of the probation period have

been made under the provisions of Chapter VIII of the said Rules. It is clearly a misconception

to raise such an argument by reading the provisions in Clause 101 in isolation without reading

it together with the other pertinent provisions in the said Chapter VIII of the Rules. What is

clearly meant in the said Clause 101 is that, the appointing authority has the power to extend

the period of probation by one year at a time subject to a maximum period of 03 years if the

officer is not fit and suitable for confirmation. The appointing authority may even defer the

officers increments.

Even under section 11:7 of the Establishments Code (E-Code), if an officer is not judged

during the first three years of the probation as fit and qualified for confirmation either his

Page 7 of 11

appointment can be terminated or the period of probation can be extended subject to other

specific provisions of the E-Code.

Hence, I hold that the period of probation relating to the Petitioner can be extended beyond

the first three years provided that a proper assessment is carried out as per the provisions in

the Rules or the E-Code.

Whether the Extension of the Period of Probation Made Effective under and in Terms of the

Provisions Of the Establishment Code is Illegal

The Petitioner contends that the extension of the probationary period of her employment for

a period of one year with effect from 28.03.2019 to 27.03.2020 (Vide P20), is bad in law.

The reason given for such an assertion is that the said extension was carried out under sections

11:7 and 11:10 of Chapter II and section 10:4 of Chapter VII of the E-Code as appears in the

said letter P20. The Petitioners argument is based on the preamble portion of the said

Rules which declares that the E-Code provisions should be applicable for matters which are

not covered under the Rules in P5. Sections 11:5, 11:7 and 11:10 of Chapter II of the E-

Code, among other provisions, deal with the extension of the probationary period beyond

three years.

11:5 If at the end of the period of probation or at the end of the acting period, the officers work

and conduct are judged to have been satisfactory, and if he has fulfilled all the requirement for

confirmation in that appointment, he should be confirmed in his appointment by the relevant

authority.

11:7 If the officer is not judged as fit and qualified for confirmation in all respects, either his

appointment should be terminated or the period of probation or the acting period should be further

extended by the appointing authority subject to section 11:9 or 11:10 and provided that,

11:7:1 where the Appointing Authority is the Head of Department to whom power of

appointment has been delegated, he should not extend the period of Probation by more

than one year without the approval of the Secretary.

11:7:2 In the case of an officer appointed to act in a post with a view to confirmation in

terms of section 11:3, the Appointing Authority should not extend the acting period

Page 8 of 11

without the concurrence of the Appointing Authority of the substantive post. If the period

of extension is more than one year he should also obtain the approval of the Secretary.

11:10 If an officer fails to qualify for confirmation at the proper time, that is within the initial

period of probation, for reasons within his control, but qualifies for confirmation during an

extension of the period of probation granted to him in terms of subsection 11:7 then

It is true that the particular provisions of the E-Code are noticeable on the face of the letter

marked P20. But it is significant to observe that many provisions spelled out in the Rules

are notably similar to that of the E-Code, although not identical. It appears that the extension

of the period of probation is substantially covered under the Rules and however, one cannot

possibly overlook the fact that the basic concept of those provisions of the Rules is embodied

in the particular provisions of the E-Code. Furthermore, the above E-Code provisions also

permit the appointing authority to extend the period of probation subject to an assessment.

The only explicit difference that can be seen between the respective provisions of the Rules

and the E-Code is that the Rules have identified a specific 3-year period up to which the

probationary status can be extended upon the completion of the first three years.

Based on the circumstances of the instant Application the nexus or the relationship between

the Rules and the E-Code should not be ruptured by giving effect to the aforesaid technical

argument of the Petitioner. Hence, I take the view that it is not fair to employ the doctrine of

ultra vires to issue an order quashing P20 solely based on the visibility of the E-Code

provisions on the face of the said letter P20. The several steps taken by the Respondents

under and in terms of the Rules during the decision making process relevant to the instant

Application are not opposed effectively by the Petitioner. Similarly, the Petitioner has failed

to provide to Court the adequate material opposing the assessments carried out by the

respective Respondents. I observe that no substantive prejudice has been caused to the

Petitioner due to the inclusion of the E-Code provisions in the document "P20," as the

ultimate outcome would remain unchanged even if the Respondents were to refer to the

specific Rules.

Whether the P3 is Illegal on the Grounds that it has been Issued under Clause 102 of the Rules

Page 9 of 11

The contention of the Petitioner is that upon perusal of the document marked P3, in which

the termination of probationary services of the Petitioner has been effected, it could be

perceived that such services were terminated under Clause 102 of the Rules and the said

Clause 102 is not applicable at all for such a termination.

Clause 102 of the Rules declares that at the end of each extended period of probation, the

Head of the Department shall prepare a review report as per Appendix 05. Further, where

such a report reveals deficiencies that may prevent the officers suitability for confirmation in

his post, it shall be the responsibility of the appointing authority to extend or terminate the

appointment of the respective officer subject to Clauses 99 and 100.

On a careful perusal of the substance of the letter marked P3 it implies that Uva-PSC in a

detailed manner has referred to Clauses 96 and 102 of the Rules. As such the Petitioners

argument is a clear misrepresentation of facts made simply by referring to a numeral of a

single Clause without giving due effect to the intention of the authorities. Once again it needs

to be stressed that it is clearly a misconception to raise such an argument by reading the

provisions in Clause 102 in isolation without reading it together with the other pertinent

provisions in the said Chapter VIII of the Rules along with the material submitted to Court.

When determining the questions relating to the instant Application, it is important to take

into consideration the overall circumstances of this case for fuller and proper adjudication of

this matter. In light of the above, I am convinced even with the reasons given by the

Information Officer of the Uva-PSC who referred to a query made by the Petitioner in regard

to the application of Clause 102 of the Rules.

I have expressed in Lanka Canneries (Pvt) Ltd vs. Commissioner of Labour and Others

CA/WRIT/385/2021 decided on 31/08.2022 when an employer takes a decision to extend the

probationary period or to terminate the services, he should follow a procedure, according to

law, where such decision-making power may not infringe the Rule of Law and the principles

of Natural Justice. This infers that, any employer should mandatorily follow an effective

procedure right throughout the period of probation if an employer needs to enjoy the benefit

of not confirming probationers. On a careful consideration of the whole matter, I arrive at the

conclusion that the decision making process of the relevant Respondents during the period of

probation relating to the Petitioner is not violative of the principles of Natural Justice or the

Page 10 of 11

Rule of Law. The decision of the Uva-PSC to terminate the appointment of the Petitioner

cannot be considered unlawful as no reasonable grounds were established for this Court to

consider quashing the said decision.

The clear purpose of extending the period of probation beyond three years is to provide

opportunities for such officers to diligently engage in improving their performances during

such an extended period. Thus, it can be clearly assumed that the extension of probationary

period was eventually in favor of this Petitioner and such extension should not be used as a

tool to seek from Court to employ the doctrine of ultra vires or any other ground of review in

order to obtain reliefs as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition. This is especially because the

Petitioner is not adequately impugning the reasons given by the Respondents to extend her

period of probation but challenging only the extension per se.

Whether the 13th Respondent has Authority to make Decisions and Determinations Relating to the

Employment of the Petitioner

I cannot properly understand the underpinnings of the Petitioners argument that the 13th

Respondent1 has no authority to make decisions or determinations relating to the employment

of the Petitioner based on the alleged grounds that he is not the appointing or disciplinary

authority pertaining to the Petitioner. The Petitioner contends that by way of section 32 of

the Provincial Council Act No.42 of 1987 the power to appoint, promote, transfer, terminate

and for the disciplinary control of officers of a Provincial Public Service lies solely with the

Governor of that respective province. While endorsing the contents of the said section 32 it is

important to note that according to section 32(2) of the said Act, the Governor of a Province

may, from time to time, delegate his powers of appointment, transfer, dismissal and

disciplinary control of officers of the provincial public service to the Public Service

Commission of that Province. The Petitioner has not expressly denied that the Governor has

delegated his powers to the Uva-PSC under the above section. It is not a disputed fact that the

letter of termination P3 and several other letters have been copied to the Chief Secretary of

the Uva Province while some letters have originated from the office of the Chief Secretary of

Uva Province itself. I need not lengthen this judgement explaining how the Chief Secretary

1 Vide - paragraph 23 (iii) and paragraph d.) of the prayer of the Petition.

Page 11 of 11

gets the authority to sign respective letters since it is obvious that those letters have been

authenticated as a consequence to the decisions taken by the Governor or the Uva-PSC.

Therefore, I cannot accept the proposition of the Petitioner that the decisions reflected in the

letters such as P3,P20,P21,P22 are bad in law. Although the Petitioner seeks a writ

of Certiorari against "P22", no reasons are given by the Petitioner to justify her challenge

against the said letter "P22".

Conclusion

In light of the above, there is no necessity to make an additional effort to analyze the

objections in the preliminary nature raised on behalf of the Respondents and also the issues

such as the availability of alternative reliefs, contractual relationship, etc. I see no valid

grounds, in view of the reasons given above, to grant any of the reliefs prayed for in the prayer

of the Petition of the Petitioner. Therefore, I proceed to dismiss the Application. I order no

costs.
