JUDGMENT

The position of the petitioner is that she is a co owner of an amalgamated

Arambewatta and Gamewatta in extent of about 01 acre described in Deed of

Gift No. 1545 dated 15.09.1996 marked X.1. She claims through her father.

She also claims that her mother Withthamperuma Arachchige Pushpa Nandani

too is the owner of undivided 3/16th share and 23/64th share. In respect of

possession of the land she states that her father was having a coconut plantation

having obtained subsidies from the Coconut Plantation Board. She avers that

she, her parents and grand parents have possessed the land for over 50 years.

The position of the 1st to 03rd respondents is that they are unaware of the above.

The respondents also say that the petitioner has failed to identify the land

claimed by her.

It is stated in paragraph 03(ix) that,

In the year 1984 a resident Bhikku of the Pokunuwita Rajamaha

Viharaya namely Ekneligoda Indrasumana Thero made a claim to the said

land as a result of which there was a dispute which was referred to the

Horana Magistrate by the Horana police in terms of section 66 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act. However the said Thero admitted that the

petitioners father W. D. Gamini Ratnayake was in possession in the said

3 | C . A . W r i t A p p l i c a t i o n 3 0 8 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a

land and accordingly the Magistrates Court made order granting

possession of the said land to the petitioners father.

The 1st to 3rd respondents are unaware of the above.

However, in the proceedings in case No. 62071 dated 03.09.1984 of Magistrates

Court of Horana, in respect of a land called Arambewatte between Ekneligoda

Indrasumana Thero and Vidanaralalage Don Gamini Ratnayake the said

Indrasumana Thero has admitted that the 2nd respondent is in possession and

the 2nd respondent has been placed in possession. The said Don Gamini

Ratnayake is the father of the petitioner. The Marriage certificate of Don Gamini

Ratnayake and the mother of the petitioner Withthamperuma Arachchige

Pushpa Nandani has been attached as P.14.

The Deed of Gift No. 1545 is attached as X.1. In that deed Don Gamini

Ratnayake identifies Vidanaralalage Dona Wasana Thilini Ratnayake, the

petitioner as his daughter.

Hence it is clear that the petitioner has shown sufficient relationship in respect

of her standing in this case. It is clear that the petitioner and respondents claim

the same land. There is no question or dispute in respect of identification. This

is not a case by which petitioner claims title to the land. The question is about

standing.

The petitioner points out that it is stated in Wada & Forsyth (10th Edition) at

page 585,586 that,

The prerogative remedies, being of a public character as emphasized

earlier, have always had more liberal rules about standing than the

remedies of private law. Prerogative remedies are granted at the suit of the

Crown; and the Crown always has standing to take action against public

authorities, including its own ministers, who act or threaten to act

unlawfully. As Delvin J., said Orders of Certiorari and Prohibition are

concerned principally with public order, it being a duty of the High Court

4 | C . A . W r i t A p p l i c a t i o n 3 0 8 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a

to see the inferior courts confine themselves to their own limited sphere.

Consequently the court is prepared to act at the instance of a mere

stranger, though it retains discretion to refuse to do so if it considers that

no good would be done to the public. Every citizen has standing to invite

the court prevent some abuse of power and doing so he may claim to be

regarded not as meddle some busybody but as a public benefactor. Parker

L. J., thus stated the law as to Certiorari,

Anybody can apply for it a member of the public, who has been

inconvenienced, or a particular party or person who has a particular

grievance of his own. If the application is made by what for

convenience one may call a stranger, the remedy is purely

discretionary. Where, however, it is made by a person who has a

particular grievance of his own, whether as party or otherwise

and then the remedy lies ex debitio justitio. [Emphasis added in

this judgment]

It is pertinent to consider paragraphs 04 to 07 of the petition, which reads, as

follows,

04. In or about June 2018 Surveyors of the Surveyor Generals

Department surveyed the lands in the area for the Bimsaviya programme

of the Government and the petitioners mother Pushpa Nandani was

informed by the Surveyors that the petitioners land had been declared as

Sacred area of the Pokunuwita Kithsiri Mewan Rajamaha Viharaya.

05. The petitioner and her mother immediately sought legal advice and

they were required to obtain all necessary documents in order to resort to

their legal remedy.

06. The petitioner and her mother immediately made inquiries and on

12.06.2018 they were able to obtain a certified copy of Surveyor Generals

5 | C . A . W r i t A p p l i c a t i o n 3 0 8 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a

plan No. Mu. Pi. Ka4141 and the said plan and the report are annexed

hereto marked Y.1.

07. The petitioner and her mother made further inquiries on 17.08.2018

they were able to obtain from the National Archives Department a certified

copy of Gazette No. 1592/13 dated 13th March 2009 wherein the then

Minister of Urban Development and Sacred Area Development had made

order dated 13th March 2009 declaring the said land depicted in Plan Y.1

had been declared as a Sacred area of the Pokunuwita Kithsirimewan

Rajamaha Viharaya.

The respondents are unaware of averments in paragraphs 04 and 05.

There is no denial or acceptance of paragraphs 06 and 07.

It is stated in paragraph 05 of the Statement of Objections,

Answering the averments in paragraph 11, the respondents deny the

averments therein and state that

i. By the Extra Ordinary Gazette bearing No. 1592/13 of 13.03.2009,

the Minister of Urban Development and Sacred Area Development, by

the powers vested in him under sections 6(2)(b) and 21(2)(b) of the

Town and Country Planning Ordinance, declared the scheduled area

of land to be an urban development area;

ii. The said area of land in extent of 2.7622 hectares, comprising of Lot

No.1 and Lot. No. 2 is depicted in the Surveyor Generals Plan bearing

No. KA/HRN/08/348 and dated 29.12.2008;

iii. The Order of Declaration of an Urban Development Area made under

section 6(2)(b) of the Town and Country Planning Ordinance does not

require any recommendation from the Coordinating Committee set

up under section 4A;

6 | C . A . W r i t A p p l i c a t i o n 3 0 8 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a

iv. As the said declaration has been made under the powers vested by

section 6(2)(b) and 21(2)(b) there is no legal requirement to follow the

procedure in section 21(4).

What is section 6(2)(b) of Town and Country Planning Ordinance of 1946?

PART II

DEVELOPMENT AREAS AND PLANNING AND EXECUTIVE AUTHORITIES

Urban development areas.

6.

(2) The Minister may, by Order published in the Gazette, declare-

(b) that any area, other than a Municipality or a town referred to in subsection

(1) or paragraph (a) of this subsection, specified in the Order,

shall be an urban development area for the purposes of this Ordinance.

Section 21(2)(b) reads,

Order for preparation of scheme.

21.

(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3), the Minister may, of his own

motion or upon the recommendation of the Central Planning Commission, by

Order published in the Gazette direct-

(b) that an outline scheme shall be prepared for any urban development area

or for any land in any such area; or

Section 21(2) is subject to subsection (3). It reads,

7 | C . A . W r i t A p p l i c a t i o n 3 0 8 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a

(3) The Minister shall not make an Order directing the preparation

of any outline scheme or detailed scheme for any area or land which

is situated in any regional development area unless a regional scheme

for that region has come into operation, or where no such scheme has

come into operation, unless the Regional Planning Committee for that area

consents to the making of the Order.

Therefore under section 6(2)(b) the Minister can declare Urban Development

Areas.

Under section 21(2)(b) an Outline Scheme must be prepared.

It is not stated in Statement of Objections that provisions in section 21(3) has

been followed.

To prepare an Outline scheme there should be a regional scheme for that

region.

It is stated neither in Statement of Objections or written submissions of the

respondents that (1) a regional scheme for that region has come into operation

or (2) if there is no such scheme that has come into operation the Regional

Planning Committee for that area consented the making of the order.

The petitioner has submitted that the impugned order (Y.2) of the Minister is

devoid of legal validity in as much as the Minister has failed to follow the

statutory scheme or procedure set out in section 21(3) of the said Ordinance,

prior to making the impugned order.

It is further submitted, that, in the Statement of Objections, the 1st respondent

(Minister) has not specifically stated as to whether a Regional Physical Plan for

the region where the said land is situated is in operation or not and if such plan

is in operation for the area, the 1st respondent should have submitted it to this

Court. Subject to the term Regional Physical Plan be corrected as a regional

scheme for that region, this submission is right.

8 | C . A . W r i t A p p l i c a t i o n 3 0 8 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a

The process of declaring an urban development area, according to the

Ordinance, therefore, should be as follows,

A regional scheme or Consent of Regional Planning Committee

[Section 21(3)]

Outline Scheme [Section 21(2)(b)]

Urban Development Area [Section 6(2)(b)]

Section 85 defines Regional Planning Scheme as,

regional planning scheme means a planning scheme for any regional

development area or for any land therein;

It appears that the term regional scheme has been interchangeably used with

regional planning scheme.

It defines Outline Scheme as,

outline scheme means an outline planning scheme for any urban

development area or trunk road development area, or for any land in any

such area;

Section 6(2)(b) comes under the Part II, DEVELOPMENT AREAS AND PLANNING

AND EXECUTIVE AUTHORITIES. Section 21 comes under Part III PLANNING

PROCEDURE. Part III begins from section 18 which deals with, Application

for directions to prepare a regional planning scheme. Section 19 is,

9 | C . A . W r i t A p p l i c a t i o n 3 0 8 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a

Application for directions to prepare an outline scheme. Section 20 is

Application for directions to prepare a detailed scheme.

Section 20 subsections (1) and (2) lays down the following procedure,

(1) The planning authority for any urban development area or trunk road

development area may, at any time after an outline scheme for that area or

any land therein has come into operation in accordance with the provisions

of this Part, make application to the Minister to direct the preparation of a

detailed planning scheme for any land to which any provision of that outline

scheme applies.

(2) Notwithstanding that an outline scheme has not come into

operation for any urban development area or trunk road

development area, the planning authority for that area may make

application to the Minister to direct the preparation of a detailed

planning scheme for any land in that area, if the authority is of

opinion that the provisions proposed to be included in the detailed

scheme are urgently necessary for the purpose of-

(a) the regulation of the development of such land; or

(b) the improvement of the locality in which the land is

situated ; or

(c) the preservation of the amenities of the locality in

which the land is situated.

It is thereafter, that, section 21(2)(b) relied upon by the respondents come. But

before that section the section 21(1) becomes material. It is as follows,

10 | C . A . W r i t A p p l i c a t i o n 3 0 8 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a

(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3), the Minister may, on

application made to him in that behalf under the preceding provisions of

this Part, by Order published in the Gazette direct that a regional

planning scheme shall be prepared for any regional development area

or that an outline scheme or a detailed scheme shall be prepared for

the whole or any part of any urban development area or trunk road

development area, as the case may be.

Therefore before section 21(2)(b) there must be regional planning scheme. This

is the same as the limitation in section 21(3) if one looks at the above flowchart.

This regional planning scheme according to section 21(1) must be embodied in

an order published in the Gazette.

What does the Gazette Extra Ordinary bearing No. 1592/13 dated 13.03.2009

relied upon by the respondents and marked as 1R.1 say?

It says,

By virtue of the powers vested in me by section 6(2)(b) and section 21(2)(b)

of the Town and Country Planning Ordinance (Chapter 269) I Dinesh Chandra

Rupasinghe Gunawardena, Minister of Urban Development and Sacred Area

Development, do by this order:-

(a) Declare that the area of land specified in the Schedule hereto shall be

an Urban Development Area for the purpose of the aforesaid Ordinance

and shall be called the Pokunuwita Kithsirimewan Rajamaha Vihara

Sacre Area:; and

(b) Direct that an out line scheme shall be prepared for the whole area

declared to be the Pokunuwita Kithsirimewan Rajamaha Vihara Sacred

Area.

11 | C . A . W r i t A p p l i c a t i o n 3 0 8 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a

Even if it is assumed for a moment, that, what is in (a) the declaration of an

Urban Development Area is permitted under section 6(2)(b), the outline

scheme in (b) above can only be declared under section 21(2)(b), which says,

21(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3), the Minister may, of

his own motion or upon the recommendation of the Central Planning

Commission, by Order published in the Gazette direct-

(b)that an outline scheme shall be prepared for any urban development

area or for any land in such area; or

The document 1R.1 refers to section 21(2)(b) because of its reference in part (b)

of the Gazette to an outline scheme.

But this is subject to section 21(3). Section 21(3) says,

(3) The Minister shall not make an Order directing the preparation of any outline

scheme or detailed scheme for any area or land which is situated in any regional

development area unless a regional scheme for that region has come into

operation, or where no such scheme has come into operation, unless the

Regional Planning Committee for that area consents to the making of the Order.

The term regional scheme has been interchangeably used with regional

planning scheme as section 85 also shows.

Under section 21(1) the regional planning scheme will come into operation

when it is Gazetted.

Therefore, unless 1R.1 also declares a regional planning scheme or it has

reference to a previous Gazette by which a regional planning scheme was

declared, the Minister has no power to declare an Urban Development Area or

an outline scheme.

Section 21(3) specifically says,

12 | C . A . W r i t A p p l i c a t i o n 3 0 8 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a

The Minister shall not make an Order directing the preparation of any

outline scheme or detailed scheme for any area or land which is situated

in any regional development area unless a regional scheme for that

region has come into operation

This is same as regional planning scheme as said above.

Hence without the declaration of a regional scheme or with the consent of the

Regional Planning Committee, if there is such, for that area, the declaration in

Gazette 1R.1 is ultra vires section 21(3) of Town and Country Planning

Ordinance No. 13 of 1946.

The respondents who rely upon 1R.1 have not shown any reason why it should

be otherwise.

In Thirimavithana vs. Urban Development Authority 2010(2) SLR 262, Sisira de

Abrew J., said,

Even if the petitioners have not come to court on the basis that the UDA

had failed to follow the procedure laid down in law, if it is brought to the

notice of court that the respondents have taken decisions after violating

the procedure so laid down and without following the mandatory

requirements, can the court, exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the

decisions made by the Public Bodies, turn a blind eye to such decisions?

The answer is no. If a local authority does not fulfill the requirements of

law, this court will see that it does fulfill them. [Vide Lord Dening MR in

the case of Bradbury and Others vs. Enfield London Borough Council at

1324. What happens when the procedure laid down in law is not followed

by Public Bodies? What is the duty of court when such violations are

brought to the notice of Court? In this connection, I would like to cite the

following passage from the judgment of Danckwerts LJ reported in

Bradburys case (supra) at 1325. It is imperative that the procedure laid

down in the relevant statute should be properly observed. The provisions

of the statute in this respect are supposed to provide safeguards for Her

13 | C . A . W r i t A p p l i c a t i o n 3 0 8 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a

Majestys subjects. Public Bodies and Ministers must be compelled to

observe the law; and it is essential that bureaucracy should be kept in its

place.

Eventhough the respondents in a written submission dated 19.06.2019 has

raised a Preliminary Objection on the basis of delay and presently too in their

written submission has raised the point on laches, the petitioner has clearly

stated that she and her mother came to know about the relevant Gazette when

surveyors of the Surveyors General Department surveyed the land in 2018,

which could be accepted and also not denied (except for saying unaware of) by

respondents. The petitioner has filed this application in 2018 itself and hence

there is no laches.

Therefore, this Court issues a writ in the nature of Certiorari quashing the said

order dated 13th March 2009 made by the then Minister of Urban Development

and Sacred Areas Development published in Gazette 1R.1.

It must be also observed that the said Ordinance does not permit declaration of

sacred areas but only urban development areas. However according to the

wording in 1R.1 one may argue that the words sacred area only came in the

name given to the it, Pokunuwita Kithsirimewan Rajamaha Vihara Sacred Area.

This shows the part the 2nd respondent Rev. Waga Vimalarathana Thero, Vihara

Adhikari, Kithsirimevan Rajamaha Viharaya Pokunuwita played in it. The

petitioner has stated in paragraph 14 of the petition that, To the best of the

petitioners knowledge and information there is no Minister at present in charge

of the subject of Urban Development and Sacred Area DevelopmentThe 01st

respondent is Minister of Western Development and Megapolice as the present

designation go on.

The application is hence allowed with costs.
