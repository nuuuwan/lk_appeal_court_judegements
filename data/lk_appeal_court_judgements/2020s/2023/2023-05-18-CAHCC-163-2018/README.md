MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeal has been filed to set aside the judgment dated

9.10.2018 of the High Court of Kandy.

The accused appellant has been indicted for an offence of statutory rape

under the Penal Code.

The appellant had pleaded not guilty and a trial has been held against

him and upon the conclusion of the same the leaned High Court Judge

had found him guilty for the charge and had sentenced him as follows,

1) a jail term of 15 years, 2) a fine of Rs 10000 in default 2 years rigorous imprisonment, 3) compensation of Rs 100000 in default 3 years RI.

When the matter was taken up for argument the Counsel appearing for

the appellant stated that he is not contesting the conviction but only the

sentence.

The learned DSG appearing for the respondents stated that he is not

objecting for the sentence being backdated.

Upon consideration of the submissions of both parties as the appellant

has already served 5 years of the entire imprisonment imposed on him

this Court is of the opinion that the rigorous imprisonment 15 years

should be reduced to 10 years to be operative from the date of the

conviction and the two default sentences to be reduced to 1 year

imprisonment each and the amount of the fine and the compensation to

remain the same.

Subject to the above the instant appeal is dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
