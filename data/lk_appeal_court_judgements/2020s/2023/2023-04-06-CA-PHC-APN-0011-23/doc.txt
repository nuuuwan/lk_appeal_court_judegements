Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an application in revision by the petitioner on behalf of Kalupanage

Mangalika (hereinafter referred to as the accused) being aggrieved by the order

dated 5th January 2023 by the learned High Court Judge of Colombo. The

accused is presently in remand custody.

We heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner, as well as the learned State

Counsel for the respondent in relation to this application.

The accused has been arrested by the officers of the Colombo Crimes Division

on 22nd June 2021 on the allegation that she had in her possession 102 grams

and 192 milligrams of Heroin. However, according to the Government Analyst

Report, the pure quantity of the said Heroin was 41.81 grams.

The accused had preferred an application for bail under the provisions of the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance to the High Court of Colombo.

The learned High Court Judge of Colombo, being satisfied that the accused had

established sufficient exceptional circumstances which entitled her to be granted

bail, had granted bail to the accused by his order dated 17th February 2022.

The accused had been indicted before the High Court of Colombo by the

indictment dated 05-05-2022 by the Hon. Attorney General for offences in terms

of section 54A of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. The

indictment had been served on the accused on 5th January 2023.

When the indictment was served on the accused, the learned Counsel for the

accused had moved for bail in terms of section 195 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, informing the Court that she is already on bail granted by the

High Court of Colombo. However, it appears from the proceedings, when this

application was made on that day, the learned State Counsel who prosecuted

had objected to the accused being granted bail on the basis that the pure

quantity of Heroin alleged to have been found in the possession of the accused

was 41.8 grams. It had been his position that since the pure quantity of the drug

was more than 10 grams, in terms of Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

(Amendment) Act No. 41 of 2022, it is only the Court of Appeal that can grant

bail under exceptional circumstances. He has urged that since the High Court

has no jurisdiction to grant bail, the accused should be remanded.

It appears that the learned High Court Judge has accepted the said argument

by the learned State Counsel and remanded the accused by his order dated 05-

01-2023.

Page 4 of 7

This Court is in no position to agree with the order by the learned High Court

Judge remanding the accused on the basis that he has no jurisdiction to grant

bail in terms of Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 41

of 2022 in view of the previous order of bail granted to the accused by the same

High Court.

The Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 41 of 2022 has

been certified by the Speaker of Parliament on 23-11-2022. Until then, the law

applicable for granting of bail to a suspect arrested for an alleged offence in terms

of section 54A or 54B of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance

as amended by Act No. 13 of 1994 was in accordance with Section 83 of the

Ordinance.

For matters of clarity, I would now reproduce the relevant Section 83, which

reads thus;

83. (1) no person suspected or accused of an offence under section

54A or section 54B of the Ordinance shall be released on bail, except

by the High Court in exceptional circumstances.

It is clear from the bail order pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of

Colombo in case No-HCEBA/29/22 on 17-02-2022 that, when the said bail order

was pronounced, The Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act

No. 41 of 2022 was not in existence.

Therefore, it is clear that when the accused was indicted before the High Court

of Colombo, she was on a bail order granted in accordance with the law by the

same High Court.

The learned High Court Judge of Colombo has ordered the re-remanding of the

accused on the basis of section 195(d) and apparently after having considered

the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 41 of 2022.

Page 5 of 7

Section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act stipulates the procedure that

should be adopted by a High Court Judge upon receipt of an indictment by the

Court.

Section 195 (d) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads as follows.

195. (d) Subject to the provisions of section 403 direct the accused

to execute a bond to appear in Court for his trial or by warrant

addressed to the superintendent of any prison authorize the

detention of the accused pending trial.

The relevant bail provision considered by the learned High Court Judge in terms

of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 41 of 2022 to

determine that he has no jurisdiction to grant bail reads as follows.

83. (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 84 and 85, a person

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section

54A and section 54B-

(a) of which the pure quantity of the dangerous drug, trafficked,

imported, exported or possessed is ten grammes or above in

terms of the report issued by the Government Analyst under

section 77A; and

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment,

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in

exceptional circumstances.

It is the view of this Court that Section 195(d) does not envisage a situation where

a person already on bail in relation to the alleged offence or offences for which

an indictment has been preferred to the Court can be remanded pending trial.

Section 195 provides for a High Court to order an accused to execute a bond to

appear in Court for his trial if the Court thinks desirable, although such an

accused has already been released on bail by a competent Court. There may be

Page 6 of 7

situations where an accused person has not been granted bail by the time the

indictment is served on the accused. It is on such instances, that the learned

High Court Judge can order detention on that person pending trial until or

unless he is granted bail by a competent Court, if that competent Court is not

the High Court which served the indictment on the accused.

In the instant case, the accused has appeared before the High Court after being

granted bail by a competent Court as stated earlier. Under the circumstances, it

is the view of this Court that it was not open to the prosecuting State Counsel to

make submissions on the basis of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

(Amendment) Act No. 41 of 2022 arguing that the High Court has no jurisdiction

to grant bail. Such an argument can have substance only in a situation where

the accused has not been granted bail, if the pure quantity of the drug was over

ten grams as provided for in the Amendment.

It is the view of this Court that this is common sense more than anything else.

Once a person is granted bail by a competent Court, that person can be

remanded again if any of the bail conditions have been violated by such a person.

It is the view of this Court that since there is no indication that the accused has

violated the bail conditions imposed on her, the learned High Court Judge was

misdirected as to the relevant law when it was ordered that the accused shall be

kept in remand custody and that he has no jurisdiction to grant bail. The

question of jurisdiction to grant bail would not arise in the instant matter.

Accordingly, the order dated 05-01-2023 by the learned High Court Judge of

Colombo where the accused has been remanded is hereby set aside. The learned

High Court Judge is directed to order the release of the accused forthwith on the

bail conditions she has already fulfilled in accordance with the bail order made

on 17-02-2022 by the High Court of Colombo.

The Registrar of the High Court of Colombo is directed to call for the original case

record No. B52348/05/21 from the Magistrate Court of Colombo where the

accused has deposited her bail money and the sureties have entered their bail

Page 7 of 7

bonds and file it along with the High Court case record if it has not been done

as yet for the purposes of relevant action if the accused violates the bail order

made by the High Court.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this order to the High

Court of Colombo for necessary compliance.
