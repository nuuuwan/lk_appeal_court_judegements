JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) with 2nd and 4th accused being indicted in the High Court of

Negombo under the following charge:

On or about 24th of June 2001 at Porutota within the jurisdiction of

High Court of Negombo committed the murder of Mohamed Liyabdeen

Mohamed Thakeebdeen and thereby committed the offence of murder

punishable under Section 296 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

In this case as the 1st Appellant and 2nd and 4th accused absconded the court,

and the trial proceeded in absentia of them after following proper procedures

under Section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979. The

trial commenced before the High Court of Negombo as the 3rd Appellant had

opted for a non-jury trial.

After the conclusion of the prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge

had called for the defence and the 2nd Appellant had made the dock

statement and closed his case. After considering the evidence presented by

both parties, the learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellants and

2nd and 4th accused as charged and sentenced them to death on

09/06/2014.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

All the Learned Counsels for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants had given their consent to argue this matter in their absence due

4 | P a g e

to the Covid 19 pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellants were

connected via Zoom platform from prison.

Background of the Case

This case rests solely on the evidence of sole eyewitnesss testimony.

According to PW2, on the day of the incident, after a gathering at another

house, when he and the deceased were returning home, they had met the

Appellants and the 2nd and 4th accused. The 2nd and 4th accused had held

the deceased while 1st Appellant had shot the deceased from awfully close

range using a small firearm. At that time, the 3rd Appellant had swung a

sword at him, but it missed. As PW2 was threatened not to give evidence, he

ran away from the scene in fear. When he was running, heard another report

of a gunshot. But did not see to whom it was fired.

Before this incident took place, the 1st Appellant had greeted the deceased

and PW2 with Salam and inquired whether a car had gone passing them.

PW2 had very clearly identified the Appellants and 2nd, and the 4th accused

by their names with the aid of light emanating from a nearby light post.

PW9, IP Gunawardena who had gone to the scene of crime immediately after

the incident, witnessed that the deceased was lying on Thakkiya Road close

to a Mosque. He had also noticed the deceaseds head bleeding and two spent

cartridges lying close to the deceaseds body. Further, he had noticed a lamp

post 03 meters away from the deceaseds body. Later, investigation revealed

that the deceased lived in a wooden house situated 27-30 meters away from

the place of incident.

PW16 who conducted the postmortem on the deceased reported that the

gunshot wound to the head was the cause of death.

When the defense was called, the 2nd Appellant had made dock statement

and denied the charge.

5 | P a g e

The following grounds of appeal were advanced by the 1st Appellant.

1. That PW2 the sole eyewitness should not have been believed upon as

he is unworthy of credit.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has not considered the discrepancies

in the evidence of PW2 and not given adequate reasoning or analysis

of the evidence of PW2.

The following grounds of appeal were advanced by the 2nd Appellant.

1. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to take into consideration

the infirmities of the eye witness whose evidence had not been

corroborated.

2. Rejection of the dock statement based on Lucas Principle is wrong in

law.

3. The law relating to evaluation of a dock statement had not been

considered.

4. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider the law relating

to common intention in the judgment.

As the Appeal grounds raised by the Learned Presidents Counsel and the 1st

ground raised by the Counsel for the 2nd Appellant are interconnected, the

said grounds will be considered together hereinafter.

In this case PW2 is the sole eyewitness who had witnessed this unfortunate

incident pertaining to this case. The Appellants and the accused are

personally known to PW2.

The Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance states as follows.

No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for

the proof of any fact.

6 | P a g e

In the case of Sumanasena v. The Attorney General [1999] 3 Sri.L.R 137

held that;

Evidence must not be counted but weighted and the evidence of a single

solitary witness if cogent and impressive could be acted upon by a Court

of Law

In the case of Madduma Siripala and another v. The Attorney General

CA/125-126/10 decided on 27/10/2017, Justice Thurairaja held that:

With reference to the above-mentioned section, there is no requisite

number of witnesses needed to be called to prove a fact. In fact, the

evidence of a single witness is sufficient to prove a fact provided the

evidence of the witness is uncontradicted, truthful, independent, and

reliable to court.

With reference to above cited judicial decisions, it is abundantly clear that

the trial court can act on the evidence of a single witness whose evidence is

truthful and impressive to come to a correct finding.

In this case PW2 had clearly witnessed the incident with the aid of a

streetlight. There is no enmity reported between the witness, the Appellants,

and the accused.

It is the position of PW2 that the deceased was held by 2nd and 4th accused

when the 1st Appellant shot the deceased. At the same time, the 2nd Appellant

had dealt a blow with a sword on PW2, but he escaped from injury. As he

was threatened not to give evidence and directed to run away from the scene,

PW2 had run away from the incident but also went hiding for some time due

to fear. As such he had given his statement to police on the following day. In

7 | P a g e

a criminal trial, delay in recording statement of an eyewitness is not

detrimental when his non-availability is justified.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment had considered the delay in

making the statement to the police. The relevant portion is re-produced

below:

(Page 352 of the brief.)

In the cross examination PW2 confirmed that the incident had happened

close to the deceaseds mothers house. Also admitted that a mosque is

situated in front of the deceased mothers house.

PW2s position is that the 2nd and 4th accused had held the deceased and

facilitated the 1st Appellant to shoot the deceased. But to the police PW2 had

stated that the 1st Appellant and 2nd accused had held the deceased. When

the defence Counsel put this position he had taken when he gave his

statement to the police, PW2 had reiterated that 2nd and 4th accused had

held the deceased when he was shot by 1st Appellant. The Learned

Presidents Counsel highlighting this discrepancy submitted that PW2 is not

a trustworthy witness. This discrepancy had not been marked as a

contradiction during the trial.

In the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa

(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292 held that,

Witnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling discrepancies

and omissions. When contradictions are marked, the Judge should

direct his attention to whether they are material or not and the witness

should be given an opportunity of explaining the matter...The court

8 | P a g e

observed further, that human beings are not computers and that it

would be dangerous to disbelieve the witness and reject evidence based

on small contradictions or discrepancies.

Considering the circumstances under which PW2 had witnessed the

incident, I do not consider this contradiction forceful enough to affect the

outcome of the case.

Although the Learned Presidents Counsel contended that the Learned High

Court Judge has not considered the discrepancies in the evidence of PW2

and not given adequate reasoning or analysis of the evidence of PW2 in the

judgment, the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment had considered

this discrepancy.

Hence, the grounds raised by the Learned Presidents Counsel and 1st ground

raised by the Counsel for the 2nd Appellant have no merit.

In the 2nd ground of appeal, the Counsel for the 2nd Appellant contended that

the rejection of the dock statement based on Lucas Principle is wrong in law.

The Learned Additional Solicitor General admitted that the application of

Lucas Principle is not appropriated in this case. I too agree with both

Counsels. Hence, this ground has merit.

In the third ground of appeal, the Counsel for the 2nd Appellant argued that

the law relating to evaluation of a dock statement had not been considered.

9 | P a g e

Treating unsworn statement of an accused from dock as evidence has been

recognised and consistently followed in our courts despite the fact that

statement not being subjected to cross examination. It has to be treated as

other evidence which had been subjected to cross examination. Acceptance

of dock statement as evidence has been recognised in several land marked

cases in our jurisdiction.

In Kathubdeen v. Republic of Sri Lanka [1998] 3 SLR 10 the court held

that;

It is settled law that an unsworn statement must be treated as

evidence. It has also been laid down that if the unsworn statement

creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case or if it is believed,

then the accused should be given the benefit of that doubt.

Although the law relating to evaluation of a dock statement had not been

considered, in the judgment, the Learned High Court Judge considered the

dock statement of the 2nd Appellant in his judgment. The relevant portion is

re-produced below:

(Page 389 of the brief.)

fkdue;'

Therefore, it is incorrect to argue that the law relating to evaluation of a dock

statement had not been considered in the judgment by the Learned High

Court Judge. Hence, this ground has no merit.

10 | P a g e

In the final ground of appeal, the Counsel for the 2nd Appellant contends that

the Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider the law relating to

common intention in the judgment.

Common Intention is depicted under Section 32 of the Penal Code of

Sri Lanka. It reads:

When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the

common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in

the same manner as if it were done by him alone.

Common Intention implies a pre-arranged plan and acting in concert

pursuant to the plan. Common Intention comes into being prior to the

commission of the act, but a long gap in time need not be present. To bring

this section into effect a pre-concert is not necessary to be proved, but it may

well develop on the spot as between several persons and could be inferred

from the facts and circumstances of each case.

In The Queen v. Mahatun 61 NLR 540 the court held that:

Under section 32 of the Penal Code, when a criminal act is committed

by one of several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all,

each of them is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done

by him alone. If each of several persons commits a different criminal act

each act being in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of them

is liable for each such as if it were done by him alone.

To establish the existence of a common intention it is not essential to

prove that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to a pre-

arranged plan. A common intention can come into existence without pre-

arrangement. It can be formed on the spur of the moment.

11 | P a g e

In S. Fernando v. H. De Silva 68 NLR 166 the court held that:

In order to sustain the charge based on common intention it is essential

that both the accused persons must have participated in the offence, in

the sense that they must be physically present at or about the scene of

offence.

Although the accused did not commit any physical act, yet liability could be

imposed on him on the basis that his presence was a participatory presence.

All these are generally established through circumstantial evidence.

In this case, when 2nd and 4th accused held the deceased, the 1st Appellant

had shot the deceased. At that time, the 2nd Appellant went on to swing the

sword on PW2 which was missed twice. This reiterates that the 2nd Appellant

was an active participant to the crime.

Although the Learned High Court Judge did not discuss the law pertaining

to common intention in the judgment but had considered and satisfied the

participation of the Appellants and the accused in committing the murder of

the deceased. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

(Page 391 of the brief.)

fkdue;s njg ;SrKh lr'

As this has not caused any prejudice to the 2nd Appellant, this ground of

appeal also devoid any merit.

In this case, although the Learned High Court Judge had wrongly used the

Lucas Principle to reject the dock statement of the 2nd Appellant, it has not

caused any prejudice to his right to a fair trial.

12 | P a g e

The evidence presented by the prosecution has clearly established the charge

beyond reasonable doubt against the Appellants. The highlighted

discrepancies are not forceful enough to vitiate the conviction.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that, as there is no merit in the appeal

grounds of the Appellants and therefore their appeals ought to be dismissed.

Hence, I affirm the conviction and the sentence of the Appellants and proceed

to dismiss their appeals.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Negombo along with the original case record.
