ORDER

P.Kumararatnam,J.

The Petitioner filing this Application has invoked the jurisdiction of this

Court to grant bail to her husband who is the Suspect in this case upon

suitable condition as this Court considers appropriate.

The Suspect was arrested on 19.05.2020 by the STF officers and

handed over to the Litigation Unit of the Mount Lavinia Police Station.

He was produced before the Magistrate of Moratuwa in the case bearing

No. B/857/20.

The Suspect was arrested by the STF officers who were at Angulana

Station Road, roadblock set up by them. The Suspect was arrested

when he came to pass the roadblock on his motorbike. When STF

officers checked him found a parcel found from his trouser pocket.

The parcel contained some substances which reacted for Heroin

(Diacetylmorphine). The substance weighed about 50.270 grams.

Further, at the time of his arrest Rs.99000/- was also recovered from

his possession. The Suspect was handed over along with the production

to the Mount Lavinia Police for further investigation and necessary

action.

The Suspect was produced and facts were reported to the Moratuwa

Magistrate under Section 54A (a) and (b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984.

The production had been sent to the Government Analyst Department

and after analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded the report to

the Moratuwa Magistrate Court on 22/12/2020. According to the

Government Analyst, 22.95 grams of pure Heroin (Diacetylmorphine)

had been detected from the substance sent for the analysis.

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in

support of her Revision Application.

1. The Suspect has been in remand custody little more than three

years.

2. The Attorney General has not made an application to the High

Court of the Province to extend the period of detention as

required by Section 84 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Act.

The Learned State Counsel submitted that the delay is not an

exceptional circumstance to be considered to enlarge the suspect on

bail. Further, the time spent for preparing the indictment does not

constitute an exceptional circumstance. According to the State, all

steps has been taken to send out indictment against the Suspect once

the investigation notes are received by the Hon. Attorney General.

The suspect is in remand almost three years. According to Government

Analyst Report the pure quantity of Heroin detected is 22.95grams.

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what

is exceptional circumstances must be considered on its own facts and

circumstances on a case-by-case basis.

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

CA BAIL 16-2023

In CA(PHC)APN 107/2018 decided on 19.03.2019 the court held that

remanding for a period of one year and five months without being

served with the in indictment was considered inter alia in releasing the

suspect on bail. According to the Petitioner, at present her family is

going through untold hardship without proper income and care.

The Section 83 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act

which was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states:

83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under

sections 54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail

by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 84 and 85, a person

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A

and section 54B-

(a) of which the pure quantity of the dangerous drug, trafficked,

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A;

and

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment, shall not

be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in exceptional

circumstances.

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in

exceptional circumstances.

In this case the pure quantity of Heroin detected in the production by

the Government Analyst is 22.95 grams. Hence, this court has

jurisdiction to consider granting of bail as per the new amendment.

CA BAIL 16-2023

6 | P a g e

The Counsel for the Petitioner urged this Court to consider that

detaining a suspect without any legal action for an extended period of

time amounts to a violation of his fundamental rights which can be

considered as an exceptional ground.

The Learned State Counsel has submitted that the investigation dossier

has not been received so far from the Police Narcotics Bureau.

The Government Analyst Report pertaining to this case has been

received by the Magistrate Court of Moratuwa on 22.12.2020. Although

more than one and half years have passed since the receipt of the

Government Analyst Report by the Court, the investigation agency has

failed to submit the relevant investigation dossier to Hon. Attorney

General to consider charges against the Suspect.

Due to inordinate delay in submitting the investigation notes pertaining

to this case to Hon. Attorney General, justice has been denied to the

Suspect. The legal maxim portrait that justice delayed is justice denied.

Although all the steps are important in criminal cases, sending

investigation notes to prosecuting authority is more important among

others. Hence, in a case of this nature or in all cases where the

investigation is over, the prosecuting authority should use their power

in the interest of public, to get down all necessary information to decide

whether a prima facie case could be made out against a suspect who

has been in remand for a considerable period of time. Further, I

consider it is appropriate to call for explanation from the law

enforcement agencies for unreasonable delay in forwarding

investigation notes to the prosecuting authority. Otherwise, the people

will lose trust on the system.

The Learned Magistrate of Moratuwa has rightly called for an

explanation from the Senior Superintendent of Police, under whose

supervision the Mount Lavinia Police Station is coming. Although the

Mount Lavinia Police has reported in writing to the Magistrate on

22.06.2022 that the relevant investigation noted had been dispatched

CA BAIL 16-2023

7 | P a g e

to the Police Narcotics Bureau under reference No. MT/OW/774/2022,

up to date the investigation notes are not received by the Attorney

General.

In Nasher v. Director of Public Prosecution [2020] VSCA 144 the

court held that:

a combination of delay, onerous custodial conditions, and the

relative weakness of the prosecution case may, when considered

with all relevant circumstances, compel the conclusion that

exceptional circumstances have been established. [Emphasis added]

The right to trial without undue delay is found in numerous

international and regional human rights instruments; for example, the

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 14(3)(c), the

American Convention on Human Rights (Article 8(1), the African

Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (Article 7(1)(d), and the

European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and

Fundamental Freedoms (Article 6(1).

When a person is kept in remand without filing charges for a

considerable period of time, he or she should be released on bail

pending indictment. Otherwise, this will lead not only to prison

overcrowding but also violates his or her fundamental rights which

have been guaranteed under the Constitution.

Hence, I consider the delay tittle more than three years in remand falls

into the category of excessive and oppressive delay considering the

circumstances of this case. Hence, considering all the circumstances of

this case, the suspect has very good exceptional circumstances to

CA BAIL 16-2023

consider this application in his favour. Further, remanding a suspect

without filing any charge will prejudice his rights and his family as well.

Offences under Section 54A(a) and 54A(b) of the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is no

doubt serious offences but seriousness of the offence alone cannot form

a ground to refuse bail. In considering these matters, the court must

bear in mind the presumption of innocence.

Further, bail should never be withheld as punishment. Granting of bail

is primarily at the discretion of the Courts. The discretion should be

exercised with due care and caution taking into account the facts and

circumstances of each case.

Considering all these factors into account, especially the pure quantity

of Heroin detected and the circumstances of the case, I consider this an

appropriate case to grant bail to the suspect. Hence, I order the suspect

be granted bail with following strict conditions.

1. Cash bail of Rs.100,000/=.

2. To provide 02 sureties. They must sign a bond of two million

each.

3. The suspect and the sureties must reside in the address given

until conclusion of his case.

4. Not to approach any prosecution witnesses directly or indirectly

or to interfere with.

5. To surrender his passport if any, to court and not to apply for a

travel document. The Controller of the Immigration and

Emigration is informed of the travel ban on the suspect.

6. To report to the Mount Lavinia Police Station on the last Sunday

of every month between 9am to 1pm.

7. Any breach of these conditions is likely to result in the

cancellation of his bail.
