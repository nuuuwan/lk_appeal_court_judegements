I see nothing in the purpose of this clause of the Constitution to indicate that the judges were to be a privileged class, free from bearing their share of the cost of the institution upon which their well-being if not their life depends. We are of the view that the reasoning in the above cases is logical and instructive on the issue of taxes on the salaries of judges. When a tax is applied across the board, as in this case, without directly or indirectly targeting the judges, it cannot be said to be an intrusion into the independence of the Judiciary. Taxes are one of the main revenues generating measures to enhance public finance.
