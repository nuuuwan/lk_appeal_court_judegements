Nayomi Kahawita, SSC for the Respondents.

ARGUED ON : 07.07.2023

DECIDED ON : 08.08.2023

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The petitioner, who was employed as a Management Assistant

(Grade-III) of the Ruhuna University, applied for the post of Assistant

Registrar/Assistant Secretary of the University Grant Commission

(hereinafter referred to as the "UGC"). The petitioner has been called for

a written examination, and the Secretary of the UGC, by his letter dated

13th June 2018 informed the petitioner that she had been successful at

the written examination. The petitioner had obtained 173 marks at the

written examination, as per the examination results sheet marked P-8

with the petition. Thereafter, the petitioner has been called for an

interview by the letter dated 06th July 2018 marked P-9. In the said

letter, it is stated that the marking scheme for the structured interview

is attached to the letter as Annex-1. It is also stated in P-9 that as per

the scheme of recruitment, a minimum of 40% marks should be

obtained in order to consider for an appointment. According to the

marks sheet of the interview (P-18), the petitioner obtained 33.65%, and

thus she was informed that she is unsuccessful at the interview.

Subsequently, the petitioner filed an appeal before the University

Services Appeals Board (hereinafter referred to as "USAB") praying to

set aside the decision made by the 1st respondent, UGC to appoint the

12th to 18th or any other applicants as Assistant Registrars and to

appoint the petitioner as an Assistant Registrar/Assistant Secretary.

After considering the application, as it transpires from the decision

Page 5 of 12

marked P-24, the USAB has dismissed the appeal preferred by the

petitioner.

Being aggrieved by the said decision, the petitioner filed this writ

application seeking the following reliefs.

I. A mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari to quash the

decision made by the 1st respondent UGC to appoint the 16th to

40th as Assistant Registrars/Secretaries of the 1st respondent

UGC.

II. A mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari to quash the order

made in P-24 by the 42nd to 44th respondents of the 41st

respondent, USAB.

III. A mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st

respondent UGC to conduct fresh interviews in terms of the

procedure laid down in P-3 and P-14.

IV. Direct the 9th respondent, the secretary of 1st respondent, UGC

to make available to the court the individual marks sheet used

by the 9th to 15th respondents, the members of the Selection

Committee appointed by the 1st respondent, UGC.

V. A mandate in the nature of Writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st

respondent UGC of calling applications to fill the existing

vacancies for the post of Assistant Registrar/Secretary until the

final determination of this application.

Before dealing with other matters, it is to be noted that a writ of

prohibition cannot be issued until the final determination of the writ

application. Therefore, the prayer (F) (the aforesaid relief V) of the

petition cannot be granted.

It is stated in the statement of objections filed on behalf of the

respondents that the marking scheme, which was duly approved by the

UGC in the year 2016 was used at the interview, and the petitioner was

not selected for the appointment because she had not obtained the

Page 6 of 12

required 40% in the interview. Praying to dismiss the petition, it is

further stated in the statement of objections that the specified correct

procedure has been followed in selecting Assistant Registrars.

The petitioner then filed her counter affidavit. At the hearing of the

application, the learned Counsel for the petitioner and the learned

Senior State Counsel for the Respondents made oral submissions.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner advanced his arguments on the

following grounds.

I. Although it is stated in the letter P-9 that the marking scheme for

the structured interview is attached to P-9, a document (P-10)

containing only the subtopics in the marking scheme for the

structured interview was attached to P-9. As the marking scheme

for the structured interview was not given to the petitioner prior

to the interview, a fair interview was not held, and UGC

contravened the scheme of recruitment and procedure.

II. The Selection Committee had not been properly constituted, the

Selection Committee failed to comply with the procedure followed

in the past and no proper marking scheme had been used.

III. The decision of the USAB to dismiss the petitioners appeal on the

ground that the board has no jurisdiction to intervene is

erroneous. The finding of the USAB that the evaluation process

and the marks given to the petitioner are beyond the expertise of

this Board is illegal and irrational. Thus, the USAB order has

been made in contravention of the provisions in the Universities

Act.

First, I deal with the aforesaid first argument of not giving the marking

scheme to the petitioner prior to the interview. Citing the judgments of

fundamental rights cases, Perera and Nine others v. Monetary Board

of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and Twenty-two Others - (1994)

Page 7 of 12

1 Sri L.R. 152 and Perera and Another v. Cyril Ranatunga,

Secretary Defence and Others - (1993) 1 Sri L.R. 39, the learned

counsel for the petitioner contended that all the criteria relevant to

promotions should be publicized in advance so that all candidates have

equal opportunities of advancing their claims.

Marking scheme which was used for the interview has been produced

marked R-4 with the statement of objections. The learned Senior State

Counsel for the respondents contended that not only the sub-topics

relating to the marking scheme contained in P-10 but also the entire

marking scheme contained in R-4 was sent to the petitioner. In the

letter P-9 that was sent to the petitioner, it is specifically stated that the

marking scheme for the structured interview is attached herewith -

Annex 1. Also, it is stated in P-9, as per the scheme of recruitment,

minimum of 40% marks should be obtained in order to consider you for

an appointment.

The receipt of the letter P-9 has not been disputed by the petitioner. By

perusing the letter P-9, it could be easily understood that in the

marking scheme for the structured interview which is said to have been

annexed with P-9, among other things, it has been referred to the

minimum 40% marks that should be obtained in the interview. The

letter P-10, the petitioner allegedly received does not contain anything

about minimum 40% marks. Therefore, the petitioner could have easily

comprehended that the marking scheme cannot be P-10, which only

contains subtopics for the structured interview. However, at any stage

prior to the interview, the petitioner had not informed the University

Grants Commission that she did not receive the marking scheme for

the structured interview mentioned in P-9. The respondents position is

that they have sent the entire marking scheme with P-9. Respondents

submitted that the same marking scheme used in 2016 and approved

by the 1st respondent Commission was used in 2018, and on the

previous occasion also, the marking scheme was sent to the candidates

Page 8 of 12

prior to the interview with the letter calling for the structured interview,

which also included the written examination results. Hence, there was

no reason to disbelieve that the same marking scheme, which was

marked R-4, had been sent to the petitioner with the letter P-9, as

stated in the said letter. Furthermore, there is no material to accept the

petitioners position taken at the stage of filing this application that she

received only the subtopics of the interview (P-10) because the

petitioner has never complained before that she did not receive the

marking scheme. In the circumstances, this court accepts the position

that the marking scheme had been published prior to the interview and

before the interview, it had been sent to all candidates who were called

for the interview.

Pointing out the columns in the marks sheet, the learned Counsel for

the petitioner further contended that according to the marks sheet of

the interview for the post of Assistant Secretary/Assistant Registrar,

the basis on which the marks were given at the interview is

unreasonable. His contention was that the petitioner should have been

given 40% marks. In the course of his argument, the learned counsel

pointed out that the petitioner obtained 173 marks for the written

examination (P-8), secured 6th place, but for her knowledge of the

subject, she was given 4 marks out of 10 at the interview. As correctly

contended by the learned Senior State Counsel for the respondent,

performing at the interview is different from obtaining marks in the

written examination. According to the examination results sheet

marked P-8, the marks obtained by the petitioner for the English

language is 40. She did the written examination in Sinhala medium.

Considering the way that the petitioner performed in the interview, the

Selection Committee has given her 4 marks out of 10 for subject

knowledge. Therefore, no logical argument could be advanced that the

petitioner should have been given more marks for her knowledge of the

subject because she had obtained 173 marks for the written

examination.

Page 9 of 12

It is to be noted that when there is a written examination and an

interview, the person who obtained the highest marks in the written

examination would not essentially be selected as the first in the

interview. Sometimes the person who obtained the highest marks in the

written examination may be disqualified in the interview. Therefore, the

argument that the petitioner had a legitimate expectation that she

would be selected in the interview has no merit.

Now, I proceed to consider the aforesaid second argument of not

properly constituting the Selection Committee and not following a

proper marking scheme. The learned Counsel for the petitioner

contended that required number of members were not there in the

Selection Committee and even the Chairman was not there.

The document P-18 is the marks sheet of the interview for the post of

Assistant Secretary/Assistant Registrar (Internal Category). P-17 is the

recommendation of the Selection Committee. In P-17, the Selection

Committee recommended 25 candidates who had obtained 40% or

above at the structured interview to be considered for appointment to

the post of Assistant Secretary/Assistant Registrar. This

recommendation of the Selection Committee has been signed by the

Chairman of the UGC and the other six members of the Selection

Committee. Hence, it is evident from P-17 that seven members,

including the chairman of the UGC, conducted the interview and made

the said recommendation. Therefore, the allegation made at the stage

of filing this application that the Selection Committee has not been

properly constituted cannot be accepted because not only there is no

material to accept the said allegation, but also the document P-17 is a

documentary testimony to conclude that the Selection Committee had

been properly constituted.

In substantiating the argument of not following a proper marking

scheme, the learned Counsel for the petitioner drew the attention of the

Page 10 of 12

court to the following portion from the judgement of Perera and Nine

others v. Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and Twenty-

two Others: If persons were appointed in terms of a scheme of

recruitment the scheme must be produced and explained in terms of

the need for the post and the nexus between the work to be performed

and the criteria for selection. If the selections were based on an

examination the marks must be produced, if on interview on a group

basis the marks earned under each criterion of selection must be

produced. If at the interview the marking was on an individual basis

the marks given by each member of the panel to each candidate under

each of the selection criteria should be made available.

In reply to the argument that a proper marking scheme had not been

followed, the learned Senior State Counsel for the respondents

contended that the marking scheme, which was duly approved by the

commission in the year 2016 was used at the interview held in the year

2018 without any amendment, and only in instances where the

marking scheme is changed, it is referred to the 1st respondent for

approval. The said approved marking scheme had been sent to the

candidates and interviews were held. Therefore, I cannot see any

substance in the argument that a proper marking scheme has not been

used at the interview. In addition, the results sheet of the written

examination was published on the web page of the Examination

Department, and the petitioner stated in her petition that she obtained

the results sheet. The same has been marked as P-8 with the petition.

The marks sheet of the structured interview marked P-18 reveals that

the Selection Committee has evaluated the candidates and given marks

at the interview in terms of the marking criteria set out in the marking

scheme. Also, it is evident from document P-17 that the list of qualified

candidates for appointment and the list of not qualified candidates have

been specified separately under the signature of all seven members of

the Selection Committee. Therefore, it is evident that Selection

Committee had been properly constituted. Hence, all requisites

Page 11 of 12

specified in the aforesaid case of Perera and Nine others v. Monetary

Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and Twenty-two Others have

been fulfilled in the interview process in the instant action.

The other argument remains to be considered is that the aforesaid third

argument of dismissing the petitioners appeal by the USAB on the

ground of not having jurisdiction. The learned counsel for the petitioner

contended that dismissing the petitioners appeal is illegal, irrational

and the said order has been made in contravention of the provisions of

the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978.

The section 86(a) of the Universities Act reads as follows:

86. The Appeals Board shall have and may exercise the following

powers, duties and functions:

(a) to conduct investigations into appointments and promotions

alleged to have been made to the staff of the Commission and

to Higher Educational Institutions in contravention of the

schemes of recruitment and the procedures for appointment in

force at the time such appointments or promotions were made

or alleged to have been made and into allegations that

appointments or promotions have not been made to posts when

vacancies have arisen in such posts;

It is apparent from the aforesaid section 86(a), if the appointments and

promotions are made in contravention of the schemes of recruitment

and the procedure for appointment or promotions, the appeals board

can intervene and conduct investigations. According to USAB decision

marked P-24, it is mentioned that We do not observe any illegality that

this board possess jurisdiction to intervene with the evaluation process

and the marks given to the appellant as observed earlier are beyond the

expertise of this board to pronounce upon. It is further stated in P-24

that This board has not been conferred with the jurisdiction in terms

Page 12 of 12

of Section 86 of the Universities Act to set aside an appointment already

made and to make an order substituting another with a fresh

appointment. If there was any illegality in the recruitment process, all

that we could have done was to express our findings but would not have

been able to make an order setting aside an appointment already

made.

It is apparent from the aforesaid findings of the USAB that since they

have not found contravention of the scheme of recruitment and

procedure for appointment, USAB has concluded that they have no

jurisdiction to intervene. For the reasons stated above, I am also of the

view that there was no illegality in the recruitment process and no

contravention of the scheme of recruitment or the procedures for

appointments. Therefore, I hold that the decision of the USAB to

dismiss the petitioners appeal is correct and not illegal or irrational.

For the foregoing reasons, the application for writs of certiorari, the writ

of mandamus and the writ of prohibition prayed for by the petitioner is

dismissed without costs.

Application dismissed.
