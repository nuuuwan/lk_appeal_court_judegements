WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The petitioners have filed this application for writs because a decision

was taken in terms of Proviso (a) to Section 38 of the Land Acquisition

Act as published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2143/54 dated

04.10.2019 to acquire the land where a treatment center, namely,

Nayanmarkaddu Ayurveda Vaidyasalai was situated.

The petitioners have sought a writ of certiorari quashing the notice

issued under Section 04 of the Land Acquisition Act, as well as a writ

of certiorari quashing the Gazette Extraordinary dated 04.10.2019, in

which the Minister of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms directed the

Acquiring Officer to take immediate possession of the land. In addition,

the petitioners have sought a writ of prohibition against the 3rd

respondent, Acquiring Officer, to refrain from acting on the order issued

by the Minister of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms under Proviso (a)

to Section 38 of the Land Acquisition Act.

The statements of objections have been filed on behalf of the

respondents and subsequently, a counter affidavit was also filed. At the

hearing, the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned state

counsel for the respondents made oral submissions.

According to the petitioners, Nayanmarkaddu Ayurveda Vaidyasalai

was originally established nearly 200 years ago as a treatment center

by an ayurvedic doctor known as Dr. Vettinelu. Following the death of

Dr. Vettinelu, Mailvaganam Pandithar and Vettivetpillai

Sivasubramaniampillai, who claimed that the first was the Chief

Manager and the second was the Sub Manager, executed a deed on

11.07.1915, bearing No. 5189, attested by K.S Ramalingam Notary

Public, and took steps to establish the hospital as a trust to ensure its

continuity and future.

As per the judgment of the District Court in the case bearing number

TR.55 marked R-2, the trustees named as defendants of the case were

found to have engaged in misconduct and mismanagement. As a result,

they were removed from their positions and the court directed to submit

a scheme of management. Subsequently, seven persons were appointed

as members of the Board of Trustees for a term of one year,

commencing on 02.05.1983 by an order of the district court dated

29.04.1983.

The petitioners stated in the petition that the 1st petitioner is the

manageress of the said ayurveda hospital, the 2nd petitioner is the chief

occupant of the premises in which the said ayurvedic hospital is

situated and the 3rd petitioner is the mother-in-law of the 1st petitioner

and the mother of the 2nd petitioner.

Stating the history of this treatment center and the events that took

place in respect of this place, the learned counsel for the petitioners

contended that steps were taken to acquire this ayurvedic hospital

without hearing the objections raised by the 3rd petitioner, violating the

procedure stipulated in the Land Acquisition Act.

The learned state counsel for the respondents submitted that the land

in question had been acquired in terms of Section 38A of the Land

4

Acquisition Act as per Gazette Extraordinary 2143/54, dated

04.10.2019, on the ground of urgency, and according to Section 40 of

the Act, when an order of the minister under Section 38 is published in

the Gazette, and where that order is in regard to the taking possession

of a particular land, that land shall, by virtue of that order, vest

absolutely in the State free from all encumbrances with effect from the

date on which that order is so published. Therefore, the learned state

counsel contended that the issue of not giving an opportunity to raise

objections does not arise in this case.

Addressing the issue of whether the petitioners have locus standi to

maintain this application, the learned state counsel submitted the

judgment of the Jaffna district court case No. TR.55, a subsequent

order of the said district court case, dated 29.04.1983, and contended

that the learned District Judge had appointed seven persons as

members of the board of trustees and Doctor A. Umakanthan, through

whom the petitioners purportedly derived standing in this application

was not included in the board of trustees appointed by the District

Court. The learned state counsel contended further that the petitioners

have filed the proposed scheme of management marked X tendered

on behalf of the defendants to the district court and attempted to

demonstrate that Doctor A. Umakanthans name was included in the

board of trustees, which is a misrepresentation of facts, and thus the

petitioners lack locus standi to maintain this application.

At this point, it is vital to consider through whom the petitioners derived

standing in this application. In paragraph 12(l) of the petition, the

petitioners admit that the Supreme Court, in case No. 15/84, declared

"Nayanmarkaddu Ayurveda Vaidyasalai" to be a public trust and

directed that a scheme of management be established for the public

trust. Further, it is stated in the petition that one Dr. Umakanthan was

appointed as the Chief Trustee and Manager of the said

Nayanmarkaddu Ayurveda Vaidyasalai. Furthermore, it is stated in

5

the petition that Dr. Umakanthans appointment was strictly in terms

of the Deed of Trust bearing No. 5189, (marked P-4) the operation of

which still remains valid and so recognized by the said scheme of

management. In paragraph 12(q) of the petition, it is specifically stated

as follows: Dr. Umakanthan died in the year 2002 and his wife the 3rd

petitioner succeeded to the deceased persons rights as trustee and

manager of the said public trust in terms of her hereditary entitlement as

per the Deed No. 5189 and also in terms of the scheme of management

which recognizes the said deed. This is how the petitioners have

become interested parties to maintain this application, according to the

petition. As stated previously, the contention of the learned state

counsel was that this is a misrepresentation of facts and thus the

petitioners lack locus standi to maintain this application.

Before dealing with the aforementioned issue, I wish to address a point

raised in the counter affidavit. In response to the aforementioned

argument of lack of locus standi, in paragraph 9(c) of the counter

affidavit of the petitioners, it is stated that the petitioners state that

there could not have been any gross misrepresentation on the part of the

petitioners for the reason that no document marked X purported to be

the proposed scheme of management was annexed to the petitioners'

affidavit at any time as claimed by the respondents in their statement of

objections. During the hearing also, the learned counsel for the

petitioners stated that they had not filed a document marked "X" and

that the statement of objections contained incorrect facts.

However, when the learned state counsel for the respondents pointed

out that the petitioners had in fact filed the proposed scheme of

management marked as X, the learned counsel for the petitioners

admitted that a document had been filed as X on behalf of the

petitioners.

6

The vital matter that arises from the said document marked X was

that it was only a proposed scheme of management tendered to the

district court of Jaffna on behalf of the defendants. However, it is

evident from the order of the district court, dated 29.04.1983 (one of

the documents pertaining to R-1), that Dr. A Umakanthan has not been

appointed as a member of the Board of Trustees by the said order of the

district court and some other seven persons have been appointed as the

board of trustees. Dr. A Umakanthans name had only been mentioned

in the proposed scheme of management submitted by the defendants.

Therefore, the assertion of the petitioners that Dr. Umakanthan was

appointed as the Chief Trustee and Manager of the "Nayanmarkaddu

Ayurveda Vaidyasalai" in the petition is a total misrepresentation of the

facts, as contended by the learned state counsel because the district

court did not appoint Dr. Umakanthan as a member of the board of

trustees.

Apart from that, explaining how the petitioners derived standing to

institute this application for writs, the petitioners claim that after the

death of Dr. Umakanthan, his wife, the 3rd petitioner, succeeded to the

deceased persons rights as trustee and manager of the said public

trust. In the circumstances that Dr. Umakanthan was not a member

of the board of trustees, the said claim is also a misrepresentation of a

material fact.

The aforesaid facts reflect a total lack of uberima fides on the part of

the petitioners. In the order of the district court, dated 29.04.1983, in

which the board of trustees was appointed, it is mentioned that All

properties of this institution shall vest in the Board of Trustees. The

Board of Trustees should generally conduct themselves as the Board of

Directors of a public limited liability company subject however to

periodic directions by Court. The Board of Trustees shall have full

power to collect and safeguard the properties of the trust. Therefore, it

is apparent that the management of the Ayurvedic hospital as well as

7

its properties were vested with the board of trustees, to which the

petitioners had no connection. In the circumstances, it appears that the

petitioners have misrepresented the material facts to this court in the

aforesaid manner in order to create a link to the trusteeship of the

public trust. Without creating such a link, the petitioners have no

acceptable basis to state that one of them is the manageress of the said

Ayurveda Hospital at present, another petitioner is the chief occupant

of the premises at present, and after the death of Dr. Umakanthan, his

wife, the 3rd petitioner, succeeded to the deceased persons rights as

trustee and manager of the said public trust.

It is stated in the case of The State Graphite Corporation v.

Fernando and Another- (1981) 2 Sri L.R 401 at page 415 as follows:

As Pathirana J held in the case of Alphonso Appuhamy v.

Hettiarachchi - (1973) 77 NLR 131, if a party who moves for a

prerogative writ fails to disclose material evidence and so is wanting

in uberrima fides, the Court will not grant him relief. As the petitioner

has failed to disclose facts material to its application, the Court will not

in any event grant and issue the writ it prays for - see also De Smith:

Judicial Review of Administrative Action (1980) 4th Ed. P. 576.

In the case at hand, the petitioners statements that Dr. Umakanthan

was appointed as the chief trustee and manager of the said

Nayanmarkaddu Ayurveda Vaidyasalai and that upon his death, his

wife, the 3rd petitioner, succeeded to the deceased persons rights as

trustee and manager of the said public trust, are misrepresentations of

most fundamental and material facts required to determine this case.

In Hulangamuwa v. Siriwardena and Others (1986) 1 Sri L.R. 275

it was held that a petitioner who seeks relief by writ which is an

extraordinary remedy must in fairness to this court, bare every material

fact so that the discretion of this court is not wrongly invoked or

exercised. For not disclosing the fact that the petitioner had a

8

resident at Dehiwala, it was held that on this ground too the application

must be dismissed for lack of uberima fides.

In Laub v. Attorney General and Another- (1995) 2 Sri. L.R. 88, the

petitioner had not acted with uberima fides, he had suppressed material

facts and it was held that the application could be dismissed in limine.

After carefully considering the facts presented in this case, it is clear

that the petitioners misrepresented the most important and material

facts in this case. After establishing a trust, the petitioners appear to

lack authority over the hospital. Misrepresenting facts, the petitioners

stated that Dr. Umakanthan was appointed to the board of trustees and

that upon his death, his wife, the 3rd petitioner, succeeded to his rights

as trustee and manager of the said public trust. Petitioners claim that

the 1st petitioner is presently the manageress of the said ayurveda

hospital, and that the 2nd petitioner is the chief occupant of the hospital

premises could not be accepted because after establishing the trust

pursuant to the order made by the Court, the management of the

hospital and the properties of the hospital were vested with the board

of trustees and even the petitioners do not say that the management of

the hospital by the trust has ever changed. In considering the way that

the most important facts have been misrepresented in this case, I am

of the view that it is not necessary to go into the other issues relating

to this application because the petitioners have laid the foundation to

maintain this application by misrepresenting material facts. It is settled

law that, on the basis of the suppression or misrepresentation of

material facts alone, an application for writ could be dismissed.

It should be noted that it is essential to maintain the highest standards

of honesty and transparency by all parties in legal proceedings to

ensure that justice is served fairly and equitably. On careful

consideration of the facts of this case, I hold that the application for

writs be dismissed without considering the other facts of the application

9

on the ground of a lack of "uberrima fides", or the lack of utmost good

faith of the petitioners.

Accordingly, the application for writs is dismissed with costs fixed at

Rs. 60,000/-.
