Under Section 106 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, the taxpayer was required to file the return of income on or before the 30th day of September immediately succeeding the end of that year of assessment. Accordingly, if the Assessor does not accept the return and proceeds to make an assessment, the Assessor has to make the assessment on or before the 30th of September 2009, after the expiry of eighteen months from the end of the year of assessment. Accordingly, the taxpayer filed the return within the prescribed time frame. In this instance before the 30th September 2008. Subsequently, by Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 19 of 2009, the Legislature extended the period for a taxpayer to file a return by two months, until 30th November 2008, and the time period for the Assessor to make an assessment by six months, until 31st of March 2010. By the time the taxpayer has already submitted his return before the 30th day of September, under Section 106 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, the principal Act. However, the Assessor made his assessment on the 26th March 2010, pursuant to Section 163 (5) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, as amended by amendment Act No. 19 of 2009 which was brought into operation with effect from 31st March 2009. As regards Section 27 of Amendment Act No 19 of 2009, certain Sections have retrospective effect as of the dates set out therein, but Section 163 (5) is not included. The Court of Appeal held that Section 163 (5) being a procedural law the amendment to the said Section has a retrospective effect and the taxpayer does not have a vested right in having his assessment made under the law on which he filed his return and therefore, the assessment is not time-barred.",

Consequently, His Lordship held that the amendments made to Sections 106 (1) and 163 (5) (a) by amendment Act No. 19 of 2009 have no application to the year of assessment 2007/2008. Therefore, the opinion expressed by the Supreme Court was based on the fact that the acts to be performed under these sections are linked to the year of assessment.

She relied on the following observations made by the Supreme Court the law should not be interpreted to give an advantage to an assessor and deprive a taxpayer. Article 12 (1) of the Constitution states that all persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law. Hence, the amendments made to section 163 (5) (a) read with section 106 (1) of the principal Act should be interpreted to secure the rights of both taxpayers and assessors of the Department of Inland Revenue. However, in my view, this is only a passing remark in the judgment and therefore, an obiter dictum. The ratio decidendi is on the interpretation of Section 27 of the Amending Act.

Country of Merced22 that the above two judgments affirm the position that goods which have entered the stream of export are in fact exports. Accordingly, it was contended that lubricants that enter the bonded warehouses have entered the export stream and must not be denied tax exemptions given to the exports under the Inland Revenue Act. However, as I have already stated elsewhere in this judgment, petroleum products are imported to Sri Lanka and kept in bonded warehouses until supplied to the ships. Any other product exported from Sri Lanka will enter the bonded warehouses once those are ready to be exported. Accordingly, like any other product, lubricants kept in the bonded warehouses cannot be considered to have entered the stream of export. The Legislature itself has recognized petroleum gas or petroleum products as a product exported from Sri Lanka23. Being a country, which does not have petroleum resources, it is obvious that the export of petroleum products referred to in Section 42 (1) (b) has to be petroleum products imported and re-exported. However, it is a known factor that Sri Lanka does not re-export petroleum products to other countries. Therefore, invariably, the export meant by section 42 (1) (b) has to be the supplies made to ships and/or air crafts etc.",

Official documents such as the Customs Declaration Form (CUSDEC), Marine Delivery Notes, and Commercial Invoices etc., where the place of destination is stated, are relevant in determining whether the ship is going out of Sri Lanka to a foreign destination or not. The ship/vessel being a non-resident ship/vessel should not be the test in determining this fact, since, there may be non-resident ships, registered in a foreign country, providing services within the Sri Lankan territory. However, it is unfortunate that in the case at hand, none of these documents were produced. It appears that even the Respondent, the CGIR, has not taken any step under Section 215 of the Inland Revenue Act to search for these documents. Nevertheless, since the Appellant is claiming a tax exemption in this case, the burden lies on the Appellant to establish its eligibility for the exemption.",

    "text": "Furthermore, it is my considered opinion that the export of bunker fuel, which would be consumed by a ship during its journey, is different from the traditional export of cargo where the goods are exported to a specified recipient in an overseas destination. Another perspective argument is that the intention of the Legislature in introducing the legislative provisions relevant to this case is not fiscal, but economic, and was to increase foreign reserves by encouraging export, which in return brings in foreign exchange. Therefore, the Appellants sale of marine bunker fuel, a transaction in foreign currency, constitutes an export. However, in my view, this may be one of several criteria which could be taken into consideration in deciding whether a transaction is an export or not but, not the decisive factor. There may be many more local transactions done in foreign currency that would not constitute an export. The TAC arrived at the conclusion that the Appellants sale of marine bunker fuel to foreign vessels cannot be treated as an export and therefore, the Appellant is not entitled to the concessionary tax rates under Sections 42 and 51 of the Inland Revenue Act, as amended, on the ground that the goods need to have a foreign destination necessitating an importer; export and import need to go in pairs. However, this Court is of a different opinion on the above issue, and as stated above in this judgment the test is whether the marine bunker fuel is supplied to ships leaving the Sri Lankan territory to a foreign destination.",
