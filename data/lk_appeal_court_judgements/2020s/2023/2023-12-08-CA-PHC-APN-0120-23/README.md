ORDER

P.Kumararatnam,J.

The Accused-Appellant-Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as

the Petitioner) had filed this Revision Application to revise the order of

Learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya delivered in HCB 37/2023.

The Petitioner was the Accused in the High Court of Embilipitiya Case

No.HCE 28/2021.In the said case the Petitioner was indicted for

committing offence (two counts) under Section 365(b)2(b) of the Penal

Code.

After trial the Petitioner was convicted for both charges and sentenced

on 11.05.2023 as follows:

1st Count

10 years RI and a fine of Rs.10,000/-. In default 12 months simple

imprisonment.

CA PHC APN 120-2023

2nd Count

10 years RI and a fine of Rs.10,000/-. In default 12 months simple

imprisonment.

A compensation of Rs.100, 000/- is to be paid to PW1. In default 6

months RI. Also ordered the both jail sentence to concurrent to each

other.

The Petitioner states that upon being aggrieved by the said conviction

and the sentence he had preferred an appeal to this case.

In the meantime, filling the Petition of Appeal, the Petitioner made an

application for bail pending appeal to the High Court of Embilipitiya by

way of a Petition and supportive affidavit dated 05.06.2023 in terms of

Section 20(2) of the Bail Act No.30 of 1997.

The Learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya delivering his bail order

dated 14.09.2023 has refused to enlarge the Petitioner on bail on the

sole reason that the Petitioner has failed prove any exceptional

circumstances which warrant granting of bail to the Petitioner.

The Petitioner states that due to following reasons the findings of the

Learned High Court Judge are illegal, wrongful and contrary to law.

a) The said order is contrary to law.

b) The Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself when he

held that there were no exceptional circumstances averred by

the Petitioner whereas the matters set out in the Petition

amounted to exceptional circumstances within the law.

c) The Learned High Court Judge erred in law when he refused to

enlarge the Petitioner on bail pending appeal in as much as the

continuous incarceration of the Petitioner in the circumstances

of this case would endanger his life and that would amount to

exceptional circumstances.

CA PHC APN 120-2023

It is a settled principle that release on bail pending appeal to the Court

of Appeal will only be granted in exceptional circumstances.

In King vs. Keerala 48 N.L.R. 202, Wijewardana J. held,

the Court of Criminal Appeal does not grant applications for bail in

the absence of exceptional circumstances.

In The Queen vs. B. Rupasingha Perera 62 N.L.R.238, Basnayake C.J.

with Sansoni J. held,

bail is not granted by the Court of Appeal unless there are

exceptional circumstances.

In, The Queen vs. Koranelis Silva 74 N.L.R. 113, Weeramanthri J.

held,

release on bail pending appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal will

only be granted in exceptional circumstances.

In an application of this nature, the bail only be granted upon

successful submission that the Accused has an exceptional ground.

Further the bail should not be granted as a right for a person who was

convicted by a competent court.

As per the letter issued by the Consultant Cardiologist Dr. M.Niraj, the

Petitioner has been diagnosed with Myocardial Infarction in the past.

For this illness the Petitioner is under Cardiology Clinic follow up at

District Hospital Embilipitiya since 26.08.2020 and his last clinic date

was on 10.03.2023.

CA PHC APN 120-2023

The Learned High Court Judge in his well-considered order considered

the heath condition of the Petitioner very extensively and given reasons

as to why he refused the application for bail pending appeal of the

Petitioner. Further, the Learned High Court Judge had directed the

Registrar of Embilipitiya High Court to inform that the Petitioner should

be sent for necessary treatments and if the doctor recommends, the

Petitioner should be taken to the recommended hospital/s for necessary

clinics.

Hence, considering the seriousness of the offence and the punishment

imposed on the Petitioner by the Learned High Court Judge, I consider

this is not an appropriate case to issue notice to the Respondents. The

only remedy available to the Petitioner would be to make an application

before the Court to fix the main appeal to an early date considering the

circumstances of this case.

Hence, we refuse notice in this case.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this order to the

High Court of Embilipitiya for information.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

SAMPATH B. ABAYAKOON, J.

I agree.
