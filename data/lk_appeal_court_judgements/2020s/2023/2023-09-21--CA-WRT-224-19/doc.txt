The petitioner has filed this writ application seeking inter alia following

reliefs:

1. A writ of certiorari quashing the determination and/or decision

of the 1st to 11th Respondents and/or those acting under or on

their behalf to:

i. Placing the petitioner under retirement and/or

mandatory retirement as reflected in communication

dated 10th September 2018 marked P-11

Page 5 of 14

ii. Restraining the petitioner from his due promotion to the

rank of Lieutenant Colonel with effect from 27/09/2012

as contemplated in communication dated 10th September

2018 marked P-11

2. A writ of certiorari quashing the proceedings and/or purported

findings of the interview Board 02 conducted by the 4th to 11th

Respondents in respect of petitioners promotion as reflected in

communication marked P-11 referred above.

3. A writ of mandamus compelling the 1st to 11th Respondents

and/or those officers acting under their authority to grant the

petitioner his due promotion to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel

with effect from 27/09/2012 together with such back-wages and

his consequential allowances, privileges and emoluments

rightfully due to him.

4. Writ of prohibition restraining the 1st to 11th respondents and/or

any one or more of them and/or those officers acting under their

authority from giving effect to the impugned decision reflected in

the communication marked P-11 retiring, discharging or

removing the petitioner from Sri Lanka Army without promoting

to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel with effect from 27/09/2012.

Briefly, the facts relating to this application are as follows:

Petitioner first enlisted in the Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as SLAVF) as an Officer Cadet and

was commissioned as a Second lieutenant in December 1992.

Thereafter, he received promotion as a Lieutenant on 19th December

1995, as a Captain on 19th December 1998, as a Major on 23rd May

2005, as a Commanding Officer in 29th July 2010 and as a Selected

Page 6 of 14

Major on 23rd June 2015. The petitioner is currently serving in the

aforesaid rank of "Selected Major".

The petitioner has detailed in his petition a number of achievements

and appreciations he had received, including the "Ranashura Medal"

for his exceptional performance and conduct in the service. Accordingly,

the petitioner states that he is entitled to a clean track record during

the period of 26 years of his service, except on four occasions where he

had been punished with admonition/reprimand/severe reprimand as

far back as 1995, 2001, and 2003 for obtaining leave without approval.

The petitioner has stated that, as a Selected Major, he had been facing

interview boards in 2016 and 2017, expecting due promotion to the

rank of Lieutenant Colonel, but he was not promoted. According to the

petitioner, after making several requests in 2018, upon succeeding the

preliminary interview, the petitioner was called for an interview on 24th

of July 2018 by the Interview Board No. 2 of SLAVF for an appointment

to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. The petitioner complains that instead

of considering his suitability and eligibility to be appointed to the rank

of Lieutenant Colonel as per Sections 16 and 17 of the Sri Lanka Army

Act and the Voluntary Force Regulation 1985 published in Gazette

Notification No.476/26 dated 20/10/1987, after the interview, it has

been ordered to send him on compulsory retirement after a period of

one year with effect from 8th August 2018. He was communicated of the

said recommendation/decision by the letter dated 10.09.2018, marked

"P-11". It is against the said P-11 that writs of certiorari, writ of

mandamus and writ of prohibition have been sought in prayers (b) i &

ii, (c), (d) and (e).

The Statement of Objections asserts that the petitioner has no clean

record, that he was absent without leave on two occasions, and that

warning letters were issued to him on both instances. Furthermore, it

is claimed on behalf of the respondents that officers in the Sri Lanka

Page 7 of 14

Army are not entitled to be promoted as of right. It is also specified that

officers who have been absent without leave being approved would not

be considered for promotion to the Rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

At the hearing of this application, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner

and the Learned Additional Solicitor General for the Respondents made

oral submissions. After the hearing, parties were allowed to file written

submissions along with the relevant judicial authorities but none of the

parties filed written submissions or any judicial authority. The Learned

Additional Solicitor General confined his arguments to the issue of

maintainability of this application and contended that the reliefs prayed

for by the petitioner are futile and thus this application could not be

maintained.

Before going into the merits of this application, the objection regarding

the maintainability of the application must be addressed, because if the

application cannot be maintained, going into the merits of the case is

purposeless.

The main contention of the Learned Additional Solicitor General was

that, according to the journal entry dated 01.04.2021, the Learned

Counsel for the Petitioner had moved to fix the matter for support only

with regard to the relief mentioned in prayer (d) of the petition. The

Learned Additional Solicitor General also contended that according to

Section 10 of the Army Act, His Excellency the President of the Republic

of Sri Lanka has the authority to grant promotions to commissioned

officers of the Sri Lanka Army, and in terms of Article 35(1) of the

Constitution, His Excellency the President has immunity from suit in

any court or tribunal in the country.

The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner contended that after the 1st of

April 2021, on the 24th of January 2022, the Court allowed the

petitioner to confine this matter only to the prayers "(a)", "(b) ii", "(c)"

Page 8 of 14

and "(d)" of the petition dated 07.06.2019. The Learned Counsel

contended further that on the said day, the Learned Additional Solicitor

General appeared for the respondents and he had not raised any

objection. She contended further that; therefore, the petitioner is

entitled to maintain this application for the reliefs "(a)", "(b) ii", "(c)" and

"(d)" prayed for in the petition.

It is reflected from the journal entry dated 18.07.2019 that an

undertaking was given to the court on behalf of the respondents that

no action would be taken to enforce the decision contained in P-11 and

that no step connected with or ancillary to P-11 will be taken by the Sri

Lanka Army and that the current status qua pertaining to the

employment of the petitioner in the Sri Lanka Army will be maintained

till the date on which this matter is in fact supported by the counsel for

the petitioner.

The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner contended that the matter was

supported on 14.03.2022 but before the said date, the respondents

issued the decision R-3 on 22.05.2020 violating the undertaking given

to the court.

Among the decisions contained in R-3, the decision pertaining to the

petitioner is that the board recommended the petitioner and nine other

officers in the Rank of Major to be retired upon reaching the age of 55

years, and the board did not recommend those ten officers be promoted

to the Rank of Temporary Lieutenant Colonel. The reason for not

recommending the petitioner for the promotion has been stated as

"absent without leave and past poor discipline".

In considering the recommendations stated in R-3 in respect of the

petitioner, it appears that there is no violation of the undertaking given

by the respondents to the Court for the following reasons:

Page 9 of 14

On 18.07.2019, the undertaking to the Court was that no steps would

be taken on P-11. The letter P-11 reads as follows:

The Army Bd No 02 assembled on 24 July 2018 had examined the

SLAVF Bd proceedings and stipulated criteria with regard to the

Promotion to the rank of T/Lt Col and determining their career

progression. The Bd having perused your records, had

recommended you to be retired from the SLAVF after a period of 01

year with effect from 08 August 2018.

It is brought to your information that the Commander of the Army

has approved the above recommendation made by the Army Bd No

02.

If the petitioner was not allowed to serve in the army after 08th of August

2018, that would be a violation of the undertaking given to the Courts

on 18.07.2019. However, the said decision was not carried out, instead,

the petitioner was allowed to serve until the 29th of November 2027 by

issuing letter R-3. It is very clear from the journal entry dated

01.04.2021, that the Learned Additional Solicitor General informed the

Court on that day that the Sri Lanka Army would not proceed with the

letter marked P-11. The recommendation contained in letter P-11 is for

the petitioner to be retired from the SLAVF after a period of one year

with effect from 08 August 2018. So, the said recommendation was not

carried out as per the undertaking given to the Courts.

In addition, it transpires from the same journal entry that the petitioner

not only accepted the said proposal, but also moved to proceed only

with the relief prayed for in prayer (d) in his petition. It is precisely clear

that the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner decided to proceed only with

the relief prayed for in the prayer (d) accepting the position that the

respondents had not acted on P-11 as per the undertaking given to the

Court.

Page 10 of 14

The contention of the Learned Additional Solicitor General was also that

they withdrew P-11 and now only R-3 is in force. He contended further

that in the said circumstances, the petitioner cannot maintain the

reliefs sought in the petition based on P-11. The reply of the Learned

Counsel for the Petitioner was that P-11 contains not only the date of

retirement, but also the matters regarding the promotion.

It is correct that in P-11, it is stated that the Army Board No. 2

assembled to examine the promotion to the Rank of Lieutenant Colonel,

but the Board had only made the recommendation that the petitioner

be retired from 08th August 2018 and it is also stated that the

Commander of Army has approved the said recommendation. However,

reasons for not giving the promotion or any other matter relating to the

promotion has not been mentioned in P-11. So, the status quo

pertaining to the employment of the petitioner had been maintained till

the date on which the matter was supported as per the undertaking

given to the Court by the respondents on 18.07.2019. In addition, the

status quo pertaining to the employment of the petitioner was not

changed by R-3. As per the undertaking given to the Court, the

recommendation contained in P-11 was not enforced, and as a result,

the petitioner did not have to get retired on 8th August 2018 as it was

mentioned in P-11.

Anyhow, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner informed the Court on

24.01.2022 that she would confine the matter to the prayers "(a),

"(b)ii", "(c)" and "(d)" of the petition. The learned Additional Solicitor

General for the respondents invited this Court to observe the conduct

of the petitioner, pointing out the fact that the petitioner moved only to

proceed with the prayer (d) on 01.04.2021 and then moved to proceed

with the prayers "(a)", "(b)ii", "(c)" and "(d)" on 24.01.2022.

Page 11 of 14

Anyhow, since the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner informed the

Court subsequently that she would confine the matter only to the

prayers (a), (b)ii, (c) and (d) and this Court allowed the said

application in the absence of any objection from the respondents, I hold

that this application could be maintained for the reliefs prayed for in

the prayers (a), (b) ii, (c) and (d).

Now, I proceed to consider the above reliefs prayed for by the petitioner.

Consideration of prayer (a) is not required now, because that is

regarding the issuing of notice to the respondents. Prayer (b)ii is based

on P-11, and the relief prayed for is a writ of certiorari quashing the

determination and/or decision of the 1st to 11th Respondents and/or

those acting under or on their behalf restraining the petitioner from his

due promotion to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel with effect from

27/09/2012 as contemplated in communication dated 10th September

2018 marked "P-11".

According to prayer b(ii), it indicates that P-11 contemplates a

determination or decision restraining the petitioner from his due

promotion to the Rank of Lieutenant Colonel with effect from

27.09.2012. It is apparent from P-11 that there is no such decision,

determination, or even a recommendation that restrains the petitioners

promotion with effect from 27.09.2012.

P-11 states that the Board examined SLAVF Board proceedings and

stipulated criteria with regard to the promotion. Then it was

recommended that the petitioner be retired from the SLAVF after a

period of one year, with effect from 08th August 2018. That indicates

that the Board was not inclined to give the promotion, although it is not

stated specifically in P-11 about the promotion. However, it is precisely

clear that there is no decision or determination contained in P-11 to the

effect that the petitioner is being denied from promoting with effect from

27.09.2012. As there is no such decision or determination in prayer

Page 12 of 14

(b)ii, the application cannot be maintained for the relief prayed for in

prayer (b)ii of the petition.

The prayer (c) to the petition reads as follows:

A writ of certiorari quashing the proceedings and/or purported

findings of the Interview Board 02 conducted by the 4th to 11th

Respondents in respect of petitioners promotion as reflected in

communication marked P-11 referred above.

The Learned Additional Solicitor General for the Respondents

submitted that the respondents have withdrawn P-11. It is apparent

from the conduct of the respondents also that they have withdrawn

P-11 because the petitioner did not have to retire from 08.08.2018,

instead the petitioner was allowed to serve until 29.11.2027 as stated

in R-3. The said decision was informed to the Court on 01.04.2021 and

the petitioner accepted the said extension of service and reserved his

rights only to pursue with the relief prayed for in prayer (d) in respect

of his promotion. In the aforesaid circumstances, asking to quash P-11

is now a futile exercise. Therefore, I hold that the petitioner cannot

maintain this application for the relief prayed for in prayer (c) of the

petition as well.

The only other prayer that the learned Counsel for the Petitioner moved

to proceed with is prayer (d) of the petition. The prayer (d) of the petition

reads as follows:

A Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st to 11th Respondents

and/or those officers acting under their authority to grant the

Petitioner in his due promotion to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel

effect from 27/09/2012 together with such back-wages together

with his consequential allowances, privileges and emoluments

rightfully due to him.

Page 13 of 14

The contention of the Learned Additional Solicitor General was that

because of the immunity of the President, the petitioner cannot canvass

this promotion by way of a writ application. The reply of the Learned

Counsel for the Petitioner was that the President is not the sole

authority of granting the promotion, and all recommendations are made

by the relevant army officials.

It is correct that the evaluation of the past records of the petitioner and

making recommendations are done by the relevant army officials, but

Section 9 of the Army Act specifically states that the officers shall be

appointed by the President of the country. Section 9 and Section 10 of

the Army Act read as follows:

9 (1). The officers shall be appointed by commissions under the hand

of the President.

(2). Every officer shall upon appointment take and subscribe the

prescribed oath, or make and subscribe the prescribed

affirmation, before a prescribed officer.

(3). No commission issued by the President under subsection (1) of

this section shall become invalid by reason of his death or vacation

of office.

10. Every officer shall hold his appointment during the President's

pleasure.

It is clear from the above sections that the officers in the Army are

appointed by the President, and such officers can hold the office at the

Presidents pleasure. Hence, other than the President, no other person

can make the appointments of the officers. In the instant application

also, it is apparent that the appointment of Lieutenant Colonel could

only be given by the President.

Page 14 of 14

What has been prayed for in prayer (d) is a Writ of Mandamus

compelling the 1st to 11th respondents and/or those officers acting

under their authority to grant the petitioner his due promotion to the

Rank of Lieutenant Colonel with effect from 27.09.2012.

As the appointment of Lieutenant Colonel could only be given by the

President and the 1st to 11th respondents do not have authority to

appoint the petitioner or to give him a promotion to the rank of

Lieutenant Colonel as explained above, the petitioner cannot maintain

the application for writ of mandamus compelling the 1st to 11th

respondents to appoint the petitioner to the Rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

Therefore, the relief prayed for in prayer (d) of the petition also cannot

be maintained.

For the reasons stated above, I hold that the application for writs prayed

for in prayers (b)ii, (c), and (d) could not be maintained.

Accordingly, the application for writs prayed for by the petitioner is

dismissed without costs.
