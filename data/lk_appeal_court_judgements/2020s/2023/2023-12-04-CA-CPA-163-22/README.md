Argued on : 14-09-2023

Decided on : 04-12-2023

Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an application by the complainant-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as

the petitioner) invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court granted in terms

of Article 138 of The Constitution.

The petitioner being the Attorney General of The Democratic Socialist Republic

of Sri Lanka, is seeking to challenge the order made on 05-04-2022 by the

learned High Court Judge of Colombo, wherein, the accused-respondent who

was indicted before the High Court of Colombo in case No. HC/1855/20 was

discharged.

When this matter came up for notice, this after having considered the petition,

affidavit, the documents tendered and the submissions of the learned Senior

Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) decided to issue notice along with the relevant

documents to the accused-respondent mentioned. The notices were issued for

the 1st time under registered post article number 6820 on 21-04-2023 and again

under registered post article number 8095 on 26-06-2023, giving notice of this

application to the accused-respondent. None of the notices have been returned

to the Court on the basis that it could not be served on the accused-respondent.

The accused-respondent did not appear before the Court, and it was decided to

hear the matter as it appeared clear to this Court that the accused-respondent

is not interested in appearing before the Court.

At the hearing of this application, the learned SDSG submitted that there was

no basis whatsoever for the learned High Court Judge to discharge the accused-

Page 3 of 15

respondent (hereinafter referred to as the respondent) on the 1st day fixed for the

summons returnable on the prosecution witness number 01 on the given basis

of the order pronounced by the learned High Court Judge.

He contended that 05-04-2022 was the date 1st fixed for the trial, and the learned

State Counsel who prosecuted informed the Court that the summons had not

been served on PW-01, and despite the application before the learned High Court

Judge to refix the matter and reissue the summons on PW-01, the learned High

Court Judge proceeded to discharge the respondent by the impugned order.

He was of the view that knowing very well that there is no provision under the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act to discharge an accused at that stage of the trial,

the learned High Court Judge giving a wrong interpretation to the relevant

statute and being misdirected as to the Judgements considered, to substantiate

his order, discharged the respondent.

He cited the decided case of Attorney General Vs. Sumathipala (2006) 2 SLR

126 to argue that the learned High Court Judge was not empowered to create

laws that are not in existent, and moved that the revision application by the

petitioner be allowed and the relief sought in the petition granted.

The facts which led to the impugned order by the learned High Court Judge of

Colombo as revealed during the hearing of this application can be summarized

as follows.

The petitioner being the Attorney General of the country has filed an indictment

under case number HC/1855/2020 before the High Court of Colombo naming

the respondent as the accused for committing the following offence.

1. That between 01-01-2015 to 31-12-2015, the accused knowing

that his service has been terminated as an employee of the

Dehiwala-Mt. Lavinia Municipal Council misappropriated a sum of

Rs. 362089/- and committed an offence punishable under section

386 of the Penal Code read with section 5(1) of the Offences

Page 4 of 15

Against Public Property Act No. 12 Of 1982 As Amended By

Amendment Act No. 76 of 1988 and 28 of 1999.

The indictment has been served on the respondent on 27-04-2021 and the

matter has gone down several dates for the parties to consider concluding the

matter without going for a trial.

However, since it had not been materialized, on 05-11-2021, the case has been

fixed for trial for 04-04-2022, and the summons had been issued to PW-01.

When the matter came up for trial on the mentioned day, PW-01 had been absent

and the prosecuting State Counsel has moved for the postponement of the trial

on the basis that the summons had not been served on the said witness.

For matters of clarity, I will now reproduce the entire order pronounced by the

learned High Court Judge when the above application was made by the

prosecuting state counsel, as this revision application is based on the entirety of

the said order.

Although it appears that in the last paragraph of the above order, the discharge

of the respondent was on the basis that the prosecution has failed to not to call

the witnesses ( ), I would like to

attribute that to a typographical error, as the reasoning for the discharge of the

respondent is clearly the failure of the prosecution to summon the witness

number 01 before the Court on the trial date.

Page 6 of 15

It is settled law that the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is a

discretionary remedy.

In the case of Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd. Vs. Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd.

(1987) 1 SLR 5, it was held;

It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the appellate

Court is confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist

warranting its intervention.

In the case of Wijesinghe Vs. Thaamararatnam (Sriskantha Law Report Vol.

IV page 47), it was stated that;

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the

application discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of the

Court.

It was held in the case of Vanik Incorporation Ltd. Vs. Jayasekara (1997) 2

SLR 365 that,

Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has

occurred due to a fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but only

when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of

justice.

In paragraph six of the petition filed before this Court, the petitioner has

contended the following grounds as the exceptional grounds that require the

intervention of this Court to set aside the impugned order pronounced by the

learned High Court Judge.

a. The learned High Court Judge refused to accept the Summons

Report of the OIC SCIB Mount Lavinia dated 04.04.2022 on the

basis that it was not filed 3 days prior to the trial date.

b. The learned High Court Judge failed to consider the Summons

Report of the OIC SCIB Mount Lavinia dated 04.04.2022 which

Page 7 of 15

states that the summons could not be served on PW-01 as he is not

in the given address.

c. The learned High Court Judge failed to appreciate the application

made by the State Counsel that the summons has not been served

on PW-01 even though the Summons Report was not filed.

d. There is no provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15

of 1979 which empowers the High Court to discharge/release an

accused on the basis that the prosecution is not ready.

e. The learned High Court Judge has misapplied the dicta of Attorney

General Vs. Baranage (2003) 1 SLR 341 and Attorney General

Vs. Gunawardena (1996) 2 SLR 149.

i. In Attorney General Vs. Baranage (2003) 1 SLR 341,

the accused-appellant was acquitted after the closure of

the prosecution case due to lack of evidence.

ii. In Attorney General Vs. Gunawardena (1996) 2 SLR

149, the learned High Court Judge directed the jury to

return a verdict of not guilty after 4 out of 49 witnesses

listed in the indictment gave evidence. The Supreme

Court set aside all proceedings and a fresh trial was

directed on the basis that the learned High Court Judge

has failed to conform to section 212(2) as all material

evidence has not been considered.

iii. In the instant case, no evidence whatsoever has been

led and therefore discharging the respondent without

going into the merits of the case is illegal.

When it comes to the order of the learned High Court Judge, it is quite apparent

that the impugned order has been made on the 1st day where the case was fixed

for the trial, although several dates have been passed between the service of the

indictment to the respondent and the date 1st fixed for the trial.

Page 8 of 15

The impugned order has been pronounced even before the indictment was read

over to the respondent and recording a plea from him. It needs to be noted that

what would have been the result if the respondent chose to plead guilty to the

charge, if it was read over to him, which would result in considering about

serving summons on the PW-01 may not be necessary.

There is no doubt that the prosecution has not served summons on the PW-01

who was summoned to appear before the Court for the day. It appears from the

application made by the learned State Counsel who prosecuted the matter that

a postponement of the trial has been sought on the same basis.

Although the learned High Court Judge has decided that there was no report as

to whether summons were served or not on PW-01, it appears from the same

order that the said conclusion has been reached on the basis that the

prosecution has failed to file the summons report 3 days before the case to be

called before the Court as previously instructed.

The document marked P-2 before this Court shows that in fact the summons

returnable report has been filed before the High Court by the Officer In Charge

of the relevant police division on 04-04-2022 together with the police message

received from Malabe police station regarding their inability to serve the

summons on the said witness as he was not available in his house. The said

report had been filed the day before the trial was to be taken up and not 3 days

before as stated by the learned High Court Judge in his order.

It is quite apparent from the impugned order and as contended by the learned

SDSG, that the learned High Court Judge was well aware that there is no

provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to discharge an accused person

in a situation where the prosecution is not ready to conduct the trial. The learned

High Court Judge appears to have taken guidance from the two decided cases

considered by him to conclude that even there are no provisions to stop

proceedings before a High Court and discharge an accused person while the trial

Page 9 of 15

is ongoing, our Courts have acted under the inherent powers vested with the

High Court to stop further proceedings of an action.

Apart from the above conclusion, the learned High Court Judge has considered

section 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act also as relevant in this instance.

Section 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act is the section which provides for

cases not provided for in the Act.

The said section 7 reads as follows.

7. As regards matters of criminal procedure for which special

provisions may not have been made by this Code or by any other law

for the time being in force such procedure as the justice of the case

may require and as is not inconsistent with this Code may be

followed.

For better understanding of this Judgement, I would like to consider the two

appellate Court Judgements cited by the learned High Court Judge in his order.

The case of Attorney General Vs. Gunawardena (supra) was a case where the

accused in the case was charged for murder and after leading 4 out of the 49

witnesses listed, the learned Counsel for the accused applied to the Judge to

direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty, on the ground that the evidence

led up to that point of time as well as the evidence that could be led through the

other witnesses listed, did not disclose that the accused committed the offence.

The learned trial Judge accepted this position and directed the jury accordingly,

which resulted in the discharge of the accused. The Attorney General sought to

revise the said order.

This was a matter considered in terms of section 212 of the then existed

Administration of Justice Law in relation to criminal procedure. Section 200 is

the present corresponding section in terms of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act No. 15 of 1979, which is the Act that replaced the Administration of Justice

Law.

Page 10 of 15

The relevant considered section 212(2) of the Administration of Justice Law

provided :-

When the case for the prosecution is closed, if the Judge considers

that there is no evidence that the accused committed the offence, he

shall direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty.

It was held: -

Under this provision, the Judge can direct the jury to return a verdict of not

guilty only at the close of the prosecution case. A practice appears to have

developed in our Courts of Judges stopping a case even before that stage is

reached. This matter is referred to in a Judgement of the Court of criminal

appeal in Pauline de Croos Vs. The Queen 71 NLR 169.

The procedure actually adopted by the learned Judge in this case, is to our

knowledge not frequently resorted to by Judges in this country when it

becomes apparent to the Court and Counsel that to continue is to waste

precious time and that there is no purpose of flogging a dead horse. We

ourselves have no desire, at this stage of the development of the practice of

stopping trials at their virtual though not their technical end, to insist on

technicality to the point of almost sanctifying it.

Held further;

There is no reason to disagree with this dictum; if it is apparent to Court as

well as to counsel that to continue is to waste time and to flog a dead horse,

the case should of course be stopped. Again, if prosecuting Counsel

concedes or is constrained to admit that all the evidence on which the

prosecution case is based has been led and what remains to be led is formal

evidence or other supporting evidence which will not take the case any

further, then the virtual end of the prosecution case has been reached and

a Court may fairly act under section 212(2). But if there is such other

evidence still to be led on behalf of the prosecution which a Judge has to

Page 11 of 15

reckon and give weight to in considering whether there is a case to go to the

jury, it appears to us that a Judge will be acting contrary to section 212(2)

in making a direction before he hears that evidence.

The other case the learned High Court Judge considered relevant was the case

of the Attorney General Vs. Baranage (2003) 1 SLR 341.

After the prosecution closed its case against the accused, the trial Judge acting

under section 200(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act acquitted and

discharged the accused without calling for his defence. The Attorney General

appealed against the acquittal.

Per Amaratunga, J.;

A practice has developed in our law to consider the submission of no

evidence at the virtual end of the prosecution case even though it has not

reached its terminal end. This practice is applicable not only to trials before

a jury but also to trials by a Judge without a jury.

It was held;

1. In a trial by a Judge without a jury, the Judge is the trier of facts and

as such at the end of the prosecution case in order to decide whether

he should call upon the accused for his defence he is entitled to

consider such matters as the credibility of the witness, the probability

of the prosecution case, the weight of evidence and the reasonable

influences to be drawn from the proven facts.

Having considered these matters, if the Judge comes to the conclusion

that he cannot place any reliance on the prosecution evidence, then the

resulting position is that the Judge has wholly discredited the evidence

for the prosecution. In such a situation, the Judge shall enter a verdict

of acquittal.

2. The true rule is that where the Judge concludes that the evidence, even

if believed by the jury and the legitimate inferences therefrom do not

Page 12 of 15

permit a conclusion of guilt beyond reasonable doubt to a reasonable

jury-man, he must direct an acquittal.

Having considered the facts and the law in relation to the Judgements cited by

the learned High Court Judge to justify his decision to discharge the respondent,

I have no option but to agree with the submissions of the learned SDSG that the

said cited Judgements have no direct bearing to the facts of the matter and the

learned High Court Judge was misdirected in that regard.

I am of the view that the learned High Court Judges reliance on the cited section

7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to justify the discharge was also a clear

misdirection.

The cited Attorney General Vs. Gunawardane (Supra) was a case where the

accused person has pleaded not guilty to the charge and was acquitted after

hearing part of the evidence relating to the charge on the basis that the charge

cannot be maintained even if the remaining evidence were to be led.

The cited Attorney General Vs. Baranage (Supra) was a case where the accused

was acquitted after the prosecution case was closed without calling a defence

from the accused.

The said cases are very much different to the circumstances under which the

learned High Court Judge decided to discharge the respondent in this case.

As pointed out correctly, 05-04-2022 was the date 1st fixed for the trial to be

taken up. Since the prosecution witness number 01 summoned for that day was

not served with the summons, the prosecuting State Counsel has sought an

adjournment of the trial on that basis. Although the learned High Court Judge

has concluded that the prosecution failed to file the summons report before 3

days of the date fixed for the trial, in fact it appears that the relevant summons

report was available, but not within the considered 3 days before the date fixed

for the trial.

Page 13 of 15

I am of the view that there was no reason for the learned High Court Judge to

consider that as a punitive measure to conclude that no summons report had

been filed. I am of the view that even if there was no summons report, there was

no justification for the learned High Court Judge to discharge the respondent

since this was the 1st date fixed for the trial and the learned prosecuting State

Counsel has given a valid reason as to why he is seeking a postponement of the

trial.

The considered section seven of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act is the section

where decisions can be taken when there are no special provisions as to the

criminal procedure made by the Code or any other law for the time being in force.

However, such steps have to be taken as the justice of the case may require and

not inconsistent with the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. I am of the view that

the Justice refers to in this section has to be considered in relation to justice

towards an accused person as well as the prosecution who took pain to file an

indictment against an accused person requiring the Court to decide on the

charge or charges against him based on the evidence placed before the Court. If

the Court is to discharge such an accused even without reading the indictment

over to him and requiring him to plead to the charge on the basis that the

summons had not been served on PW-01, I do not see any reason to conclude

that justice has been served.

It appears that the learned High Court Judge was well aware that no procedural

steps have been mentioned in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to discharge

an accused person indicted before a High Court when the prosecution is not

ready to prosecute the action. It is under that pretext that the learned High Court

Judge has decided to consider the cited two Judgements and section 7 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act as relevant to justify the discharge of the

respondent.

Page 14 of 15

As I have considered earlier, the cited two Judgements or section 7 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act has no relevance to the facts and circumstances that

led to the discharge of the respondent.

At this juncture, I think it is relevant to cite from the Judgement of the Attorney

General Vs. Sumathipala (supra) cited by the learned SDSG in his submissions.

This was a case, where their Lordships of the Supreme Court considered the

views expressed by Justice Dr. Amarasinghe in his book Judicial Conduct,

Ethics and Responsibilities at page 284, which states thus;

The function of a Judge is to give effect to the express intention of

parliament. If legislation needs amendment, because it results in injustice,

the democratic process must be used to bring about the change. It has been

the unchallenged view expressed by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka for

almost 100 years.

In Government Agents, Superintendent of Police Vs. Suddana et al. 1905

Tambiahs Report 39, Chief Justice Layard said, at the time when the privy

council was the countrys apex tribunal ;-

If we wrongly construe the law the remedy is by appeal to His Majesty in

council. If on the other hand we rightly construe the law and the law is

unpalatable to any section of the community, the remedy of that section of

the community is to endeavour, if possible to have the law amended. Such

endeavours, however should be constitutional.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no justification in learned High Court

Judges decision to discharge the respondent from the High Court proceedings

on the basis that the prosecution has failed to serve summons on PW-01 as there

is no such procedure available to discharge an accused person on that basis. I

am of the view that the learned High Court Judge also had no basis to discharge

the respondent even without reading the charge to him and requiring him to

plead to the charge.

Page 15 of 15

Under the circumstances, I find that the petitioner has established sufficient

exceptional circumstances for this Court to intervene into the order of the

learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly, I set aside the order dated 05-04-2022 by the learned High Court

Judge of Colombo and order that the case shall be revert back to the case role of

the Court.

The learned High Court Judge is directed to issue notice on the respondent and

fix the matter for trial and to proceed therefrom in accordance with the law.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this order to the High

Court of Colombo for necessary compliance.
