The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Colombo on 8 counts of criminal breach of trust and

criminal misappropriation for committing offences punishable in terms of

sections 389 and 386 of the Penal Code.

Count number 5 and 6 of the indictment had been withdrawn by the prosecution

at the trial. After the trial against the appellant, the learned High Court Judge of

Colombo by his judgement dated 12th December 2019 found the appellant guilty

only for the first count preferred against him. He was acquitted on the 2nd count

on the basis that the said count should be a count alternative to the 1st count

for which the appellant was found guilty. He was acquitted of 3rd, 4th, 7th and the

Page 3 of 9

8th count on the basis that the prosecution has failed to prove the said counts

against him.

Accordingly, by his sentencing order of the even date, the learned High Court

Judge, after having considered the mitigatory circumstances pleaded on behalf

of the appellant and the other relevant facts and the circumstances, has

sentenced the appellant for 30 months rigorous imprisonment for the count he

was found guilty, in addition to the fine and the default sentence imposed and

the compensation ordered to be paid to Singer Sri Lanka Ltd who was the

aggrieved party.

The count no. 1 for which the appellant was found guilty reads as follows.

1. The accused appellant on or about 3rd May 1999 in Colombo committed

the offence of criminal breach of trust by using a pay order handed over

to him by Singer Sri Lanka Ltd for a sum of Rs. 825,094/= by failing to

get the goods as required from Sri Lanka Customs, and instead getting

some other goods released contrary to the agreement entered by him

with the said Singer Sri Lanka Ltd, and thereby committing an offence

punishable in terms of section 389 of the Penal Code.

The facts that led to the conviction of the appellant to the above-mentioned count

are briefly as follows.

The appellant functioned as the owner of a clearing agency called Janaranjana

Enterprises, in assisting importers to clear goods from Sri Lanka Customs. In

his capacity as a clearance agent, it was the appellant who handled the relevant

paperwork and paid the relevant Customs levies on behalf of his clients and got

the goods imported by them released.

According to the evidence of PW-01, who was the Items Manager of Singer Sri

Lanka Ltd during the relevant period, the company has been dealing with the

appellant since 1999 for the purposes of getting their goods cleared from the

Customs. As of usual practice, when the company was informed of the relevant

Page 4 of 9

sum that needs to be paid to the customs in relation to the goods imported by

them relating to the 1st count preferred against the appellant, they have obtained

the pay order no. 272748 marked P-01 from their bank for a sum of Rs.

825,094/= and handed over to the appellant for the relevant purpose. Along with

the pay order marked P-01, the company has handed over another pay order for

a sum of Rs. 946,417/= (documents marked P-02) for the same purpose, which

is the amount in relation to the 3rd and the 4th counts preferred against the

appellant.

Since the relevant goods were not cleared within the normal time period, PW-01

has contacted the appellant and the appellant has given various excuses for not

getting the goods cleared from the Customs. He has informed that the relevant

file has been lost and a new file has to be reconstructed and there are issues

with the Customs. Lately, PW-01 has failed to even contact the appellant over

the phone. Upon suspicion, when it was inquired from the relevant bank, the

company has been informed that the relevant pay orders (P-01 and P-02) had

been paid to the Commissioner General of Customs. It has been discovered that

the relevant pay orders have been used to get some goods other than the goods

belonging to Singer Sri Lanka Ltd cleared from the customs.

The subsequent attempts by the company to contact the appellant has failed,

and the company has preferred a complaint in this regard to the Criminal

Investigation Department. The Singer Sri Lanka Ltd has had to incur additional

costs other than the sums mentioned in the pay orders to get the goods released

subsequently.

PW-01 has admitted under cross-examination that it was one Yatawara who was

a clerk at her institution who attended to these matters, and has stated that she

was unaware of any personal difficulties faced by the appellant. It has been found

that the relevant pay order P-01 has been used to get goods imported by one

Sunimal Enterprises.

According to the bank officials who were called as witnesses at the trial, when a

pay order of this kind is issued, it can be used to pay Customs duties in relation

to any other goods imported by any other importer, as the pay orders are not

issued for a specific consignment.

When called for a defence at the conclusion of the prosecution case, the appellant

has made a dock statement and has admitted that he had a business called

Janaranjana Enterprises where Customs clearance on behalf of his clients was

conducted, and has admitted that he was doing such clearance for Singer Sri

Lanka Ltd during the relevant period.

However, he has denied that he misappropriated or caused the criminal breach

of trust of the sums mentioned in the charges against him. He has taken up the

position that it was Kapila Yatawara who was a clerk at Singer Sri Lanka Ltd

that may have committed this offence.

The Ground of Appeal

The learned Counsel for the appellant formulated the following ground of appeal

for the consideration of the Court during the hearing of this appeal.

1. The learned Trial Judge has erred in law in applying principles relevant

to the circumstantial evidence with regard to the entrustment being the

threshold ingredient of section 389 of the Penal Code.

It was submitted by the learned Counsel for the appellant that since there was

no direct evidence as to the entrustment by Singer Sri Lanka Ltd to the appellant,

the learned High Court Judge has considered the circumstantial evidence to

determine that there was such an entrustment. It was his view that the learned

High Court Judge was misdirected in that regard, and there was no

circumstantial evidence that points directly towards the appellant. He was of the

view that the evidence led in this action points to another person who may have

caused the criminal breach of trust, and that fact has not been considered in its

correct perspective by the learned High Court Judge.

Page 6 of 9

It was contended that the circumstantial evidence considered by the learned

High Court Judge was not sufficient to prove the charge against him and the

learned High Court Judge has acted on suspicious circumstances, which would

not suffice to find an accused person guilty.

The submissions of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) was that the

prosecution has sufficiently proved that the relevant pay orders were entrusted

to the appellant for the purposes of clearing the goods imported by Singer Sri

Lanka Ltd, and that the appellant has used the relevant pay orders to clear goods

belonging to some other company, thereby committing the criminal breach of

trust.

He pointed out that the appellant has failed to challenge any of the relevant

evidence of PW-01, and the claim by the appellant in relation to another person

was a concocted story.

Consideration of the Ground of Appeal

It is clear from the judgement of the learned High Court Judge that he was very

much aware as to the relevant matters that need to be proved in a case of this

nature, and the standard of proof.

The offence of criminal breach of trust has been defined in section 388 of the

Penal Code in the following manner.

388. Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with

any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts

to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that

property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in

which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express

or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust,

or willfully suffers any other person so to do, commits criminal

breach of trust.

The fact that the Singer Sri Lanka Ltd had obtained two bank pay orders through

Hatton National Bank in order to clear the goods imported by them from Sri

Lanka Customs are proven and undisputed facts in this case. The fact that the

appellant was in the business of running a clearing agency in the name of

Janaranjana Enterprises and was providing services to Singer Sri Lanka Ltd and

several other importers during the time relevant to the incident are also

undisputed facts. The fact that the pay orders marked P-01 and P-02 had been

used to pay Customs duties in relation to goods imported by another importer

had been proved beyond reasonable doubt by way of the evidence led by the

prosecution.

Under the circumstances, the learned High Court Judge has correctly held that

the entrustment of the relevant pay orders to the appellant for the purposes of

clearing goods imported by Singer Sri Lanka Ltd has to be proved before the trial

Court. It has been decided to consider whether there is sufficient circumstantial

evidence against the appellant to that fact in his judgement. This approach has

become necessitated because of the fact that it was not the PW-01 who gave

evidence in Court on behalf of the company who had physically handed over the

relevant pay orders to the appellant.

It had been the evidence of PW-01 that after the relevant pay orders were handed

over to the appellant, the goods were not released as the usual practice within 2

or 3 days of the handing over of the pay order. This has resulted in PW-01

inquiring about this matter from the appellant who was the designated clearing

agent of her company. It was the evidence of PW-01 that the appellant provided

various evasive answers and explanations for the delay and subsequently failed

to answer the phone or he could not be found in his usual address of the

business.

None of these pieces of evidence had been materially challenged or disputed at

the trial. Subsequently, it had been discovered that the said pay orders had been

used to clear some other goods imported by some other companies on whose

Page 8 of 9

behalf the appellant had acted as the clearing agent. The relevant witnesses have

given clear evidence in that regard at the trial.

Considering all these pieces of evidence together, and in its totality, the learned

High Court Judge has decided that the prosecution has proved entrustment as

required in section 388 of the Penal Code to determine that the appellant has

acted in criminal breach of trust towards Singer Sri Lanka Ltd.

I do not find any reason to agree with the contention that the considered

circumstantial evidence does not prove beyond reasonable doubt, the culpability

of the appellant, but only creates a suspicion towards him.

On the contrary, I am of the view that as considered by the learned High Court

Judge, the entrustment by Singer Sri Lanka Ltd to the appellant the relevant pay

orders for the purposes of clearing the goods imported by the company from Sri

Lanka Customs had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

The evidence led in this action clearly establishes that the appellant after

obtaining the relevant pay orders which can be used to clear any other goods as

well, had used them to clear goods belonging to other companies and had acted

in criminal breach of trust towards the Singer Sri Lanka Ltd.

It is clear from the evidence placed before the Court that the appellant has

attempted to put the blame on one Yatawara without any basis to cover his

misdeeds. The learned High Court Judge has well considered the defence put

forward by the appellant and was correct in determining that there was no basis

to conclude that the stand of the appellant had created any doubt on the

prosecution evidence, and the appellants claim was an afterthought.

The learned High Court Judge has also considered whether the actions of the

appellant in clearing goods belonging to some other company can be a mistake

and has found that no such mistake in relation to Customs transactions can

take place.

Page 9 of 9

For the above reasoning, I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge has

found the appellant guilty of the 1st count preferred against him with a sound

basis, and after analyzing the evidence placed before the Court in its correct

perspective.

Hence, I find no reason to interfere with the conviction of the appellant for the

1st count preferred against him.

I find that there had been a misdirection as to the acquittal of the appellant on

the 3rd count, which is also a count where the appellant has misappropriated the

sum mentioned in the pay order marked P-02 on the wrong premise that the 3rd

count relates to a company called Jayawansha Construction. However, since

there is no appeal in that regard, I would make no order in relation to the said

misdirection.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has well considered the mitigatory

factors urged on behalf of the appellant in sentencing him for 30 months rigorous

imprisonment, which is according to law and the facts and circumstances of the

case.

The appeal is dismissed as I find no merit in the ground of appeal urged.

Accordingly, the conviction and the sentence dated 12th December 2019 by the

learned High Court Judge of Colombo is affirmed.
