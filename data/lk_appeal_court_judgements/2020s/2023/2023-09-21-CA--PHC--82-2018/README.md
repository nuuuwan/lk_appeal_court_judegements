This is an appeal preferred by the complainant-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the appellant) on the basis of being aggrieved by the order dated02-

05-2018 of the learned Provincial High Court Judge of the Central Province

Holden in Kandy.

The learned High Court Judge, after having considered an application filed by

the appellant seeking to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court in order

to challenge an order made on 22-11-2017 by the learned Magistrate of

Dambulla has refused to issue notice in relation to the said revision application.

It is against the said refusal, the appellant had filed this appeal.

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant contended

that the learned High Court Judge was wrong when it was refused to issue the

notices in relation to the revision application filed by the appellant and urged

this Courts intervention to vacate the said order and also to vacate the order

dated 22-11-2017 made by the learned Magistrate of Dambulla.

The facts relating to this matter can be summarized in the following manner.

The appellant has filed a private plaint in terms of section 136 (1) (a) of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 against two persons. The said two

persons are the accused-respondents named in this appeal.

By the said private plaint, the appellant has intended to charge the two accused-

respondents on three counts in terms of the Penal Code. The counts being

section 389, section 400 and section 457. The 2nd accused-respondent

mentioned has been named in relation to the 3rd count only.

When this matter was considered before the learned Magistrate of Dambulla for

the purposes of issuing summons against the mentioned accused-respondents,

the learned Magistrate has very correctly considered the relevant law in that

regard and has decided that he must be satisfied that there is a sufficient ground

to commence proceedings against the accused mentioned in the charges.

Accordingly, the learned Magistrate has decided to allow the appellant to lead

evidence to establish that there is a sufficient basis for him to maintain this

private plaint.

The appellant has given evidence in that regard and according to his evidence,

he has filed this private plaint against the first accused mentioned in the charge

sheet on the basis that although he agreed to lease out a fuel filling station,

owned by him to the 1st accused for a period of two years, the 1st accused in

breach of that agreement has prepared a lease agreement to cover a period of

four years and got him and other witnesses to the agreement to sign on blank

papers in that regard.

He has charged the 2nd accused on the basis that he was the Notary who

prepared the claimed fraudulent document.

It is clear from the order of the learned Magistrate that the allegations made by

the appellant against the accused-respondents have been well considered by the

learned Magistrate. The learned magistrate has concluded that there is no basis

Page 6 of 7

for him to conclude that the relevant document marked by the appellant as P-1

in the Court is a fraudulent document and a document prepared contrary to the

instructions given by the appellant to the 2nd accused-respondent mentioned.

The learned Magistrate has also considered the fact of the failure by the appellant

to make a proper complaint to the police, which is the primary investigative

agency in relation to a matter like this and had considered this failure as a

material point which is not the normal behaviour of a person who claims that he

was made to sign a blank document and deprived of his rights as claimed by

him.

The learned Magistrate has also considered that the unavailability of any

evidence other than the claim made by the appellant to support his contention

before the Court as relevant for the purposes of this matter.

Accordingly, being not satisfied that the appellant has established sufficient

grounds for him to get the summons issued against the accused-respondents

has refused to issue summons.

When this order was challenged before the learned Provincial High Court Judge

of the Central Provide Holden in Kandy, the learned High Court Judge too had

correctly considered the relevant legal provisions and had come to a correct

conclusion that the appellant has failed to establish that he has a sufficient basis

to proceed in this private plaint and to get the summons issued by the learned

Magistrate of Dambulla.

It is on that basis that the learned High Court Judge has refused to issue notice

and dismissed the revision application.

Although the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the learned

Magistrate as well as the learned High Court Judge was misdirected when the

relevant orders were made, I find no basis to agree with the submissions made

by the learned counsel for the appellant.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of any merit.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to forward a copy of this judgement to the

Provincial High Court of the Central Province Holden in Kandy and to the

Magistrates Court of Dambulla for information.
