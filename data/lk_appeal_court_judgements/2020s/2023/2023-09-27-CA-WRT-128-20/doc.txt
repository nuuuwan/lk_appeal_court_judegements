MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioners in this Application in the form of Public Interest Litigation,

are seeking, orders in the nature of Writs of Mandamus seeking several

directions;

1) To the 3rd Respondents to make regulations against single-use plastic and

coastal pollution prevention,

2) To the 1st Respondent to implement the Sri Lanka Coastal Zone and

Resource Management Plan 2018 (marked P13),

3) To the 1st Respondent to enforce the Coast Conservation and Coastal

Resource Management Act No. 57 of 1981 as amended, especially specified

sections thereto,

4) To the 3rd Respondent to enforce Coast Conservation and Coastal Act as

amended and National Environmental Act as amended,

5) To the 2nd and 3rd Respondents to enforce the National Environmental Act,

including coastal zone protection,

6) To the 4th Respondent to give effect to Marine Pollution Prevention Act No.

35 of 2008,

7) To the 2nd and 3rd Respondents to Investigate the Mt. Lavinia Beach

nourishment project for compliance with environmental laws,

8) To the Respondents investigate and punish those responsible for ocean

waste discharge and to the 3rd Respondent to amend regulations to include

coastal zones in mandatory environmental assessments.

The primary issue in this application revolves around waste materials being

washed up onto beaches and the coastal & marine pollution caused thereto

in connection with a 'Beach Nourishment Project'. It is submitted that the

said project is mainly implemented for the purpose of enhancing coastal

stabilization through the concept of beach nourishment which provides a

buffer against coastal erosion and to supply the required quantity of sediment

to littoral drift. For this purpose, a material quantity of sand had been dredged

from off-shore designated areas and the dredged sand is to be directly pumped

Page 4

to the required locations of the beach. Locations to be nourished have been

identified as Mount Lavinia to Angulana and Kalutara. The Petitioners allege

that the sand nourishment project had caused adverse environmental

impacts, that the said project had not followed the mandatory provisions

related to environmental laws.

The Petitioners contend that the Respondents' inaction, omission, or failure

to perform their duties is illegal, actions are against the objectives of relevant

laws and international conventions and are inconsistent with the

Constitution's Directive Principles, Fundamental Duties, and citizens'

fundamental rights. The Petitioners also assert that the government, through

the Respondents, has neglected its duty as the guardian of natural resources

and biodiversity. It is also submitted by the Petitioners that the Respondents'

actions violate international principles of environmental law, including

sustainable development, inter-generational equity, the precautionary

principle, and the public trust doctrine.

The Respondents position is that all necessary requirements imposed by the

regulatory authorities and the requirements under the law have been

complied with and the due process in procurement has been followed. Further

they submit that the said project, which has not been identified as a

prescribed project, does not require an IEE or an EIA to be conducted in terms

of the law.

In the said context, it is for this Court to specifically analyze the conduct of

the Respondents in carrying out the said project to determine whether they

were in compliance with established laws.

The Beach Nourishment Project began with a Cabinet Memorandum dated

02.02.2018 submitted by the former Minister of Mahaweli Development and

Environment. The memorandum sought approval for implementing the

Colombo South Sand Nourishment Project using the Sand Engine

Methodology, covering the coastline from Colpetty to Mount Lavinia (marked

as '1R2'). It highlighted that coastal erosion had been identified in areas

Page 5

including Mount Lavinia, Dehiwala, Ratmalana, Wedikanda, and Moratuwa,

emphasizing the need to nourish the coastline from Mount Lavinia to

Ahangama.

By the said Cabinet Memorandum, the following recommendations have been

submitted for approval of the Cabinet Ministers:

a. To stabilize the coastline from Mount Lavinia to Ahungalla by feeding

sand through the Sand Engine Mechanism.

b. To start procurement process through the International Competitive

Bidding System for the selection of a suitable Sand Mining Contractor to

implement the project.

c. To exempt the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal

Resources Management from the royalty to be paid to the GSMB for the

Sand Mining Project implemented in the off-shore and Sand Catchment

Project executed from Mount Lavinia to Angulana.

By Cabinet Decision dated 28.02.2018, the approval of the Cabinet of

Ministers had been granted for the said project. A Cabinet Memorandum from

the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment on 30.05.2018

sought approval for extending the Colombo South Sand Nourishment Project

from Mount Lavinia to Angulana using the Sand Engine Methodology due to

changes in the project scope. Cabinet Approvals and Notes to the Cabinet

demonstrate that the project was not conducted arbitrarily, with Cabinet

approvals obtained at each step, including the extension from Mount Lavinia

to Angulana. On 04.07.2018, the Cabinet approved the extension of the

project to the Angulana coastline (marked '1R8'). On 16.08.2018, a Note had

been submitted to the Cabinet for approval to implement the project along

with a Comprehensive Feasibility Study, which had thereafter been granted

on 28.08.2018 (marked '1R9', '1R10'). On 21.09.2018, another Cabinet

Memorandum requested approval for calling tenders through LICB (Limited

International Competitive Bidding) from contractors already mobilized in Sri

Page 6

Lanka for the Sand Nourishment Project (marked '1R11'). The Cabinet had

approved this request on 18.10.2018 (marked '1R12').

In determining whether necessary requirements imposed by the regulatory

authorities and the requirements under the law have been complied with, this

Court observes as follows.

The 1st Respondent had requested the renewal of Environmental Approval for

offshore sand mining and the Beach Nourishment Project from the CEA (2nd

Respondent) after Cabinet approval (marked '1R4'). The CEA had responded

on 06.06.2018 (marked 'IR5'), indicating that a similar project occurred in

2014 to nourish Unawatuna Bay with 200,000m3 of sand mined from the

same location, 5-10 km away from Ratmalana Moratuwa DS Administration

boundary. The CEA observed that the present project is an alteration to the

original proposal due to differences in the transfer route and the quantity of

sand to be dredged. The 1st Respondent replied on 07.06.2018 (marked '1R6'),

providing clarifications for queries raised by the 2nd Respondent. This

response addresses issues such as environmentally protected/sensitive

habitats, precautionary measures, and impacts on fisheries. After obtaining

Cabinet Approvals, it is submitted that the 1st Respondent had conducted a

comprehensive Feasibility Study for the extraction of 800,000 m3 of sand and

the beach nourishment project. A Feasibility Study Report (1R13) has been

prepared, covering project details, environmental impacts, mitigation

measures, and legal requirements. It concludes that the proposed beach

nourishment project has the least impact compared to other coastal

stabilization measures and is considered the most environmentally friendly

solution in coastal engineering.

Accordingly, the environmental approval which was requested by letter dated

28.05.2018 has been granted by the CEA on 20.06.2018 (marked '1R20'). It

is also noted that the Industrial Mining License has been issued by the GSMB

for the period of 26.03.2019 to 25/3/2020 (marked 'R21').

With regard to the Environment Impact Assessment, Part IVC of the National

Environment Act, No. 47 of 1980 (as amended) outlines the approval process

for certain projects. Section 23Z empowers the Minister to designate

"Prescribed Projects" through an Order published in the Gazette. Only these

"Prescribed Projects" mandatorily require an Environmental Impact

Assessment (EIA) or an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE).

Section 23BB(1) mandates that the project approving agencies must request

government departments to submit an IEE or EIA within a specified timeframe

for projects seeking approval. The Gazette Notification No. 772/22, dated

24.06.1993, published under Section 23Y of the National Environment Act,

lists projects considered as "Prescribed Projects. It is observed that Beach

Nourishment Projects are not included in this list, meaning they are not

required to undergo an IEE or EIA if not identified as "Prescribed Projects".

His Lordship Malalgoda J. in SC Appeal 26/2012 SC Minuted 29.10.2021

quoting Thajudeen Vs. Sri Lanka Tea Board and Another (1981)2 Sri LR

471 held as follows:

"In Thajudeen, the Honourable Justice Ranasinghe, quoting de. Smith's

Judicial Review of Administrative Action (4th ed) 540, 561 stated that,

'Mandamus has always been awarded as an extraordinary, residuary

and supplementary remedy to be granted only when there is no other

means of obtaining justice. Even though all other requirements for

securing the remedy have been satisfied by the applicant, the Court will

decline to exercise its discretion in his favour if a specific alternative

remedy equally convenient beneficial and effectual is available. Thus, the

Writ of Mandamus is principally a discretionary remedy a legal tool for

the dispensation of justice, when no other remedy is available."

This Court also observes that in Public Interest Law Foundation vs.

Central Environmental Authority & Another (2001 (3) Sri LR 330):

Page 8

"The Court is ill equipped to form an opinion on environmental matters -

being best left to people who have specialised knowledge and skills in

such spheres. Even if a matter may seem to be pre-eminently one of

public law, the Courts may decline to exercise review because it is

felt that the matter is not justiciable, i.e. not suitable to judicial

determination.

In view of the above, this Court observes that while the administrative acts

have been carried out in terms of the law, at this juncture; necessity does not

arise for this Court to inquire and analyze the technical intricacies of the

matter. Further, at the outset, the reliefs sought by the Petitioners are too

broad, not specific and do not encompass or sufficiently justify a fit and

proper reason for issue of a Writ of Mandamus.

As such, I hold that the decisions challenged by the Petitioners are in line

with established principles of law. The Respondents have not acted ultra vires

or in an arbitrary, capricious, or illegal manner. In this respect, I hold that

the Petitioners are not entitled for the reliefs as prayed for.

For the above reasons, I dismiss the Application of the Petitioners and make

no Order as to the costs of this Application .

Application dismissed.
