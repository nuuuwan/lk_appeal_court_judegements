Sasi Mahendran, J.

The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as 'the Accused')

along with the 4th and 5th accused (both acquitted after trial) had been indicted before the

High Court of Panadura on the basis of unlawful assembly to commit murder of one

Mathalge Weerasinghe, alias Kaluwa and in the alternative on the basis of common

intention to commit murder.

The prosecution led the evidence of eleven witnesses and production marked as P1

to P9. The 1st Accused provided evidence from the evidence box and the 2nd,3rd, 4th, and 5th

Accused made dock statements. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court

Judge convicted the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Accused of murder, imposing the death sentence, and

acquitted the 4th and 5th Accused.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction the Accused appealed to this court.

The Following are the Grounds of Appeal set out in the written submission:

Page 3 of 10

1. The Prosecution has failed to establish the specific act or omission

committed by the Appellant that would categorize him as a member of an

unlawful assembly, despite claiming that witnesses saw the Appellant

enter the house.

2. The Learned Trial Judge has relied on uncorroborated and inconsistent

evidence to convict the Appellant.

3. The charge of unlawful assembly is untenable, as only three accused were

charged with being members of an unlawful assembly.

4. The Learned Trial Judge failed to take into account that the Appellants

acted under grave and sudden provocation while under the influence of

liquor during their attack on the Deceased.

5. The Learned Trial Judge neglected to consider the demeanor and

deportment of the prosecution witnesses when evaluating their evidence.

6. The Learned Trial Judge incorrectly applied the legal principles related to

the dock statement and did not accord the dock statement the appropriate

prominence and due consideration in line with established legal principles.

The facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that:

According to PW2 Pathirage Sumanawathie (the Deceased's mother and

eyewitness to this case), she stated that on the fatal day of October 30, 2001, she was

seated on a rock near the foundation, which, according to her, was 3 feet away from her

house. She was with her eldest son and Washington when she witnessed ten men

approaching her house and heading toward the back of the residence. She recognized some

of the men as she had known them personally; Chaminda/Daminada (2nd Accused) used

to visit their house prior to these events. In addition to Chaminda/Daminada, she

recognized Upali (1st Accused) and Sudu (3rd Accused) but did not know the names of the

others as she had known them for only a short period. With sufficient lighting in the area,

she observed that they were armed: one with a sword, others with knives, and a club.

Although she had identified the 2nd and 3rd Accused, she could not confirm whether they

were armed at that moment.

According to PW2, approximately 2 to 3 minutes after the accused retreated

behind the house, she witnessed 10 men entering through the front door. Another 2 to 3

Page 4 of 10

minutes later, two individuals emerged from the house, holding the deceased. At this

point, the 1st Accused struck the deceased on his shoulder with a sword. The deceased was

then moved to an area behind the house, where his body was left. Subsequently, the 1st

Accused swung the sword in the direction of PW2. The group then departed toward the

road, indicating that their task was completed. Overwhelmed by fear, PW2 fell

unconscious and did not inspect the crime scene. Upon regaining consciousness, she

learned of her son's demise, and her statement was subsequently recorded by the police.

During the prosecution's questioning, PW2 acknowledged the presence of the 4th

and 5th Accused. However, due to insufficient lighting, she could not confidently identify

what the 5th Accused was holding. Furthermore, at the trial, she couldnt identify any

weapons.

During her cross-examination, PW2 stated that she had not seen her husband,

Sumanadasa (PW1), at the time of the incident, as he had gone to take a bath. She

asserted that she witnessed the gruesome event from the foundation of her property. Her

testimony introduces some ambiguity, as she mentioned that along with the five Accused,

another five individuals entered the premises. This creates uncertainty about the exact

number of people involved. Although she claimed to have observed the event, she could

not recall who was with her at the time, as previously indicated during her examination-

in-chief. She also noted that she did not see what transpired behind the house.

PW2 stated that she saw her son being brought outside the front door frame.

However, she could not identify who was holding the Deceased when he emerged from the

house. She further mentioned that after the 1st Accused struck the Deceased on the

shoulder, the sword also hit a wall, leaving a mark. She saw the 1st Accused carrying a

blood-stained sword but could not confirm whether anyone else was armed.

It is pertinent to note that during her cross-examination she admitted that, she

did not mention the 2nd Accused name in her police statement, despite his prior visits to

their house. This omission calls into question the credibility of her testimony with regard

to the 2nd Accuseds involvement and was not adequately considered by the Learned Trial

Judge.

In his testimony, PW1 Mahethelge Sumanadasa, (an eyewitness and the father of

the Deceased), described the distance between their house and the well as approximately

30 to 33 meters. While preparing for a bath, he noticed a group of seven to eight

Page 5 of 10

individuals approaching from the direction of Kaddulla. However, only five people entered

his property. He was able to identify four of the five Accused by name. Notably, PW1

stated that the 2nd Accused was related to PW2, although this detail was conspicuously

absent from her witness statement. He observed that the 1st Accused was armed with a

sword, while the 3rd Accused had a knife; he could not confirm what weapons, if any, the

other Accused carried.

PW1 heard his daughter-in-law shouting from inside the house. Subsequently, he

heard a noise coming from the vicinity of the kitchen. Upon investigation, he found his

son's lifeless body near a jack tree, observing that his son's shoulder had been severed.

The 1st Accused then approached PW1 and swung a sword in his direction, asking, "

" ("Where are you going?"). Stupefied by the events, PW1 was momentarily

immobilized. After witnessing the tragic scene, he immediately rushed to the police

station.

During his cross-examination, PW1 stated that he returned home from work at

6:30 p.m. on the fatal day and sat on the foundation, from where he had a clear view of

the well. At that time, PW2 had left for a neighboring house. He claimed not to have seen

PW2, despite her statement in her own cross-examination that she was also at the

foundation. When questioned by the defense as to whether he witnessed the entire

incident involving the Deceased being attacked, he initially denied it but later changed

his answer to confirm that he did. It is noteworthy that this was not the first instance

where PW1 went back from his testimony. When further probed by the Counsel for the 3rd

Accused about whether the 3rd Accused was carrying a pole, PW1 confirmed, but later he

stated that he saw the 3rd Accused had a knife. PW1 further stated that he saw four people

holding the Deceased when they emerged from the house. After witnessing this horrifying

event, he proceeded to the police station without informing his wife about the incident.

Counsel for the Accused argued that the Learned Trial Judge erred in law by inadequately

analyzing the evidence presented before him, applying the theory of photographic memory

to excuse the witnesses' inconsistencies and contradictions. Upon review of the evidence

of PW1 in the light of the vital contradiction found in this evidence, we are unable to

accept the Learned High Court Judge's view on accepting this evidence.

Considering the multiple contentions presented above, credibility becomes a

matter of factual evaluation rather than a legal issue.When we analyse this evidence he

Page 6 of 10

was not consistent therefore he is not a reliable witness, this evidence could not be deemed

as reliable.

According to PW3, Upul Wijerathne (nephew to the Deceased), when he had gone

to the shop at 5:30 pm, he saw his uncle (the Deceased) with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Accused.

PW3 recognized the 1st Accused as he had known him personally; the 2nd Accused had a

close relationship with the Deceaseds family, and the 3rd Accused was a friend of the

Deceased. At that time, the Deceased was playing (with marbles) along with

the aforementioned Accused. Later, PW3 witnessed a commotion between the 1st Accused

and the Deceased. The 1st Accused grabbed the Deceaseds t-shirt and threatened to get

back his money, and they had been arguing back and forth. Thereafter, the 1st Accused

gave the Deceased money, and they both consumed some moonshine. Later, PW3 and the

Deceased went home together. Subsequently, the 1st and 3rd Accused arrived on a bicycle

and engaged in a heated altercation. The 2nd Accused also got involved on the premise

that if the Deceased were to fight the 1st Accused, they would get involved as well. PW3s

Loku mama and Podi mama also got involved, and they all dispersed and went back home.

After a while, he saw four to five people approach his grandmothers house, and the 1st

and 2nd Accused were armed with swords. He witnessed this while taking cover near a

stack of cinderblocks and saw the Accused bring the Deceased out of the front door of the

house. PW3 then fled to inform the police. On the way, he met his Loku mama, who said

that he would inform the police and instructed him to return home. Upon arrival, he

inquired about the Deceased from PW2 and was shown the Deceased lying outside the

kitchen area with his right hand cut off.

In his cross-examination, he stated that he was at Sandaya Achchis house during

this time. The area was well lit where the Accused entered but was unable to recall how

many were present, nor the weapons in the possession of the Accused. He could not

confirm if there were swords or clubs, and he did not witness the Accused attacking or

cutting the Deceased

According to PW8, Police Inspector Vipulasena, upon arresting the 4 Accused on

31/10/2001 at the Kirigala Bus station, after their statements were recorded, they left for

Himagiri Colony at 20:05. The 2nd Accused directed the police officers to a cesspit situated

10 meters away from his sisters house; upon scrutiny, they discovered two swords and a

Page 7 of 10

manna inside the cesspit. The recovery of the weapons was in accordance with Section 27

of the Evidence Ordinance.

According to the evidence of PW10, the Judicial Medical Officer, there were 10

injuries recorded that resulted in the loss of heart rate and lung function due to bleeding

and trauma inflicted by cuts to the head and neck from a sharp-edged weapon. He

indicated that the possibility of death was mainly due to the 5th injury recorded, which

could result in instant death. Further, he stated that more than one weapon would have

been used to inflict such injuries.

When we peruse the evidence testified under oath by the 1st Accused, he denied

this allegation and stated that, on the fatal day, he had played , and there

was an argument between him and the Deceased, which ended with no animosity between

each other. He later learned from the 2nd Accused that the police were searching for the

aforementioned Accused for the death of the Deceased. The 1st and 2nd Accused

surrendered themselves to the police station thereafter, as their position was that the

police were looking for them in connection with this incident.

The question arises whether the injuries inflicted on the Deceased during the

fatal attack by the 1st Accused caused his death.

When we analyze the aforesaid Judicial Medical Officers evidence with regard to

the multiple injuries inflicted on the Deceased with a sharp-edged weapon, it is

paramount to scrutinize whether the Deceased died of the injuries caused by a sharp-

edged weapon or if they resulted from something else.

In order to answer this question, we shall look at the case of Kumara de Silva

and 2 others vs. Attorney General [2010] 2 S.L.R. 169, His Lordship Sisira De Abrew held

that,

In all these the weapon used was a dangerous weapon and the location of the

injury and the force of the blow was such that it is sufficient to impute knowledge on the

part of the accused that bodies injury caused thereby could possibly lead to death. In order

to establish a charge of murder under section 294(3) of the Penal Code there must be

Page 8 of 10

material which would enable the Judge to hold that in the ordinary course of nature the

injury or injuries caused by a particular accused were sufficient to cause death as opposed

to a mere likelihood of causing death. E.g.: Attorney General vs. Somadasa. In this case

no single injury caused by any single accused has created an antecedent probability of

death. According to medical evidence only a combination of injuries no. 3, 7 and 8 inflicted

by different accused persons has resulted in probability of death resulting in the normal

course of events due to shock and haemorrhage. Therefore the charge of murder should

fail, as against all 03 accused persons in respect of their individual acts. As to the mens

rea of the accused at the time of the assault there is no conclusive proof whether any one

or more of the accused were harbouring an intention to cause the death of the deceased.

If they so intended they could have easily caused a necessarily fatal injury to a more

vulnerable part of the body such at the neck or the heart. Resolving the doubt in favour

of the Accused I hold that each of the accused committed the offence and inflicted the

respective injuries on the deceased with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to

cause death. Therefore the more appropriate finding is a conviction for the offence of

culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of knowledge, punishable under

section 297 of the Penal code.

Therefore we hold that there is no clear evidence to show that the cut injuries

inflicted by the 1st Accused resulted in the death of the Deceased.

Next, we must examine whether an unlawful assembly was indeed constituted by

the three Accused with the aim of perpetrating an assault on the Deceased. The onus is

on the Prosecution to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused were

active participants and that they harboured a common object. Mere presence at the scene

of the crime is insufficient to sustain a charge.

Following the case of Jagathsena and others v G.D.P Perera and others [1992], 1

S.L.R 375, His Lordship Ranasinghe, J held,

The mere presence of a person in an assembly does not render him a member of

an unlawful assembly, unless it is shown that he said or did something or omitted to do

something which would make him a member of such unlawful assembly. The prosecution

must place evidence pointing to each accused having done or said something from which

the inference could be drawn that each entertained the object which is said to be the

common object of such assembly. Omnibus evidence must be carefully scrutinized to

eliminate all chances of false or mistaken implication as the possibility of persons in an

Page 9 of 10

assembly resenting or condemning the activities of misguided persons cannot be ruled out

and caution has to be exercised in deciding which of the persons present can be safely

described as members of the unlawful assembly. Although as a matter of law an overt act

is not a necessary factor bearing upon membership of an unlawful assembly, yet, it is

safer to look for some evidence of participation by each person alleged to be a member

before holding that such person is a member of the unlawful assembly, lest innocent

persons be punished for no fault of their's. The common object of an assembly is an

inference from facts to be deduced from the facts and circumstances of each case. The

common object can be collected from the nature of the assembly, the arms used by them,

the behaviour of the assembly at or before the scene of occurrence, and subsequent

conduct. The common object must be readily deducible from the direct as well as

circumstantial evidence, including the conduct of the parties. It is not sufficient for such

evidence to be consistent with such an inference, but must be the only conclusion

possible.

To further scrutinize the culpability of the aforementioned accused parties, it is

imperative to delineate the shared mens rea among the trio. For the prosecution to

successfully sustain a charge, mere physical presence at the scene is insufficient; rather,

the prosecution must incontrovertibly establish an overt act evidencing the accused

parties' requisite criminal intent.

In the case of Queen v. Vincent Fernando 65 NLR 265, His Lordship Basnayake, J, held;

A person who merely shares the criminal intention, or takes a fiendish delight

in what is happening but does no criminal act in furtherance of the common intention of

all is not liable for the acts of the others. To be liable under Section 32 a mental sharing

of the common intention is not sufficient, the sharing must be evidenced by a criminal act.

The Code does not make punishable a mental state however wicked it may be unless it is

accompanied by a criminal act which manifests the state of mind. In the Penal Code, the

words which refer to acts done extend also to illegal omissions.

Page 10 of 10

This dictum was followed in the case of Piyathilaka and 2 Others v. Republic of Sri Lanka

[1996] 2 S.L.R, His Lordship DR. GUNAWARDENA, J.

There is no iota of evidence placed before the trial against the 2nd and 3rd accused

with regard to whether they have actively participated in the assault on the deceased.

That is to say, whether they had shared the murderous intention with the 1st Accused.

Hence in view of the facts stated above we are of the view that there was no

unlawful assembly formed during the incident and we see that the 2nd and 3rd accused

appellants should be acquitted from all charges found guilty by the trial judge. Hence the

appeal of the 2nd and 3rd accused appellants are hereby allowed.

The next question is with regard to the culpability of the 1st accused.

From the evidence stated above we find that 1st accused caused injuries to the

deceased. Then the question is whether that injury had caused death to the deceased.

According to the doctor, there were several injuries found on the deceaseds body, and

further, he stated that there was more than one weapon that was used to inflict such

bodily injury.

In light of the above, we set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the

Learned Trial Judge against the 1st Accused. We find him guilty of voluntarily causing

grievous hurt by dangerous weapons under section 317 of the Penal Code. We therefore

impose a sentence of 7 years of rigorous imprisonment, from the date of the conviction by

the Learned Trial Judge.

As such the appeal of the 1st Accused appellant dismissed subject to the above

variation.
