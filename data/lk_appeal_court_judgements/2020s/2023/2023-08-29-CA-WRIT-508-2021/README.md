The Petitioner was an employee of the 4th Respondent- Independent Television Network

('ITN') and he has tendered his letter of resignation dated 30.05.2022 resigning from his

services at ITN. The reasons for resignation given in the said letter are confined only to alleged

personal and establishment matters which are not divulged therein. Moreover, in the said

letter he has taken the privilege of thanking ITN for all the support received by him during his

twenty-two-year period of service. Upon receipt of the said letter of resignation, the General

Manager of ITN has accepted such resignation with effect from 01.07.2022.

In the instant Application, the Petitioner challenges inter alia the following disciplinary orders

reflected in the letter dated 14.07.2021 marked 'P18' which is issued against the Petitioner by

ITN;

i. suspension of the increment for a period of two years from the year 2020.

ii. depriving promotions for a period of three years from the year 2021.

iii. severe warning.

iv. non-payment of the unpaid half wages for the period under suspension.

The above disciplinary orders have been imposed against the Petitioner as a result of him

being found guilty of all four charges, contained in the charge sheet dated 14.09.2020 marked

'P5', after a formal disciplinary inquiry. The final report of the said formal disciplinary inquiry

has been issued on 10.04.2021 and it is marked 'P16'. The Petitioner seeks mandates in the

nature of writs of certiorari quashing the said a.) charge sheet b.) inquiry report and c.)

disciplinary orders.

The Petitioner has been appointed as an Assistant Manager (News) by letter dated 01.08.2011

marked 'P2B' whereas he had joined the ITN in the year 2001. The letter 'P2B' clearly spells

out that the service conditions stipulated in the original letter of appointment dated

30.10.2001, marked 'P2A' will continue to be applicable subject to amendments. In terms of

clause 10 of the said letter of appointment 'P2A', the Petitioner is barred from engaging in full-

time or part-time external matters, either paid or unpaid, without obtaining prior approval.

According to the provisions of clause 9 of the said 'P2A', the Petitioner as an employee is not

Page 5 of 12

entitled to engage in any type of profitable or unprofitable activity, which is considered to be

harmful to the wellbeing of the ITN during his tenure of service. The allegation against the

Petitioner in a nutshell is that he has served as a Commentator at the radio station named

'Rasa FM' without permission of the managing authority of the ITN.

At the outset, what needs consideration by this Court is whether the Petitioner is entitled to

file an application for Judicial Review in respect of the disciplinary orders imposed against

him and the disciplinary proceedings conducted by the ITN. The main contention of the 1st,

2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents is that the decisions impugned by the Petitioner are related to

internal disciplinary issues arising out of the employer-employee relationship which comes

within the ambit of private contractual law and thus, those matters do not warrant the exercise

of the writ jurisdiction of this Court. Additionally, such Respondents assert that the Petitioner

is not entitled to maintain the instant application due to his failure to pursue the several

alternative remedies available to him. The 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents rely on the judicial

precedent enunciated in Ranjith Upali Wasantha Kumara Dissanayake v. The Peoples Bank and

others CA/Writ/241/2018 decided on 12.11.2018, S.C. Jayawickrama v. National Savings Bank

and others CA/Writ/112/2016 decided on 18.11.2020, Gawarammana v Tea Research Board and

others [2003] Sri L.R. 120, U.L. Karunawathie v People's Bank and others CA/Writ/863/2010

decided on 12.05.2015 in order to establish that all affairs and contracts of employment in

statutory bodies which have a nexus to the state and is also established by an Act of

Parliament are not subject to Judicial Review.

While accepting the proposition that the matters arising solely out of contracts of employment

are not subject to Judicial Review, I have taken a broader approach in respect of the

jurisprudence in this area of law, especially in reference to contracts entered into between the

employees and public institutions, in the cases of W. G. Chamila v. Urban Development

Authority and others CA/WRIT/215/2022 decided on 26.10.2022 and Devendra Budalge Sudesh

Lalitha Perera v. Janatha Estates Development Board and others, CA/WRIT/004/2022 decided

on 06.10.2022. In the said W. G. Chamila case this Court has considered judicial

pronouncements in several other cases to examine whether the Court of Appeal could exercise

its writ jurisdiction when the nature of the dispute described in the review application is based

on a contract of employment between the employer and the employee. This Court,

Page 6 of 12

considering all such judgments, including the decision in Devendra Budalge Sudesh Lalitha

Perera case, has decided in the said W. G. Chamila case that the Court of Appeal has the

discretionary power to exercise the writ jurisdiction even on a question arising out of a

contract of employment if the disciplinary order of a public authority was in breach of

statutory restrictions/provisions and also if the public authority has taken a decision assuming

a jurisdiction which he does not have or exceeding his jurisdiction by violating a statutory

requirement which eventually comes under any of the established grounds of judicial review.

The Petitioner contends that he is entitled to come before this Court and seek relief by way of

writs of certiorari if there is a statutory flavour within the relationship between the parties and

also there exists a violation of natural justice by the public authority. Hence, it is important

to assess whether the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents have violated any statutory provisions or

rules of natural justice when making the aforesaid disciplinary orders in reference to the

contract of employment between the Petitioner and the ITN.

The Petitioner in order to justify his Application to this Court for Judicial Review submits

five main reasons: 1) the formal disciplinary inquiry has been conducted in a biased and unfair

manner, 2) the charge sheet is ex facie defective, 3) the disciplinary order dated 14.07.2021

marked 'P18' was issued by the 2nd Respondent, who is not the disciplinary authority, 4) the

prosecution failed to prove at the inquiry that the Petitioner has not obtained prior approval

for the disputed radio commentary, and 5) the 3rd Respondent has failed to consider the

objections raised by the Petitioner at the inquiry.

The Petitioner raises the above first argument that the formal inquiry has been conducted in

a biased and unfair manner due to the rejection of his application at the inquiry to summon

Mr. Dhanushka Ramanayake (former Working Director of ITN) and similarly, allowing the

prosecution to give evidence based on the personal documents of the Petitioner which were

not listed under the list of documents in the charge sheet. Nonetheless, it appears that the

Petitioner also has not duly listed the said Mr. Ramanayake as a witness. Now a question

arises whether this Court should analyze the full evidence led at the said domestic inquiry to

inquire about the lists of witnesses etc. filed by parties and also the circumstances that

prevailed at the inquiry stage perhaps upon which the 3rd Respondent Inquiry Officer has

arrived at the impugned decisions.

Page 7 of 12

This Court has constantly decided that when the facts are in dispute and in order to get at the

truth it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in a suit where parties would have

ample opportunity to examine their witnesses.1 Similarly, I must draw my attention at this

stage to the following paragraph of Jayasuriya J in Kalamazoo Industries Ltd. and others v.

Minister of Labour and Vocational Training and Others [1998] 1 Sri L.R. 235 at p. 249

"...This court must keep prominently in forefront that it is exercising in this instance a very

limited jurisdiction quite distinct from the exercise of appellate jurisdiction. Relief by way of

certiorari in relation to an award made by an arbitrator will be forthcoming to quash such an

award only if the arbitrator wholly or in part assumes a jurisdiction which he does not have or

exceeds that which he has or acts contrary to principles of natural justice or pronounces an award

which is eminently irrational or unreasonable or is guilty of an illegality. The remedy by way of

certiorari cannot be made use of to correct errors or to substitute a correct order for a wrong order

and if the arbitrator's award was not set aside in whole or in part, it had to be allowed to stand

unreversed...."

The Petitioner alleges bias on the part of the 3rd Respondent emphasizing the fact that the

appointment of the Inquiry Officer has been made by the Chairman. I take the view that it is

incumbent upon this Court to adopt proper principles on bias when assaying such allegations

of the Petitioner. A mere averment in reference to bias cannot be taken into consideration at

all times without adequate evidence thereto. His Lordship Justice A.H.M.D. Nawaz P/CA

(as he was then) in Sandresh Ravindra Karunanayake v. Hon. Attorney General and others

CA/Writ/63/2020 decided on 07.07.2020 p.15 has referred to a judgment (Webb and Hay v The

Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41, (1994) 122 ALR 41) decided by the High Court of Australia in 1994

where Deane J in the said case has identified the following three principles relating to bias;

First, there is the principle that no one should be in a position to decide a matter in which he has an

interest whether pecuniary or otherwise. Secondly, there is the principle of avoidance of partiality or bias.

Thirdly, we have the principle that justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done. In

such a backdrop the mere statement of the Petitioner that the 3rd Respondent was appointed

by the Chairman of the ITN is not sufficient to satisfy his claim on the rule against bias.

1 See Thajudeen v. Sri Lanka Tea Board and another [1981] 2 SLR 471

Page 8 of 12

Further, the Petitioner submits that allowing the prosecution to lead evidence on his personal

documents without amending the list of documents would amount to a violation of Clause

14.8 of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments Code ('E-Code'). As opposed to the said

argument, 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents contend that the Board of Directors of the ITN by way

of a board resolution (see 'R5') has decided to adopt the provisions of Volume II of the E-

Code only in the instances where the disciplinary orders of the ITN do not provide for certain

matters and when the Board of Directors have not taken a contrary decision on such matters.

I have no grounds to form a different opinion against the stand taken by those Respondents

on the applicability of the E-Code. It is pertinent to note that no adequate material has been

placed before this Court to distinguish between the ITNs own disciplinary orders and the E-

Code provisions which were previously adopted by the Board of Directors.

Furthermore, the Petitioner claims that the impugned disciplinary order 'P18' has been issued

by the General Manager of the ITN (2nd Respondent) and he is not the authorized person to

issue disciplinary orders and such conduct is in violation of Clause 23 of Chapter XLVIII of

the E-Code. In addition to my observations above on the applicability of the E-Code in respect

of disciplinary affairs of ITN, I must draw my attention to the doctrine of ratification referred

to by the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents. As mentioned by such Respondents, the said doctrine

stems from the Latin maxim 'Omnis ratihabitio retrorahitur et mandato priori aequiparatur'- every

subsequent ratification has a retrospective effect and is equivalent to a prior command. (See-

'Legal Maxims and Phrases' by Nanda Senanayake 1st Ed. April 2023 p.930). I see no reason

to reject the argument of the Respondents on this point of law mainly because there is no

conflict that emanates during these proceedings between the 1st Respondent, Chairman of

ITN and the 2nd Respondent, General Manager upon the impugned disciplinary orders.

Another main contention of the Petitioner is that the charge sheet marked 'P5' is ex facie

defective due to the following purported technical errors:

i. Omitting to mention the date and time of the offence in the charge sheet.

ii. No document has been attached to the charge sheet to establish the fact that the

Petitioner had worked at the 'Rasa FM' radio station.

iii. The frequency modulation (FM) or the date and time when the alleged

commentary was aired have not been mentioned.

Page 9 of 12

iv. Holding a disciplinary inquiry under a defective charge sheet is illegal,

irrational, unreasonable and procedurally improper.

The 1st 2nd and 4th Respondents have placed reliance on S.A. Nirosha Lalani v. Eastern

University of Sri Lanka CA/Writ/124/2016 decided on 16.09.2019 where His Lordship Justice

Mahinda Samayawardhena has held as follows;

"The charge sheets and the decision to terminate the services are challenged not on merits but

largely, if not solely, on the high technical ground that they did not emanate from the lawful

authority.

The Petitioner says that the charge sheet signed by the Vice Chancellor of the University is bad

in law as he is not the disciplinary authority of the Petitioner. According to the Petitioner, the

disciplinary authority of her is the University Council (of which the Vice Chancellor is the

Chairman2). The Respondents do not accept that position on the premise that her appointment

as the Senior Assistant Bursar is to the Swami Vipulananda Institute of Aesthetic Studies, which

is a Higher Educational Institute established under the Universities Act. In the facts and

circumstances of this case, however, there is no necessity for me to rule on that question as it is in

my view not decisive to arrive at the final decision in this case. Therefore I assume that the Council

of the University is the disciplinary authority of the Petitioner.

Then the Petitioner says that the termination of her services by the University Council (which

was done mainly upon the Disciplinary Inquiry Final Report marked 2R2) is bad in law as,

according to the Letter of Appointment marked P1, the appointing authority is the University

Grants Commission and therefore, in terms of section 14(f) of the Interpretation Ordinance3,

person who has the power to appoint any officer shall have the power to remove him.

However, this argument is not entitled to succeed because section 14(f) of the Interpretation

Ordinance is applicable when the legislature has not provided for the ground or mode of dismissal,

which is not the case here. In terms of section 45(2)(xii) of the Universities Act, the Council has

that power. This has also been acknowledged by the University Grants Commission by 2R7B.

2 Vide section 44(2) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978, as amended. 3 No. 21 of 1901, as amended

Page 10 of 12

Then the question is whether the decision to terminate the services of the Petitioner by the Council

can be quashed on the basis that the charge sheet was issued under the hand of the Vice Chancellor

without the proof of prior approval by the Council...

.... The high-flown technical objection that there is no documentary evidence that the University

Council approved the charge sheet before it was signed by the Chairman of the University

Counsel, does not, in my view, violate the audi alteram partem rule, which means, listen to both

sides before a decision is taken. That also does not violate the rule against bias unless there is

evidence to the contrary."

Having considered the above judicial pronouncement and the circumstances of this case I am

compelled to arrive at a finding that the alleged defects in the charge sheet are more towards

a cluster of objections which are technical nature. It cannot be assumed that those grounds

are strong enough to persuade this court to exercise the writ jurisdiction upon such allegations.

The Petitioner raising another claim asserts that allowing the prosecution, at the inquiry, to

lead evidence with a DVD (digital video disc) violates the provisions of Section 7 (1)(b) of the

Evidence Ordinance (Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995. In opposition to such argument,

the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents contend that a disciplinary inquiry is not obliged to abide by

the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance. I am of the view that the Petitioners argument

cannot be sustained unless he establishes an appropriate rationale to adopt the provisions of

the Evidence Ordinance during the course of the subject disciplinary inquiry. The attention

of Court has been drawn by the said Respondents to the decision in Asian Hotels and Properties

PLC v. Frederick S. Benjamin and others [2013] 1 Sri L.R. 407 where Dr. Shirani A.

Bandaranayake CJ has held;

Similarly, the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance, would not be applicable in an inquiry

conducted by the Labour Tribunal or by the Arbitrator. The Evidence Ordinance has clearly

stipulated the degrees of proof and the ascertainment of standards that are necessary for the

administration of justice. As the Labour Tribunals should dispense just and equitable relief, to

arrive at their decisions, they would not require strict degrees of proof that is required in a court

of law since there is no necessity to comply with the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance."

Page 11 of 12

Another grievance of the Petitioner is that the formal disciplinary inquiry has not been

conducted by a public officer in terms of Clause 17.6, 17.9 and 17.7 of Chapter XLVIII of the

E-Code and the objection raised in that regard has not been considered by the inquiry officer.

In a scenario where the Board of Directors of the ITN has not fully adopted all the provisions

of the E-Code, I am not inclined to make any decision here solely on the above provisions of

the E-Code. I am mindful of the fact that the E-Code, especially its' Volume II, deals with the

disciplinary control of all public officers other than public officers referred to in Articles 41,

51, 54 and 114(6) of the Constitution and members of the tri forces. I do not doubt the inherent

powers of this Court to consider the provisions of the E-Code in order to establish a criterion

that should have been adopted during the process of decision-making at the said formal

disciplinary inquiry. However, based on the circumstances of this case I am not convinced

that this is a fit case for me to formulate such a criterion to arrive at any finding in relation to

the proceedings of the said inquiry.

Now I must advert to inquire into the assertions of the Petitioner who claims that he has

obtained prior approval for the cricket commentary. He relies on the contents found in the

documents marked 'P8' to 'P10'. The dispute in the instant application revolves around the

provisions of clauses 9 and 10 of the contract of employment marked 'P2A'. The issues relating

to legal, ethical and business strategy can be included in any contract of service and it is not a

novel concept in the law of contract. Accordingly, any employee to agree to refrain from

engaging or participating in another undertaking or activity which competes with the current

employment or business is a usual condition in regard to their fiduciary duty to the company.

Such a clause in the contract of service is vital to any employer. An employee is certainly

bound by a non-compete clause, provided such conditions are clearly stipulated in a contract

of service. It is abundantly clear that clauses 9 and 10 of the contract of employment marked

'P2A' comes within the ambit of a 'non-compete agreement'. Thus, obtaining or granting

approval to engage in competing activities and undertakings should be done in a responsible

manner by an authorized officer. Hence, the defense taken by the Petitioner relying on the

documents 'P8' to 'P10' cannot be accepted as such documents do not disclose any lawfully

granted approval by an appropriate authority. No sustainable nexus is seen between the

Working Director who has placed an endorsement on P9 and the absolute management

authority of ITN.

Page 12 of 12

In light of the above, I am of the view that the matters referred to this Court by the Petitioner

for Judicial Review do not warrant this Court to exercise its writ jurisdiction. For

completeness, I need to draw my attention to the argument of the Respondents that the

Petitioner has invoked the prerogative remedies of this Court whilst alternative remedies are

available to him. The 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents describe a complaint to the Commissioner

of Labour under section 3(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act as one of the alternative remedies

available to the Petitioner. As I have observed in the aforesaid W. G. Chamila case, the well-

established principle is that Judicial Review is available if the alternative remedy is not

adequate and efficacious. It is not necessary for me to expand this Judgement to discuss the

alternative reliefs as I have already found that this Court should not exercise its writ

jurisdiction upon the matters referred to by the Petitioner.

In these circumstances, I hold that the Petitioner is not entitled to any of the reliefs as prayed

for in the prayer of his Petition. Therefore, I proceed to dismiss the instant Application.
