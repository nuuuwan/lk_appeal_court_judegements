B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd Accused) was charged for

the act of aiding and abetting the 1st Accused in soliciting and accepting a bribe on the

21st of September 2005.

After the trial, the learned High Court Judge convicted both the Accused on all

charges and gave a suspended sentence along with a fine. Being aggrieved by the said

conviction and sentence, the 2nd Accused lodged a petition appeal to this court, It should

be noted that the 1st accused did not challenge the said conviction.

The following grounds were urged by the counsel in his written submission.

1. Whether the Learned Trial Judge failed to appreciate that the appellant was the

subordinate officer of the 1st Accused and was subject to follow any command of the

1st Accused. Therefore, whether the mere presence of the Appellant in such instance

amount to abetment as defined in the Penal Code.

2. Whether the learned Trial Judge has adequately and correctly addressed the

Appellants evidence prior to rejecting it.

The facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that:

According to Manik Seniviratnalage Danasena (PW1), he was informed by his wife

Jayakodi Archilage Violet Nona (PW2) and his daughter P. Samudhra Jayathilaka (PW3)

that both Accused police officers had visited PW1s household on the 21st September of

2005, on the evening when PW1 wasnt at home with the intention of searching PW1s

house for the possession of illicit alcohol . They discovered the illicit alcohol from a shed

by the river at PW1s house. where PW1 was asked to come to the Naramala Police station

and meet one Meewawe(they had been referring to the 1st Accused) and also bring 30000/-

LKR to avoid filing a case against him for possessing and producing illegal alcohol or to

opt to bring 10000/- LKR for a much lesser punishment/trial. Further, according to PW3

the 2nd Accused had taken her national identity card.

Thereafter, PW1 discussed with his friend and decided to inform the matter to the

Bribery Commission. On the following day that is dated the 22nd of September of 2005

they lodged a complaint. Thereafter, officers from the Bribery Commission arranged a

plan to apprehend the Accused. On their direction PW1 along with the decoy PW8

Jayantha Samarawickrama Jayaweera, and the other officers traveled to Narammala

Town. Thereafter PW1 and PW8 met with both the Accused at the Naramala police

station. Upon seeing him the first Accused told him they have been waiting to meet him.

Thereafter, the 1st Accused directed PW1 and the decoy to meet him at a shop nearby.

Upon reaching the shop, the 1st Accused directed them towards another shop. PW1

and PW8 had thereafter entered the second shop and upon the arrival of the 1st and 2nd

Accused, the 1st accused prompted in demanding the money. Later he agreed to accept the

5000/- LKR in the presence of the 2nd Accused. Thereafter, the 1st Accused asked PW1 and

PW8 to head over to the gate of the police station along with the money in about 10 to 15

minutes. Thereafter upon PW1 and PW8s arrival, the 1st Accused requested that PW8

accompany him and that PW1s presence wasnt required. The 1st accused escorted PW8

to an unsolicited room situated at the back of the police station. After a period of 10 to 15

minutes PW8 informed PW1 that the 1st Accused fled from the scene after accepting the

money before he was apprehended.

When we analyse his evidence, it was spontaneous of him to inform the bribery

commission, his evidence was not shaken in the cross examination. Overall his evidence

was consistent.

This evidence corroborated with PW8 where upon arriving at the town, the 1st

and 2nd Accused arrived on a motorbike with a third person and upon stopping, the 1st

accused questioned them regarding the money.

Thereafter, the 1st Accused instructed the witness to go to a nearby shop and

upon residing in that shop, in the presence of the 2nd Accused, demanded the money from

PW1 to settle the case. Later, when both PW8 and PW1 went to the police station, the 1st

Accused took him behind the police station and into an unsolicited room, where the 2nd

Accused joined them later. In front of the 2nd Accused, the 1st Accused took the money

from PW8.

When we analyze the evidence, we can see that the 2nd Accused contribution is

not merely being passively present. As the defence counsel harped that he was a Junior

Officer to the 1st Accused therefore he only carried the orders from the 1st Accused and

that he never had the intention.

The following evidence which was not challenged by the 2nd Accused establishes

that not only was the 2nd Accused aware that the 1st Accused was taking a bribe, but his

contribution was intentional from the beginning as opposed to being a mere presence.

It should be noted that as confirmed by PW10 Chief Inspector Mohomed Ramseen

Noordeens evidence, the 2nd Accused had not reported to duty on the fatal day in

question, that is 22nd September 2005.

The main argument propounded by the counts for the accused was that the 2nd

accused was a junior officer and mere passive presence particularly due to the

uncompelling reasons without overt act or utterance would not establish the ingredients

of the offence of aid and abetting.

Under Section 100 of the Penal Code a person abets the doing of a thing who

1. Instigates any person to do that thing; or

2. Engages in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing; or

3. Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing,

Section 102 of the Penal Code provides that whoever abets any offence shall, if the act

abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is

made by this Court for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the

punishment provided for the offence.

For convenience, I reproduce Section 100 of the Penal Code Explanation 3.

It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing

an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that

of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge.

The commission of abetment can only be sustained if its conducted intentionally,

as an innocuous motive doesnt exonerate the Accused when intentional assistance

is established as found within the contents produced in this case.

The court is mindful of the Dictum of Canekeratne J in the case of Wijeyeratne v. Menon

48 N.L.R. 164;

To bring a person within section 107 of the Penal Code the abetment must be

complete apart from the mere presence of the abettor. It is necessary first to make out

the circumstances which constitute abetment, so that, if absent, he would have been liable

to be punished as an abettor and then to show that he was present when the offence was

committed (Ratanlal, 16th Edition, Law of Crimes, page 250).

In the case of The King v. Kadirgaman 41 N.L.R 534 Howard CJ, held that;

We agree that on this evidence it would not be possible to hold that the appellant

instigated the first accused to attempt the murder of Velupillai. On the other hand there

was evidence on which the Jury could find that the case came with in paragraph (2) and

(3) of section 100. The act of the appellant in holding Velupillai and pinning his arms

directly contributed to the commission of the offence by the first accused. More over there

was evidence that Velupillai was lured by the decoy, Nannian Kandan, to the place where

the assault was committed. Nagamuttu, the mother of Velupillai, also testified to events

that took place on the previous day which clearly indicated the intention of the two

accused to do Velupillai an injury. There is thus evidence that the first accused, the

appellant and Kandan were acting in concert. The act of each of them was therefore an

intentional aid in prosecution of the common object. This is not a case of mere presence at

the scene of a crime. From the nature and effect of the facility given by the appellant his

intentions must be presumed.

With the above dictums, this court can assess the 2nd Accused course of conduct

based on the evidence of PW8 and PW1.

This court is mindful in taking into consideration that the 2nd Accused had

intentionally assisted the 1st Accused from the beginning to the end, that is from asking

the bribe and to being present when the 1st Accused took the bribe.

Page 7 of 7

Therefore we hold that the 2nd accused was not a mere presence but who

intentionally assisted the 1st accused in accepting the bribe, the trial judge, has reached

a conclusion by accepting evidence placed before him. Therefore there is no reason for us

to disturb the findings of the trial judge.

We affirm the conviction and the sentence of the 2nd Accused, for the reasons

given this appeal is dismissed.
