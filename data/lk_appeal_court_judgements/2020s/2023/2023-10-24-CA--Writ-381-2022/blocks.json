It is the position of the Petitioner that even though the Petitioner was subjected to a one-year probation period and several warnings, such a probation and/or warnings would not amount to a bad disciplinary record as it is factually incorrect and could not affect his promotion to the rank of Colonel. Therefore, it is appropriate to examine the Petitioner's alleged bad disciplinary record. Anyhow I am mindful of the importance of discipline in the Army and the duties and responsibilities left with the Commander of the Army in controlling such.

It is evident from the said decisions marked R16, R17 and R18 of the Army Promotion Board that the Army Promotion Board has based its decision on the said erroneous recommendations of the respective Army Advisory Boards that the service record of the Petitioner was tainted with six disciplinary breaches. The Redress of Grievance (ROG) submitted by the Petitioner by P22 to clear the erroneous references made by the Army Advisory Board has also been rejected on the very same basis and the recommendation of the Advisory Board has been approved by the Commander of the Army by letter P30.",
