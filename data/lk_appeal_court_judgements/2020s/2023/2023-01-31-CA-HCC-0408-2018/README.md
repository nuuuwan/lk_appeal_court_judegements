the Offensive Weapon Act.

8. In the course of the same transaction for committing the offence of

Offensive Weapon Act.

9. In the course of the same transaction for committing the offence of

attempted murder of Ranawaka Arachchige Karunasena by using an

offensive weapon which is an offence punishable under Section 4(2) of

the Offensive Weapon Act.

As the Appellant opted for a non-jury trial, the trial commenced before a

judge and the prosecution had led 11 witnesses and marked production P1-

06 and X and closed the case. Learned High Court Judge having satisfied

that the evidence presented by the prosecution warranted a case to answer,

called for the defence and explained the rights of the accused. Having

selected the right to make a statement from the dock, the Appellant had

proceeded to deny the charges by way of his dock statement. The defence

called the wife of PW1, Deepani Rajapaksha but she had been treated as an

adverse witness by the defence.

After considering the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the

defence, the Learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellant as

charged on 07/12/2018 and sentenced him as follows:

1. Count 01 death sentence.

2. Count 02 10 years RI with a fine of Rs.5000/-. In default 06 months

simple imprisonment.

3. Count 03 10 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.5000/-.

In default 06 months simple imprisonment.

4 | P a g e

4. Count 04 10 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.5000/-.

In default 06 months simple imprisonment.

5. Count 05 10 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.5000/-.

In default 06 months simple imprisonment.

6. Count 06 20 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.10000/.

In default 06 months simple imprisonment.

7. Count 06 20 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.10000/.

In default 06 months simple imprisonment.

8. Count 06 20 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.10000/.

In default 06 months simple imprisonment.

9. Count 06 20 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.10000/.

In default 06 months simple imprisonment.

The Learned High Court Judge further ordered the sentence imposed on

Counts 2-5 to run concurrent to each other. Similarly, sentence imposed on

Counts 6-9 also ordered to run concurrent to each other.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. At the hearing the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. Trial Court flawed by perusing the police statement of PW1 at the time

of writing the judgment, in contravention of Section 110(4) of the CPC.

2. Inconsistent and self-contradictory versions of PW1, creates a serious

doubt as to whether he was an eye-witness to the bomb being hurled.

5 | P a g e

3. Trial court failed to evaluate the evidence of the police witness

Attanayake, which evidence is favourable to the accused and throws a

doubt on the prosecution version implicating accused-appellant.

4. Evidence of PW2 namely Hemalatha is inconsistent, unreliable and

does not favour the test of probability and the Trial Court failed to

evaluate the said evidence in its correct judicial perspective.

5. Evidence of PW4 namely Sampath is unsafe in view of the belated

statement to the police.

6. Inherent weakness in the evidence of PW3 namely Sylvia renders her

evidence of unworthy of credence.

7. No plausible reasons were adduced for the belatedness by PW3 and

PW4 and the Trial Court failed to address its judicial mind to the

belatedness.

8. Rejection of the dock statement is on an erroneous premise, thereby

causing serious prejudice to the Accused-Appellant.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

According to the eye witness PW1, he is the eldest son of the deceased. The

Appellant was their neighbour who was not in good terms with the deceaseds

family due to an unsuccessful attempt by him to marry deceaseds daughter

Sylvia (PW3). On the day of the incident when all family members with two

of their neighbours were watching T.V. at the living room, at about 8.45 p.m.

heard the movement of a person as the path leading to his house was laid

with gravels. When he looked at the main door, had seen the Appellant

tripping near the entrance and throwing something that resembled a black

coloured ball into the living room. The deceased having thought somebody

had thrown a stone into his house, picked up the same and went towards

the main door to throw the same out of the house. At that time that black

coloured object had exploded and the deceased sustained serious injuries

including losing a hand of him. The witness had seen the Appellant running

6 | P a g e

away from the scene after throwing the bomb. On a previous occasion the

Appellant was accused of throwing stones at the deceaseds house. Due to

this explosion the deceased was sustained serious injuries and was

pronounced dead on admission to the Wathupitiwala Hospital. Further his

mother PW2, his sister PW3 and his brother PW4 also had sustained injuries.

PW2, Hemalatha, wife of the deceased also corroborated the evidence of

PW1.When she was carried out by her neighbour Dayawathie, she had seen

the Appellant running from the scene. For her injuries she was taken to the

Radawana Hospital for treatment.

PW3, Sylvia while confirming the evidence given by PW1 and PW2, she

further said that she knew the Appellant since her childhood and the

Appellant had romantic interest towards her. As she did not like him, the

Appellant had harassed the deceaseds family in numerous ways. The

Appellant went to the extent of preventing potential suitors from visiting her

house. The Appellant had also threatened her when she refused his

advancement. More than 15 complaints had been lodged in the police against

him during last 06 years before this incident. She was admitted to

Wathupitiwala Hospital for treatment.

PW4, Sampath, an adopted son of the deceased also corroborated the

evidence given by PW1, PW2 and PW3. He too knew the Appellant from his

childhood. He had identified the Appellant at the scene of crime. According

to him the Appellant was wearing a white coloured T-shirt and a pair of

trousers. According to him, two months prior to the incident the Appellant

had threatened that he would bump off the entire family of the deceased in

a day. As he sustained serious injuries, he was transferred to Colombo

General Hospital where he had received in house treatment for five days.

This witness had admitted there was a case filed against the deceaseds

family for causing grievous injuries to the Appellant in the High Court of

Gampaha. For which the deceased party had pleaded guilty and even paid

compensation to the Appellant.

7 | P a g e

PW6, Dr.Bisrul Haji had conducted the post mortem of the deceased held

that the death has caused due to cardio-respiratory failure following shock

and internal haemorrhage due to multiple injuries caused by bomb blast.

All injured persons had been examined by doctors and their respective

medico-legal examination reports had been marked during the trial.

PW13, A.Welianga, the Government Analyst had examined the productions

sent for analysis by the court. According to him the hand grenade was

discovered to be of Singaporean made with S.F.G. type lever, and to be within

the definition of an offensive weapon in terms of the Offensive Weapons

Act.

PW12, IP/Wijeratne had conducted the investigations along with a team of

police officers from the Krindiwela Police Station in this case.

As the appeal grounds 2,4,5,6 and 7 are interconnected, all will be

considered together hereinafter.

In the second ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the inconsistent

and self-contradictory versions of PW1, creates a serious doubt as to whether

he was an eye-witness to the bomb being hurled.

According to PW1, the Appellant was their neighbour who had created

enough trouble to deceaseds family due to his romantical advancement

towards PW3 for which she had refused. Due to this number of complaints

had been lodged against the Appellant. He had very clearly identified the

Appellant who ran away after throwing the bomb. This witness was recalled

for further cross examination for a second time before the trial judge who

succeeded the trial judge who heard this case first.

This position had been corroborated by the defence witness who had been

treated adverse by the defence. The Learned High Court Judge had

considered this evidence in his judgment. Hence no doubt whatsoever had

been created of the evidence given by PW1.

8 | P a g e

In the fourth ground of appeal the Appellant contended that the Evidence of

PW2 namely Hemalatha is inconsistent, unreliable and does not favour the

test of probability and the Trial Court failed to evaluate the said evidence in

its correct judicial perspective.

In this case, including PW2, witnesses PW1, PW3, PW4 and the defence

witnesses are eye witnesses. This had been endorsed by the Learned High

Court Judge in his judgment. They had clearly witnessed the incident while

they were watching T.V. Their evidence had not been contradicted on any

material point. The Learned Trial Judge had considered the evidence given

by PW2 in his judgment.

In the fifth ground of appeal, the Appellant contended that the evidence of

PW4 namely Sampath is unsafe in view of the belated statement to the police.

This witness was seriously injured in the bomb blast. As such he was

transferred to the Colombo General Hospital. After receiving treatment, he

was transferred back to the Wathupitiwala Hospital. He had remained there

for about 5 days. Even though the police officers had spoken to him, no

statement was recorded. The relevant portion of evidence is re-produced

below:

As he was unable to walk properly for about three weeks after the incident,

he was taken to Kirindiwela, Welihena for native treatment. As he was

sustained injuries in his legs he could not go to police until native treatment

was over. Hence, he had given his statement on 31/12/2000, nearly one and

half months after the incident. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

11 | P a g e

The witness had given plausible reasons as to why recording of his statement

was delayed. Hence, it is incorrect to say that relying on his evidence is

unsafe.

In the sixth ground of appeal the Appellant argued that inherent weakness

in the evidence of PW3 namely Sylvia renders her evidence of unworthy of

credence.

This witness had been subjected to lengthy cross examination on both

occasions. According to her, the Appellant had started troubling them since

she turned down his proposal. This troubling went into the extend that on

several occasions witnesss family went into hiding to escape from the

Appellant. Although 15 complaints were lodged the police could not concur

his atrocity. She came to attend deceaseds funeral from the hospital after

treatment. While she was in the hospital, several times the police had spoken

to her about the happening of the incident. But she was unaware whether

her statement had been recorded while she was at the hospital. She admitted

that she gave her statement on 25/11/2000, after the alms giving of her

deceased father. As she was mentally disturbed over to this incident, she had

not gone to the police station to give her statement until she became normal.

She had given very consistent evidence when she was subjected for cross

examination twice. She had identified the Appellant at the time of throwing

the bomb into her house. Therefore, her evidence cannot be considered of

unworthy of credence.

In the seventh ground of appeal, the Appellant contended that no plausible

reasons were adduced for the belatedness by PW3 and PW4 and the Trial

Court failed to address its judicial mind to the belatedness.

The Learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence of PW3 and PW4

in its correct perspective and decided act on their evidence. Further, even

though the Appellant contended that PW3 and PW4 had given their

12 | P a g e

statement to police late, but they had given plausible reasons as to why they

delayed it. Hence, accepting and acting on their evidence has not caused any

prejudice to the Appellant.

Due to aforementioned reasons, I conclude that the appeal grounds

advanced under grounds 2,4,5,6 and 7 have no merit.

In the third ground of appeal the Appellant contended that the trial court

failed to evaluate the evidence of the police witness Attanayake, which

evidence is favourable to the accused and throws a doubt on the prosecution

version implicating the accused-appellant.

The Learned Trial Judge in his judgment at page 537 had analysed the

evidence of PW9, SI/Attanayake. As the Appellant foregone his right to cross

examine the witness, the court has posted questions to the witness. By doing

so, the court has conducted an impartial trial in this case. Hence, it is

incorrect to argue that the Learned Trial Judge had not evaluated the

evidence of PW9. Hence, this ground also sans any merit.

In the eighth ground of appeal the Appellant contended that the rejection of

the dock statement is on an erroneous premise, thereby causing serious

prejudice to the Accused-Appellant.

Treating unsworn statement of an accused from dock as evidence has been

recognised and consistently followed in our courts despite the fact that

statement not being subjected to cross examination. It has to be treated as

other evidence which had been subjected to cross examination. Acceptance

of dock statement as evidence has been recognised in several land marked

cases in our jurisdiction.

13 | P a g e

In Kathubdeen v. Republic of Sri Lanka [1998] 3 SLR 10 the court held

that;

It is settled law that an unsworn statement must be treated as

evidence. It has also been laid down that if the unsworn statement

creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case or if it is believed,

then the accused should be given the benefit of that doubt.

In this case, the Learned High Court Judge had considered the dock

statement of the Appellant in his judgment at pages 541-543 of the brief. As

the Learned High Court Judge had considered the dock statement of the

Appellant in his judgment adequately, the judgment cannot be considered

as an invalid judgment. Further, the Learned High Court Judge had given

his reasons as to why he has rejected the dock statement and upheld the

prosecution version. Therefore, it is incorrect to argue that the rejection has

caused serious prejudice to the Appellant. Hence, this ground of appeal also

devoid any merit.

Now I consider the 1st ground of appeal raised by the Appellant. In this

ground the Appellant contends that the Trial Court flawed by perusing the

police statement of PW1 at the time writing the judgment, in contravention

of Section 110(4) of the CPC.

In Punchimahaththaya v. The State 76 NLR 564 the court held that:

Court of Criminal Appeal (or the Supreme Court in appeal) has no

authority to peruse statements of witnesses recorded by the police in

the course of their investigation. (i.e., statements in the Information

Book) other than those properly admitted in evidence by way of

contradiction or otherwise.

14 | P a g e

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment at page 530 of the brief stated

as follows:

The Learned High Court Judge only had referred the statement of PW1 to

iron out the misleading cross examination regarding occurrence of the

explosion. Although this is a misdirection but not suffice to overcome

overwhelming evidence adduced by the prosecution which consisted of

evidence of four eye witnesses. Hence, I conclude that this ground of appeal

has no significant impact on the prosecution case.

In this case, the prosecution has led uncontradicted cogent evidence to prove

the charges levelled against the Appellant. The Appellants previous and

subsequent conduct and the motive had further strengthened the

prosecution case.

15 | P a g e

Considering all the circumstances, I am of the view that the appeal ought to

be dismissed as there is no merit in the pleaded grounds of appeal. Hence, I

affirm the conviction and sentence of the Appellant and proceed to dismiss

his appeal.

Further, in this case the Learned High Court Judge had sentenced the

Appellant on counts 6,7,8 and 9 as well. As the said counts are alternative

counts to counts 2,3,4 and 5, I set aside the sentence imposed on counts

6,7,8 and 9.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
