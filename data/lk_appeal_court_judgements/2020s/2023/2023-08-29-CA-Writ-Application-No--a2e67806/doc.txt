Order delivered on: 29.08.2023

S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

This Order pertains to the issuance of notices of this Writ Application on the

Respondents. The facts of the case are briefly as follows;

In terms of section 19 (4) of the Land Development Ordinance, No. 19 of 1935 (as

amended) (the Ordinance) a Grant (P1) had been issued to the subject matter of this

action which is State land to the Petitioners fathers elder brother, Dingi Appu

Karunaratne. The Petitioner claims that he is entitled to be issued a State Grant to that

land which is in the extent of 01 Acre or a part thereof in the extent of 02 Roods and

36.2 Perches shown as Lot B in the Tracing No. H/LC/TISS2017/53 prepared by the

Surveyor General (P-44). The land is situated in the Thissamaharama Divisional

Secretariat area in the Hambantota District. Upon the death of Dingi Appu Karunaratne

on 20.10.2009, his spouse, Kusumalatha Abeywickrama succeeded to the land

mentioned in the Grant marked as P1 in terms of sections 49 and 72 of the Ordinance

(P-4). After the demise of Digi Appu Karunaratne the Petitioner assisted Kusumalatha

Abeywickrama to cultivate the land. Kusumalatha Abeywickrama died on 18.06.2011.

Since Dingi Appu Karunaratne and Kusumalatha Abeywickrama had no children, upon

her death the Petitioner continued to possess and cultivate the land mentioned in P1.

Dingi Appu Karunaratne had four brothers namely, Martin Karunaratne, Ariyasena

4

Karunaratne, Danny Karunaratne and Don Julius Karunaratne. Don Julius Karunaratne

is the father of the Petitioner. After the death of Kusumalatha Abeywickrama, disputes

arose over the land and the Petitioner repeatedly made requests from the State

authorities to issue a Permit to him for the land mentioned in P1 but his attempts failed.

Meanwhile, the Divisional Secretary of Thissamaharama (the 1st Respondent) decided

that Sirisena Karunaratne who is the brother of the Petitioner is the successor of the

original Grantee, Dingi Appu to the land mentioned in P1 in terms of sections 49 and

72 of the Ordinance on the basis that he is the son of Dingi Appu (P-12) and issued a

Grant bearing No. 52277 in favour of Sirisena Karunaratne. However, as it was revealed

later that Sirisena Karunaratne had obtained the Grant for the land falsifying and

mispresenting his identity as the son of Dingi Appu, steps were taken by the 1st

Respondent to cancel the Grant in the name of Sirisena Karunaratne. The cancellation

of the Grant was registered on 02.09.2015 (P-27) in the Land Ledger. Thereafter series

of inquiries were held by the 1st Respondent about the dispute to the land and

consequently, hereinbefore mentioned Surveyor Generals Tracing Bearing No.

H/LC/TISS2017/53 marked as P44 was prepared dividing the land into two lots

according to the possession of the land as Lots A and B. It is mentioned in the letter

issued by the 1st Respondent marked as P-53 that Sirisena Karunaratne possesses Lot A

in P44 in the extent of 1 Rood 03.80 Perches and the Petitioner possesses Lot B in the

extent of 2 Roods and 36.20 Perches. Thereafter since the 1st Respondent could not find

successor/ successors of the original Grantee Dingi Appu to the land mentioned in P1,

the 1st Respondent took steps to cancel P1 in favour of Dingi Appu and the subsequent

Grant in favour of Sirisena Karunaratne in terms of section 104 of the Ordinance and

registered the cancellations in the Land Ledger (P-57). On 25.07.2019, even though the

Petitioner was informed by the 1st Respondent that he would be considered to issue a

Permit to the land at the next Land Kachcheri (P-60), no steps have been taken to issue

a Permit to the Petitioner up to the date of the institution of this action. Meanwhile, the

Petitioner obtained a loan on 26.08.2020 from the 7th Respondent by mortgaging lot B

mentioned in P44 more fully described in Schedule II in the Petition on a document

marked as P-61. Thereafter the 7th Respondent started to possess and develop the land.

She applied for the water and electricity connections as well. Then the Petitioner sought

intervention of the State authorities to dispossess the 7th Respondent from the land and

to be issued a Permit in his favour. However, the authorities informed the Petitioner that

intervention is not possible since the 7th Respondent developed the land and the

5

issuance of a Permit would be based on the current possession of the land (P-65, P-70,

P-75, P-77, P-79). The Petitioner argues that in terms of the Ordinance, one or more

Respondents have a public legal duty to issue a Permit to the Petitioner for Lot B in

P44 which is more fully described in the II Schedule to the Petition and if one or more

Respondents take a decision to issue a Permit for that land in favour of the 7th

Respondent without taking into consideration the long period of possession of the

Petitioner it is unreasonable, unlawful and irrational. The Petitioner further argues that

the failure and/or omission on the part of 1st- 6th Respondents to issue a Permit to the

Petitioner is tainted with irregularity, unlawfulness, unreasonableness and ultra vires.

The substantive reliefs sought by the Petitioner in this Writ Application are, inter-alia,

c) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing any purported decision

of the 1st - 6th Respondents to issue a Permit to the 7th Respondent in respect of the

land described in Schedule II.

d) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing any purported decision

of the 1st- 6th Respondents to include the 7th Respondent as a person selected to

receive a Permit in respect of the land described in Schedule II.

e) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Prohibition preventing any one or more of

the 1st 6th Respondents from giving effect to any purported decision and/or

determination and/or future decision and/or determination to issue a Permit to the

7th Respondent in respect of the said land described in Schedule II.

f) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus compelling any one or more of

the 1st - 6th Respondents to cancel any Permit already granted to the 7th Respondent

in respect of the said land described in Schedule II.

g) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus compelling any one or more of

the 1st 6th Respondents to issue a Permit to the Petitioner in respect of the land

described in Schedule II.

Or in the alternative to prayer (g);

h) Issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus compelling any one or more

of the 1st 6th Respondents to issue a Permit to the most suitable person in terms of

the law in respect of the land described in Schedule II.

There is no evidence before this Court that one or more Respondents are above to take

a decision or already taken a decision to issue a Permit to the 7th Respondent or going

6

to include or already included the 7th Respondent as a person selected to receive a

Permit in respect of the land in dispute.

Wade and Forsyth in the book Administrative Law1, describe that,

a Writ of Certiorari is issued by the Court to quash an order passed by an

inferior court, tribunal, or quasi-judicial authority, whenever the authority has

acted in excess of its power, or without requisite jurisdiction, or has violated the

principles of natural justice A quashing order is issued to quash a decision

which is ultra vires whereas a prohibiting order is issued to forbid some act or

decision which would be ultra vires.

In Central Queensland Services Pty LTD v Construction, Forestry, Mining and

Energy Union2 case, it was held that Certiorari lies only to quash a "determinative"

decision and cited Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission3, where it was held that,

Certiorari would not lie to quash a Commission report because the report had

no legal effect upon an executive power over the applicant: his legal position

was not changed by the report, nor did the report or its findings operate as a

legal precondition to further administrative actions against him. Certiorari will

not be issued where the decision maker was only hearing arguments and

responding to the questions without making orders binding on the parties.

The Petitioner in the instant action seek a Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st to 6th

Respondents to issue a Permit to the Petitioner or the most suitable person for the land

in dispute. The discretion of selecting the suitable persons to alienate State lands and

issuance of Permits to the State lands are vested with the Respondents in terms of the

Ordinance and this Court has no powers to direct the Respondents in respect of issuing

Permits for the State lands. It could intervene by exercising its writ jurisdiction if the

decision of the Respondents in alienating the State lands is illegal, tainted with

irregularity, unlawfulness, and unreasonableness, against the principles of natural

justice and ultra vires ultra vires. Nevertheless, as stated before there is no material

before Court that the Respondents are going to take or have taken a decision to alienate

7

the subject land of this action to anybody or included or intending to include the 7th

Respondents name as a person selected to receive a Permit.

Under such circumstances, I hold that the Petitioner is not entitled to the reliefs sought

in the Petition and further that this Application is premature. The Court, therefore,

refuse to issue notices of this Writ Application on the Respondents. Application

dismissed. No costs ordered.
