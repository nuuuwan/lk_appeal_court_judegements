Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an application by the petitioner seeking to invoke the discretionary power

of revision vested with this Court in terms of Article 138 of the Constitution of

the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

The Petitioner is seeking to revise and set aside the order dated 01-04-2022

pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha, in the High Court of

Gampaha case number 251/2020.

Page 3 of 9

This Court had the benefit of listening to the learned Counsel for the petitioner,

as well as the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) who represented the

respondents, in order to determine the application.

The petitioner had been indicted by the Hon. Attorney General before the High

Court of Gampaha, of the indictment dated 30th September 2020, on the

following count.

1. 2017 1 2017 31

ISIS

Although the petitioner had been in remand custody when the indictment was

forwarded to the High Court of Gampaha, he has been subsequently released on

bail.

The indictment, together with its annexures had been served on the petitioner

on 4th August 2021, and read over and explained to him. The learned Counsel

who represented the petitioner has taken up a preliminary objection to the

charge before the petitioner entering his plea on the basis that the charge

preferred against the petitioner has no validity before the law, and cannot be

maintained, therefore, the indictment should be rejected.

After having considered the basis for the objection raised on behalf of the

petitioner, and having considered the submissions of both parties, the learned

High Court Judge of Gampaha has overruled the said preliminary objection by

the impugned order.

Page 4 of 9

It is on the basis of being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner has come

before this Court.

At the hearing of this matter, the main argument of the learned Counsel for the

petitioner was that the charge against the petitioner is on the basis that he failed

to provide information to the authorities that the person mentioned in the

indictment was in the process of organizing groups in collaboration with the

organization called ISIS, but during the relevant time period mentioned in the

indictment, the said organization named ISIS was not a prohibited organization

in Sri Lanka.

He drew the attention of the Court to the Extraordinary Gazette No. 2223/3 of

the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka dated 13-04-2021, where it has

been declared that any person who conspires to commit or attempts, abets or

engages in any conduct in preparation to commit an offence in contravention of

Regulation 3 of that Regulations, commits an offence, and shall on conviction by

the High Court of the Western Province established under Article 154P of the

Constitution holden in Colombo, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment not

exceeding 10 years. The Gazette has provided the list of proscribed organizations

for which the regulations become applicable.

The term ISIS is the reference to the organization called the Islamic State of Iraq

and Syria alias Al-Dawlah al-Islamia Dawlah Islamia, which is one of the

organizations proscribed.

It was the position of the learned Counsel that the mentioned ISIS was not a

prohibited organization during the time relevant to the charge against the

petitioner. The charge preferred against him was a charge unknown to the law,

hence, there was no basis for the Hon. Attorney General to prefer an indictment

against the petitioner.

It was his contention that the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha was

misdirected as to the relevant legal principles when the preliminary objection

was overruled.

Page 5 of 9

It was pointed out by the learned DSG that the petitioner has challenged the

same indictment by way of an application for a mandate in the nature of a writ

of certiorari in terms of Article 140 of The Constitution before the Court of Appeal

in CA (WRT) Application No. 74/2021, where their lordships of the Court of

Appeal, after having considered the relevant legal provisions had dismissed the

application on 26-03-2021.

It was the view of the learned DSG that knowing very well that his application

for a writ of certiorari to quash the indictment has been dismissed by the Court

of Appeal, the petitioner has taken up the same objection before the High Court

of Gampaha and the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha has correctly

overruled the objection. It was the position of the learned DSG that there exists

no basis for the petitioner to succeed in this application, and it was his view that

the application should be dismissed.

The mentioned Court of Appeal Writ Application judgement dated 26-03-2021 is

filed of record. It is clear from the judgement that the petitioner has gone before

the Court of Appeal seeking a writ of certiorari after the indictment was sent to

the High Court of Gampaha, but before the indictment was served on him by the

learned High Court Judge of Gampaha. It is also clear that the indictment has

been served on the petitioner on 4th August 2021, after the petitioners challenge

to the indictment before the Court of Appeal was decided on 26-03-2021.

It needs to be noted that the same learned Counsel has appeared for the

petitioner in the Court of Appeal application as well as before the learned High

Court Judge of Gampaha when this preliminary objection was raised. Therefore,

it is quite apparent that it was well within the knowledge of the learned Counsel

the fact that his application for a writ of certiorari to quash the indictment has

been unsuccessful. In fact, it had been brought to the notice of the learned High

Court Judge when this objection was raised before the High Court of Gampaha.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner has raised the preliminary objection on

the basis that the charge cannot be maintained because the mentioned

Page 6 of 9

organization of ISIS was not a prohibited organization during the period relevant

to the charge and the relevant Gazette has no retrospective effect. Hence, urging

the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha to reject the indictment.

It is clear that the Gazette relied on by the learned Counsel for the petitioner to

argue that the indictment should be rejected was not in existence when the Hon.

Attorney General decided to indict the petitioner by the indictment dated 30-09-

2020. The relevant Gazette is a Gazette published by the President of the

Republic as the subject Minister, under the powers vested in him to make

regulations in terms of section 27 of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary

Provisions) Act No. 48 of 1979.

For better understanding of the said Regulation, I will now reproduce it, which

reads as follows.

27. (1) The Minister may make regulations under this Act for the

purpose of carrying out or giving effect to the principles and

provisions of this Act.

(2) Every regulation made by the Minister shall be published in the

Gazette and shall come to operation on the date of such publication

or on such later date as may be specified in the regulation.

(3) Every regulation made by the Minister shall as soon as convenient

after its publication in the Gazette be brought before the Parliament

for its approval. Any regulation which is not so approved shall be

deemed to be rescinded as from the date of disapproval but without

prejudice to anything previously done thereunder. Notification of the

date on which a regulation is deemed to be rescinded shall be

published in the Gazette.

In the Gazette relied on by the petitioner, the subject Minister has identified

certain offences under the 3rd Regulation. In terms of the 5th Regulation, it has

been promulgated that any person who conspires to commit or attempts, abets

Page 7 of 9

or engages in any conduct in preparation to commit an offence in contravention

of Regulation 3 of these Regulations, commits an offence, and shall on conviction

by the High Court for the Western Province established under Article 154P of

The Constitution holden in Colombo, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment

not exceeding 10 years.

It is abundantly clear that by publishing these Regulations on 13-04-2021, the

Minister under the powers vested in him in terms of section 27 of the Prevention

of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act No. 48 of 1979 has identified and

determined that any person who engages with the organizations proscribed

under the Regulations in the manner set out in Regulation 3 shall be punished

after conviction before the High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo

as provided by Regulation 5 of the same Gazette.

The indictment under consideration is not an indictment preferred by the Hon.

Attorney General in terms of the Regulations made under the Gazette mentioned

by the learned Counsel for the petitioner. The indictment has been preferred in

terms of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act No. 48 of 1979

as amended. (Hereinafter referred to as the PTA).

The relevant section 2(1)(h) of the PTA under which the alleged offence committed

by the petitioner has been described reads as follows;

2 (1) (h). Any person who by words either spoken or intended to be

read or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise causes or

intends to cause commission of acts of violence or religious, racial or

communal disharmony or feelings of ill-will or hostility between

different communities or racial or religious groupsshall be guilty of

an offence under this Act.

It is abundantly clear the indictment has been so drafted to provide further

specific information as to the allegation against the petitioner, for him to further

understand the charge against him by informing that he failed to disclose to a

police officer, knowing well that the mentioned Mohamed Thassim Mohamed

Page 8 of 9

Saharan in collaboration with an organization called ISIS attempting to organize

groups within Sri Lanka in order to commit a crime.

It is the view of this Court that whether the organization called ISIS was a

proscribed organization within Sri Lanka or not is immaterial for the purpose of

filing an indictment against the petitioner in terms of section 05 of the PTA. It is

a matter for the prosecution to prove that fact, if it becomes a relevant fact to

prove the charge against the petitioner only at the trial stage of the action.

It is also clear from the indictment; the intention of the Hon. Attorney General

has been to charge him for the offence mentioned on the basis of the penalty for

failure to give information as provided for in section 5 of the PTA where a specific

penalty has been provided.

In terms of section 5 (1) (a) of the PTA,

Any person who knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that

any person is making preparation or is attempting to commit an

offence under this Act, fails to report the same to a police officer shall

be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction, be liable to

imprisonment either description for a period not exceeding 07 years.

It is clear that the Hon. Attorney General, after having considered the relevant

material placed before him, especially the confession alleged to have been made

by the petitioner has decided to indict him before the High Court of Gampaha

for an offence as mentioned in the indictment.

I am of the view that the position of the learned Counsel for the petitioner that

the indictment was wrong since the organization called ISIS was not a proscribed

organization during the time relevant to the charge has no merit.

It is my considered view that when the indictment was preferred to the High

Court, the Attorney General had the prosecutorial power to consider the offence

in terms of the mentioned sections of the PTA.

In the case of Vanik Incorporation Ltd. Vs. Jayasekara (1997) 2 SLR 365, it

was held that;

Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has

been occurred due to a fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but

only when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of

justice.

As considered above, I am of the view that no positive miscarriage of justice has

been occasioned to the petitioner due to the order of the learned High Court

Judge to overrule the preliminary objection raised on behalf of him.

The application for revision is, therefore, dismissed.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to forward a copy of this judgement to the

High Court of Gampaha for necessary information.
