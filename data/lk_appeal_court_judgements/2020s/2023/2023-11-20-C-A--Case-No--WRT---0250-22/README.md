ORDER

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. The four petitioners filed this application seeking writs of Certiorari,

Mandamus and Prohibition. Twenty-six reliefs have been prayed for in

the petition, including interim reliefs. Quit notices marked as P-16(a) to

P-16(d) have been issued to the petitioners by the 1st respondent Urban

Development Authority on the ground that the petitioners unlawfully

occupy several shops situated at a state land. The petitioners challenge

the said quit notices by this application.

Page 4 of 12

The learned counsel for the petitioner made oral submissions in

supporting the application. The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the

1st to 5th respondents, the learned counsel for the 6th respondent and

the learned counsel for the 7th and 8th respondents agreed to file written

submissions without making oral submissions. However, only the

written submission on behalf of the petitioners was filed by the given

date, which is the 20th October 2023. On 25th October 2023, written

submissions were filed on behalf of the 7th and 8th respondents,

apologizing for the delay and the learned Counsel for the 7th and 8th

respondents urged to consider the written submissions filed by him.

This order has to be made to determine whether the notices should be

issued to the respondents and whether the interim reliefs prayed for by

the petitioners should be granted.

Briefly, the facts relating to this case are as follows:

There was a lease agreement between the Urban Development Authority

(hereinafter referred to as the UDA) and the 6th respondent. The 6th

respondent had constructed a seven-story commercial building on the

land, which was leased out to the 6th respondent. However, due to the

reasons explained in the petition, the said lease agreement had been

revoked by the UDA. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended

that on the fresh lease agreement marked P-18, the UDA leased out the

said premise again to the 6th respondent. The learned counsel for the

petitioner asserted that the UDA is going to eject the petitioners to hand

over the premise to the 6th respondent. The learned counsel pointed out

that in the District Court case bearing No. 00067/17/DSP, the

petitioners rights were decided without the petitioners being made as

parties. So, the complaint of the learned counsel for the petitioners was

that the rights of the petitioners had been decided without them being

heard. The learned counsel for the petitioners stated that by the order

of the Civil Appellate High Court in the case bearing

No. WP/HCCA/COL/14/2020 (LA), the UDA undertook not to take

actions against the 1st petitioner of the instant application (the plaintiff

Page 5 of 12

of the said case) to eject him without resorting to law, but even without

hearing the petitioners, the UDA issued quit notices to eject the 1st

petitioner and the other petitioners. The learned counsel contended

further that the respondents acted in violation of the rules of natural

justice.

In this application, the petitioners seek the reliefs prayed for in the

petition on the basis that the quit notices that were issued to the

petitioners are bad in law. The learned counsel for the petitioners also

contended that the UDA can take steps to get back the vacant

possession of this state land in terms of Section 3 of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act, but the opinion of the competent authority

must be formed in a reasonable way, and this court is vested with the

power to ascertain whether the competent authority has formed its

opinion in a reasonable way.

In addition, the learned counsel for the petitioners contended that the

petitioners were in possession of the premises for the last 19 years, and

although they were monthly tenants, they had the legitimate

expectation of continuing the possession of the premises in question.

The learned counsel for the 7th and 8th respondents stated in his written

submissions that the 1st respondent indicated its willingness to transfer

the leasehold of the subject property to the 7th respondent if the 6th

respondent pays off the arrears of rent on the subject property. It is

stated further that the 7th and 8th respondents paid off a debt of

Rs.41,926,158.17 to the 1st respondent in lieu of the 6th respondent

because the 1st respondent undertook to clear the subject property of

any lessees possessing the same.

Section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act (hereinafter

referred to as the Act) reads as follows:

3(1) Where a competent authority is of the opinion

Page 6 of 12

(a) that any land is State land; and

(b) that any person is in unauthorized possession or occupation

of such land, the competent authority may serve a notice on such

person in possession or occupation thereof, or where the

competent authority considers such service impracticable or

inexpedient, exhibit such notice in a conspicuous place in or

upon that land requiring such person to vacate such land with

his dependents, if any, and to deliver vacant possession of such

land to such competent authority or other authorized person as

may be specified in the notice on or before a specified date. The

date to be specified in such notice shall be a date not less than

thirty days from the date of the issue or the exhibition of such

notice.

According to the Interpretation Section, 18(h) of the Act, Competent

Authority" used in relation to any land means the Government Agent,

an Additional Government Agent or an Assistant Government Agent of

the district in which the land is situated and, includes;

(h) the head of any other Government Department or Institution

being a department or institution created by law, where such

land is under the control of such department or institution.

The Director General of the Urban Development Authority is the head

of that institution and as the competent authority, he has acted in

accordance with Section 3 of the Act and sent quit notices.

There is no dispute on the fact that the land in question is owned by

the UDA. The petitioners admit that they are monthly tenants. It is also

not in dispute that the lease agreements bearing numbers 3475, 3476,

3477, and 3471 (marked as P6(a) to P6-(d)) are the lease agreements

between the UDA and the petitioners in respect of the premises

pertaining to this application. It is vital to note that in all four

agreements, the following clause is contained:

Page 7 of 12

2003.04.01

.

According to the aforesaid clause of the agreement, the only

requirement to terminate the monthly tenancy is to give one month's

notice. In such circumstances, the petitioners could not have a

legitimate expectation that they would be permitted to possess

and/occupy the said premises peacefully and without any disturbances

in the absence of a clear breach of the conditions of the lease

agreements because it is clearly stated in the lease agreements that the

monthly tenancy could be terminated by giving one months notice. To

terminate the tenancy by giving one month's notice, breach of any

condition in the agreement is not required. The UDA has leased out the

premises, and when they want to take back possession, the only

requirement to be fulfilled is to give one month's notice. Therefore, both

arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the

petitioners had a legitimate expectation and the competent authority

has not formed the opinion under Section 3 of the Act in a reasonable

way cannot be accepted. It is apparent that every step that has been

taken up to the stage of issuing quit notices has been done in

accordance with the law.

The other contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners was that

in the District Court of Colombo case bearing No. DSP/00067/2017, it

was decided to eject the petitioners from the property, considering them

as unlawful occupants in order to hand over the possession to the 6th

respondent without the petitioners being heard.

It is correct that the petitioners were not parties to the said District

Court action. The said District Court action was between the 7th & 8th

respondents and 6th & 1st respondents of this application. The said

action had been filed with regard to a dispute between those parties,

and in the said District Court action, it was not decided to eject the

Page 8 of 12

petitioners. According to the proceedings of the said District Court

action dated 09.03.2022, it was informed to the District Court that the

Minister's approval has been obtained in terms of Section 14(2)B of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession Act) to issue quit notices to eject

the petitioners as unlawful occupants. As stated previously, what is

required by law to eject petitioners from the premises is to give one

months notice. There is no requirement to have a court hearing and

obtain a decision from the court to eject the petitioners. Section 3 (1A)

of the Act specifically states that No person shall be entitled to any

hearing or to make any representation in respect of a notice under

subsection (1). According to the clause 1 of the agreements marked

P6(a) to P6(d), one months notice has been given to the petitioners to

handover the vacant possession of the premises. As mentioned in the

notices, the petitioners had to hand over the possession of the premises

on or before 30th May 2022. Therefore, the petitioners occupation after

30th May 2022 is unlawful and after 30th May 2022, they are liable to

be ejected.

One of the main contentions of the learned Counsel for the petitioners

was that the Ministers approval (P-21) is illegal, ultra vires, and

amounts to dictation and usurpation of the powers of the purported

competent authority. The learned Counsel for the petitioners contended

that the Minister in charge of the UDA cannot determine or dictate to

the Competent Authority what to do or how he is to discharge or

exercise his powers, duties, or functions. The learned Counsel for the

petitioners advanced these arguments because of the following portion

contained in the document marked P-21:

1979 7 ( ) 14(2)B

, 1981 58

() 1979 7

Page 9 of 12

( ) 14 (2)B

1979 7 3

.

The learned counsel for the petitioners contended further that the

Minister of Urban Development and Housing had to grant only the

approval for the decision of the competent authority to get back

possession of the state land, but according to the document marked

P-21, the Minister has also given directions to eject the tenants. That is

why the learned counsel contended that the Minister directing the

competent authority, UDA what to do is illegal and ultra vires and the

quit notices issued as a result of the approval given by the Minister is

bad in law.

The UDA issued a notice on 5th October 2007 marked P-8 according to

the petition. In the said notice, it is stated that according to clause one

of the lease agreement, the petitioner has agreed to hand over

possession back to the UDA with one month prior notice. Accordingly,

the said notice states to hand over the vacant possession after 30 days

of the notice. Again, on 16th August 2019, the UDA issued quit notices

to the petitioners. Those quit notices have been marked as P10(a) to

P10(d). In the said quit notices, it is mentioned to pay the arrears of

rent in addition to giving notice to quit the premises in 30 days. In

response thereto, the petitioners sent a written appeal to the Minister

and the 1st and 4th petitioners instituted actions in the District Court of

Colombo bearing numbers DSP 202/2019 and DSP 203/2019. The 1st

and 4th petitioners sought an interim injunction, but the District Court

refused. Thereafter, an appeal was preferred to the Civil Appellate High

Court, Colombo, and subsequently, it was withdrawn.

Page 10 of 12

Again, on 29th April 2022, in terms of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act, quit notices P16(a) to P16(d) were issued to the

petitioners by the UDA informing to handover the vacant possession of

the premises on or before 30th May 2022. The Minister of Urban

Development and Housing granted approval to recover the vacant

possession of the said premises (P-21). The petitioners seek to quash

the quit notices marked P16(a) to P16(d) as well as the quit notices

marked P10(a) to P10(d) by this application. The petitioners also seek

interim relief to suspend the operation of the said quit notices until the

final determination of this application.

The Director General of the Urban Development Authority has signed

and issued the quit notices marked P16(a) to P16(d). According to

Interpretation Section 18(h) of the Act, as mentioned above, the Director

General of the UDA is the competent authority. The Director General,

as the competent authority, issued the quit notices P16(a) to P16(d) in

accordance with the law. Hence, there is no issue regarding the legality

of the quit notices issued to the petitioners.

The document P-21 is the approval given by the Minister in terms of

Section 14(2)B of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act. The said

approval has been given by the Minister of Urban Development and

Housing for the purpose of ejecting the petitioners and getting back the

vacant possession of the said premises to the Urban Development

Authority. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners was

that, apart from granting approval, the Minister cannot direct the

competent authority to eject the petitioners or to give directions with

regard to the other things that have to be done by the competent

authority.

Section 14 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act reads as

follows:

14(1) In the exercise, performance and discharge of his powers, duties

and functions under this Act a competent authority shall be

Page 11 of 12

subject to the direction and control of the Minister in charge of

the subject of State lands.

(2) A competent authority shall not exercise any power conferred

on him by section 3 in relation to any land vested in, owned' by,

or under the control of-

(a) the Sri Lanka Army or the Sri Lanka Navy or the Sri Lanka Air

Force, except with the prior approval of the Minister in charge of

the subject of Defence;

(b) the Urban Development Authority 'established by the Urban

Development Authority Law. No. 41 of 1978, except with the prior

approval of the Minister in charge of that Authority;

(c) the Sri Lanka Ports Authority established by the Sri Lanka

Ports Authority Act, No. 51 of 1979, except with the prior approval

of the Minister in charge of that Authority.

According to Section 14, although the competent authority identifies

the relevant land and decided to take back the vacant possession of the

land, obtaining the approval of the Minister is mandatory. To fulfill the

said legal requirement, the matter has been referred to the Minister.

Therefore, it is obvious that the decision to issue quit notices in order

to eject the petitioners from the premises has been taken by the

competent authority before forwarding it to the Minister for the

approval. Hence, the allegation that the petitioners are going to be

ejected as a result of the direction given by the Minister at the stage of

granting approval is baseless.

In addition, the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that

in P-21, the Minister had given directions to the competent authority

exceeding his powers to eject the petitioners is also baseless. I must

say that the Minister has not given a direction in P-21 to eject

petitioners. He has given approval in terms of Section 14(2)B for the

purpose of obtaining vacant possession of the premises by ejecting the

Page 12 of 12

tenants. That is why it is mentioned in P-21 that

.... Minister states that he gives

approval for obtaining the vacant possession. In addition to granting

approval, the Minister has never given a direction in P-21 to eject the

tenants.

In summary, the one-month's quit notices have been given according to

the lease agreements between the UDA and the petitioners. It has been

correctly referred to the Minister in charge of the UDA for approval in

terms of Section 14(2)B of the Act. The petitioners, as monthly tenants,

should vacate the relevant premises in 30 days after issuing the quit

notices marked P16(a)-P16(d). This was the 3rd time the petitioners were

noticed to vacate the premises according to their own petition. For the

foregoing reasons, it is apparent that no illegality occurred in issuing

the quit notices. The Ministers approval, P-21 is not illegal and ultra

vires. The approval has been given correctly in terms of Section 14(2)B

of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act. There was no violation

of the rules of natural justice. The petitioners could not have legitimate

expectations, as explained above. In the circumstances, I hold that

there is no legal basis to proceed with this application.

Accordingly, the application to issue notices to the respondents is

refused. The writ application is dismissed with costs fixed at

Rs. 75,000/-.
