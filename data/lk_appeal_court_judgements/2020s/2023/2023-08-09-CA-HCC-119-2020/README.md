Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted in

the High Court of Colombo on the 6th of October 2015 for committing the following

offences;

1. Trafficking 7 g of Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) an offence punishable under 54A(b)

of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13

of 1984.

2. For being in possession of 7 g of Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) under Section 54A(d)

of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13

of 1984.

Prosecution led evidence of thirteen witnesses, with marked production P1 to P10,

and closed the case. The Accused made a dock statement. At the conclusion of the trial,

the Learned High Court Judge found the Accused guilty and convicted him on both counts

and sentenced him to life imprisonment on each count.

Page 3 of 11

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Accused preferred this

appeal to this Court.

The Following are the Grounds of Appeal set out in the written submission:

a) Has the learned High Court Judge not given due regard to the contradictions

between the Prosecution witnesses?

b) Has the learned High Court Judge not given due regard to the dock statement of

the Appellant?

c) Has the learned High Court Judge not give due regard to the untrustworthiness

and weaknesses of the prosecution?

d) Is the Judgment contrary to the evidence?

The Facts and circumstances are that:

According to PW1, Police Inspector G.H. Susantha Silva, he received information

via his mobile phone from an informant on the 10th of October 2010, between 11:50 and

11:55, regarding the trafficking of heroin in a house situated at the end of a narrow lane

adjacent to St. Anthonys Shrine in Blumendhal.

Thereafter PW1 assembled a team of officers and embarked on the raid on foot

at 12:11. Upon arriving at 13:00 pm, they observed an individual seated on the ground of

the living room. As PW1 reached the doorstep, the Accused became excited and attempted

to escape. During the ensuing chase, PW1, who attempted to stop and search the agitated

individual, clashed with him, and they both fell off the steps at the front of the house.

Other officers assisted in apprehending him. The Accused was attired in a pair of brown

shorts and a white T-shirt at that time. A search of the Accused led PW1 to discover a

pink cellophane bag in the Accused's pants pocket; upon inspection, he identified a brown

powder within as heroin.

The Accused was arrested at 13:15, and notes were written regarding the arrest.

They left the scene at 13:30 and reached a pawn shop at 13:55 to weigh the bag, which

weighed 38g. They arrived at the Kottahena Police Station at 14:15 . At the station, PW1

Page 4 of 11

sealed the production with the Accuseds fingerprint and police seal, entering it as P.R

66/2010 (marked as P1), and handed over the production and the Accused to P.C. 79724

Rajapaksha (PW10). PW1 stated that he arrived at the Kottahena Police Station at 14:15

pm, as recorded on page 37, paragraph 38 of the I.B, and only thereafter sealed the

production. However, he also stated that the production was sealed at 13:55 pm, a time

which coincides with his visit to the pawn shop to weigh the bag. These inconsistencies

have been observed and the following questions have been posed by the prosecution.

Upon a careful examination of PW1's evidence, certain inconsistencies emerge that

give rise to doubt. Specifically, the timeline delineated in the testimony appears

Page 6 of 11

perplexing. PW1 stated that they left the pawn shop at 13:55 and arrived at the

Kottahena Police Station at 14:15. However, the testimony lacks clarity regarding the

precise time at which the production was sealed and handed over to PW10, leaving an

unexplained duration that engenders uncertainty as to when this crucial task was carried

out.

PW1 further testified that he had not opened the cellophane bag to examine the

light brown powder contained therein, a point that warrants scrutiny in the context of the

overall investigation.

In his cross-examination, PW1 revealed additional information that may bear

relevance to the case. Specifically, he stated that upon receiving a phone call at 11:45 from

the informant, he was notified only about heroin being trafficked at the particular

location, with no mention of the Accused or any other identifying details.

On Page 74 of the brief;

?]

: . .

PW1's testimony provides that the distance from the Police station to the specified

location was 1 km, and they arrived at the location at 13:00 pm after a walk of more

than 40 minutes. According to PW1, his knowledge of the precise location was limited,

relying solely on the information received from the informant. Upon reaching the

Blumendhal railway track, PW1 and his team took a turn onto the narrow path on the

right side of St. Anthony's shrine, leading to the house at the end of that pathway.

However, an apparent contradiction arises when considering the initial information

PW1 received, which directed him to turn onto the left side of St. Anthony's shrine. This

variance in direction illustrates a substantial discrepancy between the instructions

provided to PW1 and the route they ultimately followed to the specified location.

This inconsistency warrants careful scrutiny, as it raises questions about the

accuracy and reliability of the information upon which the operation was conducted.

.

It is also pertinent to note that the informant had not provided the name or a

detailed description of the Accused. We also observe that the team of officers travelled

during broad daylight armed with a T-56 gun. Even though there were several houses in

the vicinity, only PW1 noticed the house with an opened door where the Accused was

found residing. The explanation provided was that the other house was locked, leaving

only this particular house accessible.

On page 86 of the brief;

: . .

It is also important to note that PW1 received the information regarding the illicit

activities at 11:45 am but only reached the house at 13:00 pm, leaving a notable gap in

the timeline.

Upon arrival, the Accused was searched in front of the house. PW1 did not

investigate the house further after recovering the illicit drugs from the Accused, deeming

it unnecessary due to the absence of any other occupants. The Accused was arrested at

13:15 pm, and after spending 10 to 15 minutes at the location to record the entry in their

book, they left the place at 13:30 pm.

In a significant detail, PW1 stated that he did not open the pink cellophane bag,

asserting that his expertise was sufficient to identify the brown powder in the bag as

heroin. This claim might raise questions about the exact identification process used.

Further, PW1 indicated that the distance between the place of arrest and the pawn

shop was 1 km. Since it was a Sunday, the shop was closed; thus, PW1 had to

communicate with a worker who resided there to open the shop and complete the process

Page 8 of 11

of weighing the production. He later admitted that they set out to the Pawn shop from the

place of arrest at 13:30 pm.

We observe the following questions put forward by the prosecution in the re-

examination.

On page 109 of the brief;

. .

From the evidence presented by PW1, the court must grapple with significant

questions including that of how the officers would have conducted a search if the Accused

was a woman and about the decision-making of the officers involved. Notably:

The Method of Travel: What is the reason for the officers to travel on foot for a

distance of 1 km during daytime? The decision to go by foot raises concerns,

especially considering that PW1 received information about heroin trafficking at

11:45 am. A prudent officer would likely prioritize rapid response to ensure that

suspects do not leave the location.

Upon evaluating the testimony provided by this witness, it becomes highly

implausible that the events related to the pawn shop could have occurred within the

stated short time frame. Consequently, we find it necessary to reject PW1's account. Now,

shifting our focus to PW2's testimony.

PW2, H.G Jayasekara, a Police Sergeant, recounted that they initiated their

investigation into the reported heroin trafficking near the Blumendhal railway tracks

based on information received by PW1. PW2 proceeded to describe their journey to the

mentioned location, indicating that it was situated 60 meters down the road from where

the house identified by PW1 was located. Notably, PW1 had provided the exact address

" /62/65 , , 15," which was not supplied by the

informant and included details about the Accused's residence.

On Page 115 of the brief;

: 60

/ 62/65 , , 15

.

It is important to highlight that, in PW1's account, he had become aware of this

address only after the arrest of the Accused.

According to PW2's account, upon apprehending the Accused with the pink

cellophane bag containing the heroin, PW1 allegedly unsealed the bag and inspected the

brown powder. Drawing on his expertise, he identified the substance as heroin, discerning

this from its aroma and colour. However, it's important to note that in PW1's testimony,

there is no mention of him ever opening the aforementioned bag at any point during the

proceedings

On Page 117 of the brief;

: ?

:

.

.

During his cross-examination, he added that they possessed knowledge of the drug

trafficking location but lacked precise information about the house number. Nevertheless,

they were aware that the activity was taking place near the Blumendahl railway track,

Page 10 of 11

approximately 1 km away from the police station. The specifics of the house's number

were undisclosed, though they were instructed to proceed to the lane adjacent to the

shrine. The distance between the house and the shrine was estimated at 30 to 40 meters.

It appears highly unusual that, for a drug raid, they did not carry a pair of

handcuffs and chose to travel on foot to apprehend the Accused. It is customary for a

prudent officer to utilize a vehicle in such scenarios.

According to PW2, there were no residences located on the right side of that road.

However, PW1's testimony contradicts this by indicating that the houses on the right side

were shut. It's noteworthy that PW2 mentioned focusing solely on the left-hand side of

the lane during their search. Nevertheless, the information conveyed to PW1 regarding

the exact location of the house lacked specificity.

On page 138 of the brief;

: ?

:

, .

What is evident is that PW2 has presented two distinct versions: one during the

examination-in-chief and another during the cross-examination, in two different dates.

Additionally, he maintains that they refrained from conducting a search of the

house due to the absence of any investigative leads. Furthermore, PW1 took the initiative

to unseal the cellophane bag and inspect the brown powder, holding it in proximity to his

nose. Similarly, PW2 replicated the same action during the course of the procedure.

On page 149 of the brief;

Upon analyzing this excerpt, it becomes evident that PW2 has completely

contradicted the version postulated by PW1. Furthermore, he asserts that the pawn shop

they visited was a two-story building.

Page 11 of 11

When considering this evidence, a number of discrepancies emerge within the

witness evidences of PW1 and PW2. It is observed that the Learned High Court Judge

failed to address the vital inter se and per se contradictions in the accounts of the main

witnesses, PW1 and PW2, as well as the overall implausibility of the Prosecution's

evidence. Our perspective is that the charges against the Accused have not surpassed the

threshold of beyond reasonable doubt.

Taking into consideration all these circumstances, we are of the view that the

conviction and sentence of the Accused cannot stand. We set aside the judgment delivered

on 17.06.2020 by the High Court of Colombo. This Appeal is allowed.
