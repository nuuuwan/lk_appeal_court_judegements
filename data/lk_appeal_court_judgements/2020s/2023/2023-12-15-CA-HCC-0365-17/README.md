JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General for committing the offences

as mentioned below.

1. On or about the 24th of December 2010 at Vavuniya within in the

jurisdiction of the High Court of Vavuniya the Accused by being in

possession of a T56 automatic gun without a permit committed an

offence punishable under Section 22(3) of the Firearms Ordinance read

together with the Section 22(1) of the same as amended by the Act

No.22 of 1996.

2. Within the aforementioned day place and the course of same

transaction the accused by being in possession of 15 live ammunition

committed ah offence punishable under Section 9(2) of the Explosive

Ordinance of No. 21 of 1956 as amended by the Acts No.33 of 1969

and 18 of 2005.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Vavuniya. The

prosecution had led 04 witnesses and marked production P1-6 and closed

the case. The Learned High Court Judge having satisfied that evidence

presented by the prosecution warranted a case to answer, called for the

3

defence and explained the rights of the accused. The Appellant offered

evidence from the witness box and closed his case.

After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High

Court Judge had convicted the Appellant as charged and sentenced him to

life imprisonment on first count and imposed one-year rigorous

imprisonment to the second count. No fine was imposed on the second

charge.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given his consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid

19 pandemic. At the hearing, the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

The Appellant had raised following appeal grounds:

1. The statement received in terms of Section 27(1) of the Evidence

Ordnance cannot be used against him.

2. The infirmities in the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

The Appellant was arrested on 23.12.2010 at Vaddukotai Jaffna by PW1

SI/Thakshitha along with other police officers mentioned in the indictment.

PW1 was directed to conduct investigation by the Senior Superintendent of

Police Vavuniya upon an information received by the police. The Appellant

was suspected to be involved in a murder and a robbery committed in the

Vavuniya area.

The Appellant was brought to Vavuniya Police Station on 24.12.202 and a

statement was recorded. Upon information provided by the Appellant, a T56

4

gun had been recovered by the police from a place called Pattaikadu. The

investigation further revealed that the gun had been robbed from an Army

officer at the Moondrumurippu Army camp.

The production had been properly handed over to the reserve officer and was

taken to Government Analyst Department subsequently.

According to the Government Analyst the gun sent for analysis falls under

the category of automatic firearm.

It is trite law that the burden of proof is on the prosecution in all criminal

cases.

In The Queen v. K.A. Santin Singho 65 NLR 447 the court held that:

It is fundamental that the burden is on the prosecution. Whether the

evidence the prosecution relies on is direct or circumstantial, the burden

is the same. This burden is not altered by the failure of the appellant to

give evidence and explain the circumstances.

In this case no direct evidence is available but the case rests on the recovery

of a gun under Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

It is pertinent to note that for admissibility under section 27(1), of the

Evidence Ordinance, the fact discovered must be a direct consequence of

information provided by an accused who is in police custody. In this case a

gun was recovered upon the statement made by the Appellant.

Under Section 27(1) of Evidence Ordinance the relevant portion of the

statement need to be marked in the trial in order prove the recovery. For this

purpose, the statement of the accused may be edited by eliminating things

which are part of the evidence but which it is thought to be better that the

5

Court should not know, to avoid prejudicing him. This part may be the parts

which refer to the culpability of the accused.

In this case the prosecution used the portion of the statement of the

Appellant which led to the discovery of a gun by the police. After editing the

State Counsel had sought permission of the Court to mark the following

portion of the Appellants statement to the police. The relevant portion is re-

produced below:

Page 39 of the translated brief.

Q. Can you read out to Court, the section of the statement where there is

mention of the production?

A. (Read out in Sinhala Language) Aeya Pattakadu vala agalak yata

sanghavala thiyanava, ema sthanaya mata polisiyata soya denna

puluwan.[Emphasis added]

In Sinhala it reads th mgldvq j, w.,la hg i.j,d ;sfhkjd" tu ia:dkh ug

fmd,Sishg fidhd fokak mqjka'

The above portion of the statement of the Appellant was marked as P1 by the

prosecution which shows only the knowledge of the Appellant as there is no

any other evidence available to connect the Appellant with the crime. Further

the portion marked above does not speak about a gun and ammunition.

Hence, I conclude that this not a proper marking as expected under Section

27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

In the second ground of appeal, the Learned Counsel contends that the

Learned High Court Judge had not properly evaluated the evidence given by

the Appellant from witness box. The Counsel further argued that the

impugned judgment is a mere re-production of the evidence sans any

analysis and no reasoning for the conclusion.

The judgment delivered in this case contained only three pages. It only

contains the narrative of the facts of the case without giving any reason for

6

the conclusion. The Learned High Court Judge without giving a single reason

stated based on the facts stated above, I find the accused guilty of both

charges. Referring this, the Counsel for the Appellant contends that the said

judgment is not a judgment in terms of Section 283(1) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No.15 of 1979. As its sans any analysis of the case and reasons

for the decision.

283. The following provisions shall apply to the judgments of courts other

than the Supreme Court or Court of Appeal: -

(1) The judgment shall be written by the Judge who heard the case and

shall be dated and signed by him in open court at the time of pronouncing

it, and in case where appeal lies shall contain the point or points for

determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for the decision,

The Judgment is the end product of the Court proceedings. It is the

statement given by the Judge, on the grounds of the trial. The writing of a

judgment is one of the most important and time-consuming tasks performed

by a Judge. Further, writing of a judgment varies from Judge to Judge and

reflects the characteristic of a Judge. Every Judge, of every rank has his/her

own distinct style of writing.

Justice Sunil Ambwani, in his article titled The Art of Writing Judgment

states:

Before writing a judgment, a Judge must remember that he is performing

a public act of communicating his opinion on the issues brought before him

and after the trial by observing fair procedures. He is required to tell the

parties of the decision, on the facts brought before him, with application of

sound principles of law, his decision, and what the parties are supposed

to do as necessary consequent to the judgment or to appeal against it. It

is basically a communication to the parties coming before him for a

decision.

7

A judgment must begin with clear recital of facts of the case, cause of action

and the manner in which the case has been brought to the Court. A Judge

must have essential facts in mind, and its narration should be without any

mistake. The facts must come from the record and not from the abstract

and briefs without any partisanship or colour to its narration. The

importance of first paragraph of the judgment cannot be overemphasized.

It must answer the question as to how, when, where, what and why,

which is an advice given to judicial cubs. The readability of the opinion

improves if the opening paragraph answers three questions namely what

kind of case is this, what roles plaintiffs and defendants had in the trial,

and what are the issues, which the Court has to decide and answer, giving

sufficient information to the reader to proceed with reading the judgment.

The soul of a judgment are the reasons for arriving at the findings. These

are also called the opinion of a Judge. There is no rigid rule, as to how a

finding may be recorded. The Judge, however, should give his reasons. It

is not sufficient to say that he believes the evidence or agrees with the

argument. The Judge must give his reasons for such belief and agreement.

An elaborate argument does not always require elaborate answer.

In Moses v The State [1993] 3 SLR 401 the Court held that:

A duty is cast upon the Judges to give reasons for their decisions as their

decisions are subject to review by Superior Courts.

In Ibrahim v Inspector of Police Ratnapura 59 NLR 235 the court held

that:

A mere recital of facts is not sufficient compliance with the provisions of

Section 306(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

8

In this case the Learned High Court Judge had merely narrated the evidence

of the prosecution witnesses without giving any reason and acceptance of

evidence of the prosecution witnesses. Hence, the said judgment cannot be

considered as a valid judgment. As there is no proper judgment passed in

this case, I therefore, set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on the

Appellant.

Now, I consider whether this an appropriate case to send for a re-trial.

In this case the only evidence available against the Appellant is the purported

statement of Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance. There is no any other

evidence led by the prosecution. Under these circumstances sending this

case for re-trial will not serve any purpose.

Therefore, I acquit the Appellant from the charges levelled against him.

The Appeal is, therefore allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Vavuniya along with the original case record.
