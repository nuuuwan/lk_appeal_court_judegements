DECIDED ON: 11.10.2023

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The petitioner has filed this application seeking a Writ of Certiorari to

quash the document marked P-15, wherein it is stated that the permit

issued under the Land Development Ordinance (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Ordinance) to the petitioner is invalid. In the

alternative, the petitioner seeks a Writ of Mandamus directing the

respondents to issue a fresh permit to the petitioner in respect of the land

described in the petition. In addition, the petitioner sought a Writ of

Page 3 of 10

Prohibition to prohibit the respondents from taking any further steps on

the decision mentioned in P-15 and the notice marked P-18.

The 2nd respondent has informed the petitioner by the said letter dated

20.02.2020, marked P-15 that the permit dated 21.07.1994, bearing

No. //83/804 issued to the petitioner is not a valid permit because a

permit under the Land Development Ordinance cannot be issued to a

person under the age of 18 years and the petitioner was 16 years 1 month

and 19 days of age at the time of issuing the said permit.

According to the petitioner, his father, mother, his younger brother and

the petitioner occupied/lived on the land in issue from his childhood. when

the petitioner reached the age of understanding of matters, he came to

know that the said land they occupied was owned by the state and his

father did not have a permit or any authority to occupy the land. However,

they continued to live and cultivate the land. During this period, part of

their house which was built with clay and with a Cajun roof caught fire

and the petitioner believes that it was set on fire by certain persons with

the idea of chasing them away from the land. The petitioner repaired the

partially burnt-down house and continued to cultivate and live there.

Then, the petitioner wanted to build a permanent building in the land in

issue. He requested permission from the relevant Divisional Secretary

through the Grama Niladari of the area to construct a house and to carry

on a business in the said premise. The petitioner stated that the

Pradeshiya Sabha approved a building plan for the land in issue and the

said approved plan has been marked and submitted as P-4 with the

petition. According to the petitioner, he was not aware of the permit issued

in his name, so he attempted to regularize his occupation by obtaining a

permit, and then only he came to know that a permit had already been

issued to him. The petitioner has explained in his petition the chain of

events that took place. Subsequently, he has received the aforesaid letter

Page 4 of 10

P-15 indicating that the permit issued to him is invalid. Accordingly, the

petitioner has filed this application seeking the aforesaid reliefs.

The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th respondents filed their statement of objections

together and stated that one of the key criteria in issuing a permit is that

the permit holder should be over 18 years of age at the time of issuance of

the permit, and the petitioner does not qualify to hold a permit under the

Land Development Ordinance as the petitioner had not reached the age of

18 years at the time the permit was issued to him. Certain points have

been mentioned in the statement of objections, and it was claimed that the

petitioner has not come before this court with clean hands. Stating further

in the statement of objections that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate

any cognizable legal basis to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this court, the

respondent sought to dismiss the petitioners application.

The petitioner has filed the counter affidavit with the document marked

P-21. At the hearing, the Learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner

and the Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the 1st to 4th respondents

made oral submissions.

The Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner contended that the

petitioner with their parents occupied the land in question for a long time

and the petitioner cultivated and developed the land. He contended further

that without knowing that a permit had been issued in his name, the

petitioner attempted to obtain a permit to this land. The Learned

Presidents Counsel pointed out that the building plan was approved,

water supply and electricity were given and thus, the petitioner is entitled

for a permit. The Learned Presidents Counsel emphasized the fact that the

Commissioner General of Lands has directed to issue a permit to the

petitioner by the letter marked P-21 dated 16.08.2021 and according to

Page 5 of 10

the Section 4(2) of the Land Development Ordinance, the Divisional

Secretary has to give effect to the direction given in P-21 by the

Commissioner General of Lands but he failed to do so. Accordingly, the

Learned Presidents Counsel urged to issue a Writ of Mandamus

compelling to issue a permit to the petitioner in respect of the land in

question.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General appeared on behalf of the 1st to 4th

respondents contended that according to Section 76 of the Land

Development Ordinance, a permit cannot be issued to a person under age

of 18 years, as such, the permit issued to the petitioner is void ab initio for

the reasons set out in P-15.

Dealing with the direction given by the Commissioner General of Lands in

P-21, the learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that under the Land

Development Ordinance, the occupation of state land by unauthorized

occupants could be regulated but the petitioner at present is in

unauthorized possession of the state land in question. While appearing for

the 1st respondent, the Commissioner General of Lands, the Learned

Deputy Solicitor General further submitted that the procedure to obtain a

permit through Land Kachcheri is clearly laid out in the Ordinance and

P-21 has been issued by the 1st respondent without following the said

procedure. Since the initial permit was void, she argued that the petitioner

has to be considered in the same position as any other unauthorized

occupant of the state land. She contended further that the petitioner

should follow the regular land kachcheri procedure as every other person,

and that by failing to do so, the petitioner is trying to circumvent that

procedure by obtaining P-21 from the Commissioner General of Lands,

which is unreasonable. The learned DSG contended further that the

Page 6 of 10

petitioner has contrived with the officer holding the office of Commissioner

General of Lands to obtain P-21.

Answering the question paused by the Court about why the Divisional

Secretary did not respond to the letter P-21 or comply with the direction

given by the Commissioner General of Lands in P-21, the learned Deputy

Solicitor General submitted that proceedings were instituted against the

petitioner in terms of State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act in the

Magistrate Court and a quit notice was issued on 06.10.2020. In reply, the

learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner contended that instituting

Magistrate Court proceedings and not taking steps on P-21 clearly show

malice on the part of the 3rd respondent (Divisional Secretary). He

submitted that the Divisional Secretary must give effect to P-21.

Section 4 of the Land Development Ordinance reads as follows;

4(1) The Commissioner-General of Lands may from time to

time give general or special directions to a Government

Agent or to a land officer as to the performance of his

duties relating to land administration and may direct or

authorize any question of doubt or difficulty in

connection with such duties to be referred to the

Commissioner-General of Lands for decision.

(2) Any direction or decision of the Commissioner-General

of Lands shall be observed and given effect to by the

Government Agent or by the land officer as the case may

be.

According to the above section, it is apparent that the Commissioner

General of Lands has the authority to give directions to the Government

Agent or to the Land Officers and any direction or decision of the

Page 7 of 10

Commissioner General of Lands shall be given effect to by the Government

Agent or the Land Officer as the case may be. The letter P-21 sent by the

Commissioner General of Lands to the Divisional Secretary of Hambantota

contains Commissioner Generals decision and his direction to issue a

lawful document for the extent of land that the petitioner possesses. In

addition, the Commissioner General has informed the Divisional Secretary

to let him know if there is a special reason to get back possession of the

land to the state ejecting the petitioner from the portion of land that he

possesses.

Admittedly, P-21 was not replied. As requested by the Commissioner

General in P-21, the Divisional Secretary or any other government official

has not informed the Commissioner General any special reason to take

back the possession of the land in question to the state. Accordingly, the

Divisional Secretary neither replied to P-21 nor complied with the direction

given by P-21.

The Learned Deputy Solicitor General contended that the Divisional

Secretary has instituted proceedings in the Magistrate Court against the

petitioner to eject him. It is to be noted that P-21 has been issued after the

said Magistrate Court proceedings were instituted. In view of Section 4(2)

of the Land Development Ordinance, the Divisional Secretary has no

authority to disregard the direction given by the Commissioner General in

P-21. So, the Divisional Secretary cannot proceed with the Magistrate

Court action to eject the petitioner from the portion of land in question

when the Commissioner General directed to grant a lawful document

enabling the petitioner to possess the portion of land in question.

At least the 3rd respondent, the Divisional Secretary, did not inform the 1st

respondent, the Commissioner General, of any special reason to get back

Page 8 of 10

possession of the land to the state ejecting the petitioner when the

Commissioner General had asked to inform him if there was any such

special reason. The learned Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the

1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th respondents admitted that the Divisional Secretary did

not inform them of any such special reason and that no reply was sent to

P-21. Even if there was a special reason to get back the possession to the

state, unless the Commissioner General revoked his previous direction to

give the possession to the petitioner and directed him to get back the

possession to the state, the Divisional Secretary had no authority to

proceed with the Magistrate Court action to eject the petitioner. The

Commissioner Generals decision and direction contained in P-21 have not

been revoked by him or by any other government official who had the

power to do so.

While appearing for the 1st respondent, the Commissioner General of

Lands, the learned Deputy Solicitor General contended that P-21 has been

issued by the 1st respondent without following the procedure laid down in

the Land Development Ordinance. However, the learned DSG did not point

out any provision of the Ordinance that was not followed by the

Commissioner General in issuing P-21. In fact, no such provision could be

found in the ordinance, which the Commissioner General has not followed

in taking the decision contained in P-21. In addition, if the Commissioner

General has taken that decision not following the procedure laid down in

the land Development Ordinance or if the decision has been taken wrongly

for any other reason, the steps should have been taken to revoke the

Commissioner Generals decision. Admittedly, no such step has been

taken and the learned DSG admitted that no step has been taken to revoke

the said decision even up to the time of arguing this matter. Furthermore,

it appears that the Commissioner General has not arrived at an arbitrary

decision in making the direction contained in P-21. As the Divisional

Page 9 of 10

Secretary decided that the petitioner is a fit and proper person to issue a

permit, after adopting the procedure laid down in the Ordinance, the

petitioner has been issued a permit in 1994. Only the fact that the age of

the petitioner is less than 18 years has not been brought to the attention

of the Divisional Secretary when issuing that permit. The Commissioner

General has considered those circumstances, the long period of possession

of the petitioner and directed to issue a lawful document to the petitioner

to possess the portion of land in question. In addition, considering the fact

that it is not a fault of the petitioner that he was issued a permit in 1994,

the Commissioner General made the direction contained in P-21 to issue

a lawful document to the petitioner to continue with his possession to the

portion of land in question.

Therefore, the direction given in P-21 is valid and lawful. According to the

Section 4(2) of the Land Development Ordinance, the 3rd respondent, the

Divisional Secretary is bound to comply with the direction given by the 1st

respondent, Commissioner General of Lands.

Although it is stated in paragraph 25(h) of the statement of objections of

the 1st to 4th respondents that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate any

breach of statutory duty on the part of any of the respondents that would

entitle him to a Writ of Mandamus, there is a clear breach of statutory

duty on the part of the 3rd respondent, the Divisional Secretary, by not

complying with the direction given by the 1st respondent in P-21.

There is no doubt that the permit bearing No. //83/804 dated

21.07.1994 is not a legally valid permit as stated in P-15 because the

petitioner was under 18 years at the time of issuing the said permit.

Therefore, the Writ of Certiorari prayed for in the prayer (b) cannot be

granted. However, for the reasons stated above, a fresh permit should be

Page 10 of 10

issued to the petitioner on the direction given in P-21 by the Commissioner

General of Lands. Hence, I issue the Writ of Mandamus prayed for in the

prayer (c) of the petition directing the 3rd respondent to issue a new permit

to the petitioner in respect of the portion of land in question.

I make no order as to the costs of this application.
