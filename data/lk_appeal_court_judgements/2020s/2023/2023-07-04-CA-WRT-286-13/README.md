Mayadunne Corea J

The facts of the case are briefly as follows. The Petitioner is a public quoted company in Sri Lanka

incorporated under the terms of Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 and duly re-registered under the

terms of Companies Act No.7 of 2007 and engaged in commercial banking. The 4th Respondent

was recruited by the Petitioner in the capacity of a driver by letter dated 31st January 1995 [X2(a)].

The 4th Respondent lodged a complaint dated 12.09.2012 [P1] before the 2nd Respondent under

and in terms of the Termination of Employment (Special Provisions) Act No. 45 of 1971 as

amended, alleging that the Petitioner unlawfully terminated his services. The Petitioner states it

was summoned for an inquiry at the Labour Secretariat by way of a letter dated 26.09.2012 (P2).

Respondent delivered his order dated 13.08.2013 (P4) and held that the 4th Respondents services

have been terminated and therefore be reinstated in employment together with back wages without

disruption of service.

The Petitioner states that the aforesaid order is unreasonable and arbitrary as the 2nd Respondent

has failed to take into consideration the retirement age of the Petitioner as per his contract of

employment dated 31.01.1995. Hence this writ application.

Petitioners Complaint to Court

The Petitioner challenges the impugned order (P4) on two main grounds. Namely, the decision to

reinstate the 4th Respondent is bad in law, unfair, irrational, and arbitrary as the 4th Respondent is

over 55 years of age. Additionally, the Petitioner also states that the 2nd Respondent has failed to

take into consideration that since the 19th of March 2019, the retirement age for all employees in

the Petitioner Bank is governed by their respective Letters of Appointment and Circular No.

2009/003 dated 19.03.2009 (P6).

The second ground the Petitioner alleges is that there has been a failure to give proper reasons,

justifying and substantiating the Order directing the Petitioner to reinstate the 4th Respondent. The

Petitioner submits that the 2nd Respondent does not have the power to reinstate employees who

have passed the age of retirement, thus the Order is ultra vires.

The Petitioner states that it has a legitimate expectation to assume that the legal contract of

employment is binding between employer and employee.

The Petitioner is thus seeking the following relief,

e) Grant a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing P4 and the decision contained in

them.

Respondents objections

The application of the Petitioner is bad and/or untenable in law,

6

The Petitioner has deliberately suppressed and misrepresented material facts,

The Petitioner has failed to demonstrate any grounds to maintain this application thus the

application is ill-founded and without basis,

The Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that he has any right or entitlement to have and

maintain this application.

This Court will consider the said objections in due course.

It appears that the crux of the Petitioners argument is the retirement age of the employee. The

Petitioner contends that the retirement age is decided by the Petitioner unilaterally while the

Respondents argue against it.

The Petitioners case

The 4th Respondent was employed by the Petitioner as a driver in the year 1995. The Letter of

Appointment of the said Respondent X2(a) among other things, stipulates the retirement age as 55

years. This is not disputed by either party. However, the Petitioner by a subsequent Circular P5

had raised the retirement age to 58 years. The said Circular is issued on 19.09.2008.

The following year, the Petitioner issued another Circular marked as P6 whereby the said

retirement age was reduced back to 55. The said Circular reads as follows; Implement the Public

Administration Circular and set the retirement age at 55 years. The Circular makes the

retirement age back to 55 which is also the age the Letter of Appointment states. At this stage, it

is pertinent to note that by this Circular, the Petitioner also has given an option for the employees

to apply for an extension of services if they so desire. Further, the Petitioner by this Circular has

undertaken the burden to evaluate the performance and grant extensions till the age of 57 at the

discretion of the Management. The said Circular also permits the Management to grant extensions

till the age of 60 pertaining to highly skilled workers. The parties are not at variance that the 4th

Respondent does not fall into this category.

7

It is also not disputed that the 4th Respondent had made a request to grant him an extension before

reaching the age of 55 (X2(d)). This was replied to by the Petitioner by letter dated 21.3.12 (X2(e))

whereby they replied as follows, We refer to the appeal dated 01st March 2012 with regard

to the above and regret to inform you that the management has not considered your appeal

favorably.

The 4th Respondent subsequently prior to reaching his retirement age, on 14.08.2012 petitioned

the 2nd Respondent and sought an inquiry. This resulted in the Labour Commissioner holding an

inquiry which culminated with the impugned order P4. The Petitioner is not challenging the

holding of the inquiry nor the mode of holding or the procedure adopted. It is his grievance that

the impugned order is palpably bad in law, unreasonable, irrational, unfair, ultra vires, and

arbitrary, and lacks proper reasoning.

In challenging the said Order, the Petitioner argues that the reinstatement is wrong as the retirement

age of the driver as per the Letter of Appointment and as well as the applicable Circular P6 is 55

years. Thus, ignoring the said provisions amounts to the decision being bad in law. The Petitioner

also contends that as per the responsibilities of a driver, he should be able to work long hours and

work during the weekends and should be of sound mind, memory and be physically competent

and submits that the 4th Respondent in his age is unable to carry out the said responsibilities which

have not been considered by the 2nd Respondent.

It is also his contention that the 2nd Respondent had failed to give proper reasons to justify the

decision. This would be an opportune moment to consider the impugned order. The Commissioner

General in his Order has given consideration to the main point of contest which is the retirement

age of the 4th Respondent.

Retirement age

As per the submissions of both parties, the impugned order is challenged on the basis of the

Commissioner wrongfully coming to a conclusion on the retirement age of the 4th Respondent.

8

The Petitioners contention is that when the 4th Respondent was appointed as an employee of the

Petitioner, he was given a Letter of Appointment where it stated that the retirement age is 55. As

the Commissioner has correctly held, this offer has been accepted by the 4th Respondent when he

signed and accepted the Letter of Appointment, thus making the Letter of Appointment the contract

of employment.

However, subsequently in the year 2008, by Circular No. SCL 2008/043 dated 19.09.2008, the

Management of the Petitioner issued the Circular marked as P5 which increased the retirement age

to 58 years.

The Petitioner argues that when the decision stipulated in P5 was taken, it was purely a

management decision and therefore it was a unilateral decision taken by the Management as the

retirement age which is a condition in the contract of employment is decided by the Management.

The impugned order of the Commissioner.

The impugned order of the Commissioner (P4) in his reasons, has stated that as per Circular No.

2008/43 dated 19.09.2008, the retirement age of employment has been extended to 58 years

thereby amending the condition in the contract of employment pertaining to the retirement age.

He has further held that the said amendment as proved before him, has been done as a result of the

agreement between the employer and the employee. Thus, he had held that it amounts to a valid

offer and acceptance which constitutes a valid contract. Additionally, he has also held that the

reduction of the retirement age from 58 to 55 has been done unilaterally. Thus, in the absence of

an offer and acceptance, the said reduction does not attract the legality to constitute a valid contract.

Therefore, he has concluded that in the absence of a valid contract between the employer and the

employee, the said amendment will attract no legal validity.

In the Commissioners view, only document P5 attracts legal validity which stipulates the

retirement age to be 58. Therefore, the Commissioner has held that by P6, the retirement age of

the 4th Respondent was reduced to 55 without the prior consent of the Commissioner of Labour.

9

Thereby the said decision is in violation of the provisions of the Termination of Employment of

Workmans Act. Thus, it amounts to a termination.

Can the contract of employment be changed unilaterally?

This Court observes that once a Letter of Appointment is accepted, there is a binding contract

between the parties as the offer by the employer has been accepted by the employee. Hence a

unilateral change cannot be accepted.

In Sascon knitting company (PVT) Ltd. Vs Commissioner General of Labour and other SC

Appeal 52/2014 decided on 7.8.2020. it was held that The specific terms of employment agreed

to by the employee cannot and should not be varied many years after unilaterally by an

employer. The parties are not at variance that as per the original Letter of Appointment which is

the contract of employment, the retirement age of an employee is 55 years. However, in this

instance, the term of retirement which is a term of employment in the contract of employment has

been changed subsequent to the acceptance of the said contract by the employee. We observe the

retirement age has been changed not once but twice. The 4th Respondent employee has no objection

pertaining to the first change but the agitation lies against the 2nd change. The first change was

effected by Circular P5 which increased the retirement age, while the second change is done by

Circular P6 which reduced the age back to the pre-P5 position, that is to bring down the retirement

age to 55 years which is also the retirement age depicted in the Letter of Appointment. Thus, the

question arises as to whether the first amendment was also made unilaterally or made with the

agreement of both parties.

In response, the Respondents contended that over a period of time, the trade union to which the 4th

Respondent belonged, had agitated for better facilities for the employees of the Petitioner. One of

their main contentions was to increase the retirement age to 58 years. Hence, they argued that as

a result of their agitation and in consultation with them, the Management had agreed to increase

the age of retirement to 58 years and released the Circular increasing the age of retirement to 58.

10

As it was done in consultation and as a result of the agitation of the unions that represented the

workers, it is their contention that the amendment pertaining to the retirement age which is a

condition in the contract of employment was done with mutual consent. Thus, they argued that by

this Circular (P5), the amendment pertaining to the retirement age in the contract of employment

has been accepted by all parties. This position is not corroborated by the 4th Respondents evidence.

However, its pertinent to observe that the said Circular P5 does not refer to any consultation or

negotiation of the trade union with the workers. On the contrary, the said Circular says the decision

to extend the age has been done by the Founder Chairman and the Senior Management which

makes it a unilateral decision by the Management. We are pleased to inform that the Founder

Chairman and the Senior Management has decided to extend the retirement age limit upto fifty-

eight (58) years for all categories of staff. This will come into effect immediately.

At the inquiry, the 4th Respondent himself has given evidence which was marked as X1(c) in which

the 4th Respondent has informed that his consent has not been obtained to enhance his retirement

age to 58.

Further, he had submitted that in fact, as per the terms, the 4th Respondent had the ability to

terminate the employment contract before the retirement date after giving prior notice. Under

cross-examination, the 4th Respondent had specifically agreed that the decisions that are taken by

the Petitioner are taken without consultation of the employees and there is no evidence to show

that the 4th Respondent was consulted or the consent was obtained prior to amending the condition

of the Letter of Appointment extending the retirement age to 58.

12

The 2nd witness called on behalf of the worker was the secretary to the trade union, who submitted

that they had discussions with the Management to at least extend the age of retirement to 58 and

that said the extension was done as a result of agitations. However, the said witness has failed to

submit any documentary evidence to substantiate this submission. Further, the secretary of the

said union in his evidence stated that there is no collective agreement pertaining to the retirement

age. Under cross-examination, he has specifically agreed that there is no such collective

agreement.

The representative of the Petitioner who was a senior manager of HR, under cross-examination

further submitted that the decision to increase the age from 55 to 58 was also taken by the

Management.

- .

In view of the above evidence, we observe that while the secretary of the trade union to which the

4th Respondent belongs to testified that P5 is a result of negotiations and consensus, the 4th

Respondent himself has denied it. Also, the Petitioners witness has taken up the position that the

decision reflected in P5 is a management decision hence the fact that P4 is a result of consensus,

becomes a disputed fact. It is also pertinent to note that the Respondents have failed to produce

any documentary evidence, especially by way of correspondence between the parties pertaining to

the alleged negotiations that they had toward the increase of the retirement age. In our view, the

13

Respondents have failed to demonstrate to this Court that Circular P5 was a result of the

negotiations the trade union had with the management pertaining to the extension of the age limit.

In any event, it is trite law that the Writ court will be reluctant to act when material facts are in

dispute.

Accordingly, in view of the contradictory nature of the evidence given by the 4th Respondent and

his witness, and in the absence of any reference to demonstrate that the extension was granted as

a result of negotiation this Court finds that there is no sufficient material to establish that the

Managements decision to increase the retirement age to 58 was done on a request of the trade

union with the consent of the employees, which makes the said decision also a unilateral decision.

Thereafter, the parties are not at variance that the Management unilaterally took a decision to

reduce the retirement age to 55. In the given circumstances, the safest conclusion to come to is

that both decisions reflected in P5 and P6 have been taken unilaterally by the Management

subsequent to the employee entering into his contract of employment. Hence the Commissioner

erred when he held that the first amendment pertaining to the retirement age, as reflected in P5,

was made at the request of the trade union with the consent of both the employer and employee

and that there is an offer and acceptance which constitutes a valid agreement that is lacking in P6.

It is also pertinent to note that if the decision in P5 was taken as a result of negotiations between

the trade union and the employer, it was incumbent on the trade union to secure the said decision

into the contract of employment of the employees by way of an addendum or by entering into a

collective agreement. However, in the absence of such and especially as per the wording of P5,

the only conclusion this Court can come to is that P5 is a unilateral decision taken by the

Management.

It is also pertinent to note that this Court finds as stated above in this judgment, that there is no

material by way of documentary evidence to substantiate that the increase of the age of retirement

14

to 58 was done by obtaining the consent of the employees. In the absence of such materials, the

said extensions too cannot be considered to create a legally valid contract between the parties in

the absence of an offer and acceptance.

It is apposite to note that as per the 4th Respondents original Letter of Appointment, which is a

binding contract of two parties, the employees retirement age is specifically stated as 55. The act

of the Petitioner to send the 4th Respondent on retirement upon reaching the age of 55 will not

violate the original terms of the contract. It is also pertinent to observe that in the absence of any

documentary evidence to demonstrate that the enhancement of the retirement age was done with

the agreement of the employee, the said enhancement also would not attract any legality.

Legitimate expectation to work till 58

The 4th Respondent argued that in view of P5, he had a legitimate expectation to work till 58 years.

It was also contended that the said Respondent had obtained loans with that expectation.

However, the 4th Respondent has failed to demonstrate with documentary evidence that with this

legitimate expectation to work beyond 55, he has obtained loans and other facilities during the said

period. The said period is between the issuance of P5 and P6 which is roughly around 6 months.

In fact, under cross-examination, the 4th Respondent has specifically said he has not attempted to

obtain any loans during this period.

- .. 58

-

- ? -

15

As per the above evidence, we observe that the 4th Respondent has failed to demonstrate to this

Court, that he has obtained any loans with the expectation of working till 58. In the circumstances,

the 4th Respondent cannot have any legitimate expectation to work beyond the retirement age that

is stipulated in his Letter of Appointment in X2(a).

It is also pertinent to note that when the 4th Respondent accepted employment with the Petitioner,

the only expectation that he could have had was to work till he reached the age of 55 as his contract

of employment X2(a) specifically states that the has to retire at the age of 55. Subsequently, the

Petitioner on their own, has extended the said retirement age to 58 by way of a Circular. The plain

reading of the Circular as stated elsewhere in this judgment, only demonstrates that it is a sole

Management decision. The said Management decision has definitely benefitted the employees.

However, if the employer and employee had negotiated and come to the decisions contained in P5,

then it was up to them to incorporate it into the most important contract of employment that bound

the relationship between the employer and the employee. In the absence of such, the only

conclusion this Court can come to is that it is a decision taken by the employer for the benefit of

employees.

In our view, a decision unilaterally taken by the employer as reflected in P5 can always be revised

as long as it does not contravene or go beyond the minimum benefits offered to the employees by

their original contract of employment or provisions of any written contract in existence at the time

between the parties. By bringing in P6, the Petitioner has been careful not to contravene the

provision pertaining to the retirement age contained in the original employment agreement

contracted between the parties. The extension of services that has been granted to the employee to

work from 55 to 58 has been in operation only for a period of 6 months which thereafter has been

reduced back to the same term depicted in the original contract of employment. In the absence of

any collective agreement to reflect this enhancement of the retirement age, or an addendum to the

contract of employment which would have depicted that the retirement age had been raised to 58,

it is safe to come to the conclusion that the said enhancement was done only as a management

16

decision which the management had the right to revise at its will. Hence, in our view, the 4th

Respondents contention that by P4 he had a legitimate expectation to work till 58 cannot be

sustained.

Has the 4th Respondent accepted P6?

The next ground contended by the Petitioner was that the Commissioner has failed to appreciate

that the 4th Respondent has accepted Circular P6 and thereby has relinquished his right to object.

It was their contention that the 4th Respondent, without any objection had continued to work for

three more years after the Circular was issued.

The 4th Respondent contended that he had objected to P6 whereby the Management has reduced

the retirement age to 55. However, the 4th Respondent failed to submit any documentary evidence

to substantiate this position. The secretary to the trade union in his evidence submitted that once

Circular P6 was issued, they requested the Management to give them an opportunity for

discussions. However, the said opportunity has not been given. He further said that by letter dated

24.05.2011 X2(j), they have informed their objection to the unilateral action taken by the

Management to reduce the retirement age and has requested to cancel the said Circular. The

relevant portion of the said letter states as follows;

However, the Public Servants retirement age has now been set as 57 years and therefore we

request you to make arrangements to make the retirement age of the Bank 57 years in line

with the Public Administration Circular.

The Respondents witness in his evidence states as follows;

- 2011 24

58 55

- 58 55

-

According to this evidence, what is established is that the trade union too has objected to Circular

P6 issued in 2009, only in the year 2011 by their letter marked as X2(j). It is also pertinent to

observe that even in this letter, the trade union has failed to mention that the previous Circular P5

where the retirement age was increased was made as a result of their agitation or negotiations and

was done with the consent of the employer and the employee.

As stated earlier in this judgment, we find there is no documentary evidence to demonstrate either

the trade unions or the 4th Respondent had objected to Circular P6 when it was issued. What is

available is the evidence of the secretary to the trade union which only demonstrates that even the

trade union had objected to the said P6 only after two years, hence the Petitioners argument that

the terms of the Circular were accepted and acquiesced up until the objection two years later.

It is also pertinent to note that the 4th Respondent on 2012.03.01 by X2(d), has sought an extension

in view of reaching the age of 55. As per his Letter of Appointment which is the contract of

employment marked as X2(a), his retirement age is specifically stipulated as 55 years. The said

letter states as follows,

Your employment if not terminated earlier, shall, ipso facto ceases upon your reaching the age

of retirement which shall be 55 years.

18

In the said letter there is no provision to seek for an extension of services. It is not disputed that

the 4th Respondent had requested an extension of services upon reaching his retirement age. In

seeking an extension of services by X2(d), it appears the 4th Respondent too has acted under

Circular P6 as it is only by the said Circular, provisions were made to reduce the retirement age to

55 and also granted an employee the opportunity to seek extensions until he reaches the age of 57.

However, this is subject to an evaluation of his performance, and the exclusive discretion to grant

an extension or not is vested with the Management. Thus, in our view, the 4th Respondent himself

had submitted himself to P6 and accepted the terms and conditions of P6 when he utilized its

provisions and sought an extension. This letter has been replied to on 21.03.2012, where the

Management has declined to grant the said extension (X2e),

We refer to your appeal dated 01st March 2012 with regard to the above and regret to inform

you that the management has not considered your appeal favorably

Hence, your retirement date will be 11th September 2012 and you are requested to utilize

accumulated Annual Leave prior to retirement

If the 4th Respondent was objecting to the said Circular P6, he would not have acted under the

same and sought to obtain the benefits offered by the said Circular, that is, seeking an extension.

Considering all the evidence before this Court, it is our view that if the 4th Respondent was

objecting to Circular P6 he should have challenged and contested the validity of the said Circular

at the appropriate time. The said Circular has been issued in 2009. However, the 4th Respondent

nor the trade union has taken any steps to challenge Circular P6 or even to object to the said

Circular during that time period. The first document the trade union representative speaks of in

objecting to P6 as per his own evidence is in 2011. There is no evidence to demonstrate to this

Court which establishes that the trade union or the 4th Respondent has challenged P6 in any forum

when it was issued. The trade union has waited for more than 2 years until the 4th Respondent

reached the age of retirement to challenge the validity of P6.

The next ground urged by the Petitioner is that the 4th Respondent has requested and accepted his

terminal benefits upon reaching the retirement age under P6. It is the contention of the Petitioner

19

that when the 4th Respondent applied for the terminal benefits, he accepted Circular P6 and the

retirement. Thus, the argument that he is estopped from canvassing the retirement under P6.

Acceptance of statutory reliefs

In developing his argument on acquiescing with P6, the Petitioner further submitted that the 4th

Respondent had requested to obtain his terminal benefits. Thus adhering, consenting, and

acquiescing to the retirement age stated in the Letter of Appointment and P6 and therefore

submitted that the 4th Respondent cannot have a legitimate expectation of his retirement age to

extend up to 58 years. In support of this, the Petitioner has submitted a plethora of cases among

which Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka V Ceylon Mercantile Union III SRISK. LR and

Upali Management Service Ltd v Ponnambalam 2004 (1) SLR 331 were heavily relied on. This

Court has considered the said judgments.

The Petitioner also brought an argument citing Lanka Multi Moulds (PVT) Ltd v Wimalasena

Commissioner of Labor and others (2003) 1 SLR 143 where he submitted that once the

workman has obtained his terminal benefits, it amounts to him acceding to the fact that his services

have come to an end. Therefore, they argue that the Commissioner of Labour cannot reinstate him

with back wages as per P4, as he has already obtained his terminal benefits. It is also pertinent to

note that the 4th Respondent has never denied not obtaining the terminal benefits. It was the

contention of the Petitioner that the Commissioner has failed to appreciate the acceptance of

terminal benefits by the employer and consider if he can be reinstated when he has accepted the

said benefits.

It is common ground that to obtain the terminal benefits, the 4th Respondent should have requested

the same and also signed the documents requesting the same. Hence the contention of the Petitioner

is that the 4th Respondent has accepted that his employment has come to an end when he accepted

the said benefits. The 4th Respondent has failed to answer this to the satisfaction of the Court nor

has demonstrated to this Court adequate material as to how he obtained the terminal benefits.

The last paragraph of the impugned order states as follows,

20

1971 45

( ) ( ) 6

...

2013.09.11

.

In the order, the Commissioner has reinstated the 4th Respondent without a break in service and

with back wages. Thus, as per the impugned order, the 4th Respondent is entitled to his back wages

and reinstated from 2013.9.11. However, by this time he has sought and accepted his terminal

benefits thus creating a situation where he gets his terminal benefits and wages simultaneously.

The employee cannot accept the terminal benefits and also be employed in the same institution

and accept the salary while retaining the said terminal benefits. We find that the Commissioner

has totally failed to address the issue or consider the fact that the 4th Respondent had obtained his

terminal benefits when he ordered the 4th Respondent to be reinstated with back wages.

The Petitioner also contended that in view of the Letter of Appointment X2(a) and P6, the

workmens contract of employment has come to an end. Thus, it was their contention that the

TEWA will not be applicable in this instance.

Non-applicability of Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act as

amended

The Petitioner also contended that under section 3 (1) (c) (II) TEWA should not have applied to

the instant case. Thus, making the act of the Commissioner ultra vires. To get an understanding of

this objection it is pertinent to refer to the section. The said section states as follows,

Section 3. (1) The provisions of this Act, other than this section, shall not apply

(c) to the termination of employment of any workman who has been employed by an

employer where such termination was effected by way of retirement in accordance with the

provisions of

21

(ii) any contract of employment wherein the age of retirement of such workman is expressly

stipulated; or

Accordingly, it was the contention of the Petitioner that as per the Letter of Appointment and as

per P6, the retirement age of the 4th Respondent is specified and therefore, since the 4th Respondent

has reached retirement age there could not have been an inquiry under TEWA.

As per section 3 of the Act, it is clear that the provisions of the Act will not apply if it falls under

any of the conditions enumerated in section 3(1). As per section 3 (1) (c) (II), the operation of the

Act is excluded in circumstances where a workmans contract of employment expressly stipulates

the age of retirement. The contract of employment X2(a) specifically stipulates the age of

retirement to be 55. Thus, as stated elsewhere in this judgment, when Circulars P5 and P6 are

unilateral Circulars, they cannot attract any legal relationship between the employer and employee.

Hence what prevails is the contract of employment which is X2(a). Therefore, in the given

circumstances, this Court is inclined to agree with the Petitioners contention on the applicability

Suppression of material facts

Even though the Respondents raised the objection under the suppression of material facts, their

main contention was that the Petitioner has failed to annex the entire proceedings. This Court

observes that the Petitioner has pleaded that if the need arises, they be permitted to annex further

documents. Especially in prayer (b) and paragraph 10 of the petition. This position is admitted by

the Respondents as well. However, with the objections, the Respondents have submitted the entire

copy of the proceedings.

In the said circumstances, the Court has been furnished with the entire copy of the proceedings. In

the submission of the learned Counsel, he has failed to pursue the said objection nor has he

submitted to this Court as to the other relevant material that has been suppressed for the proper

adjudication of this case. Accordingly, we are not inclined to accept the said objection. The

Respondents have failed to substantiate the rest of the objections to the satisfaction of this Court.

Conclusion

Considering all these facts, this Court is unable to agree with the Respondents contention in

justifying the decision of the Commissioner which is marked as P4. Especially when the

Commissioner has gone on the basis of giving legality to Circular P5 and considering the same to

be a valid agreement that amended the contract of appointment in X2(a), but in our view he has

failed to apply the same test in coming to the conclusion pertaining to the validity of P6.

In coming to this conclusion, the Court considered the absence of any documentary evidence to

prove that P5 is an outcome of negotiations between employer and employee. In our view, if we

are to apply the same tests the Commissioner has applied to reject P6, we do not find any offer and

acceptance when the retirement age was purportedly amended by P5.

Therefore, for the reasons stated in this judgment, we are inclined to accept the Petitioners

submission that upon reaching the age of 55, the 4th Respondent has reached the age of retirement,

thus, making the order marked P4 bad in law. Accordingly, we are inclined to grant the relief

prayed in prayer (e) of the Petition.

Considering all the facts of this case and especially the fact that the 4th Respondent is no longer

employed from the year 2012, we do not intend to award any cost.
