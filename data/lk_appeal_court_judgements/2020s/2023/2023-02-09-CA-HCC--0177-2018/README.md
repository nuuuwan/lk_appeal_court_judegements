JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred as the Appellant)

was indicted by the Attorney General under Sections 54(A) (b) and 54(A) (d)

of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act

No. 13 of 1984 for Trafficking and Possession of 2.30 grams of Heroin

(Diacetylmorphine) on 18th January 2014 in the High Court of Colombo.

Following the trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the

learned High Court Judge of Colombo has imposed a sentence of life

imprisonment for both counts on 16th of November, 2018.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent for this matter to be argued in his absence due to the

restrictions of the Covid 19 pandemic. During the argument he has been

connected via Zoom platform from prison.

The Appellant has raised following appeal grounds in this case.

1. The Learned High Court Judge has wrongly rejected the defence

evidence and failed to give reasons for the rejection.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has shifted the burden of proof on to

the accused.

3. The prosecution has failed to prove the chain of production beyond

reasonable doubt.

4. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the vital

contradictions of prosecution witnesses.

PW1/SI Wanniarachchi who was attached to Police Special Task Force,

Kalubowila Camp, had received information from PW3 Sgt/14273 Mahesh

that a person will be engaged in trafficking drugs at the Gangaramaya Road

just passing the Werahera Junction in his three wheeler bearing No.WP-

AAG/6290. He had received this information on 18/01/2014 at 15.00 hours

and had reported the same to his superior officer and arranged the raid.

Having selected 08 other officers, they had left the Camp around 15:30 hours

after completing all formalities. First the team had reached Werehara

Junction and stopped their vehicle bearing No.KH-1240 passing 100 meters

towards Boralasgamuwa. While they were on surveillance, at about 16.45

hours the said three-wheeler had arrived there and stopped on the

Gangaramaya road as per the information. When the person who was in the

driving seat started calling somebody, the police team had surrounded the

three-wheeler and PW1 after introducing himself to the said person had

questioned whether he had any illegal substance in his custody.

After a body check, a cellophane bag was recovered from his trouser pocket.

As the contents of the cellophane bag reacted for Heroin (Diacetylmorphine),

the person who is the Appellant in this case was arrested immediately.

Although his three-wheeler was checked, nothing had been found in it.

After informing this to his superior officer, the team had proceeded to the

Police Narcotics Bureau and arrived there at 18:15 hours. At the Police

Narcotics Bureau, the weight of the substance was observed to be 14.40

grams and the production was sealed in front of the Appellant. After sealing,

the production was handed over to PW9/Sgt 887 Ramanayake under

production No.114/2014. The three-wheeler was entered under production

No.115/2014.

PW3, PC 14273 Mahesh who was a member of the raiding team, was called

to corroborate the evidence given by PW1.

After closing the case for the prosecution, as the evidence led by the

prosecution warranted the presence of a case to be answered by the

4 | P a g e

Appellant, the learned High Court Judge called for the defence. The Appellant

gave a statement from the dock and called two witnesses including his wife

in support of his case. Thereafter the prosecution had called witness PW13

in rebuttal.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person. In a case of this nature

the prosecution not only need to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt but

also ensure, with cogent evidence that the Appellant had committed the

offence.

In this case I consider it is prudent to address the appeal ground challenging

the chain of production which is very vital aspect in drug related offences. In

the third ground of appeal the Counsel contended that the prosecution has

failed to prove the chain of production beyond reasonable doubt.

Proving the chain of production is a very important task for the prosecution

in a drug related case. If investigating officers do not do their duty properly,

the chain of production can be successfully challenged in the trial. This is

because the prosecution always relies on evidence gathered by police officers

in cases of this nature.

In Perera V. Attorney General [1998] 1 Sri.L.R 378 it was held:

the most important journey is the inward journey because the final

analyst report will depend on that.

In Witharana Doli Nona v.The Republic of Sri Lanka CA/19/99 His

Lordship Justice de Abrew remarked thus;

It is a recognized principle that in drug related cases the prosecution

must prove the chain relating to the inward journey. The purpose of this

principle is to establish that the productions have not been tampered

5 | P a g e

with. Prosecution must prove that the productions taken from the

accused Appellant was examined by the Government Analyst

In the above cited judgments, the Court has highlighted the importance of

proving the production evidence in a drug related trial.

In this case after the arrest the production which was recovered from the

Appellant was held by PW1 until the party went to the Police Narcotics

Bureau for weighing. First a white sheet was weighted and the weight showed

3.28 grams. Thereafter the substance was put on the white paper and

weighed again. It showed 17.300 grams. After deducting the paper weight,

the net weight showed 14.40 grams. This had been properly sealed and

handed over to PW9. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

According to PW12, the Government Analyst when she weighed the

production the weight showed as 16.3 grams, this is 1.9 grams in excess to

the weight noted at the Police Narcotics Bureau. The Government Analyst

6 | P a g e

further said that the weighing machine used by them is accurate as it is

being checked every day before weighing. The relevant portion is re-produced

below:

As this is a significant weight discrepancy, the Government Analyst had

noted this in the Government Analyst Report which had been marked as P9

in the trial.

This discrepancy cannot occur in this case as the initial weighing had been

done at the Police Narcotics Bureau which is a specialist unit in the Police

Department to deal with narcotics. This unit is equipped with sophisticated

weighing machines and other equipment.

It is very important to consider at this stage whether the above-mentioned

discrepancy in handling productions in drug related matters cause any

reasonable doubt over the prosecution case as claimed by the Appellant. To

consider this issue it is very important to discuss our Higher Courts

approach with regard to handling evidence pertaining to productions in drug

related matters.

7 | P a g e

In Faiza Hanoon Yoosuf v. Attorney General CA/121/2002 it was held

that:

.. The prosecution must prove that, what was subjected

to analysis is exactly the same substance that was

detected in that particular case. In this regard the inward

journey of the production plays a dominant role and is most

significant.

As this weight discrepancy is a substantial fact, the prosecution had not put

relevant questions either to PW1 or to the Government Analyst to explain the

reason. Considering the pure Heroin detected in this case, this weight

discrepancy is very significant one which certainly have impact on the

outcome of the net result of the Government Analyst.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are

of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions.

As the weight discrepancy is not properly addressed in this case, I conclude

this ground of appeal has merit.

Next, I proceed to consider the second ground of appeal of the Appellant. In

the second ground of appeal the Appellant contends that The Learned High

Court Judge has shifted the burden of proof on to the accused.

In all criminal cases the burden always rests upon the shoulder of the

prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The Appellant is not

required to prove his innocence but if he decides to plead a general or special

exception of the Penal Code, then the Appellant has a duty of establishing

that the case of the Appellant comes within such exceptions. This burden is

imposed under Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance.

8 | P a g e

In H.M. Mahinda Herath v. The Attorney General CA/21/2003 in

Appellate Court Judgments (Unreported) 2005 at page 35-39 the court held

that:

Where it was held that in a criminal case burden is always on the

prosecution to prove the charge levelled against the accused beyond

reasonable doubt. The trial judge must always bear in mind that the

accused is presumed to be innocent until the charge against the accused

is proved beyond reasonable grounds.

In the judgment Learned High Court Judge has states as follows:

(Page 285 of the brief.)

;jo fuu kvqf oS fmdf fhdackd lr we;af;a" fuu iellrej w;a wvx.=jg f.k

we;af;a 2014'01'16 fjks osk ;a;slref.a ksjfia oS njgh' kuq;a ta nj ;a;sh iska lsis

idlaIshla Tmamq lr fkdue;'

The learned Counsel for the Appellant referring to the above-mentioned

portion of the judgment submits that the learned High Court Judge has cast

an extra burden on the Appellant to prove his innocence which is alien to

the standard of proof in criminal case. He further submits that this is a clear

misdirection which certainly vitiates the conviction of the Appellant.

The wording of the above cited portion of the judgment very clearly

demonstrates, that the learned High Court Judge had reversed the burden

of proof on the Appellant which is not in accordance with the basic rules of

criminal prosecution. Hence, this ground of appeal also has merit.

As the above considered grounds of appeal have merit and it certainly affect

the outcome of the case, I consider it is not necessary to address the

remaining grounds of appeal.

Considering the grounds of appeal advanced by the Appellant, the learned

Trial Judge should have considered the weight discrepancy in favour of the

Appellant. Further, reversing the burden of proof on the Appellant is a clear

9 | P a g e

misdirection which certainly vitiate the conviction. As the evidence presented

by the Appellant creates a reasonable doubt over the prosecution case, I set

aside the conviction and the sentence imposed by the learned High Court

Judge of Colombo dated 16/11/2018 on the Appellant. Therefore, he is

acquitted from both charges.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
