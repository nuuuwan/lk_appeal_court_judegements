MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioner in this Application is seeking an Order in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st Respondent dated 26-10-2018 (marked as P30), refusing to appoint the Petitioner to the post of Assistant Superintendent of Customs Grade II with effect from 15-12-1997 with all due salary increments as directed by the Cabinet of Ministers by its decision dated 27-03-2018 (P28). Further, an Order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to comply with the Cabinet decision dated 27-03-2018 (P28) by appointing the Petitioner to the post of Assistant Superintendent of Customs Grade II with effect from 15-12-1997 with all due salary increments (without back wages).

Factual Matrix in a nutshell:

The Petitioner was appointed as Trainee Development Programmes Assistant attached to the Department of Customs with effect from 01-07-1994, and thereafter, the Petitioner was appointed to the permanent and pensionable post of Tax Officer, Excise Directorate of Sri Lanka Customs with effect from 01-01-1997 (P3/R1). By notice published in Gazette No. 892 dated 06-10-1995 (P4), applications were called for the post of Assistant Superintendent of Customs Grade II. The Petitioner has sat for the examination held on 06-04-1996 and faced the interview conducted on 13-05-1997. The total marks obtained by the Petitioner at the examination and the interview was 189 (R3) and accordingly, he has been placed 145th on the merit list. However, approval had been granted only for the recruitment of 126 candidates on the total marks obtained. The Petitioner was not appointed to the said post on the basis that he failed to secure adequate marks.

A cabinet Memorandum dated 22-01-1997 (P5) was presented to the Cabinet seeking to give permanent appointments to graduates who were serving in various government institutions as trainees. According to P5, an additional 10% of the total maximum marks stipulated for a selection examination, an interview or a combination of the two are to be granted to graduate trainees having over two years of training when filling staff-level vacancies

in accordance with the relevant schemes of recruitment. The Petitioner states that in view of P5, he is entitled to obtain an additional 30 marks. P5 was approved by the Cabinet on 26-02-1997 (P6) and accordingly, the Public Administration Circular No. 13/1997 dated 13-06-1997 (P7) was issued. By letter dated 01-05-1997 (P8), the Petitioner requested the 1st Respondent that he be granted the reliefs stipulated in P6. The Petitioner further states that due to political reasons he did not receive the additional marks that he was entitled to in terms of P6 and P7.

The Petitioner states that the Review Committee appointed by the Cabinet has recommended that the Petitioner be granted the relief sought by him by appointing him to the post of Assistant Superintendent of Customs Grade II with effect from 15-12-1997. The Petitioner further states that on 27-03-2018 the Cabinet decided to implement the above recommendation (P28). The said Cabinet decision was communicated to the Director General of Customs by the Ministry of Finance by a letter dated 25-04-2018 (P29). By a letter dated 26-10-2018 (P30), the Director General of Customs informed the Ministry of Finance that in terms of the Circular marked as P7 the Petitioner was not entitled to the reliefs as prayed for on the basis that the said Circular was not applicable to the Petitioner.

In these circumstances, the Petitioner states that the decision of the 1st Respondent (P30) is illegal, unlawful, unreasonable, mala-fide and void in law, and therefore, seeks inter-alia a Writ of Certiorari quashing P30 and a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to comply with the Cabinet Decision (P28) by appointing the Petitioner to the post of Assistant Superintendent of Customs Grade II with effect from 15-12-1997 with all due salary increments (without back wages).

The Respondents move for a dismissal of this Application on the footing that;

1. The Petitioner is not entitled to any relief in terms of the

Circular P7. 2. The necessary parties are not made as Respondents.

First of all, I will have to determine whether the Petitioner is entitled to the relief as prayed for in terms of P7. The Cabinet

Page 8 of 9

Decision (P6), granting additional marks to the graduate trainees was made on 26-02-1997. It is pertinent to note that the date of implementation of the said Cabinet Decision was not stipulated in P6. The interview for the post of Assistant Superintendent of Customs Grade II was held on 13-05-1997. For the implementation of the said Cabinet Decision, the Public Administration Circular No. 13/1997 (P7) was issued on 13-06-1997. As per P7, the date of implementation of P6 is 13-06-1997. In these circumstances, the Petitioner was not entitled to the benefit of P6 as the date of implementation of the same was after the interview that he faced. It appears to this Court that there is a delay in issuing Circular P6. However, it has not been challenged before the Court of law. Hence, ex-facie, the Petitioner is not entitled to the benefits set out in P6 and P7.

Moreover, it is pertinent to note that only the graduate trainees are entitled to the benefit of additional marks in terms of Cabinet Decision P6, and that permanent employees are not subject to P6, which reads;

..Cabinet Paper 97/0379/100/007, a Memorandum dated 22-01-1997 by the President on Employment of Graduate Trainees approval was granted for the recommendations in the Memorandum.

It is established that, the Petitioner was appointed to the permanent and pensionable post of Tax Officer, Excise Directorate of Sri Lanka Customs with effect from 01-01-1997 (P3/R1). Since the Petitioner was not a graduate trainee at the time of the Cabinet Decision P6 (26-02-1997), he is not entitled to the benefits stipulated therein. In these respects, I am inclined to accept the contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor General that the Petitioner is not entitled to any relief in terms of P6 and P7.

Furthermore, at the relevant time period (1997), the appointing authority of the Assistant Superintendent of Customs was the Public Service Commission. Accordingly, the Public Service Commission had issued appointment letters to selected candidates. As per P4, the applications were called for the post of Assistant Superintendent of Customs Grade II by the Public Service Commission. The powers of appointment in respect of the

Page 9 of 9

relevant post were delegated to the Director General of Customs under Article 57 of the Constitution only on 25-11-2011 (R12). As such, at the relevant time, as the Public Service Commission was the appointing authority of the post in dispute, it is a necessary party to this Application, whereas the Petitioner failed to name the same as a Respondent.

The Cabinet Decision marked as P28, directing the implementation of the recommendations of the Committees appointed by the Cabinet cannot be considered in isolation as P28 originated from P6 and P7. Similarly, the Petitioner's claim also originated from P6 and P7. As I have already observed that the Petitioner is not entitled to any relief in terms of P6 and P7, I hold that he is not entitled to any relief under P28 as well. In those circumstances, it is the considered view of this Court that the decision of the 1st Respondent (P30) is lawful and within the purview of P6 and P7.

For the foregoing reasons, the Application is dismissed. I make no Order as to the costs of this Application.

Application dismissed. No costs.
