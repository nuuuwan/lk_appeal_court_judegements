A mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari is sought by the Petitioners against the Secretary

to the Ministry of Health- 1st Respondent, quashing Gazette No.2206 published on 11.12.2020

('P3'), which contains a notice of the said 1st Respondent. The said Notice, which is impugned

by the Petitioners ('Notice'), is in reference to the competitive examination for promotion to

the Public Health Management Assistant Service (supra grade) on merit basis- 2018 (2020).

The Petitioners are seeking an additional mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing

the Method of Evaluation particularly, described in paragraph marked 'P3(a)' in the said

impugned Notice. The alleged grievance of the Petitioners is that the introduction of the

requirement of obtaining a minimum of 50% marks in the written examination (conducted by

the Commissioner General of Examinations on behalf of the Health Service Committee of

the Public Service Commission) in 'P3(a)' is unreasonable, unfair and manifestly irregular.

The Petitioners further plead that such a decision of the 1st Respondent has been made without

lawful authority. Anyhow, it is reflected in 'P3' that the Notice, which includes the said

paragraph marked 'P3(a)', has been published as per the order of the Health Service

Committee of the Public Service Commission.

The Service Minute approved by the Public Service Commission (PSC) on 06.04.2017 for

the Public Health Management Assistants' Service is published in the Gazette Extraordinary

No. 2053/18 dated 09.01.2018 marked 'P2' ('Service Minute'). There is no dispute among the

parties that the PSC has delegated its' powers of appointment, promotion, transfer,

disciplinary control and dismissal of the public officers of the Health Management Assistants'

Service to the Health Service Committee of the PSC. The Respondents have annexed the

Gazette Extraordinary marked 'R5' in proof of such delegation of power.

The Respondents raising a preliminary objection assert that this Court has no jurisdiction to

hear and determine the instant Application in terms of Article 61A of the Constitution1, which

sets out the immunity of PSC and its' committees from legal proceedings. It is no doubt that

in terms of Article 61A of the Constitution, this Court has no jurisdiction to inquire into or

pronounce upon or in any manner call in question any order or decision made by the Health

1 The Second Republican Constitution (1978 Constitution)

Page 5 of 10

Service Committee of the PSC. When considering the said preliminary objection, this Court

at the outset needs to examine whether the above Notice published by the 1st Respondent in

'P3' is tantamount to decisions taken by the PSC or its' Health Service Committee.

The 1st Respondent Secretary to the Ministry of Health affirming an affidavit has submitted

that the Health Service Committee of the PSC had approved the requirement of obtaining a

minimum mark of 50% in the said written examination as a criterion. It is stated on the face

of the relevant Notice which contains the impugned paragraph marked 'P3(a)' that the said

Notice has been published as per the order of the Health Service Committee of the PSC. The

documents marked 'R3' and 'R4' imply that the said Health Service Committee has taken

cognizance in specifying a minimum mark to be qualified by the respective examination. The

Attorney General who represents the PSC in the instant Application has filed a motion on

28.07.2022 annexing a letter dated 21.06.2022 which is filed of record. It is a letter addressed

to the Attorney General by the Secretary to the PSC endorsing the fact that the Health Service

Committee of PSC had approved the impugned Notice of the 1st Respondent published in

Gazette marked P3. The overall circumstances of this case have influenced this Court to

accept the Respondent's version that the 1st Respondent has published the impugned Notice

in 'P3' after obtaining the necessary approval of the Health Service Committee of the PSC.

The contention of the Petitioners is that the 1st Respondent imposing a requirement by virtue

of the impugned Notice published in the Gazette P3 to attain a minimum mark of 50% in

the written examination is discriminatory. This reflects the fact that the Petitioners are

challenging an order or decision of a committee of the PSC which was illustrated earlier.

Thus, I am inclined to accept the proposition of the Respondents that this Court has no

jurisdiction to inquire whether the decisions reflected in 'P3(a)' are unreasonable or unfair as

pleaded by the Petitioners. In other words, reviewing the impugned decision by this Court

would amount to inquiring into or pronouncing upon or in any manner calling in question an

order or a decision made by the Health Service Committee of the PSC. Hence, the bedrock

of the Petitioners' argument fails as this Court has no jurisdiction to review the reasonability

or the legality of the impugned decision marked 'P3(a)'.

Nevertheless, it is now settled law that, despite the Constitutional ouster stipulated in Article

61A of the Constitution, the writ jurisdiction could be sought under circumstances where the

Page 6 of 10

person who made the impugned decision did not have any legal authority to make such a

decision. This aspect has been discussed by Shiranee Tilakawardane, J. PCA (as she was then)

in Katugampola vs. Commissioner General of Excise and others (2003) 3 SLR 207. Hence, what

needs consideration at this stage by Court is whether the said Health Service Committee has

approved the requirement of the minimum mark of 50%, which is reflected in paragraph

marked 'P3(a)', without any legal authority to do so. During such process of examination, it

is paramount to assess whether the introduction of the said requirement of a minimum mark

would amend or vary the Service Minute marked 'P2' and also whether the said Committee

has authority to amend or vary a service minute approved by the PSC.

The Article 55(1) of the Constitution stipulates that the Cabinet of Ministers shall provide for

and determine all matters of policy relating to public officers, including policy relating to

appointments, promotions, transfers, disciplinary control and dismissal. In terms of Article

55(3) and Article 55(5), the appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and

dismissal of public officers shall be vested in the PSC subject to the provisions of the

Constitution; the PSC shall be responsible and answerable to Parliament in accordance with

the provisions of the Standing Orders of Parliament for the exercise and discharge of its

powers and functions.

The PSC is authorized to delegate its' powers to committees appointed by the PSC under

Article 56(1) of the Constitution. In view of such Constitutional provisions, PSC is

empowered to delegate the powers of;

a) appointment,

b) promotion,

c) transfer,

d) disciplinary control and

e) dismissal

of such public officers.

The exercise of delegated powers is further described in Chapter II of the 'Procedural Rules

on Appointment, Promotion and Transfer of Public Officers and to Provide for Matters

Connected Therewith and Incidental Thereto', published by the PSC in Gazette

Page 7 of 10

Extraordinary No. 1589/30 on 20.02.2009. On a careful perusal of such Procedural Rules and

the above provisions of the Constitution, it emanates that the powers of the PSC upon Service

Minutes and Schemes of Recruitment are exclusively vested in the PSC. The Chapter IV of

the said Procedural Rules deals with Service Minutes and Schemes of Recruitment. This

illustrates that the PSC is not authorized to delegate its' powers of approving or amending

Schemes of Recruitment or Service Minutes to a committee. Moreover, a committee of the

PSC has no authority to amend or vary a service minute approved by the PSC.

The Petitioners contend that the impugned Gazette 'P3' amends the general conditions

governing the appointments in the public service based on merit basis by adding the following

provisions thereto;

05. Method of Evaluation. About 65% of the vacancies at the top level will be filled on

merit basis. For this, a minimum of 50% marks should be obtained in the written

examination conducted by the Commissioner General of Examinations on behalf of

the Health Services Committee of the Public Service Commission......

(Emphasis added)

It is observed that the general method of promotion is provided in Clause 10.3.1.2 and Clause

10.3.2.2 of the said Service Minute marked 'P2'.

10.3.1.2 Method of Promotion Appointments to a number of vacancies of not more than

35% of the total vacancies in Supra Grade shall be made on the results of a

limited competitive examination. The candidates who have satisfied the

qualifications shall be appointed after verifying their qualifications by an

interview board appointed by the Public Service Commission. The interview

shall strictly be for examination of the certificates by which the qualifications of

the candidates are proved and no marks shall be allocated in this regard. (Syllabus

and the marking scheme is given in Annex 09) (Emphasis added)

10.3.2.2 Method of Promotion Appointments equivalent to 65% of the total vacancies in

supra Grade shall be made on merit. For this purpose, priority shall be

determined on the order of the aggregate of marks of an Aptitude Test conducted

by the Commissioner General of Examination on behalf of the Public Service

Page 8 of 10

Commission and marks allocated on the basis of seniority and experience by the

board appointed by the Commission. Candidates shall appear or an interview

held by a board appointed by the Commission for verification of qualifications.

No marks shall be an allocated at that interview. (Annex 10) (Emphasis added)

According to Clause 10.3.1.2 of the said Service Minute the promotions to the supra grade

will be made based on limited competitive examinations, filling 35% of the vacancies of the

supra grade. Further, Clause 10.3.2.2 of the said Service Minute specifies that the promotions

to the supra grade will be made on merit basis, filling 65% of the vacancies of the supra grade.

Based on the above criteria, the Petitioners argue that setting out a minimum mark of 50%

has been done in a manner which is procedurally wrong and in violation of the aforesaid

Clauses 10.3.1.2 and 10.3.2.2 of the Service Minute P2.

It appears that the said Service Minute 'P2' does not prescribe a minimum mark a candidate

should achieve in the competitive written examination for him/her to be eligible to be

considered for the promotion. If the said 'P2' stipulates any condition in relation to the

minimum mark which should be obtained by a candidate, certainly the Health Service

Committee of the PSC has no authority whatsoever to make a decision which affects such

provisions of the said Service Minute. The Petitioners further contend that the respective

Notice in P3 has been published without properly amending the said P2 and the matters

not provided in the said Service Minute should be determined by the PSC by virtue of Clause

18 of the Service Minute. In that event, a reasonable question arises: Is the said Health Service

Committee to whom the abovementioned powers have been delegated, sanctioned to make

any incidental or consequential decision based on the power delegated by the Principal (PSC)?

It is essential to resolve such question by looking at the delegation of power to a delegate by

a principal in a different but topical perspective as discussed in the following cases.

In Tata Iron and Steel Co. vs. Workmen, AIR 1972 SC 1917, at p. 1922 it has been held;

"Now, the increasing complexity of modern administration and the need for flexibility capable of

rapid readjustment to meet changing circumstances which cannot always be foreseen, in

implementing our socio-economic policy pursuant to the establishment of a welfare State as

contemplated by our Constitution, have rendered it convenient and practical, nay, necessary, for

Page 9 of 10

the legislatures to have frequent resort to the practice of delegating subsidiary or ancillary powers

to delegates of their choice. The parliamentary procedure and discussion in getting through a

legislative measure in the legislatures is usually time-consuming. Again, such measures cannot

provide for all possible contingencies because one cannot visualize various permutations and

combinations of human conduct and behaviour. This explains the necessity for delegated or

conditional legislation. Due to the challenge of the complex socio-economic problems requiring

speedy solution the power of delegation has by now as per in necessity become a constituent

element of legislative power as a whole...."

The Registrar of Co-operative Societies and another vs. K. Kunjabmu and others AIR 1980 SC 350

at p.352 the Supreme Court of India has held;

"...Nor can Parliament and the State Legislatures visualise and provide for new, strange,

unforeseen and unpredictable situations arising from the complexity of modern life and the

ingenuity of modern man. That is the raison d'etre for delegated legislation. That is what makes

delegated legislation inevitable and indispensable..."2

It is true that our Constitution has authorized the PSC to delegate only the powers of

appointments, promotions, transfers, disciplinary control and dismissal of such public

officers. In a narrow interpretation, one may argue that such a Committee of the PSC has no

authority to make any incidental decisions in reference to appointments, promotions,

transfers, disciplinary control and dismissal. However, the discretion vested in such

Committee cannot be denied with such narrow interpretation and it is to be noted that the

mode of exercising such discretion should be decided by the said Committee itself.

The impugned decision refers to a promotion and as such there may be many decisions that

need to be taken to fulfil the exact requirements of the relevant Ministry during the process in

effecting the respective promotions. The promotions to various categories of public service

should be effected carefully and also considering the socio-economic policies and exact

requirements of the relevant Ministry or the Department. That should be carried out

according to the strength of the existing economic and human resources and based on the

Page 10 of 10

most viable and reasonable method of recruiting and promoting persons by looking at a wider

angle merely for the best interest of the majority of general public.

I take the view that as far as a Committee of the PSC exercises their delegated power without

amending, varying or disturbing the decisions of the principal, who is the PSC, such decisions

cannot be considered ultra vires. Hence, I am of the view that the Health Service Committee

of the PSC has the authority to make lawful incidental decisions which do not contradict the

decisions of the PSC, particularly, without superseding the Service Minute approved by the

PSC. Such lawful incidental decisions are needed for carrying out the duties of the said

Committee effectively within the scope of their delegated power. On a careful consideration

of the whole matter, I need to conclude that the Health Service Committee has taken an

incidental or consequential decision to approve the requirement of the minimum mark as

reflected in 'P3(a)' with due legal authority to make such a decision and it neither affects nor

creates an impact upon any of the provisions of the said Service Minute marked P2.

In light of the above, I hold that the Petitioners are not entitled to any relief as prayed for in

the Petition of the Petitioner. Therefore, I proceed to dismiss this Application.

Application is dismissed.
