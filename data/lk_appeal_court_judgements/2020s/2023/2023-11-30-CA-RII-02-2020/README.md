D.N. Samarakoon, J

The plaint has been instituted on 25th November 1994, twenty nine years ago.

The land is Pelengahawatte of 0A. 03R. 16P. The plaintiff, by the plaint gave

shares to 01st to 03rd plaintiffs, 01st to 03rd defendants, all relatives and to the

04th defendant, the only outsider.

The basis of the claim was that Kuruppu Arachchige Don Abraham Appuhamy

being the original owner, who died intestate leaving his seven children, the 02nd

and 03rd plaintiffs and 01st 02nd and 03rd defendants and K. A. Don Wijewardane

5 | C . A . R I I 0 2 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3

and K. A. Dona Rupawathie. Hence they inherited undivided 1/7th share each.

Don Wijewardane died leaving his widow Podimarakkalage Tecla Dorin Perera,

the 01st plaintiff and his siblings aforesaid upon which the 01st plaintiff got

undivided 1/14th share and the others undivided 1/7 + 1/14 = undivided 13/84

each.

The plaint said that Dona Rupawathie together with one Mallikarachchige Percy

Perera purported to transfer the entirety of the land upon deed No. 2018 dated

17th May 1994 to Jayatissa Wickremasinghe Gunasekera, the 04th defendant.

The 04th defendant, the only outsider, through a very brief Statement of Claims

dated 12th August 1996 claimed the entire land pleading prescription too.

Very soon there was a trial on 11th November 1996 before Hon. Dammika

Kitulgoda, Hon. District Judge of Mt. Lavinia. Plaintiffs were represented by

learned counsel. The learned counsel of the 04th defendant, the only outsider,

informed the Court that he has no instructions and hence he does not appear.

In a brief judgment dated 24th February 1997, Hon. Kitulgoda ordered the

partition of the land as per the shares given in the plaint. The 04th defendant too

received the share allotted to him in the plaint.

Interlocutory Decree was entered accordingly.

The 04th defendant filed an affidavit dated 03rd November 1997, after eight

months that he could not participate at the trial since he was suffering from

malaria. On tendering objections dated 23rd February 1998, the plaintiffs stated

that the case was fixed for trial (under the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 there

must be a call to fix for trial date) on 04th October 1996 and that the 04th

defendant had not even filed a list of documents and witnesses by then.

It was recorded on the Journal Entry dated 14th July 1998 that the learned

counsel for the plaintiff agrees to accept the medical certificate tendered by the

04th defendant. The matter was fixed for inquiry. As per the Journal Entry dated

6 | C . A . R I I 0 2 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3

18th November 1998, which was an inquiry date, the only decipherable entry in

Sinhalese means,

both parties move to fix for trial. Accordingly the I/D is set aside. Trial

for 17th March 1999.

In an interim injunction application by plaintiffs dated 05th December 2000 (page

196 of the Original Case record) it was stated that the case is pending upon an

inquiry under section 48(4) of the Partition Law on an application made by the

04th defendant.

There is a finality attached to an Interlocutory Decree of a Partition Case. It is

only subject to (except on an appeal) subsections 04 and 05 of section 48. The

relevant section is as follows,

Beginning of Quotation:-

Finality of Interlocutory and final decrees of partition

48. (1) Save as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the interlocutory

decree entered under section 26 and the final decree of partition entered

under section 36 shall, subject to the decision on any appeal which may

be preferred therefrom and in the case of an interlocutory decree, subject

also to provisions of subsection (4) of this section, be good and sufficient

evidence of the title of any person as to any right, share or interest

awarded therein to and be final and conclusive for all purposes against

all persons whomsoever whatever right title or interest they have, or claim

to have or in the land to which such decree relates and notwithstanding

any omission or defect of procedure or in the proof of title adduced

before the court or the fact that all persons concerned are not parties

to the partition action; and the right, share or interest awarded by any

such decree shall be free from all encumbrances whatsoever other than

those specified in that decree.

(4)

(a) Whenever a party to a partition action-

(i) has not been served with summons, or

(ii) being a minor or a person of unsound mind, has not been duly represented

by a guardian ad litem, or

(iii) dies before judgment Is entered and no substitution of his heirs or legal

representatives has been made or no person, has been appointed to represent

the estate of the deceased party for the purpose of the action, or

(iv) being a party who has duly filed his statement of claim and registered

his address, fails to appeal at the trial,

(d) Where the court grants special leave as herein before provided the

court shall forthwith settle in the form of issues the questions of fact and

law arising from the pleadings and any further pleadings which are relevant

to the claim set up in the petition only and the court shall appoint a date

for the trial and determination of the issues.

(e) Where the court determines any matter in issue in favour of the applicant,

the court shall in accordance with its findings amend or modify the

interlocutory decree to such extent and in such manner only as shall be

necessary to give to the successful party and to no other party or person

whomsoever, the right, title or interest to which such party is entitled, or in

the event of the applicant being found entitled to the entirety of the said land

forming the subject matter of the interlocutory decree the court shall set aside

the interlocutory decree and dismiss the action.

(5) The interlocutory decree or the final decree of partition entered in a partition

action shall not have the final and conclusive effect given to it by subsection (1)

of this section as against a person who, not having been a party to the partition

action, claims any such right, title or interest to or in the land or any portion of

the land to which the decree relates as is not directly or remotely derived from

the decree, if, but only if, he proves that the decree has been entered by a court

without competent jurisdiction.

End of Quotation.

The Court cannot embark upon a full trial, as it did in this case, upon an

application under section 48(4). It cannot set aside the Interlocutory Decree,

which it entered after the trial wholesale and lock stock and barrel, as it

purported to do on 18th November 1998.

It can receive pleadings and further pleadings which are relevant to the claim

set up in the petition only.

It is true that the 04th defendant claimed the whole land. But the investigation

is limited to his claim only.

On 08th October 2001 the 01st and 03rd defendants have purported to file a

Statement of Claims claiming undivided 13/84 share each. This is the share

allotted to them in the plaint and which was given by the Interlocutory Decree

dated 24th February 1997.

But a purported 05th defendant, Rev. Doctor Kananthe Dhammadinna Sthewira

has filed a Statement of Claims dated 08th October 2001. This was facilitated by

the wrong and irregular procedure followed by the learned district judges who

sat on the Bench on and after 18th November 1998.

It is interesting to note, that as per the caption at page 267 of the original case

record the 04th defendant is Jayatissa Wickremasinghe Gunesekera

and the 05th defendant is Jayantha Wickremasinghe Gunasekera.

9 | C . A . R I I 0 2 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3

As per the caption of the motion filed in this case by 04A and 05 defendants on

26.07.2023, the 04th a and 5th defendant is Rev. Kananke Dhammadinna alias

Jayantha Wickremasinghe Gunasekera.

The 05th defendant purported to set up an entirely new pedigree.

He said that of the land called Pelengahawatte of about 04 Acres the original

owners were Mallikarachchige Francina Prerahamy and Hiripitiyage Carolis Silva

who owned an undivided 1/10th of a share. He also pleaded that

Mallikarachchige Yohanis Perera alias Johanis Perera and Mallikarachchige

Charlis Perera who received that share from those original owners upon deed No.

16933 dated 23rd June 1909 the owners thereafter, out of whom, Johanis Perera

received further undivided shares upon deed No. 9237 dated 06th November

1924. The 05th defendant claimed on a deed No. 62 dated 05th November 1996.

What happened in this case after 18th November 1998 is a classic example of

what Dr. A. R. B. Amerasinghe J., said in Fernando vs. Sybil Fernando, 1997

in the Supreme Court as,

There is the substantive law and there is the procedural law. Procedural

law is not secondary: The two branches are complementary. The maxim

ubi ius, ibi remedium reflects the complementary character of civil

procedure law. The two branches are also interdependent. Halsbury (ibid.)

points out that the interplay between the two branches often conceals

what is substantive and what is procedural. It is by procedure that the law

is put into motion, and it is procedural law which puts life into substantive

law, gives its remedy and effectiveness and brings it into being,

the only unfortunate consequence being because the wrong procedure was

followed a wrong result having been achieved.

The meaning of ubi jus, ibi remedium is that where there is a wrong, there is

a remedy.

10 | C . A . R I I 0 2 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3

No one contend, that, the procedure followed in this case from the institution of

the plaint, up to the entering of the judgment and the interlocutory decree on

24th February 1997 was wrong. Since there was no wrong, there was no accrual

of a right to a remedy. The only exception to this was the medical certificate of

the 04th defendant because it was permitted under section 48(4)(a)(iv). It does

not seem to this Court because of the fact that the 04th defendant having not

tendered a list of documents and witnesses and having tendered his purported

medical certificate of malaria after a lapse of eight months from the trial, that,

his application was genuine. But it is too late in the day to argue so, because,

even a partition action is still civil litigation and evidence could be adduced

without being verified for their truth and veracity on admissions. That was how

the medical certificate was admitted. But, the wrong established by that

admission of the medical certificate is limited, limited under section 48(4)(d) by

the words, the pleadings and any further pleadings which are relevant to

the claim set up in the petition only,, which does not allow the filing of a

statement of claims by the 05th defendant.

The 04th defendant did not plead any deed in his petition dated 03.11.1997 (at

page 177 of the original case record). But the 04th defendant in his purported

statement of claims dated 06.03.2000 had purported to plead several deeds, No.

1924 dated 06.11.1924, No. 16933 dated 23.06.1909, No. 1126 dated

06.11.1933 and No. 2026 dated 06.01.1994. He further said that although he

had pleaded deed No. 2018 the vendors therein, the aforesaid K. A. Dona

Rupawathie and M. A. Percy Perera do not have title. Hence the 04th defendant

purported to set up an entirely new pedigree that he never pleaded in his petition,

which he cannot do under the section.

Thereafter a 09th defendant too has filed an Amended Statement of Claims dated

25th September 2002.

11 | C . A . R I I 0 2 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3

He also purported to plead deed No. 16933 dated 23rd June 1909. There was no

provision to accept this purported Amended Statement of Claims under section

48(4)(d) of the Partition Law.

At a certain stage, in the propagation of this wrong procedure giving rise to false

rights, it appears that 04A defendant and the 05th defendant have become one.

The learned district judge who purported to give a judgment (which is actually a

second judgment since section 48(4)(d) did not permit him to hold a full trial)

decided that neither the plaintiffs, nor the 05th defendant have established title.

His decision in regard to the claim of the 09th defendant was similar. Under

section 48(4)(d) he could have considered only the claim of the 04th defendant

who in 1997 tendered the medical certificate and no more. He had no right

whatsoever to consider any other claims including that of a 04A and 05th

defendant and 09th defendant.

In the High Court of Civil Appeal, the learned High Court Judge while agreeing

with the learned district judge that plaintiffs action should be dismissed, upheld

the claim of the 05th defendant on his purported Statement of Claims dated 08th

October 2001, which could not have been filed in law.

The Supreme Court has granted leave to appeal against the judgment of the High

Court of Civil Appeal, as it appears, on the basis that in a partition action a

declaration of title could not have been entered in respect of that 05th defendant,

which appears to be a distant echo of the illegality of the said purported

Statement of Claims dated 08th October 2001 caused by the wrong procedure

upon which it was admitted. The appeal was by the 09th defendant. But on 27th

November 2019 the said appeal was withdrawn.

Now the plaintiff petitioners before this Court in their application for Restitutio

in Integrum alleges that the 05th and 09th defendant acting in collusion

purported to come to an agreement attested by Mr. L. M. A. M. Wannigama,

12 | C . A . R I I 0 2 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3

Notary Public and transfer parts of lands purportedly depicted upon a plan,

nothing of which neither of them could do in law.

As per the above exposition of the legal position this Court does not consider

factual positions, if any, averred for the 04A and 05th defendant or the 09th

defendant, because even this Court is precluded from doing so under section

48(4)(d) of Partition Law.

But only in respect of the Preliminary Objection by the 04A and 05th defendant

in their Statement of Objections dated 26th October 2022, that,

The petitioners cannot have and maintain this application before Your

Lordships Court in as much as Your Lordships Court has no jurisdiction

to entertain this application for revision and Restitutio in Integrum in

terms of section 5C (1) and 5(C)(2) of the High Court of the Provinces

(Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 54 of 2006,

the following is adduced.

In respect of the question whether this court has jurisdiction to review judgments

and orders made by the Civil Appellate High Court, the case Gammeddalage

Nilanthi Munasinghe and others vs. Amitha Ariyawansa and others, C. A. RI

15/2018 must be considered. The following extract is reproduced,

Beginning of the Quotation:-

The learned counsel for the petitioner accepts that a party cannot by

way of a final appeal come before this Court against the Judgment or

Order of the High Court of Civil Appeal. But the argument of the learned

counsel is that, nevertheless, a party can come before this Court against

the Judgment or Order of the High Court of Civil Appeal by way of

revision and/or restitutio in integrum in terms of Article 138 of the

Constitution.

13 | C . A . R I I 0 2 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3

If that argument is accepted, section 5C becomes meaningless, and the

intention of the legislature will blatantly be defeated, as any party

dissatisfied with any Judgment or Order of the High Court of Civil Appeal

can come before this Court by way of revision and/or restitutio in

integrum. Then the party dissatisfied with the Judgment or Order of the

District Court will have three appealsfirst to the High Court of Civil

Appeal, second to the Court of Appeal, and third to the Supreme Court.

That was obviously never the intention of the legislature. One of the main

objectives of setting up High Courts of Civil Appeal is to curb laws delays

in civil litigation and not to expand it.

The question whether the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to sit on

Judgments and Orders made by the High Courts of Civil Appeal was

particularly dealt with by Justice Salam (with Justice Rajapaksha

agreeing) in the Court of Appeal case of Stephan Gunaratne v. Thushara

Indika Sampath [CA (PHC) APN 54/2013 (REV)] decided on 23.09.2013.

That is a case where the plaintiff-petitioner in a partition action came

before this Court by way of revision against the Judgment of the High

Court of Civil Appeal at Ratnapura. Dismissing the application in limine

without issuing notice, Justice Salam stated:

The question that now arises for consideration is whether the Court

of Appeal can exercise its revisionary powers under Article 138 of

the Constitution in respect of a judgment of the High Court

pronounced under the Provisions of Act No 54 of 2006 when the

proper remedy is to appeal to the Supreme Court. Appreciably,

Section 5A of Act No 54 of 2006 quite specifically states that all

relevant written laws applicable to an appeal, in the Court of Appeal

are applicable to the High Court as well. This undoubtedly

demonstrates beyond any iota of doubt that the scheme provided by

14 | C . A . R I I 0 2 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3

Act No 54 of 2006 to facilitate an appeal being heard by the

Provincial High Court is nothing but a clear transfer of jurisdiction

and in effect could be said that as far as appeals are concerned both

the High Court and the Court of Appeal rank equally and are placed

on par with each other. Arising from this statement of law, it must

be understood that if the Court of Appeal cannot act in revision in

respect of a judgment it pronounces in a civil appeal, then it cannot

sit in revision over a judgment entered by the High Court in the

exercise of its civil appellate jurisdiction as well, for both courts are

to be equally ranked when they exercise civil appellate jurisdiction.

..

End of the Quotation.

The following quotation, also from that case is from Justice Priyasath Dep (later

Chief Justice).

Beginning of the Quotation:-

A similar conclusion was reached by the Supreme Court in Balaganeshan

v. OIC, Police Station, Seeduwa (SC SPL/LA No. 79/2015) decided on

01.04.2016 in interpreting similar provisions found in the High Court of

the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990.

That is a criminal case where the accused unsuccessfully appealed to the

Provincial High Court against the Judgment of the Magistrates Court.

Being dissatisfied with the Judgment of the Provincial High Court sitting

in appeal, the accused appealed to the Court of Appeal in terms of section

138 of the Constitution. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal in

limine on the basis of want of jurisdiction. Rejecting leave to appeal against

that dismissal, Justice Dep (as His Lordship then was) with Justice

Wanasundera and Justice Jayawardena agreeing held that:

Continues the quotation,

15 | C . A . R I I 0 2 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3

When the Provincial High Court exercises appellate jurisdiction,

it exercises appellate jurisdiction hitherto exclusively vested in the

Court of Appeal. It exercises a parallel or concurrent jurisdiction

with the Court of Appeal. The High Court when it exercises appellate

jurisdiction it is not subordinate to the Court of Appeal. That is the

basis for conferring jurisdiction on the Supreme Court under section

9 of the High Court of Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of

1990 to hear appeals from the judgments of the High Court when it

exercises appellate jurisdiction. I hold that the Accused Appellant

Petitioner should have filed a Special Leave to Appeal application

against the judgment of the High Court exercising Appellate

Jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in the first instance instead to

the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal correctly upheld the

preliminary objection and rejected the Appeal.

Hence I hold that the Court of Appeal has no appellate jurisdiction to set

aside Judgments or Orders of the High Court of Civil Appeal by way of final

appeal, revision or restitutio in intergrum. That is vested exclusively in the

Supreme Court.

End of the Quotation.

There is also a case Wanasinghe Pedige Sumanawathie vs. Richard Peris Finance

Ltd., C. A. RII 10/22 dated 30.05.2022 in this regard.

That case decided on 30.05.2022 says nothing new, except timorously following

the case of Gammeddage Nilanthi Munasinghe and the case decided by Salam

J.

From the judgment of Salam J., there arises a question which is initially

addressed.

16 | C . A . R I I 0 2 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3

(a) Has section 05A(1) of Act No. 54 of 2006 transferred the civil

appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to the Provincial High

Court?

Salam J., in the above quoted paragraph said,

This undoubtedly demonstrates beyond any iota of doubt that the

scheme provided by Act No 54 of 2006 to facilitate an appeal being heard

by the Provincial High Court is nothing but a clear transfer of

jurisdiction and in effect could be said that as far as appeals are

concerned both the High Court and the Court of Appeal rank equally and

are placed on par with each other.

It is true that his lordship said, that, the two courts rank equally. But, at the

same time it was said, is nothing but a clear transfer of jurisdiction. The word

transfer does not have an exact meaning. It can mean moving something from

one place to another, in which case, it will no longer exist in the firstly said place.

But it can also mean, change (the sense of a word or phrase) by extension or

metaphor, for example, between Latin and English, the sense was transferred

from the inhabitants to the place. Denning L. J., said in Seaford Court Estates

Ld. Vs. Asher [1949] K. B. 481 at page 499 that The English language is not

an instrument of mathematical precision. Our literature would be much the

poorer if it were.

But the other part of the statement that the Provincial High Court and the Court

of Appeal rank equally [as far as civil appellate jurisdiction is concerned] is not

ambiguous.

Section 5A says,

5A. (1) A High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution for

a Province, shall have and exercise appellate and revisionary jurisdiction

in respect of judgments, decrees and orders delivered and made by any

District Court or a Family Court within such Province and the appellate

jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in law, which shall be

committed by any such District Court or Family Court, as the case may

be.

This court considered an argument similar to that of the present 04A and 05th

defendant in Travel Data Tours and Travels (Pvt) Limited vs. Softlogic

Finance PLC, CA No. RII/22/2017 dated 31.05.2022, one day after

Sumanawathies case.

In that case this court considered the case of Sharif And Others Vs.

Wickramasuriya And Others (2010) 1 SLR 255.

In Sharifs case, Eric Basnayake J., in the Court of Appeal considered the

analogous situation in regard to the Provincial High Court created by Article

154P(3) of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

It was said,

Beginning of the Quotation:-

The Constitution

Article 138 of the Constitution gives jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal

with regard to its revisionary powers.

Article 138 is as follows:

138 (1): The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise (subject to the

provisions of the Constitution or of any law) an appellate jurisdiction for

the correction of all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed by

any court of first instance, tribunal or other institution and sole and

exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in

integrum, of all cases, suit, action, prosecutions matters and things of

which such courts of First instance, tribunal or other institution may

have taken cognizance (emphasis added).

The sole jurisdiction given by Article 138 was expanded to High Courts by

Article 154P (3) (b) under the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.

The Article is as follows:

154P (3) Every High Court shall (b) Notwithstanding anything in Article

138 . . . exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of

orders. . . by Magistrate Courts and Primary Courts within the province

In terms of Article 138 the Court of Appeal shall have and exercise. . . sole

and exclusive cognizance by way of appeal; revision. . .

However Article 154(3) (b) has given the High Court appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction in respect of orders by Magistrate Courts and

Primary courts. Hence the Court of Appeal ceased to enjoy sole and

exclusive jurisdiction. Article 154P did not take away the powers exercised

by the Court of Appeal under Article 138.

However section 9 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions)

Act appears to have caused a conflict with regard to the jurisdiction

enjoyed by the Court of Appeal. According to this section an aggrieved

person by a final order of a High Court in the exercise of the appellate

jurisdiction vested in it by paragraph (3) (b) of Article 154P may appeal to

the Supreme Court on a substantial question of law with leave first

obtained from High Court.

Section 9 of High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of

1990 is as follows:

Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other law any person

aggrieved by (a) a final order. . . of a High Court. . . in the exercise of the

appellate jurisdiction vested in it by paragraph (3) (b) of Article 154P. . .

19 | C . A . R I I 0 2 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3

which involves a substantial question of law, may appeal there from to

the Supreme Court if the Court grants leave to appeal to the Supreme

Court. . .

High Court is vested with original jurisdiction and is placed lower to the

Court of Appeal in the order of Courts on superiority. However when a

party chooses to go to High Court with a right of appeal to the Supreme

Court, one may argue that the appellate powers of the Court of Appeal

have been removed.

Has the powers of the Court of Appeal with regard to its appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction been removed? This is not so. Articles 138

and 154P give jurisdiction to Court of Appeal and High Court

respectively to hear appeals and revision from the Magistrate's Court

Against the orders of these courts appeal lie to the Supreme Court

with leave first obtained from the Court of Appeal or the High Court

as the case may be, on a question of law. This does not mean that the

powers enjoyed by the Court of Appeal had been taken away. The

powers of the High Court are limited to the Province. The Court of

Appeal exercises its powers for the whole island.

End of the Quotation.

His Lordship Justice Eric Basnayake then considered the position with regard

to the decentralization of civil appellate jurisdiction. His Lordship said,

Beginning of the Quotation:-

Act No. 54 of 2006

This Act amended Act No. 19 of 1990 with the insertion of sections 5A, 5B,

5C and 5D. Section 5A(1) gives the appellate and the revisionary

jurisdiction which is as follows:

20 | C . A . R I I 0 2 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3

5A (1) A High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution for

a province, shall have and exercise appellate and revisionary jurisdiction

in respect of judgments, decrees and orders delivered and made by anv

District Court or a Family Court within such a province and the

appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in law,

which shall be committed by any such District Court or Family Court,

as the case may be (emphasis added).

(2) Not reproduced

I am of the view that the jurisdiction enjoyed by the Court of Appeal

through Article 138 remains intact. Through Article 138 one has the

liberty to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal or to resort

to a Provincial High Court in terms of Article 154P (3) (b). If one

chooses to go to the High Court, an appeal would lie to the Supreme

Court with leave first obtained from the High Court (Section 9 of the

Act 19 of 1990). If one invokes the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal

under Article 138 an appeal would lie from any final order or

judgement of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court with leave of

Court of Appeal first obtained (Article 128(1) of the Constitution). It

is thus clear that both courts enjoy concurrent jurisdiction on matters

referred to in Article 154P (3) (b). The jurisdiction enjoyed by the Court of

Appeal had not been disturbed by Articles of the Constitution or by the

Acts of Parliament.

Sharvananda C. J., Colin-Thome, Atukorale and Tambiah J. in the case of

In Re the Thirteenth Amendment to The Constitution and The Provincial

Councils Bill (7) at 323 in their determination held as follows:

"The Bill do not effect any change in the structure of the courts

judicial power of the people. The Supreme Court and the Court of

Appeal continued to exercise unimpaired several jurisdictions

vested in them by the Constitution. There is only one Supreme

Court and one Court of Appeal for the whole Island. The 13th

Amendment Bill only seeks to give jurisdictions in respect of. . . Without

prejudice to the executing jurisdictions of the Court of Appeal. Vesting

of this additional jurisdiction in the High Court of each province only

brings justice nearer home to the citizen and reduces delay and cost of

litigation."

End of the Quotation.

Thus, the decentralization, but not the transfer, of appellate powers of the

Court of Appeal in criminal matters (in regard to Magistrates Courts and in the

especial, sui generis jurisdiction of the Primary Courts) and in civil matters (in

regard to the District Courts and Family Courts) by the above legislation has not

affected the hierarchy of courts. The Provincial High Court exercising some

of the appellate powers of the Court of Appeal has not made it another

Court of Appeal; neither had it reduced any such jurisdiction of the Court

of Appeal.

But this was addressed in detail, to make this discussion complete and neither

to say that once a High Court established under section 5A(1) of Act No. 54 of

2006 [commonly, but colloquially called Civil Appellate High Court or High Court

of Civil Appeal] exercises its appellate jurisdiction, either in full, or in part, the

Court of Appeal also can exercise the similar power it has on that matter; and

nor to say, that, once such High Court exercises its appellate power the Court of

Appeal can exercise a superior appellate power on that matter. This is the

objection of the 04A and 05th defendant.

But, appellate power is not the only jurisdiction the Court of Appeal has or

it exercises on a matter. It has the power of revision and the power of

restitutio in integrum. It is the last said jurisdiction which has been

invoked by the plaintiff petitioners in this application.

(b) The jurisdiction of restitutio in integrum:

Mrs. Vivionne Gunawardena vs. Hector Perera, Officer in Charge, Police

Station, Kollupitiya and others S.C. Application 20/1983 was an application

filed in respect of an alleged violation of a fundamental right, where Mrs. Vivionne

Gunawardena alleged, among other things, that she was unlawfully arrested by

the OIC of Kollupiya Police Station. The IGP, the 02nd respondent filed an affidavit

from one Vinayagam Ganeshananthem, Sub Inspector, to the effect that he and

not the 01st respondent who arrested Mrs. Vivionne Gunawardena because she

had no permit to go in a procession. Although Mrs. Vivionne Gunawardane

countered this position, the Supreme Court consisting of a three Judge bench

did not believe her, but believed the affidavit of Vinayagam Ganeshananthem

and decided that the petitioners fundamental rights have been violated as

Vinayagam Ganeshananthem is guilty of unlawfully arresting her.

Vinayagam Ganeshananthem then petitioned to the Supreme Court requesting

to set aside the said decision of the Supreme Court itself, as he was only a

witness (on affidavit) and he was not informed before finding him guilty and

therefore the rule audi alteram partem is violated. This second case was decided

by a Seven Judge bench of the Supreme Court, including the incumbent learned

Chief Justice. The decision was divided 05 to 02 and the majority decided against

Vinayagam Ganeshananthem.

The learned Chief Justice, who wrote the lead judgment of the majority said,

He submits that this caption read with prayer (a) to the petition invokes

a jurisdiction in revision which this Court does not have. One has to look

at the legislation which created this Court to find an answer to this

dispute. That legislation is to be found in the second Republican

Constitution of 1978. The Supreme Court which existed up to the time

of the first Republican Constitution of 1972 and which continued to

exist under that Constitution ceased to exist when the 1978

Constitution became operative. (Vide Article 105 (2) of the Constitution).

Its place was taken by the Court of Appeal (Vide Article 169 (2) of the

1978 Constitution). A new Supreme Court has been constituted which is

the highest and final Superior Court of Record. (Article 118 of the

Constitution).

The relevant portion of Article 169(2) says,

Unless otherwise provided in the Constitution, every reference

in any existing written law to the Supreme Court shall be deemed to

be a reference to the Court of Appeal.

Ranasinghe J., despite being in the minority of the 07 Judge bench judgment

referred to a case decided by Dias S.P.J. in 1950 which was on restitutio in

integrum and said,

The real basis upon which relief is given and the precise nature of

the relief so given by the Supreme Court upon an application made to

it for relief against an earlier Order made by the Supreme Court itself

was very lucidly and very effectively expressed by Dias S.P.J. way

back in the year 1951 in the case of Menchinahamy v. Muniweera,

(40). In that case, about six weeks after an appeal to the Supreme Court

from an interlocutory decree in the District Court was dismissed by the

Supreme Court, an application was made to the Supreme Court, on

23.3.1949, for revision or in the alternative for restitutio-in-integrum by

the heirs of a party defendant, who had died before the interlocutory decree

was entered but whose heirs had not been substituted in his place before

the interlocutory decree was so entered. It was contended on behalf of the

respondents: that there was no merit in the application: that if the relief

sought is granted then the Supreme Court would in effect be sitting

in judgment on a two-Judge decision of the Supreme Court which had

passed the Seal of the Court that the Supreme Court cannot interfere

with the orders of the Supreme Court itself. In rejecting these

24 | C . A . R I I 0 2 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3

objections, Dias S.P.J., placed this matter in its proper setting quite

convincingly in the following words:

"In giving relief to the petitioner we are not sitting in judgment either

on the interlocutory decree or on the decree in appeal passed by this

Court. We are merely declaring that, so far as the petitioner is

concerned, there has been a violation of the principles of

natural justice which makes it incumbent on this Court, despite

technical objections to the contrary, to do justice. "

Ranasinghe J., referring to the judgment of Menchinahamy vs. Muniweera (1950)

52 NLR 409, while being on the minority will not diminish its value. It shows

how the then Supreme Court, exercised the power of restitutio in integrum, even

against a judgment of its own. Today, such a power is vested, hence, not only

under Article 138 of the Constitution, but also on the hierarchical

arrangement of courts and in the mode of exercise of the powers of Courts,

referred to by the learned Chief Justice, in relation to Article 169(2) in the

present Court of Appeal.

Ranasinghe J., further said in the said judgment,

The Supreme Court, as constituted under the 1978 Constitution, is not

vested with the revisionary powers as exercised by the Supreme Court

which was created by the aforesaid Courts Ordinance (Chapter 6).

Despite this view being expressed in a minority judgment in that case, the

judgment of the learned Chief Justice in the majority, drew a similarity between

the present Court of Appeal and the former Supreme Court, to say that the

present Supreme Court does not have revisionary powers. The majority of the

Supreme Court also decided that there is no justification for exercising any of

the inherent powers of the Court in this case.

25 | C . A . R I I 0 2 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3

Thus it appears, that, the Supreme Court newly established under the 1978

Constitution does not have revisionary powers. Under section 37 of the Courts

and their Powers Ordinance of 1889 [Courts Ordinance] the then Supreme Court

was vested with revisionary jurisdiction. The side note to that section said,

Powers in appeal or on revision. The former Supreme Court of Ceylon had not

the jurisdiction of restitutio in integrum vested on it by a statute, but as Dias S.

P. J., exercised it in Menchinahamy va. Muniweera in 1951, it was exercised on

the strength of the Roman Dutch Common law which applies without being

enacted by way of a statute. It is this jurisdiction of restitutio in integrum, which

is presently vested in the Court of Appeal established under the 1978

Constitution by its Article 138.

Dias S.P.J. thus set aside a decree entered pursuant to a judgment given by two

judges of the former Supreme Court (Supreme Court of Ceylon). He did so

accompanied on the Bench with Gunasekera J., who agreed with him. Thus,

even the decree of the same court was set aside exercising the power of restitutio

in integrum.

The jurisdiction of restitutio in integrum is not limited to an alleged breach of

the rule audi alteram partem.

The above discussion also makes it clear, that,

(a) The power of restitutio in integrum, as exercised by Dias S.P.J. in

Menchinahamy vs. Muniweera (1950) in the then Supreme Court is now

vested in the present Court of Appeal,

(b) The power of revision is also vested with the present Court of Appeal,

(c) The present Supreme Court has, with respect, exercised its inherent

powers very rarely (vide., the 07 Judge bench judgment referred to)

Thus this Court is not precluded from exercising its power of restitutio in

integrum even if a High Court exercising civil appellate jurisdiction has given a

judgment.

26 | C . A . R I I 0 2 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3

It may be noted, that, section 48(4)(a)(iv) and (d) says,

(a) Whenever a party to a partition action- (iv) being a party who

has duly filed his statement of claim and registered his address, fails

to appeal at the trial,

Under section 48(4)(a)(iv) and (d) when special leave is granted, the district court

has the power to settle questions of fact and law arising from the pleadings and

any further pleadings which are relevant to the claim set up in the petition

only.

Hence, what the Court can consider is only the Statement of Claims of that party,

or averments in any further pleading which is relevant to the claim set up in the

petition only. Hence the scope of further pleadings, if any, is confined to the four

corners of the petition. In the petition dated 03.11.1997 the 04th defendant

pleaded no deed but only prescriptive title.

As per the Statement of Claims of the 04th defendant, which was referred to at

the commencement of this judgment, only deed No. 2018 dated 17th May 1994

is pleaded.

The said deed is at page 714 of the Original case record. The first vendor is

Mallika Arachchige Percy Perera. He claimed title by virtue of parental

inheritance and upon a deed of declaration. He did not specify as to parental

inheritance from whom. The second vendor is Kuruppu Arachchige Dona

Rupawathie. She claimed title from prescriptive possession.

The Interlocutory Decree dated 24th February 1997, which could not be set aside

by the learned district judge but only could be altered or modified under section

48(4)(d) gave Rupawathie an undivided 13/84 shares, which is therefore

conveyed to the 04th defendant the only right accruable. Hence there requires

no change in the Interlocutory Decree.

27 | C . A . R I I 0 2 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3

Except as provided under subsection (4) aforesaid, under subsection (1) the

words, notwithstanding any omission or defect of procedure or in the proof

of title adduced before the court or the fact that all persons concerned are

not parties to the partition action; applies. As the procedure followed by

the district court on and after 18.11.1998 is not sanctioned by subsection (4) the

aforesaid part in subsection (1) applies and therefore the Interlocutory Decree

entered on 24.02.1997 is valid in law.

Hence exercising the power of Restitutio in Integrum this Court sets aside the

judgment of the High Court which exercised civil appellate jurisdiction as well as

the judgment given by the district court after its initial judgment and this Court

restores the judgment dated 24th February 1997 delivered by Hon. Dammika

Kitulgoda, District Judge and the Interlocutory Decree entered accordingly.

The learned district judge will enter Final Decree accordingly after executing the

final scheme of partition.

The plaintiffs are entitled to claim cost of this application from the 04A and 05th

defendants and the 09th defendant.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
