Judgment

Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree Lyrics

Im coming home ive done my time

Now Ive got to know what is and isnt mine

If you received my letter telling you Id soon be free

Then youll know just what to do, if you still want me

According to the song, the singer has asked his wife to tie a Yellow ribbon round

the ole Oak tree, if she still wants him. When the bus comes to the Oak tree, he

sees A hundred yellow ribbons round the ole oak tree!

According to the plaintiff petitioner in this case, when he came home after serving

a jail term of 19 years in Thailand, from 1997 to 2016, he saw his wife, the 1st

defendant having married another person and given birth to a child and that the

house has been leased to the 2nd and 3rd defendants.

He instituted case No. RE 212/2016 to eject defendants. The 1st defendant said

that she has contributed one half to build the house. The 2nd defendant wanted

him to be discharged from proceedings. The 3rd defendant took up the position

that he is in occupation under a lease agreement.

The third date of trial was for 01st November 2017. The trial was at Moratuwa.

The plaintiff was coming from Balapitiya. He was not there in Court when the

case was called. But his Counsel appeared.

This is how the 1st defendant respondent described what happened in her written

submissions before this Court,

7. Thereafter when the case was taken up for trial on 01.11.2017,

the counsel for the petitioner had been present in Court but the

petitioner has been absent and the learned counsel has informed

the trial Court that plaintiff was absent and he is unable to inform

as to the reason for his absence and also had informed Court that

as his instructing Attorney at Law was on Maternity leave he could

not obtain instructions from the said instructing Attorney at Law

and hence had further informed the trial Court that in any event he

is only ready to frame issues in the case and moved for a

postponement of the trial on the said grounds.

The defendants objected and the learned District Judge dismissed plaintiffs

action. The plaintiff petitioner asks for the setting aside of that order by the

present application.

It is also stated in the above written submissions of the 1st defendant respondent,

15. It is very respectfully submitted that on perusal of the proceedings

dated 01.11.2017, it will be observed that on the said date of trial, the

plaintiff was absent but an Attorney at Law had appeared in the case.

16. Under the said circumstances, it is pertinent to arrive at a conclusion

as to whether there was a proper representation on behalf of the plaintiff

on the said date before the trial Court and the said fact plays a very vital

role in the instant case.

The plaintiff petitioner cites the following case,

Andiappa Chettiar vs. Sanmugam Chettiar 33 NLR 218,

Divisional Bench, Macdonell C. J.,

4 | C . A . R I I 1 0 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 0 5 . 0 7 . 2 0 2 3

the presence in Court, when a case is called, of the Proctor on record

constitutes an appearance for the party from whom the Proctor holds the

proxy, unless the Proctor expressly inform Court that he does not, on that

occasion, appear for the party.

Hence, when a lawyer appears, unless he says that (1) he has no instructions

and (2) he does not appear it constitutes an appearance and the party is not at

default which could not be dismissed under section 87(1) of the Civil Procedure

Code.

However, in the above case, it was the Proctor of record who appeared. In the

present case, it was the Counsel. Would that make a difference?

The Registered Attorney at Law was on Maternity leave. That does not make her

proxy invalid because it is only a temporary inability to appear. The fact that

Counsel has appeared signifies that he had instructions given earlier to appear,

for otherwise he would not have appeared. His inability to proceed with the trial

was, because, a trial usually needs the calling of witnesses and neither the

plaintiff, nor any of his witnesses were present. But his indicating that he can

record admissions and issues means that he had instructions (notwithstanding

his saying that he could not get instructions from the Registered Attorney at Law

on Maternity leave) to appear. Hence, it was an appearance and the action

could not have been dismissed under section 87(1) which says,

87(1) Where the plaintiff or where both the plaintiff and the defendant

make default in appearing on the day fixed for the trial, the court shall

dismiss the plaintiffs action.

Furthermore, since there was an appearance the dismissal was inter partes.

Gamini Amarathunga J., held that,

When an action is dismissed in the presence of a partys lawyer after

refusing an application for a postponement it is not an order made for

default. The order dismissing the action had been made inter partes. Such

5 | C . A . R I I 1 0 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 0 5 . 0 7 . 2 0 2 3

an order cannot be set aside under section 87(3). The remedy of the

plaintiff is a final appeal.Don Gamini Abeysundara vs. Malalage

Gunapala, C. A. No. 676/2001, C. A. minutes dated 19.01.2004.

Therefore, the petitioner could not have made an application under Chapter XII

section 87(3).

Hence what is said in 1st defendant respondents written submissions at

paragraph 21 cannot be accepted.

21. It is further submitted that in view of the above submissions, the

plaintiff ought to have proceeded with his application to vacate the order

of the learned trial judge dated 01.11.2017 under the provisions of Chapter

XII of the Civil Procedure Code instead of preferring the instant application

to Your Lordships Court as there is an alternative remedy available to

him.

The remedy under section 87(3) was not available. What was available was a final

appeal. The plaintiff has not appealed. But a revision is an available remedy.

According to the caption the plaintiff petitioner moves this Court under revision

and restitutio in integrum.

The 1st defendant respondent further submits,

10. On perusal of the journal entries in the case, it will be observed that

on 21.02.2018, the plaintiff had preferred an application under the

provisions of Chapter XII of the Civil Procedure Code read with section 839

seeking to set aside and or to vacate the order dated 01.11.2017

dismissing the case of the plaintiff and fixing the case for ex parte trial on

the claim in reconvention of the 1st defendant.

The above judgment shows that there cannot be an application under Chapter

XII, in respect of default, as there was no default. Although there could be an

application under section 839 on inherent powers, it is no bar for an application

for revision and restitutio in integrum.

Hence the following submission for the 1st defendant respondent cannot be

accepted,

25. Therefore, it is very respectfully submitted that the instant

application in Restitutio in integrum is made premature and for the

reasons adduced in the preceding paragraphs of this written submission,

the plaintiff is guilty of laches and has preferred the instant application

without any merit whatsoever.

Plaintiff cannot be guilty of laches and making the application premature at the

same time. What is referred to as laches, according to the said written

submissions, is preferring the application under section 839 after three months.

In the circumstances, it is not lashes. As reasons given above would show, this

application is not premature.

If there is any requirement of an exceptional circumstance, the order of

dismissal of the learned district judge is such. She did not have to dismiss the

action since the Counsel was ready to record admissions and issues. Her fixing

the case ex parte on the claim in reconvention of the 1st defendant respondent

was also wrong, because it was inter partes.

In revision and restitutio in integrum the objective is correction of errors. In

Marian Beebee vs. Seyed Mohamed and others 69 C. L. W. 34 at 36 (also 68

NLR 36 at 38) which is a decision of five Judges, Chief Justice Melanie Claud

Sansoni said,

The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite

independent of and distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of this Court.

Its object is the due administration of justice and the correction of errors,

sometimes committed by this court itself, in order to avoid miscarriage

of justice. It is exercised in some cases by a Judge of his own

motion,

7 | C . A . R I I 1 0 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 0 5 . 0 7 . 2 0 2 3

Although this case is no non appearance since it has been dealt with so, what

was said by Dr. A. R. B. Amerasinghe J., in the Supreme Court in Jinadasa and

another vs. Sam Silva and others 1994 (1) SLR 232, which is a case which has

referred to 153 cases will also apply,

5. Where a party has established that he had acted bona fide and done

his best, but was prevented by some emergency, which could not have

been anticipated or avoided with reasonable diligence from being present

at the hearing, his absence may be excused and the matter restored. The

Court cannot prevent miscarriages of justice except within the framework

of the law: it cannot order the reinstatement of an application it had

dismissed, unless sufficient cause for absence is alleged and established.

It cannot order reinstatement on compassionate grounds. Inasmuch as it

is a serious thing to deny a party his right of hearing, a court may, in

evaluating the established facts, be more inclined to generosity rather

than being severe, rigorous and unsparing.

Therefore, in exercising the powers of revision and restitutio in integrum in this

Court, the order of the learned district judge dated 01.11.2017 is set aside and

the plaintiff petitioners case is restored back to the roll of calling cases.

The learned district judge is directed to go on with the action according to law.

The application is allowed. There is no order on costs.
