JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) and 2nd

and 3rd accused were indicted for causing the death of Olupathage

Jayasena Silva, an offence punishable in terms of Section 296 read with

Section 32 of the Penal Code.

After a non-jury trial, the Learned High Court Judge has found the

Appellant guilty in terms of Section 296 of Penal Code and sentenced him

to death on 14/07/2014.

During the pendency of the trial the 3rd accused had passed away and the

indictment was amended accordingly. The prosecution had called 07

witnesses and closed their case. Before the defence was called, Learned

Counsel who appeared for the 2nd accused made an application under

200(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 and the

Learned High Court Judge accepting submission made by the defence

3 | P a g e

Counsel acquitted the 2nd accused from this case. Hence, the full trial

continued only against the Appellant and at the conclusion of the trial, the

Learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellant for committing the

murder of the deceased Olupathage Jayasena Silva and sentenced him to

death.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that

the Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to

the Covid 19 pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellant was

connected via Zoom from prison.

At the very outset, Learned Presidents Counsel appearing on behalf of the

Appellant had submitted to this court that he will be making submissions

only with regards to the conviction as the conviction under Section 296 of

the Penal Code cannot stand, whereas it should have been considered

under Section 297 of Penal Code on the basis of a sudden fight.

The evidence presented by the prosecution and the defence jointly revealed

that the deceased had attacked the sister of PW1 and PW2 in the morning

of the date of the incident. Due to the said attack the sister of PW1 and

PW2 had suffered an injury. This had prompted parties to involve in a

sudden fight.

The Learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that the consideration

of lesser culpability would not arise as the defence in this case has not

accepted responsibility in any manner whatsoever for the injuries inflicted

on the deceased. This position was not accepted by the Learned High Court

Judge who heard the case. But he accepted the defence version and come

to the conclusion of existing of a fight in his judgment. The said portion is

re-produce below:

According to the doctor who held the post mortem stated that the death of

the deceased had been occasioned due to haemorrhage due to a stab injury

to the chest.

As there was a fight erupted between the parties over this incident which

had been endorsed by the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment, the

Learned Presidents Counsel made his application under Exception 4 to

Section 294 of the Penal Code.

The above-mentioned 4th Exception provides as follows:

Culpable homicide is not murder it is committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden

quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or

acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

Explanation: - It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the

provocation or commits the first assault.

In the event where the defence of sudden fight has not been taken up on

behalf of the Appellant, and also the injury alleged to have been inflicted on

5 | P a g e

the Appellant, the Learned High Court Judge should have considered the

evidence which favours the Appellant more meticulously.

In The King v Bellana Vitanage Eddin 41 NLR 345 the court held that:

"In a charge of murder, it is the duty of the judge to put to the jury the

alternative of finding the accused guilty of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder when there is any basis for such a finding in the

evidence on record, although such defence was not raised nor relied

upon by the accused.

In Luvis v. The Queen 56 NLR 442 the court held that:

Having regard to the evidence, the fact that sudden fight was not

specifically raised as a defence did not relieve the trial judge of the

duty of placing before the jury that aspect of the case.

In this case although Learned High Court Judge had come to the

conclusion that the incident had taken place due to a sudden fight, but not

awarded the benefit to the Appellant under exception 4 of the Section 294

of the Penal Code. This is a clear misdirection which certainly vitiate the

conviction for murder. The failure by the Learned High Court Judge to

consider diminishing responsibility as required by the law has caused great

prejudice to the Appellant.

Considering all the circumstances stressed before this court I conclude that

this is an appropriate case to consider for the Appellants benefit, his

entitlement for a plea of sudden fight under Exception-4 to Section 294 of

the Penal Code.

6 | P a g e

Hence, I set aside the death sentence and convict the Appellant for culpable

homicide not amounting to murder under Section 297 of the Penal Code. I

sentence the Appellant for 10 years rigorous imprisonment commencing

from the date of conviction namely 14/07/2020, which was his previous

date of conviction and sentence for the charge of murder.

Subject to the above variation the appeal is partly allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to

High Court of Kalutara along with the original case record.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

I agree.
