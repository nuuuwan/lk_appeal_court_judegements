MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeal has been lodged to set aside the judgement dated

11.11.2020 of the High Court of Vavuniya. The appellant had been indicted for

committing rape on an underage girl.

The appellant had pleaded not guilty and upon the conclusion of the trial the

trial judge had convicted the appellant for both charges.

When the matter was taken up for argument the Counsel appearing for the

appellant submitted that he is only canvassing the sentence imposed by the trial

judge. The learned Counsel for the respondents did not object to the application

but both parties made their submissions.

The Counsel for the appellant referred to case no 241-2020 and said that the

appellant had been indicted for the same offence more than once. But the

learned Counsel for the respondents submitted that the offences set out had

been taking place repetitively and as such the charges have been framed so, but

he also drew the attention of Court that although the appellant has pleaded that

there was a love affair between the two that the appellant is twice the age of

the victim.

Having considered the submissions of both parties the trial judge had sentenced

the appellant for 10 years rigorous imprisonment, with a fine of Rs 3000/ in

default 01 month simple imprisonment.

This Court observes that the learned trial judge had imposed the minimum

sentence for the charge but taking in to account the legal principle laid down in

the case of Maramba Liyanage Rohana alias Loku vs AG SC Appeal No 89A-2009

decided on 12.5.2011 by Amaratunga J it has been held with regard to the

minimum sentence being stipulated by the legislature for the offence the

appellant has been sentenced 10 years RI that

In terms of Section 363 of the Penal Code, as amended by Penal Code

(Amendment) Act No.22 of 1995 sexual intercourse with a woman under sixteen

years of age is rape irrespective of the consent of the women.

Accordingly, the learned trial Judge, by his judgement dated 31.10.2006 quite

rightly held that the accused was guilty of the offence punishable under Section

364 (2) (e) of the Penal Code and sentenced him to ten years rigorous

imprisonment, the mandatory minimum period of imprisonment prescribed by

law, and a fine of Rs.2500/- with a default term of imprisonment for one year.

There was no finding on the charge of abduction.

The accused appealed to the Court of Appeal against the conviction and

sentence. Whilst this appeal was pending a Judge of the High Court in the course

of the proceeding in a case where the accused in that case was charged under

section 364 (2) (e) of the Penal Code, (identical offence with which the accused

Page 4 of 5

was charged) submitted a reference to this Court in terms of Article 125 (1) of

the Constitution. In that reference the learned High Court Judge has posed the

question whether Section 364 (2) of the Penal Code as amended by Penal Code

(amendment) Act No.22 of 1995 has removed the judicial discretion when

sentencing an accused convicted for an offence punishable under section 364 (2)

(e) of the Penal Code.

This reference was taken up for determination before a Bench of three Judges of

this Court on 29.07.2008 with notice to the Attorney General and after

considering the submissions of the learned Senior State Counsel who appeared

as amicus curiae on behalf of the Attorney General, this Court pronounced its

determination on 15.8.2008 on the question submitted to it. SC Reference

3/2008,H.C. Anuradhapura Case No.333/2004, SCM 15.10.2008, (reported in

2008 BLR in Part II The Bar Association Law Journal (2008) vol. XIV, page 160).

The unanimous opinion of the Court in that determination was that the

minimum mandatory sentence in Section 362 (2) (e) Is in conflict with Article 4

(c), 11 and 12 (1) of the Constitution and that the High Court is not inhibited

from imposing a sentence that it deems appropriate in the exercise of its judicial

discretion notwithstanding the minimum mandatory sentence.

This determination removed the knot of mandatory sentence which up to that

time tied hands pf the trial Judges with regard to the appropriate sentence to

be imposed in the circumstances of the particular case tried by them.

Furthermore, it would be an erosion of the inherent judicial discretion with

regard to sentencing. This was also followed in the case of SC Appeal 890-2009

decided on 12.5.2011 decided and also in SC Appeal 17-20013 decided on

12.3.20015.

Hence taking in to consideration the legal principles decided above this Court

is of the view that in the instant matter the sentence should be varied to 7

years RI and rest of the sentence to remain the same but it is to be operative

from the date of the conviction.

Subject to the above variation the instant appeal is hereby dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
