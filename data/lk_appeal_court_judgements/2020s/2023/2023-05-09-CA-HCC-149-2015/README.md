********************

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Accused (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was found guilty

in the High Court of Gampaha of murder and punished with death under Section 296 of

the Penal Code. This an appeal preferred by the said Accused impugning the conviction.

The Accused, along with the 2nd Accused, was indicted before the High Court of

Gampaha on two counts; the second, for which he was found guilty, was for committing

the murder of one Hasitha Kelum Madawala, which is an offence punishable under

Section 296 of the Penal Code read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

Both, the Accused and the 2nd Accused opted for trial by a judge. The Prosecution

led the evidence of twenty-one witnesses and drew its case to a close. The Accused gave a

dock statement. Two witnesses gave evidence for the Defence.

At the conclusion of the trial the learned Trial Judge convicted the Accused and

sentenced him to death for count two (vide judgment and sentence dated 14th August 2015,

respectively on pages 1006 and 1079 of the Brief). The 2nd Accused was convicted for the

first count (that the Accused and himself conspired to commit the murder of the said

Hasitha Kelum Madawala, liable to be punished under Sections 113B, 102, 32 read with

Section 296 of the Penal Code) and punished with five years rigorous imprisonment and

a fine of Rs. 25,000/- with a default term of one-year simple imprisonment. Being

aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Accused preferred the instant

appeal. In passing it must be observed that the sentence passed upon the 2nd Accused is

erroneous in law, and it is evidently so on the face of the record. However, since neither

the Attorney General nor the 2nd Accused appealed that conviction and sentence it would

be unfair to the 2nd Accused for us to delve into this matter.

Page 3 of 13

The factual background, in brief, as deduced from the evidence is as follows. On or

around the 5th of January 2013, the 1st Accused met at a pub/restaurant with Anura

Abeygunawardena (PW7) and one Nalin Kumara. Having received a call, purporting to

be from the son of the Accused, the Accused had agitatedly sought to leave the

pub/restaurant at around 7 pm. Meanwhile, at around 7 30pm two persons donning full-

face helmets arrived on a black motorcycle and fired shots within close range at the

deceased victim, whilst the deceased victim was leaning against his car along a road in

the vicinity of his residence, which was situated around 15 minutes away from the

pub/restaurant at which the Accused was that evening. There were three wounds on the

body of the deceased victim that was observed by the Judicial Medical Officer (PW22) to

be caused by gunshots.

At first glance, the aforesaid narration of events seems to run parallelly and there

does not appear to be any connection between the Accused who was at a pub drinking and

then left the same, and the deceased who was shot by two persons on a motorbike.

However, as with most cases of circumstantial evidence in which the pieces of the puzzle

must be fitted together, in the present matter, as morefully discussed below, the

confessions made to certain witnesses, the subsequent conduct of the Accused, and finally

the absence of any explanation to save ones self from the incriminating facts makes it

apparent that the case against the Accused has been proved sufficient enough to satisfy

the standard of proof in a criminal trial.

The learned Counsel for the Accused agitated before this Court that the learned

Trial Judge had erred in law, especially in her failure to appreciate the facts of the case

correctly; including the wrongful reliance on the evidence of accomplices, which in the

absence of corroboration of material particulars becomes dangerous to rely on.

Evidence of an accomplice

It is the contention of the Accused that the evidence of the PW1 and PW2 must be

treated as evidence of Accomplices and therefore independently corroborated.

The learned Trial Judge has sought to treat the evidence of PW1 and PW2, who

were arrested for this murder, as evidence of accomplices. They turned State witnesses

following conditional pardons granted by the State. The learned Trial Judge observed that

Page 4 of 13

she had no difficulty in accepting their evidence; that the statements made by the Accused

to PW2 over the phone would constitute a confession in terms of the law.

An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person, and a

conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of

an accomplice (vide Section 133 of the Evidence Ordinance). Section 114(b) provides the

Court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit unless the accomplice is

corroborated in material particulars.

The Indian Supreme Court in Haroom Haji Abdulla v. State of Maharashtra [1968]

AIR 832 analysing Sections 133 and 114(b) of the Indian Evidence Ordinance which

contains provisions similar to that of Sri Lanka lucidly explained how these two statutory

provisions maybe reconciled:

The law as to accomplice evidence is settled. The Evidence Act in s. 133 provides that an

accomplice is a competent witness against an accused person and that a conviction is not illegal

merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. The effect of this

provision is that the court trying an accused may legally convict him on the single evidence, of an

accomplice. To this there is a rider in illustration (b) to s. 114 of the Act which provides that the

Court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit unless he is corroborated in material

particulars. This cautionary provision incorporates a rule of prudence because an accomplice, who

betrays his associates, is not a fair witness and it is possible that he may, to please the prosecution,

weave false details into those which are true and his whole story appearing true, there may be no

means at hand to sever the false from that which is true. It is for this reason that courts, before

they act on accomplice evidence, insist on corroboration in material respects as to the offence itself

and also implicating in some satisfactory way, however small, each accused named by the

accomplice. In this way the commission of the offence is confirmed by some competent evidence

other than the single or unconfirmed testimony of the accomplice and the inclusion by the

accomplice of an innocent person is defeated. This rule of caution or prudence has become so

ingrained in the consideration of accomplice evidence as to have almost the standing of a rule of

law. [emphasis added]

Recently, the Indian Supreme Court in Somasundaram v. the State (Criminal

Appeal No. 403 of 2010 decided on 03.06.2020), referring to this judgment, provided a

useful summary of the Indian stance on the evidence of an accomplice (at para 65):

Page 5 of 13

The combined result of Sections 133 read with illustration (b) to Section 114 of Evidence

Act is that the Courts have evolved, as a rule of prudence, the requirement that it would be unsafe

to convict an accused solely based on uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. The corroboration

must be in relation to the material particulars of the testimony of an accomplice. It is clear that an

accomplice would be familiar with the general outline of the crime as he would be one who has

participated in the same and therefore, indeed, be familiar with the matter in general terms. The

connecting link between a particular accused and the crime, is where corroboration of the

testimony of an accomplice would assume crucial significance. The evidence of an accomplice must

point to the involvement of a particular accused. It would, no doubt, be sufficient, if his testimony

in conjunction with other relevant evidence unmistakably makes out the case for convicting an

accused.

Our law on evaluating the evidence of an accomplice, stemming from a similar

cautionary approach, is similar to the Indian line of thinking, as illustrated in the

following line of authorities. This cautionary approach can be traced back to the wisdom

of the English judgment of Rex v. Baskerville [1916] 2 K.B. 658.

In Ilangatilaka v. Republic of Sri Lanka [1984] 2 SLR 38 at 42 his Lordship Colin-

Thome J. held:

There is no doubt that the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is admissible in law:

See R v. Atwood and Robbins. But it has long been a rule of practice at common law for a judge to

warn a jury that it is extremely dangerous to convict a prisoner on the uncorroborated testimony

of an accomplice or accomplices, and, in the discretion of the judge, to advise them not to convict

upon such evidence ; the judge should point out to the jury that it is within their legal province to

convict upon such unconfirmed evidence : Reg. v. Stubbs (2), in re Meunier (3). This rule of practice

has become virtually equivalent to a rule of law.

The rule of practice as to corroborative evidence has arisen in consequence of the danger

of convicting a person upon the unconfirmed testimony of one who is admittedly a criminal who

has cast his erstwhile associates and friends to the wolves in order to save his own skin. What is

required is some additional evidence rendering it probable that the story of the accomplice is true

and that it is reasonably safe to act upon it. [emphasis added]

Their Lordships of the Supreme Court in Sudu Aiya v. the Attorney General [2005]

1 SLR 358 also citing the well-known judgment of Rex v. Baskerville (supra) observed (at

p. 371):

The important consideration when looking for corroboration is that, the complete story need not

be corroborated, but what the law requires is corroboration in some material particulars so that a

Page 6 of 13

court could act on that evidence as being reliable. In other words what is necessary is some

additional evidence direct or circumstantial, rendering it probable that the accomplices story is

true and reasonably safe to act upon, and such evidence has the effect of connecting or tending to

connect the particular accused with the crime. [emphasis added]

However, for this principle to be applicable it is imperative that the witness must

first be identified as an accomplice. Who an accomplice is has been the subject of

discussion in the following line of cases:

Their Lordships of the Supreme Court in De Saram v. Republic of Sri Lanka [2002]

1 SLR 288 cited with approval the definition of an accomplice set out in Wharton on

Criminal Evidence. An accomplice is thus:

a person who knowingly, voluntarily and with common intent with the principal offender

unites in the commission of a crime. The term cannot be used in a loose or popular sense so as to

embrace one who has guilty knowledge or is morally delinquent or who was an admitted

participant in a related but distinct offence. To constitute one an accomplice, he must perform some

act or take some part in the commission of the crime, or owe some duty to the person in danger

that makes it incumbent on him to prevent its commission. [emphasis added]

In W.M.M. Kumarihami v. Galagamage Indrawansa Kumarasir & Others SC TAB

Appeal No. 02/2012 SC Minutes 02.04.2014 her Ladyship Shiranee Thilakawardane J.

cited the definition given in Chetumal Rekumal v. Emperor [1934] AIR 183,

An accomplice is one who is a guilty associate in crime or who sustains such relation to the

criminal act that he could be charged jointly with the accused. It is admittedly, not every

participation in a crime which makes a party an accomplice in it so as to require his testimony to

be confirmed.

Her Ladyship further observed:

Thus, the idea that all acts pertaining to a crime can make a party an accomplice is ill-

founded.

A person merely assisting in the disposal of the body of the deceased in respect of

whom a charge of murder is made cannot be considered an accomplice within the meaning

of Section 114(b) of the Evidence Ordinance. Buttressing this proposition are the cases of

King v. Peiris Appuhamy 43 NLR 412 and Queen v. Ariyawathie 59 NLR 241.

Page 7 of 13

An observation of his Lordship Soza J. in Attorney General v. D. Seneviratne

[1982] 1 SLR 302 at p. 328 is pertinent to the facts of the instant case:

Glanville Williams in his Textbook of Criminal Law (1978) p. 285 defines accomplices as

parties in different degree of complicity to a crime and adds Accomplices consist of the perpetrator

and the accessories. This indeed is the primary and natural meaning of the term. The perpetrator

is the person who in law commits the offence. A person who incites or helps the commission of an

offence by the perpetrator is an accessory. But help given after the commission of the crime does

not make the helper an accomplice.

While a co-perpetrator and an accessory before the fact clearly, are accomplices, an

accessory after the fact is not necessarily always so. The principal danger in the evidence of an

accomplice is that he; may be tempted to purchase immunity by currying favour with; the

prosecution and implicating another while reducing his own role in the offence. But no such danger

exists in the case of. an accessory, after the fact. Indeed the interest of an accessory after the fact

should be to establish the innocence of the principal offender not his guilt.

In the facts of the present case, the role played by PW1 and PW2 cannot be treated

as that of an accomplice for the reason that, their role was, if at all, to assist the Accused

to disappear following the murder. There is no evidence to establish that they had

knowledge of the Accuseds plans to commit this heinous crime. As such, we are of the

view that they are not accomplices within the meaning of the law. Consequently, there

does not appear to be a need for corroboration in material particulars as required by the

wisdom of Section 114(b) of the Evidence Ordinance or that of the common law.

Confession

Even if it is assumed, although it cannot be so, for the sake of argument, that PW2

is an accomplice, his evidence is sufficiently corroborated by other witnesses. For instance,

let us examine the matter of the confession.

Prior to examining the same, it is pertinent to set out the test to determine whether

a statement is a confession.

Section 17(2) of the Evidence Ordinance provides that,

A confession is an admission made at any time by a person accused of an offence stating or

suggesting the inference that he committed that offence.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his tome, Law of Evidence (Volume 1 p. 378) explains

that this definition suggests four elements. Those are:

Page 8 of 13

a)must be an admission, that is, a statement, oral or documentary, which suggests an

inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact within the meaning of Section 17(1) of the

ordinance:

b) It may be made at any time;

c) It must be made by a person accused of an offence;

d)It must state or suggest the inference that he committed the offence.

This definition tallies substantially with Stephen's definition of a confession as an

admission made at any time by a person charged with a crime stating or suggesting the inference,

that he committed that crime.

In the notable judgment of Anandagoda v. the Queen 64 NLR 73 at 79 the Privy

Council laid down the test to determine whether a statement is a confession. The relevant

excerpt of the judgment reads:

The test whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, whether to the mind of a

reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstance in which it was made

it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or which suggested

the inference that he committed the offence. The statement must be looked at as a whole and it

must be considered on its own terms without reference to extrinsic facts

The appropriate test in deciding whether a particular statement is a confession is whether

the words of admission in the context expressly or substantially admit guilt or do they taken

together in the context inferentially admit guilt? A useful definition of a confession is to be found

in Wigmores Law of Evidence. Section 821 page 930 quoting from a judgment of Wolverton J. in

State v Porter 32 Or. 135, 49 Pac. 964 : We take it that the admission of a fact, or of a bundle of

facts, from which guilt is directly deducible, or which within and of themselves import guilt, may

be denominated a confession, but not so 'with the admission of a particular act or acts or

circumstances which may or may not involve guilt, and which is dependent for such result upon

other facts or circumstances to be established. It is not necessary that there be a declaration of an

intent to admit guilt; it is sufficient that the facts admitted involve a crime, and these import guilt,

or, as put by Mr. Wharton, I am guilty of this ; and this imports the admission of all the acts

constituting guilt . It is necessary, however, that the accused should speak with, an animus

confitendi, or an intention to speak the truth touching the specific charge of guilt; and when he,

with such intention, narrates facts -constituting a crime, the guilt becomes matter of inference, a

resultant feature of the narration without an explicit declaration to that effect. So that we conclude

Page 9 of 13

that whenever the statements or declarations of the accused, voluntarily made, are of such facts

as involve necessarily the admission of a crime, or in themselves constitute a crime, then the facts

admitted import guilt, and such admissions may properly be denominated confessions.

[emphasis added]

In the present case, in the evidence of PW2, he notes that on the night of the

murder, the Accused had telephoned him and asked whether he can visit PW2, who was

at home. At home, the Accused had told PW2 (page 340 of the Brief),

which initially led PW2 to believe that the Accused assaulted or attacked the deceased.

However, subsequently, it became apparent that the statement meant something more

than fisticuffs. This is apparent in the evidence of PW2 (pages 345-348 Brief proceedings

dated 27.11.2014):

The evidence of PW2 is further buttressed by the evidence of PW7. In the evidence

of PW7, it is revealed that the same words amounting to a confession were uttered to PW7,

who is an independent witness, with whom the Accused had been at a pub prior to the

incident. The Accused had telephoned PW7 after the incident took place. The evidence of

PW7 notes that the Accused had told him; (page 301,302

proceedings dated 21.11.2014). Although admittedly, PW7 was drunk at the time when

Page 11 of 13

the Accused had called him, his evidence remained unshaken in cross-examination. There

was no denial that the Accused had called. Further, there were no suggestions to the effect

that it was not the Accused who spoke to him, or that he was lying.

We are of the view that the statements uttered by the Accused to two different

witnesses are of a confessionary nature.

Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer in Nandhini Satpathy v. P.L.Dani (1978) 2SCC 424

notably remarked Confession is a potency to make crime conclusive. A statement

recently referred to in the judgment of his Lordship Priyantha Fernando J. in Artygala

Vithanage Indika Ruwan Kumara v. the Attorney General CA- HCC188/2016 CA Minutes

23.09.2019.

We are mindful of a school of thought that a sense of caution must be exercised in

dealing with extra-judicial confessions. However, as mentioned above, the statements of

a confessionary nature, in the instant case, are only one piece of a puzzle, which must be

read in conjunction with all the facts pointing in the direction of the Accused. It is not the

sole basis for conviction. Further, the defence has not been able to impeach the veracity

of the statements made by the Accused to the two witnesses. It must also be noted that

the statements appear to be voluntary and of his free will.

Subsequent Conduct

Section 8 of the Evidence Ordinance makes subsequent conduct of a party, an

offence against whom is the subject of the proceeding, relevant if it influences or is

influenced by any fact in issue or relevant fact. As the learned author Coomaraswamy

notes (at p. 233) there must be a departure with intent to defeat or delay the arrest. It is

to go out of the jurisdiction of the court or to conceal oneself to avoid legal process.

In the instant case, it cannot be said that the conduct of the Accused is mere

absconding, similar to that of the tendency of an innocent person to evade arrest when

suspected of grave crimes; an instinct of self-preservation in an average human being

(Woodroffe and Ameer Ali in Law of Evidence p. 815). The learned authors citing the

cases of Mureed v State of Rajasthan (1980) 5 Raj Cr C 387, p. 391 and Rameshwar v.

State of Rajasthan (1980) Raj Cr C 127, observe (at p. 817):

Page 12 of 13

It is no doubt true that per se absconding is not enough to prove the guilt of the person

who has absconded. But it comes in as an important piece of corroborative evidence, if there is

other evidence to prove the connection of the accused with the crime. In this case, the accused ran

away to Pakistan after the commission of the murder and came back from there after 40 days. The

accused gave no plausible explanation for his absence. The motive on the part of the accused to

commit the murder of the deceased was established. The absconding of the accused for such a long

period was taken into consideration by the court and the accused was convicted on charge of

murder under s302, IPC 1860.

The fact that he was immediately taken to a relatives place in Negombo, foreign

currency provided, and a ticket purchased to leave for Singapore, and arrested at the

airport (at around 1.30 am on the 8th of January 2013), all culminates in the inescapable

conclusion that he absconded with an intent to defeat or delay the arrest. The learned

High Court Judge has correctly analysed that evidence.

Defendant has not sought to controvert the incriminating evidence

In Phillipu Mandige Nalaka Chrishantha Kumara Thisera v. Attorney General

C.A. Appeal 87/2005 C.A. Minutes 17.05.07 it was stated that when the evidence has not

been challenged by the defence such evidence is considered as proved.

His Lordship M.M.A. Gaffoor J. in Ambagahagedara Nimal Ratnayake v. Attorney

General CA 24/2011 CA Minutes 01.04.2019, alluding to this principle, observed that it

is in line with the approach adopted by the Indian Courts. His Lordship cited the decision

of Sarwan Singh v. State of Punjab (2002) AIR SC 111, which held:

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to avail himself of

the opportunity to put his case in cross examination, it must follow that the evidence tendered on

that issue ought to be accepted.

His Lordship Ranjith Silva J. in Renuka Subasinghe v. Attorney General [2007] 1

SLR 224 also refers to the same principle. Similarly, his Lordship Achala Wengappuli J.

in Joseph Nilantha Rodrigo v. Attorney General CA/HCC/204/2015 C.A. Minutes

26.06.2020 adopts the same principle. His Lordship cited the following dictum from the

judgment of Edrick de Silva v. Chandradasa de Silva 70 NLR 169:

Page 13 of 13

... Where there is ample opportunity to contradict the evidence of a witness but is not

impugned or assailed in cross-examination that is a special fact and feature in the case. It is a

matter falling within the definition of the Word "prove" in section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance,

and as trial Judge or Court must necessarily take that fact into consideration in adjudicating the

issue before it ...

A careful analysis of the dock statement (on pages 857 to 860 of the Brief) of the

Accused demonstrates that the Accused has not attempted to address any of the

incriminating evidence against him, whilst staring into the abyss of the death penalty.

Instead, it is claimed that he was framed; he denied any personal enmity towards the

deceased victim. The defence witnesses have not been successful in assailing the

Prosecutions case to create doubt in our minds. Neither in the matters referred to above,

pertaining to the confessionary statements or subsequent conduct, has there been a valid

impeachment in cross-examination.

For the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that the conviction must stand.

The appeal is dismissed.
