ARGUED &

DECIDED ON: 07th of March, 2023

HON. JUSTICE K.K.A.V. SWARNADHIPATHI

This matter was supported to get a writ order by this Court. The Petitioner in this case

had sought a writ from the High Court of Galle. However, after hearing both parties, the

learned High Court Judge of Galle delivered Order on 20. 01. 2022 dismissing the

application of the Petitioner in case No. HC Galle (Writ) 49/ 2019. Aggrieved by that

Order, the Petitioner moved the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court.

We heard both parties in Court, and the Petitioner assisted that there had been two

inquiries regarding the same matter by the Commissioner General of Agrarian Services

under the Agrarian Development Act of No. 46/ 2000 and cited a letter dated 12.08.2016

addressed by the Deputy Commissioner of Agrarian Development in Galle District to the

Commissioner General of Agrarian Services and also which is marked as 2 and also

pointed out that in the submissions submitted to the High Court, the Respondents have

admitted that they have held two inquires. The document marked as P3 referred to the

first inquiry as No. DAD/ GL/LEG.06/ and the second inquiry as 7/7/10/GA/7-

139.

However, in reply, it was brought to the notice of this Court that the letter referred to as

2 is not an inquiry report. It was only a site inspection carried out by the Assistant

Officer of the Chief Engineer. On the site inspection, he had ordered that he felt it was a

boundary dispute and to dissolve the matter in the proper Court. However, he had also

referred to Annexure 1, which was not referred to by any party and the matter was again

referred to the Agrarian Services Department, where at that point, it was held that an

inquiry should be held according to Section 90 (1 ) of the Act. The Section has permitted

and gives all authority to the Commissioner General to hold a proper inquiry. Section 101

of the Act speaks of agricultural roads, and Section 90 (1 ) speaks of interference of

cultivation rights, threshing rights, rights using a threshing floor, right of removing

agricultural products or the right to use agricultural roads. This means if there is a dispute

regarding access to agricultural land before going to Court, the Commissioner General

of Agrarian Services has the right to hold an inquiry. That inquiry should be conducted

by leading evidence, cross-examining, and considering all other documentary evidence

available.

The first inquiry, which is a site inspection, used the word referring to the

. That is very clear that it was only a site inspection and not an inquiry

under Section 90 (1) of the Agrarian Development Services Act.

Therefore, we are of the view that the High Court Judge had not erred, and we have no

reason to disturb or interfere with the Judgment delivered by the High Court Judge of

Galle.

Therefore, we dismiss the application.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

PRASANTHA DE SILVA, J.

I agree.
