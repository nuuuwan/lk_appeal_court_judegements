BAIL ORDER

P.Kumararatnam,J.

The Petitioner filing this Application has invoked the jurisdiction of this

Court to grant bail to him upon suitable condition as this Court

consider appropriate.

The Petitioner had applied for bail in the High Court of Gampaha in

HC/Negombo/Bail Application No.81/2022. After an inquiry, the

Learned High Court Judge had refused bail on 07.09.2022. Aggrieved

by the said order, the Petitioner had filed this Revision Application to

revise the said order.

On 01.04.2021, The Petitioner was arrested by officers from the Police

Narcotic Bureau alleging that he had aided and abetted 1st accused

named above to traffic 186 grams of Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) and

CPA 123-2022

3 | P a g e

possessing Rs.173,000/- at the time of arrest which was allegedly to

have been earned by Heroin transactions.

The Petitioner and the 1st suspect were produced, and facts were

reported to the Mahara Magistrate under Section 54A(b) and 54A(c) of

the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by

the Act No.13 of 1984 and a detention order was obtained for further

investigations under Section 82(3) of the said Act.

The production had been sent to the Government Analyst Department

on 05/04/2021. After analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded

the report to Court on 20/05/2021. According to the Government

Analyst, 32.05 grams of pure Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) had been

detected from the substance sent for the analysis.

The Petitioner was indicted in the High Court of Gampaha under two

counts namely:

2. The accused Petitioner aided and abetted the 1st accused on

the indictment to traffic 32.05 grams of Heroin punishable

under Section 54A (b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs (Amendment) Act No.13 of 1984 read with under

Section 102 of the Penal Code.

3. The accused Petitioner was in possession of Rs.173,000/- at

the time of arrest which was earned by Heroin transactions

and thereby committed an offence under Section 3(1) of the

Money Laundering Act No.05 of 2006.

The contention of the prosecution is that the 1st accused had come in a

three-wheeler and got down at Srimavo Bandaranayake Mawatha in

Sapugaskanda. At that time, he was taken into custody by the officers

of the Police Narcotics Bureau and recovered a parcel contained Heroin

from his trouser pocket. The Petitioner was the driver of the three-

wheeler in which the 1st accused had travelled. It was also alleged that

the Petitioner was in possession of Rs.173,000/- which the officers of

CPA 123-2022

4 | P a g e

the Police Narcotics Bureau had suspected as the money earned by

Heroin transactions.

The contention of the Petitioner is that the said money was recovered

from his house and the money had been earned through lawful means.

Hence, he vehemently denies the above allegation.

Although the Petitioner have three previous convictions the operation

period the suspended sentence in all three cases were over at present.

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in

support of his Revision Application.

1. According to the facts of the case the prosecution will not be able

to prove a prima facie case against the Petitioner.

2. In the light of the facts of this case the remand period that the

Petitioner had spent could be considered as an exceptional

ground.

In Nasher v. Director of Public Prosecution [2020] VSCA 144 the

court held that:

a combination of delay, onerous custodial conditions, and the

relative weakness of the prosecution case may, when considered

with all relevant circumstances, compel the conclusion that

exceptional circumstances have been established.

According to the Learned State Counsel, the Petitioner was arrested in

connection of aiding and abetting the 1st accused of trafficking of 32.05

grams of Heroin. Steps had already been taken to indict the Petitioner

in the High Court of Gampaha and the case number is HC 81/2022.

The trial is fixed for 10th and 30th May,2023 and summons had already

been sent to all necessary witnesses. Hence, Learned State Counsel

submitted that the delay is not an exceptional circumstance to be

CPA 123-2022

5 | P a g e

considered to enlarge the suspect on bail. Further, the time spent for

preparing the indictment does not constitute an exceptional

circumstance.

The Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the suspect is in remand for

little more than two years. Considering the facts and the circumstances

of this case, the prosecution will not be able to establish a prima facie

case against the Petitioner.

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what

is exceptional circumstances must be considered on its own facts and

circumstances on a case by case.

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

In CA(PHC) APN 17/12 and CA(PHC) APN 16/12 the court observed

the fact that indictment was not served even after the laps of one year

from the producing of the Government Analysts Report was considered

as exceptional circumstances.

In CA(PHC)APN 107/2018 decided on 19.03.2019 held that remanding

for a period of one year and five months without being served with the

in indictment was considered inter alia in releasing the suspect on bail.

According to the Petitioner, at present her family is going through

untold hardship without proper income and care. The Petitioner admits

that he had three previous convictions and in all three cases he was

awarded suspended sentence and the operational period of all the cases

CPA 123-2022

6 | P a g e

were over. The Petitioner had attached his previous conviction report

along with the Petition.

In respect of the 3rd charge, the Petitioner submits that although he was

indicted under Money Laundering Act, the prosecution will not be able

to prove the same as the said money was not recovered from his

custody at the time of arrest as alleged by the prosecution.

The Section 83 of the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act

which was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states:

83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under

sections 54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail

by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 84 and 85, a person

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A

and section 54B-

(a) of which the pure quantity of the dangerous drug, trafficked,

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A;

and

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment, shall not

be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in exceptional

circumstances.

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in

exceptional circumstances.

In this case the pure quantity of Heroin detected in the production by

the Government Analyst is 32.05 grams. Hence, this Court has

jurisdiction to consider granting of bail as per the new amendment.

CPA 123-2022

7 | P a g e

In this case, as per the submission of the Learned State Counsel that

the indictment has been dispatched to the High Court High Court of

Gampaha and the trial date had been already fixed. Although the

indictment had been forwarded and the case is fixed for trial, the delay

more than two year in remand does not falls into the category of

excessive and oppressive delay considering the circumstances of this

case.

Offences under Section 54A(b) and 54A(c) of the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is no

doubt serious offences but seriousness of the offence alone cannot form

a ground to refuse bail. In considering these matters, the court must

bear in mind the presumption of innocence.

Considering all these factors into account, I order the suspect to be

granted with following strict bail conditions.

1. Cash bail of Rs.100,000/=.

2. To provide 02 sureties. They must sign a bond of two million

each.

3. The suspect and the sureties must reside in the address given

until conclusion of his case.

4. Not to approach any prosecution witnesses directly or indirectly

or to interfere with.

5. To surrender his passport if any, to court and not to apply for a

travel document. The Controller of the Immigration and

Emigration is informed of the travel ban on the suspect.

6. To report to the Police Narcotics Bureau on the last Sunday of

every month between 9am to 1pm.

7. Any breach of these conditions is likely to result in the

cancellation of his bail.

The Learned High Court Judge of Gampaha is hereby directed to

enlarge the suspect on the above bail conditions.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this order to the
