Judgment

It is difficult to understand as to why in 66 cases, such a confusing way of

naming of parties is employed, such as 1st respondent of the Party of the First

Part and 2nd petitioner of the Party of the Second Part. It is from the Fiscals

report of the Execution of the Writ dated 18th October 2022, that, this Court

finally understands that Galhenage Dhammika Perera and Bhathiya Anuruddha

are the persons evicted from the premises in question, whereas,

Sammuarachchige Krishanthi and Sammuarachchige Pradeepa Mahendrani are

the persons who obtained possession.

Hence it appears that the 2nd party 1st respondent petitioner before this Court in

his application dated 18th November 2022 is Bhathiya Anuruddha alias Bhathiya

Anuruddha Kumarasinghe. For clarity he will be known as the judgment debtor

petitioner. The opponent parties, S. A. Krishanthi and S. A. Pradeepa

Mahindrani will be known as judgment creditor respondents. Galhenage

Dhammika Perera, who was evicted by the above writ, but not added himself as

a petitioner before this Court is judgment debtor respondent.

As per the petition of Bhathiya Anuruddha Kumarasinghe, judgment debtor

petitioner, proceedings were instituted by the OIC, Police Station, Maharagama

on 15.06.2022 under section 66(1) of Primary Court Procedure Act No. 44 of

1979. Hence the task of the learned Primary Court Judge is to find out as to who

was in possession on the said date and to determine whether any person has

3 | C . A . R I I 2 3 2 0 2 2 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N i e l I d d a w a l a

been forcibly ousted from possession during the 2 month period immediately

prior to the said date.

AS per the Petitioner, the judgment creditor respondents have appeared before

the learned Primary Court Judge on 15.06.2022. They were the parties who

made complaints dated 07.04.2022 and 06.06.2022 to the Police that the

petitioner has threatened the respondents to vacate the premises. There was

another complaint made by the respondent 10.06.2022 and two other

complaints dated 12.06.2022 and 13.06.2022 that the petitioner has entered

into the premises and not allowing the respondent to enter.

On 15.06.2022, the learned Primary Court Judge has issued notices to be affixed

on the land and the next date was 06.07.2022.

The original case record was called by the Court and it shows the above at page

04 of the Journal Sheet.

The petitioner states that he attended the Court on 06.07.2022 but due to the

fuel crisis cases were not called in open court and by notice rescheduled for

09.11.2022.

This is shown by the seal affixed at the top of page 06 of the Journal Sheet which

says the next date is 09.11.2022.

But on 06.07.2022 the case has been called upon the motion of Mrs. S. M. E.

Nanayakkara, Attorney-at-Law for the respondents. The learned Primary Court

Judge has (re)issued notices to be affixed on the land for 15.07.2022.

The petitioner admits that he received a notice to appear in Court on 15.07.2022

(vide., paragraph 06 of the original petition)

His position is that he attended on that day, i.e., 15.07.2022, but the cases were

not called in open court and by notice they were postponed for 18.11.2022.

Although there is no seal to this effect in the journal sheet, it appears that Mrs.

Nanayakkara has again made an application on 15.07.2022 and the Court has

4 | C . A . R I I 2 3 2 0 2 2 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N i e l I d d a w a l a

re issued notices to be affixed on the land for 29.07.2022. The position of the

petitioner is that despite that order no notice was affixed on the land or served

on him. Hence his understanding was that the next date of the case is

18.11.2022.

On 29.07.2022 the learned Primary Court Judge has treated the petitioner as a

party defaulted. The Court has fixed the case for order giving a date for the

respondents, Krishanthi and Mahindrani to file written submissions. The order

was delivered on 07.10.2022 and possession was given to the said respondents.

It was thus, the writ of possession, referred to at the beginning of this judgment,

was executed.

The respondents when noticed took up two preliminary objections before this

Court. They are,

(i) The seal of the Justice of the Peace who placed his signature on the

affidavit of the petitioner before this Court is at Hemmathagama in the

Sabaragamuwa Province, whereas the affidavit says it was affirmed to in

Colombo and

(ii) The petitioner has not acted with due diligence

In SENANAYAKE VS COMMISSIONER OF NATIONAL HOUSING AND OTHERS, C.

A. 848/2001, the facts were,

This matter was taken up before a Divisional Bench in view of the

necessity to reconsider the decision of this Court in Ceylon Workers'

Congress v. S. Sathasivam and Another(1) in the context of a preliminary

objection taken on behalf of the 6th Respondent that the affidavit of the

Petitioner dated 8th June, 2001 affirmed to at Colombo before

Wijesurendra Lokuge, Justice of the Peace in not valid insofar as he has

only been appointed as a Justice of the Peace for the Judicial District of

Homagama.

It was decided,

5 | C . A . R I I 2 3 2 0 2 2 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N i e l I d d a w a l a

(i) Application for prerogative relief - the Court of Appeal enjoys a

supervisory jurisdiction. (ii) Court should not non-suit a party where the

non-compliance with Rules takes place due to no fault of the party. (iii)

Strict or absolute compliance with a Rule is not essential; it is sufficient if

there is compliance which is substantial, this being judged in the light of

the object and purpose of these Rules. It is not to be mechanically applied.

Courts in this country have moved from applying strict rules in respect of

affidavits to being more liberal, taking a pragmatic approach conducive of

unalloyed justice.

In M. Tudor Danister Anthony Fernando Vs. Rankiri Hettiarachchige Fredie Perera,

SC/HCCA/L.A Case No. 279/2012, Priyantha Jayawardane J., said,

In Mohamed Rauf Mohamed Facy v. Mohamed Azath Sanoon Sally SC

minutes S.C. Appeal No. 4/2004 Marsoof J. analyzed Section 9 of the

Oaths and Affirmation Ordinance and stated ' This is a salutary provision

which was intended to remedy the very malady that has occurred in this

case, and clearly covers a situation in which there is a substitution in the

jurat of an affirmation for an oath.

Edussuriya J. in Trico Freighters (Pvt) Ltd. v. Yang Civil Engineering Lanka

(Pvt). Ltd (2000) 2 SLR 136 was of the view ' Substitution of an oath for an

affirmation (or vice versa) will not invalidate proceedings or shut out

evidence. The fundamental objection of a witness or the deponent is to tell

the truth and the purpose of an oath is to enforce that obligation. '

However, in the case of Mark Rajandran v. First Capital Ltd. Formerly,

Commercial Capital Ltd. ( 2010 ) 1 SLR 60 it was held that the Petitioner

has clearly averred that he is a Christian in the affidavit and making oath,

in the jurat, the Petitioner had affirmed to the averments before the Justice

of Peace. It is therefore, clearly evident that since the petitioner does not

come within the category of religions referred to in Section 5 of the Oaths

6 | C . A . R I I 2 3 2 0 2 2 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N i e l I d d a w a l a

and Affirmation Ordinance, the exception would not be applicable to him

to make an affirmation instead of the oath he should have made.

I am inclined to agree with the cases of Mohamed Rauf Mohamed Facy

v. Mohamed Azath Sanoon Sally and Trico Freighters (Pvt) Ltd. v.

Yang Civil Engineering Lanka (Pvt). Ltd and not with the decision in

the case of Mark Rajandran v. First Capital Ltd. Formerly,

Commercial Capital Ltd.

It cannot be said that the petitioner did not act with due diligence or utmost

promptitude, because he could not have, as the facts would show, been aware of

proceedings in his absence until he was evicted on 18.10.2022 and by

14.11.2022 he has come before this Court.

As far as the facts of the case are concerned, it is clear that the petitioner

Kumarasinghe has not been informed of the date 29.07.2022, which was

obtained by the respondents upon filing a motion on 15.07.2022. Not only that

he was not informed of 29.07.2022 date but misled by the notice to the effect

that the cases for 15.07.2022 will be called on 18.11.2022. Hence he could not

have been treated a party at default. In making a decision to that effect on

29.07.2022, the learned Primary Court Judge has not acted with due diligence.

It has violated the fundamental principle of audi alteram partem.

On the other hand, the petitioner himself has referred to complaints made by the

respondents closer upon the date of the filing of the information, that, the

petitioner Kumarasinghe recently forcibly entered into possession.

7 | C . A . R I I 2 3 2 0 2 2 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N i e l I d d a w a l a

As per the Fiscals report, when Fiscal visited the premises on 18.10.2022, the

house in the possession of Bhathiya Anuruddha Kumarasinghe, the petitioner

was being painted. Although this is not conclusive evidence of recently assumed

possession, for people paint their houses even long after first occupation, as per

the fiscals report there is no evidence of a family being evicted from a dwelling

house.

Therefore, although the powers of this Court in restitutio in integrum and

revision do compel this Court to decide in favour of the petitioner Kumarasinghe,

since the said powers are discretionary, this Court does not order the eviction of

the respondents placed in possession of the premises on 18.10.2022, pending

the determination of the Primary Court Action.

The learned Primary Court Judge has failed to consider the affidavits of the

parties she thought duly before her, the respondents, too. She had only

considered written submissions which has no evidentiary value. In addition the

petitioner, Kumarasinghe, as said above was not clearly a defaulted party. Hence

the order and the proceedings in the Primary Court after 15.07.2022 are bad in

law. Hence, exercising the power of restitutio in integrum setting aside the order

and the said proceedings, parties are restored to their respective positions on

15.07.2022.

Hence, whereas the status quo as to the possession of the premises shall be

maintained, the learned Primary Court Judge will allow the petitioner and

respondents to file affidavits, counter affidavits and documents and shall

determine the following,

(1) Who was in possession of the premises on 15.06.2022,

(2) Whether any person or persons was forcibly evicted from that possession

during the period of 02 months prior to the said date,

The learned Primary Court Judge will accordingly made his/her order. It is

further directed that the proceedings shall be continued before a learned Judge

other than the learned Judge who already made the order dated 07.10.2022.

The Registrar is directed to send the original case record to the Magistrates Court

of Nugegoda.

There is no order on costs.
