Sasi Mahendran, J.

The instance Appeal has been logged to set aside the Judgement dated 07th of

December 2009 by the High Court of Colombo.

The Accused Appellants (hereinafter referred to as "the Accused") were indicted

before the High Court of Colombo for the possession and trafficking of 141.3g of Heroin

(Diacetylmorphine) under Section 54A(d) and 54A(b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

The prosecution, in order to substantiate the charges examined five witnesses. The

Government Analyst expressed his opinion that it is Heroin. After the trial, the Learned

High Court Judge found the Accused guilty on both counts, convicted, and life

imprisonment was imposed.

The following are the grounds of appeal led by the Learned Counsel for the

Accused.

i.That the case of the Prosecution is untenable and does not pass the test of probability.

The following occasions have been cited as instances where doubt has been cast on the

case of the Prosecution:

a. That ten Police Officers participated in the raid but only five Police Officers

entered the house.

Page 4 of 15

b. That, not a single Accused tried to flee when the Police Officer PW1 broke

into the premises and ordered the Accused to remain there.

c. That PWI did not clearly see what the Accused was doing as he entered the

room but inferred that they were engaged in the packaging of heroin from

the implements recovered from the scene. Whereas if all the Accused were

engaged in the packaging of heroin, there should have been more

implements.

d. That the police officers who conducted the raid, being experienced officers

of the Narcotics Bureau did not check the amount of heroin recovered from

each individual Accused but they collected all the heroin in a single parcel

and sealed it.

e. That the journey to the scene of the crime lasted fifteen minutes but the

return journey took fifty minutes and thereby renders the version of the

prosecution improbable.

ii. That there is insufficient evidence to convict the 2nd - 12th Accused

iii. That the Accused has been denied of his right to a fair trial as the observations of

the learned High Court Judge contained in the judgment give rise to an

appearance of bias.

iv. That the learned High Court Judge failed to give the benefit of the doubt arising

from the lack of the Government Analyst's report.

v. That the learned High Court Judge failed to correctly evaluate the burden of proof

in this matter.

The story of the prosecution was that a group of police officers, led by Prosecution

Witness 01, P Amarajith De Silva (hereinafter referred to as PW01) upon receiving

information from Prosecution Witness 02s (PW02) private informant about an individual

named Imthiyas (hereinafter referred to as the 1st Accused) involved in trafficking

Page 5 of 15

narcotics, had gone to Wellampitiya on 18.05.1996 at around 2.00 pm to conduct the raid.

They observed through a grill the 1st and the 2nd Accused at the said house were packing

some substances in paper. The officers promptly barged into the said premises and

detained all the Accused within the premises which amounted to 12 individuals. Along

with the Accused, they also seized several metal foils with small amounts of Heroin

already packed in foil, 2 lamps, blades, a plastic spoon, bundles of metal foils, and

cellophane bags.

Further, a brown colour substance packed in a cellophane bag which was in

between the legs of the 1st Accused was recovered and after examination by the officers,

it was suspected to be Heroin.

On page 132 of the Appeal brief ;

: . .

.

The officers afterward packed and weighed the productions found near 1st Accused

separately (weighing 161 grams and 15miligrams) whereas they packed and weighed the

rest of the production found at the said locations collectively (weighing 115 grams and 100

milligrams). According to the Government Analyst, they have analyzed both parcels

separately and according to the Government Analysis report, the parcel recovered from

the 1st Accused had 80.1 grams of Heroin, other Parcel contained 61.2g of Heroin. With a

total of 141.3 grams. According to the Indictment, all were charged for joint possession of

141.3 grams of Heroin.

The accused position is that the story of the prosecution could not be believed, as

the events that transpired during the trial by the prosecution are improbable.

This Court has to decide whether the following events are believable or not.

What it is probability was discussed by Justice Jayasooriya In Wickremasinghe v.

Dedoleena and others 1996 (2) SLR held that;

A Judge, in applying the test of probabilities and improbability relies heavily on

his knowledge of men and matters and the pattern of conduct observed by human beings

both ingenious as well as those who are less talented and fortunate.

Page 6 of 15

this proposition was followed by Justice Gooneratne in, Singharam Thiyagarajah v. AG

CA 216/2010 Decided on 27.11.2014 held that

I wish to observe that the realities of life and the testimony of a witness cannot

always be co-related. Nothing is perfect in life and the truth does not surface so easily as

a man so bias could attempt to hide the truth or distort it. The test of probability need to

be applied and recognized to grapple with normal human behavior and problems and pave

the way for the likelihood of occurrence.

We draw the following evidence that transpired at the trial.

According to PW01s evidence, Without any hesitation, he has given the reason

why he has not indicated the place of the raid in his outward journey.

Page 126 of Appeal brief

: ?

: . .

. .

.

Theres another question put forward by the defence that the PW01 has not

followed rules of the section 17(4) of the Police Ordinance.

Page 127 of the Appeal brief

: .

17(4) .

: . .

but we are mindful that this raid took place on a tip-off, is it practical for them to

follow all the rules and regulations before they leave the place?

On page 139 of the Appeal brief;

1930 . .

,.

Page 7 of 15

also, they have indicated that except for Inspector Saman Kumara, all the other officers

were in their civil attires.

One of the defences was that the journey to the scene of the crime was 15 minutes

but the return journey took 50 minutes, therefore the story of the prosecution is

improbable.

According to PW01, he has explained the reason for taking more time to return

from the scene. According to him, it was a Saturday and there was heavy traffic.

We hold that time of departure and arrival time was mentioned by PW01 is

acceptable, there's no reason for him to give false timing. We Accepted the explanation

given by PW01 regarding the time difference. We hold that there is no reason to disbelieve

him.

The defence contends that the version of the prosecution where 10 police officers

participated in the raid but only five police officers entered the house, is highly improbable

and therefore casts doubt on the version of the prosecution.

According to PW01, since the house is very small and area was highly populated

he kept 3 officers to guard the surrounding the area and other two officers to guard the

vehicle. We are mindful that officers are well trained and they have their own pattern of

conducting the raid. therefore there is no need for us to disbelieve his version.

Another point taken by the defence was that not a single of the 12 Accused

attempted to flee when the police officers entered is highly unlikely and casts doubt on

the case of the prosecution.

But according to the evidence of PW01, they have recovered one parcel which was

hidden by the 1st Accused. This piece of evidence was not disputed by the defence. It shows

that accused didnt have sufficient time to react. Furthermore, we observed that there

were only two doors and they were guarded by the officers therefore there was no way for

them to flee.

We dont see any improbability of the prosecution version.

Considering the evidence of PW01 this evidence is probable and there is no doubt

created by the defence regarding the raid.

Page 8 of 15

Therefore, we hold that the Learned High Court Judge correctly accepted the

evidence of PW01.

In the instant case, all the Accused were charged under joint possession and

trafficking of Heroin and convicted on the basis that all the Accused were presented in

the said location at the time of the raid.

The issue is whether the 2nd to 12th Accused had the requisite knowledge that the

parcel concealed by the 1st Accused contained Heroin.

Lord Wilberforce in Warner v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner (1968) 52

Criminal Appeal Report 373. has considered this matter;

The question, to which an answer is required, and in the end, a jury must answer

it, is whether in the circumstances the Accused should be held to have possession of the

substance, rather than mere control. In order to decide between these two, the jury should,

in my opinion, be invited to consider all the circumstances- to use again the words of

Pollock and Wright, possession in the common law, P. 119- the modes or events by which

the custody commences and the legal incident in which it is held. By these I mean, relating

them to typical situations, that they must consider the manner and circumstances in

which the substance, or something which contains it, had been received, what knowledge

or means of knowledge or guilty knowledge as to the presence of the substance, or as to

the nature of what has been received, the Accused had at the time of receipt or thereafter

up to the moment when he is found with it; his legal relation to the substance or package

(including his right of access to it). On such matters as these (not exhaustively stated)

they must make the decision whether, in addition to physical control, he has, or ought to

have imputed to him the intention to possess, or knowledge that he does possess, what is,

in fact, a prohibited substance. If he has this intention or knowledge, it is not additionally

necessary that he should know the nature of the substances.

This proposition was considered by His Lordship Ismail, J in his Judgement on K.

Sumanawathi Perera v. Attorney General 1998 2 SLR 20, held that;

We have taken these facts into consideration and applying the observations of

Lord Wilberforce, referred to above, we are of the view that the accused-appellant has

succeeded in creating a reasonable doubt in regard to the question whether she did possess

the requisite knowledge required for the purpose of proving charges in the indictment

Page 9 of 15

against her. We are of the view that it would be appropriate to extend the benefit of the

doubt in this regard to the accused-appellant.

Recently His Lordship Aluwihare PC J in the case of Mohamed Iqbal Mohamed

Sadath v. Attorney General, SC Appeal 110/15, (SC Minutes 14.12.2020), held:

Lord Wilberforce went on to state that, on such matters as above, though not

exhaustively stated, it must be decided whether, in addition to physical control, he has or

ought to have imputed to him, the intention to possess or knowledge that he does possess,

what is in fact a prohibited substance. The above reasoning in my view is a rational

guideline that should be adopted in deciding as to whether the Accused had the knowledge

(the requisite mens rea) that what he possessed is a prohibited substance, even though he

may not have known the precise nature of the substance.

Further in an Indian Judgement Justice Dipak Mishra, J in Mohan Lal v. State

of Rajasthan, Criminal Appeal No. 1393 of 2010, Decided on 17.04.2015, held that;

Term "possess." Under narcotic drug laws, means actual control, care, and

management of the drug. Collini v. State [7]. Defendant 'possesses' controlled substance

when defendant knows of substance's presence, substance is immediately accessible, and

defendant exercises "dominion or control" over substance. State v. Hornaday[8].

The defendants must have had dominion and control over the contraband with

knowledge of its presence and character. U.S, v. Morando- Alvarez[11].

Dr. Harris, in his essay titled "The Concept of Possession in English Law[16]"

while discussing the various rules relating to possession has stated that "possession" is a

functional and relative concept, which gives the Judges some discretion in applying

abstract rule to a concrete set of facts. The learned author has suggested certain factors

which have been held to be relevant to conclude whether a person has acquired possession

for the purposes of a particular rule of law. Some of the factors enlisted by him are; (a)

degree of physical control exercised by person over a thing, (b) knowledge of the person

claiming possessory rights over a thing, about the attributes and qualities of the thing, (c)

the persons' intention in regard to the thing, that is, 'animus possessionis' and 'animus

domini'

Page 10 of 15

.

In the case at hand, the appellant, we hold, had the requisite degree of control

when, even if the said narcotic substance was not within his physical control at that

moment. To give an example, a person can conceal prohibited narcotic substance in a

property and move out thereafter. The said person because of necessary animus would be

in possession of the said substance even if he is not, at the moment, in physical control.

Now I turn to the English judgments which dealt with the joint possession

Lord Widgery CJ, in R v. Searle and Others, The Criminal Law Review

1971,page592 held that;

allowing the appeals, the effect of those parts of the summing -up was to equate

knowledge with possession. However, mere knowledge of the presence of a forbidden

article in the hands of a confederate was not enough: joint possession had to be

established. The sort of direction which ought to have been given was to ask the jury to

consider whether the drugs formed a common pool from which all had the right to draw

at will, and whether there was a joint enterprise to consume drugs together because then

the possession of drugs by one of them in pursuance of that common intention might well

be possession on the part of all of them: Thompson (1869) 21 L.T. 397. The summing-up

was inadequate and possibly misleading. Although there was ample evidence to justify a

conviction it was impossible to say with certainty that all the defendants were guilty and

so it was not a case in which the proviso could be applied.

Chief Justice, Mr. Drake and Justice Henry, in James MC Namara, 1988 (87) Cr.

App.R. 246, has stated that;

The situation in the present case with which we are dealing is, to pick up Lord

Wilberforce's words, a non-ideal form of possession, namely, holding by the defendant of

a box and its contents, which perhaps it is convenient to refer to as box-possession,

observing, as we do, that we appreciate the danger of begging the question altogether by

the use of the word "possession." The defendant admittedly has control of a box which he

knows contains a "thing" which he has not seen. If he knows what the thing is, no problem

arises. But what if the defendant knows that the box contains something, but is mistaken

as to the nature of that thing? That is to say, in terms of the present case, what if he knew

Page 11 of 15

that the box contained something, but he thought it was pornographic or pirated video

films, whereas in fact it was undoubtedly cannabis resin?

R. v. Bland, Criminal LR 1988 41 at page 42, Held that;

allowing the appeal and quashing the conviction, there was no evidence of

assistance, active or passive; the fact that the appellant and Ratcliff lived together in the

same room was not sufficient evidence from which the jurv could draw such an inference.

There was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have inferred knowledge on the

appellant's part that Ratcliff was drug-dealing, but no more. Assistance, though passive,

required more than mere knowledge; for example, it required evidence of encouragement

at least, or of some element of control, which was entirely lacking in the case. The case

should have been withdrawn from the jury.

May L. J., in Gareth Edmund Lewis, 1988 (87) Cr. App.R. Page 270 held:

We respectfully agree that Warner's case is the leading authority on this

particular question. But as has so often been said in different contexts, particularly in

criminal jurisprudence, the question of what constitutes "possession" is an illusive concept

at common law. It depends so much on the circumstances of the particular case, as well

as the wording and intent, for instance, of the particular statute creating the offence under

consideration. It is no doubt for this reason that the speeches in Warner's case seem to us,

respectfully, to reflect a substantial number of different shades of meaning and approach

from which it is not easy to distil a conclusion supported by the majority of the House

which is relevant to the instant appeal. In this connection, we have been greatly assisted

by the headnote in the Criminal Appeal Reports, which seems to us accurately and

conveniently to summarise the decision.

The House of Lords certainly decided, though with Lord Reid dissenting, that the

relevant statute created an absolute offence. This is in the sense that in order to be

satisfied of guilt, there is no need for the jury to be satisfied of any mental element in the

ingredients of the offence, such as we used to describe as mens rea. However, in our view

herein lies one of the difficulties in applying the decision in Warner's case because,

notwithstanding that the offence is an absolute one, a majority of their Lordships

expressed the view that some mental element is required before a jury can be satisfied

that the defendant is truly "in possession" of the relevant drugs.

Page 12 of 15

"On this basis I think that the notion of having something in one's possession

involves a mental element. It involves in the first place that you know that you have

something in your possession. It does not, however, involve that you know precisely what

it is that you have got." And, at p.403 and p.289, the learned Law Lord said: "The question

resolves itself into one as to the nature and extent of the mental element which is involved

in 'possession' as that word is used in the section now being considered."

In the instant case as the law stands now prosecution, has failed to discharge its

burden of establishing the requisite mental element presumptively by adducing evidence

in which the heroin contained in the parcel has been recovered from the 1st Accused where

other Accused had knowledge.

The evidence placed before the trial court is that the police had recovered two

parcels in which one parcel was concealed by the 1st Accused and, the other one was found

in the middle of the place where the other accused were packing. Although the

Government Analyst separately weighed the quantity of Heroin in each parcel separately,

both quantities were put together and indicted all Accused under joint possession.

We are mindful that the parcel recovered from the 1st Accused was hidden by

himself and was not visible to the other Accused. There is evidence to show that only one

spoon was used in the packaging process.

The question arises, whether the prosecution had led the evidence that the other

accused had the knowledge (requisite mens rea) that the parcel contained a prohibited

substance (Heroin).

Although the evidence does not clearly show that the other Accused (2nd -12th

Accused) had knowledge about the parcel which was in between the legs of the 1st Accused,

there is no doubt about the fact that all Accused were aware that the other parcel found

in front of them contained Heroin, because all of them were engaging in packing heroin

at the time of the raid.

According to the evidence all were present in the locked house with the prohibited

substance and equipped with the necessary items to pack the said substance, such as foil,

2 lamps, blades, a plastic spoon, bundles of metal foils, and cellophane bags which has

been marked and produced at the trial. Therefore it is clear that the all Accused were in

joint possession of the substance.

Page 13 of 15

And we are mindful that such a large quantity of Heroin should be considered for

the purpose of trafficking.

The presence of the Accused in the said room under the circumstances sufficient

to establish beyond reasonable doubt that they were possessing and trafficking Heroin.

The parcel was found in the commonplace.

However, in the dock statement, all the Accused offered no explanation whatsoever

for their involvement in the crime.

Upon examination of the dock statement provided by the Accused, it becomes

patently and manifestly clear that they have failed to create doubt regarding their

connection to this crime. In other words, court expects that when incriminating evidence

is adduced against the Accused, the Accused to give a reasonable explanation to the court.

if he fails the court would presume that there was no such explanation available to him.

I would like to refer to the sentiments referred by Justice F.N.D Jayasuriya along

with Justice P.H.K Kulathilaka J in the case Thalpe Liyanage Manatunga v. Attorney

General, CA No.47/98, decided on 25.08.1999, held that;

The question arises on an evaluation and analysis of the dock statement whether

the accused has attempted to explain away the incriminating circumstances elicited

against him and the prima facie case established by the prosecution by explaining away

those circumstances and stating that there was only an insertion of the male organ into

her legs and not into the private part of the virtual complainant. If such, a fact took place

and existed, it was within the power of the accused to come out with that explanation and

to refute the charge of rape. Though the accused made a dock statement he has failed to

explain away the incriminating circumstances and prima facie case established against

him by indulging in any such explanation. Then as wise and prudent judges often observe

in those circumstances both common sense and logic induce any Court to come to the

conclusion that the accused did not come out with such an explanation because such

circumstances never existed. The accused in his utterly deficient dock statement has

merely stated thus. . .

. That is the bare and the deficient dock statement made by

the accused. In view of the deficiency in the dock statement this Court is entitled to draw

the presumptions and inferences arising from such a deficiency in terms of the speeches

of Lord Ellenborough in Rex v. Cochrane-Gurneys Reports 479 and of Justice Abbott in

Rex v. Burdet (1820 4 Band Alderman 95 at 120).

Page 14 of 15

When we perused the evidence, the police had sent both parcels separately

marking numbers. The report of the Government Analyst disclosed that they had received

both parcels separately with different weights. Further Government Analyst has analyzed

it separately and indicated the pure quantity in each parcel.

When there is evidence to show that the parcel recovered from other Accused

contained Heroin, could this court deal with the certified quantity described by the

Government Analyst which was a common possession of all the Accused.

It is true that the Honorable Attorney General had sent the indictment to all the

Accused mixing the two quantities of heroin found in the 2 packs for joint possession. But

it is clear from the evidence of the Government Analyst that the parcel recovered from the

commonplace was 61.2 grams of Heroin. Therefore, this court would act on the basis to

separate the Heroin found from the 1st Accused and deal with the Parcel found in the

commonplace which exceeds 2 grams of Heroin.

A similar situation arose in the following case,

In Agampodige Samantha de Zoysa v Attorney General CA 83/97, decided on

27.10.1998. Jayasuriya J held that;

Upon this appeal according to certain inquiries made by this court it was revealed

that the accused had merely pointed out his house and this evidence of the police was to

the effect that they on their own effects and exertion discovered the heroin which was

found in the house. It is alleged that a quantity of 20 grams was discovered from that

house and the quantity of 7 grams was discovered by the police Narcotics Bureau officials

from the person of the Accused. However, the officers mixed the two quantities and make

one parcel and sent it to the Government Analyst for examination and report. The report

of the government Analysts disclosed that of the entire quantity sent to the Government

Analysts Department for examination and report. The contends of the entire parcel

contained 10.9 grams of heroin. As the officers have mixed the two quantities and

prepared one parcel for forwarding it to the Government Analyst the learned Counsel

contends that there is no evidence before the court in regard to the quantity of Heroin

found in the packets on the person of the accused and in the absence of proof a certified

quantity he contends that the Court would have to act on the basis that what was found

on the accused person did not exceed one gram of heroin.

Page 15 of 15

Therefore, we set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on the Accused, and

in substitution, we find all the Accused guilty of possession and trafficking of a quantity

of Heroin 61.2g and convict them for life imprisonment.

Subject to the variation of the sentence this Appeal is dismissed.
