The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as "the Accused") was indicted

before the High Court of Kegalle for the possession and trafficking of 7.45 grams of Heroin

(Diacetylmorphine) under Section 54A(d) and 54A(b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

Prosecution led evidence from four witnesses, and marked its productions P1 to

P15, The Accused had given evidence from the evidence box. After the trial, the Learned

High Court Judge found the Accused guilty on both counts, convicted, and the death

sentence was imposed.

Being aggrieved by said judgment and sentence this appeal was preferred by the

Accused.

The following are the grounds of appeal led by the Learned Counsel for the Accused

i. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the prosecution case is

improbable.

ii. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the Appellants evidence.

iii. The Learned High Court Judge has cast an unwarranted burden on the

Defense case.

The facts of the case are briefly summarised as follows:

PW1, IP Sumanasekara, upon receiving information from a private informant on

the 14th of August 2017 regarding a suspicious individual (the Accused) loitering in the

area, led a team of officers to the scene. While the team wore civilian clothes, PW1 was in

uniform. They departed the police station at 16:55 hours, heading towards Dadigama

templea kilometre away in a private vehicle. Upon arriving at the destination at 17:00

hours, amidst rice fields, he spotted an individual on a motorcycle on the side road. Based

on the description received earlier an individual wearing a shirt and pantsand the

suspicious behavior noted, PW1 concluded that this was the person in question. They

parked the van near the Accused. According to PW1, the Accused appeared agitated and

fearful upon seeing PW1 in uniform. Subsequently, PW1 proceeded to search him,

discovering a large grocery bag and another bag containing 18 small bags of a white

Page 3 of 6

substance packed in small portions in the left side pocket of his trousers. He examined

the discolored substance and, feeling his nose become stuffy, identified it as heroin based

on his expertise. Upon inquiry, the Accused was arrested at 17:20 hours, and the bags

were taken into custody. Meanwhile, the motorcycle was driven by P.S 57416 Lalith (PW3)

to the police station. They then visited a jewelry shop, placed the white substance on

tissue paper, and weighed it. The substance weighed 15 g and 970 mg. Subsequently, he

wrapped the substance in tissue paper, placed it along with the 18 bags in separate

envelopes, sealed them, and transported them to the police station. At the station, the

substance wrapped in tissue paper was entered as P.R No. 406/17 and handed over to the

Production Reserve Officer P.C 14051 Ranasinghe (PW6) at 18:10 hours. The motorcycle

bearing no. WP-TX 3411, its keys, and other productions were marked as P.R No. 407/17.

During cross-examination, PW1 admitted to not recording the vehicle number nor

providing details concerning the van used in the raid. When queried, he explained the

omission as a measure to maintain the vehicle's privacy. He recalled that post-raid, while

en route back, PW2 sat in the front seat of the van, with PW1, the Accused, and the rest

of the officers occupying the backseats. The motorcycle was taken into custody by PW3.

He confirmed that the substance was weighed in the presence of the other officers and the

Accused, before proceeding to the police station. It was acknowledged that the time taken

post-arrest and the time spent at the jewelry shop for weighing the substance were

accurately accounted for, affirming that the raid was properly conducted.

Considering the evidence provided by PW1, we find his testimony truthful and consistent,

making him a reliable witness whose evidence can be accepted.

On the 4th of September 2020, the defense counsel admitted the following facts

under Section 420 of the Criminal Procedure Code:

1. The production entered as P.R No. 406/17 was properly sent to the Government

Analyst Department without breaking the Chain of Custody.

2. The Government Analyst report concerning the analysis of the production was

accepted.

PW2, S.I Hidurangala, corroborated the account of PW1, noting that on the 14th

of August 2017, he was briefed by PW1 about a suspicious individual near Dadigama

Temple. Along with a team of officers, they departed the police station at 16:55 hours. His

testimony effectively aligned with PW1's regarding the arrest, search, and discovery of 18

pink small bags containing heroin from the Accused's left trouser pocket. Post-arrest,

Page 4 of 6

they, alongside the Accused, visited a jewelry shop where PW1 weighed the substance,

which totaled 15g and 970mg. Subsequently, the Accused's motorcycle bearing no. WP-

TX 3411 was taken into custody by PW3.

In cross-examination, PW2 acknowledged traveling in a private vehicle, albeit

without recalling its number, citing its private ownership as the reason. He confirmed the

seating arrangements during the raid, and post-raid, which corroborated with PW1's

account. Additionally, he detailed the arrest and subsequent actions, including the

weighing of the substance. He mentioned that the journey to the jewelry shop took around

10 to 15 minutes due to road conditions, and the subsequent processes, including

returning to the police station, took about 15 to 20 minutes, although he could not confirm

the exact duration. The defense's claim of three motorcycles being used for the raid, and

the apprehension of the Accused was refuted by PW2.

In this case, evaluating the credibility and testimonial trustworthiness of the

witnesses is a question of fact, not law. We find no contradictions that undermine the core

of the case as recounted. PW2 displayed no discrepancies throughout his testimony,

leaving no room for disbelief. In our view, the evidence presented by PW1 and PW2 has

been thoroughly corroborated, and we accept the aforementioned prosecution witnesses'

evidence as creditworthy. Upon analyzing these witnesses' testimonies, it is evident that

they participated in the aforementioned raid and bore witness to the events as they

unfolded.

The Accuseds version

The Accused, under oath, recounted that on the relevant day, he left his wifes

house for work at 5:00 a.m. Later, at 1:35 p.m., he arrived at a communication center

situated at Nelum Deniya to repair his mobile phone. He then decided to visit Dedigama

Temple to see the Chief Monk about and traveled there on his motorcycle. Upon

arrival at 2:00 p.m., he parked his motorcycle inside the temple premises and waited for

around 10 minutes for the Chief Monk. During this waiting period, he was walking around

the temple. After meeting with the Chief Monk and as he was preparing to leave, he was

approached by a group of officers who arrived on three motorcycles. He was then

summoned to the Police Station by the O.I.C., although he was clueless about the

unfolding situation. Another officer took his bike to the Police station while he was

escorted between two officers to the same location. At the station, the O.I.C. questioned

Page 5 of 6

the Accused about a temple bell theft and allegedly assaulted him. The Accused also

claimed that his money and mobile phone were confiscated.

Interestingly, the contention regarding the theft was not brought up with the

prosecution witness, which seems unusual.

Furthermore, the Accused mentioned that he was detained at 4:30 p.m., and his

wife was summoned to the police station concerning his bail but then left; this aspect was

not interrogated by the Defense Counsel either. The Accused staunchly denied all

accusations levied against him and dissociated himself from any heroin-related incidents.

It is peculiar that the Chief Monk of the Dedigama Temple was not summoned to testify

on behalf of the Accused, which could have provided more insight into the Accused's

narrative.

Upon examining the Accused's evidence, it does not generate any doubt concerning

the recovery of the heroin; it only presents a flat denial. This failure to address crucial

details in the unfolding events considerably undermines the credibility of their case. The

Accused's discourse primarily revolved around the theft allegation and his wife being

called to the police stationfacts not conveyed to the Prosecution by the Defense. This

lack of attention to key details does not arouse any suspicion towards the prosecutions

case, as perceived by this Court.

The Accused's primary grievance was that the Learned High Court Judge allegedly

erred in applying the test of probability, leading to a potentially flawed conclusion.

What is probability according to E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, in The Law of Evidence

Volume II Book 02 on Page 1052, the test of probability is described as follows:

Sir Thomas Bingham points out that if too much attention has over the years been paid

to the demeanour of the witness in guiding the trial judge to the truth, too little has

perhaps been paid to probability. One thing may be regarded as more likely to have

happened than another, with the result that the judge will reject the evidence in favour

of the less likely.

In Wickremasuriya v Dedoleena and Others (1996) 2 S.L.R. 95, His Lordship

Jayasuriya J. observed that;

A Judge, in applying the test of Probability and Improbability, relies heavily on his

knowledge of men and matters and the patterns of conduct observed by human beings

both ingenious as well as those who are less talented and fortunate."

This case was relied upon by Justice Achala Wengappuli in, Chaminda Jeewan

Ratnayake v. A.G, CA No. 185/2016 decided on 28.09.2018.

In the case at hand, the Prosecution has provided clear evidence concerning the

manner in which the raid was conducted. Upon reviewing the evidence presented to the

Learned Trial Judge, it appears that the Prosecution has offered ample evidence

substantiating the raid. PW2 meticulously outlined the journey to the designated location

and the return trip, a narrative corroborated by PW1's testimony, leaving us with no

grounds to doubt its veracity. We concur with the Learned Trial Judge's assessment in

deeming the Prosecution's account as credible and plausible.

Delving into the judgement rendered by the Learned Trial Judge, it becomes

evident that all material evidence presented during the trial by both sides was thoroughly

examined. The testimony offered by the Accused was also scrutinized and duly weighed

by the Learned Trial Judge, who further articulated the rationale behind discrediting the

defense's version of events.

Given the aforementioned considerations, it is my finding that the Accused has not

succeeded in persuading this court that the conviction in question is unattainable based

on the evidence presented before the trial court. Consequently, this court opts to dismiss

the appeal, upholding the original sentence and conviction.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
