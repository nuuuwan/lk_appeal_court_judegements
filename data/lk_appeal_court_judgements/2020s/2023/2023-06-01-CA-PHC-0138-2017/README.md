JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The 1st Respondent filed a charge sheet Under Section 47 and 54(2) of

the Excise Ordinance against the 2nd Respondent in the Magistrate

Court of Marawila. As the 2nd Respondent pleaded guilty to the charge

sheet, the Learned Magistrate of Marawila had convicted the 2nd

Respondent and imposed a fine of Rs.100000/- and fixed for an inquiry

to confiscate the Vehicle bearing No. WP KA-0456.

At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Learned Magistrate had decided to

confiscate the aforesaid vehicle by his order dated 28th April 2017. At

the inquiry only the Appellant had given evidence on his behalf.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Magistrate, the Appellant filed a

revision application in the Provincial High Court of North-western

Holden at Chilaw to revise the order of the Magistrate of Marawila. After

support, the Learned High Court Judge had dismissed the said

application without issuing notice to the Respondent.

Now the Appellant filed this appeal to set aside the order of the Learned

High Court Judge of North-western Holden at Chilaw dated

18/07/2017.

The Appellant submitted following grounds of appeal:

1. The Appellant has no right of appeal under the Excise

Ordinance against the confiscation.

2. The Learned High Court Judge had simply dismissed the

revision application filed by the Appellant without adhering to

the maxim Audi alteram partem.

It is settled law that revision is a discretionary remedy, and such power

shall be invoked only upon demonstration of exceptional

circumstances.

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

In Marian Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed 69 CLW 34 the court held that:

Power of revision is an extraordinary power of the court

which is independent and distinct from the appellate

jurisdiction. The object of revisionary jurisdiction is to ensure

the due administration of justice and the correction of all

errors in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice.

CA PHC 138/2017

In the case of Rasheed Ali v.Mohammed Ali and Others [1981] 1 SLR

262, the court held that:

the powers of revision vested in the Court of Appeal are

very wide and the Court can in a fit case exercise that

power whether or not an appeal lies. When, however, the

law does not give a right of appeal and makes the order

final, the Court of Appeal may nevertheless exercise its

powers of revision, but it should do so only in exceptional

circumstances. Ordinarily the Court will not interfere by

way of review, particularly when the law has expressly

given an aggrieved party an alternative remedy such as the

right to file a separate action, except when non-interference

will cause a denial of justice or irremediable harm.

In Commissioner of Police v. Tanes (1957-58) 68 CLR 383, the court

held that:

"It is a deep-rooted principle of the law that before anyone

can be punished or prejudiced in his person or his property

by any judicial or quasi-judicial procedure, he must be

afforded adequate opportunity of being heard ... "

In this case the Learned High Court Judge only considering the order of

the Magistrate Court of Marawila decided to dismiss the revision

application stating that that the Appellant had failed shock the

conscious of the court.

In this case a car had been confiscated for transporting 320 drams of

illicit liquor.

The Claimant of the vehicle has given evidence in the court and has

claimed that he was unaware of the crime being committed as he has

given the vehicle on rent to the accused.

CA PHC 138/2017

5 | P a g e

The Learned Magistrate has dismissed the application on the basis that

the Claimant had failed to show that he took all necessary precautions

to prevent a crime being committed.

Considering the argument advanced by the Appellant that he was not

afforded a fair inquiry, I conclude that the Learned High Court Judge

should have inquired this matter by affording an opportunity to all

necessary parties to present their submissions before he could come to

a conclusion. As this caused great prejudice to the Appellant, I decided

to send this case back to the High Court of Chilaw for re-hearing by

affording an opportunity to all necessary parties to present their

submissions.

Accordingly, I set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Chilaw dated 18.07.2017 and send the case back to the High Court for

a fresh hearing on merits.

Therefore, this appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this order to the

High Court of Chilaw.
