Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The main relief sought by the Petitioners in this application is a remedy by way of a writ

of Prohibition restraining the Minister of Justice (1st Respondent) from framing

regulations in terms of the Judicature Act to relocate the Matara Courts Complex to

Kotawila. The Petitioners assert that the Matara Courts Complex which is currently

within the Matara Fort will be relocated as per the Notice, marked P19, to the newly

built Courts Complex at Kotawila, Matara (New Complex).

At the outset, I need to draw my attention to the letter dated 15.12.2020 (P18) addressed

to the then Minister of Justice by the Matara Law Society (MLS). I observe that MLS

has raised their concerns in respect of the shifting of the existing court premises and

summarizing the whole issue the MLS has proposed the following points therein to

Page 3 of 8

mitigate the alleged destruction that could be caused due to the shifting of the Courts

Complex;

A. We propose that a common time table should be laid out for the moving of the courts to

Kotawila and construction of the Lawyers Office Complex.

B. All the court houses should be moved together. The proposed piecemeal basis of moving would

cause great inconvenience to litigants as well as the Attorneys. As you are well aware, lawyers

who are practicing in original Courts are the same who practice in higher Courts and that

will cause immense hardships to lawyers as well as to litigants.

C. We have come to know that now there is a proposal for the Government to give the building

of the Lawyers offices to some agency from whom the lawyers will be able to rent the office

spaces. We would like some assurance about the rent which could be charged by such agency

which could bearable especially by junior lawyers.

D. All of the issues listed above must be addressed adequately before moving of the court houses.

When the Petitioners filed the instant Application in the month of December 2022, apart

from the legal submissions, their main concern was the issue on the Lawyers Office

Complex which is well described in the above paragraph (C) in P18. Other than the

Resolution, the Constitution of the MLS, Report of the Surveyor, and Town plan etc.,

almost all the other documents annexed to the Petition are to illustrate the issues on

constructing a Lawyers Office Complex close to the said New Complex. It appears that

the MLS has initially taken endeavors to get a Lawyers Complex built with the assistance

of the Urban Development Authority adjacent to the New Complex and thereafter has

entered into a Memorandum of Understanding also with the Pradeshiya Sabha of

Weligama. As per the submissions made on behalf of the Petitioners, the MLS has not

received the expected support from the relevant Pradeshiya Sabha. It is very much clear

that the Government is not bound to construct office complexes for lawyers when shifting

or building court houses. However, it appears that the lawyers usually get the fullest

support and the corporation of the relevant Ministries when putting up lawyers office

complexes.

The question which arises here is whether the obstacles faced by the members of the MLS

can be considered as a ground for judicial review, particularly to grant a writ of Prohibition

as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition of the Petitioners. In view of the averments of

the Petition, Maha Matara Project has been initiated in the year 2010 and shifting the

Page 4 of 8

existing Matara Courts Complex is also one of the main proposals under the said project.

The MLS has prepared a construction plan for a Lawyers Office Complex in Kotawila

near the New Complex in the year 2017. Already five years have lapsed since then and

during such period the MLS has not made any objections for issuing a Regulation by the

Minister of Justice under Section 5(3) of the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978 (Act) until the

time the Petitioners filed the instant Application in December 2022.

Anyhow, the Petitioners complain that the garbage disposal site which is closer to the New

Complex lets out a foul odour throughout the day and night and it causes a great risk to

hygiene and sanitization of courts staff, lawyers and litigants. When this Court inquired

from the learned Counsel who appeared for both the Petitioners and the Respondents, it

emerged that the said garbage disposal site has been there from the time of commencement

of construction of the New Complex.

The Review Courts which usually grant discretionary remedies tend to refuse applications

based on futility, laches, un-meritoriousness, lack of promptitude etc. The cardinal

principle is that the person who seeks judicial review should explain laches, if any, by

establishing the facts as to why he is not negligent for long and unreasonable delay. There

is no evidence tendered to Court to the effect that the MLS has raised their objections

against the New Complex at the time of construction or even at the time of ceremonial

opening of the building by the then Minister. This Court is aware of the difficulties the

lawyers would undergo when their regular offices are not within the close proximity to a

Court Complex situated out of Colombo. However, this Court is unable to undermine the

fundamental principles in issuing a writ by only considering particular hardship that may

be faced by certain members of the MLS which cannot be assumed as an appropriate

ground to seek for a writ of Prohibition.

Moreover, it is necessary to examine whether the aforesaid garbage disposal site is a

serious legal ground to prevent the 1st Respondent exercising his powers under Section 5(3)

of the said Act. To my mind, a reasonable query raises as to how it would amount to

unlawfulness, illegality or unreasonableness when the relevant Minister issues a

Regulation under the said Section 5(3) in respect of the New Complex.

Page 5 of 8

The Petitioners legal submissions are based on the provisions of Section 5(3) of the said

Act. The Section 5(3);

Each court referred to in subsection (1) may be held at such convenient place or

places within such judicial district or division, as the case may be, as the Minister

shall by regulation from time to time appoint:

Provided that nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict or curtail the

power possessed by every Judge to hold court at any convenient place within his

territorial jurisdiction.

The contention of the Petitioners is that the 1st Respondent Minister should not promulgate

a Regulation appointing Kotawila New Complex as the place of hearing for the courts of

Matara and such assertion is made on the ground that the said location is not a

convenient place. The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners heavily relies on

the word convenient place embodied in the said Section 5(3).

A. R. B. Amarasinghe J. has extensively discussed on the Place of hearing of Courts in

his renowned book - Judicial Conduct, Ethics and Responsibilities, Wishwaleka (2002)

(pp.793 to 803). He has observed that though the Minister has the power to appoint, time

to time by Regulation under the relevant section of the Judicature Act, a convenient place

for hearing of Courts1, nothing in that Section shall be construed to restrict or curtail the

power possessed by every judge to hold Court at any convenient place within the judges

territorial jurisdiction. Amarasinghe J. has referred, inter alia, to

Kulantaivelpillai vs. Marikar 20 NLR 471 (at p. 475), where Bertram C.J. has held;

.He referred to the definition of " Court " as given in the Courts Ordinance. " Court " is

defined in the Courts Ordinance as being " a Judge empowered by law to act judicially alone,

or a body of Judges empowered by law to act judicially as a body, when such Judge or body

of Judges is acting judicially." That definition seemed to Withers J. and Bonser C.J. to imply

that a Judge is only acting judicially when he is sitting in Court. Personally, I do not so read

the words in that sense. The definition does not say " in any place in which such Judge or

1 which are mentioned in Section 5(1). The Section 5(1); There shall be in such judicial district of Sri Lanka

a "District Court" and in every judicial division there shall be a "Small Claims Court" and "Magistrates'

Court" and each such court shall be holden by and before one person to be called the "District Judge", "Judge

of the Small Claims Court" and "Magistrate" respectively.

Page 6 of 8

body of Judges is empowered to act judicially," but when, i.e., on any occasion on which such

Judge or body of Judges is acting judicially. The question whether a Judge is acting judicially-

as I understand the matter-is not to be determined by the building or place in which he sits,

but by the capacity in which he purports to act.

Amarasinghe J. has illustrated several judgements where the relevant judges have taken

decisions sitting at their chambers; judges residence and at the crime scene based on

several circumstances. An examination of case law shows that the interpretation of the

words convenient place has not been extended to an instance where the State as a policy

decision/administrative decision has decided to relocate the buildings of courts to another

location. On a careful perusal of such judicial precedent and the effect of Section 5(3), it

implies that every judge is possessed with the power to hold Court at any convenient place

within his territorial jurisdiction on special circumstances on temporary basis and that

power cannot be exercised to change the place of the building which constitutes Court

rooms decided by the relevant Minister by way of a Regulation. It comes to my mind in

the year 1998 when the terrorists attacked the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy, the District

Judge started hearing cases at his official residence as none of the court rooms were in a

suitable condition to hold court proceedings due to severe damages caused to the court

buildings. Thus, I take the view that the interpretation of the word convenient embodied

in the said Section 5(3) should not be enlarged beyond such special circumstances. I am

not discussing here about the Constitutional provisions relevant to the sittings of Courts.

As opposed to the arguments of the Petitioners, the learned Additional Solicitor General

(ASG) who appeared for the Respondents contended that the provisions of the proviso

to Section 5(3) can be read as a stand-alone Section. In support of his argument, the learned

ASG brought to the attention of this Court the letter written by the Hon. High Court Judge

of Matara, marked X (annexed to the motion dated 12.12.2022), by which he attempted

to express consensuses among the learned judges of Matara to shift the existing Court

premises to the said New Complex. He submits that the relocation of the court premises

can be done even only with such consensuses of judges in terms of the proviso to the said

Section 5(3). I simply cannot agree with the assertions of the learned ASG as the judges

cannot possess an unfettered discretion under the proviso to Section 5(3) to change or

relocate the building allocated for court rooms by the relevant Ministry. Anyhow, the

Page 7 of 8

judges have the discretion under the said proviso to change the place of hearing on

temporary basis under special circumstances as discussed above.

I take the view that the provisions of the sections with provisos should not be interpreted

as if they were parallel enactments. Such provisos should be considered as limitations on

the manifestation of the main section but should not go against the scheme of the whole

enactment. In Ismalebbe vs. Jayawardane, Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services (1990)

2 Sri. L.R. 199 (CA), S.N. Silva J. held that the proviso should be construed in relation to

the entire section and where necessary in the context of even the other sections. (Also see:

Jayagoda vs. Attorney General (2006) 2 Sri. L.R. 387 (CA); Salgado vs. Moses 1980 2 Sri. L.R.

6 (CA)). The Supreme Court of India in Shimbhu and another vs. State of Haryana (decided

on 27.08.2013), held that a proviso should be construed in relation to the main provision.

In Union of India and others vs. Dileep Kumar Singh (decided on 26.02.2015), it has been held

that though a proviso does not travel beyond the provision to which it is appended, golden

rule is to read the whole section, inclusive of the proviso in such manner that they mutually

throw light on each other and result in a harmonious construction.

In light of my above findings, I am not inclined to agree upon the definition on the words

convenient place formulated even by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners

as I see no substantive ground in this case to consider the lawyers convenience in

relocating the court premises. This is merely because the only main relief sought by the

Petitioners is for a writ of Prohibition restraining the 1st Respondent from framing

Regulations to relocate the existing Courts Complex to the New Complex at Kotawila.

Thus, the instant Application of the Petitioners is presumably pre matured and thus, if the

Minister promulgates a Regulation under Section 5(3), the Petitioners may gain a right to

get such decision reviewed on appropriate grounds, if any.

I cannot gather any reason, at this stage, to restrain the relevant Ministers power under

Section 5(3) as the decision to shift the Matara Court premises has not been taken

overnight but taken after much deliberations with the lawyers/judges over several years.

As the learned ASG pointed out the Auditor General has raised several concerns over the

issue of not occupying the New Complex after expending millions of Rupees of public

funds. Based on the special circumstances of this case, the non-removal of the aforesaid

garbage disposal site cannot be considered as a prime reason, at this stage, to justify further

postponement of the commencement of occupation of the New Complex. It is a

Page 8 of 8

mandatory duty of the relevant Local Government institutions to find a solution to the

relevant garbage issue expeditiously. It seems that the New Complex has been abandoned

several months after completion of its construction and the concerns of the Auditor

General need to be taken into serious consideration at this juncture of the country as more

and more deterioration of the condition of the building would be an unnecessary and

heavy expenditure to public funds.

In the circumstances, based on the arguability principles that should be adopted in respect

of matters relating to issuance of notice in a judicial review application, I hold that there

is no appropriate or additional question to be decided at a fuller hearing of this case which

warrants this Court to issue formal notice on the Respondents of this Application.

Application is refused.
