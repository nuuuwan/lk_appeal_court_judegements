Acquiring ownership of the enterprise is the express requirement and no percentage of shareholding is prescribed. As I have already stated above in this judgment, by amendment Act No. 12 of 2004, the Legislature removed the term partner or a joint venturer from the existing definition of the term acquires and added it to clause (ii), leaving acquiring ownership of the enterprise as an owner in clause (i). The issue of ownership percentage arises when acquiring ownership of an enterprise as a partner or joint venture partner. Therefore, in my view, clause (i) applies to a single shareholder company.",

Yet, all that Section 21 E provides is that the rehabilitation of the enterprise has to be done subject to the terms approved by the Ministry and not that the Ministry of Finance has to decide on the availability of the income tax exemption. Therefore, in my view, the Ministry of Finance may have confirmed that the rehabilitation has been done according to the approved terms enabling the party being entitled to claim the exemption but, the decision on the entitlement under the IR Act is a matter to be decided by the Inland Revenue Department.",
