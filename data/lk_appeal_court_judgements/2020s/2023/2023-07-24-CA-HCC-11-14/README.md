The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted in the

High Court of Ampara on the following count;

That on or between the 1st of August 2005 and the 5th of September 2005, by

producing, fraudulently or dishonestly, knowingly or has a reason to believe to be a forged

document which is bearing No. 1012 to one Giripura Senerath Palihawadanage, Upali

Abahayathilake who was the manager in the Peoples Bank in Ampara, thus committing

an offence punishable under the terms of Section 459 of the Penal Code.

Prosecution led the witnesses of PW1, PW2, PW5, PW6, PW7, PW9, PW10 and

PW11 and closed its case wherein marked productions from P1 to P13. The Accused also

gave evidence. Both the Prosecution and the Defense made submissions. The learned

Trial Judge by his judgement dated 18th of February 2014 convicted the Accused on the

indictment and sentenced the Accused to a term of 5 years RI and a fine of Rs.25000/-.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence the Accused had preferred an

appeal to this court and submitted the following grounds of appeal.

Page 3 of 7

a. That the learned trial judge has failed to determine that the PW3 namely

Puwapilleyi Thawamani is an instrumental witness in proving the innocence of

the Appellants;

b. That the learned trial judge has not considered the version of the defense at all

times;

c. In any event, the sentence imposed on the appellant is excessive.

Before we analyse the evidence led at the trial it is pertinent to refer to the relevant

section which describes the Using as genuine a forged document.

Section 459 of the Penal Code:

Whoever fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine any document which he knows

or has reason to believe to be a forged document shall be punished in the same manner as

if he had forged such document.

Withers J in the case of The Queen v Kapurala 2 NLR 330, has described what are

the elements to be proved in such a situation:

" A person is said to make a false document " who dishonestly or fraudulently

makes, signs, seals, or executes " a document or part of a document, or makes any mark

denoting the execution of a document, with the intention of causing it to be believed that

such document or part of a document was made, signed, sealed, or executed by or by the

authority of a person by whom or by whose " authority he knows that it was not made,

signed, sealed, "or executed, or at a time at which he knows that it was "not made, signed,

sealed, or executed."

(emphasis added)

With the above proposition in our mind, we have to consider whether the Prosecution

had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.

The facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that:

According to PW1 Upali Abahayathilake the Manager of Peoples Bank Ampara,

stated that the Accused had obtained a loan after submitting the allegedly forged

document, evidence document marked as P1 according to the prosecution.

Page 4 of 7

According to the evidence of PW1, he explained that this document Marked as P1

Financial Regulations No. 238(5) acts as a guarantee that monthly installment will be

bank by the Accounts Department.

P1, the form consists of two copies which have to be duly filled by the relevant

officials after placing the signature and rubber stamp seal of the Authorized officer which

in the instant case is PW2 of the Accounting Department of the Police, as one copy has to

be retained by them whereas the other copy is sent to the Bank, undertaking to send the

deducted amount from the salary to the Bank.

However, in the instant case, Prosecution alleged that this document marked as P1 had

not been duly completed by PW2.

After some time, it had come to their attention that the monthly installments were

not sent to the Bank by the Authority in Concern. PW1 inquired about it with PW2 the

Accountant. It was later revealed that the document marked as P1 was not signed by

PW2, thereafter he had made a complaint to the police.

According to PW2 Arunavelam Ravindran who was the Accountant of the Police

Department, he states that PW1 had contacted PW2 regarding the failure to send the

monthly installments for the loan obtained by the Accused. Upon further scrutiny, PW2

discovered that there had been no such undertaking given by the Authority in Concern to

the Bank that is to say that P1 was not issued by them. It is clearly revealed after seeing

the photocopy, PW2 realized that it was not his signature nor his seal that was found on

P1. PW2 goes on to deny that it was his signature and his seal that is found on P1 for the

undertaking of a deduction of 40% from the Accuseds salary.

PW2 admitted that whichever document is received must go through the Chief Clerk of

the Superintendents office which is PW3 namely Puwapilleyi Thawamani, who places the

date stamp and a short signature and sends it to the accounting department. It is evident

that the date stamp had been placed dated 26th of August 2005.

In the cross examination PW2 was shown the evidence document marked P4 by the

counsel, PW2 states that this document was prepared by the subject officer and signed by

the Chief Clerk.

Through this evidence, this court can form the opinion that this application had

been submitted to his PW2s office, which had been duly acknowledged with a date stamp

placed by PW3.

The Accused has given evidence from the evidence box. He indicated that after

handing over the document marked as P1 to PW3 the Chief Clerk who was not called by

the prosecution although she was named as a witness, had placed the date stamp and

handed it over to the neighbouring officer. He had inquired from the officer whom we come

to know as Devadasan when he will receive the completed form, Devadasan stated that

he will receive it in 5 days.

Upon receiving the form, it was signed and sealed accordingly and he then handed

it over to the bank.

However, it is vital to note that he states that he did not see who signed nor

prepared the document.

When we consider the evidence of the Accused, he firmly states that he did indeed

hand the form over to the Chief Clerk, it is pertinent to note that the Learned Trial Judge

had failed to consider this piece of evidence.

The learned High Court judge has misdirected himself by shifting the burden to the

Accused.

The burden of proof is always on the prosecution, this proposition was expressed in

Pantis v. The Attorney General 1998 2 SLR 148, his Lordship Wijeyaratne J held:

The burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove all ingredients of the

charge beyond reasonable doubt and there is no burden in our law for the accused to give

any explanation (unless in certain cases where specific provision is made by law). In my

view it is sufficient if the accused gives an explanation which satisfies the court or at least

is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.

It should be kept in mind that the trial Judge was a trained judge who would have

been aware of the fact that the burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove a

case beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore if a reasonable doubt was created in his mind,

no doubt he would have given the benefit of that doubt to the accused and acquitted him

on the charges.

In the instant case, the Accused has stated that he has handed the document over

to PW3, and also there is evidence to show that the said document had a date stamp,

however, this factor was not considered by the learned High Court Judge.

We are mindful that there is no need for the Accused to prove his innocence. For

the Accused to offer his evidence, only when a prima facie case has been made out by the

prosecution. This was expressed by Abbott, J. in Rex v. Burdett 1820 4 B & Ald 95, 120:

No person is to be required to explain or contradict until enough has been proved

to warrant a reasonable and just conclusion against him, in the absence of explanation or

contradiction; but when such proof has been given, and the nature of the case is such as

to admit of explanation or contradiction can human reason do otherwise than adopt the

conclusion to which proof tends."

The above dictum was followed by His Lordship P.R.P.Perera,J in the case

of Baddewithana v. The Attorney General 1990 1 SLR 275.

Page 7 of 7

With the above authority in mind, we are of the opinion that the most vital

witness is said to be the person who received the document that is PW3 namely

Puwapilleyi Thawamani. However, for some reason, the prosecution had not called

her to provide her evidence. This lapse on the part of the prosecution has to be

considered in light of the evidence provided by the Accused who has testified to

affect that he had handed the document out to PW3. This in fact has been

acknowledged by PW2 that there was a date stamp on the document marked P1.

Hence it is of our opinion, we can assess that the prosecution had failed

to prove that the Accused had forged the document or whether he had any

knowledge that it was not the signature of PW2 found in the document.

I am therefore of the opinion that in the absence of any item of evidence

pertaining to the purpose of proving that the Accused himself made the forged

document or whether he knew that the signature found on the document was

forged. It would be unsafe to permit the conviction of the Accused on the charge

of Section 459 of the Penal Code to stand.

Therefore, this court sets aside the conviction and the sentences imposed

in this case and acquit the Accused. The Appeal is allowed.
