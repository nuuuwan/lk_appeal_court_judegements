The Accused-Appellant abovenamed (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was

indicted before the High Court of Monaragala for having committed the following offence:

Count 1 On or about the 20th of June 1993, the Accused committed the murder of one Nalin

Priyadharshana, punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

Count 2 On the same day, at the same place, and in the course of the same transaction, the

Accused voluntarily caused grievous hurt by a dangerous weapon, namely a pole, to one

Gunathilaka Siriwardena Ramwalage Sudu Menike, punishable under Section 317 of the

Penal Code.

Count 3 On the same day, at the same place, and in the course of the same transaction, the

Accused voluntarily caused hurt to one Weerasuriya Muhandiramlage Ramani, punishable

under Section 317 of the Penal Code.

The Prosecution led the evidence of eleven witnesses and marked evidence as P1 to P7. The

Accused made a dock statement. After the trial before a jury, the Accused was convicted on

Page 3 of 8

all three counts on a unanimous verdict of the jury and thereafter sentenced by the Learned

High Court Judge on the 19th of February 2020, which are as follows:

Count 1 - Death sentence. Count 2 - Five years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of 20,000

LKR. Count 3 - One year of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of 1,000 LKR.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence the Accused has appealed to

this court.

The following grounds of appeal were set out in the written submission.

1. That a purported discussion between two juniors and the certain members of the court

staff is alleged to have taken place near the office of the Registrar of the High Court

after court proceedings had concluded on 13.02.2020, and the learned High Court

Judge erred in failing to discharge the Jury on the grounds that the Jury has violated

the oath taken at the conclusion of proceedings daily.

2. That the learned High Court Judge erred in law and misdirected the Jury on the

evidentiary value of the evidence of Mutuma Duralage Geethani Manel (PW3).

3. That the learned High Court Judge failed to analyse and thereby misdirected the Jury

on the evidentiary value of the evidence of weerasuriya Muhansiramlage Ramani

(PW2), which was duly adopted under Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance.

4. That the learned High Court Judge failed to direct the Jury on the importance of the

documents marked on behalf of the Appellant in his defence case.

5. That the learned High court Judge failed to appreciate the weight of the contradictions

and omissions marked and brought to the notice of court, and thereby misdirected the

Jury on giving the Appellant the benefit of any doubt.

Page 4 of 8

6. That the learned High Court Judge failed to direct the jury on the evidentiary value

of the purported hearsay evidence of Weerasuriya Muhandiramlage

Wimalawathi(PW4)

7. That the Learned High Court Judge failed to direct the Jury on the defence case and

importance of the defence witnesses led on the Accused.

The Facts and circumstances are that;

It should be noted that the Accused was first indicted in 2008 for the same matter, and he

was convicted on all three counts on the 18th of March 2014. Against the conviction, an appeal

was preferred to the Court of Appeal, bearing case No. CA/146/2014. The matter was sent for

retrial by order dated 14th June 2018, as it was observed that the jury option was not given

to the Accused. Therefore, a retrial commenced on the 10th of February 2020, and the same

witnesses who testified about 12 years ago gave evidence.

The evidence of the prosecution is as follows: On the fatal day of 20th June 1993, PW1 Sudu

Menika (the mother of the Deceased and an eyewitness who had sustained injuries during

the incident) was residing in her house with her two daughters, namely Weerasooriya

Muhandiramlage Ramani (PW2, who was an eyewitness who had also suffered injuries),

Weerasooriya Muhandiramlage Wimalawathie (PW4), and her son Nalin Priyadharshana

(the Deceased).

The Accused, who was a relative, had whispered a proposition to PW2, who was 15 years of

age at that time. Subsequently, PW2 rejected the Accuseds proposition, who then left the

premises and returned with a large pole hidden behind his back, which was witnessed by

Geetha Manel (PW3), who was also present at that time. The Accused struck PW2 with the

pole, flinging her to the ground. PW1 tried to intervene to save her daughter and was also

struck on the head by the Accused. PW1s son, who witnessed this, jumped around his

mothers neck in an attempt to protect her too, and was struck in the head by the Accused.

Subsequently, the Deceased fell to the ground and was struck in the head repeatedly.

Thereafter, the Accused left the scene. The entire process was witnessed by PW3, who was

hidden. PW1 and PW2 were taken to the hospital. PW1 had suffered grievous injuries to the

head with a fractured skull, and PW2 suffered non-grievous injuries to her head, as per the

medical report. Upon admission to the hospital, the Deceased was pronounced dead at 12:25

pm, approximately one hour after the incident. The cause of death was reported in the

postmortem report to be brain damage with a fractured skull following the assault to the

head with a blunt weapon.

During the trial, the defense marked six contradictions and highlighted two omissions. We

are mindful that these lay witnesses are giving evidence after 18 years.

We are mindful of the observation made by His Lordship Thakkar J. in Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai

V. State of Gujarat AIR 1983 SC 753;

By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photo graphic memory and to recall

the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape is replayed on the mental screen.

The Learned High Court Judge considered this contradiction and indicated to the jury that

none of the contradictions go to the root of the case.

The Accused takes up the defense of insanity, asserting that he committed the act by reason

of unsoundness of mind and was incapable of knowing the nature or consequence of his

action.

To prove that he was of unsound mind at the time of the act, on behalf of the Accused, one

Doctor Deelip Kumara gave evidence. He had examined the Accused on the 24th of February

2001, nearly eight years after the incident. According to him, he made an observation based

solely on information provided by the Accuseds wife. He further testified that he did not

examine the Accused during the time of the incident in 1993, and therefore, he cannot express

any opinion on what his mental status would have been at the time of the incident.

Page 6 of 8

He further testified that when he examined the Accused on 24th February 2001 the Accused

had no signs of mental illness. We are mindful that the observation made by His Lordship in

Ranjith Silva J, in the case of Nandaseena v Attorney General 2007, 1 S.L.R 237 at page 239,

held that;

When a defence of insanity is taken under section 77 of the Penal Code there must be

evidence to prove that the accused was insane, and this fact had to be proved on a balance of

probability like in a civil case. It is the burden of the accused to prove that he was incapable

of (1) knowing the nature of the act,(2) that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to

law. In the book titled "Law of Crimes" by Ratnalal and Thakore it is stated thus, 'It is only

unsoundness of mind which materially impairs the cognitive faculties of the mind that can

form a ground of exemption from criminal responsibility, the nature and the extent of

unsoundness of mind required being such as would make the offender incapable of knowing

the nature of the act or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law.

The Learned High Court Judge correctly considered the evidence of this witness and directed

the jury that there was no evidence to establish that the Accused had any mental illness.

The Learned High Court Judge has made the following observation on this regard and

directed the jury about this evidence.

Therefore, we hold that the Learned High Court has correctly informed the jury about the

law and the facts. On the other hand, witnesses for the prosecution have elicited in their

evidence that the Accused left the house in which the incident occurred after the refusal of

his proposition by PW2 and came back shortly with a pole hidden behind his back. This

clearly shows that the Accused had the power of rational thought before he executed his pre-

planned assault, which establishes him as capable of understanding the nature of his action.

I am of the view that the Accused has failed to prove, on a balance of probability, that

he was of unsound mind at the time of the act, and that he was incapable of knowing

the nature of the act.

We found that there is no misdirection or non-direction by the Learned High Court Judge

causing any miscarriage of justice. We affirm the conviction by the unanimous verdict of the

jury and the sentence imposed by the Learned High Court Judge dated 19th of February 2020,

therefore we dismiss the appeal.
