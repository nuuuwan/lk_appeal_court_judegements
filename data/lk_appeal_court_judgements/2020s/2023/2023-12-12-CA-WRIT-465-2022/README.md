The Director (Legal and Enforcement) of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri

Lanka (SEC), by way of a Notice of Action dated 05.09.2022 (P10) informed the 2nd

Petitioner that the members of the SEC had made a direction to take steps to initiate legal

proceedings against the 2nd Petitioner for alleged market manipulation. The P10 further

elaborates that Rule 12 of the SEC Rules forbids such market manipulation and the decision

to institute legal proceedings was taken after due consideration of how the 2nd Petitioner

traded on behalf of the 1st Petitioner, concerning the shares of Browns Investments PLC

(BIL) between the period of 08.12.2020 to 04.01.2021. The 1st Petitioner is the holding

company of several subsidiaries including the Capital Trust Securities Pvt. Limited which is

a stock brokerage firm. The said P10 discloses that the SEC has requested the Attorney

General to initiate legal proceedings against the 2nd Petitioner. The SEC by a letter dated

26.10.2022 marked P17 has reiterated its decision to institute criminal proceedings against

Page 3 of 12

the 2nd Petitioner. The Petitioner primarily challenges the decisions reflected in both the above

P10 and P17.

The SEC Rules which have been published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 1215/2 on

18.12.2001 are marked as P4. Both parties unmistakably rely on the said P4. The Rule 12

of the SEC Rules reads:

No person shall create, cause to be created or do anything that is calculated to create

a false or misleading appearance or impression of active trading, or a false or

misleading appearance or impression with respect to the market for or the price of any

securities listed in a licensed stock exchange.

Surveillance was done by the Colombo Stock Exchange(CSE) and the SEC into the trading

activity of shares of BIL during the period 01.12.2020 to 12.01.2021. As a consequence of the

said examination, it was revealed that, during the said period, the trading pattern engaged by

the 2nd Petitioner and connected parties of BIL created a false sense of activity around the said

stock and influenced its price. The SEC has demanded the 2nd Petitioner to show cause by a

letter marked P3. It is stated that the 2nd Petitioner's conduct spelled out in P3, allegedly

created a false market for the respective security in contravention of Rules Nos. 12 and/or 13

of the said SEC Rules. The SEC, again by way of a letter marked P8 has requested the 2nd

Petitioner to show cause in respect of several accounts related to the Capital Trust Group

(CTG) which supposedly have traded significantly in the shares of BIL wherein certain

abnormalities had been detected on trading in some identified Accounts. The 2nd Petitioner

has responded to the both above show cause letters by P7 (dated 27.01. 2021) and P9 (dated

05.10.2021).

In terms of section 147 of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka Act, No. 19

of 2021, (Act) a person who contravenes its sections 128, 129, 130, 131, 132 or subsections

(2) and (3) of section 137 commits an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not

less than ten million rupees or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or to both

such fine and imprisonment. Further, any person who abets or conspires to commit an offence

under subsection (1), commits an offence and shall be punishable in the same manner as

provided for in subsection (1).

Page 4 of 12

By virtue of section 148 and section 149 of the Act, every offence committed under Chapter

II shall be triable upon indictment by the High Court and every prosecution in respect of such

an offence shall be instituted and conducted by the Attorney General. The said Act was

certified on 21.09.2021. By the said Act the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri

Lanka Act No.36 of 1987 was repealed. The mode of prosecution prescribed in the said Act

No.36 of 1987, in respect of any person who is found guilty of an offence under the previous

Act (for which no penalty is expressly provided for under the said Act) by way of a summary

trial by a Magistrate. Anyhow, the duty of prosecution of offences under the current Act is

bestowed on the Attorney General. Section 187(2) (k) of the current Act stipulates that all

offences under the provisions of the repealed Act, shall be offences committed under the said

repealed Act and be tried accordingly. It is observed as per the letter of the Attorney General

marked R5 that the SEC has sought legal assistance from the Attorney General to institute

criminal proceedings and that was after certifying the said Act No.19 of 2021.

The Attorney General possesses a wide range of powers in respect of prosecutions under the

law and some of such powers are described in section 393 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act No.15 of 1979 (CCPA). In addition to presenting an indictment to the High Court, the

Attorney General also enjoys exclusive powers when entering a nolle prosequi, withdrawing an

indictment or suspending prosecutions. Section 193 of the CCPA stipulates that in every trial

before the High Court, the prosecution shall be conducted by the Attorney General. In cases

where a magistrate is required to hold a preliminary inquiry under section 145 or section

136(e) of the CCPA, the Magistrate, if he is satisfied with the sufficient evidence commits the

accused to stand trial in the High Court and forwards to the Attorney General a copy of the

proceedings, together with other relevant documents.

Therefore, the Attorney General will initiate criminal proceedings only if he is independently

satisfied with the sufficiency of evidence and also based on the provisions of the CCPA. In

this backdrop, it cannot be assumed that the Attorney General must follow a mere request of

the SEC to file an indictment under section 148 of the aforementioned Act or to initiate any

criminal proceedings against the 2nd Respondent without the Attorney General arriving at an

independent finding upon the alleged offences.

Page 5 of 12

However, for reasons not known to this Court, the Attorney General represents the SEC in

the instant Application. It is noted that this Application for Judicial Review deals not with

any delictual offence relating to damages but directly with framing criminal charges against

the 2nd Petitioner. Anyhow, I do not doubt that the Attorney General is privileged to defend

himself independently, if he wishes, in the instant Application. The Attorney General has

indeed expressed his opinion by R5, that there is evidence to establish a prima facie case

against the 2nd Petitioner to charge him in the Magistrates Court.

Due to the above circumstances, I am compelled to assess whether substantial grounds exist

to frame charges against the 2nd Petitioner, without limiting my examination only to the

decision-making process of the SEC in view of the impugned decisions. Therefore, now I need

to advert to the principle facts and circumstances of this case. The SEC has primarily made

four observations against the 2nd Petitioner as reflected in the 2nd show cause letter marked

P8.

Such first observation is about the SECs point of view that it is irrational to have

commissioned another brokerage firm when the relevant trades could have been facilitated

via CTGs own brokerage firm and avoided cash flows to another broker. The contention of

the Petitioner in respect of the said alleged misconduct is that the trading rules of the CSE do

not prohibit an investor from executing trades through several stock broker firms and such

conduct cannot constitute a violation of Rule 12 of the SEC Rules.

The second observation made against the 2nd Petitioner is that he had executed nine

transactions which appeared to be Wash Trades between the CTG-related Accounts. It was

submitted that Wash Trades refer to trades where the buyer and the seller are both the same

person making it so that there is no change in beneficial ownership when shares change hands

between the seller and the buyer. The Petitioners assert that although the 'Wash Trades' are

expressly prohibited only under Rule 13 of the SEC Rules, the Notice of Action marked P10

indicated that the 2nd Petitioner would be subject to legal action for violation of its Rule 12.

The Petitioners further argue that the price of a share did not artificially increase or decrease

as a result of the said alleged nine Wash Trades. The Petitioners pointing to each transaction

Page 6 of 12

referred to in P211 demonstrates that the alleged 9th Wash Trade constitutes less than 4.88%

of the total quantity of BIL shares traded on 12.12.2020 whilst the other eight purported Wash

Trades constitute less than 2.05 of the total quantity of BIL shares traded on the relevant days.

Thus, the Petitioners contend that such transactions cannot be construed as a grave act of

market manipulation.

Likewise, the 2nd Petitioner asserts that the reason for his conduct which allegedly resulted in

raising the allegations of a 'Wash Trade' was due to receiving Margin Calls from his bank

and it was not an act done to manipulate the market. In contrast, the Respondents argue that

when the SEC contacted the relevant banks they had confirmed that no Margin Calls were

made at the time to the Petitioner. Thus, the Respondents emphasize that the Petitioners have

provided a false response to the second show cause letter. Further, the Respondents assert

that Wash Trade transactions bear a strong potential to distort the stock market as it indicates

a high value of trading concerning a particular stock when in actuality the ownership of the

shares remains with the same person.

It is significant to note that the Respondents acknowledge that these unusual activities did not

necessarily cause the sudden surge in the price of stocks and admit that it may have been

largely or wholly attributable to the corporate announcement by BIL of their affiliation with

a Port City Project. Nonetheless, the Respondents are of the view that these trading

operations are against the aforesaid Rule 12 because the 2nd Petitioner's activity was

calculated to distort the market. Be that as it may, the learned Presidents Counsel

appearing on behalf of the Petitioners, through strenuous argument, clarified that there has

been no significant increase in the value of the respective shares as an immediate aftermath

of the said nine transactions. Therefore, following a careful analysis of the document marked

P21, and based on the limited material available to this Court, I am unable to find any

compelling reason to refute the stand taken by the Petitioners that the aforesaid nine

transactions do not violate Rule 12 of the SEC Rules.

1 The 'P21', a document annexed to the Counter Affidavit of the 2nd Petitioner illustrates (i) transaction dates (ii)the time the respective transaction was taken place (iii) respective trade ID (iv) respective security code (v) respective price (vi) and quantity.

Page 7 of 12

The third and fourth observations of the SEC are predicated on the purported allegations that

the 2nd Petitioner has fabricated a demand and that there is an abnormal number of cell trades

that could have given the CTG an undue benefit. The Respondents have not adequately

answered to the proposition of the Petitioners that the third observation was in reference to

an act that had occurred on 19.01.2021 and it falls outside the show cause period specified in

the Notice of Action which raises demands only in respect of the period between 08.12.2020

to 04.01.2021. Similarly, I take the view that the Respondents have not submitted sufficient

material to Court to substantiate the move of the SEC to formulate a criminal charge against

the 2nd Petitioner based on the said fourth observation.

In a nutshell, the arguments of the Respondents is that a sudden surge in the share value of

the Company is unusual and that led the SEC to commence investigations which revealed

unusual trading activity amounting to the manipulation of the market or the price of the BIL

share. What is important to learn through the submissions made on behalf of the Respondents

is that the conduct of the 2nd Petitioner amounts to manipulation of the market in terms of

Rule 12, even if it did not per se contribute to the dramatic surge in the stock price. The

Respondents contend that the said dramatic appreciation of the share price of BIL was largely

the result of the corporate announcement regarding their affiliation with the Port City Project.

The Respondents further contend that the SEC's investigations demonstrated that the 2nd

Petitioner had in fact engaged in unlawful and irregular trading activity, even though the

Respondents acknowledge that this appreciation was not always the consequence of any

manipulative conduct on the part of the 2nd Petitioner. Moreover, the Respondents argued

that such trading activity constituted an act of manipulation of the stock market not

necessarily on the basis that it caused a distortion of the market but because it was

calculated to cause such a distortion.

Hence, the Respondents submit that the 2nd Petitioner's unusual trading actions, even if they

did not directly affect BIL's share price or the volume of shares purchased, violated the

aforementioned Rule 12. This is because Rule 12 prohibits a person from creating, causing to

be created or doing anything that is calculated to create a false or misleading appearance or

impression of active trading. Nonetheless, in these circumstances, it is important to consider

the fact that the 2nd Petitioner has provided detailed explanations to each of the two show

Page 8 of 12

cause letters through the subsequent two documents marked P7 and P9, where he has even

provided an explanation about some of the alleged unusual trading activities being a genuine

mistake on his part, which occurred due to the 2nd Petitioner placing a BUY order in place of

a SELL order.

In light of the above, it is difficult to arrive at a conclusion without substantial and stable

evidence as to whether the actions of the 2nd Petitioner were done in a calculated manner, as

required under Rule 12 to distort the stock market. As such, an additional issue arises in whose

favour the burden of proof would lie. This is because the Respondents assert that an attempt

at market manipulation has been made, especially when there is seemingly no clear impact

by the actions of the 2nd Petitioner on the price of the relevant shares.

Anyhow, the Respondents stand firm on their argument that causality between conduct and

outcome is not necessary for the 2nd Petitioner to violate the said Rule 12. This is further

emphasized by the learned Deputy Solicitor General drawing an analogy through his own

creative words as mentioned below:

Assume, one shoots a man at point-blank range with the intention to cause his death, but he

misses, and at the next moment, the intended victim is gunned down by a sniper acting

independently. Can the fact that the shooter's objective (of causing the mans death) was realized

through an external agency excuse the malevolent behavior? The answer of course is an emphatic

NO!

However, in the event that the 2nd Petitioner may have made a genuine mistake in carrying

out the trading activities, the respondent shall have an obligation to reinforce their stand by

presenting the Court with sufficient proof. The aforesaid analogy in fact helps me to come to

a clear understanding of the complexity of issues in this case which can only be resolved with

clear and consistent information. This is a key element to conclude that an accused party or

the 2nd Petitioner must know without any ambiguity the case against them to formulate their

defense effectively.

For the reasons explained above, the notion of 'right to know the opposing case' is crucial

when determining the questions of this case. Accordingly, at this stage, I need to draw my

attention to the submissions made on behalf of the 2nd Petitioner on the perspective of the

Page 9 of 12

violation of the Rule of Natural Justice stemming from the show cause letters issued against

the said 2nd Petitioner.

The Petitioners, referring to several communications between the SEC and the 2nd Petitioner,

contend that the SEC has failed to provide necessary clarifications as to the specifics of the

allegations against the Petitioners. For instance, the following paragraph in the letter marked

P7 (written in response to the first show cause letter P3) is highlighted:

You have not given any evidence or facts that even remotely suggest that I have had any direct

or indirect arrangement with connected parties of Browns Investments PLC. Without at least

some details of such persons and without you specifying the transactions which have created a

false sense of activity around the stock, it makes it impossible for me to provide you with "cause"

as to why action should not be instituted against me."

The Petitioners complain that, for over 9 months they have not received any response to the

letters marked P6 and P7. Instead of providing additional information, the SEC has served

the second show cause letter marked P8 against the 2nd Petitioner. By the letter marked P3,

the 2nd Petitioner was required to show cause as to why no action should be taken against him

for violation of Rule 12 and/or Rule 13 of the SEC Rules during the period 01.12.2020 to

12.01.2021 whereas in P8 the 2nd Petitioner is required to show cause for a period from

01.12.2020 to 15.01.2021. The Petitioners continue to maintain their stand even with the letter

marked P8 that the SEC has failed to provide adequate details of the purported transactions

in violation of the Rule of Natural Justice. The SECs failure to detail the eight purported

'Wash Trades' out of the nine stipulated in P8 is given as one occasion where the Rule of

Natural Justice has been violated by the SEC. In response to P8, the 2nd Petitioner has

submitted a detailed analysis in his reply letter marked P9 wherein he has reiterated, inter

alia, the inadequacy of information as follows:

"No references are made to transaction dates, times or details. It is therefore extremely unfair to

make such a vague and unsubstantiated allegation and to expect me to provide an explanation

without any specific indication of your concern, particularly given that I routinely transact several

thousands of trades."

Page 10 of 12

In light of the above, the crux of the argument of the Petitioners is that impugned Notices of

Action marked 'P10' and 'P17' have been issued without providing relevant

details/information pertaining to the alleged charges against the 2nd Petitioner and thereby

curtailing a proper and fair hearing to the Petitioners. Similarly, the Petitioners assert that the

decision of the SEC that an offence has been made out against the 2nd Petitioner and criminal

proceedings should be instituted accordingly was a mere predetermined fait accompli.

I take the view that this Court should be guided with the following words of Lord Denning

reflected in the Writ Remedies; Remediable Rights Under Public Law (by Justice B.P. Banerjee,

7th Edition, at page 1093) upon which the Petitioners have placed reliance:

One of the requirements of natural justice is that the objector should have the opportunity to

know and meet if the case made agaisnt him. Lord Denning in Kanda v. Government of Malaya,

(1962) AC 322 observed that if the right to be heard is to be a real right which is worth anything

it must carry with it a right in the accused man to know the case which is made against him. He

must know what evidence has been given and the statement has been made affecting him and

then he must have been given a fair opportunity to correct or contradict the same.

Now I need to elaborate further on the observation made by this Court in the case of Free

Trade Zone and General Services Employees Union (FTZGSEU) and Others v. B.K.P.

Chandrakeerthi, the Commissioner General of Labour and Others CA/WRIT/303/2022 decided

on 04.10.2023. which reads as follows:

if any litigant makes an allegation that a person who has been entrusted to conduct an inquiry

has not considered the relevant facts, he should at least outline to Court at the review stage about

such alleged facts that were ignored or disregarded by the respective inquiry officer. This is

because, Court finally decides a writ application on an overall consideration of the facts and law

relating to the questions before Court.

Stemming from the above dicta, I take the view that when evaluating a defense on the 'right

to know the opposing case', it is necessary to revisit the traditional approach taken by review

courts, which is highly technical in nature. The 'right to know the opposing case' can be

considered as an illustrated dimension under the Rules of Natural Justice. To my mind, the

Page 11 of 12

review court before making an order on such an aspersion/defense should deviate to a certain

extent from the customary process and assess whether the objector is in a position to establish

a sufficient defense at least during the review proceedings based on the fresh material provided

to Court by the opponent. This is due to the reason that if the opponent presented the

necessary details/information to Court during the review phase, satisfying the Rules of

Natural Justice, the Court would be empowered to utilize its inherent power to reach a fair

judgment concerning the objectors grievance. When considering the facts and circumstances

of this case, I am unable to deliver a fair determination focusing only on the material presented

to Court by the Respondents justifying the decision taken to initiate criminal proceedings

against the Petitioners.

On an overall consideration of the whole matter, I take the view that the 2nd Petitioner must

know the case against him without any suppression by the officials of the SEC. The Court

needs to give due effect to the norm 'right to know the opposing case', especially when the

final step is criminal prosecution2 against the suspected person. Thus, I am inclined to

conclude that the SEC has failed in its duty to disclose fully the allegations against the 2nd

Petitioner in the show cause letters (P3 & P8) and to enable him to show cause on charges

supported by clear and consistent information. Hence, I hold that the SEC has issued the said

Notices of Actions marked P10 and P17 violating the rights of the 2nd Petitioner to know

his case substantially and such failure of the SEC eventually amounts to a violation of the

Rule of Natural Justice. My such findings should not be a grand license for the 2nd Petitioner

or any brokerage firm to engage in market manipulation hiding behind a shield called no

evidence to evade the prosecution prescribed by the Act. It needs to be stressed that my above

conclusion is limited only to the unique circumstances of this case and there should not be

2 In this regard the Petitioner relies on the findings of B.P Aluwihare, PC, J. in the case of Ganeshan Samson Roy v. M.M. Janaka Marasinghe and Others S.C (F/R) 405/ 2018 decided on 20.09.2023 which states: "The decision to prosecute is a serious step that affects suspects, victims, witnesses and the public at large and must be undertaken with the utmost care. Many common law jurisdictions apply a two- stage test in deciding whether or not to initiate a prosecution; that is evidential sufficiency and the public interest. In assessing the sufficiency of evidence, the prosecutor should consider, the admissibility, the reliability and the credibility of the material. The evidence of the defence and any argument which might be put forth should be weighed before asking whether it is more likely than not a court would convict the accused. There must be a rigorous examination of the case to ensure that indictments are not made prematurely. Before indictments are filed, the Attorney General should consider if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the person to be indicted has committed the offence, or if further evidence can be obtained to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, or if the seriousness or the circumstances of the case justifies the making of an immediate decision to file indictments or if it is in the public interest to file indictments against the suspect."

the slightest hindrance to the statutory power of the SEC to give vibrant effect to the provisions

of the Act which encompasses a wide spectrum of laws governing the capital market.

In the circumstances, I proceed to issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari

quashing the Notice of Action dated 05.09.2021 marked P10 and the letter dated 26.10.2022

marked P17 as well as the decision to institute criminal proceedings against the 2nd Petitioner

as reflected in the said P10 and P17. I am not inclined to grant any other reliefs as prayed

for in the prayer of the Petition since I am satisfied that the above relief granted addresses the

Petitioners main grievance and this Court should not unnecessarily prevent the SEC from

taking action against the Petitioners in a lawful manner and according to the Principles of

Natural Justice.
