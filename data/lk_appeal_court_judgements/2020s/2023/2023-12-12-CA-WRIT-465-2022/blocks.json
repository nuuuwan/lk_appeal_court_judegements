Many common law jurisdictions apply a two- stage test in deciding whether or not to initiate a prosecution; that is evidential sufficiency and the public interest. In assessing the sufficiency of evidence, the prosecutor should consider, the admissibility, the reliability and the credibility of the material. The evidence of the defence and any argument which might be put forth should be weighed before asking whether it is more likely than not a court would convict the accused. There must be a rigorous examination of the case to ensure that indictments are not made prematurely. Before indictments are filed, the Attorney General should consider if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the person to be indicted has committed the offence, or if further evidence can be obtained to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, or if the seriousness or the circumstances of the case justifies the making of an immediate decision to file indictments or if it is in the public interest to file indictments against the suspect.\"",
