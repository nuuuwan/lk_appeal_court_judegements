MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeal has been filed to set aside the judgment dated 2.12.2015 of the

High Court of Nuwara-Eliya.

The two appellants had been indicted along with the dead accused for murder and

upon the conclusion of the trial the appellants had been convicted for the same

and had been sentenced to death.

The story of the prosecution is that the incident had taken place in an estate and

the deceased had been known for brewing illicit liquor and the two appellants and

the deceased accused had been in a campaign on the estate to stop the same and

the deceased had not been too happy about it.

On the day of the incident , around 5 pm in the evening ( there had been plenty of

light) two of the prosecution witnesses state that the deceased was cut by the

deceased accused and the appellants, and after the injuries had been caused the

appellants had shouted to say that anybody else also would be cut if they come

forward.

Page 3 of 6

The JMO had said that there had been 12 cut injuries but most of them have been

identified to be defensive injuries but he had said that more than one had

participated in causing the injuries and one of the said injuries had been identified

as being the cause of death.

On the statements of the appellants and the deceased accused the police had

recovered three knives.

The two appellants had made dock statements and they had spoken to about the

deceased being a person who had been involved in brewing illicit liquor had the

villagers had been angry with him and on the day of the incident they had seen

the deceased accused cutting the deceased and the defense witnesses called by

the appellants have reiterated the same position.

The Counsel appearing for the appellants stated as grounds of appeal that the trial

judge had not evaluated the defense case in the proper perspective and had in

fact laid an un due burden on the appellants.

But we observe that the trial judge had been mindful of the basic principle in

criminal law that the prosecution has to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt

and he had considered the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and had

concluded that their evidence was without any glaring contradictions and

omissions which creates a reasonable doubt in the case for the prosecution and

had considered the evidence of the defense and had concluded that the

prosecution had placed its case on cogent and acceptable evidence.

The trial judge had observed that the defense had been wavering in their position

in cross examination and the dock statements and had not been consistent.

A submission made by the Counsel for the appellants was that the two eye

witnesses of the prosecution had been contradicting each other but we observe

that the two eye witnesses had seen the incident at different stages of the

incident which does not mean that they have contradicted each other, and the

trial judge had very wisely analyzed the same in that spirit.

The Counsel appearing for the respondents had cited the case of Bhajinbai Hirijbai

vs. the State of Bujarat AIR 1983 SC 753 which is very much cited in our Courts and

which has been cited by the former Chief Justice Priyasad Dep in the case of

SC\TAB\2A-D/2017 and has cited the relevant portion in the Indian Judgment

which says that,

Overmuch importance cannot be attached to minor discrepancies. The reasons

are obvious:-

1. By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape is

replayed on the mental screen.

2. Ordinarily is so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The witness

could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element

of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to be

attuned to absorb the details.

3. The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one may

notice, another may not. An object or movement might emboss its image

on one persons mind, whereas it might go unnoticed on the part of

another.

4. By and large people cannot accurately recall a conversation and reproduce

the very words used by them or heard by them. They can only recall the

Page 5 of 6

main purport of the conversation. It is unrealistic to expect a witness to be

a human tape recorder.

5. In regards to exact time of an incident, or the time duration of an

occurrence, usually, people make their estimate by guess work on the spur

of the moment at the time of interrogation. And one cannot expect people

to make very precise or reliable estimate in such matters. Again, it depends

on the time sense of individuals which varies from person to person.

6. Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the sequence

of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short time span. A

witness is liable to get confused, or mixed up when interrogated later on.

7. A witness, though wholly truthful, is liable to be overawed by the court

atmosphere and the piercing cross examination made by counsel and out

of nervousness mix up facts, get confused regarding sequence of events, or

fill up details from imagination on the spur of the moment. The

subconscious mind of the witness sometimes so operates on account of the

fear of looking foolish or being disbelieved though the witness is giving a

truthful and honest account of the occurrence witnessed by him. Perhaps it

is a sort of a psychological defense mechanism activated on the spur of the

moment.

Discrepancies which do not go to root of the matter and shake the basic version of

the witnesses cannot be annexed with undue importance.

Furthermore, the Counsel for the appellants urged that the trial judge by stating in

his judgment that in weighing the evidence of the defense he finds that the

prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt had caused grave

prejudice to the appellants. But we do not see any merit in the said submission

and also we wish to state that it has not been laid down in law nor has it been

Page 6 of 6

decided in cases as to any specific style of judgment writing. It all depends on each

individual judges style of writing. But since of late as pointed out by the Counsel

for the respondents that the counsel seem to be objecting to certain formations of

phrases being used as being prejudicial to their clients. But we are of the view that

phrases and terminology cannot be considered in isolation but instead it has to be

considered in the backdrop of the facts of the individual case.

As such we are unable to agree with the grounds of appeal raised by the learned

counsel for the appellants; therefore we affirm the conviction and the sentence of

the trial judge and dismiss the instant appeal.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
