This is an application made by the petitioner seeking relief by way of Writs in

the nature of Mandamus and Prohibition pertaining to the declaration of the

petitioner as the legally nominated legal successor of license number

91/629/908 as per the petition dated 14.08.2018.

The facts of the case are as follows. The petitioner avers that the mother of the

petitioner originally nominated all three of her children (including the

petitioner, the 8th and the 9th respondents) as successors to the land affected

by the license bearing number 91/629/908 and then in the year 1995, she

changed her mind and made an amendment to the license nominating the

petitioner as the sole successor to the land affected by the license. The

petitioner further avers that the cancellation and the registration of a fresh

nomination has been carried out by the 1st respondent in the official

documents maintained at the 1st respondents office.

However, this position is contended by the 8th and the 9th respondents

claiming that the amendment made subsequent to the original nomination

has been made due to the intimidation to the mother by the petitioner and

therefore, such nomination is bereft of proper procedure and lacks the

intention of the mother to make such an amendment. The petitioner has come

before the court due to the decision made by the Land Commissioner of the

North Central Province on 23.02.2015, declaring that the purported

amendment has not been made in accordance with the proper procedure

promulgated by the law. The Land Commissioner consequent to such a

determination, has decided to divide the land among all the three children

according to the original nomination by the decision dated 07.11.2016.

Therefore in light of such a declaration, the petitioner by the petition dated

14.08.2018, sought a Writ of Mandamus to issue the license to the petitioner

on the ground of the petitioner being the sole successor to the license bearing

4

CA-WRT-269-18 Page 4 of 7 02/11/2023 IJ-33-23

number 91/629/608 and furthermore has sought a Writ of Prohibition to

prevent the sub division of the land affected by the license bearing number

91/629/608 among the petitioner, the 8th and the 9th respondents.

In addressing the major contention of the present application, this Court is of

the view that the amendment to the original nomination has not been made

in accordance with the procedure laid out by the law in the Land Development

Ordinance no.19 of 1935. The pertinent sections can be elaborated in the

following manner:

Section 54 of the Land Development Ordinance stipulates that:

The owner of a holding or permit holder may make a further nomination

in lieu of any nomination which has been cancelled; and a person may

be renominated as successor notwithstanding the previous cancellation

of the nomination of that person in such capacity.

As stipulated in the above section, in order to make a fresh nomination, the

original nomination has to be duly cancelled and in lieu of such cancellation

a further nomination can be made by the owner of a holding or a permit

holder.

The appropriate procedure to be followed while making such cancellation or

registration of a fresh nomination is provided under Section 56 of the Land

Development Ordinance where it is stipulated that:

The nomination of a successor and the cancellation of any such

nomination shall be effected by a document substantially in the

prescribed form executed and witnessed in triplicate before a

Government Agent, or a Registrar of Lands, or a divisional Assistant

Government Agent, or a notary, or a Justice of the Peace.

According to Section 56, a nomination or a cancellation of a nomination is

affected solely upon the execution of the procedure prescribed in the Land

Development Ordinance and adding further to the same, Section 58 of the

Land Development Ordinance stipulates that:

A document (Other than a last will) whereby the nomination of a

successor is effected or cancelled shall not be valid unless and until it

5

CA-WRT-269-18 Page 5 of 7 02/11/2023 IJ-33-23

has been registered by the Registrar of Lands of the district in which the

holding or land to which that document refers is situated.

In the instant application the petitioner averred that the mother has made an

amendment to the original nomination, however, it is evident as per the above

promulgated law, that in order for such amended nomination to be in

operation it is essential to be made in accordance with the proper procedure

laid in the Land Development Ordinance. Thereby as per Section 58 of the

Land Development Ordinance such an amendment needs to be registered by

the Registrar of Lands of the district in which the holding or land to which

that document refers is situated. In absence of the adherence to the

aforementioned procedure, a nomination is considered to be invalid.

In the instant application, the respondents averred that the amendment has

been made by striking off the names of the 8th and the 9th respondents from

the list of names in the original nomination and the petitioner has failed to

submit documents as proof of a lawful registration of the amended nomination

and the documents with regard to the cancellation of the original nomination.

Section 62 of the Land Development Ordinance further buttresses the above

point and states that in order for a fresh nomination to be registered, the

previous nomination has to be cancelled by the registration of a document of

cancellation. The petitioner in the instant application has not provided any

documents of cancellation registered in the Land Registry, nor has the

petitioner submitted a fresh nomination registered as per Section 58 of the

Land Development Ordinance. Therefore, it could be said that the purported

amendment has not been made in accordance with the procedure laid out in

the Land Development Ordinance.

In such an event, it is pertinent to shed light on Section 75 of the Land

Development Ordinance, which reads as follows:

Any nomination of a successor and any cancellation of any registered

nomination of a successor shall be wholly invalid if such nomination or

cancellation in any way contravenes the provisions of this Ordinance.

Accordingly, since the provisions of the Ordinance have not been followed, it

is the observation of this Court that the purported amendment has not been

made in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the law. Therefore, the

6

CA-WRT-269-18 Page 6 of 7 02/11/2023 IJ-33-23

lack of adherence to proper procedure is considered a contravention of the

Land Development Ordinance in terms of Section 75 of the Ordinance. Hence,

in the event of such contravention of the law, the purported nomination

amendment can be considered as invalid.

The learned counsel for the 8th and the 9th respondents quoted the

determination in CA Writ Application no.453/2013 decided on 10.10.2016

where his Lordship Justice P. Padman Surasena held that the nomination has

to be made in the prescribed form and be registered in the Land Registry in

terms of Section 58 of the Land Development Ordinance and if it is not

registered, such nomination is considered to be invalid. Therefore, it is the

observation of this Court that since the petitioner has failed to submit any

document with regard to the cancellation of the original nomination and any

document with regard to the fresh nomination, the purported amendment is

invalid.

The petitioner through his submissions stated that the respondents are only

now, questioning the validity of the thumb impression of the mother:

J. Magilin Nona but havent taken such defenses in the other legal forums

where they themselves contested the amendment to the legal nomination of

license bearing number 91/629/908, namely in the District Court of

Anuradhapura or the High Court of Anuradhapura where they contested the

same issue which lies before this Court.

The counsel for the 8th and 9th respondents through his submissions tendered

that the petitioner is guilty of laches. It is pointed out by the respondents that

though the petitioner comes before this court upon the decision taken by the

Commissioner General of Lands on 07.11.2016 to divide the land among the

petitioner and the 8th and 9th respondents, the dispute between these parties

dates back to 1998. Thus, the respondent claims that the petitioner has come

to court over 20 years after the dispute has arisen and claims this extreme

delay is fatal for the application.

In support of the above submissions the respondents have cited the case of

Issadeen v The Commissioner of National Housing and Others 2003 2

SLR Page 10 which states: It is however to be noted that delay could defeat

equity. Although there is no statutory provision in this country restricting the

time limit in filing an application for judicial review and the case law of this

7

CA-WRT-269-18 Page 7 of 7 02/11/2023 IJ-33-23

country is indicative of the inclination of the Court to be generous in finding 'a

good and a valid reason for allowing late applications, I am of the view that

there should be proper justification given in explaining the delay in filing such

belated applications. In fact, regarding the writ of certiorari, a basic

characteristic of the writ is that there should not be an unjustifiable delay in

applying for the remedy. Prof. G.L. Peiris, in his book on Essays on

Administrative Law in Sri Lanka (Lake House Investments 160 Ltd., pg.13 and

15) stated that, "Where a discretion is available to the Court in regard to the

grant or refusal of certiorari, the writ will generally not issue if there has been

unjustifiable delay on the part of the applicant in seeking relief ... The relevant

principle is that relief by way of certiorari must be sought punctually."

Considering the aforementioned it could be said that similar to the principle

that relief by way of Writ of Certiorari must be sought punctually, any relief

sought in the nature of writs should be filed in due course and any delay in

filing an application should be justified by the party themselves. It is the view

of this Court that the petitioner in the instant application has not justified to

the court the reasons for the delay.

Hence, this Court finds no reason to grant the relief in the nature of writs as

prayed by the petitioner thus refuses to grant relief prayed before this Court.

The Application is hereby dismissed.
