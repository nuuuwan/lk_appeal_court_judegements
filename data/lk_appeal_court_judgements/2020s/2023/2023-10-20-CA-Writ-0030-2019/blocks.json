Section 48B of the LDO stipulates that the spouse of the owner of a holding is entitled to succeed to it upon their death. Accordingly, in this instance, Podihamine, the wife of Subasingha, has succeeded in the two lands upon the death of Subasingha. Podihamine died in 2018. Consequently, the Petitioner has requested the 2nd Respondent to register him as the successor to the two lands on the strength of the nomination made by late Gunarathne. As I have already stated above, the Petitioner is a nephew of Gunarathne but not by blood, but by marriage. In Rule 1 of the Third Schedule the term relative is defined as a relative by blood and not by marriage. Consequently, as per Section 51 of the LDO, the Petitioner is legally not entitled to be nominated as the successor of late Subasingha.",

In P 4(b) the next entry is a purported transfer effected by late Subasingha on the 18th March 2010. The date of registration is 23rd March 2010. The Respondent challenges the validity of the above transfer. In fact, Subasinghas death occurred on the 4th October 2006 (P 9). Therefore, on the face of it, the entry regarding the transfer of the land said to have been effected by Subasingha on the 18th March 2010 should be fraudulent. However, it is not an issued before this Court. The important fact is that in both P 3(b) and P 4(b) the nomination of the Petitioner is not registered. If it is registered, there should be an entry made in between the first and second entries of both P 3(b) and P 4(b). Consequently, even if the Petitioner is nominated as the successor of Subasingha as reflected in the two ledgers P3(a) and P 4(a), since it is not registered by the Registrar of Lands in P3(b) and P 4(b) such registration is invalid.",
