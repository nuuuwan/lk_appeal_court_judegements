This is an application for revision filed on 24.08.2022 against the order of the

Learned High Court Judge of Gampaha dated 01.08.2022 in the cases No. HCBA

377/2021 and No. HCBA 288/2021. This Court will deliver one judgment with

respect to both the cases. The said order dated 01.08.2022 refused to grant bail

to the 3rd suspect or the accused-petitioner of PHC/APN/CPA/79/22 and the 2nd

suspect, the petitioner of PHC/APN/CPA/80/22 who were charged under the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of

1984 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) for the possession of 32.1 grams and

28.450 grams of heroin by the 2nd suspect and the 3rd suspect petitioner

respectively. Being aggrieved, the petitioner has preferred the present revision

application praying for, inter alia setting aside of the order of the Learned High

Court Judge of Gampaha dated 01.08.2022 and to enlarge the suspects on bail.

The facts of the case are briefly as follows. The information revealed during an

investigation of a suspect lead to the arrest of the 1st suspect, the brother of the

petitioner, one Lekamwasam Liyanage Lakmal. However, he was enlarged on bail

on the 01.10.2021 by the learned Magistrate, on the basis of the Covid 19 circular

issued by the 2nd respondent dated 13.08.2021. Upon further information

received by the 1st suspect, five suspects, including the petitioner have been

arrested and produced before the Magistrate Court on 15.06.2021 and were

detained till the 21.06.2021 for further interrogation. However, the fourth and

the fifth suspects were granted bail on the 21.06.2021 while the remaining

suspects including the petitioner was ordered to be kept in remand custody. The

petitioner has then filed a bail application on the 06.10.2021 in the High Court

of Gampaha bearing the case no. HCBA 377/2021.

The petitioner has averred the following circumstances as exceptional

circumstances before the High Court:

1. The 1st Respondent has reported falsified facts against the petitioner.

2. The police were not able to recover illegal substances from the petitioners

possession.

3. The 1st respondent submitted misleading facts to the Magistrates Court.

4. The petitioner has no prior convictions.

The learned High Court Judge has dismissed the bail application on the grounds

that the averred circumstances do not posit any exceptionality and thus cannot

be enlarged on bail in terms of Section 83 (1) of the Act. The relevant provision

can be reproduced in the following manner.

"No person suspected or accused of an offence under Section 54A or Section

54B of this Ordinance shall be released on bail, except by the High Court, in

exceptional circumstances"

As such, in order to enlarge a suspect on bail in terms of the above law, the

petitioner must convince the court of the existence of exceptional circumstances

which shock the conscious of the court. However, it has been held by the learned

High Court Judge that the averred circumstances of the petitioner do no warrant

exceptionality, and thus cannot be enlarged on bail. Aggrieved by the said order

4

CA-CPA-79-22 Page 4 of 6 14/02/2023 IJ-08-23

dated 01.08.2022 and pleading that the order of the High Court is irregular,

illegal and contrary to law, the petitioner pleads the following exceptional

circumstances before this Court.

1. The petitioner avers that the suspects have been treated with

discrimination where the 4th and the 5th suspect has been granted bail

while the petitioner and the 2nd suspect languish in remand custody.

2. The respondent has concocted or falsified facts against the petitioner.

In the event the circumstances averred are deemed to be of such exceptional

nature warranting an intervention, this Court will exercise its revisionary

jurisdiction against the impugned order of the High Court.

However, in considering the first averment, this Court is of the observation that

the circumstances of the suspects, although transpired in the same series of

events, cannot be treated as the same, as the suspects in question, namely the

2nd and the 3rd suspects, were caught in the act of packaging heroin along with

the electronic weighing equipment used for the said purpose. The 2nd suspect was

in possession of 32.1 grams of heroin and the 3rd suspect i.e. the petitioner was

in possession of 28.450 grams of heroin which amounts to a commercial

quantity.

The above circumstances of the suspects evince the gravity of the offence

committed and as such the treatment of other suspects in this regard does not

amount to exceptional circumstances as the 4th suspect was granted bail under

the Covid 19 circular issued on 13.08.2021 and the 5th suspect was granted bail

as he was not in possession of illegal substances at the time of arrest.

As such, it is the view of this Court that the primary pleading of the petitioner

that the suspects have been treated with discrimination is without credit and

refutable as the circumstances surrounding the suspects cannot be treated alike.

The pure quantity of heroin possessed infers a commercial purpose for such

possession of drugs and the utensils recovered during the arrest further

buttresses the gravity of the offence and the commercial nature of the act which

manifests a prima facie case against the two suspects.

The revisionary power of this Court is discretionary and such discretion is

exercised under Section 83 (1) of the Act, in instances where exceptional

circumstances are extant which shocks the conscious of this Court so as to

enable this court to intervene. As expounded in Attorney General vs.

Ranasinghe and others 1993 2 SLR p 81, in the presence of such exceptional

circumstances, the revisionary power of the court is exercised in the following

instances:

1) To satisfy this court as to the legality of any sentence or order passed by the

High Court or Magistrates Court.

2) To satisfy this court as to the propriety of any sentence or order passed by

such court.

3) To satisfy this court as to the regularity of the proceedings of such court

However, this Court is of the observation that regarding the averments of the

petitioner, there is no exceptionality which shocks the conscious of this Court.

The petitioner has pleaded that the suspects were treated unequally as the fourth

and the fifth suspects were granted bail eventually while the petitioner herself,

being the 3rd suspect and the 2nd suspect were refused bail. It is the view of this

court that the petitioners averment of supposed discrimination is refutable and

does not warrant exceptionality as the suspects were treated differently

depending on their different circumstances. Contrary to the circumstances of the

fifth and the fourth suspects, the petitioner and the 2nd suspect were arrested

while packaging heroin with the utensils used for the act and the released

suspects were not found in similar circumstances to be treated alike. Moreover,

this Court observes that, with regards to the petitioners claim that the

respondent has concocted or falsified facts against petitioner, the verity of such

facts cannot be determined at this stage of the case, therefore such an averment

does not emulate exceptionality.

This Court is inclined to intervene only in the presence of exceptional

circumstances which shock the conscious of this court as per the revisionary

jurisdiction bestowed upon it. However, taking into consideration the

circumstances of the 2nd and the 3rd suspects, where the pure quantity of heroin

6

CA-CPA-79-22 Page 6 of 6 14/02/2023 IJ-08-23

found in the possession of the 2nd and third suspects were 32.1 grams and

28.450 grams respectively and the arrest being made while they were packeting

drugs, the averred circumstances do not warrant exceptionality.

Hence, it is observed that there is no irregularity or illegality of the order of the

High Court in refusing the application of bail as there is no inordinate or

oppressive delays nor any other circumstances which constitute exceptional

circumstances.

For the above reasons, there is no reason for this Court to intervene in the order

of the High Court as the learned High Court Judge has correctly dismissed the

bail application. Thereby, this Court affirms the order dated 01.08.22 by the

learned High Court Judge in cases no. HCBA 377/2021 and No. HCBA

288/2021.

The application is hereby dismissed without costs.
