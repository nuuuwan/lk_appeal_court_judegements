Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner in the instant Application seeks the issuance of a writ of certiorari quashing

the order dated 20.08.2019 marked 'Z' made by the Members of the 38th Respondent,

University Services Appeals Board ('USAB') on the purported basis that the said Order is

illegal and that the USAB has seriously erred in law in failing to act in terms of the mandate

given under Universities Act No. 16 of 1978. A writ of certiorari quashing the

recommendation made in 'P14' by the Selection Committee to of the 1st Respondent

University of Kelaniya ('University') appoint the 28th, 29th and 30th Respondents to the posts

of Lecturer (Probationary) and further, writs of mandamus and quo warranto have also been

sought by the Petitioner.

The main contention of the Respondents is that the Petitioner has filed;

a) a fundamental rights Application bearing case No. SCFR/111/2019, ('FR

Application')

b) an Action in the District Court bearing Case No. DSP 35/2019, and

c) an Application at the USAB bearing case No. USAB 977

on the same subject matter, seeking nearly identical reliefs.

The Petition of the Petitioner to the Supreme Court is dated 14.03.2019. The Supreme Court

in the said FR Application has declined to grant leave to proceed on 09.12.2021. The instant

writ Application has been filed on 18.02.2021, almost 2 years after the Application was made

to the Supreme Court. The Application to USAB submitted by the Petitioner is dated

20.03.2019.

Page 5 of 14

The Respondents contend that the Petitioner is not entitled to maintain the instant

Application in this Court on the same grounds upon which the Petitioner has filed the said

FR Application in which the Supreme Court has arrived at a finality by refusing leave to

proceed. The Respondents further assert that the Petitioner is guilty of laches. Accordingly,

the Respondents move that this Application be dismissed in limine without issuing formal

notice on the Respondents.

At this threshold stage I am compelled to examine whether the Petitioner has satisfied this

Court that there is a proper basis for claiming judicial review. It is the duty of this Court to

identify the appropriate issue on which the case can properly proceed before formally issuing

notice on the Respondents.1 As such, I should be guided by the arguability principle which

requires the party who applies for judicial review to satisfy that there is an arguable ground

for judicial review which has a realistic prospect of success.2 In assaying the above objections

raised by the Respondents it is important to ascertain;

i. whether the Petitioner is entitled to file a writ Application on the same grounds

alleged in the Supreme Court in the said FR Application,

ii. whether the facts necessary to support the claim in the instant Application and the

reliefs sought are the same as those in the said earlier adjudication in the Supreme

Court,

iii. whether the Supreme Court has given an order or arrived at a conclusion in the

said FR Application upon/considering the same cause of action or same course of

dealing between same parties referred to in the instant writ Application.

As regard to the first query above, I am inclined to follow the precedent enunciated in Shanthi

Chandrasekaram v. D. B. Wijethunga and others [1992] 2 Sri L. R. 293 which appears to be a

matter referred to the Supreme Court by the Court of Appeal under Article 126(3) of the

Constitution.3 In the said case, the Supreme Court has observed that there could be

transactions or situations in which, on virtually the same facts and grounds, a person appears

Page 6 of 14

entitled to claim relief from the Court of Appeal through a writ application under Article 140

or 141 of the Constitution; also from the Supreme Court by an FR Application under Article

126. Mark Fernando J. has stated therein;

"Article 126(1) confers sole and exclusive jurisdiction in respect of infringements of fundamental

rights, and Article 126(2) prescribes how that jurisdiction may be invoked. Article 126(3) is not

an extension of or exception to those provisions; if a person who alleges that his fundamental

rights have been violated fails to comply with them, he cannot smuggle that question into a writ

application in which relief is claimed on different facts and grounds, and thereby seek a decision

from this Court. On the other hand, there could be transactions or situations in which, on

virtually the same facts and grounds, a person appears entitled to claim relief from the Court of

Appeal through a writ application under Article 140 or 141, and from this Court by a

fundamental rights application under Article 126. Since those provisions do not permit the

joinder of such claims, the aggrieved party would have to institute two different proceedings, in

two different courts, in respect of virtually identical "causes of action" arising from the same

transaction, unless there is express provision permitting joinder. The prevention, in such

circumstances, of a multiplicity of suits (with their known concomitants) is the object of Article

126(3)."

The learned State Counsel who appears for the 1st to 27th and 33rd to 36th Respondents placed

reliance on Saundra Marakkala Imasha Lahiruni Upeksha and others v. Hasitha Kesara

Weththimuni and others CA/Writ/166/2017 decided on 04.04.2019 in which His Lordship

Justice Janak De Silva referring to the above paragraph in Shanthi Chandrasekaram Case, has

held that;

"Thus, it is possible that there could be transactions or situations where a party can seek remedies

both in the Supreme Court, invoking the fundamental rights jurisdiction, and this Court,

invoking the writ jurisdiction on virtually identical causes of action..."

In light of the above, I am of the view that a litigant is entitled to file a writ application on the

same facts and grounds upon which he or she sought reliefs from the Supreme Court by way

of an FR Application provided that joinder of such claims is not permitted by a written law.

It is interesting to note how the Section 34 of the Civil Procedure Code has been formulated

Page 7 of 14

and it states that 'Every action shall include the whole of the claim which the plaintiff is

entitled to make in respect of the cause of action...'

Anyhow, as per the observations made by Fernando J. in the above case, it needs

consideration by this Court whether the Petitioner has unduly attempted to smuggle the

question referred to Supreme Court into the instant writ Application. The learned State

Counsel strenuously argued that the main reliefs prayed for in the said FR Application and in

the instant Application are identical and as such the doctrine of res judicata should be applied

to evaluate whether the cause of action of this instant Application has already been dealt with

by the Supreme Court.

Res judicata in an administrative context is illustrated by a decision of the House of Lords

about the making of Sludge Lane, Wakefield4 and the House of Lords in that case has treated

the original decision as a judgement in rem, binding on everyone. (Vide- Administrative

Law by the late Sir William Wade and Christopher Forsyth, 11th Edition, Oxford, pp 202,

203).

Res judicata takes two distinct forms: issue estoppel and cause of action estoppel. In brief

terms, issue estoppel prevents a litigant from raising an issue that has already been decided in

a previous proceeding. 5 Cause of action estoppel prevents a litigant from pursuing a matter

that was or should have been the subject of a previous proceeding.6 If the technical

requirements of issue estoppel or cause of action estoppel are not met, it may be possible to

invoke the doctrine of abuse of process to prevent relitigation of matters.7 (Vide- 'What is

Settled is Settled: the Doctrine of Res Judicata' by Maurice Mirosolin, Pacific Law Group,

< https://pacificlaw.ca/cased-closed-doctrine-of-res-judicata/> (accessed 31 July 2023))

I wish to borrow the information illustrated by the author in the said Law Blog by the Pacific

Law Group in arriving at a conclusion in the instant Application. The said author discussed

further the aspects on abuse of process of court stating that; "Judges have an inherent and

residual discretion to prevent an abuse of the courts process. This concept of abuse of process

4 Wakefield Cpn v. Cooke [1904] AC 31. 5 Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79 23 SCC 63. 6 Erschbamer v. Wallster, 2013 BCCA 76. See also Henderson v. Henderson (1843), 3 Hare 100, 67 E.R. 313 at 319. 7 R. v. Power, 1994 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at p. 616), and as oppressive treatment : R. v. Conway, 1989 CanLII 66 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, at p. 1667.

Page 8 of 14

was described at common law as proceedings unfair to the point that they are contrary to

the interest of justice (R. v. Power, 1994 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at p. 616),

and as oppressive treatment : R. v. Conway, 1989 CanLII 66 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659,

at p. 1667.....It is a flexible doctrine unencumbered by the specific requirements of concepts

such as issue estoppel. See House of Spring Gardens Ltd. v. Waite, [1990] 3 W.L.R. 347 at p.

358, [1990] 2 All E.R. 990 (C.A.). One circumstance in which abuse of process has been

applied is where the litigation before the court is found to be in essence an attempt to relitigate

a claim which the court has already determined."

The Wade & Forsyths above Administrative Law which is considered as the definitive

account of the principles of judicial review states (at p. 201) that one special variety of estoppel

is res judicata and that results from the rule which prevents the parties to a judicial

determination from litigating the same question over again, even though the determination is

demonstrably wrong.

S. Eva Wanasundera PC J has observed in Manamalage Michael Ranjith Fernando alias

Mahipalage Michael Ranjith Perera v. Manamalage Marcus Fernando and another SC Appeal No.

117/2011 decided on 15.03.2017:

"In Roman Dutch Law, K.D.P. Wickremasinghe in his book Civil Procedure in Ceylon states

that, for the doctrine of res judicata to operate, there must be three requisites, namely, same

person, same thing and same cause of action. It is contained in Sec. 207 of the Civil Procedure

Code."

In order to consider of adopting the principles of res judicata including the concept of abuse

of process, I must now examine whether a.) the Petitioner has cited the same parties as

Respondents in the said FR Application and the instant Application and also b.) whether the

reliefs sought by the Petitioner in both above Applications are nearly identical and are based

on same issues or transactions.

The Petitioner has filed both the FR Application and the instant writ Application against the

University of Kelaniya, Members of the Council of the University, the Registrar of the

University, University Grants Commission and its' Chairman, Vice Chairman, etc. The 28th,

29th and 30th Respondents of the FR Application are the candidates selected by the Selection

Page 9 of 14

Committee and appointed to the post of Lecturer-Probationary in the Department of Political

Science, Faculty of Social Sciences of the 1st Respondent University. The 31st and 32nd

Respondents are the candidates who had been purportedly allocated higher marks than the

Petitioner by the said Selection Committee. The caption of the FR Application and the 2nd

paragraph 2 of the Petition of the Petitioner in the instant writ Application evince that the

Petitioner has filed the instant Application against the same parties mentioned above.

Moreover, it is essential to be spotlighted the primary grievance alleged in paragraph 31 of

the said FR Application, which reads;

"...the Petitioner states that the decision taken by the Council of the 1st Respondent

University at its meeting held on 12th February 2019 to appoint the 28th to 30th

Respondents for the Posts of Lecturer (Probationary) in Political Science of the 1st

Respondent University is irregular, unreasonable, illegal, arbitrary, capricious and

contrary to the procedure followed in the past and in violation of the rules of natural

justice..."

The first portion of paragraph 26 of the Petition filed in the writ Application is verbatim and

accordingly, it is abundantly clear that the reliefs sought in the Court of Appeal are completely

based on the same grounds/issues where the Petitioner has invoked the fundamental rights

jurisdiction in the Supreme Court.

The main reliefs sought by the Petitioner as per the prayer in the said FR Application are:

(b) "Declare that the Petitioner's fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution has been infringed by the 1st to the 27th Respondents;"

(c) "Declare that the Petitioner's fundamental right guaranteed under Article 14(1)(g) of

the Constitution have been infringed by the 1st to the 27th Respondents;"

(d) "Quash the recommendation made in P14 by the Selection Committee of which 2nd,

5th, 19th, 22nd, 25th and 26th Respondents are members that met on 6th and 7th February

2019, to recommend the Council to appoint the 28th to 30th respondents as Lecturer

(Probationary) in Political Science of the 1st Respondent University;"

Page 10 of 14

(e) "Quash the decision made by the Council at its 468th meeting held on 12th February

2019, of which 2nd to 24th Respondents are members, to appoint the 28th to 30th

respondents as Lecturer (Probationary) in Political Science of the 1st Respondent

University;"

(f) "Order the 1st Respondent University to appoint me as an Lecturer (Probationary) in

Political Science of the 1st Respondent University effective from 15th February 2019;"

Whereas, the main reliefs sought by the Petitioner in the prayer of the instant Application are:

b) "Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the Order (Z)

dated 20th August 2019, made by the 39th and 41st Respondents of the 38th Respondent

USAB;"

c) "Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari to quash the

recommendation made in P14, by the Selection Committee that met on 6th and 7th of

February 2019 to appoint 28th, 29th and the 30th Respondents for the posts of Lecturer

(Probationary) of the Department of Political Science, Faculty of Social Sciences of

the 1st Respondent University;"

d) "Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision

made by the Governing Council at its 468th meeting held on 12th February 2019 to

appoint 28th, 29th and the 30th Respondents for the posts of Lecturer (Probationary) of

the Department of Political Science, Faculty of Social Sciences of the 1st Respondent

University;"

e) "Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari to quash the letters of

appointments already issued to the 28th, 29th and the 30th Respondents appointing them

as Lecturer (Probationary) of the 1st Respondent University."

g) "Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of Mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent

University to appoint me as an Lecturer (Probationary) in Political Science of the 1st

Respondent University effective from 15th February 2019;"

On a careful perusal of the documents submitted to Court and considering all circumstances

of this case, it appears that the Petitioner in each proceeding before this Court and Supreme

Page 11 of 14

Court has predicated his claim on the same underlying factual transaction and has requested

nearly identical reliefs. However, it needs to pay special attention to the relief sought by the

Petitioner in the instant Application to get the order of the USAB marked 'Z' quashed.

As such, I must examine the factual foundation for the relief sought in the proceedings before

the USAB. The Petitioner submitted the Application to the USAB under Section 16 of the

Universities Act No.16 of 1978 and the Petitioner has reproduced the contents of paragraph

31 of the FR Application (marked 'X') in the Application to the USAB as well. Thus, it appears

that the said Application to USAB also has been made in respect of the issues and causes of

action similar to the proceedings in the FR Application and the writ Application. Despite

such findings, it is important to note that the USAB by its' decision delivered on 13.10.2020

('Z') has dismissed the Application of the Petitioner on the basis that the USAB in terms of

Section 86 of the Universities Act was not competent to quash an appointment already made

and also to make an order that another candidate be appointed. I am mindful of the fact that

no estoppel/res judicata would legitimize an action which is ultra vires. In such context, I am

convinced that the USAB has not pronounced an illegal or unreasonable order which needs

evaluation at a merit stage of the instant Application.

In the circumstances, it is apparent that the factual foundation for the reliefs sought in each

of the above proceedings are similar and I am satisfied that all three of the above proceedings

have been initiated based on the same course of dealings between the same parties. In other

words, the Petitioner has sought reliefs from the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and the

USAB on the same cause of action upon which the principles of res judicata elaborated above

can be employed easily. Although the conclusion of the proceedings before USAB is not

material to my findings on res judicata, it is paramount to note that the proceedings before

the Supreme Court in the said FR Application have been concluded. This Court may not be

able to adopt the principles of res judicata in a writ application, in an event where the

proceedings before the Supreme Court were not concluded.

It needs to be stressed that the Petitioner has failed to give adequate and appropriate reasons

for maintaining the FR Application and the writ Application parallelly. With the modern

trends and the complexity of issues in present day society while recognizing the right of a

litigant to procure similar reliefs through multiple adjudications, I must emphasize that it is a

Page 12 of 14

fundamental requirement that the suitor should satisfy this Court with exceptional grounds

that the factual foundation in such multiple proceedings do not amount to an abuse of process

of court and also the suitor is not estopped by any established principle of law. In R. A.

Piyaratna and others vs. Buddhist and Pali University of Sri Lanka and others

CA/WRIT/133/2022 decided on 10.06.2022 I have observed that the grounds for review in

writ applications are inextricably interwoven with the fundamental rights recognized by law

and however the adoption of such grounds should be carefully done by Review Courts subject

to limitations discussed therein based on the respective jurisdiction of the Court.

In the said Shanthi Chandrasekaram Case, Mark Fernando J. concentrating on the provisions

of Article 140/141 and 126 has taken the view that those provisions do not permit joinder of

such claims and also observed that Article 126(1) confers the Supreme Court sole and

exclusive jurisdiction in respect of infringement of fundamental rights and such jurisdiction

of the Supreme Court in respect of Article 126(3) extends not only to the question of

infringement, but to the entire Application. However, if a person who seeks redress from

Supreme Court alleges that his fundamental rights have been infringed, he cannot smuggle

that question into a writ Application parallelly by seeking reliefs on different facts and grounds

abusing the process of Court and also without satisfying the Court of Appeal with adequate

and sufficient reasons.

The term forum shopping, in my view, also contributes to abuse the process of Court. "Forum

shopping has been defined as a litigant's attempt "to have his action tried in a particular court

or jurisdiction where he feels he will receive the most favorable judgement or verdict".8 The

American legal system tends to treat forum shopping as unethical and inefficient; parties who

forum shop are accused of abusing the adversary system and squandering judicial resources.

Forum shopping, however, is more complex than these characterizations suggest." (Vide-

'Forum Shopping Reconsidered' Harvard Law Review, vol.103, no.7, 1990, p 1677

https://www.jstor.org/stable/1341283 (accessed 31 July 2023))

By wide reading I have found that the Indian Judiciary has time and again condemned the

practice of forum shopping by litigants and termed it as an abuse of law. In M/S. Chetak

8 Black's Law Dictionary 590 (5th ed. 1979)

Page 13 of 14

Construction Ltd. v. Om Prakash & Ors decided on 20.04.1998 the Supreme Court of India has

held; "We certainly, cannot approve of any attempt on the part of any litigant to go "forum shopping".

A litigant cannot be permitted `choice' of the `forum' and every attempt at "forum shopping" must be

crushed with a heavy hand".

I shall now try to deviate to a certain extent from the traditional definition given to abuse of

process through forum shopping. It would be convenient for me to describe this by referring

to the law in respect of transferring of cases on various lawful grounds. Superior Courts have

considered the aspect of a judge being biased, among other reasons, in order to make a

determination regarding the transfer of cases. The eloquent words of Wanasundera, J. in

Hewamanne v De Silva [1983] 1 Sri L.R. 1 at 24 are apt here.

"The proper administration of justice requires judges who are skilled and learned. It is even more

important that their decisions are honest and impartial and are arrived at without pressures or

interference however slight or from whatever quarter. For, truly, justice must not only be done

but it must also appear to be done."

Thus, although I agree with the concept that the forum shopping should not be allowed within

our court system, a thin margin should be left for a litigant to have multiple proceedings when

it does not appear to the litigants that justice has been done. This should be apart from the

other grounds discussed above in this regard.

On a careful consideration of the whole matter and based on the cause of action and the

course of dealings between the same parties in proceedings initiated by the Petitioner in

Supreme Court and Court of Appeal, I am compelled to arrive at the conclusion that all the

requisites discussed above to reject the instant Application on the principles of res judicata are

fulfilled. Moreover, I am of the view that the Petitioner is guilty for abusing the process of

court. The main contributory factor for my said conclusion is the failure of the Petitioner to

give adequate and sufficient reasons for maintaining the instant Application despite the

Supreme Court, which has the sole and exclusive jurisdiction on fundamental rights

Applications, assaying a similar cause of action and course of dealings among the same

parties. When analyzing the chronological arrangement of dates chosen by the Petitioner to

apply to the Supreme Court, USAB and to Court of Appeal, I need to emphasize that the

Petitioner is guilty of laches. The Petitioner has recourse to the Court of Appeal only after the

Page 14 of 14

Supreme Court in the said FR Application takes a decision unfavourable to the Petitioner.

The Petitioner has waited almost 2 years until some favourable consequential or ancillary

decision was taken and therefore, the delayed Application for judicial review cannot be

assumed to be reasonable.

The special circumstances of this case imply that the Petitioner has failed to satisfy the initial

threshold requirement in order to warrant this Court to issue formal notice of this Application

to the Respondents. Therefore, upholding the preliminary objections dealt with in this order,

I proceed to refuse this Application.
