Judgment

This appeal emanates from the order made by the learned High Court Judge of the

Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Rathnapura exercising revisionary jurisdiction.

It appears that the officer in charge of the Rathnapura police station had filed an information

in terms of section 66 1 (a) of the Primary Court Procedure Act No 44 of 1979 pursuant to

Page 3 of 5

the complaint made by the 1st party Respondent against the 2nd party Respondent for

obstructing the existing roadway used by the 1st party Respondent to access his house.

The learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge having inquired about

the matter, had held against the 2nd party Respondent directing not to obstruct the 1st party

Respondents right of way providing access to his house.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the 2nd party Respondent-Petitioner had invoked the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa holden in

Rathnapura.

The learned High Court Judge by order dated 20. 07.2017 had dismissed the revision

application of the 2nd party Respondent-Petitioner on the grounds that 2nd party Respondent-

Petitioner is guilty of laches and also that no exceptional circumstances were established by

the 2nd party Respondent-Petitioner warranting the intervention of court by way of revision.

According to Section 74 (2) of the Primary Code Procedure Act, no right of appeal is provided

against an order made in terms of Section 66 of the said act.

Nevertheless, if there is an injustice caused to a party or any miscarriage of justice, the

aggrieved party is allowed to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court. In this

backdrop the Court of Appeal has to look into the matter of whether the learned High Court

judge has properly exercised his duty to ascertain whether any injustice caused to a party or

whether there is a miscarriage of justice occurred by the order of the learned magistrate. In

view of the judgement in Aluthhewage Harshini Chandrika and others Vs. Officer in Charge

and others C.A. PHC 65/2003- C.A.M 21.04.2020 the Court of Appeal is not empowered

to correct the errors made by the learned magistrate.

Justice Ranjit Silva opined in the case of Nandawathi and other Vs Mahindasoma [2005 (2)

S.L.R 218] that,

I am of the opinion that this particular right of appeal in the circumstances

should not be taken as an appeal in the true sense, but in fact as an application

to examine the correctness, legality or the propriety of the Order made by the

High Court Judge in the exercise of revisionary powers. The Court of Appeal

should not under the guise of an appeal attempt to re-hear or reevaluate the

evidence led in the main case.

It is observable in paragraph 10 of the revision application dated 28. 05. 2014 filed by the

2nd party Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner (Appellant) in the Provincial High Court of

Sabaragamuwa holden in Rathnapura that 2nd party Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner

Page 4 of 5

(Appellant) has attempted to plead certain exceptional grounds to set aside the Order made

by the learned Magistrate. However, the mere existence of exceptional circumstances itself

would not allow this court to invoke its revisionary jurisdiction. Thus, to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction, exceptional circumstances should be precisely and expressly averred

in the revision petition.

In the instant case the learned High Court Judge had observed that the findings of the learned

Magistrate were correct. Whereas, the learned Magistrate had determined that the 1st party

Respondent-Respondent had been using the disputed roadway and he is entitled to use it to

access his house. The learned Magistrate has also held that the 2nd party Respondent-

Petitioner (Appellant) had not proved that the impugned roadway had not been used by the

1st party Respondent-Respondent.

Therefore, it is apparent that the 2nd party Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner (Appellant) had

not substantiated his contentions, thus failing to prove any miscarriage of justice or any

injustice caused to him.

It was held in the case Athurupana Vs. Premasinghe B.L.R [2004] Vol. X Part II P. 60,

Every illegality, impropriety or irregularity does not warrant the exercise of

revisionary jurisdiction, but such jurisdiction will be exercised only where the

illegality, impropriety or irregularity in the proceeding has resulted in a miscarriage

of justice by the party affected being denied what is lawfully due to the party.

It was held in the case Bank of Ceylon Vs. Kaleel [2004] (1) SLR 284:

The Court to exercise revisionary jurisdiction, the Order challenged must have

occasioned failure of justice and manifestly erroneous which goes beyond an error or

defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would instantly react to it. In other

words, the Order complained of is of such nature which would have shocked the

conscience of Court.

In view of the afore-cited judgments, it should be noted that the existence of exceptional

circumstances is a precondition for exercising revisionary powers of this court. In the instant

case, the 2nd party Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner (Appellant) had not established the

existence of exceptional circumstances warranting the learned High Court Judge to exercise

revisionary powers.

In view of the foregoing reasons, it the learned High Court Judge has affirmed the order dated

24.02.2014 of the learned Magistrate. As no miscarriage of justice or any injustice has been

caused to the 2nd party Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner (Appellant) the learned High Court

Page 5 of 5

Judge had dismissed the application of the 2nd party Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner

(Appellant).

Therefore, we see no reason to interfere with the order dated 20.07.2017 of the learned High

Court Judge and the order of the learned Magistrate dated 24.02. 2014.

As such, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at LKR. 25,000/-.
