According to the Petitioner, the reasons provided in the Order dismissing the appeal was that the USAB has neither the expertise nor the jurisdiction to pronounce the correctness of the University authorities. There is no irregularity or illegality in respect of the decision (P 17). The Petitioner alleges that the Order of the USAB contains only re-production of what transpired at the inquiry and there were no its own findings whatsoever.

    "text": "The Court, in any case, be reluctant to enter into issues of academic or pastoral judgment which the University was equipped to consider in breadth and in-depth but on which any judgment of the Courts would be jejune and inappropriate. That undoubtedly included such questions as what mark or class a student ought to be awarded or whether an aegrotat was justified4. In the case of Abeysundara Mudiyanselage Sarath Weera Bandara v. University of Colombo and others5 the Court of Appeal observed as follows in this regard; The consistent judicial opinion, therefore, is that in matters which lie within the jurisdiction of the educational institutions and their authorities, the Court has to be slow and circumspect before interfering with any decision taken by them in connection therewith. Unless a decision is demonstrably illegal, arbitrary, and unconscionable, their province and authority should not be encroached upon. This is mainly because of the want of judicially manageable standards and the necessary expertise to assess, scrutinize, and judge the merits and/or demerits of such decisions. Dealing with the scope of interference in matters relating to orders passed by the authorities of educational institutions, the Courts should normally be very slow to pass orders in regard thereto and such matters should normally be left to the decision of the educational authorities. In the case of Dr. Karunananda v. Open University of Sri Lanka and others6 the Supreme Court addressed the above issue in a manner that demonstrates the parameters of the Court's intervention. Therefore, although there may be cautionary remarks indicating a reluctance to enter into academic judgment, I am not in agreement with the view that academic decisions are beyond challenge. There is no necessity for the Courts to unnecessarily intervene in matters \"purely of academic nature,\" since such issues would be best dealt with by academics, who are fully equipped to consider the question in hand. However, if there are allegations against decisions of academic establishments that fall under the category stipulated",

The decision of the Selection Committee can be interfered with only on limited grounds, such as illegality or patent material irregularity in the constitution of the Committee or its procedure vitiating the selection, or proved mala fides affecting the selection etc. In Chairman, J and K State Board of Education Vs. Feyaz Ahmed Malik and Others9, the Indian Supreme Court while stressing the importance of the",

    "text": "In the argument before this Court, the Petitioner raised several grounds in support of his application. The main ground is that the Petitioner's bachelor's degree with a specialization is relevant to the subject of Medical Laboratory Sciences, which was denied by the University authorities. The Petitioners bachelors degree falls under the first part of the qualification required under Clause 3 (a). There was no issue regarding the relevancy of Petitioners post-graduate degree, the second requirement, under Clause 3 (b). According to the letter issued by the Assistant Registrar, Examinations and Admissions, of the University of Jaffna on the 29th March 2004 (P 2A), the Petitioner has a specialization in Agricultural Chemistry in his bachelors degree. The Petitioner asserts that his specialization is pertinent to the Medical Laboratory Sciences curriculum. The qualifications of the applicants for the aforementioned post were examined by a subcommittee. The advertisement published by the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Jaffna (P 3) itself states that only short-listed applicants will be called for an interview. The subcommittee comprised Prof. V. Tharmaratnam, Council Member (Chairman), Prof. S. Srisatkunarajah, Professor in Mathematics, Prof. G. Mikunthan, Dean/Graduate Studies, Prof. T. Velnampy, Dean/ Management Studies and Commerce, Prof. N. Gnanakumaran, Dean/ Arts. The Petitioner challenged the composition of the subcommittee on the grounds that it does not consist of any member related to Medical Laboratory Sciences. Be that as it may, the Petitioner himself submitted a report prepared by another subcommittee which made the same recommendation before the interview. The seven members of the subcommittee were Prof. (Ms) V. Arasaratnam, Vice-Chancellor (Chairperson), Dr. S. Raviraj, Dean Medicine, Dr. S. Balakumar, representing Head, Biochemistry, Dr. S. Kannathasan, Head Pathology and the Senate",

Accordingly, the subcommittee comprises the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, the Heads of the Pathology and Biochemistry departments, one other academic, and two other members. The Vice-Chancellor, who is also an academic, had been the Chairperson. The post in question was in the Medical Faculty, and it is apparent that the majority of the members are from that faculty. The qualifications of the four applicants had been evaluated by this subcommittee as well and recommended that only the 37th Respondent is eligible to be called for an interview and none other. The Petitioners argument that the subcommittee that short-listed the applicants who should be called for the interview did not consist of any medical academic, medical professional allied health science professional is defeated by his own document, the annexure to P 12. The Petitioner submitted to this Court a comparison between the curriculum of the degree in Medical Laboratory Sciences and the degree in Agricultural Science, prepared by him, marked as P 7. The 5th and 7th Respondents submitted the document marked R 3 containing the B.Sc. Agriculture curriculum for the year 1998 and the curriculum for the Bachelor of Science degree in Medical Laboratory Sciences marked R 4. However, as it was correctly observed by the USAB, this Court also does not have the expertise to pronounce upon the relevancy of the subjects without any external assistance such as expert evidence. This Court lacks such evidence in this application. Therefore, as it was observed by Professor Wade in his treatise Administrative Law and in the judicial precedence of this country which I have cited above in this judgment, it is best for this Court to leave it to competent personnel. The 5th and 7th Respondents also submitted a report prepared by the Head of the Unit of Allied Health Science Ms. D. Thabotharn (R 2) on the relevancy of the B.Sc. Agriculture degree to the B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Sciences curriculum. Based on the analysis, the Head of the unit of Allied Health Sciences has expressed the view that most of the subjects in the agriculture curriculum deal with plants, cultivation, crops, seeds, weeds, animals, poultry, dairy, meat, fish production, soil science, and food science whereas, the M.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Sciences curriculum deal with the Laboratory analysis",

Accordingly, the finding was that the B.Sc. agriculture curriculum has no relevance to the B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Sciences curriculum, except for the few observations mentioned in R 2. Consequently, the Vice Chancellor of Jaffna University informed the Petitioner in his letter dated 4th November 2016 that since the Petitioner does not possess a degree with specialization in the relevant subject, he is not qualified for the post of Senior Lecturer (Grade II). It was also stated that since the Petitioner submitted his certificate of M.Sc. in Nutrition and Food Technology obtained from the Madhuri Kamaraj University (Distance Education), only after the closing date of the applications and the Petitioner has not even mentioned this qualification in his application, the Petitioner has failed to satisfy the requirements for the post (P 8). In fact, although the Petitioner has obtained his M.Sc. postgraduate degree on the 28th November 2015 (P 2B) he has not mentioned the same in his application for the post (P4) dated 7th January 2015. Obviously, any document submitted after the closing date of the applications should not be taken into account. Moreover, the issue with the Petitioner's qualification is with respect to the relevance of his bachelor's degree and not with his postgraduate degree. Accordingly, I am of the view that the reasons given by the Vice Chancellor in his letter P 8 are reasonable and adequate. Consequently, the decision is not arbitrary and unconscionable. The Petitioner also stated that he received the letter (P 8) after the interview. The Petitioners attempt was to say that the interview was held without communicating reasons for not calling him for the interview. However, there is no proof before the Court that the Petitioner received the letter late. Nevertheless, at this juncture, the pertinent question arises as to whether the committee should have given a hearing to the Petitioner before short-listing the applicant. In the case of Jawaharlal Nehru University v. B. S.10, the Indian Supreme Court was dealing with a case where a student of the university was removed from the rolls for unsatisfactory academic performance without being given any pre-decisional hearing.

    "text": "above issue Reddy J., observed that if the competent academic authorities examine and assess the work of a student over a period of time and declare his work unsatisfactory, the rules of natural justice may be excluded. It was held that the very nature of academic adjudication appears to negate any right of an opportunity to be heard. The task of the subcommittees had been to assess the educational qualifications of the applicant and not to assess the abilities of the applicants. Moreover, as I have already stated above, the advertisement calling for applications itself states that only the short-listed applicants will be called for an interview. In the above circumstances, it is my considered view that the subcommittee need not give a hearing to the applicants at the stage of shortlisting. In light of the above analysis, I hold that the decision of the Vice Chancellor, that the Petitioner has not satisfied the requirements for the post of Senior Lecturer (Grade II) in Medical Laboratory Sciences is not tainted with illegality, irrationality, or procedural impropriety. Does the 37th Respondent possess the necessary qualifications? The 37th Respondent falls under the second category of Clause 3 (a). Admittedly, the 37th Respondent possesses a B.Sc. degree in Zoology with a first class11. Under the second category, the relevancy of the bachelors degree is not a requirement, if the applicant has a bachelors degree with at least a second-class honour. However, the Petitioner challenges that the 37th Respondent has done two years of full-time research in her post-graduate degree. But the subcommittee that considered the applications for shortlisting considered the letters issued by the Principal, Vice Principal, Dr. Joy S. Michael (Co-Supervisor of the 37th Respondents M.Sc. research thesis) of Christian Medical College, Vellore, India and arrived at the conclusion that the 37th Respondent has completed M.Sc. Micro Biology of three years duration with two years of full-time research.12",
