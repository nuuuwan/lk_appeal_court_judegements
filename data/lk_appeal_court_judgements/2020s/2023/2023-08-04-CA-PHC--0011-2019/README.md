JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The Officer-in-Charge of Kubukgate Police Station (hereinafter referred

to as the Complainant) had filed a case against Panwattegedera Saman

Nandana Premakumara the Accused for committing an offence under

the Forest Ordinance for transporting timber without permit in the

Magistrate Court of Kurunegala under the case No.7928 on 28.06.2018.

As the Accused pleaded guilty to the charge, he was sentenced

accordingly. Thereafter an inquiry was held in respect of the vehicle

involved in this case. The vehicle involved in this case is a tractor with a

Trailor. The registered owner of the tractor bearing No.NW RD 3692 is

the 2nd-Appellant while the registered owner of the Trailor bearing No.

CA PHC 11/19

NW QV 9205 is the 1st-Appellant in this case. The Learned Magistrate

held an inquiry under Section 425 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act No.15 of 1979 and summoned the Petitioners to show cause as to

why the Tractor and the Trailer should not be confiscated in terms of

Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance. After the inquiry the Learned

Magistrate pronouncing the order on 15.11.2018, confiscated the said

Tractor and the Trailer to the State.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Learned Magistrate, the Appellant

filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court of North

Western Province Holden at Kurunegala to revise the order of the

Magistrate of Kurunegala. After an inquiry, the Learned High Court

Judge of Kurunegala had affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate

of Kurunegala and dismissed the said revision application on the

ground that the Appellants had failed to adduce exceptional

circumstances.

Now the Appellants filed this appeal to set aside the both orders of the

Learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala dated 28/01/2019 and

Learned Magistrate of Kurunegala dated 15.11.2018 and to release the

said Tractor and the Trailor to the Appellants.

The Appellants submitted following grounds of appeal:

1. The said orders marked as A and B are contrary to the law and

are against the weight of evidence led in the trial.

2. Both the Learned High Court Judge and the Learned Magistrate

erred in law as well as in fact in arriving at erroneous

conclusions that the Appellants had failed to establish the fact

that being taken all precautions to pre-empt the illegal activities

overlooking the evidence led at the inquiry of the vehicle which

were transpired at the inquiry.

3. That the Learned Magistrate having failed to take the evidence

in the consideration in the light of conscious efforts taken by

2nd-Appellant.

CA PHC 11/19

5 | P a g e

4. Both the Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge

having failed to evaluate the evidence led in the MC trail in

respect of the previous illegal activities which were not being

recorded.

5. Both the Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge

having failed to evaluate the evidence in respective of the facts

that whether the Appellants and or the Accused are not habitual

offenders of this nature.

6. Both the Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge

having failed to evaluate the facts in respect of the fact that the

acceptance of the fact that the Appellants did not have any

knowledge about transporting of timber without the permit.

7. Although the 2nd -Appellant testified that she has assigned a

driver with the tractor to transport in specific purpose of

transporting bricks and rocks, the Learned Magistrate had

arrived in conjectural view that the 2nd-Appellant had the

knowledge of commission of the offence committed by the

Accused.

In the revision application there is a burden on the Appellant/s to

establish that his petition discloses exceptional circumstances.

In AG Vs.Podisingho 51 NLR 385 the court held that:

the revisionary jurisdiction ought not to be exercised unless

there are exceptional circumstances.

Background of the case albeit as follows:

According to the Petitioners, the timber in question was being

transported by the Accused in the Kurunegala Magistrate Court case

No. 7928 who was in his capacity as a driver of the questioned Tractor.

The 1st-Appellant who is the registered owner of the trailer giving

evidence had said that when he gave the trailer on hire to 2nd-Appellant

had given necessary instructions not to use the trailer for illegal

activities. Further, whenever he visited the 2nd-Appellant inspected and

ensured that the trailer was not used for any illegal activities. He only

came to know the trailer had been used to transport timber when he

received a call from the 2nd-Appellant.The relevant portions of his

evidence given in the Kurunegala Magistrate are re-produced below:

But the Learned Magistrate has misdirecting himself stated that the 1st-

the trailer.

Although the 2nd-Appellant who is the registered owner of the tractor

gave evidence how she had taken necessary precautions to thwart

misuse of the tractor, but the Learned Magistrate disregarded her

evidence on the basis that she had not corroborated her evidence with

necessary witnesses.

The main contention of the Counsel for the Appellants is that both the

Learned High Court Judge and the Learned Magistrate had failed to

evaluate the evidence led at the inquiry.

The relevant portions of the MC proceedings and the order of the

Learned Magistrate re-produced above clearly indicate that the Learned

Magistrate had failed to evaluate the evidence given by the Appellants.

It is be noted that the Appellants were not regular businessman who

hires vehicles. The 1st-Appellant he a 64 years old person when the

incident had happened. The trailer he gave it on hire to 2nd-Appellant

was used for his Tractor. As his Tractor was broken down, he took

steps to hire it for a charge. No previous incident or pending cases

reported.

The 2nd-Appellant was a teacher when this incident happened. In her

evidence she said that she had taken all necessary steps to prevent the

vehicle being used for illegal activity. In respect of 2nd-Appellant too no

previous or pending cases reported.

In Manadadu v.AG [1987] 2 SLR 30 the Court held that:

The Magistrate must hear the, owner of the lorry on the question

of showing cause why the lorry is not liable to be forfeited. If the

Magistrate is satisfied with the cause shown, he must restore the

lorry to the owner.

Considering the evidence led before the Magistrate Court and the

argument advanced by the Appellants, I set aside the order dated

15.11.2018 by the Learned Magistrate of Kurunegala and the order of

the Learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala dated 28.01.2019 as they

cannot be allowed to stand.

I direct that the Trailer bearing No. NW-QV 7928 and the Tractor

bearing No. NW-RD 3692 which are the subject matters of this action

shall be released to the 1st-Appellant and 2nd-Appellant who are the

registered owners of the vehicles respectively.

Therefore, this appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this Judgment

to the High Court of Kurunegala and the Magistrate Court of

Kurunegala along with the original case record for necessary action

forthwith.
