The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted before

the High Court of Hambantota for having committed the offence of murder of one Katapodi

Kankanamge Bandula Senarathna(the Deceased) on the 7th of April 2005 an offence made

punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

Page 3 of 9

Prosecution led the evidence of ten witnesses and production marked as P1 to P6. The

Accused gave evidence under oath and called one defense witness, Rathnayaka Weerakoonge

Padmakumara. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge by his

judgement dated 1st of August 2021 found the Accused guilty of murder, convicting him and

imposing the death sentence.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction the Accused has appealed to this court.

The Following are the Grounds of Appeal set out in the written submission:

1. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the identification of the

Accused-Appellant has not been established beyond reasonable doubt.

2. The learned High Court Judge has not properly considered the evidence led at the

trial but has written the judgment based on the written submissions filed by the

defence.

3. The learned High Court Judge has erred in law by rejecting the defence of Alibi and

by shifting the burden to the defence to prove the defence of Alibi.

4. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the inherent weaknesses of the

prosecution case.

The Facts and Circumstances are that:

According to PW1, Katapodi Kankanamge Gamini (the brother of the Deceased who

resides in the house adjacent to that of the Deceased), he had spoken to the Deceased prior

to the tragic incident at approximately 10:15 p.m. During this conversation, the Deceased

informed him that he would be departing for Colombo at 10:30 p.m. Subsequently, upon

returning to his home, PW1 heard a gunshot emanating from the direction of the Deceased's

residence. He immediately rushed to the scene and found his brother lying on the kitchen

floor, with his sister-in-law (PW2) tending to him.

PW1 noted that although there was sufficient light at the rear end of the house from

an external source, the kitchenspecifically the area where the Deceased was foundwas

unlit. He observed two bleeding wounds on the Deceased's chest. The Deceased was

subsequently transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. According to PW1,

Page 4 of 9

the Deceased's wife (PW2) informed him that the Deceased had stated "Ajith shot him," and

that she had witnessed Ajith fleeing the scene.

According to PW1, two days before the incident, the Deceased had informed him of an

unresolved dispute between the Deceased and the Accused that escalated into a physical

altercation. During his cross-examination, PW1 revealed that the Deceased's residence is

located 50 meters from his own home. He elaborated that the conflict between Ajith and his

brother remained unresolved and had been ongoing. He also indicated that the distance

between the toilet and the kitchen in the Deceased's house was approximately 15 feet, and

that the property was surrounded by trees. PW1 reiterated that PW2 had informed him that

the Deceased had identified his assailant as 'Kalu Ajith.'

Additionally, PW1 stated that he was made aware that Ajith had been seen near

Chinthaka's house, located 1 1/4 km away from the Deceased's residence, in the vicinity of a

three-wheeler. We note that when this evidence was presented in court, it was unchallenged

by the Accused, although the Accused later introduced an alibi during his dock statement.

PW2, Gajaman Kankanamge Latha (the Deceaseds wife), testified that her husband

arrived home at 9:00 p.m. and was preparing to depart for Colombo. After dining, he

proceeded to the toilet to wash his hands, which she stated was approximately 10 to 12 feet

from the kitchen. Subsequent to hearing a gunshot accompanied by smoke, her husband

rushed back into the house proclaiming that he had been shot by Ajith. He was visibly

bleeding and collapsed onto the kitchen floor. Before collapsing, he told PW2 that it was Ajith

who had shot him.

Subsequently, PW2 went outside and observed Ajith fleeing from the vicinity of the

toilet, holding an object resembling a gun. She was able to identify him due to sufficient

lighting in the area. According to PW2, she was familiar with Ajith, as he was a neighbor

living in the same locality, and they had maintained a good relationship.

However, prior to these events, the Accused had not visited their house recently. PW2

was aware that a dispute had occurred between the Accused and the Deceased on April 2,

2005. Subsequent to the incident, the Deceased was transported to the hospital by PW1 and

was there pronounced dead.

In her cross-examination, PW2 disclosed that her husband had been taken into

remand as a suspect in a murder case. The Defense sought to establish that multiple

individuals named Ajith resided in the area. They also questioned the feasibility of accurately

identifying anyone at a distance of 26 1/2 feet, particularly given the time of day. However,

Page 6 of 9

PW2 maintained that she had successfully identified the Accused fleeing the scene, as he had

been a frequent visitor to their house prior to these events. When the Defense suggested that

trees near the toilet could have obstructed her view, she refuted the claim.

PW4, Katapodi Kankanamge Suseema Priyangika (Sister of the Deceased), testified

that a few days before the incident, the Deceased had informed her during a visit to her house

that he had an unresolved dispute with the Accused, who had threatened to kill him. She

added that the Accused's residence was situated six to seven houses away from theirs.

In her cross-examination, PW4 revealed that she had reported the Accused's threat to

kill her brother to the police. She noted that upon hearing the gunshot, she immediately went

to her brother's house, located 170 feet from her own. She admitted to having no recollection

of the events that transpired subsequently, as she was emotionally disturbed and therefore

not in a state to notice details. She confirmed that both her brother and sister-in-law were

unconscious at that time.

They primarily corroborate the fact that a dispute existed between the Accused and

the Deceased prior to this incident. It is also clear that this animosity had not been resolved

between the two parties. To further strengthen this allegation, the Deceased had informed

PW4 that the Accused had threatened to kill him. Additionally, when considering the

testimony of PW2, it is important to note that she has been consistent and truthful regarding

the identification of the Accused, as the defense was unable to cast any doubt.

Moreover, the defense has not challenged the dying declaration made by the

Deceased. While it is true that a dying declaration is not a statement made under oath, it can

be deemed acceptable if the defense fails to show any infirmities or weaknesses that would

cast doubt upon it. In the present case, PW2's version corroborates the dying declaration, as

she saw the Accused fleeing the scene. According to the Prosecution, the Deceased had made

a dying declaration to PW2, implicating the Accused, named Ajith, as the shooter. PW2, the

sole eyewitness present with the Deceased at the time of the incident, clearly identified the

Accused, stating that the location of the incident was well-lit, providing ample light for her

to identify him. She further stated that, as she knew the Accused to be a neighbor who had

frequently visited their house prior to these events, she had no difficulty in identifying him.

Page 7 of 9

During her cross-examination, she remained consistent and affirmative with regard to the

identity of the Accused.

I am of the view that the testimony of this witness is sufficient to establish the

identity of the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

Turning our attention to the statements of other official witnesses:

PW6, Dr. Dissanayaka Mudiyanselage Dharmasiri, the Judicial Medical Officer,

observed five entry wounds and two exit wounds in his evidence. He detailed the nature and

degree of these inflicted wounds on pages 86 to 87 of the brief. He clarified that these internal

injuries were fatal and acted as a catalyst to cause death. These wounds were identified as

gunshot wounds, and remnants of broken bullets were scattered inside the Deceased's body.

According to him, the Deceased was shot from a close range of approximately 3 meters, as

evidenced by observed burn wounds. He further stated that the victim could walk and talk

for up to five minutes after sustaining such injuries. His expert opinion attributed the cause

of death to excessive loss of blood and hemorrhagic shock.

From this evidence, we can establish the following facts:

1. The doctor observed that the gunshot came from a close range, making it clear that

the Deceased would have seen the Accused.

2. According to PW6, the victim was capable of walking and talking after sustaining such

fatal injuries. This evidence corroborates with that of PW2.

PW8, IP Prabath Deshabandu, stated that he received information about the

murder at 23:30 pm on April 7, 2005, and arrived at the crime scene at 23:55 pm. The

Deceased's wife guided PW8 to the crime scene, where he observed blood stains extending

from the living room to the kitchen.

The toilet was situated 20 ft away from the rear end of the house, and the

surrounding area was well-lit by a light bulb, sufficient for identifying anyone present. Four

Busi cubes were recovered from the floor of the dining room.

Taking into account the evidence presented by the prosecution regarding the adequate

lighting in the area, there is sufficient corroboration. Upon analyzing the testimonies of the

aforementioned witnesses, it is evident that their evidence is credible. The substance of their

information is adequate to qualify as admissible evidence. Therefore, we hold that the

testimonies of these witnesses are consistent and trustworthy.

According to the Accused, who testified under oath, he was at Chinthaka's party at

the time of the incident. This claim was corroborated by DW1 Ratnayaka, who testified on

behalf of the Accused. However, the Accused failed to present any suggestion to the witnesses

regarding his defense of alibi. It is important to note that the Accused also failed to specify

who had assaulted him. In his evidence in chief, he did not identify his assailant; however,

during cross-examination, he stated that the Deceased and his relatives had assaulted him.

The Accused did successfully establish that animosity existed between him and the Deceased

prior to the incident.

The court found no infirmities in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. However,

based on the observations made regarding the defense of alibi raised by the Accused, the

court has rejected this defense on the grounds that it appears to be a mere afterthought. The

failure to suggest this to the prosecution witness was dealt, in the case of Gunasiri,

Jayarathna Silva, Gnanasiri v. Republic of Sri Lanka 2009 (1) SLR 39 at page 46, Sisira de

Abrew, J held that;

Although the 3rd accused appellant raised an alibi in his dock statement, he failed to

suggest this position to prosecution witnesses. The learned Counsel who appeared for the

defence did not suggest to the prosecution witnesses the alibi raised by the 3rd accused

appellant. What is the effect of such silence on the part of the counsel. In this connection I

Page 9 of 9

would like to consider certain judicial decisions. In the case of Sarwan Singh vs. State of

Punjab at 3656 Indian Supreme Court held thus: "It is a rule of essential justice that

whenever the opponent has declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in

cross examination it must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be

accepted." This judgment was cited with approval in Bobby Mathew vs. State of Kamataka.

On the perusal of evidence led before the Learned Trial Judge, the Learned Trial

Judge has correctly analysed and evaluated the evidence and arrived that the Accused had

committed the offence. Furthermore, we observe that the Learned Trial Judge had correctly

rejected the evidence of the Accused.

For the aforementioned reasons, I find that there is no merit in this appeal.

Accordingly, I uphold the judgment, conviction, and sentence of the Learned Trial Judge.

Therefore, this appeal is dismissed as devoid of merit.
