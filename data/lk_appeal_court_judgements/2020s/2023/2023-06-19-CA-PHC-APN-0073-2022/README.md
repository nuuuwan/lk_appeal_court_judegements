JUDGMENT

P.Kumararatnam,J.

The Petitioner had applied for bail for him in the High Court of

Panadura in the case bearing No. HCBA 158/2021. After an inquiry,

the Learned High Court Judge had refused bail on 21.01.2022.

Aggrieved by the said order, the Petitioner had filed this Revision

Application to revise the said order.

On 24.02.2021, upon receiving an information, the Petitioner was

arrested by officers attached to Panadura Walana Anti-Corruption Unit

and recovered a parcel from the vehicle which is belonging to Sri Lanka

Army. The Petitioner was travelling in the vehicle along with the driver

of the vehicle. Two travelling bags were recovered in the vehicle. Inside

the travelling bag several parcels had been detected. The parcels

contained some substances which reacted for Heroin

(Diacetylmorphine). The substance weighed about 45 Kg and 368

grams. The police also taken into their custody the vehicle bearing

Army No.51556. The driver was also arrested from the vehicle.

The Petitioner and other person were produced and facts were reported

to the Horana Magistrate under Section 54A (b) and (d) of the Poisons,

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13

of 1984.

The production had been sent to the Government Analyst Department

on 21/03/2021. After analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded

the report to Court on 04/10/2021. According to the Government

CA PHC APN 73/2022

4 | P a g e

Analyst, 31 Kg and 26.04 grams of pure Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) had

been detected from the substance sent for the analysis. The Petitioner

had been indicted before the High Court of Panadura.

No special circumstances pleaded in the Petition by the Petitioner. The

only reason adduced is that the granting of bail to 6th and 7th Suspects

arrested in this case before being indicted.

One of the preliminary objections taken up by the State is that the

Petitioner has failed to establish an acceptable exceptional

circumstance to invoke revisionary jurisdiction of this Court.

Next, the State pleads that this matter should be dismissed in limine as

no valid reason had been explained by the Petitioner for his delay.

The Learned State Counsel submitted that the delay is not an

exceptional circumstance to be considered to enlarge the Petitioner on

bail. Further, the time spent for preparing the indictment does not

constitute an exceptional circumstance. According to the State, the

Petitioner had been indicted under AG reference No.CR3/74/2022 in

the High Court of Panadura.

The Petitioner is in remand for more than two years.

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what

is exceptional circumstances must be considered on its own facts and

circumstances on a case by case.

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

CA PHC APN 73/2022

The Section 83 of the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act

which was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states:

83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under

sections 54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail

by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 84 and 85, a person

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A

and section 54B-

(a) of which the pure quantity of the dangerous drug, trafficked,

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A;

and

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment, shall not

be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in exceptional

circumstances.

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in

exceptional circumstances.

In this case the pure quantity of Heroin detected in the production by

the Government Analyst is 31 Kg 26.04 grams. Hence, this court has

jurisdiction to consider granting of bail as per the new amendment.

According to the Learned High Court Judge, the sole reason for

rejection of bail to the Petitioner is non submission of exceptional

circumstances by the Petitioner.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner urged this Court to

consider that the that detaining a suspect without any legal action for

an extended period of time amounts to a violation of his fundamental

rights which can be considered as an exceptional ground.

CA PHC APN 73/2022

The Learned Presidents Counsel submitted that the Petitioner was only

a passenger when the parcel was detected in the vehicle. As another

person was also travelled in the vehicle, he cannot be charged jointly for

the contraband recovered from the vehicle.

The factual and evidentiary matters pertain to the investigations can

only be tested at the trial upon the witnesses being cross examined and

shall not be tested at the time of hearing this bail application

considering the nature of this case.

In this case the detection was done on 24.02.2021 and the Government

Analyst Report was received by the Police Narcotic Bureau on 17.11.

2021.The Hon. Attorney General has already dispatched the indictment

against the Petitioner to the High Court of Panadura.

Further, I do not consider the delay more than two years in remand

falls into the category of excessive and oppressive delay considering the

circumstances of this case.

The Offence under Section 54A(b) and (d) of the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is a

serious offence and the seriousness of the offence should be considered

when bail is considered.

In Ranil Charuka Kulatunga v. Attorney General CA (PHC) APN

134/2015 the court held that:

The quantity of cocaine involved in this case is 62.847

grams, which is a commercial quantity. If Petitioner is

convicted, the punishment is death or life imprisonment.

Under these circumstances, it is prudent to conclude the trial

early while the Petitioner is kept in custody..

In this case the pure Heroin detected is 31 Kg and 26.04 grams, which

certainly a very high commercial quantity. Considering the seriousness

of the sentence prescribed under the Poison, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance, there is a high risk of absconding. Hence, it is

CA PHC APN 73/2022

7 | P a g e

prudent to conclude the High Court case expeditiously keeping the

Petitioner in remand.

Considering all these factors into account, especially the pure quantity

of Heroin detected, the charge in the indictment against the Petitioner

and other circumstances of the case, I consider this is not an

appropriate case in which to interfere with the order of the Learned

High Court Judge of Panadura dated 21.01.2022. Hence, I refuse to

release the Petitioner on bail.

Hence, the revision application is hereby dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this Judgment

to the High Court of Panadura and Officer-in-Charge of the Police

Narcotics Bureau, Colombo-01.
