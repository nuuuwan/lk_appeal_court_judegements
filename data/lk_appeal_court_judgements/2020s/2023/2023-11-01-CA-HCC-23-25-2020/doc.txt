Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as Accused) were Indicted before

the High Court of Kalutara under Section 296 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code for

committing the murder of Sarath Chandrasena (hereinafter referred to as the Deceased )

on the 23rd of September 2001.

The Prosecution led evidence of nine witnesses and marked documents P1 to P7.

After the conclusion of the Prosecution case, the Accused made dock statements.

After the trial, the Learned High Court Judge convicted all three Accused for murder and

imposed the death sentence.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction the Accused have appealed to this court.

Page 3 of 9

Despite having presented multiple grounds of Appeal in their written submission,

learned counsel for the Accused limited their arguments to the following grounds of

Appeal.

1. Has there been a proper exercise of discretion when the learned High Court

Judge who delivered the Judgement decided to adopt the evidence led before

his predecessors?

2. Has the prosecution proved the identity of the Accused beyond reasonable

doubt?

3. Whether circumstantial evidence was sufficient to establish the guilt of the

Accused?

Following are the facts and circumstances of this case;

The Prosecution's case primarily relies on the "last seen" theory. According to

Kahatapitiya Gamage Subarathne Bandara (PW01), he visited the Baduruliya market in

the morning, where he encountered Chanaka, who instructed him to inform 'Kade malli"

alias Sarath (the deceased) not to come to the market, as he was to be assaulted.

Since the deceased was not visible, PW01 walked towards Kalawana and spotted

the deceased on the footboard of a bus heading toward the market. Upon seeing PW01,

the deceased disembarked from the bus. Upon hearing the witness's news, both of them

boarded a bus bound for Kalawana.

When the bus reached Athwelthota Bridge, PW01 observed four individuals

boarding the bus. He identified three of them by their names: Neel, Dammika, and

Gamini, as they were vendors at the aforementioned market. The deceased had forcibly

taken a stall from them and handed it over to PW01. This suggests that these Accused

individuals were not strangers to the Witness or the deceased. Subsequently, the 3rd

Accused approached Sarath and informed him that there was a matter to discuss, after

which he physically pulled him aside.

.

Meanwhile, the 2nd Accused brandished a manna knife in an attempt to stab the

deceased, but another passenger intervened, wresting the knife from the said Accused's

grasp. All three Accused then collectively removed the deceased from the bus, placing him

inside a nearby parked lorry. It's worth noting that PW01 identified this lorry, as it was

frequently used for transporting goods to the aforementioned market.

As they escorted the deceased away from the bus, the Accused informed the

passengers that they were taking him to the police due to his alleged involvement in a

stabbing incident at the Baduruliya Market. Consequently, the passengers refrained from

intervening in the abduction.

.

Upon witnessing the deceased being taken away from the bus, PW01 promptly

approached the driver and reported the incident. The driver then instructed the witness

to disembark near the Kalawana Police Station to file a complaint and handed over the

knife that had been given to him by one of the passengers. Thereafter, he accompanied

the deceased's mother to the Police station to lodge the complaint. It was there that they

were informed about a body found in the Mohomodian estate, and they proceeded to that

location to identify the deceased. According to PW01, the last sighting of the deceased was

around 9-11 a.m.

PW03, the bus driver in question, stated that although he had an unclear

recollection of the incident, he recalled a passenger informing him about the events inside

the bus and advised that passenger to report the matter to the police. Moreover, he

mentioned that this passenger alighted near the Kalawana Police station. Based on this

testimony, the court can reasonably conclude that PW01's account remained consistent.

According to the JMO, Dr. Palitha Dharmabandu Kapparage (PW11), the

estimated time of death was approximately 11 a.m.

On page 175 of the Appeal brief:

:2001.09.23 . 11.00 .

The postmortem examination was conducted on September 24, 2001, at 11:30 a.m.,

during which the JMO identified 8 injuries on the body, with injuries 3 to 7 located in the

head and neck region. Notably, the 3rd and 4th injuries to the brain were deemed fatal.

The JMO also identified no defensive injuries, and the signs of death aligned with the

time recorded in the postmortem report.

Upon reviewing the Judgment, the Learned Trial Judge concluded the guilt of the

Accused based on the "last seen" theory. After scrutinizing the evidence presented by

PW01, there appears to be no reason to doubt his credibility. From PW01's testimony, it

can be inferred that the Accused forcibly took the deceased. According to his account, all

three Accused individuals approached him, displayed a knife, issued threats, and

subsequently took the deceased with them. Importantly, this incident occurred during

daylight and took place on public transport. The discovery of the deceased's body shortly

thereafter and the existence of prior enmity between the deceased and the Accused further

support this conclusion. Additionally, the JMO's assessment placed the time of death at

11:00 a.m.

The last seen theory was considered in the following Judgements,

In the case of State of Uttar Pradesh v Satish [AIR 2005 SC 1000] by Ajith Pasayat J,

"The last seen theory comes into play where the time gap between the point of time

when the Accused and the deceased were seen last alive and when the deceased is found

dead is so small that possibility of any person other than the Accused being the author of

the crime becomes impossible."

This proposition was followed by Justice S.B, Sinha, J in Remreddy Rajeshkhanna

Reddy v State of Andhra Pradesh AIR 2006 SC (2) 1656 held that;

The last-seen theory, furthermore, comes into play where the time gap between the

point of time when the accused and the deceased were last seen alive and the deceased is

Page 6 of 9

found dead is so small that possibility of any person other than the accused being the

author of the crime becomes impossible. Even in such a case Courts should look for some

corroboration.

Considering the facts presented and the aforementioned judgments, the short time

gap between the last known sighting of the Accused and the deceased (between 9-11 a.m.)

and the discovery of the deceased's body around 11 a.m. in close proximity leaves little

room for doubt. When all these circumstances are taken into account, it becomes highly

improbable that anyone other than the Accused could be the perpetrator of this crime.

In light of the incriminating evidence presented by the Prosecution, it begs the

question: What explanation, if any, did the Accused offer in response to this incriminating

evidence?

All three Accused individuals provided dock statements, as detailed on pages 209

and 210 of the Appeal brief.

They merely denied the charge.

I would like to refer to the sentiments referred by Justice F.N.D Jayasuriya along

with Justice P.H.K Kulathilaka J in the case Thalpe Liyanage Manatunga v. Attorney

General, CA No.47/98, decided on 25.08.1999, held that;

The question arises on an evaluation and analysis of the dock statement

whether the accused has attempted to explain away the incriminating circumstances

elicited against him and the prima facie case established by the prosecution by explaining

away those circumstances and stating that there was only an insertion of the male organ

Page 7 of 9

into her legs and not into the private part of the virtual complainant. If such, a fact took

place and existed, it was within the power of the accused to come out with that explanation

and to refute the charge of rape. Though the accused made a dock statement he has failed

to explain away the incriminating circumstances and prima facie case established against

him by indulging in any such explanation. Then as wise and prudent judges often observe

in those circumstances both common sense and logic induce any Court to come to the

conclusion that the accused did not come out with such an explanation because such

circumstances never existed. The accused in his utterly deficient dock statement has

merely stated thus. . .

. That is the bare and the deficient dock statement made by

the accused. In view of the deficiency in the dock statement, this Court is entitled to draw

the presumptions and inferences arising from such a deficiency in terms of the speeches

of Lord Ellenborough in Rex v. Cochrane-Gurneys Reports 479 and of Justice Abbott in

Rex v. Burdet (1820 4 Band Alderman 95 at 120).

In the present case, the evidence indicates that all three Accused individuals

boarded the bus, brandished a manna knife, issued death threats, and forcibly removed

the deceased during broad daylight, within a crowded bus where members of the public

were witnesses. Shortly after this incident, the discovery of the deceased's body occurred,

and the Accused failed to provide any explanation for the incriminating evidence.

Considering the evidence presented, it becomes evident that the only conclusive

and inescapable inference the court can draw is that all three Accused were responsible

for the murder of the deceased individual.

The next question that arises is when the proceedings move forward, the Trial

Judge should issue a comprehensive judicial order. This question was considered by

Justice, S. Thurairaja PC, J in The Attorney General v. Daradadagamage Chandraratne,

CA/85/2013, Decided on 25.05.2018,

He held that,As per the above section the law requires the adoption of proceedings

by the Judge who is succeeding the previous. When the Judge takes the decision to adopt

the proceedings, that decision need not be explained in detail. We cannot expect the trial

Judges to give lengthy reasons and explanations on each and every decision taken in a

trial proceeding. practically it is impossible. When he writes a judgment, he is expected

to give reasons.

Page 8 of 9

Upon reviewing the journal entries and the proceedings, it is evident that both

Judges who succeeded have formally adopted the proceedings. The proceedings dated

2018.10.03 and 2019.03.26 are as follows,

.

.

.

It is our considered view that formal adoption suffices, and there is no expectation

for the Judge to provide reasons. Consequently, this ground of appeal also lacks merit.

During the argument stage, learned counsel for the 3rd Accused pointed out that

the last-seen theory traditionally applies to a single Accused. He further stated that he

could not find any authority addressing cases with multiple Accused individuals. In

response to this objection, learned Deputy Solicitor General Sudharshan De Silva

submitted a Judgment that addresses cases involving several Accused.

Namely Ambagahawattage Sarath Fernando v. AG, CA 270/2012, Decided on

12.02.2014, Sisira J, (Acting P/CA) De Abrew, J held,

According to the prosecution case, the two Accused after discussing a hire to

Hakmana went in the three-wheeler driven by the deceased person. The deceased persons

body was later found in highly decomposed position. The deceased person never returned

to the three-wheeler park. Later the said three-wheeler was found in Matale and the 1st

Accused who went with the 2nd Accused claimed the ownership of the three-

wheeler. What is the explanation given by the Accused-appellant to the above

incriminating evidence?

We observed that the Learned High Court Judge has enumerated various pieces

of circumstantial evidence presented before him to reach the verdict. Keeping in mind the

observations made by S. Ratnavil Pandian, J. in Padala Veera Reddy v. State of A.P. and

Ors. AIR (1990) SC 79, it was established that in cases relying on circumstantial evidence,

such evidence must meet the following criteria:

(1) The circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn, must be

cogently and firmly established,

(2) Those circumstances. should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards

guilt of the Accused.

Page 9 of 9

(3) The circumstances. taken cumulatively should from a chain so complete that there

is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability, the crime was

committed by the Accused and none else, and

(4) The circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete and

incapable of explanation of any. other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the

Accused and such evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the

Accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence

Upon analyzing the evidence presented to the Court, the defense failed to highlight

any contradictions or discrepancies, leaving no room for them to challenge or question the

veracity of PW01's testimony. The consistency of PW01's account, along with

corroboration from the testimonies of other prosecution witnesses, had a significant

impact on the Learned High Court Judge's accurate assessment and acceptance of this

crucial evidence in this case. In my opinion, the prosecution witnesses have maintained

consistency and truthfulness in their testimonies, making this evidence central to the

case.

Therefore, I hold that the one and only irresistible and inescapable inference that

the court can arrive at is that all three Accused Appellants committed the murder of the

deceased Sarath Chandrasena.

For the above reasons, we affirm the conviction and the sentence. Therefore, we

dismiss the Appeal.
