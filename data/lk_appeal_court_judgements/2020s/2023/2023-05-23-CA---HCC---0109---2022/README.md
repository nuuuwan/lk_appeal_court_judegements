MENAKAWIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeal has been lodged to set aside the judgment dated

22.5.2022 of the High Court of Badulla.

The accused appellant in the instant matter was indicted for three counts

under section 365B(2) of the penal code and the appellant had pleaded not

guilty to the indictment and upon concluding the trial the learned trial

judge had convicted the appellant for the first and the second charges.

The prosecution had led the evidence of the victim the mother of the victim

the doctor and the investigative officers.

The grounds of appeal had been,

1) The indictment being contrary to section 165 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Code, (hereinafter referred to as the CPC)

2) The appellant being denied a fair trial,

3) The evidence of PW1 not being considered fairly,

Page 3 of 8

4) The dock statement being rejected for the wrong reasons.

According to the narration of the victim he had been born on 8.6.2001 and

had studied up to the 11thgrade, and he says that he was sexually abused

by the appellant on his birthday month which is the month of June and the

date is the 8th but he does not speak to the year. But according to him this

had taken place on four occasions. But he had not told any person but the

appellant himself had sent anonymous letters to his school when he had

not been a willing partner, stating that he was of bad character and the

health teacher had asked him and he had admitted and the teacher had

told the mother and then the victim and the mother had complained to the

police in the month of August in 2016, which means after a lapse of four

months. He had further said in evidence that he had been renumerated by

the appellant.

He had further said that he was examined by a doctor but to the doctor

he had not told anything according to him. But the doctor speaks of a case

history. The alleged letter sent by the appellant to the school had been

lengthily referred to by the appellant but the letter had not been marked

in evidence and the teacher who had received the letter had not been

called to give evidence by the prosecution which this Court sees as lacuna

in the case of the prosecution.

The defense had suggested to him that he had been asking for money

from the appellant, the victim had not denied the transfer of money

between the two parties, therefore the question arises as to the

creditworthiness of the witness.

The doctor who had examined the victim had given evidence and

according to her the victim had been examined and the history recorded

on 8.6.2016 but according to the victim as mentioned above he had not

given a case history to the doctor hence there is a contradiction between

the doctor and the victim but according to the doctor the first incident

had taken place on 2016.6.8 but whereas according to the indictment the

period referred to begins in 2015 .6.8 to 2016.8.6 which again is contrary

to medical evidence and other evidence it runs more than to 12 months

which is contrary to provisions in the CPC.

The mother who had been called to give evidence also refers to the date of

the incident as being on 8.6.2016 and not in 2015, and the mother says that

she noticed a difference in the behavior of the victim and then she

questioned him but according to the victim it is the teacher who had told

her about the incident, which creates a yet another discrepancy in the

prosecution evidence.

The prosecution has led the evidence of the investigative officers and had

closed the case for the prosecution.

The defense had been called and the appellant had made a dock statement

and he had denied the whole allegation and he had said that an incident in

the nature of the allegation could not have happened in his house because

it is always frequented by his children. He had said that he had been falsely

implicated because there had been an issue with the victims mother

regarding some water supply. The trial judge had rejected the dock

statement on the basis that it only substantiates the version of the

prosecution.

The main ground of appeal by the appellant is that the charge in the

indictment is in violation of section 165 of the CPC. The said section is as

below,

The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of the

alleged offence and as to the person against whom and as to the thing in

respect of which it was committed are reasonably sufficient to give the

accused notice of the matter with which he is charged with and to show

that the offence is not prescribed.

Therefore from the above it is very clear that the particulars in the charge is

very important for the accused to understand the charge which has been

levelled against him and the specific time is also very important for another

additional reason as for the accused person to understand that the offence

with which he has been charged with is not prescribed, and when a time

period is given the accused is unable to do that and anyway if he takes up

the defense of an alibi he is unable to do so when he does not know the

exact date on which he had been charged with. But of course, the CPC has

made one exception under subsection 2 of section 165 in which the time

and the quantity can be stated in gross sums in offences of criminal breach

of trust and criminal misapropriation. But in the instant matter it is a sexual

offence and the definite date is important for the accused to formulate his

defense.

The trial judge had justified the instant matter by quoting section 174 of

the CPC which this Court is of the opinion that it has no bearing for the

instant matter because it refers to matters in which charges can be joined

which has been committed within the span of one year and to be tried in

one indictment.

The instant position has been discussed well in the judgment by

Thurauraja J in the case of KamburawelaKankanamlageDayaratne Vs AG

CA-188-2015 decided on 22.9.2017 in which it has been decided that

As per our constitution the accused is entitled for a fair trial, especially

when there is a criminal prosecution the charge which includes the time

and the place should be clearly informed to the accused together with the

relevant law.

This stance was confirmed and affirmed over and over again by Superior

Courts even the Privy Council.

In the case of Attorney General Vs. VirajAponso and Others S.C. 24/2008,

the Supreme Court had given a guideline for a fair trial. Reading the

guidelines, it is clear that it is the responsibility of the prosecutor to

inform the time, place and the offence clearly to the person who is

charged. It is fundamental for the accused appellant to formulate his

defence.

In this case if the accused wants to take up a defense of alibi he cannot

there is no date or time given. That takes the prosecution for not fulfilling

the fundamental obligation namely fair trial. In R.H.M.S. Premathunga alias

Ananda Vs. Attorney General CA 01/2013 decided on 31/01/2014

whareSisira J de Abrew, J held,

is to give sufficient opportunity to the accused to answer the charge

and ensure a fair trial.

But in the case of CA-WRIT-410-2020 decided on 23.3.2023 Lafar J had

taken a contrary view in a similar matter where he had said that in the

Page 7 of 8

instant case, there are no material/strong prima facie evidence to show

that the particulars as to the time of the offence given as a date

range, have caused any prejudice to the Petitioner.

In the instant matter we are of the opinion that the indictment not being

specific on its date of offence has deprived the appellants right for a fair

trial as per the judgment of Justice Thurairaja mentioned above.

Furthermore, we note that the time period mentioned in the indictment

is more than one year which is in violation of section 174(1) of the CPC

which reads as follows,

174. (1) When a person is accused of more offences than one of the

same kind committed within the space of twelve months from first to the

last of such offences he may be charged with and tried at one trial for any

number of them not exceeding three, and in trials before the High Court

such charges may be included in one and the same indictment.

Furthermore section 165of the CPC has mentioned very clearly that one

of the purposes of stating the time is for the accused to know that the

offence he has been charged with is not prescribed.

Hence in the instant indictment the time period has been specified to be

from 2015 .6.8. to 2016.8.9 which had never been corrected at any stage

of the trial which in the opinion of this Court is a clear violation of section

174(1) of the CPC. The learned trial judge had tried to justify the same

quoting the evidence, but the charge in the indictment has to be specific

and clear for the accused to formulate his defense or else as stated in the

Constitution it is a denial of his right to a fair trial.

As such we hold that there is definitely merit in the first ground of appeal

by the appellant which is sufficient to set aside the impugned judgment.

Be that as it may when Court considers the evidence in entirety there are

many discrepancies which go to the root of the case which definitely

creates a reasonable doubt in the case for the prosecution. As such there

is more than one reason to set aside the impugned judgement and allow

the impugned appeal.

As such the instant appeal is allowed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
