The deceased Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner)

made an application to prove a purported Last Will (hereinafter referred to as

the Will) of the late Henry Wilson Dahanayake and to obtain letters of

administration.

The purported Will was dated 10th August 1960. The application for Proof of

Will was filed on 19th November 1991.

The case was taken up for inquiry on the 5th of June 1996. Nine admissions

were recorded and seven issues were raised by the petitioner. Issue nos. 8

and 9 were raised by the respondents.

As per the admissions, the following facts were admitted by the parties;

1. Wilson Dahanayake died on 15th June 1964.

2. Wilson Dahanayakes heirs were his Wife Nellie and daughters

Mangala, Ranjani, Devika and Indra.

3. Mangala died on 2nd January 1991, leaving her husband the petitioner

and the children.

4. Nellie, the wife of Wilson Dahanayake, died on 20th June 1991.

In the inquiry, only the Petitioner gave evidence in Court and produced

documents marked P1 to P10. The respondents did not call any witnesses.

After the inquiry, the learned Additional District Judge of Galle pronounced

the order on 24th June 1999, rejecting the application of the petitioner.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner-appellant preferred this

appeal.

On behalf of the Appellant, following issues were raised.

:- .

--------------------- 01. 2 . . . 1960.3.10 1995 , ? 02. , ? 03. ? 04. 1991.1.2. 7 ? 05. 2 1995 , ? 06. ? 07. , ? Issue number 1 was answered in the negative.

Issue number 1 is to the following effect.

Was, the last will dated 10/03/1960 attested by M.L.N. Wickramasinghe

Notary Public, referred to in para 2 of the petition, the Last Will of Wilson

Dahanayake?

The Petitioner admitted that his father-in-law Henry Wilson Dahanayake

died in 1964, and the purported Will was found in 1966. The application

was filed by the petitioner in 1991, that is, 27 years after the death of Wilson

Dahanayake. The evidence revealed that the wife of Wilson Dahanayake

6

and his daughters had acted on the basis that there was no Last Will left by

Wilson Dahanayake.

The evidence of the Petitioner is that his wife Mangala told him that there

was a Last Will written by her father in 1966. The wife of Wilson

Dahanayake had disposed of certain properties inherited by her from her

husband on the basis that there was no Last Will. The petitioner and his

wife, most of the time, lived under the same roof with Nellie Dahanayake and

had not objected to such disposal of property by Nellie Dahanayake.

The petitioner stated that he married Mangala in 1962. The petitioner also

admitted that he mostly lived in Galle except for two or three years. The

petitioner had served as a Clerk in the Health Department. He had also

served as a record keeper in the Magistrates Court in Galle for about one

year in 1980. He also admitted that he knew many Lawyers in Galle.

As per the purported Will, the wife of the petitioner, Mangala, was nominated

as the executrix of the Will. Mangala never filed an action to prove a Will.

She died in 1991.

Two subscribing witnesses and the attesting Notary were not among the

living by the time the petitioner filed this action.

The Learned District Judge found that the explanation given by the

petitioner for the delay of 27 years was not acceptable at all. Naturally,

suspicion arises as to why the Petitioner knowing that there was a Will in

1966, waited until1991 to file an action to prove the Will.

The burden of proof in regard to the due execution is on the petitioner. The

petitioner must produce evidence to prove that the purported Will was an act

and deed of the deceased Wilson Dahanayake. The Petitioner had not seen

the execution of the Will. He did not state that he had ever seen his father-

in-law signing any documents. The petitioner did not call any witnesses to

7

prove that the signature in the Will is the signature of the late Wilson

Dahanayake. Thus, the signature in the Will was not proved.

Bertram CJ in the Alims Will case 20NLR 481 stated as follows at pages

493/494

Before proceeding to an analysis of the evidence, I would state briefly what I

understand to be the law upon the subject. It has been established by a long

series of decisions, the most important of which are Barry v. Butlin,1 Baker v.

Butt," Fulton v. Andrew, Tyrrell vs Painton1 (see also Orion v. Smith, Dufour v.

Croft, Wilson vs Basil, Sukhir v. Kadar Nath) that wherever a will is prepared

and executed under circumstances which arouse the suspicion of the Court, it

ought not to pronounce in favour of it unless the party propounding it adduces

evidence which would remove such suspicion, and satisfies the Court that the

testator knew and approved of the contents of the instrument. It is now settled

that this principle is not limited to cases in which the will is propounded by a

person who takes a special benefit under it and himself procured or conducted

its execution. It may very well be that a refusal to grant probate in such a case

may involve an imputation of fraud upon the party propounding the will. This

is no objection to the operations of that principle. (See Baker v. Butt (supra).)

The Court is not necessarily bound to give a decision upon the truth or

falsehood of the conflicting evidence adduced before it upon the question of

fraud. What it has to ask itself is whether, in all the circumstances of the case,

it will give credit to the subscribing witnesses or the other witnesses adduced

to prove the execution. Nor is it an objection to the operation of this principle

that the evidence which casts suspicion on the will, though it suggests fraud,

is not of such a nature as to justify the Court in a finding of fraud. (See Tyrrell

v Painton) The principle does not mean that in cases where a suspicion

attaches to a will, a special measure of proof or a particular species of proof is

required. (See Barry v. Butlin (supra).) It means that in such cases, the Court

must be " vigilant and jealous in examining the evidence in support of the

instrument, in favour of which it ought not to pronounce unless the suspicion is

removed, and it is judicially satisfied that the paper propounded' does express

the true will of the deceased." There are two forcible expressions used in the

8

cases which emphasize this principle. One is, that it is the duty of the party

propounding "the will " to satisfy the conscience of the Court "; and the other

is, that the onus lies upon that party " of showing the righteousness of the

transaction." The law is summed up by Davey L. J. in Tyrell v. Painton (supra)

as follows: " The question appears to me to be whether the learned Judge

applied his mind to the right issue. If the case had been tried by a jury, and he

had directed them that what they had to try was whether Tyrrell had made

out to their satisfaction that the will of November 9 was obtained by fraud, I

should have said that this was a misdirection. There rests upon that will a

suspicion which must be removed before you come to the plea of fraud- It must

not be supposed that the principle in Barry v. Butlinis confined to cases where

the person who prepares the will is the person who takes the benefit under it:

that is one state of things which raises a suspicion; but the principle is that

wherever a will is prepared under circumstances which raise a well-grounded

suspicion that it does not express the mind of the testator, the Court ought not

to pronounce in favour of it unless that suspicion is removed. Here the

circumstances were most suspicious, and the question a Judge has to ask

himself is whether the defendants have discharged themselves of the onus of

showing the righteousness of the transaction and, without going again over

the circumstances which have been referred to, I am compelled to say that

they have not. "

It was argued for the appellant that as the document is prima-facie more

than thirty years old, the Court could presume that the document was duly

executed. The appellant relied on the case of Silva vs Soyza 7NLR 360, where

it was held that Where a will is found in the custody of the testator's widow

and such custody has a legitimate origin, the Court should presume in favour

of its genuineness, even if the best and most proper custodian of the will is the

Court itself.

In the same case, Thomas de Sampayo J held, I am of the same opinion. The

word " document " as defined in the Evidence Ordinance is large enough to

include a will and therefore the presumption created by section 90 applies to

9

the case of a will thirty years old. The corresponding section of the Indian

Evidence Act appears to have been construed in the same way in the Indian

Courts. Mukkerji v. Pal Sritiratna, I.L.R. 5, Cal. 886. It has, however, been held

in India, and I think rightly, that the presumption should generally be drawn

with caution, and there should be at least some evidence of transactions or

states of affairs necessarily or at least naturally referable to it so as to free it

from the suspicion of being fabricated. (See Prasad Bai v. Chandra Bai, 6 W.

R. 82; Dishit Moro v. Lahshman, I. L. R. II., Bom. 89.) In this case evidence of

execution is not absolutely wanting, for the widow of the deceased swears to

his having signed it. Further, transactions of the kind referred to are also

shown to have taken place, as it appears that the widow and the children who

were beneficiaries under the will sold some of the property of the estate, and

the vendees have been in undisturbed possession for a great many years

without opposition from the respondents to this appeal, who are the children of

the widow by a marriage contracted subsequently to the death of the first

husband, the deceased testator. I therefore think that the requirements in the

proof of a will of an ancient date have been sufficiently fulfilled, including the

necessity for the document to come from proper custody.

In this case, according to the purported Will, the wife of the appellant had

been appointed as the executrix of the Will. As per the evidence of the

appellant, the executrix had found the Will in 1966. she died in 1991. The

wife of the appellant never filed an action to prove the Will. If P 3 is the Last

Will of her late father and the Will is more beneficial to her, an issue arises

as to why she had not filed an action to prove the Will. This is one of the

suspicions the appellant should have removed.

In the case of Samarakone v The Public Trustee 65NLR 100 it was held as

follows;

(iv) that where there are features which excite suspicion in regard to a will,

whatever their nature may be, it is for those who propound it to remove such

10

suspicion. Suspicious features may be a ground for refusing probate even

where the evidence which casts suspicion on the will, though it suggests

fraud, is not of such a nature as to justify the Court in arriving at a definite

finding of fraud. The conscience of the Court must be satisfied in respect of

such matters.

The petitioner stated that his wife had handed over the Will to 3 lawyers to

file an action. However, all such lawyers procrastinated and never filed an

action. No particular reason was attributed to the two lawyers for not filing

an action. With regard to the other lawyer, the petitioner stated that his

wifes younger sisters husband was working in that lawyers office as a clerk

who was a retired court interpreter and therefore, he knew that no action

would be filed by that lawyer. However, he had not done anything about

that.

The evidence of the petitioner also reveals that the petitioner himself had

served as a clerk in the District Court of Colombo and the District Court of

Gampola. As such, the petitioner had knowledge about the work in the

District Court. Further, he had served as the record keeper of the

Magistrates Court of Galle and admitted to have known several lawyers

practicing in Galle Bar. The petitioner also admitted in cross-examination

that at the time the purported Will was found, his mother-in-law, the wife of

the testator, the executrix of the Will, his wife, the notary who attested the

Will and the two attesting witnesses all were among the living. To the

question whether he had waited 27 years until all of them were dead to file

this action, the petitioner did not reply. In these circumstances, the

explanation for the delay of 27 years is not satisfactory.

The learned Additional District Judge observed that the petitioner had not

made any attempt to prove the signature in the alleged will to be identified or

to be proved. In this case, there is absolutely no evidence of the execution of

the Will.

11

In the case of Silva vs Soyza 7NLR 360, the application was made by the wife

of the testator and she was the executrix. Further, she had seen and

witnessed the execution of the Will by her husband. As de Sampayo J noted,

there should be at least some evidence of transactions or states of affairs

necessarily or at least naturally referrable to it so as to free it from the

suspicion of being fabricated.

This application was not filed by the executrix. The Will was not produced in

court from the custody of the executrix. The position of the petitioner is that

the executrix had the Will since 1966, but she had not taken any steps to

prove the Will until her death in 1991. The petitioner filed this case in the

same year after the death of the executrix and her mother. There is no

evidence that the wife of the testator had any knowledge about a Last Will by

her husband. Nellie Dahanayake, the wife of Wilson Dahanayake, had

disposed of certain properties inherited by her from her husband on the

basis that there was no Last Will. The petitioner and his wife, who lived most

of the time, under the same roof with Nellie Dahanayake, had not objected to

such disposal of property by Nellie Dahanayake.

The children of the testator also did not have any knowledge about a Last

Will of their father. In this case, there is no evidence at all to support that

the testator had signed the Will or knew about the Will. In the

circumstances, there is no sufficient material to apply the presumption in

section 90 of the Evidence Ordinance to this case.

On behalf of the petitioner, it was submitted that some evidence and

documents that led in the abortive trial proceedings should have been taken

into consideration by the learned Additional District Judge. This submission

cannot be accepted. The evidence or documents in abortive proceedings,

though filed of record, cannot be taken into consideration.

12

Further, it was argued that the answer to issue number six is wrong. When

issue number one was not proved, none of the other issues raised on behalf

of the petitioner can be answered in the affirmative.

It was submitted that the learned Additional District Judge has decided that

since the petitioner has filed this case 20 years after the death of the

testator, the petitioner cannot maintain this action as per the provisions of

section 545 of the Civil Procedure Code. The learned Additional District

Judge has stated that as the 20 years had already lapsed, the deeds

executed were valid, and the petitioners action was defeated by that reason.

Although part of this observation is incorrect, the learned Additional District

Judge has not dismissed the action on this ground. Therefore, any

misdirection regarding section 545 of the Civil Procedure Code did not lead

to the dismissal of the petitioners action.

When considering the evidence of this case, the learned Additional District

Judge is justified in coming to the conclusion that the Will was not proved

to the satisfaction of court.

For the reasons set out above, we hold that there is no reason to interfere

with the order of the learned Additional District Judge dated 24/06/1999.

Therefore, the appeal is dismissed without costs.
