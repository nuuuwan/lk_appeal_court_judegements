This is a revision application against the order dated 21.02.22 delivered by the

learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Western Province holden

in Colombo. The accused-petitioners (hereinafter referred to as the petitioners)

aggrieved by the said impugned order, has preferred this instant revision

application to this Court in order to set aside the said order.

The facts of the case are as follow. The petitioners were the accused of the High

Court of Colombo case bearing no. HCB/32/2017. The Director General of the

Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption framed 14 charges under

Sections 19 (c) read with Section 25 (3) of the Bribery Act and Section 113 (a) of

the Penal Code against the said accused or the petitioners of the instant

application. However, when this matter was fixed for trial on or about

26.08.2019, the 1st accused-petitioner brought up the following preliminary

objections: 1) The sanction given by one Commissioner to commence the

investigation and file charges in court is contrary to law. 2) The case must fail in

ab initio as it has failed to satisfy the law. 3) The Attorney-General cannot appear

on behalf of the Respondent. The aforesaid matters were fixed for argument and

the petitioners filed the written submissions consequently. However, prior to the

matters being taken up for argument, the respondent withdrew the lower court

case filed at the High Court of Colombo which engendered the following revision

applications CA/PHC/APN/16/2020 and CA/PHC/APN/18/2020, thereby

rendering the above applications redundant.

Thereafter the petitioners were indicted for the second time on 29.06.2021 under

the case bearing no. HCB/115/2021, under the same 14 charges framed by the

Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption. Consequently, the petitioners

took up the following preliminary objections on 13.12.2021.

1. The indictment has been served without a proper sanction or the direction

of the Bribery Commission.

2. The indictment served is bad in law.

4

CA-CPA-85-22 Page 4 of 8 04/04/2023 IJ-17-23

3. The Attorney-General has no right to appear on behalf of the Director

General of the Bribery Commission.

The learned Attorney-General filed the counter objections on the 19.01.2022 and

after a perusal of the submissions made by both the parties, the learned High

Court Judge delivered his order dated 21.02.2022 by dismissing the aforesaid

preliminary objections of the petitioners. Therefore, aggrieved by this impugned

order, the petitioners have sought to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this

Court to set aside the said order.

This Court will not take up the third objection which is that the Attorney-General

cannot appear on behalf of the Director General of the Bribery Commission as it

addressed under a separate application bearing no. CA/CPA/77/2022.

In delving into the first two submissions made by the petitioners, it is the

observation of this Court that the major premise on which the above objections

are levelled, is the purported defectiveness in the indictment served. It is the

averment of the petitioners that the indictment is bereft of the proper directive of

the Commission to Investigate Bribery and Corruption (hereinafter referred to as

the Commission), to conduct the investigation proceedings as required by the law.

Therefore, it is the submission of the petitioners that based on the failure to meet

the requirements of the law, the indictment served is erroneous and bad in law.

Although, it is the submission of the respondent that the Director General

instituted the indictment in the High Court with the proper directive by the

Commission and that the full Commission was established by the time such

indictment was instituted, thereby rendering the petitioners submissions futile.

Having setting out the arguments of both the parties, this Court observes that

the petitioners submissions are primarily premised and pivots on the

interpretation of Section 11 of the Act no.19 of 1994 (hereinafter referred to as the

CIABOC Act) which can be reproduced below in the following manner:

Where the material received by the Commission in the course of an

investigation conducted by it under this Act, discloses the commission of an

offence by any person under the Bribery Act or the Declaration of Assets

5

CA-CPA-85-22 Page 5 of 8 04/04/2023 IJ-17-23

and Liabilities Law, No. 1 of 1975, the Commission shall direct the Director-

General to institute criminal proceedings against such person in the

appropriate court and the Director-General shall institute proceedings

accordingly... . (Emphasis added)

The petitioners in further fortifying the above stance has cited the case of

Anoma Polwatte vs Director General, The Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and others SC/Writ Application

No. 01/2011 dated 26.07.2018 where the Supreme Court held that Even

though the Act had not provided a specific provision as to how the directive

should be made, there exists a prerequisite under section 11 of the Act to

obtain a directive when the investigations conducted, disclose the

commission of an offence, before launching any prosecution.

The contention of a requisite of the directive of the Commission and the

implications of the Anoma Polwatta Case (supra) have been well

addressed and ironed out by the Supreme Court in the case of Indiketiya

Hewage Kusumdasa Mahanama v Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020 decided

on 11.01.2023, where the Five Judge Bench of the Supreme Court

presided by His Lordship Justice Malalgoda P.C. resolved the knots in

relation to the interpretation and application of Section 11 of the CIABOC

Act and settled the legal reasoning behind the law and the principles

pertaining to it. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held:

the Supreme Court when deciding Anoma S. Polwatte V.

Director General Commission to Investigate Allegations of

Bribery and Corruption (supra) had never intended to impose

an additional requirement to submit a written directive when

filing charges before Court, and therefore this Court is not

inclined to impose an additional requirement other than the

provisions already identified in Section 12 (I) and (II) of the

CIABOC Act when forwarding an indictment before the High

Court. (at page 43)

6

CA-CPA-85-22 Page 6 of 8 04/04/2023 IJ-17-23

It is evident by the above pronouncement that the Supreme Court did not

intend to impose an additional requirement of attaching a written directive

of the Commission to the indictment but rather required the satisfaction

of the requisites promulgated under Section 12 of the Commission when

filing charges under Section 11 of the CIABOC. Hence, it is the observation

of this Court that the petitioners averment that by virtue of, inter alia, the

Anoma Polwatta Case, the absence of a written directive renders the

indictment, bad in law is without credit and thus cannot be maintained.

The Supreme Court further elaborated that:

As already observed by us, when deciding the above case,

this Court had never intended to impose an additional

requirement of submitting a written directive given by the

Commission when forwarding an indictment by the Director

General CIABOC to High Court other than following the

provisions already identified under Sections 12 (I) and (II) of

the CIABOC Act. If the Director General is directed under

Section 11 of the CIABOC Act by the CIABOC to forward an

indictment, he is only bound to follow the provisions in Section

12 (I) and (II) of the CIABOC Act. In the absence of any

complaint, that the Director General CIABOC had failed to

comply with Sections 12(I) and (II) of the CIABOC Act when

forwarding the indictment before the High Court at Bar it is

correct in refusing the jurisdictional objection raised on behalf

of the 2nd Accused before the High Court at Bar. The Trial

Judge before whom the indictment is filed is therefore bound

to accept the indictment and take up the trial unless there is

material to establish that Director General CIABOC had failed

to comply with the provisions of Sections 12 (1) and (2) of the

CIABOC Act. Any party who intends to challenge an

indictment forwarded by the Director General CIABOC on the

basis that, the CIABOC had failed to comply with Section 11

of the CIABOC Act, the said challenge could only be raised in

7

CA-CPA-85-22 Page 7 of 8 04/04/2023 IJ-17-23

an appropriate action filed before an appropriate forum. (at

page 44)

Therefore, in light of the above pronouncement, this Court rejects the submission

of the Petitioners that the lack of a written directive by the Commission renders

the indictment bad in law.

Furthermore, this Court is of the observation that pertaining to the forum chosen

by the petitioners to address the defectiveness of the indictment, this Court lacks

the jurisdiction to canvass such objections as per the law set out in a plethora of

cases such as the following: Director General of Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption vs Lalith Kumara LTA 06 of 2016 dated

23.02.2022, B.A. Ranjan Somasinghe vs Director General of Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption CPA 02/2022 dated

11.01.2022, D.M. Rohini Ekanayake vs Director General of Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption CA PHC APN 76/21 dated

05.04.2022 and Amarawansha Abeysiri Munasinghe Vs Director General of

Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption CA-HCC-

308/2019 dated 31.01.2023. In the above instances, this Court has repeatedly

established that an act of the Commission has to be challenged by way of writ

application to the Supreme Court as mandated in section 24(1) of CIABOC Act.

This stance was reaffirmed in Kusumdasa Mahanama (supra) which held that:

Any party who intends to challenge an indictment forwarded

by the Director General of CIABOC on the basis that the

CIABOC had failed to comply with section 11 of the CIABOC

Act, the said challenge could only be raised in an appropriate

action filed before an appropriate forum. (At Page 44)

(Emphasis added)

Thus, in the instant application the petitioners cannot raise the objection of the

indictment being defective under Section 11 of CIABOC Act and thereby impugn

the acts of the Commission before the Court of Appeal or before the High Court.

It ought to be canvassed under the writ jurisdiction before the Supreme Court

8

CA-CPA-85-22 Page 8 of 8 04/04/2023 IJ-17-23

under section 24 (1) of the Act. The Court of Appeal or the High Court is not the

proper forum and has no jurisdiction to entertain such objections.

Therefore, it is the view of this Court that with regards to the preliminary

objections of the petitioners, the submission that the lack of a written directive

renders the indictment bad in law cannot be maintained as the Commissions

directive is required in commencing the investigations as per Section 11 of the

CIABOC and an indictment served under Section 11 only requires the fulfillment

of the requisites delineated under Section 12 of the CIABOC as established by

the Supreme Court. Therefore, an additional attachment of a written directive by

the Commission in order to serve an indictment is not intended by the law. As

such, the first submission of the petitioners cannot be maintained. Furthermore,

pertaining to the forum chosen to raise an objection against the defectiveness of

the indictment served is inappropriate as this Court lacks the jurisdiction to

challenge an indictment, such an application must be made by way of a writ

before the Supreme Court as mandated by Section 24 (1) of the CIABOC Act.

Therefore, this Court observes that the learned High Court Judge of Colombo

has correctly dismissed the preliminary objections of the petitioners and thus

affirms the order dated 21.02.2022.

Application dismissed.
