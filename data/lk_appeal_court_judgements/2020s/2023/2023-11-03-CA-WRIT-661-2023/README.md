The primary task of the Court at this stage is to consider whether the material disclosed to

Court demonstrates an arguable case which needs further consideration after issuing formal

notice on the Respondents. Several preliminary objections were raised by the Respondents

who vehemently resisted issuing such formal notice.

The cardinal objection raised by the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) and the learned

Presidents Counsel who appear for the Respondents is that no necessary parties before

Court. The contention of the Respondents is that several other persons who are not party to

Page 3 of 5

the instant Application will be severely affected if this Court grants the reliefs including the

interim relief sought by the Petitioners. Based on such preliminary objections the Respondents

move that this Application be dismissed in limine.

The Petitioners in addition to the substantive reliefs sought in the prayer of the Petition seek

an interim order directing the 1st Respondent - Secretary to the Ministry of Education to stay

the issuance and grant of appointments to the candidates whose names are reflected in the list

of names marked P8. Apparently, the said list of names contains the names of the candidates

who are selected to be appointed to the Sri Lanka Principals Service Grade III, consequent to

a general and structured interview. It appears that such appointments are due to be made by

the 1st Respondent during the forthcoming weekend. It is paramount to note that none of those

candidates who were successful at such interviews have been made parties to the instant

Application.

It is no doubt that the candidates mentioned in the said P8 will be affected if this Court

proceeds to grant an interim relief as prayed for by the Petitioner. Apart from the said interim

relief the attention should be drawn to the contents of the first paragraph of the letter dated

08.05.2023 marked P5by which the Petitioners have been called for an interview. The 1st

Respondent has categorically stated therein that the Petitioners were called for a general and

structured interview in accordance with the Minute of the Sri Lanka Principals Service

(published in Gazette extraordinary 1885/31 on 22.10.2014, marked P1) and also in

reference to a settlement entered into by the parties to the Fundamental Rights Applications

bearing Nos. SC/FR/93/2021, SC/FR/40/2022, SC/FR/26/2022, SC/FR/476/2019.

The Order of the Supreme Court in relation to all the above 4 Applications issued on

12.12.2022 is annexed to the Petition marked P4. The said Order of the Supreme Court

clearly demonstrates that the Petitioners of those Applications have informed Court that they

do not wish to pursue with those Applications based on the undertaking given by the learned

DSG that the respective Respondents would not take any steps as per the Cabinet Decision

dated 01.03.2021 and however, such Respondents would take steps to fill up 4,718 vacancies

(vacancies of the Sri Lanka Principals Service Grade III) that existed as at 30.06.2021 by

calling for interviews of the successful candidates from the examination held on 10.02.2019.

Ironically, the Petitioners in those Fundamental Rights Applications are not party to the

Page 4 of 5

instant Application and this leads no option for me to pronounce that those Petitioners will

be affected if this Court proceeds to grant any of the reliefs prayed for by the Petitioners.

If there is a power to decide and decide detrimentally to the prejudice of a person, duty to act

judicially is implicit in exercise of such power and that the rule of natural justice operates in

areas not covered by any law validly made. Where there is nothing in the statute to actually

prohibit the giving of an opportunity of being heard, the nature of the statutory duty imposed

on the decision-maker itself implies an obligation to hear before deciding (Vide - M.P. Jain &

S.N. Jain 'Principles of Administrative Law' 9th edition 2022 p.386)1. I have no hesitation in

arriving at a finding that the above proposition directly applies to the decision making process

of this Court as well and similarly, it goes to the roots of this case. Hence, I hold that the

necessary parties are not before Court which restricts this Court from a fuller and proper

adjudication of this matter. Morefully, this is not a fit and proper case for his Court to use its

inherent powers to consider the relief sought by the Petitioner even if the necessary parties are

not before Court. There is no averment in the Petition of the Petitioners seeking permission

to add necessary parties in due course owing to any exceptional circumstances.

Furthermore, I am not convinced that there is a substantial question of law which needs

consideration of this Court. The Petitioners primary contention is that the decisions reflected

in P5 to P8 are bad in law as much as no competitive examination as required in the Minute

of the Sri Lanka Principals Service, has been held. It is not disputed that the above-named

Petitioners have sat the limited competitive examination conducted in the year 2018 or 2019

in terms of the said Service Minute for the purpose of these appointments. There is no contrary

evidence to establish that the Petitioners became aware of the fact that a limited competitive

examination 2018/2019 have been held in line with the provisions of the said Service Minute

when the Petitioners received the letter dated 08.05.2023 marked P5. The heading of P5

and its first paragraph speaks itself to that effect. Having sat the competitive examination in

2018 or 2019 and facing the interviews in the month of May 2023, based on the results of the

aforesaid examination, the Petitioners have waited until an ancillary decision, which is

1 Also see: Prakash Ratan Sinha v State of Bihar, (2009) 14 SCC 690,694 (para 13 and 14)

Page 5 of 5

unfavorable to them, was taken by the Respondents to challenge the subject recruitment

process.

Hence, in view of considering the issuance of formal notice, this is a fit case to take into

consideration the conduct of the Petitioners and their acquiescence in respect of the steps

taken at the early stages of the subject recruitment process. In the circumstances, this Court

takes the view that the Petitioners have not made out an arguable case or a prima facie case

for this Court to issue formal notice on the Respondents. We refuse notice and dismiss this

Application as the Petitioners have failed to satisfy the initial threshold requirements which

warrants this Court to issue formal notice of this Application on the Respondents.
