Judgment

The Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station-Akkaraipattu had instituted case bearing

No. 37912/PCA/13 in the Magistrates Court of Akkaraipattu under and in terms of

section 66(1)(a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 as there had

been a dispute affecting land between the Party of the 1st Party Respondents and

Party of the 2nd Party Respondents that had led to a serious breach of peace between

them.

The Magistrates Court had followed the procedure stipulated in section 66 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act and allowed both parties to file affidavits, counter

affidavits and documents followed by written submissions in order to conclude the

inquiry.

On 17.06.2013, the learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge

had delivered the Order declaring that the impugned land in dispute had been under

the management and in possession of 4th - 8th Respondent-Respondent-Respondents

[hereinafter referred to as the 4th,5th,6th,7th,8th Respondents] and that 4th-8th

Respondents are entitled to possession in terms of section 68(3) of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned Magistrate, the 1st named

Respondent-Petitioner of the Party of the 1st Part [hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent-Petitioner], namely Thanganayaki Mahadevan, had invoked the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court in case bearing No.

HC/KAL/REV/95/2013 seeking to have the said Order of the learned Magistrate

revised.

Thereafter, the learned High Court Judge having heard the oral arguments of parties

supported by written submissions had delivered the Order dated 01.04.2015

affirming the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 17.06.2013 and refusing the

application for revision of the said Respondent-Petitioner, Thanganayaki

Mahadevan.

It appears that 2nd named Respondent-Respondent of the Party of the 1st Party

Respondent namely Subair Lafeer, captioned as 2nd Respondent-Respondent-

Page 17 of 22

Appellant [hereinafter referred to as the 2nd Appellant] has preferred this Appeal

bearing Number CA (PHC) 76/2015 (A) against the said Order of the High Court.

The 3rd named Respondent-Respondent of the Party of the 1st Party Respondent

namely, Mohamed Ismail Munasik captioned as 3rd Respondent-Respondent-Appellant

[hereinafter referred to as the 3rd Appellant] has also preferred Appeal bearing No.

CA(PHC) 76/2015(B) against the said Order of the High Court.

The position taken up by the 4th - 8th Respondent-Respondent-Respondents was that

2nd and 3rd Appellants are not entitled to prefer Appeals to the Court of Appeal, since

they have not invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court against the Order

of the learned Magistrate dated 17.06.2013. Thus, the maintainability of the said

appeals preferred by the 2nd and 3rd Appellants was challenged by way of a

preliminary objection. The 3rd ,4th ,5th ,6th ,7th and 8th Respondent-Respondents had

taken up the position that if 2nd and 3rd Appellants were aggrieved by the said Order

of the learned Magistrate, they should have moved in revision to have the said Order

revised by filing separate applications for revision or by joining as parties the

revision application already filed by the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant

[hereinafter referred to as the 1st Appellant] namely, Thanganayaki Mahadevan, in

HC/KAL/REV/95/2013.

In the present case the 2nd and 3rd Appellants had neither filed separate applications

nor named themselves as joint Petitioners in the said revision application filed in

the High Court of Kalmunai by the said 1st Appellant. It is seen that they have slept

over their legal rights, and thereby guilty of laches.

In Gunasekera and Another vs Abdul Latiff [1995 (1) Sri.L.R 1 at page 235], it

was held :

Laches itself means slackness or negligence or neglect to do something which

by law a man is obliged to do. It also means unreasonable delay-in pursuing a

legal remedy whereby a party forfeits the benefit upon the

principle vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveiunt. The neglect to assert

ones rights or the acquiescence in the assertion of adverse rights will have

the effect of barring a person from the remedy which he might have had if he

resorted to it in proper time. When it would be practically unjust to give a

Page 18 of 22

remedy either because the party has by his conduct done that which might

fairly be regarded as equal to waiver of it or where by his conduct and neglect

he has though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a

situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were

to be afterwards asserted, in either of these cases lapse of time and delay

are most material. (At page 341)

In the case of, Liyanage & Another vs Ratnasiri - Divisional Secretary, Gampaha &

Others [2013] 1 SRI.L.R, Supreme court recognized the maxim, Vigilantibus non

dormientibus jura subveniunt, which means law assists only those who are vigilant and

not those who sleep on their rights. It is the responsibility of the individual to be

aware of their rights and to take the necessary steps to protect them. Accordingly,

individuals who are not vigilant in protecting their rights may not be able to rely on

law to assist them.

The 2nd and 3rd Appellants have neither joined the revision application in the High

Court nor initiated their own applications by way of revision. Therefore, 2nd and 3rd

Appellants are guilty of laches and they have slept over their legal rights without

providing a proper explanation for doing so. The 2nd and 3rd Appellants are therefore

not entitled to come before this court now and file an appeal to the Judgement of

the High Court as they have acted as if they waived off their right to proceed with

invoking revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court, which also indicates that they

are satisfied with the decision of the Magistrates court.

Since the learned High Court Judge has affirmed the Order of the learned Magistrate,

if Court of Appeal accepts the appeals made by the 2nd and 3rd Appellants against

the Order of the High Court, it amounts to an appeal preferred against the Order of

the learned Magistrate exercising jurisdiction in terms of section 66 of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act, which does not provide a right of appeal. Hence, it is my

view that 2nd and 3rd Appellants are precluded from filing petitions of appeal against

the Order of the High Court exercising revisionary jurisdiction against the Order

made under Part VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No.44 of 1979.

Therefore, we are not inclined to entertain the appeals made by the 2nd and 3rd

Appellants.

Page 19 of 22

The 1st Appellant namely, Thanganayaki Mahadevan, captioned as Petitioner-

Respondent-Appellant, being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned Magistrate,

had made a revision application to the High Court and had preferred appeal bearing

number CA PHC 76(2015(C) against the Order of the learned High Court Judge that

affirmed the Order made by the learned Magistrate who was acting as a Primary

Court Judge.

Since this appeal emanates from an Order of the learned High Court Judge of the

Provincial High Court of Kalmunai exercising revisionary jurisdiction, the Court of

Appeal is empowered to evaluate the correctness of the exercise of revisionary

jurisdiction by the Provincial High Court and it is not a task before this Court to

consider an appeal against an Order made under and in terms of Section 66 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act.

It was emphasized by Ranjith Silva J. in the case Nandawathi and another Vs.

Mahindasena [(2009) 2 SLR 218];

I am of the opinion that this particular right of appeal in the circumstances

should not be taken as an appeal in the true sense, but in fact as an

application to examine the correctness, legality or the propriety of the Order

made by the High Court Judge in the exercise of revisionary powers. The Court

of Appeal should not under the guise of an appeal attempt to re-hear or re-

evaluate the evidence led in the main case.

It is to be observed that the main reason for the learned High Court Judge to have

dismissed the revision application of the Petitioner-Appellant [1st Appellant] was

that the Petitioner-Appellant [1st Appellant] had not urged exceptional grounds to

have the revisionary jurisdiction by the Provincial High Court exercised. It is trite

law that revisionary powers can be considered and exercised only when there are

exceptional circumstances pleaded by the Petitioner.

The attention of Court was drawn to revision application dated 12th July 2013 filed

in the Provincial High Court of Kalmunai and the only exceptional ground pleaded in

paragraph 33 of the application reads as follows;

33. The above-described error in law and fact by the learned Magistrate of

Akkaraipattu constitute exceptional circumstances which warrant the

Page 20 of 22

intervention of your Lordships Court to set aside the Order of the learned

Magistrate, Akkaraipattu delivered on the 17.06.2013 as the learned

Magistrate has erroneously concluded that 4th to 8th Respondents are entitled

to possess the land in dispute.

It is to be noted that there is no other averment in the revision application of the

Petitioner-Appellants [1st Appellant] pleading or indicating any exceptional

circumstances except for the aforesaid averment. However, the mere existence of

exceptional circumstances itself would not allow this Court to invoke its revisionary

jurisdiction. In order to maintain a revision application, exceptional circumstances

should be precisely and expressly averred in the petition. Thus, the ground

mentioned in paragraph 33 of the application cannot be considered an exceptional

ground to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of High Court.

In Urban Development Authority Vs. Ceylon Entertainments Ltd. CA 1319/2001

Court of Appeal minute dated 05.04.2002 Nanayakkara J. held with Udalagama J.

agreeing,

That presence of exceptional circumstances by itself would not be sufficient

if there is no express pleading to the effect in the petition whenever an

application is made invoking, the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of

Appeal.

Similarly, in Siripala Vs. Lanerolle [2012] 1 SLR 105, Sisira de Abrew J. held that

Even though the Petitioner attempts to justify the recourse to revision in his

written submissions, it is well settled law that existence of such exceptional

circumstances should be amply and clearly demonstrated in the petition

itself.in the instant application, the Petitioner has neither disclosed nor

expressly pleaded exceptional circumstances that warrant intervention by

way of revision.

It was held in the case Athurupana Vs. Premasinghe B.L.R [2004] Vol. X Part II P. 60SC,

Every illegality, impropriety or irregularity does not warrant the exercise of

revisionary jurisdiction but such jurisdiction will be exercised only where the

illegality, impropriety or irregularity in the proceeding has resulted in a

Page 21 of 22

miscarriage of justice by the party affected being denied what is lawfully due

to the party.

Although there is no right of appeal against an Order of a Magistrate acting in the

capacity of a Primary Court Judge exercising jurisdiction in terms of Section 66 of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act, revisionary jurisdiction is permissible in

exceptional circumstances where any injustice or a miscarriage of justice was caused

to a party. The Court of Appeal is not empowered to correct errors made by the

learned Magistrate. However, Court of Appeal has to determine whether the learned

High Court Judge has properly exercised his duty when ascertaining whether any

injustice was caused to a party or whether any miscarriage of justice has occurred

by the Order of the learned Magistrate. By invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of

Court, the aggrieved party can challenge the legality of an Order but not the

correctness of an Order.

It was emphasized by Obeysekara, J. in the case of Aluthhewage Harshani

Chandrika and others Vs. Officer in Charge and others [CA PHC 65/2003- C.A.M.

21.04.2020];

The Court of Appeal has to look into the matter whether the learned High

Court Judge has properly exercised his duty to ascertain any injustice caused

to a party or whether there is a miscarriage of justice occurred against the

Order of the learned Magistrate and not that the Court of Appel is empowered

to correct the errors made by the learned Magistrate.

In the instant case, the learned Magistrate has determined who was in possession of

the disputed land two months prior to the date on which the information was filed

and who is entitled to the possession of the portion of land in dispute. These were

affirmed by the learned High Court Judge. As such, it is seen that 1st Respondent-

Petitioner-Appellant has not established a miscarriage of justice or that a great

injustice was caused to the 1st Appellant by the impugned Order of the learned High

Court Judge.

It was emphasized by Jayasinghe J. in the case of Sunil Chandra Kumara Vs. Veloo

[2001] 3 Sri L R 91 that

Page 22 of 22

Revision is a discretionary remedy; it is not available as of right. This power

that flows from Art. 138 is exercised by the Court of Appeal, on application

made by a party aggrieved or ex mero motu, this power is available even

where there is no right of appeal. The Petitioner in a Revision application only

seeks the indulgence of Court to remedy a miscarriage of justice. He does not

assert it as a right. Revision is available unless it is restricted by the

constitution or any other law".

It was held in the case Bank of Ceylon Vs. Kaleel [2004] (1) SLR 284 :

The Court to exercise revisionary jurisdiction, the Order challenged must

have occasioned failure of justice and manifestly erroneous which goes

beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would

instantly react to it. In other words, the Order complained of is of such nature

which would have shocked the conscience of Court.

The decisions mentioned above emphasize that existence of exceptional

circumstances is a pre-condition for the exercise of revisionary powers. In the instant

case, the Petitioner has not specifically pleaded or established exceptional

circumstances warranting the exercise of revisionary powers.

As 1st Party - 1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant has failed to disclose exceptional

circumstances for the learned High Court Judge to exercise revisionary jurisdiction,

we see no reason to interfere with the Order of the learned High Court Judge dated

01.04.2015 that dismissed the revision application of 1st Respondent-Petitioner (1st

Appellant).

Hence, Appeals bearing No. CA PHC 76/2015(A) and CA PHC 76/2015(B) and CA PHC

76/2015(C) are dismissed with costs fixed at Rs.50,000/- each.

Appeal dismissed.
