Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the registered owner-petitioner-appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the appellant) on the basis of being aggrieved by the

order made by the learned High Court Judge of Negombo on 09-09-2022,

wherein the revision application preferred by her invoking the revisionary

jurisdiction of the High Court was dismissed.

The appellant is the registered owner of the vehicle number 48-0440, the subject

matter of this appeal.

One Nishantha Muthukuda who was the driver of the said vehicle was charged

before the Magistrates Court of Negombo for having committed an offence in

terms of the Forest Ordinance by transporting sawn timber for a value of Rs.

86777.55/- on or about 29-05-2019.

When the charge was read over to the accused, the accused had unconditionally

pleaded guilty to the charge, although the charge had not specified what type of

timber that had been transported to indicate whether it was prohibited to be

transported without a valid permit.

Accordingly, the learned Magistrate of Negombo has sentenced the accused and

has called upon the registered owner of the vehicle to show cause as to why the

vehicle involved should not be confiscated.

Page 5 of 10

The registered owner namely, Jayasooriya Arachchige Dona Mary Josephine

Calista has given evidence at the inquiry held in that regard, and has stated that

she purchased this lorry about 5 years ago and it was her husband who used

the lorry for transportation of cement blocks and other material. It had been her

evidence that since her husband fell ill and could not drive the vehicle anymore,

she handed over the vehicle to Janaka Nishantha who was the accused in this

case with the intention of earning a living out of the vehicle.

She has stated that the said Janaka Nishantha used to give Rs. 25000/- to

30000/- out of the earnings from the vehicle and the vehicle was under his

custody for the purposes of hiring. According to her, she used to get an income

weekly and the said Nishantha used to bring the vehicle once a week on

Saturdays and pay her money from the earnings before taking it back on

Sundays.

She has maintained the position that she, her husband and her brothers used

to be vigilant about the vehicle and used to instruct the driver how he should

utilize the vehicle for hiring purposes. The driver has been using the vehicle for

about three years and there had been no complaints that he used the vehicle for

illegal purposes, but on the day relevant to this incident, they came to know that

the vehicle has been taken into custody while transporting timber.

It had been her position that the vehicle was given to the accused to transport

cement blocks and other similar materials, they were unaware of his

transporting of timber when this detection was made, and they would not have

given the vehicle to the driver if they became aware that he is a person who does

illegal things. She had stated that after the incident, the vehicle was taken over

by them and was not given to the accused thereafter.

Under cross-examination, she has stated that it is her husband who use the

vehicle now, but not on a regular basis. Explaining the reason for the vehicle to

be given to the accused, she had stated that her husband was down with a

nervous disorder and that was the reason why they gave the lorry to the accused.

Page 6 of 10

The prosecution has questioned the witness on her evidence where she had

stated that the vehicle was taken into custody by Kochchikade Police on the

premise that the vehicle has previously been taken into custody by the said police

station as well, because this was a detection by Katana Police. Her answers

provided clearly establish that she has mistakenly stated the name of the police

station and she was not telling a lie, purposely in that regard.

It is clear from the Magistrates Court proceedings that only the registered owner

had given evidence at the inquiry. The learned Additional Magistrate of Negombo

in his order dated 23-09-2021 has considered the evidence given by the appellant

and found fault with her for not calling her brothers and the husband to show

that she was vigilant over the vehicle through them, and has determined that

the appellant has failed to give any evidence before the Court to establish that

she has taken proper steps to prevent the offence being committed. The learned

Additional Magistrate has determined that the appellant failed to establish that

she took preventive measures to make sure that the offence would not be

committed, on the balance of probability. It has been decided to forfeit the vehicle

belonging to the appellant on that basis.

When the revision application filed challenging the order of the learned

Additional Magistrate was heard before the learned High Court Judge of

Negombo, the learned High Court Judge, considering the relevant provisions of

the Forest Act has determined that the learned Magistrate has considered the

evidence made available to the Court on the balance of probabilities and has

come to a correct finding. In his order, the learned High Court Judge has

determined as follows;

The requirement in section 40 A of the Forest Ordinance is to confiscate the

vehicle which has been used in committing an offence under it. Only in later

judgements, it was decided that the registered or the absolute owner of the

vehicle shall be given an opportunity to prove that they had in fact taken

precautionary steps and the offence concerned had been committed without

Page 7 of 10

their knowledge. As the statutory requirement is to confiscate the vehicle,

the presumption is that the offence has been committed with the knowledge

of the registered or absolute owner and that they have failed to take

precautionary steps therefore, it is unto the registered or absolute owner to

prove the contrary. In proving the contrary, the burden cast upon them is not

beyond reasonable doubt but balance of probabilities.

Holding that the appellant has failed to establish on balance of probabilities, that

she has taken due precautions and the learned Magistrate has come to a correct

conclusion in that regard, the revision application of the appellant has been

dismissed by the learned High Court Judge.

When this appeal was taken up for argument before the Court, the learned

Counsel for the appellant as well as the learned State Counsel who represented

the respondents agreed for a judgement based on the written submissions by the

parties. As the learned Counsel for the appellant has already filed written

submissions before the Court by that time, the learned State Counsel was

permitted further two weeks time for his written submissions, but no

submissions were filed at the time of the writing of this judgement.

I must emphasize that the learned High Court Judge was somewhat misdirected

as to the relevant provisions of the Forest Act when it was determined that the

statutory requirement is to confiscate the vehicle, which may be true as section

40 of the Forest Ordinance stood before it was amended, where the forfeiture

was automatic upon conviction.

It was after the judicial decision in Manawadu Vs. The Attorney General

(1987) 2 SLR 30 that the owner of a vehicle which would be subjected to a

forfeiture was allowed to show cause as to why the vehicle should not be

confiscated to the state.

By bringing in Forest (Amendment) Act No. 65 of 2009, the Forest Ordinance was

amended and the amended and the proviso of amended section 40 (1) reads as

follows.

Page 8 of 10

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence, is

a third party, no Order of Confiscation shall be made if such owner

proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements,

cattle and machines, as the case may be, for the commission of the

offence.

Therefore, the present statutory requirement is when the owner of the vehicle is

a third party, an order of confiscation shall not be made if such owner proves to

the satisfaction of the Court that he or she has taken all precautions to prevent

the use of such vehicle for the commission of the offence.

As considered correctly by the learned Magistrate as well as the learned High

Court Judge, the mode of proof shall be in the balance of probabilities.

However, I am not in a position to agree with the determination of the learned

Additional Magistrate of Negombo that although the registered owner gave

evidence and justified her actions, she failed to call her brothers and even her

husband to substantiate her evidence.

I must emphasize that a person, not calling any other witnesses to substantiate

his or her evidence in itself should not provide a basis to reject the said evidence,

as there is no requirement of calling a particular number of witnesses to prove a

fact.

The relevant section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance reads thus;

134. No particular number of witnesses shall in case may be required

for the proof of any act.

It is the view of this Court that if the evidence given by a witness is believable

and has not been challenged on material points, a Court can act on such

evidence even though no other evidence has been called to substantiate any fact.

Page 9 of 10

In the case under appeal, the evidence of the registered owner that she had no

knowledge of the offence being committed and she took precautions to prevent

illegal activities being carried out by the driver of the vehicle has not been

challenged on material points. She has maintained a consistent position that

due to her husbands ill health; the vehicle was given to the accused to transport

cement blocks and other similar materials, and her husband and her brothers

were vigilant over the vehicle, which means that the registered owner has been

careful of the actions of the driver to prevent illegal acts being committed using

her vehicle.

The evidence adduced before the Magistrates Court clearly establishes the fact

that the registered owner was unaware of the offence being committed.

I am of the view that the meaning of the words used by the legislature in its

wisdom in the proviso of section 40 (1) where it has been stated that had taken

all precautions to prevent the use needs to be interpreted in a pragmatic

manner rather than giving it a strict interpretation. It is my view that the facts

and the relevant circumstances in a given situation should be considered in its

totality in order to find out whether there is justification in releasing a vehicle to

its owner. If a Court is to look for all the possible precautions that an owner of a

vehicle can take in a given scenario, there can always be some other precautions

that could have been taken which in my view was not the purpose of enacting

the relevant provisions as to the confiscation of a vehicle.

In the case of Sadi Banda Vs. Officer In Charge of Nortonbridge Police Station

(2014) 1 SLR 33 it was observed by Malani Gunaratne, J.;

I am of the view before making the order of confiscation the learned

Magistrate should have taken into consideration, value of the timber

transported, no allegations prior to this incident that the lorry had been used

for any illegal purpose, that the appellant and all the accused are habitual

offenders in this nature and no previous convictions, and the acceptance of

the fact that the appellant did not have any knowledge about the

Page 10 of 10

transporting of timber without a permit. On these facts, the Court is of the

view that the confiscation of the lorry is not justifiable.

Having considered the facts and the relevant circumstances in relation to the

matter under appeal, I am of the view that this is a fit and proper case where the

learned Magistrate should have considered the totality of the uncontradicted

evidence of the registered owner in order to find out whether releasing of the

vehicle can be justified, and I find that the vehicle should have been released to

the registered owner on that basis.

I am not in a position to agree with the determination of the learned High Court

Judge as well for the same reasons.

Accordingly, I set aside the order dated 23-09-2021 of the learned Additional

Magistrate of Negombo and the order dated 09-09-2022 of the learned High

Court Judge of Negombo.

I order the release of the vehicle numbered 48-0440 to the appellant, who is the

registered owner of the vehicle.
