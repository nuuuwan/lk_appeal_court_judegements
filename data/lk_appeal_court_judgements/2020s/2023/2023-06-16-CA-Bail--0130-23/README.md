ORDER

P.Kumararatnam,J.

The Petitioner filing this Application has invoked the jurisdiction of this

Court to grant bail to the Suspect upon suitable condition as this Court

consider appropriate.

The Suspect is the 14th Accused in the case bearing No. HC TAB

Colombo 2972/21 in the High Court Trial at Bar of Colombo.

The Suspect was arrested in connection with the Buddha Statue

vandalization case and produced before MC,Mawanella under case No.

B 11330/2018 on 23.01.2019.Therafter he was detained under a

detention order said to have been issued under Section 9(1) of the

Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act No.48 of 1979.It was

alleged that the Suspect had aided, abetted or conspired in any terrorist

activity or concealed any information from security forces or in

spreading Muslim Extremism which, according to the Petitioner, in

any event is not an offence known to the law.

The Petitioner states that the Suspect had become aware that the

Easter Sunday attack had taken place on 21/04/2019 at a time when

he was in state custody from the time of his arrest on 22/01/2019 and

that the Suspect had nothing to whatsoever to do with the said Easter

Sunday attack and seeks bail from this Court under Section 15 B of the

of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Act

No.22 of 2022.

According to the Petitioner, the Suspect is 60 years old and has been

treated for recurrent respiratory tract infections with a history of cough,

difficulty in breathing and fever and had been admitted to the Prison

Hospital and the National Hospital Kandy for the recurrent afflictions.

Although a bail application was filed in the High Court at Bar-Colombo

on behalf of the Suspect, the Court had declined the request for bail

having considered the objections of the State. Further, the Court did

not give reasons for not granting the request for bail. Now the Petitioner

seeks relief in the exercise of the Original Jurisdiction vested by Section

15 B of the Prevention of Terrorism (Special Provisions) (Amendment)

Act No. 22 of 2022.

At the hearing the State Counsel representing the Respondents raised

following preliminary objections:

a. That the Petitioner is preclude from making this application

before this Court since the Suspect named in the Petition is the

14th Accused (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) of the

Indictment before the High Court at Bar Holden in Colombo

bearing No. HC TAB 2972/2021 and contend as per Section 15

of the Prevention of Terrorism Act No.48 of 1979 as

amended(hereinafter referred to as the PTA read with the

provisions of Sections 450 and 451 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No.15 of 1979(hereinafter referred to as the

CCPA ).

b. That the Petitioner is preclude from making this application

since the Petitioner is barred from invoking the jurisdiction of

this Court as Section 15 B of the PTA as amended has no

application in this matter since the indictment has been already

served on the Accused in the High Court at bar case No. HC

TAB 2972/2021.

c. In any event, that the Accused has already exhausted his rights

of invoking the original jurisdiction of the High Court at-Bar

under Section 15 B of the PTA as amended and hence, the

Petitioner is precluded from invoking the original jurisdiction of

this Court.

CA BAL 130-2023

In reply to the preliminary objection (a) the Petitioner contend that the

Court of Appeal is vested with jurisdiction to hear and determine this

matter under Article 138(2) of the Constitution read with Section 15 B

of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act as amended

by Act No 12 of 2022.

In reply to preliminary objection (b) the Petitioner contend that it is

Section 15 B of PTA which has no application and that it is the newly

enacted Section 15 B that is applicable. A reading of Article 138(2) of

the Constitution and Section 15 B would make it clear that the Court of

Appeal has Original Jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal does not lose its

jurisdiction merely based on the Indictment being served on the

accused in the High Court as claimed by the Respondents.

In reply to preliminary objection (c) the Petitioner contend that the

Constitutional jurisdiction vested and ordained in the Court of Appeal

under Article 138(2) of the Constitution cannot in law be exhausted or

ousted by Section 15 B of the PTA, which latter provision in fact and in

law consolidates and strengthens the powers of the Court of Appeal,

which, Parliament by enacting 15 B of PTA has by law vested and

ordained as specific in Article 138(2) of the Constitution.

The Section 15 B of PTA (Amended) Act No. 12 of 2022 states:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the provisions of this Act, if

the trial against a person remanded or detained under this Act has not

commenced after the expiration of twelve months, from the date of

arrest, the Court of Appeal may release such person on bail, upon an

application in that behalf, made by the suspect or an Attorney- at Law

on his behalf:

Provided however, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) of

section 15, the High Court may in exceptional circumstances release

the suspect on bail subject to such conditions as the High Court may

deem fit:

CA BAL 130-2023

6 | P a g e

Provided further, where the trial against an accused in respect of whom

the indictment has been forwarded and filed in the High Court, has not

commenced after the expiration of twelve months from the date of such

filing, the High Court may consider to release such person on bail, upon

an application in that behalf made by the accused or an Attorney- at-

Law on his behalf.

As stated by Salmond, by interpretation or construction is meant, the

process by which the courts seek to ascertain the meaning of the

legislature through the medium of authoritative forms in which it is

expressed.

Interpretation of statutes is the process of ascertain the true meaning of

the words used in a statute. When language is of the statue is clear,

there is no need the rules of Interpretation, But, in certain cases, more

than one meaning may be derived from the same word or sentence. It is

therefore necessary to interpret the statue to find out the real intention

of the statute.

In this regard, a Constitution Bench of five Judges of the Supreme

Court in R.S.Nayak v.A.R.Antulay,AIR 1984 SC 684 has held:

. If the words of the Statute are clear and unambiguous, it is

the plainest duty of the Court to give effect to the natural meaning

of the words used in the provision. The question of construction

arises only in the event of an ambiguity or the plain meaning of the

words used in the Statute would be self-defeating. (para 18)

The purpose of Interpretation of Statutes is to help the Judge to

ascertain the intention of the Legislature-not to control that intention or

to confine it within the limits, which the Judge may deem reasonable or

expedient.

It is pertinent to quote the remarks made by the Hon.Minister when the

Bill of PTA (Amended) Act No.12 of 2022 was presented to the

Parliament. The Minister remarked as follows:

Having regard to all the changes which have taken place in our

country during the last 43 years, we have whittled down the provisions

of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, diminished its rigidity in a manner

that is appropriate to the present stage of development of Sri Lankan

society. We have stopped short of abolishing it altogether. That is too

extreme a step and lacks a sense of balance.(Colum-788 of the

Hansard).

..when you take the Amendments a whole, in combination, I make

bold to say that the cumulative effect of these Amendments is to make a

very substantial improvement of the existing law.I can convince any

objective fair-minded person that these Amendments, without any

extraneous agenda, will make a profound impact upon the existing laws

of this country and that these Amendments will significant further the

cause of human rights and human freedom in Sri Lanka. (Colum-780

of the Hansard).

.the existing position in our country is that there can be and there

had been, in some cases, unfortunately, and interval as long as six

months or nine months between one date of trial and another, this

means that the person who is subject to the Determination Order is

languishing in custody for unjustifiably long period because the trial is

taking so long (Colum-781 of the Hansard).

Hence, when interpreting the provisions in the PTA amended Act No.12

of 2022, not only it should reflect the intention of the Legislature, but

also reflect the true meaning of the words used in the Statute.

The main objection taken by the Respondent is that in view of Section

15 B of PTA has no application in this matter since the indictment has

been already served on the accused in the High Court at Bar.

CA BAL 130-2023

The Section 15 B of PTA (Amendment) Act No. 12 of 2022 states:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the provisions of this Act, if

the trial against a person remanded or detained under this Act has not

commenced after the expiration of twelve months, from the date of

arrest, the Court of Appeal may release such person on bail, upon an

application in that behalf, made by the suspect or an Attorney- at Law

on his behalf:

In 15 B of PTA (Amendment) Act No. 12 of 2022, the key word is the

trial. If the trial has not commenced after 12 months from the date of

arrest, the Court of Appeal may release such person on bail,

irrespective of whether the suspect has been indicted or not. Unless the

trial is commenced, sending out indictment to relevant High Court does

not preclude the suspect seeking bail from the Court of Appeal. The bail

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Section 15 B of PTA

(Amendment) Act No.12 of 2022 only shifts to High Court once the trial

is commenced in the High Court.

The plain meaning of the trial is the formal examination before a

competent tribunal of the matter in issue in a civil or criminal cause in

order to determine such issue. Hence, serving the indictment on the

accused does not preclude the Petitioner invoking the jurisdiction of

this Court for bail under Section 15 B of PTA(Amendment) Act No.12 of

2012. This entitlement only shifts once the formal trial commence

before the High Court upon filing an indictment. As long as the trial is

not commenced after filing the indictment before the High Court, the

suspect is legally entitled to seek bail before the Court of Appeal.

Even though the accused has already exhausted his rights of invoking

the original jurisdiction of the High Court at-Bar under Section 15 B of

the PTA as amended, his entitlement to come before the Court of Appeal

CA BAL 130-2023

9 | P a g e

under Section 15 B of the PTA as amended will not curtailed as long as

the trial is not commenced before the High Court at-Bar.

Due to aforesaid reasons the preliminary objections raised by the

Respondents are hereby dismissed and the matter is fixed for inquiry.
