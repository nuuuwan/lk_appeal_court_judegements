Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Gampaha for having caused the death of Dharmakeerthi

Abeywickrama alias Chaminda on 23-07-2003 at Kadawatha, and thereby

committing the offence of murder, punishable in terms of section 296 of the Penal

Code.

After trial without a jury, the appellant was found guilty as charged by the

learned High Court Judge of Gampaha of the Judgement dated 07-10-2021, and

accordingly, he has been sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant preferred

this appeal.

At the very outset, it needs to be stated that this is a matter where the conviction

has been entirely dependent on the dying declarations, the deceased supposed

to have made to several witnesses, and other incidental evidence.

Page 3 of 17

The Facts in Brief

The 1st witness called by the defence had been the PW-03 listed in the

indictment. He was the elder brother of the deceased. According to his evidence,

the deceased had been working in a bakery belonging to one Saman Mudalali.

He has come to know that his brother suffered burn injuries as a result of an

incident happened at the bakery. His brother has been receiving treatment for

about two and a half months in the Colombo General Hospital and PW-03 was

the person who looked after him throughout his stay in the hospital.

While hospitalized, the deceased has informed the witness that he had disputes

with a person called Ranjith. He has told him that while he was sleeping in the

bakery, he was awakened when something was poured on him where he saw

Ranjith with a matchstick, and he set fire to him. He has informed further that

the incident occurred while he was sleeping in front of the bakery furnace on a

wooden box.

The mentioned Ranjith was a person unknown to the witness. The deceased has

passed away on 08-10-2003 while receiving treatment and the witness has

identified his body at the post-mortem.

PW-01 Samoan Prasad was the owner of the bakery, where this incident

occurred. He has confirmed that the deceased as well as the appellant were

working under him at the time relevant to this incident and both of them were

working as labourers at the bakery. While at home on 22-07-2003, around 1.30

2.00 a.m., he has been informed by another servant that the deceased servant

had been set on fire by the appellant and had run away. After hearing the news

he has gone to the bakery, the has been informed that the deceased was taken

to the Ragama hospital. When he reached the hospital, he has seen the deceased

screaming due to pain, but was in a position to talk. When asked what happened,

the deceased has informed him that while he was seated on a wooden bench

(), Ranjith poured petrol on the back of his body () and set him on fire.

The witness has identified the mentioned Ranjith as the appellant.

Page 4 of 17

Explaining further, the witness has stated that when these words were uttered,

the deceased was not admitted to the hospital ward, but was on a stretcher

outside of it. The witness has been very specific that when he met him before he

was admitted to the hospital ward that night, he spoke to him and informed him

that it was the appellant who set him on fire, but has stated further, that after

admission to the hospital, he could not speak for about a week. However, after

he was transferred to Colombo hospital, he regained his ability to talk after 4 or

5 days of treatment at the Colombo hospital.

Speaking about the reason for this incident, the witness has stated that when

he went to the bakery in that evening, both the appellant as well as the deceased

came and informed him about a quarrel that happened between them, and he

has opined that it may be the reason for this incident.

PW-05 Wasantha Kumara had been called by the prosecution as another person

to whom the deceased has narrated what happened to him. He has been a

witness to the earlier incident where the deceased and the appellant had a

quarrel. According to his evidence, both of them had exchanged blows as a result

of the quarrel, and around 1.15 a.m. in the night while he was sleeping, he has

felt a heat and had seen the deceased on fire. He has observed that the appellant

was nowhere to be seen in the bakery. The evidence of PW-05 had been that the

deceased was screaming in pain and did not inform what happened to him other

than screaming pleading to rescue him. The witness has stated that he spoke

about what happened at the hospital, but not to him. He has stated that because

of the earlier incident and since the appellant was nowhere to be seen after the

incident, he suspects the appellant for causing the injuries.

The other person who heard the dying declaration of the deceased was PW-07

PC 16512 Upul Kumara Ubhayaratna. He had been a Police Constable attached

to Kadawatha police station and was the person who has recorded the statement

of the deceased Dharmakeerthi Abeywickrama on 29-07-2003 at 12.30 p.m.

Page 5 of 17

while he was receiving treatment at ward number 20 in the Colombo National

Hospital.

When giving the statement, the deceased has been covered with bandages from

the hip upwards up to his neck. He has been in a position to speak. The witness

has narrated the entire statement made to him by the deceased, which has been

marked as X during the trial.

In the statement, the deceased has stated that;

The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who conducted the post-mortem of the

deceased has observed over 60% of his body with burn injuries. He has expressed

the view that the probability of dying because of the injuries would be very much

higher even if the injured person was treated in a hospital due to the level of

injuries sustained by him. The JMO has expressed the opinion that the death

was due to septicemia condition due to the burn injuries sustained by the

deceased.

At the conclusion of the prosecution evidence and when called for a defence, the

appellant has made a dock statement. In his dock statement, he has admitted

that there was a quarrel between him and the deceased in the evening of the day

of the incident. It had been his position that after hearing about this incident,

Page 6 of 17

the owner of the bakery came to the bakery in the afternoon, scolded both of

them and said that they should leave if they cannot work in the bakery.

The position of the appellant had been that he left the bakery as a result and

after staying for few days at his previous wifes house, found employment in

another bakery and after about 7 days, the owner of the bakery and some others

came and took him to the police station. He has denied that he has anything to

do with the burn injuries suffered by the deceased and had claimed innocence

in that regard.

It is clear from the Judgement pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of

Gampaha that the learned High Court Judge has been very much considerate of

the basic principles of evidence that need to be adhered to when evidence of a

case of this nature is evaluated. The learned High Court Judge has determined

that this is a matter where a dying declaration should be considered and has

drawn his attention to the matters that needs to be considered in such a

situation.

The learned High Court Judge has evaluated the evidence in that context and

had found that the evidence as to the dying declarations that the deceased had

allegedly made to several witnesses and to the police officer who recorded his

statement are cogent and reliable. The learned High Court Judge has considered

the defence taken up by the appellant and had determined that it did not create

any doubt as to the evidence of the prosecution witness. The evidence of the JMO

has been well considered since the cause of death has been determined as a

condition called septicemia, and has determined that the occurring of such a

condition was due to the deliberate actions of the appellant where his actions

fall within the ambit of section 294 3rd limb. The appellant has been convicted

on that basis.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. The learned trial Judge has erred in law by not affording the option of

a jury to the accused prior to the commencement of the trial.

2. The learned trial Judge has failed to consider the discrepancies with

regard to the dying declaration of the deceased.

3. The learned trial Judge has failed to consider the discrepancies with

regard to the procedure that needs to be adhered to when handling the

productions against the accused-appellant.

I will now proceed to consider each ground of appeal separately having regard to

the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the appellant as well as the

learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) who represented the respondent.

Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal

The 1st Ground of Appeal :-

The argument of the learned Counsel for the appellant was that the learned High

Court Judge has failed to correctly follow the requirements of section 195ee of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

Citing several decided cases, it was his position that, said procedural defect has

the effect of vitiating the conviction of the appellant.

He relied on the case of The Attorney General Vs. Segulebbe Latheef And

Another (2008) 1 SLR 225 and Wijesena Silva Vs. Attorney General (1998) 3

SLR 309.

Both the above Judgements were Judgements where it was determined that

following section 195ee of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act (CPA) is

mandatory, because it gives the option for an accused person to be tried by a

Page 8 of 17

jury or tried by a Judge. It has been determined that failure to follow the said

provision would vitiate a Judgement on that basis alone.

Therefore, it is the view of this Court that the relevant law in that regard is well

settled as considered above.

The relevant section 195ee which came into effect as a result of the Code of

Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act No. 11 of 1988 reads as follows.

195ee. If the indictment relates to an offence triable by a jury, inquire

from the accused whether or not he elects to be tried by a jury.

Section 195 of the CPA is the provision where certain procedural steps that have

to be taken once the indictment is received by the relevant High Court has been

described. It is clear from the said provisions that these steps are steps that had

to be taken before the matter is fixed for the trial, and not after the case has been

fixed for trial.

When it comes to the facts relevant to the case under appeal, the High Court

case record clearly establishes the fact that when the indictment was served on

the appellant on 06-12-2007, other than fixing the matter for trial and releasing

the appellant on bail, no other procedural step as required by section 195 of the

CPA has been followed.

The trial of this matter has commenced on 10-12-2013, where the indictment

has been read over to the appellant and he has pleaded not guilty. On that day,

PW-03 who was the elder brother of the deceased has given evidence and

concluded.

When the case was taken up again on 11-11-2014 before the same Judge who

heard the evidence of PW-03, the learned High Court Judge, apparently realizing

the failure to follow due procedure, has decided to read over the charge again to

the appellant and has asked the appellant whether he wants the case to be heard

by a jury or without a jury. The appellant has informed the Court that he wants

the matter to be heard without a jury.

Page 9 of 17

After recording that fact, the learned trial Judge who heard the matter then, has

decided to proceed with the trial by calling the other witnesses relevant to the

matter. It needs to be noted that on 22-04-2015, the prosecution has moved to

amend the indictment indicating an alias of the deceased Dharmakeerthi

Abeywickrama as Dharmakeerthi Abeywickrama alias Chaminda.

After allowing the said amendment, the learned High Court Judge has again

taken steps to read over the amended charge to the appellant and had inquired

whether he elects to be tried by a jury or not. The appellant has informed the

Court that he is prepared to be tried without a jury and has agreed to proceed

with the case without the previously led evidence being recalled.

The above facts clearly suggest that this is not a matter where the jury option as

required in terms of section 195ee had not been given to the appellant, but a

situation where the said option has been given after the conclusion of the 1st

witness for the prosecution.

I am of the view that this is a case where it cannot be said that the jury option

had not been given to the appellant, which is a situation different to the matters

considered in the above-mentioned cases where the jury option has not been

given at all.

Under the circumstances, I would like to get inspiration from the ratio decidendi

of the case of Hiniduma Dahanayake Siripala alias Kiri Mahaththaya And

Another Vs. Attorney General SC Appeal No. 115/2014 decided on 22-01-

2020.

This is a case where it was contended that the trial Court failed to follow the

provisions of section 196 of the CPA where it is necessary for the Court to read

and explain the indictment to the accused person when the Court is ready to

commence the trial, and ask whether he is guilty or not guilty of the offence

charged. There was nothing in the High Court case record to indicate that the

charge was read over to the accused and whether he pleaded not guilty to the

charge. However, it was clear from the High Court proceedings that the trial has

Page 10 of 17

proceeded on the basis that the accused pleaded not guilty to the charge and the

Judgement has been pronounced accordingly.

Per Aluvihare, P.C., J.;

The learned Counsel for the 1st and 2nd accused-appellants

strenuously argued the importance of trial Judges adhering to the

procedure laid down under the law. I fully agree with this view. But

as Alexander Pope once said, to err is human. Judges erring in their

human capacities is but an inevitable fact of the justice system. What

we must be conscious of, is the need to rectify such mistakes and

lapses in every such instance where they have casued prejudice to

the rights of the parties or have subverted the course of justice. At the

same time, we must caution against attaching too great a meaning to

a mistake, lest we provide a person with a free ticket out of a

conviction which the evidence fully warrants. In this present appeal,

no justification was made in regard to any prejudice to the substantial

rights of the accused-appellants or that the irregularity has

occasioned a failure of justice, which are constitutional requirements

if the accused-appellants are to be granted relief in this case.

When it comes to the matters relevant in relation to the appeal under

consideration, as I have stated above, this is not a case where jury option has

not been given, but given subsequently to the commencement of the trial. After

concluding the evidence of PW-03 and before the commencement of the evidence

of the other witnesses, the learned High Court Judge has taken steps to correct

the procedural defect of not giving the jury option to the appellant.

It is clear from the proceedings that when it was given, the appellant had elected

not to be tried by a jury. The appellant had been legally represented by a Counsel

throughout the case. Had he elected to be tried by a jury when that opportunity

was afforded to him, the trial Judge would have had to stop the trial being

proceeded and take necessary steps to appoint a jury and proceed therefrom.

Page 11 of 17

Under the circumstances, if it was so, there cannot be any argument that the

previously led evidence of PW-03 will have to be taken again as the said evidence

was not taken before the jury. The proceedings before the Court amply

demonstrates that since the appellant has elected not to be tried by a jury, the

case has proceeded to further trial.

Even after the indictment was amended to include an alias of the deceased in

the charge, it appears from the case record that the learned High Court Judge

has taken the correct procedural step of reading the amended charge to the

appellant and had taken an additional burden by inquiring again whether he

elects to be tried by a jury.

The above-mentioned facts clearly show that the intention of the appellant had

been to be tried without a jury. He has clearly demonstrated his wish when the

learned trial Judge inquired him on two separate occasions whether he elects to

be tried by a jury or not.

Under the circumstances, I am of the view that since this is not a matter where

jury option has not been given to the appellant at all, there had been no prejudice

caused to the substantial rights of the appellant or occasioned a failure of justice.

The proviso to Article 138 of The Constitution which is the article which gives

the jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal to exercise appellate jurisdiction reads

thus;

Provided that no Judgement, decree or order of any Court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

For the reasons as set out above, I find no basis for the 1st ground of appeal

urged by the learned Counsel for the appellant.

Page 12 of 17

The 2nd Ground of Appeal:-

The 2nd ground of appeal urged by the learned Counsel for the appellant is based

on the premise that there are several discrepancies with regard to the alleged

dying declaration of the deceased.

Before considering the contention of the learned Counsel about the alleged

discrepancies, I would now proceed to consider the manner in which a dying

declaration or declarations of a person can be considered as evidence in a

criminal trial.

In terms of section 32 of the Evidence Ordinance, statements by persons who

cannot be called as witnesses are relevant under certain circumstances. The

relevant section 32 (1) reads as follows.

32. (1) When the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his

death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which

resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that persons

death comes into question.

Such statements are relevant whether the person who made them was or was

not at the time when they were made, under the expectation of death and

whatever may be the nature of the proceedings in which the cause of his death

comes into question.

E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy in his authoritative book on The Law of Evidence

Volume 1 at page 431 refers to several cases decided by the Indian Supreme

Court as to the rules that should be laid down in that regard.

The rules laid down by the Indian Supreme Court may be summarized as

follows:

1. Ordinarily it is not safe to base a conviction for murder only upon

the dying declaration of the deceased when there is no

Page 13 of 17

corroboration of it from any independent source. Such

corroboration may be by circumstantial evidence , or an oral

statement made to a relative shortly after the incident may

corroborate a subsequent duly recorded dying declaration .

2. Though ordinarily corroboration must be looked for, there is no

absolute rule of law or prudence that corroboration is always

necessary before a conviction which rests on a dying declaration

can be sustained. Corroboration is necessary when the declaration

is an incomplete statement which is not categoric in the accusation

as to a crime against a named person or when the declaration

suffers from some infirmity.

3. Where the Court is satisfied that the dying declaration is true and

reliable and does not suffer from any infirmity, a conviction can be

based upon it even in the absence of corroboration. Each case must

be Judged on its own facts. If it is proved that the dying declaration

were made without any prompting or influenced by anyone and

there is no cogent reason given or suggested by the accused for

throwing doubt in their truth or correctness, the conviction can be

based solely on them.

In the case of Ranasinghe Vs. The Attorney General (2007) 1 SLR 2018, it

was held;

1. When a dying declaration is considered as an item of evidence against

an accused person in a criminal trial, the trial Judge/jury must bear in

mind the following weaknesses.

a. The statement of the deceased person was not made under oath;

b. The statement of the deceased person has not been tested by

cross-examination;

2. The trial Judge/jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the

following matters.

a. Whether the deceased in fact made such a statement;

Page 14 of 17

b. Whether the statement made by the deceased was true and

accurate;

c. Whether the statement made by the deceased could be accepted

beyond reasonable doubt.

d. Whether the evidence of the witness who testifies about the dying

declaration could be accepted beyond reasonable doubt.

e. Whether the witness is telling the truth;

f. Whether the deceased was able to speak at the time the alleged

declaration was made.

It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the evidence

of PW-01 who was the owner of the bakery, that he was told by the deceased that

it was the appellant who poured petrol on him and set him on fire, cannot be

believed due to his own evidence and that of PW-03.

This is a case where the evidence of the prosecution had been to the effect that

the deceased made several dying declarations to several persons other than the

police officer who recorded the statement of the deceased.

PW-03 is the brother of the deceased who looked after him during his two and a

half months long stay at the hospital before he passed away. It had been his

evidence that while receiving treatment, he divulged to him that it was the

appellant who set fire on him.

The evidence of PW-01 who was the employer of the deceased as well as the

appellant, had been that when he was taken to the hospital, although he had

serious burn injuries and was screaming in pain, the appellant was able to talk

to him before he was admitted to the hospital ward. It had been his evidence that

the deceased informed him that it was the appellant who set him on fire after

pouring petrol on him.

The learned Counsel for the appellant has relied on the evidence of PW-01, the

owner of the bakery, where he states that after admitting him to the hospital, the

deceased could not talk and it was only after 4-5 days of his admission to the

Page 15 of 17

Colombo General Hospital, the deceased was able to talk, suggesting that the

evidence of PW-01, which says that the deceased talked to him before he was

admitted to the hospital cannot be believed.

However, I am in no position to agree with that contention. When reading the

evidence of PW-01 as well as that of PW-03, it becomes amply clear that what

the PW-01 had stated before the trial Court was the truth as to what happened

on that day. It may well be that the deceased had spoken to his employer just

before he was admitted to the hospital for medical care. He may not have spoken

thereafter for some time until he was in a position to speak after receiving

treatment for his injuries. That does not mean that the evidence of PW-01 was

not cogent enough to accept as the truth. I am not in a position to believe that

the evidence in that regard as contradictory.

Although the learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the evidence of

the witnesses was contradictory, I find no basis to consider as such. It is clear

from the evidence that the witnesses have spoken about what they saw and what

they heard from the deceased. The fact that there had been a previous quarrel

in the evening of the day of the incident had been an admitted fact which has

provided a corroboration as to the sequence of events that had happened on that

day. The evidence of PW-01 clearly indicates that the appellant was present when

he left his establishment after advising both the deceased and the appellant over

the dispute they had. It has been clearly established that after the incident, the

appellant was nowhere to be seen until he was arrested by the police some days

after the incident.

I find no basis to accept the appellants explanation that he left his job after his

employer told him to leave if he cannot work. The evidence of other witnesses

clearly establishes it was not the case, but the appellant was present until they

found that the deceased was set on fire. Even the evidence of PW-05 who was

another employer of the bakery who saw the deceased on fire speaks about the

appellant not being present when he looked for him at the time of the incident.

Page 16 of 17

It is clear from the Judgement of the learned High Court Judge that the evidence

has been considered with the relevant legal requirements in mind and the

relevant conclusions have been reached after duly analyzing the evidence, for

which I find no reason to disagree.

The evidence of PW-07, the police officer who recorded the statement of the

deceased clearly establishes the fact that he was able to speak and narrate what

happened to him. The deceased has made a dying declaration to him, which

clearly demonstrates that the statement has been made without any prompting

or influence.

For the reasons considered above, I am of the view that the relying on the dying

declarations that have been made by the deceased to determine the charge

against the appellant had been done after considering the evidence in accordance

with the law.

Hence, I find no merit in the considered ground of appeal.

The 3rd Ground of Appeal :-

In the 3rd ground of appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant contends about

the productions taken over by the police during their investigations.

I am of the view that the productions were not an essential requirement in

proving the charge against the appellant and the prosecution has not relied on

productions to prove the charge.

The learned High Court Judge has correctly considered the issues that had

arisen during the trial in relation to the productions in its correct perspective. It

is the view of this Court, that even if there were no productions at all, given the

facts and circumstances and the evidence led in the trial provides a sufficient

basis to conclude that the charge has been proved beyond reasonable doubt

against the appellant.

Page 17 of 17

For the reasons considered above, I find no basis for the grounds of appeal urged

on behalf of the appellant.

Accordingly, the appeal preferred by the appellant is dismissed. The conviction

and the sentence dated 07-10-2021 affirmed.
