MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. We heard the learned Counsel for the Respondent-Appellant-Petitioners in support of this Application. Having scrutinized the petition, affidavit, documents, the impugned Order of the Wakf Tribunal dated 10-12-2022 and the oral submission of the learned Counsel for the Respondent-Appellant-Petitioners, it is the view of this Court that this is a fit and proper case to grant leave to appeal, and therefore the leave to appeal as prayed for in prayer (a) of the petition dated 20-12-2020 is granted. Upon tendering, issue notice on the Respondents.
