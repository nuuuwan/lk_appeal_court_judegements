The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following grounds of appeal for consideration of the Court.

(1) The prosecution failed to prove the chain of the custody of

productions beyond reasonable doubt.

(2) The learned High Court Judge failed to consider the inherent

improbabilities of the story of the prosecution.

(3) The learned High Court Judge exceeded the power conferred upon

him by section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance, and thereby denied a

fair trial towards the appellant.

(4) The learned High Court Judge failed to consider inter se and per se

contradictions in the prosecution evidence.

(5) The learned High Court Judge failed to analyze the evidence of the

prosecution and that of the defence in the correct perspective.

Facts in Brief

The facts that led to the arrest of the appellant as revealed in evidence can be

summarized in the following manner.

PW-01 was a sub-inspector attached to the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) on

the day relevant to this incident, namely 24th September 2008. He, along with 6

other officers attached to PNB has left their station at 7.50 in the morning to

conduct a raid in Peliyagoda area, which was unsuccessful.

Around 12.45 hours, PC-13158 Niroshan who was a member of his team that

went on the raid has informed PW-01 that he received an information of a

Heroin trafficking in Borella. PW-01 has not revealed to the trial Court the

exact information received by PC Niroshan but it was his evidence that he and

his team left towards Borella after receiving the information. They have stopped

Page 4 of 14

their vehicle near Lankaramaya Temple in Borella and walked up to the railway

crossing where he has met up with the informant of PC Niroshan. PW-01 and

PC Niroshan has been informed by the informant that a person called Sudu

would be coming this way with Heroin.

According to PW-01, he has met the informant at 13.20 hours. PW-01 along

with PC Niroshan and the informant had waited at the place where they met for

few minutes and at 13.25 hours, the informant has pointed his hand towards a

person who was coming towards them about 50 meters ahead and had

informed that he is the person called Sudu. After showing the person, the

informant had left them. Accordingly, PW-01 and PC Niroshan has stopped the

person shown by the informant and searched him, where they have found a

parcel inside the right-hand front side pocket in the denim trouser he was

wearing. Upon inspection, they have found the substance inside to be Heroin

and the suspect who is the appellant has been arrested.

He has identified him as Jinendra Prabhath Liyanage alias Suda. After the

arrest, he has been taken to his house. It was the evidence of PW-01 that his

house was not searched, but he was taken to the house for the purpose of

informing the arrest to his household members.

When weighed at the PNB, it has been found that the substance recovered from

the possession of the appellant had 70 grams and 500 milligrams. After

weighing the productions, PW-01 has taken steps to seal them following the

due procedure and had handed over the productions to the production officer

of the PNB, namely Sub-Inspector Samarakoon at 16.20 hours on 24th

September 2008.

The position taken up by the appellant during the trial had been that he was

never arrested near the railway crossing as claimed by the prosecution

witnesses, but at his house while sleeping after having consumed liquor. It has

been the position of the appellant that police party came and searched the

Page 5 of 14

house and although they failed to recover anything, he was arrested and the

substance was introduced upon him.

The prosecution has called PC-13158 Danuka Niroshan Perera (PW-02) to

corroborate the evidence of PW-01. He has confirmed that he along with PW-01

who was his superior officer and another team of officials left the PNB in the

morning for a raid, which was initially unsuccessful.

It was his evidence that he received an information at 12.40 hours by a

personal informant of him that a person called Kudu Prabath from

Wanathamulla area of Borella is carrying Heroin, and if he can come quickly,

the said person can be pointed out. As the informant was a trusted source of

information, PW-02 has apprised PW-01 about the information and accordingly

they have gone towards Borella and stopped the vehicle near the Lankaramaya

Temple. PW-01 and 02 has walked towards the railway crossing to meet the

informant and had met up with him. While they were talking to each other, the

informant had pointed out a person who was coming from the direction of the

Sarawanamuththu playground towards them about 40 meters away. The

person pointed out by the informant has been stopped and searched where

they have recovered a parcel of Heroin from the side pocket of the trouser he

was wearing.

PW-01 has taken charge of the suspected substance and had arrested the

suspect whom he has identified as the appellant before the trial Court. He has

explained the procedure followed by them to weigh the productions, seal them

and to handover to the production officer of PNB.

It had been his position that when they went to Borella and walked towards the

rail gate, the informant had been already waiting for them there, and they

talked for about 10 minutes before the informant pointed out the appellant as

the person carrying Heroin. It needs to be noted that although in his evidence

in chief, PW-02 has stated that the information received by him was to the

Page 6 of 14

effect that a person called Kudu Prabath would be coming with a parcel of

Heroin, under cross-examination, what he has stated was that the information

received by him was to the effect that a person called Wanathamulle Sudu is

bringing Heroin to be handed over to another person.

At the trial, the prosecution has led the evidence of the Government Analyst to

confirm that the substance produced for analysis had a pure quantity of 13.56

grams of Heroin. The prosecution has also led evidence of the other relevant

witnesses to substantiate the prosecution case.

When the appellant was called for a defence at the conclusion of the

prosecution case, he has chosen to give evidence under oath. It had been his

evidence that on the day of his arrest, he was sleeping at his home and a police

party came to inquire about his brother called Prasanna. It had been his

position that since the police party could not find his brother Prasanna, he was

assaulted and arrested, taken to the PNB and Heroin was introduced upon

him.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

In his first ground of appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant contended

that the prosecution has failed to prove the chain of custody of productions

beyond reasonable doubt. It was his position that although PW-01 has claimed

that he handed over the productions to Production Officer of PNB, namely Sub-

Inspector Samarakoon, on 24th September 2008 at 16.20 hours, the

prosecution has failed to prove the chain of custody up to the point where the

productions had been handed over to the Government Analyst on 30th

September 2008.

It is clear from the evidence led at the trial, by the time this matter was taken

up for trial, the relevant Production Officer who had been named, as PW-03 in

the indictment was deceased. The prosecution has called a Chief Inspector

attached to the PNB (PW-06) to produce the notes made by SI Samarakoon

Page 7 of 14

while working at the PNB in relation to this action in terms of section 32 of the

Evidence Ordinance. He has confirmed that SI Samarakoon has received the

productions on 24-09-2008, and the same officer has taken the productions to

the Government Analyst on 30-09-2008 and had handed over the same under

Government Analyst Reference Number CD 2837/08 to Assistant Government

Analyst V. S. Rajasekara. The same officer has taken the productions from the

Government Analyst after its analysis and taken them to the PNB on 13-08-

2010.

When this case was mentioned for further trial on 01-07-2016, the Counsel

who represented the appellant had agreed to admit the relevant notes made by

SI Samarakoon in terms of section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

For the reasons set out above, I find no merit in the argument that the

prosecution has failed to prove the custody of the productions. It is clear from

the evidence that after the productions were handed over to the Production

Officer of the PNB, the productions have been kept under the custody of the

same officer until he handed over the productions to the Government Analyst.

Having determined the 1st ground of appeal urged, I will now proceed to

consider the 2nd, 4th and the 5th grounds of appeal together as they are

interconnected.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant was that the way the

prosecution witnesses claim that the informant met them and pointed out the

appellant was improbable given the fact that the stand of the appellant had

been that he was not arrested near the railway crossing as claimed by the

prosecution witnesses.

It was his view that it is impossible to believe that an informant would expose

himself in a manner stated by the witnesses given the facts and the

circumstances relevant to this case. According to PW-01s evidence, he has

received the information from a known informant of PW-02. PW-02 has stated

Page 8 of 14

that his informant was a trusted and reliable person which shows that the

informant has provided previous information to the police.

According to the evidence, the informant has met PW-01 and 02 near the

railway crossing that runs across Lesley Ranagala Mawatha in Borella. It is a

well-known fact that this area is a highly densely populated area where various

illegal activities take place. The witnesses speak about the informant who

waited near the railway crossing for them and having engaged in a

conversation for about 10 minutes before he pointed out the appellant by a

hand gesture. When the appellant was shown to the witnesses, according to

PW-01s evidence, the appellant was about 50 meters away and according to

PW-02, it was about 40 meters, which shows that at the time the informant

had allegedly pointed out the appellant, they were within a distance where each

other can be identified.

This incident had happened in the broad daylight. It is my considered view that

any informant, especially in drug related matters, would be extremely careful

not to blow his cover, as if his identity is exposed, he will have to face

disastrous consequences. Under the circumstances, it is hard to believe of an

informant waiting for about 10 minutes with the police officers, talking to them

and showing the appellant in the manner described by the witnesses. It is quite

possible that if it happened in the manner narrated in evidence, there would be

a high probability for the appellant to see the informant before he left the scene

or he can very well suspect that it was the informant who provided this

information which led to his arrest as it was soon after the informant left, he

was arrested.

Although the police officers claim that they were in civilian clothes, for a

seasoned criminal it is possible to distinguish law enforcement officers from

normal civilians. Under the circumstances, I am not in a position to believe the

evidence of PW-01 and 02 into the manner they claimed that the appellant was

pointed out by the informant.

Page 9 of 14

It was the evidence of the appellant that he was never taken into custody near

the railway crossing as claimed by the witnesses, but while sleeping at his

home. Since the appellant has given evidence under oath and faced the test of

cross-examination, his evidence must be considered giving the same value as

that of the prosecution.

Another matter which concerns this Court is that the alleged information

received by PW-02. The PW-01 in his evidence in chief has stated that the

information received was that a person called Sudu is dealing in Heroin.

However, PW-02 who is the officer alleged to have received the information had

stated about the information in the following manner.

12.40

.

.

(At page 114 of the appeal brief evidence given on 23-04-2015)

If the information received was about a person called Kudu Prabhath and if

PW-02 informed that fact immediately to his superior officer who was PW-01, I

find no reason for PW-01 to give evidence and claim what the PW-02 told him

was that a person called Sudu is dealing in Heroin.

PW-02, has given his evidence in chief on 23-04-2015 and partly subjected to

cross-examination, his further cross-examination had commenced only on 04-

11-2015 more than 4 months after his initial evidence. On the said day,

apparently realizing the discrepancy in the evidence in relation to the

information received, he has spoken about a person called Sudu in the

following manner.

Page 10 of 14

(At page 144 of the appeal brief)

(At page 149 of the appeal brief)

At nowhere in his evidence, PW-02 has explained why he changed his evidence

given in his evidence in chief as to the information received to match what was

stated by PW-01 in his evidence.

Apart from the above, the prosecution witnesses have stated that after the

arrest of the appellant, they took him to his house only to inform a household

member that the appellant was arrested, but they did not search his house. It

is doubtful as to why the raiding party did not search the house of the

appellant after going there, as it would be the normal procedure of PNB officials

when a person is arrested allegedly for trafficking Heroin.

It is the view of this Court that taken all these instances cumulatively, a doubt

invariably would arise in relation to the reliability of the evidence given by the

witnesses in Court.

I am in no position to agree with the contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor

General (DSG) that such hypothetical situations should not be considered as it

can also be the way the witnesses said that the informant engaged with them

and showed the appellant, enabling them to arrest him.

Page 11 of 14

It is the view of this Court that the probability factor of a witness statement is

an essential requirement that needs to be looked at by a trial Court in a

criminal action.

In the case of Alim Vs. Wijesinghe (S.I. Police, Batticaloa) 38 CLW 95, it was

held that,

Where the same facts are capable of an inference in favour of the accused

and also an inference against him, the inference consistent with the

accuseds innocence should be preferred.

I find that the learned High Court Judge in his judgement other than

determining that the evidence does not create a doubt in relation to the

prosecution case, has failed to consider the probability factor of the evidence by

analyzing the evidence of the relevant witnesses in its correct perspective.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has failed to view the evidence of both

parties as a whole and analyze them in its correct perspective to come to his

findings other than considering the evidence separately to each other and

determining that the evidence of the accused and the position taken up by him

cannot be accepted.

In the case of The King Vs. W. P. Buckley 43 NLR 474, it was stated by

Howard, C.J.:

In arriving at a verdict of guilty, the majority of the jury must have viewed

the evidence in sections accepted and convicted the appellant on those

parts that were satisfactory and disregard those facts that pointed to the

improbability of the story put forward by the Crown. The jury should have

viewed the evidence as a whole. If they had done so, we are of opinion

that they must have had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the

appellant. The verdict is in our opinion, unreasonable, in as much as taken

as a whole the evidence does not support the conviction.

Page 12 of 14

It is clear from the judgement that the learned High Court Judge had been

greatly influenced by the weaknesses of the defence case put forward by the

appellant. He has commented extensively about the reasons as to why the

prosecution witnesses had no reason to falsely implicate the appellant. He has

also considered in detail as to why the appellant has failed to complain to a

senior police officer, to the Court, and other relevant agency, if the appellant

was falsely implicated to the charge in determining that the appellants

evidence does not create a reasonable doubt as to the prosecution case.

In other words, it appears that the learned High Court Judge has compared the

evidence of the defence as against the evidence of the prosecution which is a

clear misdirection.

In the case of James Silva Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2 SLR 167,

the trial Judge stated, I had considered the defence of the accused and I hold

that it is untenable and false in the light of the evidence led by the

prosecution.

Held:

There is a serious misdirection in law. It is a grave error for a Trial

Judge to direct himself that he must examine the tenability and

truthfulness of the evidence of the accused in the light of the

evidence led by the prosecution. To examine the evidence of the

accused, in the light of the prosecution witnesses is to reverse the

presumption of innocence. It is also worth mentioning that the

learned High Court Judge has considered the weaknesses of the

defence case extensively in determining that there is no doubt as to

the prosecution case. It is trite law that the prosecution must stand

on its own legs and it cannot derive any strength from the

weaknesses in the defence.

Page 13 of 14

In the case of Kalinga Premathilake Vs. The Director General of the

Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, SC Appeal

No. 99/2007 decided on 30-07-2009, it was held,

What needs consideration now is when the evidence led for the

prosecution in this case is closely scrutinized, whether it would be

satisfied that prosecution had discharged the burden of proving the case

beyond reasonable doubt. If not, the appellant is liable to be acquitted of

the charges. The prosecution must stand or fall on its own legs and it

cannot derive any strength from the weaknesses in the defence, and when

the guilt of the accused is not established beyond reasonable doubt, he is

liable to be acquitted as a matter of right and not as a matter of grace or

favour.

In the Indian case of Narendra Kumar Vs. State (NCT of Delhi), AIR 2012 SC

2281, the Indian Supreme Court held,

Prosecution case has to stand on its own legs and cannot take support

from the weaknesses of the case of defence. However great the suspicion

against the accused and however strong the moral belief and conviction of

the Court, unless the offence of the accused is established beyond

reasonable doubt on the basis of legal evidence and material on the

record, he cannot be convicted for an offence. There is an initial

presumption of innocence of the accused and the prosecution has to bring

home the offence against the accused by reliable evidence. The accused is

entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt.

For the reasons as considered above, I find merit in the considered grounds of

appeal, which entitle the appellant to succeed in his appeal.

Although I find reasonable merit in the 3rd ground of appeal where the

appellant has contended that he was denied of a fair trial because of the

excessive questioning of the appellant when he gave evidence in Court by the

Page 14 of 14

learned trial Judge with a prejudicial mind, I find it would not be necessary to

consider the said ground of appeal further as the appeal by the appellant

would be successful on the earlier considered grounds of appeal.

Accordingly, I allow the appeal and acquit the appellant of the charges for

which he was convicted.

I agree.
