Judgment

The Head Quarters Inspector of the Police station of Matugama had filed an information

under section 66(1)(a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, pursuant to the

complaint made by the 1st Party Respondent against the 2nd Part Respondent.

The learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge having inquired the

dispute between the parties with regard to blocking of a drain, delivered the order on

28.01.2016 directing the 2nd Party Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant to remove the

obstruction made to the drain in question.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the 2nd Party Respondent-Petitioner made an application

by way of revision to the Provincial High Court of Kalutara to revise or set aside the said order

dated 28.01.2016.

The said application was supported on 24.03.2016 before the learned Provincial High Court

Judge of Kalutara. It appears that a lengthy submission was made by the Counsel for the 2nd

Party Respondent-Petitioner and where the counsel urged court to exercise inherent

Jurisdiction of court to take necessary measures to prevent abusing the process of Law.

Furthermore, the Counsel for the 2nd Party Respondent-Petitioner reserved a right to support

for interim relief inter-partes as the application was supported ex-parte and to an order

seeking to issue notice on the 1st Party Respondent-Respondent.

However, the learned High Court Judge reserved the order for 30.03.2016 and pronounced

the said order dismissing Petitioners application without issuing notice on the Respondents

in limine.

It is seen that the learned High Court Judge has made a very short order, which states that,

,

.

,

.

Apparently, the learned High Court Juge has dismissed the said revision application on the

basis that the 2nd Party Respondent-Petitioner had not established any exceptional grounds

to revise the order of the learned Magistrate.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, 2nd Party Respondent-Petitioner, preferred this appeal

to this court seeking to set aside the said order of the learned High Court Judge dated

30.03.2016 and the order made by the learned Magistrate on 28.01.2016.

It is imperative to note that the learned High Court Judge has not analysed and evaluated the

evidence placed before the learned Magistrate. Although the learned High Court Judge had

not stated in his order that the learned Magistrate has come to the correct finding of fact and

law and has come to the correct conclusion to held in favour of the 1st Party Respondent-

Respondent, by dismissing the impugned revision application seems affirmed the order of the

learned Magistrate.

Page 6 of 7

However, when perusing the impugned order of the learned High Court Judge, it is

significant to note that the learned High Court Judge has not given sufficient reasons for

dismissing the revision application of the 2nd Party Respondent-Petitioner. Thus, it is difficult

for this court to determine whether the learned magistrates order is tainted with illegality or

impropriety or any procedural irregularity.

It was emphasized by Obesekara J. in the case of Aluthhewage Harshani Chandrika and

others Vs. Officer in Charge and others [CA PHC 65/2003 C.A.M. 21.04.2020] ;

The Court of Appeal has to look into the matter whether the learned High Court

Judge has properly exercised his duty to ascertain any injustice caused to a party or

whether there is a miscarriage of justice occurred against the Order of the learned

Magistrate and not that the Court of Appeal is empowered to correct the errors made

by the learned Magistrate.

In view of the impugned order of the learned High Court Judge, it is worthy to note that the

learned High Court Judge has not properly exercised his duty to ascertain whether the

learned Magistrate has made any errors in the order, or any injustice caused to a party.

It is noteworthy, the learned High Court Judge had not stated in his order that there is no

injustice caused to any party or there is any miscarriage of justice occurred to any party.

Thus, we do not see how the learned High Court Judge had come to the conclusion that no

exceptional circumstances exist for the 2nd Party Respondent-Petitioner to invoke the

revisionary Jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court.

In our Code of Civil Procedure, ingredients of a judgement have been succinctly explained

in the following manner,

The judgment shall contain a concise statement of the case, the points for

determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for such decision.

In the often-cited case of Dona Lucihamy Vs Ciciliyanahamy 59 NLR 214 it was held that

"Bare answers, without reasons, to issues or points of contest raised in a trial are not

a compliance with the requirements of section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code.

As such, it is the considered opinion of the court regardless of which court the Judge is sitting

at, it is the duty of a judge to set out reasons for his judgement after careful consideration of

the case before him. Even in a revision application before a Judge, if there seems to be prima

facie grounds to consider the existence of exceptional circumstances as alleged by the

Appellant in the instant case, the adjudicator sitting in judgment has a duty to explain his

reasoning behind the refusal to allow such a revision application.

However, impugned Provincial High Court Order which affirm the order of the learned

Magistrate is a skeletal order devoid of any reasoning, which has not given due consideration

to the exceptional circumstances alleged by the Appellant, and no law was referred,

examined or analyzed.

It is my considered view, that the paramount duty of this Court is to safeguard the rights of

the parties before Court. The legal maxim actus curiae neminem gravabit (an act of court

shall prejudice no man) is founded upon justice and good sense in order to administer justice.

Hence, this Court must uphold and enforce the said maxim when it is evident that the act of

court has caused injury to a suitor before court.

Thus, we are of the view that the impugned order of the learned High Court Judge is without

merit and should be set aside.

Therefore, we allow the appeal of the 2nd Party Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant and set aside

the order of the learned High Court Judge dated 30.03.2016.

Hence, we send this case back to the Provincial High Court of Kalutara for the present High

Court Judge to issue notices on the respective parties and take up this case for re-hearing

within four months from the date of this Judgement.

Appeal allowed.
