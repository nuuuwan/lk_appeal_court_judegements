RESPONDENTS

Before: Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

Dhammika Ganepola J.

Counsel: Ravindranath Dabare with Savanthi Ponnamperuma and Imalka Hansani for

the Petitioners.

Avanthi Weerakoon, SC for the 1st, 2A and 7th Respondents.

Argued on : 27.03.2023, 10.07.2023

Decided on : 27.07.2023

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioners seek a writ of certiorari to quash the validity of Cadastral Map No. 512000

Block No.2 Sheet No.1 (marked 'P3') and Cadastral Map No. 512000 Block No.2 Sheet

No.8 (marked 'P4'). They also seek a writ of mandamus to compel the 2nd and 2A

Respondents to correct the Cadastral Maps in dispute and to give effect to Survey Plan

No. 3089 (marked 'P1').

When considering the submissions of the Petitioners in respect of the validity of the

Cadastral Maps marked 'P3' and 'P4', it appears that there is a dispute in the boundaries to

Survey Plan No. 3089 which predates the Cadastral Maps in question. The contention of

the Petitioners, based on the letter marked 'P8', is that there is an apparent error in

Cadastral Map marked 'P4'. The said letter 'P8' has been addressed to the Assistant

Commissioner of Title Settlement, (Gampaha/ Ja Ela/ Wattala) by the Senior

Superintendent of Surveys making a recommendation to the effect of cancelling the said

Cadastral Map No. 512000 Block No.2 Sheet No.8 on the basis that a portion of the public

road has been included into the subject land when issuing certificate No. 0023391. Further,

Page 4 of 7

the said Senior Superintendent of Survey has stated that Lot 57 of Cadastral Map No.

512000 Block No.2 Sheet No.1 has been properly surveyed.

In considering the validity of the Cadastral Map marked 'P4', attention should be drawn

to the letter dated 10.03.2016 (marked 'P9'), letter dated 18.03.2016 (marked P10) and

letter dated 21.03.2016 (marked P11). In comparing the Survey Plan marked P1and the

Cadastral map marked P4, it is the contention of the Petitioners and the 2nd and 2A

Respondents that the Cadastral Map P4 contains a flaw, due to the incorporation of part

of the roadway. In perusing 'P9' to P11 it could be seen that the Assistant Commissioner

of the Land Title Settlement Department (Divisional Office- Gampaha) admits that there

is an error in Cadastral Map marked 'P4'. By virtue of the letters marked P9 to P11 from

the Assistant Commissioner of the Land Title Settlement Department (Divisional Office-

Gampaha) to the 3rd Respondent, it is evident that the authorities are admitting the flaw

in the said Cadastral Map marked 'P4. By P11 the Assistant Commissioner of Land Title

Settlement has taken measures to notify the 3rd Respondent to return the disputed

certificate, for the purpose of correction. It is noted that the 3rd Respondent has already

collected the said disputed certificate (No. 0023391), which stipulates the incorrect

boundaries and that the 3rd Respondent is holding the purported, irregular certificate as at

the date of hearing of the instant Application.

Having perused the letters marked 'P9' to 'P11', it could be contended that there remains

an error in relation to the Cadastral Map marked 'P4', which has been admitted by the

Land Title Settlement Department. Furthermore, by letter dated 03.05.2023 marked 'X'

addressed to the Hon. Attorney General (tendered to Court on 10.07.2023), the Land Title

Settlement Department admits the flaw in the Cadastral Map marked P4. It further states

that they have requested the 3rd Respondent to return the erroneous certificate No.

0023391 for the purpose of effecting these corrections but it has not been returned by the

said 3rd Respondent. Based on the letter marked X it is observed that the Land Title

Settlement Department expects to rectify the said error by way of an order of court.

Now I must advert to the reliefs sought by the Petitioners in the prayer of the Petition of

the Petitioners. The primary reliefs sought by the Petitioners is to issue a writ of certiorari

to quash the validity of the Cadastral Maps marked P3 and P4. Further, the Petitioners

are seeking a writ of mandamus directing the 2nd and 2A Respondents to correct the

Page 5 of 7

Cadastral Map marked P3 and register an amended Cadastral Map under the

Registration of Title Act No.21 of 1998.

It should be noted that the Registrar of the Court of Appeal, via registered post has

attempted to serve notice on the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Respondents, on three occasions. As it

appears on the returned envelopes the said Respondents have refused to accept the letters

on three occasions i.e., 21.12.2021, 22.12.2021 and 23.12.2021. Moreover, the Petitioners

referring to the motion dated 19.07.2022 submitted to Court that the Petitioners would

proceed only against the 1st, 2A and 7th Respondents who are represented by the Attorney

General.

What needs consideration at this stage by this Court is to examine whether it is appropriate

to quash the validity of the Cadastral Maps marked P3 and P4 as prayed for by the

Petitioners merely based on the assertions of the Land Title Settlement Department, which

expressly state that there is an error in 'P4'.

In view of the provisions of the Registration of Title Act No. 21 of 1998, the Commissioner

of Title Settlement after due investigation is empowered to declare any claimant eligible

to be registered with an appropriate class title of ownership. By virtue of Section 22 of the

said Act any claimant aggrieved by any Declaration of the Commissioner of Title

Settlement under Section 14 may prefer an appeal against such declaration within the

prescribed period to the District Court having jurisdiction over the area where the land

parcel is situated. This court is mindful that no party has made any application to the

District Court, under the provisions of the said Section.

Similarly, a question arises whether the Commissioner of Title Settlement has exceeded

his powers or has issued a certificate against the law. It is unique in the instant Application

that the Registrar of Title himself informs Court through the Attorney General that

certificate No. 0023391 has been issued upon erroneous facts, which has surfaced at a

subsequent stage. As mentioned above the Senior Superintendent of Survey by the letter

marked P8 recommends the Assistant Commissioner of Land Title Settlement to cancel

Cadastral Map No. 512000 Block No.2 Sheet No.8.

The 1st, 2nd and 2A Respondents as mentioned above have submitted, that the 3rd

Respondent, in whose custody the disputed certificate is, has refused to adhere to the

request made by the Land Title Settlement Department to return the said certificate.

Page 6 of 7

Furthermore, the Petitioners have sent Letters of demand marked P12(e) to P12(h) to

the 5th, 6th, 4th and 3rd Respondents respectively.

This Court is mindful of the appeal process in Section 22 of the said Registration of Title

Act. It appears that there aren't sufficient provisions in the Registration of Title Act No.

21 of 1998, for the Commissioner General of Title Settlement to deal with a situation as

in the instant Application adequately and efficaciously. In such a situation, if this Court

does not exercise its inherent powers, it would imply that Court is sanctioning an error to

be continued in respect of a decision made by a public authority.

In this regard, the conduct of the 3rd Respondent should also be taken in to consideration

as he has not accepted the notices issued by this court and has failed to adhere to the

request made by the Assistant Commissioner of Land Title Settlement to return the

disputed certificate. In the circumstances, I take the view that this Court should consider

the reliefs prayed for by the Petitioners to a limited extent. I am of the view that the

expressed admission of the error committed by the Commissioner of Land Title Settlement

(P9 to P11) together with the letter marked X and also the recommendations made by

Senior Superintendent of Survey to the Assistant Commissioner of Land Title Settlement

by P8 should be taken into consideration when arriving at the final conclusion in the

instant Application.

Bearing in mind the said admission of error by the Land Title Settlement Department and

the recommendations by the Surveyor Generals Department on a careful consideration of

the whole matter, I have come to the conclusion that by reason of the special circumstances

of this case, I should exercise my discretion to issue a writ of certiorari to quash the validity

Cadastral Map No. 512000 Block No.2 Sheet No.8 and Cadastral Map No. 512000 Block

No.2 Sheet No.1.

At this stage I must draw my attention to the MacFoy Theory (MacFoy vs. United Africa

Co. Ltd. (1961) 3 A.E.R. 1169) which has been applied in the Sri Lankan case of

Rajakulendran vs. Wijesundera (Sriskantha Vol.1 Part 1 1982 page 164). In light of this, I

make an observation that the certificate No. 0023391 has no validity in law once the

Cadastral Maps marked P3 and P4 are quashed by this court.

Page 7 of 7

In addition, I should exercise my discretion to issue a writ of mandamus with appropriate

variation to the scope of the mandamus sought by the Petitioners. Hence, I proceed to

issue a writ of mandamus directing the 2nd and 2A Respondents to conduct a fresh inquiry

under the provisions of the said Act in order to issue a fresh title certificate to the

appropriate owners in respect of the said land.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

Dhammika Ganepola J.

I agree.
