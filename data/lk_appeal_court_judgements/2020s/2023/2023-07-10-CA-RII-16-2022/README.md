This is a revisionary/restitutio in integrum (RII) application by the 3rd defendant-

petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) which seeks to set aside the ex-

parte judgment dated 22/01/2019 and to set aside the order of the learned District

Judge of Nugegoda dated 16/05/2018.

The facts of the case are as follows. The petitioner has been named as the 3rd

defendant in the District Court of Nugegoda in the case bearing No. M2703/2017

and the plaintiff-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff) in the instant

application was the plaintiff in the said DC case No. M 2703/2017. The petitioner

claims that around 03/02/2022 he was informed by the Grama Niladari in the area

that there is a document received from court in his name. The petitioner found that

the said document was an ex-parte decree of the case bearing No. M 2703/2017. The

petitioner states he was totally unaware of the existence of the said case and

thereafter requested a certified copy of the case record from the registry of the

Nugegoda district court. He further emphasized that there was a delay in obtaining

the records due to the extended power cuts in the country.

Petitioner states that due to the above reason he was not able to make a purge default

application as per Section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). The petitioner also

claims that he was not served summons for the said District Court case and further

that the documents considered by the learned District Judge (P9 and P10) are

contrary to each other and thereby claims that the ex-parte judgment is bad in law.

Thereby the petitioner through this RII application claims to set aside the ex-parte

judgment dated 22/01/2019 and to set aside the order of the learned District Judge

dated 16/05/2018.

During the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the petitioner, his main

arguments were relied on the facts that he did not receive summons for the case No.

M 2703/2017 and that the ex-parte judgment by the learned District Judge was

relied on two contradicting documents marked P9 and P10. However, the petitioner

admitted that he received the final ex-parte decree through the Grama Niladari. Yet

it is evident and admitted that the petitioner has not filed purge default applications

to the District Court. The learned Presidents Counsel for the respondents stated that

5

CA-RII- 16-2022 Page 5 of 10 10/07/2023 IJ- 23-23

both summons and ex-parte decree were served yet the petitioner had not taken any

appropriate action to vacate the order.

The attention was brought forward to emphasize on the fact that the petitioner filed

an application to this Court seeking a revision/ restitutio in integrum instead of

filing an application at the District Court.

The Court of Appeal holds a discretionary jurisdiction over revision/ restitutio in

integrum matters, and the court is only deemed to use the discretionary power in

exceptional circumstances when there are no other alternative remedies available for

the parties.

The case of Andradie V Jayasekara Perera 1985 (2) S.L.R. 204 states that the

practice has grown and almost hardened into a rule that where a decree has been

entered ex-parte in a District Court and it sought to be set aside on any ground,

application must in the first instance be made that very court and that it is only

where the finding of the District Court on such application is not consistent with

reason or the proper exercise of the Judge's discretion or where is not consistent with

reason or the proper exercise of the Judge's discretion or where he has misdirected

himself on the facts of law that the Court of Appeal will grant the extraordinary relief

by way of Revision or Restitution in Integrum.

In Rustom V Hapangama 1978/79 (2) S.L.R. 225 it was held that an appellate court

will not exercise its discretion and grant relief by way of revision, where there is an

alternative remedy available unless in exceptional circumstances or there was

something illegal about the order made by the trail Judge which deprived that party

urging the relief by way of revision.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner further reiterated that the reason for not being

able to file purge default papers is due to the crisis in the country at the given time,

he stated that the delay on the part of the Nugegoda District Court Registrar in

issuing the case record of No. M 2703/2017 was due to the continuous power cuts

which prevailed in the country.

Nevertheless, replying to the above point of the petitioner, the learned Presidents

Counsel for the respondents claimed that the said delay was during the outbreak of

the Covid 19 pandemic, and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) (Temporary

6

CA-RII- 16-2022 Page 6 of 10 10/07/2023 IJ- 23-23

Provisions) Act No. 17 of 2021 was in operation for two years commencing from the

1st of March 2020. Thereby the learned Presidents Counsel points out to state that

the petitioners could have used this to validate their argument with regards to the

delay in filing purge default papers to the District Court which is a more binding and

suitable argument.

The learned Presidents Counsel further stated that the most appropriate procedure

for relief would have been to follow the procedure stated in Section 86(2) of the CPC.

The way in which the applications are to be presented to purge the default and the

manner, such an application should be considered is stipulated in Section 86(2) of

CPC.

The said section reads: Where, within fourteen days of the service of the decree

entered against him for default, the defendant with notice to the plaintiff makes

application to and thereafter satisfies court, that he had reasonable grounds for such

default, the court shall set aside the judgment and decree and permit the defendant to

proceed with his defence as from the stage of default upon such terms as to costs or

otherwise as to the court shall appear proper."

In fact, there are many case laws that substantiate the fact that an aggrieved party

to an ex-parte judgment must first file purge default application to the court that

made the order. In Gargial V Somasunderam Chetty 9 N.L.R. 26 it was stated that

a party aggrieved by an ex-parte order should not appeal but should move the court

which passed the order to vacate it. Similarly in the case of Loku Menika V

Selenduhamy 48 N.L.R. 353 held where an order is made ex-parte the proper

procedure to be adopted by the person against whom that order has been made is,

in the first instance, to move the court which made the order to set it aside. In the

case of Dingihamy V Don Bastian 65 N.L.R. 549 it further states that a party

affected by an ex-parte order of which he had no notice must apply in the first

instance to the court, which made the order to rescind the order.

If the petitioner claims that he has not been served with summons he is responsible

for proving his case to satisfy the courts. The petitioner repeatedly argued about the

fact that in the caption of the plaint to the District Court he had been named as the

3rd defendant and his address had been mentioned as No. 105/E, Ehelape Road,

Katuwawala, Borelesgamuwa. However, he strongly emphasized that he had never

7

CA-RII- 16-2022 Page 7 of 10 10/07/2023 IJ- 23-23

lived at the above-mentioned address and that his residential address is No. 115/C,

Katuwawala, Borelesgamuwa; which he claims is certainly two separate addresses.

Thus, on this ground the petitioner claims that he had not been served with

summons for case No. M 2703/2017.

According to the document marked X1, the side note of the journal entry number

02-B dated 28/06/2017 it states: 1,3 . .

.

Correspondingly in the document marked X1 journal entry 03 dated 24/08/2017 it

states:

(ii) 1,3,4 / . . / .

(iii) 1,3 / 1,3 / 4 / '

. . .

Furthermore, the learned District Judge by the order dated 16/05/2018 marked X2

page 3 states 3 1 3

. (Emphasis added)

Thus, stating the above the learned District Judge on 16/05/2018 had fixed an ex-

parte order against the 1,2,3 defendants.

Nevertheless, this Court has no evident proof to verify that the summons had been

served to the hand of the petitioner itself or even to the address provided as the Fiscal

Report has not been included in the appeal brief. Yet the learned District Judge in

his order states that the fiscal has served summons and the judge is satisfied, thus

this Court as per Section 114 (d) of the Evidence Ordinance could presume that the

learned District Judge would have performed the duty of cautiously inspecting the

evidence before stating that summons have been served on the defendant. And

further this Court could also presume that the Fiscal has performed his ordinary

course of duty in serving summons, unless proven otherwise.

8

CA-RII- 16-2022 Page 8 of 10 10/07/2023 IJ- 23-23

Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as below:

The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have

happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct,

and public and private business in their relation to the facts of the particular case.

(d) that judicial and official acts have been regularly performed

If the petitioner wants to rebut the above claim and state that summons was not

served on him, the burden of proof lies on the petitioner himself. This is

substantiated through the case of Sangarapillai V Kathiravelu Sri Kantha Law

Report Vol. II page 99 where it declares that the onus is on the defendant to prove

that the summons was not served on him.

However, if the petitioner successfully satisfies to the courts on a balance of

probability that summons had not been served on him the order would be null and

void. There are many case authorities that support this claim. In Mohammadu

Cassim V Perianam Chetty 14 N.L.R. 385 it stated that a judgement is null and

void and cannot be executed against a person who is not served with summons.

Where summons has not been served at all, an ex-parte judgement against the

defendant is void ab initio and the defendant can challenge its validity at any time

when the judgment so obtained is sought to be used against him either in the same

proceeding or collaterally, provided always that he has not by subsequent conduct

estopped himself by acquiescence, waiver or inaction.

Further in the case of Peter Singho V Wydaman 1983 (2) S.L.R. 238 it was

highlighted that when a defendant complains that summons had not been served on

him and nevertheless a decree had been entered against him, he challenges the

foundation of the default decree. When a defendant attempts to satisfy courts that

the decree against him for default is not based on valid evidence for the finding that

summons was not served on him, he falls within the ambit of section 86(2) of the

CPC.

As suitably pointed out by the learned Presidents Counsel for the respondent, this

court too believes that the petitioner should have relied on section 86(2) of the CPC

as it is the most appropriate alternative remedy for the petitioner rather than

challenging the matter in this court. This could be further substantiated through the

9

CA-RII- 16-2022 Page 9 of 10 10/07/2023 IJ- 23-23

sound argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the respondent, where the

learned Presidents Counsel correctly stated that the petitioner could have filed the

purge default application to the District Court by relying on the special act

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) (Temporary Provisions) Act No. 17 of 2021

which was in operation at the time of the matter, rather than moving to this Court

stating that the delay was due to the continuous power cuts prevailed in the country.

Thus, the learned Presidents Counsel claims that the petitioner has not exercised

the alternative statutory remedies available for the petitioner and thereby the

petitioner is not entitled to any relief in the nature of an application for restitutio in

integrum.

Apart from the argument that summons had not been served on the petitioner, the

petitioner challenged the learned District Judges order on the ground that the order

had been delivered based on two contradicting documents marked P9 and P10.

It was stated and admitted by the petitioner that there was a transaction between

the plaintiff-respondent; the Bank and the 1st defendant-respondent and the

petitioner was the guarantor for the transaction (Document marked P8). Nevertheless,

the petitioner argued that there is a contradiction between P9 and P10 and thereby

stated that the fact the order of the learned District Judge relying on contrary

documents caused substantial miscarriage of justice to the petitioner. Yet the learned

Presidents Counsel during his argument stated that they deny the averment of the

petitioner and states that there is no discrepancy between the documents.

In accordance with ordinary business practices, the respondent Banker maintains

the account ledgers for P9 and P10 documents. The learned District Judge has

acknowledged and accepted these uncontested documents and thus there is no

sufficient justification for the argument of the petitioner to satisfy to courts that the

documents are contrary to each other. Apparently, the P9 and P 10 are based on the

entries of the respondent plaintiffs (Bankers) books. Thus, the Section 90C of the

Evidence Ordinance subject to the provisions in Chapter VI of the Ordinance, enables

that a certified copy of any entry in a banker's book shall in all legal proceedings be

received as prima facie evidence of the existence of such entry, and shall be admitted

as evidence of the matters, transactions, and accounts therein recorded in every case

10

CA-RII- 16-2022 Page 10 of 10 10/07/2023 IJ- 23-23

where, and to the same extent as the original entry itself is now by law admissible,

but not further or otherwise.

Based on the foregoing, it is evident that the petitioner has failed to challenge the

aforementioned order within the prescribed timeframe and through the appropriate

forum. Thus, this Court discerns no manifest illegality or impropriety in the order

issued by the learned District Judge. Hence, this court perceives no ground for

intervening with the District Courts order dated 16/05/2018 and the ex-parte

judgment dated 22/01/2019.

The application is hereby dismissed.
