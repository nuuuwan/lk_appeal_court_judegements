Hon. Justice Menaka Wijesundera

The instant appeal has been filed to set aside the judgment dated 04/08/2021 by the

High Court of Embilipitiya.

The Accused-Appellant had been indicted for two charges of sexual abuse under the

provisions of the Penal Code. When the matter was taken up for argument, the learned

Counsel appearing for the Accused-Appellant stated that he is not contesting the

conviction but only the sentence.

Both parties made submissions to this effect. Upon considering the submissions of the

both parties, this Court back date the sentence to be operative from the date of

conviction which is 04/08/2021.

Subject to the said variation, the instant appeal is dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Hon. Justice B. Sasi Mahendran.

I agree.
