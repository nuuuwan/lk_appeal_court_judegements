Judgment

The Officer-in-charge of the Police Station Avissawella being the informant has filed an

information in case bearing no 92964 on 01.12.2015, in terms of Section 66(1)(a) of the

Primary Court Procedure Act No 44 of 1979, against the 1st and 2nd Party Respondents in

order to prevent breach of peace among the parties. Thereafter, one Mohomed Mansoor

Mohmed Subair had intervened in the said action.

The learned Magistrate acting as the Primary Court Judge had followed the procedure

stipulated in Part VII of the Primary Court Procedure Act and had fixed the matter for inquiry.

At the conclusion of the inquiry the learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court

Judge has delivered the order on 15.03.2016 in favour of the 2nd Party-Respondents.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned Magistrate, the 1st Party-Respondent-

Petitioners had invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court of Western Province

holden in Avissawella in case bearing no 11/2016 (Rev).

Thereafter, the 2nd Party-Respondent-Respondent and the Intervenient-Respondent-

Respondent had filed their objections to the said revision application followed by counter

objections of the 1st Party-Respondent-Petitioner.

After filing of written submissions by all Parties the matter was fixed for order and the learned

High Court Judge delivered the order on 07.12.2018 in favour of the 1st Party-Respondent-

Petitioners revising the said order of the learned Magistrate.

Being aggrieved by the said order the 2nd Party-Respondent-Respondent-Appellant namely

Sooriya Arachchige Maheshika Lakshani and the Intervenient-Respondent-Respondent-

Appellant [hereinafter sometimes jointly referred to as the 1st and 2nd Appellants respectively]

had preferred Appeals bearing case No. CA PHC 210A/2018 and CA PHC 210/2018

respectively to the Court of Appeal.

Factual Background:

It appears that 1st Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Respondents placed affidavit evidence before

the learned Magistrate that 1st Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Respondents were running a

communication center and a sub-post office at the disputed premises which is the subject

matter of the instant action.

It was the position taken up by the 1st Party-1st and 2nd Respondent-Petitioner-Respondents

[hereinafter referred to as the 1st and 2nd Respondents] that they had recruited the 2nd Party-

Respondent-Respondent-Appellant in case CA PHC 210A/2018 [hereinafter referred to as

the 1st Appellant] as an employee to the said business. Since the 1st Appellant was disloyal to

the 1st Respondent, the 1st Appellants services were terminated from his communication

center and the keys of the premises which were in the hands of the1st Appellant were taken

away.

Subsequently, the 1st Appellant had made a complaint to the Police that the 1st Respondent

assaulted the 1st Appellant and as a result of the said altercation 1st Appellant was admitted

to the hospital.

However, after two weeks time the 1st Appellant with the aid of the Police had entered the

disputed premises and she has been in possession of the premises on the day the dispute arose

between the Parties.

It was the position taken up by the 1st Appellant that she was never employed by the 1st

Respondent, instead 1st Appellant had leased the premises in dispute, bearing no 16,

Seethawaka, Avissawella from the 1st Respondent.

It was submitted by the 1st Appellant that the 1st Respondent never entered into a lease

agreement with the 1st Appellant even after she had come into occupation of the disputed

7 of 11

premises. Although the 1st Appellant requested to enter into a lease agreement, 1st Respondent

had deliberately neglected to do so.

Due to the suspicious conduct of the 1st Respondent, 1st Appellant had searched the relevant

folios in respect of the said premises at the land registry and had come to know that the title

holder of the disputed premises is the 2nd-Respondent-Respondent-Appellant in CA PHC

210/2018 namely Mohamed Mansoor Mohamed Subair [hereinafter referred to as the 2nd

Appellant].

In this instance, court observes that the Respondents have not substantiated the said position

that they recruited the 1st Appellant as an employee to their Communication shop and that

1st Appellants services were terminated.

Thereafter, the 1st Appellant had entered into a lease agreement with the 2nd Appellant in

respect of the said disputed premises on 26.10.2015.

In view of the evidence placed before the learned Magistrate, it is seen that the dispute relates

to possession of the premises, thus it comes within the purview of section 68(1) or section

68(3) of the Primary Court Procedure Act and as such, court must determine,

a) who was in possession on the date of filing of the information, or

b) if theres any dispossession, who was in possession of the disputed premises within

two months prior to the date of filing of the information,

and to protect his/her possession until the matter is adjudicated before a competent civil

court.

It is worthy to note that the learned Magistrate by order dated 15.03.2016 held that, the 1st

Appellant was in possession of the disputed premises until the information was filed on

01.12.2015, thus she is entitled to the possession of the disputed premises.

However, the learned High Court Judge has revised the said order of the learned Magistrate

and held that the 1st and 2nd Respondents are entitled to the possession of the said premises

in dispute as they were in possession of the disputed premises on the date of filing of the

information.

It appears that the learned High Court Judge had come to the conclusion that the 1st Appellant

had operated her business namely Mahesihka Communication at no 29, Seeethawaka,

Avissawella and not in the premises in dispute bearing no 16, Seethawaka Road, Avissawella.

8 of 11

Furthermore, the learned high Court Judge has taken into consideration that the lease

agreement dated 26.10.2015 entered by the Appellants had been executed after the date on

which the dispute has arisen on 16.10.2015.

It is clear that since the dispute relates to premises bearing no 16, Seethawaka Road,

Avissawella, the matter in issue falls within the ambit of section 68 of the Primary Court

Procedure Act.

In view of the Complaint made to the Police by the 1st Appellant on 16.10.2015 and the

statements made by the 1st Respondent on 02.11.2015 and 17.11.2015, the incident took

place on or about 09.10.2015, and the 1st Appellant was in the possession of the disputed

premises against the approval of the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

It is observable that the Respondents had complained to the Police only on 02.11.2015 after

the complaint made by the 1st Appellant on 16.10.2015 to the Police about forcible

dispossession of the 1st Appellant by the 1st and 2nd Respondent from the disputed premises.

It is significant to note that 1st and 2nd Respondents did not make any complaints to the Police

regarding the said incident until the 1st Appellant made the complaint to the Police regarding

the unlawful dispossession.

According to the complaint dated 16.10.2015 by the 1st Appellant,

, (communication) , computer,

photocopy machine,

Police Statement by the 1st Respondent (Suminda Wijeratna) on 02.11.2015 stated that,

2014.10.16 .

Hence, it is evident that the 1st Appellant was in possession of the disputed premises in some

capacity until 16.10.2015.

According to the Affidavit of the 1st Respondent,

2015.10.19

.

.

Furthermore, the 2nd Respondent has stated in her statement dated 17.11.2015 has states

that,

(communication)

However, it is in evidence that after the preliminary inquiry and site inspection by the Police,

possession was handed over back to the 1st Appellant and that, the 1st and 2nd Respondents

have asked for possession of the disputed property by complaints dated 02.11.2015 and on

17.11.2015.

It is also relevant to note that the key to the disputed premises had been forcibly taken by the

1st Respondent from the 1st Appellant which amounts to a dispossession. However, it is

evident that the 1st Appellants possession was restored on 19.10.2015.

Now I will consider the findings of the learned High Court Judge with regard to the impugned

dispute between the Parties. Accordingly, it is stated in the order that,

In this instance, court observes that the said finding of the learned High Court Judge is

erroneous. The learned high Court Judge has misdirected himself and had come to a wrong

conclusion that the 1st Appellant had been running a Communication at her residence no 29,

Seethawaka, Avissawella.

The learned High Court judge has failed to observe that the 1st Appellant was initially running

a Communication at no 29, Seethawaka, Avissawella and subsequently it was shifted to no

16, Seethawaka, Avissawella [to the disputed premises] based on an oral agreement with the

Respondents.

Therefore, it is apparent that the 1st Appellant had been running the communication shop at

the disputed premises on her own and not as an agent of the Respondents.

The court draws the attention to the statement made on 16.10.2015 (the date of the incident)

by Milton Wijetunga,

communication .

It is observed that the said Complaint was made on the date on which the dispute arose, and

it is seems that the 1st Appellant was forcefully ousted by the 1st Respondent in a violent

manner, which is not permitted under the law. The contention of the 1st Appellant was

substantiated in the said Complaint as well.

Thus, it is apparent that the learned Magistrate had duly analysed and evaluated the evidence

placed before him and had come to correct findings of fact and law and determined that 1st

Appellant was in possession of the disputed premises on the date of filing of the information

and determined the matter in terms of section 68(1) and (3)

Therefore, I hold that the learned High Court Judge had come to an erroneous conclusion

and set aside the order of the learned Magistrate.

Thus, we set aside the order dated 07.12.2018 by the learned High Court Judge and affirm

the order dated 15.03.2016 by the learned Magistrate. Hence, we allow both appeals

preferred by 1st and 2nd Appellants.

Both Appeals are allowed.
