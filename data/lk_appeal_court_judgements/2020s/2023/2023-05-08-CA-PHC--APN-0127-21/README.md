Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an application in revision by the petitioner-petitioner namely, Dawunda

Wickrama Rajapaksa Wasala Munasinghe Mudiyanse Ralahamilage

Rambukwelle Walawwe Ishan Udayanga, being aggrieved by the order dated 05-

08-2021 of the learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya.

The petitioner-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) has stood

surety for the accused in the High Court of Embilipitiya Case Number 53-2023

for a sum of Rs. One Million. Along with the petitioner, two other persons have

also stood surety for the accused for the same amount. The accused in the above

case has absconded the Court, and accordingly, after holding a due inquiry in

Page 4 of 8

terms of section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, the

learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya has decided to proceed with the trial

against the accused in his absence.

Consequent to that, the learned High Court Judge has allowed the three sureties

to show cause as to why their surety bail bonds should not be forfeited. After

hearing the petitioner and the 2nd surety, the learned High Court Judge, being

satisfied that they have failed to show sufficient cause as to why their bail bonds

should not be forfeited, had made the following order.

The petitioner has come before this Court seeking to challenge the above order

of the learned High Court Judge by way of a revision application on the basis

that the procedure followed by the learned High Court Judge after deciding to

forfeit the bail bond was not according to the law, and hence, it amounts to an

illegal order.

In other words, the petitioner has not challenged the decision to forfeit his bail

bond, but the recovery procedure the learned High Court Judge has decided to

follow in the above-mentioned order.

For matters of clarity, I would now reproduce in its entirety, the relevant section

422 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, which provides for the procedure on

forfeiture of bonds.

422 (1) Whenever it is proved to the satisfaction of the court by which

a bond under this code has been taken, or when the bond is for

appearance before a court to the satisfaction of such court that bond

has been forfeited, the court shall record the grounds of such proof

and may call upon any person bound by such bond, to pay the penalty

thereof or to show cause why it should not be paid.

(2) If sufficient cause is not shown and the penalty is not paid

the court may proceed to recover the same by issuing a warrant for

the attachment and sale of the movable or immovable property

belonging to such person.

(3) Such warrant may be executed within the local limits of the

jurisdiction of the court which issued it and it shall authorize the

distress and sale of any movable or immovable property belonging to

such person without such limits when endorsed by the Judge within

the local limits of whose jurisdiction such property is found.

(4) If such penalty be not paid and cannot be recovered by such

attachment and sale the person so bound shall be liable by order of

Page 6 of 8

the court which issued the warrant to simple imprisonment for a term

which may extend to six months.

(5) The court may at its discretion remit any portion of the

penalty mentioned and enforce payment in part only.

It is abundantly clear that in terms of section 422(2), once it is decided to forfeit

a bail bond, the 1st mode of recovery shall be by issuing a warrant for the

attachment and sale of the movable or immovable property belonging to the

person against whom the forfeiture order was made.

In accordance with subsection (4) of the same section, it is only if such penalty

still not been paid, and cannot be recovered by such an attachment, a Court can

sentence a person for a period of 6 months simple imprisonment.

In the case of Kaluarachchige Chandrasoma Vs. The Attorney General

CA(PHC) APN 133/12 decided on 06-11-2012, A.W.A. Salaam, J. (as he was

then) held that any forfeiture of a bail bond should be done in accordance with

the specific provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act as provided for in

section 422.

In the case of Manohar Aranraj and Mahalingam Gopinaath Vs. The Attorney

General, decided on 21-09-2017, Sisira De Abrew, J. in agreement with Nalin

Perera, J. (as he was then) and Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C., J. held that a

Magistrate is empowered to act under section 422 (4) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, only after he complied with section 422 (2) of the CPC.

His Lordship took guidance from the case of De Silva Vs. S.I. Police Kandy 63

C.L.W. page 109, which states;

The order for forfeiture should be set aside as the learned Magistrate has

failed to comply with the provisions of section 411 (1) and (4) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act. He should have recorded the grounds of proof that

the bond had been forfeited and it is only if the penalty cannot be recovered

Page 7 of 8

by attachment and sale that he could have imposed the sentence on him for

imprisonment.

Per Sisira De Abrew, J.

Section 441 of the old CPC has been reproduced as section 422 (4) of the

CPC. As I observed earlier, the learned Magistrate had failed to comply with

section 422 (1) (2) of the CPC. Therefore, he could not have acted under

section 422 (4) of the CPC. It appears that the learned Magistrate was too

quick in sentencing the appellants.

It is my considered view that although the above-considered case was in relation

to a Magistrate Court order, the applicable provision in the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act is the same. I find that although the learned High Court Judge

has correctly followed the procedural steps as mentioned in section 422(1) of the

Code, the learned High Court Judge was misdirected when it was ordered that

in default of paying the sum mentioned in the bail bond, the petitioner shall

serve a prison term of two years.

As considered above, the learned High Court Judge should have ordered the

attachment and sale as provided for in section 422(2) and if it fails only, the

provisions of section 422(4) should have been applied. There again, the penalty

should have been for a simple imprisonment term which may extend up to 6

months and not as ordered by the learned High Court Judge.

Under the circumstances, this Court has no option but to set aside the learned

High Court Judges order up to the extent of vacating the order where it was

stated that the forfeited amount should be recovered as a fine and in default, the

petitioner shall serve a two-year prison term.

The learned High Court Judge is directed to follow the provisions of section

422(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act in order to recover the forfeited

amount and to act under section 422(4) only if the amount cannot be recovered

in terms of section 422(2).

The application of the petitioner is allowed up to the above extent.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to forward this judgement to the High Court

of Embilipitiya for necessary implementation.
