Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted before

the High Court of Batticaloa for having committed the offence of murder of one Mohomed

Subair Athm Abul Sathar alias Riyal (the Deceased) an offence made punishable under

Section 296 of the Penal Code.

Prosecution led the evidence of six witnesses and production marked as P1 to P6. The

Accused made a dock statement. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge

by his judgement dated 2nd of September 2016 found the Accused guilty for murder,

convicting him, and imposed the death sentence.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction the Accused has appealed to this court.

As this case is based on circumstantial evidence, we are thereby guided by the

well-established principles of law on circumstantial evidence.

In the case of Hanumant Govind Nargundkar and another v. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1952 SC 343 at Page 345, Mahajan, J held that ,

In dealing with circumstantial evidence the rules specially applicable to such evidence

must be borne in mind. In such cases there is always the danger that conjecture or suspicion

may take the place of legal proof and therefore, it is right to recall the warning addressed by

Baron Alderson, to the jury in Reg v. Hodge ((1838) 2 Lew. 227), where he said :-

"The mind was apt to take a pleasure in adapting circumstances to one another, and

even in straining them a little, if need be, to force them to from parts of one connected whole;

and the more ingenious the mind of the individual, the more likely was it, considering such

matters to overreach and mislead itself, to supply some little link that is wanting, to take for

granted some fact consistent with its previous theories and necessary to render them

complete."

It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature,

the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first

instance be fully established, and all the facts so established should be consistent only with

the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. Again, the circumstances should be of a conclusive

nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one

proposed to be proved. In other words, there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as

not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the

accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have

been done by the accused.

In the case of Sudu Hakuruge Jamis and 1 Other v. The Attorney General, CA

204/2010 ,decided on 13.11.2013, Sisira De Abrew, J held;

Applying the principles laid down in the above judicial decisions, I hold that in

a case of circumstantial evidence if the Court is going to arrive at a conclusion that

the accused is guilty of the offence, such an inference must be the one and only

irresistible and inescapable conclusion that the accused himself committed the crime.

Further I hold that if the proved facts are not consistent with the guilt of the accused,

he must be acquitted

This was further analysed in the case of H.K.K.Habakkala v. Attorney General CA

Appeal 107/2005, his Lordship Sisira De Abrew, J held that:

The case against the appellant entirely depended on circumstantial evidence. Therefore it

is necessary to consider the principles governing cases of circumstantial evidence. In his

judgement he had referred the following case of Don Sunny v. AG 1998 2 SLR Page 1

Gunasekara J held that

1. when a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the proved items

of circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point towards

the only inference that the accused committed the offence. On a consideration of all

the evidence the only inference that can be arrived

at should be consistent with the guilt of the accused only.

2. If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence if an inference can be

drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, then

one cannot say that the charges have been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

3. If upon a consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence if the only

inference that can be drawn is that the accused committed the offence then they can

be found guilty.

The following evidence was led by the prosecution to prove the charge of murder:

The Accused and the Deceased were employed at a hotel in Ottamavady and resided

in a house rented by the hotel's owner (PW1).

According to PW1, concerned that the Deceased had not reported for work, he visited

the house where the Deceased was residing. Upon arrival, he found the door padlocked. After

failing to reach the Deceased via his switched-off mobile phone, PW1 forcibly entered the

premises, discovering the body of the Deceased. He reported that he had given some money

to the Deceased the previous day. Upon discovery he immediately informed the police. The

Page 5 of 5

following police investigation led to the arrest of the Accused, who was found in possession of

a set of keys to the house and a mobile phone.

Conversely, the defense asserted that the Accused had left the residence, leaving

behind his bicycle, to stay at his cousin's house. He claimed that there had been no animosity

between him and the Deceased.

Upon considering the evidence presented by the prosecution, it becomes clear that

there is no direct evidence against the Accused. While both the Deceased and the Accused

resided in the same house and the Accused was found with a set of keys and a Nokia

cellphone, there is no substantiated evidence to prove that the phone belonged to the

Deceased.

Additionally, we observe that there is no evidence to suggest that no other person

lived in or visited the house at that time. Moreover, no evidence exists to show that only the

Deceased and the Accused had keys to the residence.

I am of the opinion that the prosecution has failed to establish sufficient evidence. The

only inescapable conclusion is that the Accused is not proven to have committed the murder

of Mohomed Subair Athm Abul Sathar.

Therefore, we hold that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt

that the Accused committed the murder. Accordingly, we set aside the conviction and

sentence, and we acquit the Accused.

This Appeal is allowed.
