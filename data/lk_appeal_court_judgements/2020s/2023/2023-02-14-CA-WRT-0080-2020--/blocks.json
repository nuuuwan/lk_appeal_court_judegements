Chandrawathi Jayasingha, Notary Public marked as P1, the Petitioners father, namely Kalahe Palliya Guruge Gunadasa alias Gunasekera became the owner of the land called Welipennagahahena in extent of A0-R01-P20. By deed bearing No. 495 dated 06-10-2009 attested by S. S. C. De Silva, Notary Public marked P2, the said Kalahe Palliya Guruge Gunadasa alias Gunasekera gifted his right to the Petitioner. Subsequently, the said land had been acquired by the State for the expansion of the playground of the Junior School, Pinikahana. The vesting Order was published in the Government Gazette No. 269 dated 13-10-1978 marked as P11. Under section 38 (a) of the Land Acquisition Act, by the Gazette marked P11, the Land Officer of Galle District had been empowered by the Minister of Land to take possession of the same immediately on the ground of urgency. The Petitioner states that, however, the possession of the land has not been taken over by the State. The Petitioner further states that he is entitled to expect legitimately that the land will be divested, on the basis that by letter dated 04-12-2019 (P16), the Minister of Land requested the Divisional Secretary, Elpitiya, to stay taking possession of the land until the possibility of divesting would be considered, and the Governor of the Southern Province by letter dated 13-01-2020 (P20) requested the Secretary to the Ministry of Education, Southern Province to take steps to divest the said land to the Petitioner. It is averred in paragraph 38 of the amended Petition that, by letter dated 02-03-2020 (P21), the Divisional Secretary of Elpitiya had taken steps to take over the possession of the land in dispute, and therefore, the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st Respondent to revoke the vesting Order No. 269 dated 13-10-1978 acting under Section 39 (1) of the Land Acquisition Ordinance and Writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st Respondent to divest the land which the Petitioner claims under Section 39 (A) of the Ordinance.",

If there was an immense threat, he need not wait for such a long period to come before Court. Thus, it is an undisputed fact that there is a long delay on the part of the Petitioner in invoking the Writ jurisdiction of this Court. In this regard, I refer to the observation made by the Supreme Court in the case of D.D. Kaluarachchi Vs. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (SC. Appeal No. 43/2013, SC Minute dated 19-06-2019). This is the case where five years after their retirement, four former employees of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation filed an Application for Writs before the Court of Appeal and moved the Court for Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus in respect of certain salary arrears. The Court of Appeal issued a Writ of Mandamus directing the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation to pay the Petitioners certain salary arrears. Murdu Fernando, J. agreeing with Sisira de Abrew and Vijith Malalgoda JJ., observed that;",

The exercise of this discretion by Court is governed by certain well-accepted principles. The Court is bound to issue it at the instance of a party aggrieved by the order of an inferior tribunal except in cases where he has disentitled himself to the discretionary relief by reason of his own conduct, submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay or waiver. The proposition that the Application for Writ must be sought as soon as the injury is caused is merely an Application of the equitable doctrine that delay defeats equity and the longer the injured person sleeps over his rights without any reasonable excuse the chance of his success in Writ Application dwindles and the Court may reject a Writ Application on the ground of unexplained delay. An Application for a Writ of Certiorari should be filled within a reasonable time\"",
