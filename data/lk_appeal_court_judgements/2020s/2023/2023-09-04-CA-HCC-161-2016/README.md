The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted at the

High Court of Batticaloa for the following counts:

a) For being in possession of a T-56 gun without a license, an offence punishable

under Section 22(3) read with Section 22(1) of the Firearms Act No.33 of 1966 as

amended by Act No. 22 of 1996.

b) At the same time and course of the same transaction for the possession of 29 live

bullets without lawful authority under Section 9(2) read with Section 27(1)(a) of

Explosives Act No. 21 of 1961. As amended by Act No. 33 of 1969.

Prosecution led evidence from ten witnesses, marking productions P1 to P7, and

closed their case. The Accused had given a dock statement After the conclusion of the trial,

the Learned High Court Judge pronounced the Accused guilty of both counts, For the 1st

Count- he was imposed life imprisonment, and for the 2nd Count - 2 years of rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 LKR.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Accused

preferred this appeal to this Court.

The Following are the Grounds of Appeal set out by the Counsel in the written submission:

1. Conviction is untenable as the prosecution has not established exclusive

possession on the part of the Appellant.

2. Evidence of PW/10 namely Gamini Jayantha is self-contradictory, erratic, and

wholly unreliable casting a serious doubt in the prosecution case.

3. The Learned Trial Judge had totally failed to address his judicial mind to the

serious infirmities in the evidence of PW10 namely Gamini Jayantha.

4. Conflict of evidence between PW10 namely Gamini Jayantha and PW9 namely

Chandrasegara creates a serious doubt in the prosecution case.

5. The Learned Trial Judge has been totally oblivious to the aforementioned

contradictory evidence between PW10 and PW9.

6. Evidence relating to the identification of the T56 weapon is infirm and the

prosecution has failed to establish its identity beyond reasonable doubt.

According to PW1, Chief Inspector Mahindasiri, on the 14th day of June 2009,

acting upon credible information furnished by Police Constable 65042 Thaha (PW7), a

search operation was launched targeting the residence of the Accused. Subsequent to

interrogation and the recording of the Accused's statement, a T-56 firearm bearing serial

number 4015699 was recovered. This weapon was accompanied by 29 rounds of 7.62mm

caliber ammunition and two magazines, all of which were concealed within a rice bag and

buried under the floor of a hen cage situated within the Accused's premises. It is pertinent

to note that the said firearm and associated articles exhibited signs of oxidation;

specifically, the serial number of the weapon was partially obscured, though digits 0, 6,

and 9 remained discernible. This evidence was later challenged by the defense, and the

Accused denied any allegations pertaining to the aforementioned firearm.

The Accused and the recovered items were taken to the police station and handed

over to Police Constable 64265 Karunasena, subsequent to their entry in the production

record under number 102/2009.

The evidence of PW6, P.C 55693 Karupaiyah Ambalagan, corroborates that of

PW1. According to PW6, at approximately 12:30 p.m. on the same date, an individual

named Amsar was arrested for illegal possession of a T-56 firearm and a magazine. While

transporting Amsar in the police jeep, PW1 informed the officers that another arrest

specifically, of one Abdul Majeed or Master Raheem (the Accused) was to be conducted for

a similar offense. Pursuant to this directive, the Accused was arrested at his residence,

and the aforementioned T-56 firearm and ammunition were recovered.

PW7, Police Sergeant 65042 Mohamed Thaha, revealed that on the specified date,

a total of three firearms were recovered from different individuals.

Inspector of Police Gamini Jayantha, identified as PW10, testified that he received

the impounded T-56 firearm, bearing serial number 4015899, along with two magazines

and 29 rounds of ammunition, on the 24th of September 2009. This production was

received from the officer in charge of production at the police station, whose identity and

service number were conspicuously absent in the Production Record (PR) book.

On the following day, 25th of September 2009, PW10 handed over these items to

the Government Analyst Department, for which he received a receipt bearing the

Page 4 of 5

reference number CF/373/09. He noted that the firearm was not in a packed condition at

the time of this handover. Furthermore, PW10 stated that he had affixed his signature to

the production register to acknowledge this handover; however, this register was not

produced before the court for examination or corroboration.

During cross-examination, PW10 initially indicated uncertainty regarding

whether the productions were packed and sealed as one parcel. However, when later

questioned by the court, he recanted his prior statement, asserting that he had in fact

packed it as a single parcel. Later he stated that P.C 31235 Ranjith (PW9) had taken

custody of the production to hand it over to the Government Analyst Department.

When we peruse this witness's evidence it is evident that he has contradicted his

own evidence by giving a different version. The Learned Trial Judge had failed to consider

this evidence.

PW9 testified that upon receiving instructions from PW1, he was responsible for

delivering the packaged evidence, registered under production PR 102/2009, to the

Government Analyst Department. He performed this task on the 25th of September 2009

and obtained a corresponding receipt. Interestingly, he also confirmed that this

production was previously handed over to the Magistrate Court on the 4th of August 2009,

under B report no. B/813/09. This adds another layer of complexity to the case, as the

production was reportedly packed in such a manner that the contents were not visible,

creating further uncertainties in the chain of custody.

Further in his cross examination, he testified that when the productions were

handed over to the Court on 4/08/2009 they were packed separately.

Upon analysis, it is evident that a glaring discrepancy exists between the

testimonies of PW1, PW9 and PW10 regarding the T-56 gun's serial number and the

conditions under which the evidence was maintained. PW10 asserts that he handed over

a T-56 gun bearing the serial number 4015899 to the Government Analyst Department

on the 25th of September 2009. This evidence is in direct conflict with the earlier account

provided by PW1, who stated that the serial number of the confiscated T-56 gun was

4015699.

When this discrepancy was flagged for the court's attention, the Learned Trial

Judge dismissed this objection. The ruling stated that establishing the chain of custody

was not critical to the case since the recovered production was a firearm.

The Learned Trial Judges conclusion that the chain of custody is inconsequential

due to the nature of the recovered production being a firearm is flawed. This is a

precarious position to adopt, especially when the very purpose of forwarding the recovered

item to a government analyst was to ascertain its categorization under the Firearms

Ordinance.

We are mindful that for these reasons our courts are insisting that there should be

evidence to prove the chain of custody.

One of the most glaring irregularities, in this case, is the differing serial numbers

cited by PW1 and the individual who had taken the firearm to the Government Analyst.

PW1 claimed that the recovered T-56 gun bore the serial number 4015699, whereas the

later record by the Government Analyst indicated the number as 4015899. This

divergence in serial numbers is not a trivial matter; it goes to the heart of the cases

integrity.

Shockingly, this discrepancy was not given due consideration by the Learned Trial

Judge. Instead, it appears that this substantial infirmity was summarily dismissed,

without a proper investigation into why such a glaring inconsistency was present in the

first place.

We hold that this discrepancy totally goes to the root of the case, for the above-said

reason we hold that the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.

Therefore, we set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the High Court of

Batticaloa on the 25th of July 2016. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.
