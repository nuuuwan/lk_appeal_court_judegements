JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred as the Appellant)

being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence imposed on him on

12/03/2015 by the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo, preferred this

appeal to this Court well within time.

The Appellant was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo under Sections 54A (d) and 54A (b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No.13 of 1984 for

Possession and Trafficking respectively of 51.9 grams of Heroin

(Diacetylmorphine) on 19th October 1999.

As the Appellant absconded before the closer of prosecution case, an inquiry

under Section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 was

held and the Learned Trial Judge continued the case in absentia of the

Appellant.

Prosecution had closed the case on 27.10.2009 and on the same date the

Appellant through an Attorney-at-Law filed a letter of authority and

commenced to appear on behalf of the Appellant.

3 | P a g e

When the defence was called, the Appellant called two defence witnesses and

closed the case. After trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts

and the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo has imposed the death

penalty on each count on 12/03/2015.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. During the argument he was connected via Zoom platform from

prison.

The Learned Counsel, on behalf of the Appellant had raised following

appeal grounds.

1. The version of the defence was rejected contrary to law and the

principles of evaluating the defence.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to judicially scrutinize the

version of the defence.

3. The Learned High Court Judge permitted illegal and inadmissible

evidence including evidence of bad character of the accused causing

grave miscarriage of justice.

4. The presumption of innocence was reversed by the Learned Trial Judge

denying the right to a fair trial.

5. The prosecution and the defence were not treated with equality of

arms.

6. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to apply the long held dictas

and principles in evaluating the evidence of trained police officers and

disregarded the contradictions inter se and per se causing grave

miscarriage of justice.

7. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to appreciate the

discrepancies of the productions itself as described by the prosecution.

8. The production chain has not been proved.

9. The judgment is contrary to law and against the weight of the evidence

adduced in the case.

4 | P a g e

At the trial, PW1 IP/Liyanage, PW3 PS 30762 Senaratne, PW04 SI/Perera,

PW05 Government Analyst and PW06 Assistant Government Analyst were

called by the prosecution to give evidence on behalf of the prosecution.

Further, the prosecution had marked productions P1-P10. Two witnesses

were called by the Appellant on his behalf.

Background of the case

PW1 was attached to the Police Narcotic Bureau when he arranged the

detection pertaining to this case. Upon receiving information from a personal

informant about trafficking of Heroin, PW1 having selected a group of police

officers had left the Bureau after completing all formalities. They had gone

to a housing scheme named Samagipura at Kosgashandiya in Grandpass

with the informant.

After arriving at the location, the informant had showed them a person clad

in a sarong and a short leave shirt as the person who was carrying Heroin.

When the person showed by the informant reached up to them, he was

questioned and searched. Upon search, PW1 had felt something was

underneath in his underwear. As per the direction the Appellant had

removed a parcel which was wrapped in a cellophane cover and handed over

to PW1.Upon checking further, PW1 had found another parcel which too was

wrapped in a cellophane paper. When PW1 had examined the substance

contained in the parcels and identified Heroin in both parcels. The Appellant

was taken to his house but nothing illegal had been recovered there.

Thereafter, the Appellant was brought to the Police Narcotic Bureau.

Another person named Jamaldeen Roomy was also arrested at that time. A

packet of Heroin was recovered from his possession. He was charged in the

Magistrate Court.

5 | P a g e

The weight of two parcels was recorded as 103.600 grams and 41.400 grams

respectively and were entered under PR No. 78/99.

The Substances which were recovered were handed over to the Police

Narcotic Bureaus production officer PW SI/Perera on 19/10/1999.

PW3, PS/30762 Senaratne had corroborated the evidence given by PW1

IP/Liyanage.

The productions alleged to have been recovered from the Appellant had been

sent to the Government Analyst Department. According to the Government

Analysts Report, the total weight of pure Heroin (diacetylmorphine) detected

from the brown coloured powder was 51.9 grams.

When the prosecution closed the case after leading the prosecution witnesses

mentioned above, the defence was called, and the Appellant had called two

witnesses for his defence. The Appellants wife admitted that the Appellant

was arrested by officers of the Police Narcotic Bureau at his house, but

categorically denies recovering Heroin from his possession as claimed by the

prosecution.

The person who was arrested along with the Appellant gave evidence on

behalf of the Appellant. According to him, he was also arrested on the date

the Appellant was arrested and was taken to the Appellants house. The

Appellant had been assaulted by the police at the Appellants house. In the

cross examination admitted that he had been serving a life sentence for the

possession of Heroin recovered from his house.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant, although had filed 09 grounds of

appeal argued this appeal under two grounds after evaluating all the

grounds. The said two grounds are set out below:

1. The Appellant had been denied a fair trial.

2. The production chain has not been proved.

6 | P a g e

This Court has already held in the case of Devage Thusitha Chamara alias

Thilan v. The Attorney General CA/HCC/0050/2020 decided on

01/11/2022 the importance of adhering to fair trial concept in a criminal

trail which had been guaranteed under the Constitution. The relevant

portion of the judgment is reproduced below:

The concept of fair trial is a fundamental principle in every judicial

system. In another sense, the notion of a fair trial secures justice. A trial

in criminal jurisprudence is a judicial examination or determination of

the issues at the hand of the Court to arrive at a conclusion whether the

accused is guilty of the offence or not.

The single most important criterion in evaluating the fairness of a trial

is the observance of the principle of equality of arms between the

defence and the prosecution. Equality of arms, which must be observed

throughout the trial, means that both parties are treated in a manner

ensuring their procedurally equal position during the course of a trial.

When the defence was called on behalf of the Appellant, his wife and the

other person who was arrested when the Appellant was arrested on the date

of incident gave evidence on behalf of the Appellant. According to the wife of

the Appellant, the Appellant was arrested at his resident by the police. After

being beating severely, the Appellant was taken away by the police. Before

leaving, the police had requested two underwear from this witness. When

provided the police had told the Appellant to wear one and the other was put

into a bag and taken away by the police.

In her evidence it was elicited that the Appellant had gone to India due to

fear while this case was pending. During the cross examination, the Learned

State Counsel suggested to the defence witness that the Appellant had

escaped to India due to this pending case. Several portions of evidence of

7 | P a g e

defence witness number 01 have been highlighted by the Learned Counsel

for the Appellant. Those portions are re-produced below:

The Learned Counsel contended that the Learned High Court Judge had

allowed the prosecution to lead bad character evidence under Section 54 of

the Evidence Ordinance thereby acting on those evidence and had

erroneously misdirected himself and denied a fair trial.

Section 54 of the Evidence Ordinance states:

In criminal proceedings the fact that the accused person has a bad

character is irrelevant, unless evidence has been given that he has a good

character, in which case it becomes relevant.

Explanation 1.- This section does not apply to cases in which the bad

character of any person is itself a fact in issue.

Explanation 2.- A previous conviction is relevant as evidence of bad

character in such case.

9 | P a g e

In R.G.Moses v. The Queen 75 NLR 121 the Court held:

that the conviction of the Appellant must be quashed on the ground

that the evidence of the previous conviction, which was inadmissible

according to Section 54 of the Evidence Ordinance, had been taken into

account in the trial judges judgment and was in a high degree

prejudicial to the Appellant. In such a case the substantial question is

whether or not the accused has been deprived a fair trial.

The above cited portions of evidence clearly indicate that the bad character

evidence had creeped into the proceedings. This has caused prejudice and

denial of a fair trial to the Appellant.

As stated earlier, on behalf of the Appellant two witnesses had given

evidence. Those evidence also demand an equal consideration of the court.

In Kithsiri v. Attorney General [2014] 1 SLR 38 the court held that:

[1] Courts evaluating evidence should not look at the evidence of the

accused person with a scant eye. Defence witnesses are entitled to

equal treatment with those of the prosecution and Courts ought to

overcome their traditional instinctive belief in defence witnesses. Quite

often they tell lies but so do the prosecution.

In the case of Shiv Kumar v. Hukam Chand and Anr [1999] 7 SCC 104 the

court observed that:

The expected attitude of the Public Prosecutor while conducting

prosecution must be couched in fairness not only to the Court and to the

investigating agencies but to the accused as well. If an accused is

entitled to any legitimate benefit during trial the Public Prosecutor should

10 | P a g e

not scuttle/conceal it. On the contrary, it is the duty of the Public

Prosecutor to winch it to the force and make it available to the accused.

Even if the defence counsel overlooked it, Public Prosecutor has the

added responsibility to bring it to the notice of the Court if it comes to his

knowledge

The Learned High Court Judge had simply rejected the defences evidence

because the Appellant had not adduced evidence personally. The relevant

portion of the judgment is re-produced below:

(Pages 605-606 of the brief)

;a;slre fuu idslref.a idsh inkaOfhka ia:djrhla f.k ke;' ukao ;a;slre

This is a clear misdirection which certainly affects the fair trial. In this case

when the defence was called the Appellant had absconded and the trial had

been fixed in absentia of him thereafter. Even when the Appellant is present,

he has the statutory right remain silent. Hence, the absence to adduce

evidence personally by the Appellant is not a ground to refuse defence

evidence called by the Appellant. This is a clear misdirection and denial of a

fair trial.

Further, the Learned Trial Judge had concluded that the evidence given by

PW1 and PW3 could be accepted as true regarding the raid conducted in

11 | P a g e

respect of the Appellant before considering other evidence adduced by the

prosecution and the defence. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

(Page 610 of the brief.)

The above highlighted portion of the judgment very clearly shows that the

Learned High Court Judge has been greatly influenced on the inadmissible

or prejudicial evidence led by the prosecution. Therefore, it is crystal clear

that the Appellant had not been awarded a fair trial in this case.

In C.A.Sisira alias Mahatun CA/122/2006 decided on 09/10/2014 Anil

Gooneratne,J. held that:

The prime duty of the trial judge is to weigh the evidence correctly and

decide whether the defence case is capable of creating a reasonable

doubt in the prosecution caseHowever good or bad the witness or

whether he has a bad track record should be forgotten and not the

deciding factor. Trial Judge should only concentrate on the evidence

before court.

12 | P a g e

Next, the Learned Counsel contends that the Learned Trial Judge has failed

to give due consideration on the discrepancies of the production from the

point of detection to the office of the Police Narcotic Bureau and from the

Police Narcotic Bureau to the office of the Government Analyst.

Chain of custody issues are very important in cases involving drugs. To prove

chain of custody, the prosecution must present cogent testimonial and

documentary evidence to establish that the items presented is the same item

that had been recovered from the possession of an accused person.

The defence can challenge the chain of custody evidence by questioning

whether the evidence presented at trial is the same evidence as what was

collected from an accused person. If there is any discrepancy in the chain of

custody of a production and the prosecution is unable to prove who had the

custody of production until it reached the analyst, the chain of custody

stands broken.

The Appellant takes up the position that the amount of Heroin which had

been mentioned in the indictment was not recovered from him. Further he

was not arrested as stated by PW1.He was arrested at his residence.

According to PW1, although he had testified that two parcels of Heroin were

recovered from the Appellant, in his notes he had stated that the suspected

Heroin parcels had been recovered from them. This a vital discrepancy in the

evidence given by PW1.The relevant portion is re-produced below:

According to defence witness Romy Jamaldeen, the team of police officers

first had come to his house, searched his house but nothing had been found.

Thereafter, the team had gone to a nearby abandoned house and brought

two parcels. Next, the team had gone to the Appellants house and searched

his house. As the Appellant expressed his displeasure and involved in a

verbal exchange with the police team, the Appellant was brought to Police

Narcotic Bureau thereafter.

According to PW1, after the raid he had come to the Bureau at 11.15 hours

and handed over the production pertaining to this case at 15.40 hours to

PW04 SI/Perera. The relevant portions are re-produced below:

But under further cross examination PW1 had stated that he handed over

the production to PW4 at 12.05 hours. The relevant portion is re-produced

below:

The above highlighted portions of evidence of PW1 shows the per se

contradictory position he had taken in his examination-in-chief and cross

examination.

PW4 even though admitted that he handed over the productions pertaining

to this case to court, in the cross examination admitted that he did not hand

over productions to the court. This is another per se contradiction

highlighted by the defence.

According to PW3, another person was also arrested at the time when the

Appellant was arrested. Two small packets had been recovered from the

second person and he was handed over to PW2 SI/Basnayake. The relevant

portion is re-produced below:

15 | P a g e

According to PW1, only one packet of Heroin was recovered from the second

person, and he was charged in the Magistrate Court. This is another inter se

contradiction highlighted between the evidence of PW1 and PW3.

The highlighted inter se and per se contradictions are extremely vital to

establish the production chain.

According to PW1, the team had left the bureau at 6.05 hours for the raid.

Under the cross examination the witness said that they left the bureau at

6.50 hours.

According to PW3, the team had left the bureau at 6.25 hours.

Further, although PW1 and his team had left the Bureau in the morning, the

information pertains to the Appellant was received at 7.20 hours. It is not

clear from the evidence given by PW1 why his team had left 6.05 hours

whereas the information was received only at 7.20 hours.

This contradictory and ambiguous evidence of PW1 and PW3 create serious

doubt on the probability of the prosecution version.

I consider it is very appropriate to mention what Justice Mackenna in

Discretion, The Irish Jurist, Vol.IX (new series), 1 at page10 has stated.

When I have done my best to separate the true from the false by these

more or less objective tests, I say which story seems to me the more

probable, the plaintiffs or the defendants, and If I cannot say which, I

decide the case, as the law requires me to do in the defendants favour.

In this case as stated earlier, the Learned Trial Judge had concluded that

the evidence given by PW1 and PW3 could be accepted as true regarding the

raid conducted in respect of the Appellant before considering other evidence

adduced by the prosecution and the defence. This clearly shows that the

Learned High Court Judge has been highly influenced on the inadmissible

or prejudicial evidence led by the prosecution. This is a clear violation of the

fair trial concept.

16 | P a g e

Further, leading contradictory evidence about the detection of Heroin from

the Appellant diminishes the evidentiary value of witnesses PW1 and PW3

who are the important witnesses in this case.

With the highlighted serious defects above, this case cannot march forward

with the conclusion reached by the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo.

Therefore, I set aside the conviction and the sentence dated 12/03/2015

imposed on the Appellant by the learned High Court Judge of Colombo and

acquit him from both charges.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
