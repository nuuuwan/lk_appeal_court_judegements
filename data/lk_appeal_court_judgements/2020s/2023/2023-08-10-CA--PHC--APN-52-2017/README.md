Prasantha De Silva J.,

Judgment

The Petitioner namely Gammedda Widanelage Nilantha Rohana Abeywardhana being the

informant instituted action against the Respondent in terms of Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary

Court Procedure Act No 44 of 1979, alleging that the Respondent had obstructed the Petitioners

free movement by erecting a concrete fence along the land in question, in which the Petitioner

was residing.

The learned magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge after having inquired the

dispute between the parties by way of affidavits, counter affidavits, documents and written

submissions, delivered the Order on 13.05.2015 dismissing the application of the Petitioner.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the Petitioner-Petitioner had invoked the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa Province holden at Ratnapura.

However, the learned High Court Judge too had dismissed the revision application of the

Petitioner.

Thereafter, the Petitioner-Petitioner-Petitioner [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Petitioner] had preferred an Appeal bearing no CA PHC 111/2017 and had also made an

application by way of revision CA Application No CA (PHC) APN 52/2017.

The said revision application was supported on 18.07.2017 and Court issued notice on the

Respondent-Respondent-Respondent [hereinafter referred to as the Respondent] and Court also

granted an interim order as prayed in prayer (d) of the Petition.

Subsequently, the Respondent filed a statement of objections and Petitioner had filed counter

objections. After the competition of the pleadings in the said revision application, the matter was

fixed for hearing.

It appears that the Petitioner has filed written submissions on 16.11.2018 and the Respondent

also filed written submissions on 27.11.2018. Although the matter was fixed for inquiry, it has

been postponed several times for various reasons.

When this matter was mentioned on 24.05.2022, Court refixed the matter for inquiry along

with CA PHC 111/2017 for 14.09. 2022. On this date also the matter was postponed, and it was

refixed for a hearing on 25.02.2023.

According to the journal entry dated 28.02.2023, Counsels for the Petitioner as well as the

Respondent agreed to dispose of CA (PHC) APN 52/2017 by way of written submissions and also

agreed to abide by the Order of this revision application in appeal case no. CA (PHC) 111/2017.

It is seen that the Learned Magistrate had dismissed the application of the Petitioner on the

ground that the Petitioner had instituted the action after lapse of two months period by filing

information on 05.03.2014 and hence not entitled to a remedy under section 68(3) of the

Primary Court Procedure Act.

The learned Magistrate in order dated 13.05.2015 had stated as follows,

2014.01.15

. 2

.

2014.03.05 . 2

.

It is settled law that section 68(3) of the Primary Court Procedure Act becomes applicable only

if the Judge of the Primary Court can come to a definite finding that some other Party had been

forcibly dispossessed within a period of two months immediately before the date on which the

information had been filed under section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

It appears that in the information dated 05.03.2014 filed by the Petitioner in the instant case,

has described the subject matter of the action.

It was alleged by the Petitioner that on 05.01.2014 that the Respondent had disturbed the

peaceful possession of the Petitioner by forcibly erecting concrete posts and thereby encroaching

a portion of land, where Petitioner had been in possession. The Petitioner had made a complaint

to the Pollice station Kalawana against the Respondent on the same day and had informed that

the Respondent had disturbed and interrupted the free enjoyment of the subject premises by the

Petitioner.

Page 5 of 7

It is seen that the Petitioner had filed a Police complaint for the second time on 17.02.2014

stating that the Respondents act of erecting the fence had obstructed the Petitioners entry to the

garage and entry to the main road from the garage.

The Petitioner had made another complaint on 24.02.2014 to the Police station of Kalawana,

alleging that the Respondent had initiated cleaning the strips of land and when the Petitioner

questioned about the same, the Respondent quarreled with the Petitioner and had attempted to

assault the Petitioner with a mamoty.

Pursuant to the complaint made to the Police station of Kalawana, the courts attention was drawn

to the observation notes made by PC 42816 Ranjith and the sketch drawn to describe the scene

by PC 36424 Sarath.

Which stated that,

.

,

In view of the aforementioned complaints made to the Police station Kalawana, it is evident

that Respondent had continuously disturbed the peaceful possession of the Petitioner in respect

of the disputed land. Moreover, it also clearly shows that the Respondent had encroached a

portion of the land in which the Petitioner had been in possession. Thereby, it is apparent that

the Petitioner was forcibly dispossessed from the said encroached portion of the land.

Therefore, it clearly manifest that the impugned dispute between the Parties has to be determined

in terms of section 68(3) of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

(3) Where at an inquiry into a dispute relating to the right to the possession of any land

or any part of a land the Judge of the Primary Court is satisfied that any person who had

been in possession of the land or part has been forcibly dispossessed within a period of

two months immediately before the date on which the information was filed under

section 66, he may make a determination to that effect and make an order directing that

the party dispossessed be restored to possession and prohibiting all disturbance of such

possession otherwise than under the authority of an order or decree of a competent court.

Page 6 of 7

Since the first complaint was filed on 05.01.2014 on the date on which the Respondent

encroached on the land and the information was filed on 05.03.2014, it is evident that the

information was filed exactly within a period of two months immediately before the date on

which the information was filed as stipulated in the Act.

Thus, it clearly establishes that the Petitioner was in possession of the disputed portion of land

within two months immediately prior to the date on which the information was filed under

section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

It is to be observed that the Learned Magistrate has miscalculated the period and thereby

misdirected himself and held that the information was filed by the Petitioner after the lapse of

two months period from the date of dispossession and further held that the Respondent had

possessed the land in dispute for more than a period of two months.

Therefore, it is imperative to note that the learned Magistrate had erred in law and facts and

held against the Petitioner.

It is to be noted that the Learned Provincial high Court Judge in his order dated 16.03.2017 had

state that,

.

, .

Accordingly, the learned High Court Judge had dismissed the revision application made by the

Petitioner on the basis that the learned Magistrate has come to the correct conclusion that the

Petitioner had failed to file the information within two months from the date of dispossession.

In view of the foregoing reasons, it clearly shows that the Petitioner had been in possession of

the disputed premises for the relevant period and their possession was disturbed by the

Respondent on 05.01.2014 and thereby dispossessing the Petitioner from the disputed portion

of land within two months prior to filing of the information on 05.03.2014

Thus, we set aside the order dated 16.03.2017 by the Learned Provincial High Court Judge and

the order of the Learned Magistrate dated 15.05.2016.

Hence, we allow the revision application dated 03.04.2017 of the Petitioner-Petitioner-

Petitioner. As such, in terms of Section 68(3) of the Primary Court Procedure Act, the Petitioner

Page 7 of 7

is entitled to the possession of the encroached portion of the land and the Petitioner should be

restored to the disputed premises and all disturbances of such possession otherwise than under

the authority of an order or decree of a competent court are hereby prohibited.

Since Parties agreed to abide by the order in this revision application bearing no CA PHC APN

52/2017 to CA PHC 111/2017, both matters are concluded herewith.

Revision application is allowed.
