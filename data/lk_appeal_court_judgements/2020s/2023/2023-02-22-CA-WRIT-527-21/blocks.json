Forest produce includes rocks and minerals also when found in or brought from a forest (See Section 78(d) of the Forest Conservation Ordinance). It is observed from the Preamble that the Forest Ordinance was enacted, inter alia, with the intention of conservation, protection and sustainable management of the forest resources and utilization of forest produce. Therefore, the said fee is altogether a separate levy charged for the usage of and access to conserved and protected state land. Accordingly, these different levies; namely the Royalty charged under the Mines and Minerals Act and charging a fee under Gazette Notification marked P-15B are justified against the alleged double jeopardy claimed by the Petitioners.
