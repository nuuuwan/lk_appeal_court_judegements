MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to obtain bail to the suspect namely

W Ratnapala under the provisions of the Assistance to and Protection of

Victims of Crime and Witnesses act.

A complaint had been lodged against the suspect on 25.4.2021 for

attempted murder and had been bailed out by the Magistrate on

5.5.2021 and thereafter he had threatened his wife asking her not to give

evidence in the substantive case.

Subsequently the police had filed a B report under the instant act as a

result of which the suspect had been remanded and has been in remand

ever since.

The State Counsel appearing for the respondents objected to the

application based on the threats levelled at the victim and sated that the

non-summery in the substantive matter had commenced.

In considering the law pertaining to the instant matter bail can be

considered under the instant act only upon exceptional circumstances by

the Court of Appeal and the act has not defined the term exceptional.

But in many of our decided cases it has been held that the exceptionality

depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.

In the instant case the exceptionality pleaded is that although eight

months have passed since the incarceration of the suspect the matter

pertaining to the suspect has not been concluded.

Hence as the instant act has very clearly stated that priority should be

given for matters under this act over other matters, in the instant matter

it had not been so as such this Court is of the view that it is only but fair

that the suspect in the instant matter should be enlarged on bail.

As such the instant application for bail is allowed and we direct that the

learned Magistrate to enlarge the above-mentioned suspect on suitable

conditions of bail.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
