Decided on : 27.01.2023

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

A writ of Certiorari is sought by the Petitioner to quash the quit notice dated 18.07.2019

(P13) issued under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979, as

amended, (Act) against the Petitioner in reference to the land morefully described in the

schedule (Land) to the said quit notice. For the purpose of making an order on issuance

of notice by this Court, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner as well as the learned State

Counsel who appears for the Respondents on 29.11.2022 agreed that this Application be

dealt with solely on the basis of written submissions.

The Petitioners alleged ground of challenge is that he has put up a building on the Land

and the 1st Respondent-Divisional Secretary has waited until the completion of the

construction of the said building to issue the impugned quit notice. The Petitioner pleads

that the Land is adjacent to the office of the 1st Respondent. Based on such circumstances,

the Petitioner pleads mala fides on the part of the 1st Respondent. The Petitioner states that

he and his predecessors have been in undisputed, uninterrupted possession for well over

50 years and thereby has obtained prescriptive title to the Land.

The Petitioners main contention is that the 1st Respondent taking steps to recover the

possession of the western boundary of the Land (1.4 Perches) is illegal, unlawful and

arbitrary as its merely a boundary dispute. On perusal of the journal entry dated

27.04.2021 of this case, it implies that the learned Counsel for the Petitioner had informed

this Court that he would be satisfied if a superimposition of Surveyor Generals Plan

marked P7 is carried out on Plan marked P16 (the Petitioner has sought to correct it as

P17 in his written submissions). Subsequently, after carrying out such superimposition,

Page 3 of 6

the Surveyor General has tendered to Court the tracing No. Maha/AKR/2019/126

together with a copy of the Preliminary Plan No. Maha/2449 along with the motion dated

16.12.2021. In view of the said tracing Maha/AKR/2019/126, the Surveyor General has

clarified that the Petitioner has encroached Lot Nos. 1 and 2 of Preliminary Plan

Maha/5737. The said area of encroachment is depicted as Lot No. A in the said tracing

Maha/AKR/2019/126.

In terms of Section 3(1) of the Act, if the competent authority is of the opinion;

a) that any land is a state land

b) that any person is in unauthorized possession or occupation of such land

he may take steps to evict the unauthorized occupants.

Furthermore, in terms of Section 9 of the Act, it shall not be competent for the Magistrates

Court to call for any evidence from the competent authority in support of the applications

under Section 5 of the Act. It is observed that there is plethora of judgments where the

scheme of the Act has been illustrated.

Among several other judgements1, the Court in Farook vs. Gunawardena Government Agent

Ampara (1980) 2 Sri. L.R. 243 held;

Urgency appears to be the hallmark of this Act. Under section 3, 30 days notice shall be

given. Under section 4, the person in possession is not entitled to object to notice on any ground

whatsoever except as provided for in section 9 and the person who is in possession is required

to vacate the land within the month specified by the notice. Under section 6 the Magistrate is

required to issue summons forthwith to appear and show cause on a date not later than two

weeks from the date of issue of such summons. Under section 8(2) the Magistrate is required

to give priority over all state business of that court. Under section 9, the party notice can raise

objections only on the basis of a valid permit issued by the State. Under section 10, if the

Magistrate is not satisfied, he shall make order directing ejectment forthwith and no appeal

1Ihalapathirana vs. Bulankulame, Director-General, U.D.A. (1988) 1 Sri. L.R. 416; Gunaratne (Alexis Auction Rooms) vs. Abeysinghe (Urban Development Authority) (1988) 1 Sri. L.R. 255; Nirmal Paper Converters (Pvt) Ltd. vs. Sri Lanka Port Authority and another (1993) 1 Sri. L.R. 219; Aravindakumar vs. Alwis and others (2007) 1 Sri. L.R. 316; Wedamulla vs. Abeysinghe 1999 3 Sri. L.R. 26; Muhandiram vs. Chairman No. 111, Janatha Estate Development Board (1992) 1 Sri. L.R. 110

shall lie against the order of ejectment. Under section 17, the provisions of this Act have effect

notwithstanding anything contained in any written law.

When the Legislature has made express provision for any person who is aggrieved that he

has been wrongfully ejected from any land to obtain relief by a process described in the Act

itself, it is not for this Court to grant relief on the ground that the petitioner has not been

heard. Where the structure of the entire Act is to preclude investigations and inquires and

where is it expressly provided (a) the only defence that can be put forward at any stage of the

proceedings under this Act can be based only upon a valid permit or written authority of the

State and (b) special provisions have been made for aggrieved parties to obtain relief, I am of

the opinion that the Act expressly precludes the need for an inquiry by the competent authority

before he forms the opinion that any land is State land.

In Don Sarath Rajapaksha vs. Susantha Aththanayake, Divisional Secretary and another,

CA/WRIT/374/2022 decided on 29.11.2022, I have referred to the following passage of

His Lordship Justice Arjuna Obeyesekera in Udagedara Waththe Anusha Kumari

Nikaathagoda vs. Jayasinghe Mudiyanselage Chamila Indika Jayasinghe, Divisional Secretary

and others, CA/Writ/293/2017 decided on 18.11.2019;

The strict regime for the expeditious recovery of State land stipulated in the Act only provides

a person served with a quit notice, the limited remedies under Section 9, and a person against

whom an Order of ejectment has been issued, an opportunity to vindicate her title under

Section 12 of the Act. It is the view of this Court that the legislature could not have intended

for the Competent Authority's opinion, which can have far reaching consequences on one' s

proprietary rights, to be baseless. The Competent Authority's opinion must thus be formed on

a rational basis. What constitutes a rational basis must be ascertained case by case. In the

present application, this Court is of the view that a Surveyor General's Plan confirming that

the land acquisition process had been completed, would amply satisfy the test for

rationality.2

2 See Section 83 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows: 'The court shall presume that maps, plans, or surveys purporting to be signed by the Surveyor General or officer acting on his behalf were duly made by his authority and are accurate; but maps, plans, or surveys not so signed must be proved to be accurate.'; Section 21 of the Survey Act No. 17 of 2002 provides as follows: "Any cadastral map, plan, or any other plan or map prepared in accordance with the provisions of this Act or any written law, purported to be signed by the Surveyor General or officer acting on his behalf and offered in evidence in any suit shall be received

Page 5 of 6

This Court wishes to emphasise, for the avoidance of any doubt that the Competent

Authority is not required in terms of the Act to carry out an inquiry of the title of the person

who is in unauthorized possession of such land.

The principle then is that while no inquiry is needed to form an opinion, there should

be a rational basis to form the opinion that the State is lawfully entitled to the land. The

rational basis should satisfy the Wednesbury test of reasonableness. Thus, a Competent

Authority would be acting reasonably if he were acting on the basis of a Surveyor General's

plan, even if the occupant is claiming prescription. The Competent Authority is not expected

to, and indeed is precluded from, carrying out an inquiry. (Emphasis added)

In the said judgement the Court analyzing the precedent laid down in related judgements

has taken an advanced approach in respect of the applications made under State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979.

In the instant Application, the Surveyor General has not reported any evidence

contradicting the quit notice or supporting the Petitioners alleged claim that the Land is

private land. Even the Petitioner has not tendered any evidence to Court in order to

establish that the subject land is not a State Land apart from his assertions on prescriptive

title. In terms of Section 21 of the Survey Act No. 17 of 2002, any plan prepared according

to law, inter alia, purported to be signed by the Surveyor General and shall be taken to be

prima facie proof of the facts stated therein until evidence to the contrary shall have first

been given.

The Petitioners purported grounds of review in the instant Application cannot be assumed

as sufficient material to collaborate the independent evidence together with the Surveyor

Generals plan which are tendered to Court by the 1st Respondent. Hence, I see no reason

to arrive at a conclusion that the 1st Respondents opinion that the subject Land is a State

Land is unreasonable and irrational. It is observed that the Petitioner anyway has the

opportunity to institute an action against the State, under Section 12 of the Act for the

vindication of his purported title, within 6 months from the date of the order of ejectment

by a Magistrates Court.

in evidence, and shall be taken to be prima facie proof of the facts stated therein." Similar provision was found in Section 6 of the Land Surveys Ordinance, which has since been repealed by the Survey Act.

This Court has constantly taken the view that in an application for judicial review, the

stage of notice demands that the Court should consider whether the case is suitable for full

investigation at a hearing at which all parties have been given notice. Thus, I hold that the

test for prima facie case has not been fulfilled by the Petitioner of the instant Application

and accordingly, the Application for formal notice on the Respondents is refused.

Application is dismissed.
