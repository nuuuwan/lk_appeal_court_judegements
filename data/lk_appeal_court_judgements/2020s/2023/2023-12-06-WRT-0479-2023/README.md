Page 5 of 10

Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979 (as amended) against the

Petitioner ;

j. WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO PRAYERS d to I issue a mandate in the nature of a WRIT

OF PROHIBITION prohibiting the 7th Respondent ( as representing and binding the

Minster of Defense, under and in terms of the proviso to Article 35 (3) of the

Constitution), and /or the Minister of Defense himself (if deemed necessary by Court),

and/or any one or more of the other Respondents, and/or their servants and/or

agents, and/or successors, from moving and/or changing the current place of

detention of the Petitioner, without first notifying the 9th Respondent AND Court;

As far as the circumstances of this case are concerned the Detention Order dated

15/03/2023 is said to have been extended on 13th June 2023 and as it stands now said

Detention Order has finally been extended on the 10th September 2023 which would be in

effect till the 9th December 2023. Therefore, the final Detention Order issued on the 10th of

September would also expire on the 09th of December just three days from delivering this

judgment. Though the initial Detention Order has been extended, each extension had to be

considered as a fresh Detention Order which would be effective for a maximum period of

three months. Accordingly, the Detention Orders dated 15th March 2023, and 13th June

2023, have already expired, and the order presently in force will expire in three days. Hence,

questioning the legality of such would merely be of academic interest. I have no intention of

engaging in such an academic excursion at this juncture. Further, it should be borne in mind

that this is an application for writ and our duty is to look into the validity of the impugned

Detention Orders. Therefore, we will be limiting our consideration only to the issuance of a

new detention order/extension of the previous Detention Order, on or before 09/12/2023.

It is strongly contended by the petitioner that he has no involvement in terrorist activities

hence, he could not be held on Detention orders issued under Section 9(1) of the Prevention

of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act (No. 48 of 1979) (hereinafter mentioned as the

PTA). The basis of such being the provisions of the PTA (Section 09) would only be

applicable to the offences coming under the said PTA. While appreciating and accepting this

argument I will be analyzing it in due course.

Page 6 of 10

In understanding this, it is paramount to explore the provisions of the PTA to understand

the offences coming under the said Act. As per section 02 of the PTA;

2. (1) Any person who-

(a) causes the death of any specified person, or kidnaps or abducts a specified

person, or commits any other attack upon any such person, which act would, under

the provisions of the Penal Code, be punishable with death or a term of imprisonment

of not less than seven years; or

(b) causes the death of any person who is a witness to any offence under this Act, or

kidnaps or abducts or commits any other attack upon any such person, which act

would, under the provisions of the Penal Code, be punishable with death or a term of

imprisonment of not less than seven years; or

(c) commits criminal intimidation of any specified person or a witness referred to in

paragraph (b); or

(d) commits the offence of robbery of the property of the Government, any

department, statutory board, public corporation, bank, co-operative union or co-

operative society; or

(e) commits the offence of mischief to the property of the Government, any

department, statutory board, public corporation, bank, co-operative union or co-

operative society or to any other public property; or

(f) without lawful authority imports, manufactures or collects any firearms, offensive

weapons, ammunition or explosives or any article or thing used, or intended to be

used, in the manufacture of explosives; or

(g) possesses without lawful authority, within any security area, any firearms or any

offensive weapon, ammunition or explosives or any article or thing used, or intended

to be used, in the manufacture of explosives; or

(h) by words either spoken or intended to be read or by signs or by visible

representations or otherwise causes or intends to cause commission of acts of

Page 7 of 10

violence or religious, racial or communal disharmony or feelings of ill-will or hostility

between different communities or racial or religious groups; or

(i) without lawful authority erases, mutilates, defaces or otherwise interferes with

any words, inscriptions, or lettering appearing on any board or other fixture on, upon

or adjacent to, any highway, street, road or any other public place; or

(j) harbours, conceals or in any other manner prevents, hinders or interferes with the

apprehension of, a proclaimed person or any other person, knowing or having reason

to believe that such person has committed an offence under this Act,

In this case, one of the main contentions of the Petitioner is that the respondents have

failed/neglected to place sufficient material before the Minister of Defense for the

issuance/extension of the impugned Detention Orders. It is noted that the Petitioner with

his petition has submitted the proceedings of the Magistrates Courts which contains the

copies of the B reports filed therein. It contains P1 the first Detention Order issued, which I

reproduce below.

On perusal of P14 dated 13th of June 2023 and P17 dated 10th September, the extensions

of P1 it is clear that no additional material/charges/allegations were leveled against the

Petitioner by them. Furthermore, the Respondents do not submit any material, which the

Petitioner has failed to submit in substantiating their claim.

When this matter was supported on 15th September 2023 the Court issued notice on the

Respondents and an interim Order as per prayer q of the Petition. Thereafter at the

Argument parties made submissions and counter submissions. We have duly considered

the said submissions. The Respondents raised several preliminary objections, one being

that the institution of the two fundamental rights applications by the Petitioner in the

Supreme Court bearing No. SCFR/165/2023, and SCFR/107/2023. In those two applications

though prayed for the same relief, they were based on different grounds hence, the writ

jurisdiction of this Court is not affected and the adjudication of this matter would have no

bearing upon the outcome of those two matters pending before the Supreme Court.

Now I will analyze the relevant law applicable to the issue.

Section 09 of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act (No. 48 of 1979) sets

out that;

9. (1) Where the Minister has reason to believe or suspect that any person is

connected with or concerned in any unlawful activity, the Minister may order that

such person be detained for a period not exceeding three months in the first instance,

Page 9 of 10

in such place and subject to such conditions as may be determined by the Minister

and any such order may be extended from time to time for a period not exceeding

three months at a time.

As correctly submitted by the Petitioner our Courts have subjected these sections to intense

judicial certainty. In Weerawansa vs. The Attorney General and others(2000) 1 SLR 387 his

Lordship Justice Fernando has held, Amarasinghe J. and Dheeraratne J. conquering that( at

page 401);

an arrested person must be produced before a Magistrate, before the period of

seventy-two hours allowed by section 7(1) comes to an end unless a detention order

has been made under section 9(1), such an order can only be made if the minister

has reason to believe or suspect that [such] person is connected with or concerned in

any unlawful activity. Not only must the Minister of Defence, subjectively, have the

required belief or suspicion, but there must also be, objectively, reason for such

belief. While Article 13(2) permits detention only upon a judicial order, section 9(1)

allows a Ministerial order. However, being an order, which results in a deprivation of

liberty, it must be made with no less care and consideration.

The Ministers order does not depend on the validity of the preceding arrest and

detention. Even if such arrest and detention were invalid, nevertheless at the time the

detention order was made the Minister did have reason to believe or suspect that the

detainee was connected with or concerned in any unlawful activity the detention

order and subsequently detention would be lawful.

The question before us is whether any of the offences disclosed/alleged by P1 reproduced

above come within the definition of Section 02 of the PTA which is also reproduced above.

In my opinion P1 does not contain any such allegation/offence as the respondents do not

contend that the Magistrate of Mount-Lavinia is a specified person or that the Magistrates

Court of Mount-Lavinia is a security area, specified by a gazette issued under the provisions

of the PTA. In any event such material was not submitted before us.

Page 10 of 10

As stated before since I do not intend to venture into the validity of previous Detention

Orders namely dated 15th March 2023, 13th June 2023 and 10th September 2023, and the

following directions are made.

If the Respondents 1-6 and 8 intend to obtain a fresh Detention Order or an extension of the

existing Detention Orders in respect of this Petitioner, they should submit appropriate and

sufficient material before the Minister of Defense.

In absence of such appropriate and sufficient material being produced before the Minister

of Defense, the 1st-6th and 8th Respondents should produce the Petitioner before a

Magistrate who has jurisdiction, forthwith.

However, it should be borne in mind that this will not preclude the Minister of Defense from

issuing a fresh Detention Order on being satisfied of the material presented before him.

Subject to the said directions this writ application is dismissed without cost.
