Accused-Appellants are not challenging the conviction. They are contesting only the

sentence. All counsel made their submissions regarding the excessive sentence imposed

against the accused-appellants in regard to the 3rd count of the indictment. They request

from this Court to re-consider the sentence imposed on the 3rd count and to reduce the

sentence enabling them to go back to the society and to join their family members.

Learned Counsel for the Appellants says that they are not having any previous convictions.

They promise this Court that they will not involve in any criminal activities again in the

future.

Further the learned Counsel on behalf of all the accused-appellants informs court that the

sentence be back dated as they were in custody since 25.10.2019.

Considering the circumstances, of the case and the submissions made by the learned

Counsel on behalf of the accused-appellants, we decide to reduce the sentence for the 3rd

count as it is excessive.

We now impose 5 years Rigorous Imprisonment for the 3rd count for all the accused-

appellants.

The sentence for the 1st and 2nd counts will remain the same.

Fine which was imposed for all 3 counts will also not be changed. Default terms also will

remain the same.

The new sentences are as follows;

1. For the 1st count 5 months Rigorous Imprisonment and Rs.2,000/- fine, in default 2

months simple imprisonment.

2. For the 2nd count 5 years Rigorous Imprisonment and Rs.5,000/- fine, in default 5

months simple imprisonment.

3. For the 3rd count 5 years Rigorous Imprisonment and Rs.10,000/- fine, in default 10

months simple imprisonment.

All sentences should run concurrently with effect from 25.10.2019.
