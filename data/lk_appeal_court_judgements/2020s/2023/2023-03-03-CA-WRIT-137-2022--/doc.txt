Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner filing this Application on 01.04.2022 seeks for a writ of Mandamus

directing the 1st Respondent to hand over the elephant calf named Miyan Kumar to the

Safari Park at Ridiyagama or to any other appropriate place. A writ of Prohibition is also

sought to prevent the 1st Respondent from issuing licenses enabling the 4th Respondent to

possess elephants. In addition to above, the Petitioner is challenging the Gazette

Extraordinary Notification No. 2241/41 dated 19.08.2021.

The 4th Respondent filed limited Statement of Objections on 01.12.2022 along with an

affidavit.

On 02.02.2023, the Petitioner made submissions in support of this Application. The

learned Additional Solicitor General for the 1st to 3rd, 5th & 6th Respondents and the learned

Counsel for the 4th Respondent made submissions on the same day opposing this

Application. The Respondents move that this Application be dismissed in limine as the

Petitioner, in the instant Application, is relying on the same set of documents which were

annexed to the application bearing No. CA/Writ/77/2021 and the said application

CA/Writ/77/2021 has been withdrawn by the Petitioner. After such submissions, this

Court reserved the order on issuance of notice until 03.03.2023.

The Petitioner filed a motion on 21.02.2023 attempting to tender two new documents,

marked as X20 and X21. In terms of Rule 3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal Rules, the

Petition in respect of applications made to the Court of Appeal (for the exercise of the

powers vested in the Court of Appeal by Article 140 or Article 141 of the Constitution)

should be accompanied by the original documents material to such application in the form

of exhibits. Where a petitioner is unable to tender such documents, he shall state the reason

for such inability and seek leave of the court to furnish such documents later. As per the

said Rule, where a petitioner fails to comply with such provisions of the said Rule, the

court may, ex mero motu or at the instance of any party, dismiss such application.

However, the privilege given to a petitioner to furnish documents after filing the petition

should not be abused by introducing new documents when the Court has already reserved

the order, after hearing submissions, unless there are any exceptional grounds. There is no

application up to date to amend the Petition (together with the affidavit) or to file a limited

Counter Affidavit in reference to the averments in the limited Statement of Objections filed

on behalf of the 4th Respondent. Tendering documents at a stage where the Court has

reserved its order to be delivered on a future date would certainly cause prejudice to the

other parties of the case. Unless there is consent of all parties, the documents should be

tendered following due process and/or according to the Rules of this Court.

In light of the above, I reject the application for tendering documents by way of the said

motion dated 21.02.2023. However, this order should not impede the Petitioner from

Page 4 of 4

furnishing documents in compliance with the Rules of the Court of Appeal at an

appropriate stage of this case.

The Court observes that the said Gazette Extraordinary Notification No. 2241/41 dated

19.08.2021 is being challenged in another application by different parties before this Court.

Based only on such ground, the Court is inclined to issue formal notice on the

Respondents. Anyhow, considering the tests applicable to granting of interim relief, I

proceed to refuse the application for interim relief as the facts and the circumstances in

relation to the relief prayed for in paragraph () of the prayer of the Petition do not

warrant this Court to grant such interim relief at this stage.

For fuller and proper adjudication of this matter, we are of the view that the 1st Respondent

or any of his representatives should visit the place where the Elephant Miyan Kumar is

kept and submit a report to Court with regard to the prevailing state of the well-being of

the Elephant. The 1st Respondent when reporting to Court can get the assistance of a

suitable veterinary surgeon of a Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences affiliated to a

local university or a government institution to confirm the prevailing health condition of

the Elephant. Thus, the 1st Respondent is directed to submit a report as mentioned above

through the Attorney General within five weeks from today and the 4th Respondent is

directed to make all necessary arrangements to facilitate the 1st Respondent to comprise

the such Report.

The Registrar is directed to communicate this order to the 1st Respondent.

I agree.
