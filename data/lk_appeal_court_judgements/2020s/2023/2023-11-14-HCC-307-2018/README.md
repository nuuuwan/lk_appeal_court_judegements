Section 19(c) of the Bribery Act as amended.

iii. On or about 05th February 2010 in the course of the transaction referred to in

Charge 1 at Meegahakiwula within the jurisdiction of this Court you are being a

Gamini Wickramaratna through Sedillage Don Karunadasa Wickramaratna as an

Page 4 of 12

Wickramaratnaand thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 19(c)

of the Bribery Act.

Prosecution led the evidence of eight witnesses, marking productions P1 to P10.

The Accused gave evidence and subjected himself to cross-examination. One defense

witness was called, and the defence closed the case marking productions V1 to V11.

After the trial, the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo Acquitted the Accused

from the 1st and the 3rd Count but convicted the Accused on both the 2nd and the 4th Counts

and sentenced to,

a. 3 years of rigorous imprisonment on both counts, the sentence to run

concurrently.

b. To a fine of Rs.5000 for each count in default One-year rigorous

imprisonment.

c. In addition, a penalty of Rs.20,000 in terms of section 26 of the Bribery Act.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Accused preferred an

appeal to this Court.

The following grounds were urged by the learned counsel for the defence in his

written submission.

a. Has the prosecution proved the case against the Accused appellant beyond

reasonable doubt?

b. Does the evidence clearly demonstrate that the Complainant was acting with

animosity towards the Accused Appellant because he performed his official duties

in accordance with the law?

c. Has the Learned Trial Judge failed to take into consideration matters favourable

to the Accused Appellant and thereby have the Accused Appellants been deprived

of a fair trial?

Page 5 of 12

d. The Learned High Court Judge has not considered the defence evidence in

accordance with the guidelines set out by Your Lordships Court.

e. The Learned High Court Judge has drawn adverse inferences from the defence

evidence/ defence documents which were not borne out in the High Court Trial and

thereby there has been a denial of a trial?

f. Even assuming without conceding that a loan was requested it does not amount to

a gratification within the meaning of the law and the circumstances of this case.

Has the failure of the Learned High Court Judge to consider this aspect occasioned

a miscarriage of justice?

The facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that:

In his evidence, retired police officer Gamini Wickramarathna aimed to secure a

water pipeline for his banana plantation. To obtain the necessary permissions, he

approached Palliyaguruge Susantha, the Agrarian Development Officer of the

Rideemaliyedda area. Mr. Susantha introduced him to the Accused, who held the position

of Agrarian Research Development Officer in the Pinnagolla area at the time. The Accused

was suggested as the person to provide a report for this purpose.

Subsequently, Mr. Susantha advised the complainant to prepare a project report.

Following this, Mr. Susantha requested Rs. 25,000, explaining that it was necessary for

superior officers to visit the site and approve the project report.

It is alleged that after receiving the project report on February 2, 2010, the

Accused visited the site, contacted the complainant, and requested a loan of Rs. 20,000,

promising to repay it within a week. Due to a lack of funds, the complainant borrowed

money from Athnayaka Mudiyanselage Somaratna and Karunadasa Wickramaratna.

According to the allegations, the Accused was unable to repay the loan as per the

agreement, leading Wickramaratna to file a complaint against the complainant for failing

to return Rs. 20,000 on April 30, 2010, at the Mahiyanganaya police station.

The complainant asserts that despite his repeated requests, the Accused never

returned the money. Additionally, it is claimed that the Accused refused to grant

Page 6 of 12

permission for the water supply required for cultivation, citing various reasons.

Consequently, on May 7, 2010, the Complainant filed a complaint against the Accused

Appellant at the Mahiyanganaya Police Station.

On July 22, 2011, more than a year and a half after the Accused allegedly received

Rs. 20,000, the complainant lodged a complaint with the Bribery Commission, leading to

the opening of an inquiry based on this complaint.

The central issue in question pertains to whether mere acceptance of gratification

in the absence of any evidence to demonstrate that the said gratification was accepted

as a result of or pursuant to some ulterior reason such bribery or corruption would suffice

to penalize the Accused under of Section 19(c) of the Bribery Act.

In the Bribery Act, Section 19 ( c ) read as follows.

A person;

c. who being a public servant solicits or accepts any gratification,

shall be guilty of an offence punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term of not

more than seven years and a fine not exceeding five thousand rupees.

Provided however, that it shall not be an offence for a public servant to solicit or accept

any gratification which he is authorized by law or the terms of his employment to

receive.

According to Section 90 of the Bribery Act, gratification encompasses the following:

Gratification includes,

a. Money or any gift, loan, fee, reward, commission, valuable security or other

property or interest in property of any description, whether movable or

immovable.

b. Any office, employment or contract

c. Any payment, release, discharge or liquidation of any loan, obligation or other

liability whatsoever, whether in whole or in part,

d. Any other service, favour or advantage of any description whatsoever including

protection from any penalty or disability incurred or apprehended or from any

action or proceedings of a disciplinary or penal nature, whether or not already

Page 7 of 12

instituted, and including the exercise or the forbearance from the exercise of any

right or any official power or duty, and

e. Any offer, undertaking or promise of any gratification, within the meaning of

the preceding paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d)

According to the learned High Court judge, the prosecution need not to prove that

the loan (gratification) was sought specifically for fulfilling official duties. Instead, the

judge emphasized that merely presenting evidence of the acceptance of gratification by

the government servant is sufficient to substantiate the charge.

The following excerpt of the judgment of the learned High Court Judge (at p502 ) depicts the same:

19 ()

.

.. 01

. 19 ( ) 2 4

.

It should be noted that the Accused was acquitted of the 1st and 3rd counts because

there was insufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the money

taken as a loan could be classified as gratification.

This is made clear in the following excerpt from the Judgement of the Learned High

Court Judge in his Judgement at Page 203;

.

..

Therefore, the Accused was acquitted of the 1st Count because there was no

evidence to demonstrate that the money taken as a loan could be directly construed as an

inducement for gratification.

Page 8 of 12

In this case, the Learned Trial Judge acquitted the Accused on the 1st and 3rd

counts due to the absence of Prosecution evidence establishing that the money demanded

by the Accused constituted solicitation or gratification for obtaining the report.

According to The Learned high Court judge in his judgement On the Page 501 of

the Appeal brief;

19 ()

,

.

The issue at hand is whether the Learned High Court Judge could convict the

Accused under Section 19(c) of the Bribery Act without evidence that the loan was given

by the complainant as an inducement for the Accused to perform any official work.

Section 19(c) of the Bribery Act states that any public servant who accepts any

gratification is guilty of an offence. In this case, the Accused obtained a loan from PW01,

and he was convicted. The Learned High Court Judge determined that the Accused was

a government servant who received a loan from PW01. Based on this finding, the Accused

was convicted of the charge.

According to learned judge On the Page 515 of the Appeal brief

2010 02 ,

2010.02.05 . 02 ,

. 02 04

.

Section 19(c) of the Bribery Act places the burden on the Prosecution to establish

two key elements beyond reasonable doubt: firstly, that the Accused-appellant was a

state officer, and secondly, that he accepted gratification. Furthermore, this gratification

should serve as an inducement or reward for the performance of any official act. The

term "inducement" is explicitly mentioned in the section.

Page 9 of 12

In the absence of evidence demonstrating that the particular loan was obtained

as a bribe or for corruption, or for any other such ulterior reasons it is my considered

opinion that the Learned High Court judge may have overlooked the essential element

of this offense under Section 19(c) of the Bribery Act.

A similar view was expressed by His Lordship Justice T.S. Fernando in In

Karunaratne v. The Queen, 69 NLR 10 at page 19,

In respect of the second charge of which the appellant has been convicted, Mr.

Chitty complains, again not without justification, that it would appear that the trial Judge

has once again misapprehended a question of law, this time the nature of the offence

charged. The second charge is referred to by the learned Judge as " a straight-forward

charge that the Accused being a public servant did solicit from Piyasena a gratification of

Rs. 100". He goes on to say, " this solicitation is itself an offence ". If by this he meant that

all that the prosecution had to prove was that the public servant did solicit a gratification,

I fear that one element of the offence under section 19 (c) has been overlooked.

"Gratification" has been the subject of definition in the Act (vide . section 90), but

throughout carries with it here a sinister and not an innocent connotation. If the words "

any gratification which he is not authorised by law or the terms of his employment to

receive " are given the widest possible interpretation of which they are capable, then a

public servant who accepts a personal gift from a friend, relative or neighbour, or for that

matter a birthday present from his wife, would be guilty of an offence under the Act. It

would be absurd to have to reduced oneself to the position that such gifts are within the

mischiefs which the Act was designed to punish. Some limitation upon the wide words of

the section was obviously intended by the Legislature. However wide the words of a

statute may appear to be, they must be given an interpretation that accords with the

intention of the Legislature. This rule of interpretation is formulated in Maxwell, ibid, at

pp. 58-59 as follows :-

"It is in the interpretation of general words and phrases that the principle of strictly

adapting the meaning to the particular subject-matter with reference to which the words

are used finds its most frequent application. However wide in the abstract, they are more

or less elastic, and admit of restriction or expansion to suit the subject-matter. While

expressing truly enough all that the legislature intended, they frequently express more in

their literal meaning and natural force ; and it is necessary to give them the meaning

which best suits the scope and object of the Statute without extending to ground foreign

Page 10 of 12

to the intention. It is, therefore, a canon of interpretation that all words, if they be general

and not express and precise, are to be restricted to the fitness of the matter."

This portion of Section 19(c) of the Bribery Act clearly indicates that it aims to

penalize the solicitation or acceptance of gratification other than legal gratification. It

implies that there may be situations where legal gratification is acceptable, but the

offense occurs when there is a solicitation or acceptance of gratification that goes beyond

what is legally acceptable. In such cases, the person involved must be acting as a public

servant.

The underlying problem that this part of the section seeks to address is the act of

soliciting or accepting gratification while acting as a public servant. In other words, it

pertains to situations where a public servant is carrying out their duties in their capacity

as a public servant.

This proposition was followed by His Lordship Vythialingam, in R. J. B .Fernando

v. Republic of Sri Lanka 79 I NLR page 545 in page 548, ,

Mr. Gunasekera who appeared for the Accused-appellant submitted that the

Bribery Act does not define the term gratification. The defining section merely states that

the forms which a gratification could take as including the forms set out in the section.

Mr. Gunasekera submitted that having regard to the preamble to the Act and the

definition of the terms, the word gratification when used in the Act means no more nor

less than a bribe, and as such, there must be some element of perversion and/or corruption

in the conduct. He argued that there must be some element of moral turpitude and that

an acceptance of a mere irregular payment would not come within the meaning of the

term gratification as used in the Act. He submitted that if the term gratification was given

a wide meaning so as to include any gratification then a public servant who accepted an

innocent gift would be guilty of bribery.

A similar argument was advanced before the Supreme Court in the case of

Karunaratne v. The Queen, 69 N.L.R 10. In a charge under section 19 (c) as it originally

stood the trial Judge had said that the charge " was a straightforward charge that the

Accused being a public servant did solicit from Piyasena a gratification of Rs. 100 " and

that " this solicitation is itself an offence.

. Further, he held that

Page 11 of 12

I am of the view that this same limitation should be applied to the term

gratification in sections 19 and 21 as well. Otherwise, it would be illogical. To come within

the meaning of the term gratification in the section it should be other than a legal

gratification. Was then the gratification in the instant case a gratification " other than a

legal gratification ? " Omitting words which are not relevant for the purpose, section 19

(b) read with sub-section (a) sets out that a public servant who solicits or accepts any

gratification as an inducement or a reward for his assisting any person in the transaction

of any business with the government shall be guilty of an offence..

Justice Abeyesundere, in H. J. Gregory Perera v. The Queen, 69 NLR 431 at page

432 held that,

There must also be some evidence to show that the appellant is not authorised by

law to solicit or accept a gratification of the kind referred to above.

Crown Counsel who appears for the Attorney-General submits that the Court can

take judicial notice of any law. In establishing a charge under Section 19 (c) of the Bribery

Act what the prosecution has to prove is, inter alia, that there is no law authorising the

Accused to solicit or accept the gratification mentioned in the charge. It is not possible for

any Court to take judicial notice of the absence of such a law. We are satisfied that the

prosecution has failed to lead evidence necessary to establish one ingredient of the offence

alleged in the indictment. Therefore, we set aside the conviction of the appellant and the

sentence passed on him and acquit him.

In light of the aforementioned judgment, it becomes evident that the Learned High

Court Judge, in his ruling, acknowledged the absence of evidence regarding inducement

to obtain the report. Despite this, he proceeded to convict the Accused for the 2nd and the

4th Counts.

Upon careful consideration, we are convinced that the Prosecution did not present the

requisite evidence to establish one crucial element of the alleged offense as stated in the

indictment.

Page 12 of 12

Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, guided by the wisdom of our superior

courts, we set aside the conviction and sentence and acquit the Accused.
