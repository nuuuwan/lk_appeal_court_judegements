The 2nd Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd Accused) and the 4th

Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 4th Accused) along with six other

Accused were indicted before the High Court of Kaluthara for the following counts,

1. On or about 11 March 1998 at Iddagoda, the Accused committed an offence in

terms of section140 of the Penal code by being members of an unlawful assembly

with the common object of causing injuries to Thudugalage Don Chandrasena and

Thundugalage Don Nishani Shashikala.

Page 3 of 13

2. In the course of the same transaction, the Accused committed an offence in terms

of section 146 read with section 296 of the Penal Code by committing the offence

of murder of Thudugalage Don Chandrasena.

3. In the course of the same transaction, the Accused committed an offence in terms

of section 146 read with section 296 of the Penal Code by committing the offence

of murder Thudugalage Don Nishani Shashikala.

4. In the course of the same transaction, the Accused committed an offence in terms

of section 296 read with section 32 of the Penal code by committing the offence of

Murder Thudugalage Don Chandrasena

5. In the course of the same transaction, the Accused committed an offence in terms

of section 296 read with section 32 of the Penal Code by committing the offence of

Murder Thundugalage Don Nishani Shashikala.

When the indictment was served on 09.06.2006 except for the 3rd Accused all the

Accused were present. The 3rd accused had been tried in his absentia. Before the trial

commenced since the 1st Accused was dead, steps were taken to amend the indictment.

The Prosecution led evidence of two lay witnesses and seven official witnesses and

marked documents and productions P1 to P8. After the conclusion of the Prosecution case,

the 4th Accused remained silent while the 2nd,5th,6th,7th, and 8th Accused made dock

statements.

After the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge delivered the

judgment on 10.06.2020 and found the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Accused guilty of the 4th and 5th

Count in the indictment and was imposed death sentence and acquitted on 1st,2nd, and 3rd

count. Further, he acquitted the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Accused from all counts.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction the 2nd and 4th Accused have appealed to

this court.

The following are the grounds for Appeal,

1. The Learned High Court Judge had erroneously arrived at a conclusion that both

Accused Appellants had participated in the crime with the 1st Accused and 3rd

Accused in the indictment with a common murderous intention.

Page 4 of 13

2. The Learned High Court Judge had rejected the dock statement of the 2nd

Accused Appellant on unreasonable grounds.

Following are the facts and circumstances of this case;

PW01 Duwage Piyaseeli Hemalatha, is an eyewitness to this incident. PW01 who

is the wife of the deceased Thudugalage Don Chandrasena (1st deceased) and mother of

Thundugalage Don Nishani Shashikala (2nd Deceased).

According to PW01, her husband the first deceased has 9 brothers. Two of the

brothers; Piyasena (5th Accused), Amarasena and the deceased were living with their

family in the same undivided land of Acres. PW01 family lived in a small house. There

was no electricity to the said house hence they used to light 3 oil lamps at night.

PW01 states that there has been a long-standing animosity between the deceased

and his brothers about the land they were residing, before this incident about 20-25 days

earlier Amarasena had thrown acid at the said deceased and was under medication for

11-15 days.

As per the witness, Amarasena had two sons and a daughter. Lasantha Niroshan

1st Accused is the eldest of the three. Piyasena (5th Accused) was married to Leelawathie

(6th Accused) and had three sons namely Lakshman Priyankara (2nd Accused), Ajith (3rd

Accused), and Baby Hamu.

On 11.03.1998 the day of the said incident, the PW01 was preparing dinner while

her husband( the 1st deceased) was in the living room and their daughter playing near the

front door. Around 7:30 pm 1st and the 3rd Accused arrived at their house requested rice

for dinner. At this hour the three oil lamps were lit inside the house. Despite this being

an unusual behavior, with the permission of her husband (1st deceased), Pw01 had served

rice to both the 1st and 3rd Accused. Thereafter they took the plate to a rock near the

kitchen and called out for Somasiri (the 4th Accused). The 3rd Accused had brought a

Kassippu in a can with him and had forcefully taken a glass from PW01 to drink it.

The 1st Accused after eating rice, called her husband to come out to convey a

message. When the deceased came out there, the 1st Accused had taken a sword from his

backside and attacked the deceased. While the 1st Accused was attacking the 3rd Accused

had shouted saying Kapann Kapann. PW01 states that due to the stabbing, the

deceased head fell off to the ground.

Page 5 of 13

In the meantime, the 4th Accused came from the back door to attack her. When

she tried to escape through the front door 2nd Accused blocked her from going out.

Thereafter she somehow managed to flee from the back door and hid herself beside a

shrub near her house until the police came.

Then the 5th,6th,7th, and 8th Accused whom PW01 has recognized from their voices

have come in search of the PW01 uttering the word that if they leave her alive, they would

have to face a trial hence she should be cut into 100 pieces.

When we consider this evidence, we observe that there are no major contradictions

marked by the defense. Also, we noticed she was consistent and learned High Court Judge

had correctly considered her evidence as truthful evidence. There is no reason for us to

disbelieve her evidence.

According to the JMO (PW08), he has observed 3 stab injuries that are deep in the

body which could cause instant death. He has also done the post-mortem of the 2nd

deceased who also received the cut injuries.

When we consider the evidence placed before the high court judge there is

sufficient evidence to establish that the 1st and 3rd Accused are guilty of the murder of

the 1st deceased namely, Thudugalage Don Chandrasena. About the murder of the 2nd

deceased, there is no iota of evidence placed before the high court judge to prove the

murder. But the learned high court judge has convicted the 1st -4th Accused for the 5th

count. We hold that said conviction could not stand.

The question before us is whether the 2nd and 4th Accused had a common intention

to commit the offence of murder with the 1st and 3rd Accused.

There is only one eyewitness available in this case namely Duwage Piyaseeli

Hemalatha (PW01).

According to her, the 1st and 3rd Accused came together and the 1st Accused stabbed

the deceased while the 3rd Accused said Kapapan kapapan. According to PW01 2nd and

4th Accused were not present at the time of the stabbing. According to her, they have come

later to attack her. Therefore, they were not present at the time of the incident. There is

no evidence to establish that they shared a common intention with the 1st and the 3rd

Accused to murder the Thudugalage Don Chandrasena.

According to her evidence

section 32 of the Penal Code read as follows.

When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common

intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were

done by him alone.

Section 294 of the Penal Code states that except in the cases hereinafter

excepted, culpable homicide is murder..Thirdly - If it is done with the intention of

causing bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is

sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.

I would like to quote the words uttered by Alles J in The Richards case reported

in 1956,AC 576

If two persons took part in the assault on the deceased in furtherance of the

common criminal purpose of causing the death of the deceased and one of them struck the

fatal blow, even if it was not the Accused, the then Accused will be guilty of murder

The above-mentioned dictum was referred to by Eric Basnayake J in Werrappulige

Upasena and eight others Vs. Attorney General CA6-8/2003 decided on 22.08.2006.

Sir Madhavan Nair in Mahubub shab v Emperor A.I.R (32) 1945 Privy Council

118 on page 120 held that;

In 1870, it was amended by the insertion of the words in furtherance of the

common intention of all after the word: persons and before the word each, so as to

make the object of the section clear. Section 34 lays down a principle of joint liability in

the doing of a criminal act. The section does not say the common intention of all nor does

it say an intention common to all. Under the section, the essence of that liability is to

be found in existence of a common intention animating the accused leading to the doing

of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention, in invoke the aid of S.34 successfully, it

must be shown that the criminal act complained against was done by one of the accused

persons in the furtherance of the common intention of all; if this is shown, then liability

for the crime may be imposed on any one of the persons in the same manner as if the act

Page 9 of 13

were done by him alone. This being the principle, it is clear to their Lordships that

common intention within the meaning of the section implies a pre-arranged plan, and to

convict the accused of an offence applying the section it should be proved that the criminal

act was done in concert pursuant to the prearranged plan. As has been often observed, it

is difficult if not impossible to procure direct evidence to prove the intention of an

individual; in most cases, it has to be inferred from his act or conduct or other relevant

circumstances of the case.

The above proposition was followed by Soertsz A C. J. in the case of the King v,

Ranasinghe . 1947 NLR On p. 375 held that;

As pointed out by their Lordships of the Privy Council in the recent case

of Marbub Shan V. Emperor Care must be taken not to confuse same or similar intention

with common intention; the partition which divides their bounds is often very thin;

nevertheless the distinction is real and substantial and if overlooked will result in

miscarriage of justice. In their Lordships opinion, the inference of common intention

within the meaning of the term in section 34 (i.e., sect on 32 Ceylon) should never be

reached unless it is necessary inference and it appears to us that, in the circumstances of

the case before us too, it would be safer not to draw the inference of a common intention

.There is no evidence at all of any prearrangement or even of any declaration or of any

other significant fact at the time of the assault to enable one to say more than that the

assailants had the same or similar intentions entertained independently by each of them.

In King v. Piyadasa 48 NLR page 295 Howard CJ has considered the ditum of

Mahbub Shah v. Emperor and held that;

In the present case there is really no evidence of a pre-arranged plan. There is no

evidence of any connection between the first accused and the three others prior to the

assault. It is not clear what the second, third and fourth accused were doing and where

they had been prior to their arrival on the scene. Nor during the assault did the four

accused say anything to indicate that they, were acting in furtherance of a pre-arranged

plan. It is true that they all seem to have been armed with the same type of weapon.

Moreover the second, third and fourth accused joined in the attack on the deceased very

soon after he had been hit on the head by the first accused. This circumstantial evidence

does not in our opinion place beyond all reasonable doubt the question as to whether they

all shared a common intention to commit the offence of murder.

Page 10 of 13

Basnayake, CJ in The Queen v. Vincent Fernando 65 NLR 265 held that,

A person who does a criminal act by himself is liable for that act if it offends any

provision of the penal law. The above section does not deal with the liability of a person

for the criminal act he himself does but with his liability for the criminal acts of others.

What are the prerequisites of such liability? Several persons must have a common

intention to do a criminal act, they must all do that act in furtherance of the common

intention of all. In such a case each person becomes liable for that act in the same manner

as if it were done by him alone. By virtue of the definition of " act " in section 31 of the

Penal Code, the application of the section also extends to a series of criminal acts done by

several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all. There are more cases which

fall within the extended application than within the unextended. Now where a series of

criminal acts is done by several persons, each act would be done either jointly or severally.

But whether the criminal acts in the series of criminal acts are done jointly or severally if

each criminal act is done in furtherance of the common intention of all each of the persons

sharing the common intention and doing any act in the series of criminal acts is not only

liable for his own act but is also liable for the acts of the others in the same manner as if

it were done by him alone. For instance, if a man is done to death by several blows struck

by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each person is liable not

only for the blow dealt by him but he is also liable for each of the blows dealt by the others

in the same manner as if all the blows were dealt by him alone, and where death results

from the blow of one of them and it appears that the common intention of all was to cause

death, each of those who did criminal acts in furtherance of the common intention of all

is liable for the at of the person whose blow resulted in the death of the deceased. It is not

necessary to prove who struck the fatal blow. A person who merely shares the criminal

intention, or takes a fiendish delight in what is happening but does no criminal act in

furtherance of the common intention of all is not liable for the acts of the others. To be

liable under section 32 a mental sharing of the common intention is not sufficient, the

sharing must be evidenced by a criminal act. The Code does not make punishable a mental

state however wicked it may be unless it is accompanied by a criminal act which manifests

the state of mind. In the Penal Code words which refer to acts done extend also to illegal

omissions (s. 30). What has been stated above in regard to criminal acts therefore apply

to illegal omissions as well. (emphasis added)

Punchibanda v. The Queen 74 NLR 494, Sirimane, J in held that;.

The evidence, in our view, falls short of establishing a common-murderous

intention shared by the appellants.

Learned Crown Counsel submitted that if the 2nd and the 3rd Accused appellants

had formed a common intention with the 1st Accused-appellant to merely assault the

deceased, and if the 1st Accused-appellant stabbed him to death, then, even if the 2nd and

the 3rd Accused-appellants had no knowledge that the 1st Accused-appellant was armed,

or that he would use the knife to kill the deceased, still, they (the 2nd and the 3rd Accused-

appellants) would be guilty of murder. In other words, that under section 32 of the Penal

Code a person can be found guilty of murder on the basis of common intention, even if

that person did not share a murderous intention with the person who actually committed

the act, if the act was done in furtherance of a common intention to commit some other

offence. No authority was cited to us for this proposition. On the contrary, our Courts have

always held that a common murderous intention must be shared before a person can be

convicted of murder on an application of section 32. (see e.g. King v. Assappu)

In our view, before a person can be held vicariously responsible for the criminal

act of another under section 32, the prosecution must prove that such a person shared a

common intention to commit that particular act. (emphasis added)

In Banda and Others v. Attorney General, 1999 (3) SLR 168 Jayasuriya J. held

that;

It is manifest that learned trial Judge has used the term common intention only in one

solitary passage in his judgment at page 181, He has culpably failed to consider the acts

of participation on the part of each one of those Accused separately, to analyse these acts

and relate them to the principles of law relating to common intention and having regard

to their respective acts to determine whether they were actuated by a common intention.

Justice Dias in King v. Asappu (1) laid down the principles that it is the bounden duty of

the trial Judge to indulge in this process and that the same duty prevails even when the

Accused is tried without a Jury. Further, the trial Judge has not given his mind in regard

to counts six and seven and considered whether the Accused were actuated by a common

murderous intention to commit the offence set out in counts six and seven. Justice

Sirimane in Punchi Banda v. Queen(2) set aside the conviction in a situation where the

trial Judge had not distinguished between the required common murderous intention and

any other common intention entertained by the Accused. This is an error made by the

Page 12 of 13

instant Judge when he failed to consider whether the Accused were actuated by a common

murderous intention. These non-directions and mis-directions are in regard to vital

aspects of the prosecution case and related to the ingredients of the offence and therefore

the findings, convictions and sentences pronounced cannot be sustained.(emphasis

added)

In Mapalagama Acharige Ariyaratne v. The Attorney General, SC 31/92, Decided

on 05.11.1993,(1993 BLR Vol. V. Part 01, Page 01,). G.P.S. De Silva. CJ held that;

It is well-settled law that the interference of a common intention must be not

merely a possible inference but a necessary inference, that is to say, an inference from

which there is no escape.

Fernando and Others v. The Queen, 54 NLR 255 at 260. At the most, the

prosecution is left only with the presence of the appellant at the scene, and that too not

at the time of the attack upon the deceased. It is a strict rule that presence alone cannot

suffice to establish a common intention.

The appellant could have been convicted of murder only on the basis that he shared

a common murderous intention with. There is no acceptable evidence to support such a

finding. The verdict of the Jury is clearly unreasonable, having regard to the evidence.

The appeal is accordingly allowed., the conviction and sentence of the appellant are set

aside and the appellant is acquitted. (emphasis added)

Considering the above facts and the judgment about the common intention there

is no evidence that the 2nd and 4th Accused were present when the said incident took place.

The prosecution has failed to prove that they (the 2nd and 4th Accused) shared a murderous

intention with the 1st and 3rd Accused who caused the murder of the deceased.

The issue before us is whether the 2nd and 4th Accused have shared the common

intention, there is no evidence to show that they came together. Also, there is no evidence

to show that there was a pre-arranged plan or they were there at the time of the incident.

We also note that there is no iota of evidence to prove the 2nd and 4th Accused

shared murder intention with the 1st and the 3rd Accused.

Page 13 of 13

Since there is no acceptable evidence to support such a finding, the conviction is

unreasonable. Therefore we set aside the conviction and sentence of the appellant. Both

the 2nd and 4th Accused Appellants are acquitted.

Appeal Allowed.
