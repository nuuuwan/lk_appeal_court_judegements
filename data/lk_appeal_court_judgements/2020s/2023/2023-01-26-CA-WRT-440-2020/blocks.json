The second application of the principle is where a judge is not a party to the suit and does not have a financial interest in its outcome, but in some other way his conduct or behavior may give rise to a suspicion that he is not impartial, for example because of his friendship with a party.

It is observed by this Court that, even if there are provisions in law, empowering the authorities to remove a member from his position, the authorities can do so only within the scope of the principles of natural justice.

In a nineteenth-century feudal set-up, the unfettered power and discretion of the Crown were not an alien concept. However, in a democracy governed by the Rule of Law, where arbitrariness in any form is eschewed, no Government or Authority has the right to do what it pleases. The doctrine of pleasure does not mean a licence to act arbitrarily, capriciously or whimsically. It is presumed that discretionary powers conferred in absolute and unfettered terms on any public authority will necessarily and obviously be exercised reasonably and for the public good.",
