Before: M. T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. Counsel: Shantha Jayawardena, with Ms. Hirannya Damunupola and Azra Basheer for the Petitioners. S. Dharmawardena, ASG with M. Fernando, SC for the Respondents. Supported on: 26.06.2023 Written Submissions on: 14.09.2023 by the Petitioners 09.10.2023 by the Respondents Decided on: 17.10.2023 MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioners were employed as casual labourers by the Department of Highways. On 01-01-1986, the functions and activities carried out by the Department of Highways had been transferred to the Road Development Authority. Accordingly, the services of all casual and temporary labourers were terminated with effect from 01-01-1985. The Petitioners were paid a sum of Rs. 20,000/- as a bonus payment and they were not paid pension.

Thereafter, in terms of the Public Administration Circular No. 09/2015 (P6), the Petitioners made an appeal to the Ministry of Public Administration Local Government and Democratic Governance. On 15-03-2016, a Cabinet Memorandum bearing No. 2016/13 (P10) was submitted by the Minister of Higher Education and Highways seeking approval of the Cabinet of Ministers for a one-time payment of Rs. 25,000/= to the workers who lost their jobs when the Department of Highways was abolished and for the allocation of funds for the purpose, whereas on 03-05-2016, the Cabinet refused to recommend the said Memorandum (P11). The Petitioners state that on 21-06-2016 (P14) the Cabinet approved the Cabinet Memorandum dated 10-06-2016 (P13) submitted by the Minister of Public Administration and Management seeking to implement the Public Administration Circular No. 09/2015. The Petitioners further state that the Secretary to the Minister of Higher Education and Highways by letter dated 10-07-2017 (P17) instructed the 3rd Respondent (Director General of Pension) to take necessary arrangements to retire those who had a service of 08 years in the Department of Highways with effect from 01-04-2016, and to process a payment of pension amounting to Rs. 10,000/- per month with effect from 01-04-2016. Further, it was recommended to pay a one-time payment amounting to Rs. 50,000/- for the workers who had not completed 08 years of service. The Petitioners state that the 3rd Respondent failed to comply with the instructions stipulated in P17. By letter dated 28-02-2019 marked as P30, the 6th Respondent, the Senior Assistant Secretary of the Ministry of Highways and Road Development informed the 1st Petitioner that the said Cabinet Memorandum marked as P10 submitted by the Minister of Higher Education and Highways in this regard has been rejected by the Cabinet on 03-05-2016.

In those circumstances, the Petitioners state that the 1st and 3rd Respondents are under a public duty to implement the Cabinet Decision marked as P14 and are acting unreasonably, arbitrarily, in frustration of the Petitioners legitimate expectation and ultra-vires. Hence, the Petitioners are seeking inter-alia a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision reflected in P30, a Writ of

Page 7 of 9

Mandamus directing the 1st and 3rd Respondents to take necessary steps to retire the Petitioners with effect from 01-04-2016 in accordance with P17 and a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and 3rd Respondents to act in accordance with the Cabinet Decision reflected in P14 and implement the same.

As per the Cabinet Memorandum pertaining to the winding up of the Department of Highways dated 15-08-1985 marked as 6RA2, the Petitioners were paid a sum of Rs. 20,000/- each as compensation. The Petitioners who received compensation had also signed the documents marked 6RA3, consenting that this is a full and final payment. It is borne out from the document marked as 6RA3, that the Petitioners, those who are entitled, were paid gratuity payments as well.

Subsequently, on 15-03-2016, a Cabinet Memorandum bearing No. 2016/13 (P10) was submitted by the Minister of Higher Education and Highways seeking approval from the Cabinet of Ministers to provide relief to the workers who lost their jobs when the Department of Highways was abolished. By P11, the Cabinet Memorandum to provide relief to the said workers was refused by the Cabinet. The Secretary of the Ministry of Public Administration by letter dated 21-03-2018 marked as R9 requested the Secretary of the Ministry of Highways to inform the Petitioners as to the said decision of the Cabinet. In this scenario, it is abundantly clear that the Petitioners are not entitled to pension or any other relief as the same was not approved by the Cabinet.

The Petitioners are seeking a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and 3rd Respondents to act in accordance with the Cabinet Decision reflected in P14. The Cabinet Memorandum dated 10-06-2016 (P13) submitted by the Minister of Public Administration and Management seeking to implement the Public Administration Circular No. 09/2015 and the approval granted by the Cabinet to the same is in relation to the persons who were subjected to political victimization, such

Page 8 of 9

decision of the Cabinet is based on policy approval. Hence, it is apparent that the said Circular No. 09/2015, Cabinet Memorandum P13 and Cabinet Decision P14 do not relate to the employees (Petitioners) of the Department of Highways. This Court is mindful of the fact that the services of the Petitioners were terminated not due to political victimization but due to the abolition of the Department of Highways. In this respect, it is the view of this Court that the Petitioners are not entitled to seek any relief in terms of the Cabinet Decision marked as P14.

The Petitioners are seeking a Writ of Mandamus directing the 3rd Respondent to take necessary steps to retire the Petitioners in accordance with P17, which is a letter dispatched by the Secretary to the Minister of Higher Education and Highways, instructing the 3rd Respondent (Director General of Pension) to take necessary arrangements to retire those who had a service of 08 years in the Department of Highways with effect from 01-04-2016, and to process a payment of pension amounting to Rs. 10,000/- per month with effect from 01-04-2016. The Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the Respondents vehemently disputing this letter on the footing that Mr. H.M.P. Bandara, the Secretary to the Minister of Higher Education and Highways had no authority to give such a direction to the Director General of Pension. It is pertinent to note that, Mr. H.M.P. Bandara, author of P17 was released from the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways on 21-11-2016 by letter dated 21-11-2016 marked as 6RA5, and therefore, Mr. H.M.P. Bandara had no authority to issue the letter marked P17. Moreover, it appears to this Court that P17 is illegal and ultra-vires as it is against the Cabinet Decision marked as P11. It is to be noted that the public Officers have no authority to give directions to other public Officers or public bodies against the Decisions of the Cabinet. Hence, the Petitioners are not entitled to seek relief in terms of P17 as well.

The Petitioners are seeking to quash the letter marked as P30, by which the 6th Respondent, the Senior Assistant Secretary of the Ministry of Highways and Road Development informed the 1st Petitioner that the said Cabinet Memorandum marked as P10 submitted by the Minister of Higher Education and Highways has

Page 9 of 9

been rejected by the Cabinet on 03-05-2016. P30 is not a decision to be quashed by way of a Writ of Certiorari but it is only a notification of the Cabinet decision marked as P11 by the Senior Assistant Secretary of the Ministry of Highways and Road Development to the 1st Petitioner. As such, P30 is not liable to be quashed.

For the foregoing reasons, it is the considered view of this Court that the Petitioners are not entitled to the relief as prayed for in the prayers to the Petition. Thus, the Application is dismissed. No costs.

Application dismissed.
