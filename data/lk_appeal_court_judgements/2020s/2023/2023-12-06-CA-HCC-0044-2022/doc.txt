JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo under Sections 54(A) (b) and 54(A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for

Trafficking and Possession of 23.86 grams of Heroin (diacetylmorphine) on

05th April 2016.

After trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the Learned

High Court Judge of Colombo has imposed life imprisonment on the both

counts on 08/12/2021.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given her consent to argue this matter in her absence due to the Covid

19 pandemic. At the hearing, the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. Learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider that the

prosecution failed to establish the chain of custody.

2. Learned High Court Judge erred in law by not granting the accused the

benefit of doubt surrounding the two receipts issued by the

Government Analyst.

3. Learned High Court Judge erred by failing to resolve the discrepancy

between the two different weights of the heroin.

4. Learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider the

elements necessary to constitute the offence of trafficking.

Background of the case.

In this case the raid was conducted in absence of any specific information

received. The raid was headed by PW1 with team of police officers from the

Anti-Corruption Unit of Harbour Police Station. All have been named as

witnesses in the indictment including the Government Analyst. The

prosecution had called PW1, PW2, PW5, PW7, PW12, PW14 and the

Government Analyst and closed the case after marking production P1-P11.

When the defence was called, the Appellant made a dock statement and

closed the case.

On 05/04/2016 IP/Champika attached to the Anti-Corruption Unit of

Harbour Police Station had gone for a routine narcotics raid with a team of

police officers to Kosgas Junction via Ingurukade Junction. At about 12.35

noon PW1 Champika and PW2, Dayaratna walked along the Stacepura Road

towards Orugodawatte Junction after stopping their vehicle in front of

Wijeyaba Vidyalaya. Walking down the road, they had come near a petrol

shed. Thereafter, the duo had walked along a road called Awwal Saviya Road

which is situated opposite to the petrol shed. On walking along Awwal Saviya

Road, the duo had seen the Appellant coming towards Stacepura Road.

Having seen PW1 and PW2, the Appellant turned back immediately which

CA/HCC/44/22

arose the suspicion of the police officers. They ran towards the Appellant and

stopped her for questioning. At that time, the police officers had observed a

pink coloured cellophane bag with something in it in the right-handed

clenched fist. PW1 took the parcel into his custody and inspected the same.

The parcel contained some brown coloured substance. As it reacted for

Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) the Appellant was arrested immediately. The

Appellant was taken to the Letchumi Jewellers situated in Kosgas Junction

to weigh the substance. The Appellant was taken to the Jewellers only by

PW1 and PW2. The parcel contained 100.500 grams of substances. After

entering notes, the Appellant and the productions were handed over to the

Grandpass Police Station at about 15.00 hours under PR No.152/2016.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person and this burden never

shifts. Hence an accused person has no burden to prove his case unless he

pleads a general or a special exception in the Penal Code.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are

of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions.

In the Attorney-General v. Rawther 25 NLR 385, Ennis, J. states thus: [1987} 1 SLR 155

"The evidence must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence.

His innocence is presumed in law, from the start of the case, and his

guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.

CA/HCC/44/22

5 | P a g e

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:

the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required in

a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree is

well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree of

probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond

the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it

admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the

evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility

in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence, of course it is

possible, but not in the least probable, the case is proved beyond

reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.

As the appeal grounds raised by the Appellant are inter-related, the grounds

will be considered together in this case.

The chain of custody is the most important of evidence in a drug related trial.

The prosecution has the paramount duty to prove that it is the same

production recovered at the time of detection. The main reason is to establish

that the evidence, which is related to the alleged crime, was collected from

the accused and was in its original condition rather than having been

tempered with or planted deceitfully to make someone else guilty. Handling

of production evidence is a lengthy process but the court necessitates it for

the adjudication of the case. This proves the integrity of production which

had been recovered and until it reaches to the Government Analyst

Department.

The defence can challenge the chain of custody evidence by questioning

whether the evidence presented at trial is the same evidence as what was

collected from an accused person. If there is any discrepancy in the chain of

custody of a production and the prosecution is unable to prove who had the

custody of production until it reached the analyst, the chain of custody

stands broken.

CA/HCC/44/22

6 | P a g e

According to PW1 he had handed over the production PR 152/16 on

05.04.2016 to PW5 PC 17812 Ananda. On the following day morning, the

production was handed over to PW7 PC 18755 Vishvapala. PW7 again

handed over the production to PW 05. On 06.04.2016 PW5 had handed over

the production to PW10 PS 28070 Rohana who took the same to the

Maligakanda Magistrate Court and produced it under Case No. B/8862/16.

The prosecution had neither called PW10 Rohana to give evidence nor led

evidence through PW5 to establish that PW5 had received the same from

PW10 Rohana. Hence, there is no evidence to show what was returned by

PW10 Rohana was the same item that was produced in the Magistrate Court

of Maligakanda under PR No. 152/16.

This shows a clear break in the custody chain which need to be proved

beyond reasonable doubt in a case of this nature. Without a proper chain of

custody, drugs do not come in as evidence. The discrepancies highlighted

above cannot be ignored lightly, as the entire case rests on the cogent and

unambiguous evidence pertaining to the chain of production.

In Perera V. Attorney General [1998] 1 Sri.L.R 378 it was held:

the most important journey is the inward journey because the final

analyst report will depend on that.

In Witharana Doli Nona v.The Republic of Sri Lanka CA/19/99 His

Lordship Justice de Abrew remarked thus;

It is a recognized principle that in drug related cases the prosecution

must prove the chain relating to the inward journey. The purpose of this

principle is to establish that the productions have not been tampered

with. Prosecution must prove that the productions taken from the

accused Appellant was examined by the Government Analyst

CA/HCC/44/22

7 | P a g e

In the above cited judgments, the Court has highlighted the importance of

proving the production evidence in a drug related trial.

Although there is a missing link in the production which was sent to the

Government Analyst Department, the Learned High Court Judge in his

judgment had not taken into cognisance of this fact.

This missing link got further aggravated of the issue of the receipt by the

Government Analyst Department. After receiving the production from PW12

the Government Analyst Department had issued the receipt stating that it

received two parcels from PW12. The said receipt was marked as P-9 by the

prosecution.

14 days after receiving the production, PW 14, the Government Analyst had

issued an amended receipt dated 20.04.2016 stating that the Government

Analyst had received only one parcel. Even though the amended receipt

which was marked as P-10 dated 20.04.2016, the same had been received

by the Court on 29.06.2016.

Although the Government Analyst report was dated 27.05.2016, the Court

had received the same on 03.06.2016. This is evident as the Government

Analyst had sent the second receipt after the report was prepared and sent

to Court which is approximately after one month. This too had escaped the

attention of the Learned High Court Judge.

According to the prosecution, the raid was done without specific information.

According to PW1, who knew the Appellant earlier had arrested after only

checking her clenched fist. But she was never subjected to a body check even

though a woman police constable (PW8) was included in the raiding team.

Even the WPC was not utilized to escort the Appellant to jewellery shop when

PW1 had weighed the production. Only PW1 and PW2 escorted the Appellant

to the jewellery shop.

Although PW1 admitted that he knew the Appellant earlier, he had not taken

any endeavour to check her house.

CA/HCC/44/22

8 | P a g e

The Appellant in her dock statement took up the position that on the date of

the incident she was arrested at her house and not on the Awwal Saviya

Road as claimed by PW1 and PW2.

Even though the dock statement of an accused has less evidential value, our

courts never hesitate to accept the same when it creates a doubt on the

prosecution case. In this case, I consider it is very important to consider the

dock statement of the Appellant.

In Don Samantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha v. The Attorney General

CA/303/2006 decided on 11/07/2012 the court held that:

Whether the evidence of the defence or the dock statement is sufficient

to create a doubt cannot be decided in a vacuum or in isolation because

it needs to be considered in the totality of the evidence that is in the light

of the evidence for the prosecution as well as the defence.

In Kathubdeen v. Republic of Sri Lanka [1998] 3 SLR 107 the court held

that:

It is settled law that an unsworn statement must be treated as

evidence. It has also been laid down that if the unsworn statement

creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case or if it is believed,

then the accused should be given the benefit of that doubt.

The way how the raid was conducted by two male officers without using a

woman police constable even to conduct further investigation raises serious

doubt about the prosecutions story.

Therefore, the prosecutions case has failed to pass the probability test in

this case. Had the Learned Trial Judge looked in to the evidence presented

in its correct perspective, he should have accepted the explanation given by

the Appellant.

CA/HCC/44/22

9 | P a g e

In this case PW1 and PW2 are the key witnesses and if their evidence is clear,

cogent and unambiguous the court could without any hesitation rely on their

evidence and convict the Appellant. But as discussed above the evidence

given by prosecution witnesses, in my view, had not passed the probability

test. It is tainted with much ambiguity and uncertainty which definitely affect

the root of the case.

Guided by the above cited judicial decisions, I conclude that the appeal

grounds advanced by the Appellant have very serious impact on the

prosecution case.

As the prosecution had failed its duty to prove this case beyond reasonable

doubt, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the Learned High

Court Judge of Colombo dated 08/12/2021 on the Appellant. Therefore, she

is acquitted from this case.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
