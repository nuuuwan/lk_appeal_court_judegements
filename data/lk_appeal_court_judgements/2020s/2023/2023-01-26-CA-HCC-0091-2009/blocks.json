This is an ordinary sense of doubt. But when the driver is under heavy influence of liquor and drives really fast, you will have a reasonable doubt of meeting with an accident. Therefore, you would have understood what \"beyond reasonable doubt\" is. And the \"reasonable doubt\" is not decided by you. It is a matter decided by you from those circumstances.

In the present case the learned trial Judge did not caution the jury regarding the correct legal position which applies under section 24 and section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance. There is no presumption in law that confession made by an accused person to a Police Officer was voluntarily made. Thus, it is the responsibility and the duty of the prosecution to prove and to convince the jury that the confessions made by the accused persons were made voluntarily. In the present case it is my view that there is no proof to say, the two accused persons have made the confessions and the statements on section 27 recovery, were done voluntarily. In my view it is absolute misdirection relating to section 27 recovery and voluntariness under section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance on confessions as they were not sufficiently addressed and explained to the accused persons by the learned High Court Judge.",
