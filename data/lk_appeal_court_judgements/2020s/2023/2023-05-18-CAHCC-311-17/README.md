Decided on: 10.05.2023

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeal has been lodged to set aside the judgment dated

31.10.2017 of the High Court of Chilaw.

The accused appellant had been indicted for a charge of murder under

the Penal Code. The appellant had pleaded not guilty and upon

conclusion of the trial the learned judge had convicted him for the same

and had passed the death sentence. Hence upon being aggrieved by the

sentence and conviction the instant appeal had been filed.

But at argument stage both parties agreed that they prefer for the Court

to consider finding the appellant guilty for culpable homicide not

amounting to murder based on a sudden fight.

The Counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant was the

brother of the deceased wife and the deceased had been in the habit of

harassing the deceased wife upon being drunk and on the day of the

incident the deceased had come drunk and had started his usual fight

with the wife and the appellant had intervened.

The Counsel for the respondent brought to the notice of Court the

number of injuries on the deceased and the nature of the fatal injury on

the deceased.

Upon considering the submissions of both parties we observe that the

deceased had been in the habit of frequently quarrelling with his wife

and thereafter beating her and the appellant being the brother had

intervened which had ensued it to be an altercation which the appellant

did not expect t.

Hence as urged by both sides the conviction for murder is set aside and

we find the appellant guilty for culpable homicide not amounting to

murder based on a sudden fight we sentence to appellant for seven years

rigorous imprisonment to be operative from the date of conviction and a

fine of rupees 25000 is imposed in default 6 months imprisonment.

Subject to the above variation the instant appeal ids dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
