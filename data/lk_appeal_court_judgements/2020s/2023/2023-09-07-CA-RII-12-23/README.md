This is an application of revision and restitutio in integrum submitted by the

Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as petitioner) to set

aside the Judgment and Decree Nisi dated 04.04.2013 and Decree Absolute

dated 24.02.2014 in the case bearing No. D/1555/2012 entered by the

District Court of Nugegoda.

The case bearing No. D/1555/2012 was a divorce action instituted before the

District Court of Nugegoda by the petitioners deceased husband (Namely, the

late Upali Mervin Senerath Dassanayake).

The salient facts of the case are as follows. The petitioner states that the

petitioner and the late Upali Dassanayake entered matrimony on 02.01.1976.

The petitioner claims they gave birth to a son and daughter on 12.11.1977

and 28.04.1981 respectively. The petitioner also claimed the late Upali

Dassanayake had engaged in numerous extramarital affairs which led to the

petitioner leaving the matrimonial home around 1995 yet had contact with

the late husband for the sake of children. However, the late Upali

Dassanayake passed away from decompensated cirrhosis on 05.01.2021. And

upon the death of the late Upali Dassanayake the petitioner states she

exercised legal rights to claim his pension payment as a Member of Parliament

from 1987 1993. Upon claiming for the payment of pension the petitioner

was informed that the payment had already been claimed by the respondent

who claimed to be the late Upali Dassanayakes legal wife. Subsequent to the

above information the petitioner states she became aware that the late

estranged husband Upali Dassanayake had filed a divorce action and had

obtained a decree of vinculo matrimonii against her (case bearing No.

D/1555/2012). The petitioner states that she was unaware about the

proceedings of the above case and the plaintiff of the case bearing No.

D/1555/2012 who is the late husband of the petitioner has deliberately

misdirected the courts to issue summons to an address where the petitioner

does not reside.

Upon consideration of the facts and submissions made on 26.07.2023 by the

counsel for the petitioner, this Court has already ordered formal notice to

CA-RII-12-23 Page 4 of 7 07/09/2023 IJ-26-23

respondents. Furthermore, while the counsel for the petitioner was supporting

the case he reiterated and requested the court to grant an interim order

(Prayer f of the petition) staying the operation of the judgment dated

04.04.2013 and/or the Decree Absolute dated 24.02.2014 entered in the

Divorce case bearing No. D/1555/2012 until the final hearing and

determination of this application.

It is prima facie evident that the Decree Nisi and the Decree Absolute has been

entered, far back in 04.04.2013 and 24.02.2014 respectively. And thereby the

matter of concern at this juncture is to ascertain whether or not this Court

should grant the stay order.

According to the submissions made by both parties on 26.07.2023 there are

two ongoing testamentary cases. One testamentary case was filed by the

petitioner and deceaseds daughter at the District Court of Colombo (Case

Bearing No. 165/2021/DTS) seeking a Letter of Administration concerning

the properties of the said deceased Upali Dassanayake. Another testamentary

case was filed by the respondent of the instant application at the District Court

of Kuliyapitiya (Case Bearing No. 812/T) seeking letter of Probate based on a

Last Will bearing No.3921 dated 30.07.2020 attested by K. Sumanasuriya N.P.

However, this Court holds the view that the inheritance or succession of Late

Dissanayake's estate shall be determined upon the conclusion of the

aforementioned testamentary action/s.

Furthermore, another concern was raised over which party is entitled to claim

and benefit from the pension of the late Upali Dassanayake. During the

submissions made by the counsel for the petitioner it was stated that upon

the death of late Upali Dassanayake, the petitioner had exercised her legal

rights to claim the pension payment of the late Upali Dassanayake who served

as a Member of Parliament from 1987 - 1993. However, upon the application

made to the parliament, the petitioner states that she was informed that the

pension payment is already being claimed by the respondent of the instant

application who claims to state she is the legal wife of the late Upali

Dassanayake. And further conceded that the respondent is enjoying the

benefit up to date.

CA-RII-12-23 Page 5 of 7 07/09/2023 IJ-26-23

Nevertheless, when examining the documents provided to the instant

application it is evident the petitioner has not submitted any relevant

documentation to prove the refusal by the parliament with regard to the

pension payment she claimed.

When the instant application was supported by the counsel for the petitioner,

it was reiterated that there are two main prayers for the case. Requesting the

issue of formal notice and granting of interim relief. Since the court already

ordered to issue notice to respondents, the current concern is whether the

courts will grant an interim order staying the proceedings of the case bearing

No. D/1555/2012. When an application is filed before the court, it is the duty

of the courts to consider various factors prior to the issuance of interim relief.

Inter alia:

Balance of convenience: The court should consider the balance of

convenience between the petitioner and the respondent. It will weigh

the potential harm to the petitioner if the stay order does not stay the

proceedings of the divorce case bearing No. D/1555/2012 against any

harm the stay order may cause the respondents if the stay order is

granted and stays the proceedings.

Irreparable damage: The court should assess whether allowing

judgment of the case bearing No. D/1555/2012 to proceed would cause

irreparable damage to the petitioners. This damage should be

substantial and difficult to compensate for, if the petitioner ultimately

succeed in her arguments.

It is evident that if the interim relief is not granted the respondent will continue

to claim and benefit from the pension and on the other hand even if the interim

relief is granted then the petitioner is not able to claim for the pension

payment. This would also thereby mean that if the stay order is granted the

respondent will not be able to claim for the pension she has been drawing for

since the death of late Upali Dassanayake in January 2021. As such, when

applying the principles mentioned above, even though the petitioner has

managed to establish a prima facie case, she has not demonstrated that the

burden of proving the existence of irreparable damage or the balance of

CA-RII-12-23 Page 6 of 7 07/09/2023 IJ-26-23

convenience rests with her to warrant granting interim relief. Consequently,

at this juncture, this court declines to grant interim relief.

The above contention is well supported by a plethora of authorities reported

in the English Courts and in the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal as

well. In American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] AC 396: This

landmark case established the American Cyanamid guidelines for granting

interim injunctions in judicial review cases. It emphasized the need for a

"prima facie" case, balancing the potential harm to the parties involved and

the overall public interest. This case recognized that the court may refuse to

grant an interim order even if the petitioner demonstrates a prima facie case.

In, R (on the application of Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and

Commonwealth Affairs (No. 3) [2008] UKHL 61: In this case, the House of

Lords refused to grant an interim order to suspend the implementation of a

government decision despite the petitioner demonstrating a prima facie case

of illegality. The court weighed the balance of convenience and the public

interest in the government's decision.

In a recent judgment of the Court of Appeal, CA/WRIT/354/2022 decided on

14.10.2022, Sobhitha Rajakaruna J. stated The Judges exercising the

jurisdiction in judicial review have enlarged the scope of granting interim

orders by following stringent principles and also sometimes taking lenient

approach to issue or not issue interim reliefs. In many instances the review

Judge has refused to issue interim orders even after being satisfied that the

Petitioner has submitted a prima facie case. His lordship further goes on and

quote an Indian authority of Assistant Collector, C.E., Chandan Nagar vs.

Dunlop India Ltd., AIR 985 SC 330, where the Supreme Court of India has

observed; . it is of utmost importance to realize that interim

orders ought not to be granted merely because a prima facie case has been

shown. More is required. The balance of convenience must be clearly in favour

of making an interim order and there should not be the slightest indication of a

likelihood of prejudice to the public interest.

Another contention that was brought forward by the counsel for the petitioner

was the legality of the decree obtained at the District Court in the case bearing

No. D/1555/2012. However, through the submissions made by the

CA-RII-12-23 Page 7 of 7 07/09/2023 IJ-26-23

Presidents Counsel for the respondent it was stated that there is prima facie

evidence (R2 Marriage Certificate) to prove that the respondent is legally

married on the 16.04.2014 to the late Upali Dassanayake subsequent to the

divorce proceedings of the petitioner and the late Upali Dassanayake. Whether

he had a capacity to enter into a legal marriage is to be considered after

conclusion of the main arguments of this case.

Thereby this Court sees no reasonable ground for the granting of interim relief.

Since formal notice has already been issued to the respondent, this Court is

of the view that the objections can be filed within a short period of time and

subsequently the matter can be concluded expeditiously.

Refuse to grant interim relief.
