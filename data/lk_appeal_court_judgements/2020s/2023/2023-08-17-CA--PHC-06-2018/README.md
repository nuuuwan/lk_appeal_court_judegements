Judgment

When this appeal came up before us for argument on 01.02.2023, both Counsel appearing

for the Appellant and the Respondent agreed to dispose of this matter by way of written

submissions.

Pursuant to which the Court granted dates to file written submissions for the Appellant on or

before 02/05/2023 and for the Respondent on or before 12.06.2023.

However, when this matter was called on 12.06.2023 to fix for judgment as both parties had

failed to written submissions on due time, the court granted a further date for both parties to

file written submissions on or before 01.07.2023 and reserved the case for judgment for

04.08.2023.

It appears that Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant had filed written submissions on

05.07.2023 but no written submissions have been filed by the Respondent-Petitioner-

Respondent.

However, the judgment was not delivered on 04.08.2023 and it was postponed to

07.08.2023. As the Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent had not filed written submissions

after agreeing to dispose of the matter on written submissions, this judgment is be based on

the material placed before Court by parties in their pleadings and the contents of the available

written submissions.

Page 4 of 10

The Petitioner, namely Balasooriya Arachchilage Gamini instituted action bearing no

58924/2010 in the Magistrate Court of Warakapola against the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents

under section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Court Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979.

The learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge having inquired into the

matter by way of Affidavits, counter affidavits, and written submissions filed by the parties,

delivered the order on 01.12.2010 in favour of the Petitioner declaring that he is entitled to

the possession of the subject land of the instant action.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned Magistrate, 1st and 2nd Respondent-

Petitioner invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of

Sabaragamauwa Province holden in Kegalle seeking to revise or set aside the said order of

the learned Magistrate.

However, the learned Provincial High Court Judge pronounced her order on 10.08.2012

dismissing the revision application made by 1st and 2nd Respondent-Petitioners on the ground

that no exceptional circumstances were established by the Respondent-Petitioner to revise

the order of the learned Magistrate.

The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant, being dissatisfied with the said Order of the learned

High Court Judge had preferred CA (PHC) 82/2012 to the Court of Appeal seeking to set

aside the order of the learned High Court Judge dated 10.08.2012.

Subsequently, the Court of Appeal set aside the Order/Judgment of the learned High Court

Judge and referred the matter to the Provincial High Court of Kegalle directing the learned

High Court Judge to entertain the said revision application and hear the parties and enter an

order/judgment on its merit, according to law.

Subsequently, the learned High Court Judge inquired about the matter and allowed the

revision application of the Respondent-Petitioner and set aside the order dated 01.12.2010

pronounced by the learned Magistrate. Apparently, the learned Provincial High Court Judge

decided that 1st and 2nd Respondent-Petitioners are entitled to the possession of the subject

matter by his order dated 18.01.2018.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant has preferred this

Appeal seeking reliefs prayed in the prayer to the Petition of Appeal.

Facts of the case:

One Nana Suna Pana Subramanium Chettiar sold an undevided 1/3rd share of the subjsct

land to the Appellant the said B.A. Gamini.

Page 5 of 10

The balance undevided 2/3rd from the subject land was bought by the said B.A. Gaimini the

Appellant from the heirs of another owner.

In the year 1990, one Heenbanda made a complaint to the police station against B.A Gamini,

the Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant]

alleging criminal trespass into the subject land in the instant action.

Thereafter, the said B.A Gamini, being the accused in the said criminal trespass case bearing

no 14244 M.C. Warakapola had been prosecuted. Eventually, the accused B.A Gamini was

discharged from the said case upon certain conditions.

According to those conditions, the said Heenbanda undertook to institute a civil action to get

his rights to the subject land in question within a period of 3 months. Similarly, during this

three-month period, both parties agreed not to enter the premises in suit. In the event of

failure to file a civil action within a period of three months, the accused B. A Gamini is to be

declared entitled to the possession of the land in question.

Apparently, the said Heenbanda had instituted a partition action bearing no. 254456/P in

the District Court of Kegalle naming seven Defendants including the said B.A Gamini as the

7th Defendant.

After the conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge held that the said Heenbanda is

entitled to an undivided 12/120 share and the 7th Defendant the said B. A Gamini is entitled

to an undivided 30/120 share.

However, the said B. A Gamini, the 7th Defendant had appealed against the said judgment in

the said partition action to the Civil Appellate High Court of Kegalle. The impugned Judgment

of the District Judge was set aside by the Civil Appellate High Court on 15.02.2010, on the

basis that both the Plaintiff Heen Banda and the 7th Defendant B. A Gamini had not proved

their title to the disputed subject land. Nevertheless, Appellate court does not say that fact of

possession by 7th Defendant is wrong, but only states that title has not been proven.

Therefore, in view of the said Judgement of the District Judge with regard to possession of

the 7th Defendant (Appellant) should stand.

As such, it was the contention of the Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant that although the said

partition action was dismissed, it will not affect the decision made by the learned District

Judge that the 7th Defendant (Appellant) is in possession of the subject land.

In view of the observations of the learned District Judge in his Judgment, the 7th Defendant

(Appellant) was in possession from the time of institution of the partition action, which was

within a period of 3 months from 21.11.1990.

It is worth noting that the learned High Court Judge has stated in his order dated 18.01.2018,

bearing No. 14244,

According to the said journal entry is mentioned as A. Gamini and not Heenbanda. Thus,

it is seen that the learned Provincial High Court Judge had been confused and had thereby

misdirected himself and stated in his order dated 18.01.2018 that,

The said order further states that,

It was further stated that,

Nevertheless, according to the settlement dated 90.11.21 in criminal trespass case, it was

stated that.

.

Therefore, it clearly shows that the Learned Provincial High Court Judge has confused and

mixed up the accused and the Complainant of the aforesaid Magistrate court case.

As such, the learned Provincial High Court Judge had misdirected himself and stated in his

order that Respondent-Petitioners are entitled to the possession of the subject matter.

Page 8 of 10

Be that as it may, in terms of Section 68 (1) and 68 (3) of the Primary Court Procedure Act,

Court has to determine who was in possession of the disputed premises on the date of filing

of the information under section 66 of the Act, or if there is a dispossession, court has to

determine who was forcibly dispossessed within a period of two months immediately prior

to date of filing of the information.

It is significant to note that the Civil Appellate High Court dismissed the appeal of the

Appellant and dismissed the District Court action instituted by the said Heenbanda on

15.02.2010.

It is worthy to note that the said action was dismissed on the basis that parties have not proved

their title to the land sought to be partitioned. As such, the said dismissal would not affect the

decision made by the learned District Judge on 15.10.2010 with regard to the possession of

the 7th Defendant [Appellant].

It is relevant to note that according to the observations made by the learned District Judge in

his judgment, the 7th Defendant [Appellant] was in possession from the time of instituting the

impugned partition action which was within a period of 3 months from 21.11.1990.

Therefore, it is presumable that the Appellant, said B. A. Gamini was in possession of the

subject matter.

The Appellant, the 7th Defendant in the said partition action, had filed an information on

13.07.2010 action in terms of Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Court Procedure Act against

the Respondents namely Shelton, Chandrasekere and Nandasena, had entered the land on

04.07.2010 possessed by him and erected a fence and destroyed the cultivation when he was

away in Colombo.

Therefore, according to the Complaint of the Appellant the disturbance took place on

04.07.2010. It is to be noted that the said action was filed in the Primary Court of

Warakapola, just after 5 months from the Judgement of the Civil Appellate High Court in

case bearing No. CA/KAG/155/2007 (F).

However, the Respondents denied the said position of the Appellant and stated that they were

in possession of the land in dispute, and that they are the owners of the same.

Furthermore, the Respondents went on to state that they had been in possession of the

disputed land since 2003 and cultivated coconuts and bananas. The Respondents,

Page 9 of 10

produced affidavits marked as [D4-D8] from four persons to substantiate their contention.

It seems that, these affidavits were self-serving affidavits taken from people known to the

Respondents and it is observable that they were unable to produce any affidavits or

documents from Grama sevaka or any other officials to prove their possession by cogent

evidence. Similarly, no heavy reliance can be placed on the affidavit without the affirmants

being testified.

Furthermore, it is to be observed that the affirmants of these affidavits D4- D7 do not refer

to the date of disturbance on 04.07.2010 the date of the incident. Thus, these affidavits alone

could not be considered by the court to substantiate the possession of the Respondents with

regard to the relevant period material to the instant action.

However, the learned Magistrate accepted the version of the Appellant on the evidence placed

before him and issued an order under Part VII of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

It is seen that the learned Magistrate has come to the conclusion that according to the police

complaint marked as P7, the Appellant was dispossessed on 07.07.2010, and also in view of

the impugned partition action the Appellant was in possession for a long period of time. It is

imperative to note that in the said partition judgment possession of the 7th Defendant

(Appellant) was not set aside. Similarly, the said partition case does not say that the Plaintiff

Heenbanda was in possession of the subject land, but he was given the plantation in common

with other co-owners. As such, if the father Heenbanda did not have possession, it is

questionable as to how the children could get possession.

Therefore, in view of the foregoing reasons, it is imperative to note that the Respondents had

not established that they were in possession of the disputed portion of land and that they had

been dispossessed.

As such, the learned Provincial High Court Judge has misdirected himself and had come to

an erroneous conclusion that the Respondents were in possession of the disputed premises

during the relevant period of time and set aside the order of the learned Primary Court Judge,

which caused a great injustice to the Appellant in this matter.

Page 10 of 10

Therefore, we set aside the impugned order dated 18.01.2018 of the learned High Court

Judge and affirm the order of the learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court

Judge dated 01.12.2010.

Hence, we hold that the Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant is entitled to the possession of the

subject matter of the instant MC Case No. 58924/2010, and direct that the Petitioner-

Respondent-Appellant be restored to the possession of the disputed portion of land.

Hence the appeal is allowed.
