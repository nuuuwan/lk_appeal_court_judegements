This is a petition of revision and restitutio in integrum submitted before this

Court by the 14th, 15th, 16th and the 17th defendant- petitioners (hereinafter

referred to as the petitioners) pleading for an order to issue notices on the

respondents and to set aside the judgment/interlocutory decree dated

17.07.2006 and order dated 30.11.2022.

The facts of the case are as follows. The case at the District Court of

Bandarawela commenced in 1991 with the filing of a plaint where the land

in question (Getahewapathana alias Belipolawatta) was originally owned by

one R.M.Appuhami on a prescriptive title through the possession since 1940.

Subsequent to the filing of the plaint and the Preliminary Survey, the

statements of claims have been filed by the respective defendants. The

preliminary plan and report were submitted on 05.07.1993 by the Licensed

Surveyor P.W. Nandasena and it has been marked at the trial. Upon a

lengthy trial the judgment dated 17.06.2006 has been delivered by the

District Court of Bandarawela and the interlocutory decree entered

accordingly. The said judgment was challenged by filing an appeal to the

6

CA- RII-0007-23 Page 6 of 15 06/10/2023 IJ-31-23

Court of Appeal by the 5th, 10th, 11th, 13th 18th defendant- respondents, few

who are petitioners to the present application. Yet with the new amendment

for the relevant legislation the appeal was transferred to the Uva Provincial

Civil Appellate High Court.

The Appeal was dismissed by the learned Judges of the Uva Provincial Civil

Appellate High Court on 14.11.2014 along with a rectification of the error in

calculations made by the learned District Judge. Therefore, the learned

judges at the Uva Provincial Civil Appellate High Court have determined in

finality that the parties are entitled to the corpus in accordance with the

preliminary survey plan prepared by the Licensed Surveyor P.W. Nandasena.

Consequent to the judgment delivered by the Uva Provincial Civil Appellate

High Court the 5th, 11th, 13th 18th defendant-appellant-petitioners, few of

whom are petitioners to the instant application filed an application to the

Supreme Court by way of a revision where the decision of the Uva Provincial

Civil Appellate High Court was further affirmed and dismissed the revision

application.

Therefore, the original case was returned to the District Court of

Bandarawela on 24.08.2016. Thereafter the amended interlocutory decree

and commission was issued to the surveyor to prepare the final partition

scheme accordingly. On 03.10.2017 the final partition plan and report were

prepared and submitted by Licensed Surveyor S.P. Ratnayake which was

then objected by several parties including the petitioners.

A point of observation at this juncture is that as per Section 16 of the

Partition Act No. 21 of 1977, read together with Section 27 (3) denotes that

a commission issued under Subsection (2) of Section 27 must be issued to

the same surveyor who conducted the preliminary survey unless the Court

deems it necessary to appoint another commissioner of the court (surveyor),

which is to ensure that the issuance of the commission for the final scheme

is in accordance with law.

In the instant application the preliminary plan was prepared in the year

1993 by the Licensed Surveyor P.W. Nandasena. Upon his demise, through

a commission by courts the final survey has been prepared by the Licensed

Surveyor S.P. Rathnayake on 03.10.2017.

7

CA- RII-0007-23 Page 7 of 15 06/10/2023 IJ-31-23

However, due to the identification of a State-owned land in the corpus of

such final survey, learned Judge of the District Court of Bandarawela has

directed to issue a commission again after an inquiry, to have the final report

concluded by the court commissioner by the order dated 30.11.2022,

following the directives given therein. Several parties including the

petitioners did not accept the final partition Plan no 6146 and the report

submitted by Licensed Surveyor S. P. Rathnayake. Thereby upon the request

of the parties, a commission was issued to the Surveyor-General to obtain

an alternative final partition plan and report prior to the inquiry. Thus, it is

evident that in the matter at hand, the surveys have been conducted by

different surveyors due to the unavailability and demise of the original

surveyor who concluded the preliminary plan and the same is allowed by the

law enshrined in Section 27(3) of the Act.

It was revealed that the alternative final survey plan submitted by the

Surveyor-General (P1K) depicts an extent of 21 Acres, 1 Rood and 26.33

Perches inclusive of an extent of 2 Acres, 1 Rood and 4.34 Perches of State-

owned land. When the extent of State-owned land was deducted the privately

owned land amounts to 19 Acres, 0 Rood and 21.99 Perches. It is evident by

such calculations that the extent specified in the preliminary plan (P1C) of

the corpus prepared by P.W. Nandasena, which states 20 Acres, 2 Roods and

25 Perches has changed due to the importation of other plots of land as part

of the corpus. This has led to the major point of contention of this instant

matter which is that the extent of the corpus identified in the final survey

Plan No 6146 made by S.P.Ratnayake is different from that of the Preliminary

Plan No 353 made by P.W.Nandasena.

Nevertheless, in such circumstances, it is the duty of the trial judge to

ascertain whether the land in concern encompasses a state-owned land. And

if such concern arises the trial judge needs to take appropriate measures to

resolve the matter at any stage of the proceedings.

Therefore, the petitioner claims there is no possibility to partition the corpus

in accordance with the interlocutory decree (Marked as P1H) which is based

on the (Marked as P1F) judgment of the Uva Provincial Civil Appellant High

Court.

8

CA- RII-0007-23 Page 8 of 15 06/10/2023 IJ-31-23

The additional lot identified as lot 13X in P1M (F.V.P.-76) and P1N (Field Sheet

2 M 12/35) is a reservation and a public stream along the Alwathanne

Kadura.

Therefore, it cannot be privately owned as per the Section 52 of the State

Land Ordinance No. 8 of 1947. No person shall, by possession or user of any

State reservation after the commencement of this Ordinance, acquire any

prescriptive title to any such reservation against the State; and neither the

Prescription Ordinance nor any other law relating to the acquisition of rights

by virtue of possession or user shall apply to any such reservation after the

commencement of this Ordinance.

Similarly, as per Section 15 of the Prescription Ordinance it claims that no

part can claim prescriptive title over State-owned land.

Section 15 of the Prescription Ordinance reads as below:

Nothing herein contained shall in any way affect the rights of the State or

shall be taken to apply to any proceedings in any action for divorce, or to any

case in which special provision has been or may hereafter be made for

regulating and determining the period within which actions may be

commenced against any public officer or other person.

The identification of the corpus of a land is imperative in a partition action

for only after such concrete affirmation of the corpus, that a title of the

corpus could be determined. When several including the petitioners

requested to issue a commission to obtain an alternative final partition plan

the learned District Judge issued a commission on the Surveyor General as

per Section 18 3(a) of the act. Thereby the survey plan of the Surveyor-

General was submitted by 07.02.2019. Plaintiff 1st respondent along with

several others did not accept the plan by the Surveyor-General. An inquiry

was held and after calling evidence on the matter, the learned District Judge

through the order dated 30.11.2022 stated: the order made by the District

Judge of Bandarawela to issue a commission to the Superintendent of the

Survey of Badulla District is not lawful and there is no ground to consider plan

P1K and P1L and also has decided that the matters raised by the petitioners

based on P1K and P1L in the identification of the corpus and the title of the

9

CA- RII-0007-23 Page 9 of 15 06/10/2023 IJ-31-23

first owner as it has framed in the point of contest No 1 of Rathnayake

Mudiyanselage Appuhami being estopped

Being aggrieved by the order dated 30.11.2022, the petitioners filed this

revision and restitutio in integrum on the grounds that the corpus of the

plaint differs from that of the corpus marked in the preliminary plan and

that the corpus of the plan is erroneously named.

According to Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 (herein after referred to as the Act)

the Act sets clear guidelines and the procedure to follow from the

commencement of preliminary survey to the final partition decree.

As per Section 16, upon the issuing of summons to all defendants courts

shall issue a commission to the surveyor directing him to survey the land

and order him to return to his commission.

Upon the conclusion of trials of the partition action, the court shall

pronounce judgment in open courts and soon after, the courts shall enter

an interlocutory decree (Section 26) with the findings of the judgment which

directs the commissioner to conduct the final survey of the land.

According to Section 27 (3) when the courts decide the land shall be

partitioned, the courts will issue a commission to the surveyor who made

the preliminary survey unless the court through its discretion decides to

direct that the commission to be issued to another surveyor upon a

reasonable basis.

In the instant application, a concern has been raised on the legality of the

final partitioning and the commission report since it was conducted by

another surveyor. However, it is evident that the court had ordered the

commission to be issued to Licensed Surveyor S.P. Rathnayake after the

scheme inquiry. Subsequently, it was found S.P. Rathnayake is feeble and

therefore the court ordered to issue the commission to another licensed

survey commissioner. Nevertheless, I do not see any impropriety or illegality

in such an order.

When courts appoint a commissioner, he assumes the responsible position

of an officer in court. In Appuhamy v Weeratunge (1945) 46 N.L.R. 461 J

Soertsz A.C. states His functions are quasi-judicial, and he is expected to act

fairly and impartially.

10

CA- RII-0007-23 Page 10 of 15 06/10/2023 IJ-31-23

In Hendrick v Gimarahamine (1945) 47 N.L.R. 30 Soertsz A.C.J reiterated

that it is undesirable and indeed irregular to substitute another surveyor for

the commissioner appointed by court. It was also stated in the case where a

scheme of partition submitted by a surveyor is found to be better than that

submitted by a commissioner in the case. The proper course to adopt would

be to remit the scheme to the commissioner appointed by the courts, with a

direction to him to modify the scheme on the lines prepared by the surveyor.

Further, another concern was raised whether the Surveyor-General can be

directed to conduct the final survey and prepare the scheme. Since the Act

does not restrict the same, courts could direct the Surveyor-General to

conduct the abovementioned if the judge sees fit. However, this option

should not be exceedingly available as it could overburden the Surveyor-

Generals official tasks and open floodgates.

When the commission is issued under Section 27 it is the duty of the

surveyor to prepare the final scheme of partition in accordance with the

directions specified in the interlocutory decree. Further, he could include

other appropriate directions that need to be adhered to as deemed fit.

Nevertheless, the proposed scheme of partition needs to be justifiable and

reasonable to all interested parties.

As per Section 35, upon the surveyor's return to the commission, the courts

shall call the matter in open court and fix a date for the consideration of the

proposed scheme of partition. The date fixed shall not be earlier than thirty

days.

On the date fixed under Section 35 the parties could either admit the

proposed scheme of partition, accept the proposed scheme with

modifications or object to the proposed scheme of partition.

If any party objects to the proposed scheme of partition, the courts must

conduct a summary inquiry under Section 36(1) and thereafter confirm with

or without the modifications the proposed scheme of partition and enter final

decree of partition accordingly.

The inquiry conducted must be a brief examination which does not trail

longer than the trial already conducted. The inquiry does not require to

examine the pedigree, title, and other preliminary concerns in detail. And

11

CA- RII-0007-23 Page 11 of 15 06/10/2023 IJ-31-23

thus, should aim to ascertain the reasonableness, suitability and

practicability of the proposed partition and compensation scheme to all

parties of the matter. The inquiry must also determine whether the survey

has been conducted in accordance with the interlocutory decree and other

specified directions of the court.

Through the case Albert v Ratnayake (1988) 2 Sri L.R 246 in confirming

the scheme, it was noted that the expression modifications should not be

taken to mean only slight alterations. In an appropriate case a scheme with

substantial changes could be adopted. The trial judge may adapt the scheme

of partition prepared by the commissioner with changes in any manner

which he deems necessary.

With regard to the partition proposed by the commissioner, it has been

repeatedly held that a partition will not be rejected on light grounds or for

mere inequality of value of allotment, if in making it, the commissioner has

honestly exercised his judgement.

Under Section 33, the surveyor is required to partition the land so that each

party is entitled to compensation in respect of the improvements made to the

land, as far as is practicable. Thus, the scheme should aim to accommodate

any prior undisputed development or improvements in the land in the most

reconciling manner. If the proposed scheme directs any compensation to be

paid to a party, the value estimated must be in accordance with the present

value and not the value at the time of the preliminary survey. Section 33

further states that The surveyor shall so partition the land that each party

entitled to compensation in respect of improvements effected thereto or of

buildings erected thereon will, if that party is entitled to a share of the soil, be

allotted, so far as is practicable, that portion of the land which has been so

improved or built upon, as the case may be. Section 34 describes the way of

paying compensation and owelty as thus (1) Where under any scheme of

partition prepared by a surveyor, payment has to be made to or by any party

to a partition action in respect of compensation for improvements to the land

or of owelty, the amount of such payment shall, in the first instance, be

assessed by the surveyor and shall be finally determined by the court.(2) The

amount determined by the court, under subsection (1) of this section or under

subsection (4) of section 26, as compensation for improvements or as owelty

shall, from the date on which final decree is entered, be a charge on the portion

12

CA- RII-0007-23 Page 12 of 15 06/10/2023 IJ-31-23

of the land or the extent of land finally allotted to the party made liable for the

payment of such compensation or owelty, as the case may be. It is clear that

such payments should be finally determined by the court.

In Narayanan Chettiar v Kaliappa Chettiar (1945) 47 N.L.R. 77 Lord

Thankerton, delivering the opinion of the Privy Council, stated that in an

action for the partition of an estate carrying tea on it, a commissioner can,

in fixing his valuation, take in to account the effect of the tea restrictions

which were in operation. The principle acted upon by the judicial committee

was that the allocation of lots in a partition action was similar to the

distribution of assets among partners.

During the preparation of a final plan for a Partition case, strict adherence

to the interlocutory decree and any explicit directives outlined in the

surveyor's commission is obligatory. The Court commissioner is precluded

from exercising independent discretion and is bound to comply with the

interlocutory decree and the specific directives issued by the Court. The final

plan must be founded upon a preliminary plan which has already been

marked and accepted in the interlocutory decree. It is not permitted to

introduce additional portions of land into the corpus during the final plan

preparation process.

After the final partition scheme is prepared along with the modifications it

would be most appropriate to allow the parties to re-consider the proposed

final scheme prepared and thereafter the court could enter the final partition

decree.

Nevertheless, as per Section 36A any party dissatisfied with any order made

under Section 36 may prefer and appeal against such order.

A noteworthy prominence should also be given to the fact that the Land

Reform Commission actively taking part as the 19th Defendant in the trial

conducted and for raising issues. Nevertheless, though the Land Reform

Commission made claims they were dismissed in the proceedings. And there

is no evidence that the Commission has filed any appeal/revision application

against the judgment/interlocutory decree entered.

Furthermore, this court notes an ambiguity in the caption with regard to

naming the Land Reform Commission as party to this instant application.

13

CA- RII-0007-23 Page 13 of 15 06/10/2023 IJ-31-23

Firstly, it is evident that the commission was named as the 19th Defendant

in the District Court proceedings and in the current application the

commission is identified as the 19th Defendant/ 18th Respondent.

The initial matter of concern dates to over thirty years, the plaint for the

partition was filed at the District Court of Bandarawela in February 1991,

the interlocutory decree was entered in June 2006, an appeal was made to

the Uva Provincial Civil Appellate High Court and the same was dismissed

in 2014 subject to few rectifications, later the parties sort a revision at the

Supreme Court against the order of the Civil Appellate judgment yet the

matter was dismissed. Thereby it is quite evident that the matter has been

trailing for generations, well over thirty years and thus it is the view of this

court that at least the present generation should be allowed to enjoy the

fruits of the victory.

As observed by Soertsz A.C.J in Appuhamy v Weeratunge (Supra) There

must be an end to a case, particularly to a partition case which is generally of

a protracted nature and which prevents parties to it from dealing with the land

as freely as they would wish to in the interval.

Order dated 30.11.2022 had been attained after conducting a summary

inquiry as per Section 36(1), thereby it can be ascertained that the order

under the final partition scheme is correct.

The learned District Court Judges findings with respect to the Surveyor

Generals proposed plan and report are not correct. Thereby, this Court

further directs and emphasizes that when the final commission is conducted

by the Licensed Surveyor (the Court Commissioner), should consider the

observations made by the Surveyor-General in P1K and P1L along with the

other directives specified by the learned District Judge after the scheme

inquiry in the order dated 30.11.2022.

After the final partition scheme is prepared as stated above along with the

modifications, an opportunity should be given to all parties to consider such

a modified final scheme before the confirmation and entering of the final

decree.

In light of this contention, any party to the application could resort to the

remedy provided by the provisions of the Partition Act No.21 of 1977, where

14

CA- RII-0007-23 Page 14 of 15 06/10/2023 IJ-31-23

under Section 36A any person dissatisfied with an order of the court, may

prefer an appeal of such order to the Court of Appeal. Section 35 of the

Partition Law promulgates the procedure for the court to consider the survey

issued by the surveyor in open court. The courts after conducting the

summary inquiry would either affirm or disaffirm the scheme of partition

proposed by the surveyor. Subsequently, any party dissatisfied by such

determination of the court, the law provides the remedy for the appeal of

such order as reiterated above.

The interlocutory order dated 17.07.2006 was challenged through an appeal

to the Uva Provincial Civil Appellate High Court. The civil appellate court

affirmed the order of the learned District Court Judge subject to a few

modifications. Later the same was challenged through a revision application

at the Supreme Court where the order of the civil appellate court was

reaffirmed.

In the case CA/RI/15/2018 decided on 02/11/2018, Samayawardhena. J

stated, I must state that there is no magic in the word restitution, as that

relief, in my view, can also be sought in a revision application. Although, in

law, revision and restitution in integrum are two different applications, in

practice, they go hand in hand, and almost all the time, are sought in

combination.

Thereby, this court believes there is no standing to interfere with the said

judgment /interlocutory entered, (subject to the modifications entered by

Provincial Civil Appellate Courts) at this stage, as it has already been

reaffirmed by the Supreme Court.

In light of the aforementioned changes, this Court affirms the order dated

30.11.2022, as the final and appropriate conclusion reached by the learned

District Judge. The Court has thoroughly considered the matter and finds

no valid reasons to issue formal notices to the respondents. Therefore, the

Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this order to the District

Judge of Bandarawela to conclude the matter expeditiously, as directed, and

enter the final decree.

Furthermore, it is important to note that over thirty years have passed since

the institution of this case, and the Supreme Court has already upheld the

judgment made by the learned Judges of the Provincial Civil Appellate Court

15

CA- RII-0007-23 Page 15 of 15 06/10/2023 IJ-31-23

during the revision application process. At least, the succeeding generation

of the original parties of the subject matter should now be allowed to fully

enjoy the benefits of their victory.

Notice refused. Application dismissed without costs.
