Written submission tendered on: 17.01.2023 by the Appellant.

18.01.2023 by the Respondent.

Decided on: 31.03.2023

This case came up for argument with case Nos. Tax 07/2013, Tax 09/2013 and

Tax 33/2014.

This case and Tax 22/2014 were not argued. The judgment in Tax 07/2013 was

given by this Court on 16.03.2022. The judgment in Tax 09/2013 was given by

this Court on 09.12.2022.

The Questions of Law raised in this case are,

(1) Is the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission time barred in terms

of section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act No. 23 of 2011 as it was

made after 270 days from the date of commencement of its sittings for the

hearing of appeal?

(2) (a) Whether the phrase industrial and machine tool manufacturing

appearing in section 17 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 can be

interpreted to the effect industrial manufacturing and machine tool

manufacturing?

(2)(b) Whether the Tax Appeals Commission has erred in law in

interpreting section 17(2) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006?

(3) Can the interpretation of industrial manufacturing as determined by

the Tax Appeals Commission be rejected on the ground that the phrase

industrial manufacturing has a very wide connotation?

(4) Whether the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission is erroneous

as they misunderstood the main question, i.e., instead of the question whether

the activity of the company falls within the meaning of industrial

manufacturing, the Tax Appeals Commission determined the question whether

the product viz., Fire Guard Table falls within the meaning of tool?

(5) Whether the failure to determine the question by the Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue and by the Tax Appeals Commission that the Assessor

has communicated his conclusion instead of the reason required under section

163(3) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 tantamount to the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue and the Tax Appeals Commission

accepting the appeal?

In Tax 07/2013 the appellant was ACL Cables PLC. In Tax 09/2013 the appellant

was ACL Polymers (Pvt) Limited. In this case the appellant is ACL Cables PLC.

Oral submissions referred to in this judgment are those that were made in

relation to case Nos. Tax 07/2013 and Tax 09/2013.

In respect of Question No. 01, the Tax Appeals Commission is required to

determine an appeal within 270 days from the commencement of sittings for

hearing of such appeal. The Commission has commenced its sittings in respect

of this case on 26.06.2018. The determination is dated 11.06.2019. However the

appellant is not pursuing on this question.

Section 17 of Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 reads, as follows,

Question of law No. 02 (a) is,

Whether the phrase industrial and machine tool manufacturing

appearing in section 17 of the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 can be

interpreted as industrial manufacturing and machine tool

manufacturing ?

4 | C a s e N o . T a x 2 8 2 0 1 9 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 . 0 3 . 2 0 2 3

In regard to this question, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant has

argued in oral submissions that, an industrial tool does not mean only a

screwdriver or a wrench, etc., but it includes cables. Certain notes from the

internet have been produced to show that cables and wires are also classified as

tools.

The learned Presidents Counsel who appeared for the respondent has argued in

his oral submissions that the aforesaid position of the appellant regarding an

industrial tool, is not what is in the case stated.

This appears to be correct because question of law No. 02 (a) attempts to

interpret the phrase industrial and machine tool manufacturing as industrial

manufacturing and machine tool manufacturing.

The plain reading of the phrase shows that it means, industrial tool

manufacturing and machine tool manufacturing.

Section 17 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 reads thus,

17(1) The profits and income within the meaning of paragraph (1) of

section 3 (other than any profits and income from the sale of capital assets)

of any company from any specified undertaking referred to in subsection

(2) and carried on by such company after 01st April 2002, shall be exempt

from income tax for a period of five years reckoned from the

commencement of the year of assessment in which the undertaking

commences to make profits or any year of assessment not later than two

years reckoned from the date on which the undertaking commences to

carry on commercial operations whichever is earlier.

(2) For the purpose of sub section (1) specified undertaking means

5 | C a s e N o . T a x 2 8 2 0 1 9 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 . 0 3 . 2 0 2 3

(a) An undertaking carried on by a company-

(i)incorporated before 01st April 2002, with a minimum

investment of rupees fifty million invested in such

undertaking; or

(ii) incorporated with a minimum investment of rupees ten

million invested in such undertaking,

and which is engaged in agriculture, agro processing, industrial

and machine tool manufacturing, machinery manufacturing,

electronics, export of non traditional products, or information technology

and allied services.

Even the Tax Appeal Commission has decided this question in the same way. It

says in its determination,

It is to be noted that in section 17(2)(a)(ii) even though some terms such

as agriculture, agro processing, non traditional products and

deemed export are defined, the phrase industrial and machine tool

manufacturing is not defined. Therefore it is necessary to look for a

meaning to be attributed to this phrase industrial and machine tool

manufacturing. It would appear that in the phrase industrial and

machine tool manufacturing the main item referred to is the term tool

and the words tool manufacturing is qualified by the words industrial

and machine. Therefore in this phrase industrial and machine tool

manufacturing the term tool can be understood to mean either an

industrial tool or a machine tool.

6 | C a s e N o . T a x 2 8 2 0 1 9 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 . 0 3 . 2 0 2 3

But having correctly understood the question, the Tax Appeal Commission erred

in looking at the meaning of the term tool in dictionaries whereas it should

have considered the meaning of the phrase industrial tool manufacturing.

It considered the meaning of the term tool in the Oxford Dictionary, which it

gave as an instrument such as a hammer, screw driver, saw, etc., that you hold

in your hand and use for making things, repairing things, etc. garden tools,

cutting tools or power tools (using electricity).

Hence it concluded at page 10 of its determination,

However, fire guard cable is only a wire with an improved capability

used in the construction of buildings, houses, for the purpose of

transmitting electrical current or used for telecommunication

signals..The important difference is that the fire guard cables once

used in buildings or houses it remains embedded in the building or in the

house permanently.

But this would not have happened had the Tax Appeal Commission considered

the meaning of the phrase industrial tool manufacturing, which shows that

fire guard cables are such tools. All tools, especially industrial tools need not

be hand held tools in the popular meaning, as the Tax Appeal Commission said.

The Tax Appeal Commission said, In this regard, it is a very useful rule in the

interpretation of a statute, to adhere to the ordinary meaning of the word used

and to the grammatical construction, unless that is at variance with the

intention of the legislature, to be derived from the statute itself.

Here using the word in its ordinary meaning was in variance with the intention

of the legislature, which was to be derived from the statute itself, because the

7 | C a s e N o . T a x 2 8 2 0 1 9 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 . 0 3 . 2 0 2 3

term used was not tool as the Tax Appeal Commission thought but industrial

tool manufacturing.

The use of the prefix industrial before the term tool manufacturing alters its

ordinary meaning.

Therefore it is clear that the appellant is entitled to the exemption from tax

because it is engaged in industrial tool manufacturing which is a specified

undertaking.

However, the question of law No. 03 is not correctly formulated, in the sense, it

should have referred not to industrial manufacturing, but to industrial tool

manufacturing. Hence while the said question of law has to be answered in the

negative, the answer must accompany with an explanation that the term

industrial and machine tool manufacturing can be interpreted as industrial

tool manufacturing and machine tool manufacturing, in which the appellants

product comes within the former.

The question of law No. 03 is,

Can the interpretation of industrial manufacturing as determined by the

Tax Appeals Commission be rejected on the ground that it has a very wide

connotation?

But it would appear that now this question will not arise because the answer to

question of law No. 02 (a) is not that it is industrial manufacturing but

industrial tool manufacturing.

Hence this question has to be answered as Does not arise, in view of the answer

given to question of law No. 02 (a).

Questions of Law Nos. 02 (b) and (4) are similar in import. They question whether

the Tax Appeals Commission erred, that instead of the question whether the

activity of the appellant falls within the meaning of industrial manufacturing,

the Tax Appeals Commission determined the question whether the product viz.,

Fire Guard Cables falls within the meaning of tool. This has been decided in

the present case as well as in Case No. Tax 07/2013 and Case No. Tax 09/2013.

In respect of Question No. 05, that the assessor has communicated his

conclusion instead of reasons required under section 163(3) of Inland Revenue

Act No. 10 of 2006, this Court wishes to observe the following.

The same principal adopted in Ismail vs. Commissioner of Income Tax and

D.M.S. Fernando vs. Mohideen Ismail, that assessment becomes valid only

when statutory notice of assessment is given, was followed in the Indian Case

of The Secretary of State for India in Council vs. Seth Khemchand Thaoomal

and others, 1923 decided in the Court of the Judicial Commissioner, Sind,

Reports of Income Tax cases, Vol. I (1886-1925) printed at the Madras Law

Journal press, Maylapore, Madras, 1926. (A copy of the said judgment is

attached to the present judgment)

The summary of the case said,

Where the notice of demand in respect of an assessment to super tax

for the year 1918-1919 was served on the assessee in May 1919 after the

expiry of the year charged for and the assessee instituted a suit to recover

the tax collected from him on the ground that the assessment was illegal:

Held, that there was no charge, recovery or payment of super tax within

the year of assessment as laid down by section 03 of the Super tax Act and

consequently there being no assessment under the Act, section 39 of the

Income Tax Act was no bar to the suit. (page 26)

Except for the name super tax in the said kind of tax involved, there is no

difference in the principal applicable.

9 | C a s e N o . T a x 2 8 2 0 1 9 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 . 0 3 . 2 0 2 3

The court said,

The main point for consideration is whether the assessment of super

tax was an assessment under the Act, for it is only in that event the

jurisdiction of the civil court is barred..(page 27)

As observed in Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 04th Edition

page 429 : Statutes which impose pecuniary burden are subject to the rule

of strict construction. It is a well settled rule of law that all charges upon

the subject must be imposed by clear and unambiguous language,

because in some degree they operate as penalties..(page 27)

Section 06 of Act VIII of 1917 provided that when in the collectors opinion

a person is chargeable with super tax a notice shall be served upon him

calling upon him to pay the amount specified therein or to apply to have

the assessment reduced or cancelled. The only way that an assessee

could be said to be charged is by a demand notice issued by the

income tax officials, for till then it cannot be argued that he has been

charged with the payment of any tax. But the respondents admittedly

received notice of demand only in May 1919, that is after the year 1918-

1919 was over and even if he was chargeable with super tax he ceased to

be so after the expiry of the year. The demand notice, therefore, having

been issued after the year was over, there was neither payment nor

recovery of the super tax within the year 1918-1919. (page 27)

The lucidity in the aforequoted passage is characteristic of the age in which

it was written. The tax payer could have instituted a suit and recovered the

tax paid because there was no assessment. There was no assessment

because there was no notice, a demand, a charge, within the limited period.

This shows that an assessment becomes a valid assessment only when

notice of assessment is given. For the application of the time limit what

must be there is a valid assessment. Such an assessment cannot come into

being without there being notice of assessment.

10 | C a s e N o . T a x 2 8 2 0 1 9 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 . 0 3 . 2 0 2 3

The court further said,

Mr. Elphinston [who appeared for the state] attempted to invoke the aid

of a confidential note dated the 23rd March 1919 wherein the Mukhtiarkar

had made the calculation of the assessment and as this was done before

the expiry of the year, he argued that the tax was charged within the year.

This argument has no substance in it. It is unarguable that the contents

of a confidential document were communicated to the assessee, nor

is it even alleged that the latter was aware before the end of the year

that he was chargeable with any super tax. (page 27)

Similarly, the argument for the respondent in the present case that when the

assessment is made it is an assessment for the purposes of the time limit and

there is no time period within which notice of assessment must be given, cannot

succeed.

The court also said,

Mr. Elphinston pressed upon us the serious prejudice to the Crown, if

section 03 were interpreted literally but in a fiscal statute we must look to

the letter of the law and cannot introduce equitable considerations. (page

27)

There is a patent error of law in the assessment of the super tax and

therefore, the assessment was not one under the Act ; the suit therefore is

not barred. (page 27)

Hence the court considered the failure to give notice of assessment as a

patent error in the assessment which makes the assessment invalid.

It further shows that when notice of assessment is not given within the time

limit, the tax payer obtains a vested right not to be taxed, the reason why in that

case he was able to successfully sue for tax illegally paid.

11 | C a s e N o . T a x 2 8 2 0 1 9 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 . 0 3 . 2 0 2 3

The position therefore is that in the present case this tantamount to the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue and the Tax Appeals Commission

accepting the appeal for both the years of assessment in question. Hence

question of law No. 05 has to be answered in favour of the appellant.

Hence Questions of Law are answered as follows,

(1) Is the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission time barred in terms

of section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act No. 23 of 2011 as it was

made after 270 days from the date of commencement of its sittings for the

hearing of appeal?

Not pursued.

(2) (a) Whether the phrase industrial and machine tool manufacturing

appearing in section 17 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 can be

interpreted to the effect industrial manufacturing and machine tool

manufacturing?

No. It has to be interpreted as industrial tool manufacturing and machine

tool manufacturing. The appellants product comes within the former.

(2)(b) Whether the Tax Appeals Commission has erred in law in

interpreting section 17(2) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006?

Yes.

(3) Can the interpretation of industrial manufacturing as determined by

the Tax Appeals Commission be rejected on the ground that the phrase

industrial manufacturing has a very wide connotation?

This question does not arise in view of the answer given to question of law No.

02 (a).

(4) Whether the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission is erroneous as

they misunderstood the main question, i.e., instead of the question whether the

12 | C a s e N o . T a x 2 8 2 0 1 9 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 . 0 3 . 2 0 2 3

activity of the company falls within the meaning of industrial manufacturing,

the Tax Appeals Commission determined the question whether the product viz.,

Fire Guard Table falls within the meaning of tool?

Yes.

(5) Whether the failure to determine the question by the Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue and by the Tax Appeals Commission that the Assessor

has communicated his conclusion instead of the reason required under section

163(3) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 tantamount to the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue and the Tax Appeals Commission

accepting the appeal?

Yes.

Hence the appeal in the form of a Case Stated is allowed.

There is no order on costs.
