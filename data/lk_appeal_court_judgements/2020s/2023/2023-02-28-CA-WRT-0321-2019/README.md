The precursory facts to the Application pursued are as follows.

Page 5 of 13

At the very outset, the Petitioner, claims to have been prejudiced by

the decision to transfer part of the stipulated land (25.22 perches out

of 31.5 perches marked P3, P4) by the 1st Respondent, National

Housing Development Authority, to the 7th Respondent National

Association of All Ceylon Driving School Owners. The said land was

purportedly enjoyed by the Petitioner for more than 18 years and was

allegedly purchased by the Petitioners father. However, no

documented evidence of such a purchase has been averred by the

Petitioner and as per paragraph 6 of the Petition, it is admitted by

the Petitioner that the land was purchased by way of an informal

agreement. The subject land of the matter at hand belongs to the 1st

Respondent which was used to construct a housing scheme known

as Katharagama Rajamawatha Housing Scheme. The 1st

Respondent built 35 houses out of the 41 plots of land, to which the

Petitioner avers that he enjoyed 31.5 perches out of the remainder

bare land (P1, P2). The Petitioner who is in occupancy of the land

from the year 2000 onwards claims that he made a request for water

and electricity connections which were denied as it was claimed that

the Petitioner was an unauthorized occupant.

As the Petitioner was in unauthorized occupation of the said land,

the 1st Respondent, in order to eject the Petitioner filed action under

the State Land Recovery of Possession Act, No.7 of 1979 in the

Magistrate Courts of Tissamaharama in case bearing no:57927 (1R3).

On 27.09.2019, the learned Magistrate of Tissamaharama delivered

the Order to eject the Petitioner as he is in unauthorized occupation

of the land in dispute. Being aggrieved by the said Order the

Petitioner preferred an appeal to the Provincial High Court of

Hambanthota which was dismissed and thereafter the appeal lodged

by the Petitioner in the Court of Appeal was also dismissed. In this

Page 6 of 13

scenario it is well established that the Petitioner is in unauthorized

occupation of the land in suit. At this juncture it is pertinent to note

that the petitioner has deliberately suppressed the above material

facts to this Court.

In lieu of this, the Petitioner made multiple requests to be included

in the Legalization of Squatters Program. Heeding to such a request,

the 1st Respondent offered the Petitioner the option of purchasing 6

purchases out of the occupied land of 31.5 Perches for the purchase

price of rupees 600,000/=. The Petitioner in denouncing such an

offer, states that he has been singled out and prejudiced as, whilst

he is being charged at rupees 100,000/= a perch, other land

occupants have been given the land for at a much lower rate (P66,

P67, P68)

On 21.05.2019, a group of persons, agents of the 7th Respondent,

occupied the land the Petitioner claims ownership to and attempted

to erect a boundary fence reserving a larger part of the land. Upon

inquiry by the Petitioner as to why they were erecting a boundary

wall, it was stated by the agents of the 7th Respondent that they are

doing so as they have purchased the land. In response to this the

Petitioner filed a complaint with the Katharagama Police Station after

informing the A.S.P (P153). It is averred by the Petitioner that he was

unaware of such a transfer until the agents of the 7th Respondent

entered the land. It is averred that the said transfer without being

communicated to him is fraudulent, arbitrary and amounts to ultra

vires. It is also stated that the Petitioner has a Legitimate Expectation

to receive the land after being entered into the legalization of

squatters program.

Page 7 of 13

In view of the above facts, the Respondents submits that the land

which the Petitioner has occupied has been done so on an

unauthorized basis. Further, as the Petitioner was not considered to

be a low-income earner the land has to be disposed to the Petitioner

by charging the value of the land, thus the 6 perches was valued at

rupees 600,000/= by the Valuation Department (1R4, 1R5, 1R6).

Thus, as per Circular No 2014/01 the Petitioner is only entitled to

obtain 6 perches from the land in question. In response to the

averments that the transfer was made without being communicated

to the Petitioner is fraudulent, arbitrary and amounts to ultra vires,

it is argued by the Respondents that the Board of Directors of the 1st

Respondent approved the decision to dispose 25.22 perches of the

said land to the 7th Respondent with approval of the subject Minister.

Once the due payments were settled by the 7th Respondent, the said

portion of land was disposed (1R15). Thus, the reasoning set out for

such a transfer has been provided for by the Deputy Chairman of the

1st Respondent Committee as being that, post a meeting with H. E.

the President, it was directed that such land should not be disposed

other than for the wellbeing of the pilgrims who visit Katharagama,

thus as a result this land has been transferred to the 7th Respondent

to provide accommodation to devotees who visit Katharagama

(1R23).

Taking cognizance to the above facts, this Court views that as the

land in question is State land the discretion of transferring the land

rests within State with adherence to circumstantial facts, and

circulars, legislations and direction by the State. In view of such, the

said land was transferred to the 7th Respondent in line with the view

of H. E. The President, who post a meeting directed that such bare

lands should not be disposed other than for the wellbeing of the

Page 8 of 13

pilgrims who visit Katharagama. Thus, the land was transferred to

the 7th Respondent for the purpose of providing accommodation to

pilgrims. This necessity emanates from the objectives provided for in

Section 4(h) and 4(i) of the National Housing Development Authority

Act, No. 17 of 1979 which reads as follows

4. The objects of the Authority shall Up-

(a) to directly engage itself in the construction of flats, houses and

other living accommodation or buildings;

(b) to formulate schemes to establish housing development

projects in order to alleviate the housing shortage;

(c) to cause the clearance of slum and shanty areas and the re-

development of such areas;

(d) to promote housing development;

(e) to develop or re-develop land for the carrying out of any of the

objects of the Authority;

(f) to make land available to any person for housing development;

(g) to provide financial or other assistance to persons engaged in

any activity which is similar to any of the objects of the Authority;

(h) to conduct, promote and co-ordinate activities in relation to all

aspects of housing development; and

(i) to do all such other acts as may be necessary or conducive to

the attainment of any or all of the above objects.

Thereby, it is in the best interest of the State that the said land being

transferred to the 7th Respondent would be in line with the provisions

Page 9 of 13

of the National Housing Development Authority Act, No. 17 of 1979

in order to attain the said policy objectives. Thereby, I am of the view

that the Respondent Committee has taken appropriate steps to make

such a transfer within the 4 corners of the legal sphere and has not

done so capriciously. Further, the 1st Respondent Committee has not

acted in a manner thats arbitrary, unpredictable, or whimsical, that

is not based on reason, evidence, or established legal standards. A

decision or action that is deemed to be capricious is one that is made

without proper consideration of relevant facts or without a rational

basis, the Respondent Committee has not acted such, as they have

taken cognizance to the fact that the transfer of the land to the 7th

Respondent was done so to further the policy objectives.

Furthermore, it is undisputed that the Petitioner is deemed an un

authorized occupant by an Order dictated by the Magistrate of

Tissamaharama on 27.09.2019 in case bearing No. 57297 which

directs the Petitioner to be evicted from the land as per the provisions

of the Sate Land (Recovery of Possession) Act, No 7 of 1979 (1R3).

Thus, it is clear to this Court that despite an ejectment Order by the

Magistrate of Tissamaharama, the Petitioner is still in occupation of

the said land without removing himself. Despite such an eviction

Order he is seeking redress from this Court, thus going against the

clean hands doctrine where the Applicant must seek the assistance

of Court with clean hands. Here the Petitioner has not done so, he

has come to seek relief from this Court with knowledge that he is an

unauthorized occupier in line with an eviction Order by the Learned

Magistrate.

The doctrine of clean hands is a legal principle that has long been

recognized in common law jurisdictions, including in administrative

law. The doctrine is premised on the idea that a person who seeks

Page 10 of 13

the aid of the Court must have clean hands, meaning that they must

not have engaged in any wrongful or illegal conduct themselves.

The doctrine of clean hands has its roots in equity, a branch of

common law that seeks to prevent unfairness or injustice. The

doctrine of clean hands was one of the principles of equity that

evolved over time. It was based on the maxim he who comes into

equity must come with clean hands. The maxim is premised on the

idea that a person who seeks the aid of the Court must not have

engaged in any wrongful conduct that would disqualify them from

receiving relief.

The application of the principle has been extrapolated into the Sri

Lankan legal sphere through cases such as Gamini Dissanayake v.

M. C. M. Kaleel and Others1 where eight members of a political party

were expelled froth the party for signing an impeachment motion

against the President who was their party leader, without a hearing.

The decision was challenged. The Supreme Court held that two out

of the eight Members of the Parliament who were Cabinet Ministers

were guilty of unmeritorious conduct for violating the principle of

collective responsibility and therefore were disentitled from obtaining

relief due to the lack of clean hands.

Per Fernando J. : It is within the discretion of the Court where

to grant him such a remedy or not. He may be debarred from

relief if he has acquiesced in the invalidity or has waived it. If he

has not come with due diligence and ask for it to be set aside, he

may be sent away with nothing.

1 1993 2SLR 135

Page 11 of 13

Further, in Borella Private Hospital v. Bandaranayake and Two

Others2, K. Sripavan J. observed that, the writ of certiorari and

mandamus being discretionary remedies will not be granted where

the party applying lacks uberrima fide.

Thereby as per the above observations, it is evident that the Petitioner

by failing to take cognizance to the fact that he is an illegal squatter

that has been served a notice of eviction cannot deem himself to have

clean hands before this Court.

Returning to the previous observation on suppression of material

facts, it is clear that the Petitioner has suppressed the fact that there

was an Order given by the learned Magistrate of Tissamaharama

against the Petitioner for his eviction. I view that this is a salient

material fact for the Application at hand, that has been deliberately

omitted by the Petitioner. Suppression of material facts to the Court

refers to intentionally withholding or concealing information that is

crucial or relevant to a legal proceeding. In legal terms, material facts

are those that are relevant and significant to a case and would

influence a reasonable person's decision.

It is trite law that discretionary relief will be refused by Court without

going into the merits if there has been suppression and/or

misrepresentation of material facts. It is necessary in this context to

refer to the following passage from the judgment of Pathirana J in

W. S. Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi3

"The necessity of a full and fair disclosure of all the material

facts to be placed before the Court when, an application for a writ

or injunction, is made and the process of the Court is invoked is

2 2005 (1) Appellate Law Recorder 27 3 1973 [77 N.L.R. 131 at 135,6]

Page 12 of 13

laid down in the case of the King v. The General Commissioner

for the Purpose of the Income Tax Acts for the District of

Kensington-Ex-parte Princess Edmorbd de Poigns Although this

case deals with a writ of prohibition the principles enunciated are

applicable to all cases of writs or injunctions. In this case a

Divisional Court without dealing with the merits of the case

discharged the rule on the ground that the applicant had

suppressed or misrepresented the facts material to her

application. The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the

Divisional Court that there had been a suppression of material

facts by the applicant in her affidavit and therefore it was

justified in refusing a writ of prohibition without going into the

merits of the case. In other words, so rigorous is the necessity for

a full and truthful disclosure of all material facts that the Court

would not go into the merits of the application, but will dismiss it

without further examination".

And further, Siva Selliah Js view in Sarath Hulangamuwa v.

Siriwardena4

A petitioner who seeks relief by writ which is an extraordinary

remedy must in fairness to this Court, bare every material fact so

that the discretion of this Court is not wrongly invoked or

exercised. In the instant case, the fact that the petitioner had a

residence at Dehiwala is indeed a material fact which has an

important bearing on the question of the genuineness of the

residence of the petitioner at the annexe and on whether this

Court should exercise its discretion to quash the order

4 (1986) 1 SLR 275

Page 13 of 13

complained of as unjust and discriminatory. On this ground to

the application must be dismissed for lack of uberrima fides.

Taking into consideration all the above, it is my view that the said

transfer by the 1st Respondent has been done bona fide in order to

further the policy objectives of the National Housing Development

Authority Act, No. 17 of 1979. Furthermore, a remedy by way of Writs

cannot be granted to the Petitioner due to the breach of the clean

hands doctrine in tandem with suppression of material facts.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Application made by the

Petitioner is liable to be dismissed. Thus, the Application is

dismissed. Taking cognizance to the facts and circumstances of the

Application this Court is of the view that the Application should be

dismissed with cost fixed at Rupees 75,000 payable by the Petitioner

to the 1st Respondent.

Application dismissed.
