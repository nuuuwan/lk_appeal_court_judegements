Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

When the instant Application was supported in open court on 29.07.2022, the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner at the outset informed Court that the Petitioner would confine his

case only to the relief prayed for in paragraph 'C' of the prayer of the Petition. Accordingly,

this Court needs to consider only whether the Petitioner is entitled to a mandate in the nature

of a writ of Certiorari quashing the decision reflected in the letter dated 06.10.2021 marked

'P19'.

The said P19 is a letter issued by the Acting General Manager of the State Mortgage and

Investment Bank ('SMIB') expressing his view of commencing a fresh disciplinary inquiry

against the Petitioner. Originally, the Petitioner was subjected to a disciplinary inquiry

following the service of the charge sheet dated 20.11.2017, marked 'P4'. The charges against

the Petitioner were based on the alleged misconduct or negligence in approving a personal

loan for a sum of Rupees Forty Million Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Thousand

(Rs.40,365,000.00) while serving as an Assistant General Manager of SMIB. The Inquiry

Page 4 of 9

Officer expressed an opinion referring to the evidence led before him that the charges 1 to 12

against the Petitioner have not been proved. Having analyzed the final report of the said

disciplinary inquiry held against the Petitioner, the Disciplinary Authority of the SMIB

decided to disagree with the decision of the said Inquiry Officer. Accordingly, the Acting

General Manager of the SMIB by the said letter marked 'P19' informed the Petitioner that a

fresh disciplinary inquiry would be commenced against the Petitioner on the same charges. It

is noted that the said Acting General Manager has not accepted the final decision of the

previous disciplinary inquiry based on clause 16.3 of the Disciplinary Rules ('Rules') marked

'P27'/ 'R3' of the SMIB.

The Petitioner claims that even though the previous disciplinary inquiry against him was

concluded on 18.12.2019 the Disciplinary Authority of the SMIB failed to communicate its

final decision to him. Anyhow, as per the cover letter marked 'R7' the Inquiry Officer has

forwarded his Final Report ('R7(a)') to SMIB only on 30.10.2020. It is seen that the Petitioner

has been given extensions of service from time to time until the conclusion of the said

disciplinary inquiry (Vide 'R6' and 'R6(a)'). Moreover, the Petitioner states that he retired on

15.12.2020 reaching the retirement age of sixty years but it appears that it occurred whilst the

said disciplinary inquiry was in progress. Meanwhile, SMIB notified the Petitioner through a

letter dated 23.02.2022 ('P22') of the new Inquiry Officer and the Prosecution Officer for a

fresh disciplinary inquiry which was scheduled to commence on 01.04.2022.

The Petitioner pleads that the decision to hold a fresh disciplinary inquiry against him is

contrary to the provisions stipulated in Clauses 16.3 and 16.4 of the said Rules. The

contention of the Petitioner is that such a decision has been taken in a scenario where the final

decision of the first disciplinary inquiry against the Petitioner was pending for approximately

two years. Additionally, the Petitioner argues that no provisions are spelled out in the Rules

to initiate disciplinary inquiries in respect of retired officers.

Now I need to examine the relevant provisions of the said Rules of the SMIB with respect to

the power of the Disciplinary Authority in reference to the orders of the disciplinary inquiries.

Page 5 of 9

16.3-

'When the Disciplinary Authority receives the report of the Inquiry Officer, the former

should himself analyse and study the contents of the report. Thereafter, the

Disciplinary Authority can either agree or disagree with any decision or finding of the

Inquiry Officer in respect of any charge or charges and accept or reject or revise any or

all of the findings of the Inquiry Officer. Where he disagrees clear reasons for such

disagreement must be noted down in the relevant file.'

16.4-

'If the Disciplinary Authority requires further clarification on any point, he may refer

the matter back to the Inquiry Officer for report or further inquiry as necessary. If

circumstances justify it, the Disciplinary Authority may also quash any inquiry

proceedings and order a fresh inquiry, indicating in the relevant file the reasons for

such action.'

In terms of the above provisions, the Disciplinary Authority has the discretion either to agree

or disagree with any final decision or finding of an Inquiry Officer. If the Disciplinary

Authority disagrees with any such finding he must note down the clear reasons for such

disagreement in the relevant file. Further, the Disciplinary Authority is empowered either to

refer the matter back to the Inquiry Officer or to quash the inquiry proceedings and order a

fresh inquiry. The mandatory requirement therein is to note down the reasons for such a

decision in the relevant file. The Petitioner having limited the reliefs to paragraph 'C' of his

prayer asserts that the reasons in regard to the decision to conduct a fresh inquiry have not

been communicated to him and accordingly, the said decision to hold a fresh inquiry is

unreasonable, irrational and ultra vires. Thus, a reasonable question arises at this stage

whether the Disciplinary Authority while recording the reasons in the relevant file is bound

to communicate such reasons to the Petitioner.

As opposed to the arguments raised by the Petitioner, the contents of the letter dated

06.01.2021 marked R9 are drawn to the attention of this Court by the 1st to 8th, 9A and 10th

Respondents (Respondents). In the said letter R9 the General Manager/ Chief Executive

Officer of SMIB communicates with the Inquiry Officer of the first disciplinary inquiry the

Page 6 of 9

reasons as to why the former has not agreed with the findings of the disciplinary order. In

addition to the aforesaid 'R9', the SMIB even at its Board Meeting held on 20.07.2021 resolved

to initiate a fresh disciplinary inquiry against the Petitioner and as a consequence, the 10th

Respondent was appointed as the Inquiry Officer. The extract of the minutes of the said Board

meeting is marked R10. Anyhow, the Petitioner has raised objections continuously for

conducting a fresh disciplinary inquiry against him.

There cannot be any ambiguity on the point that the Disciplinary Authority has in fact

formulated specific reasons for his decision to conduct a fresh inquiry against the Petitioner.

This is clearly evinced in the said letter marked 'R9', though that document is not a copy of

the minute sheets or other pages of whatever the file maintained by the SMIB dealing with

the affairs of the first disciplinary inquiry. It is important to note that there are no expressed

provisions in the 'Rules' that the Disciplinary Authority is duty-bound to communicate his

decisions that are recorded in the relevant file. Anyhow, I must draw my attention to the

aspect of whether there is any breach of the rules of Natural Justice by the SMIB for not

communicating such reasons in a specific communique to the Petitioner.

I take the view that when assaying whether the rules of Natural Justice are violated the court

cannot stick only to the traditional yardsticks. With the evolution of legal jurisprudence, the

concept of Natural Justice has gone beyond its ancient parameters which are generally

considered as the Rule Against Bias1 and the Right to a Fair Hearing2. The scope of the rule

of Natural Justice has been expanded through judicial activism to give a broader definition

which also includes the 'duty to act fairly'. However, it cannot be restricted to the said concept

of fairness as the rules of Natural Justice have now been crystalised into various dimensions.

Thus, the right of a litigant to know the reasons for the decision taken by the public authority

is an essential element in establishing the Rules of Natural Justice. In this backdrop, the

assessment of violation of the rules of Natural Justice should be analysed based on the facts

and circumstances of each case.

It is noted that my findings above corroborate the conceptual framework illustrated in the

following paragraph in M.P. Jain and S.N. Jain 'Principles of Administrative Law', 9th ed. (2022)

LexisNexis, p.412

"What are the requirements of natural justice cannot be laid down in any straight-jacket. This is

a well-settled position in law. The facts and circumstances of the case in question would alone

provide the answer whether natural justice has been complied with or not. This is so well-settled

position by now that no case law need be adverted on this subject." 3

No evidence is available to form an opinion that the SMIB has suppressed the reasons to call

for a fresh inquiry. The Petitioner has not denied having knowledge of issuing the above-

mentioned letter marked 'R9' but has only attempted to elucidate the facts described therein.

In the Counter Affidavit, the Petitioner has just made a general denial upon the respective

provisions in the Statement of Objections of the Respondents rather than expressly contesting

the existence of the aforementioned document 'R9'. The Respondents contend that there is no

specific necessity to record reasons on the face of the document containing the findings of the

Inquiry Officer. Nevertheless, the Disciplinary Authority has seemingly taken much effort to

elaborate on such reasons in the said letter marked R9. Similarly, the Petitioner has failed to

establish any inordinate or unreasonable delay on the part of the SMIB in forwarding the

report of the first disciplinary inquiry. As observed earlier the Inquiry Officer has taken more

than ten months to forward his final report ('R7(a)') to SMIB after the conclusion of its

proceedings.

Based on the facts and overall circumstances of this case, I am not convinced that the

Petitioner was prejudiced by any conduct of the relevant authorities, in failing to make the

Petitioner aware of the reasons recorded by the Disciplinary Authority to hold a fresh

disciplinary inquiry. Thus, I am not inclined to consider the relief prayed for in paragraph 'C'

of the prayer merely based on the proposition of the Petitioner that the reasons to summon a

fresh inquiry have not been communicated to him.

Now I advert to the circumstances relating to the second disciplinary inquiry held against the

Petitioner after his retirement. The Respondents contend that the Petitioner has failed to

appear before the second disciplinary inquiry despite him being informed, in writing, the

necessity of his appearance. The stand taken by the Petitioner that no disciplinary inquiry can

be conducted against retired officers is a proposition to which I cannot simply agree. In this

regard I need to draw my attention to the provisions of section 36:4 of Chapter XLVIII of the

Establishments Code (E-Code) which declare that the Disciplinary Authority can conduct a

disciplinary inquiry against an officer retired subject to section 12 of the Minutes of the

Pensions irrespective of the retirement of such officer. I am aware that the SMIB is not

governed under the E-Code or the Minutes on Pensions, but the rationale adopted in those

sections has a considerable bearing in this case.

The Petitioner was absent at the inquiry held on 01.04.2022 and even on the subsequent dates.

Due to such absence of the Petitioner, the new Inquiry Officer has decided to proceed with

the fresh disciplinary inquiry ex parte. Upon the conclusion of the said second inquiry by the

10th Respondent, the Petitioner was found guilty of all twelve charges against him. The

respective disciplinary report dated 5.7.2022 is marked R14. The Petitioner was duly

informed about the said second disciplinary order and as a consequence his services have been

terminated with effect from his date of retirement (i.e., 15.12.2020) barring him from any

entitlement to terminal benefits by the letter dated 10.08.2022 marked R15. Apparently, the

Petitioner has not lodged an appeal against the said disciplinary order ('R14') though he was

privileged to do so under the provisions of the Rules of the SMIB. Neither does he challenge

the said report through the instant Application. Further, I take the view that the Petitioner

has failed to satisfy Court that the author of the impugned document 'P19' has acted beyond

his jurisdiction and contrary to principles of Natural Justice or pronounces a decision which

is eminently irrational or unreasonable.

In these circumstances, I do not see any necessity to analyse the objections raised by the

Respondents who argue that this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the instant Application

as it deals with matters arising from a contract of employment between the Petitioner and the

Page 9 of 9

SMIB. However, it is important to note that this court has constantly decided4 that the Court

of Appeal has the discretionary power to exercise writ jurisdiction even on a question arising

out of a contract of employment if the disciplinary order of a public authority was in breach

of statutory restrictions/provisions and also if the public authority has taken a decision

assuming a jurisdiction which he does not have or exceeding his jurisdiction by violating a

statutory requirement which eventually comes under any of the established grounds of judicial

review.

For the reasons set forth above I hold that the Petitioner is not entitled to the relief as prayed

for in paragraph 'C' of the prayer of the Petition. Hence, I proceed to dismiss this Application.

I order no costs.

Application is dismissed.
