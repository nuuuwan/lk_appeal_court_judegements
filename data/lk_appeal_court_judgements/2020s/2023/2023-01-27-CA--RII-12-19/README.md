The Defendant-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner Pradeshiya

Sabha), a local government body established pursuant to the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act No.

15 of 1987, as amended, seeks restitutio-in-integrum in order to set aside a settlement

(dated 4th July 2017 P20) which it entered into, and the decree entered pursuant to the

said settlement, in Case No. 2519/L in the District Court of Panadura and/or to restore

the Petitioner to the status quo prior to the said settlement. It is alleged that the

settlement was entered by an officer of the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha who did not have

the authority to do so, and, consequently, the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha is not bound

by the terms thereof. Therefore, the key issue to be determined is whether the Petitioner

Pradeshiya Sabha is bound by this settlement.

Prior to dealing with that issue, the factual background is set out as follows.

According to the Petition, in 2013, the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha received

several complaints from residents of the Malamulla area of Panadura about the

unsatisfactory condition of the Mandawala Road in Panadura which was submerged in

water. An investigation revealed that this occurred due to the actions of the Plaintiff-

Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Respondents). A culvert, constructed across

Page 3 of 11

the Mandawala road, that allowed excess water to flow from the Mandawala road through

a natural watercourse or channel on the Respondents land to the canal situated on the

other side of that land (as depicted in P2) was filled up with soil by the Respondents.

This blocked the free flow of excess water into the canal (through the Respondents land)

and thereby flooded the road. There was a wall in the process of construction as well,

which increased the flooding. The Respondents were asked to temporarily halt the

construction of the wall (P3). Acting under Section 81 of the Act, the Petitioner

Pradeshiya Sabha passed a resolution to take steps to clear the obstruction in the culvert

and permit the free flow of water. Notice was issued to the Respondents requiring them

to clear the obstruction in the culvert. The Respondents, ignoring that notice, proceeded

to construct the wall, which further obstructed the water drainage. The Petitioner

Pradeshiya Sabha by letter dated 21st November 2013 (P6) wrote to the 2nd Respondent

stating that they had violated Section 47(1) of the Act and requested its removal.

In March 2014, the Respondents instituted an action in the District Court of

Panadura against the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha, claiming that the Petitioner

Pradeshiya Sabha had no servitude or any right over the Respondents private land. As

set out in their Plaint (P10) the Respondents had, for easy access to the back of their

large property, caused a private road to be created on their property (depicted as Lot 2B

in Plan No. 1369 dated 21.11.2005 Fourth Schedule in the Plaint) from Mandawala road.

The Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha had around November 2013 excavated and removed soil

at the entrance of that internal road (a road built on the private property of the

Respondents for their easy access) and constructed a culvert allowing water to flow

through the said internal road (i.e., through the Respondents land). It is claimed that as

a result, both their house and the yarn factory they operate which is situated on the same

land were flooded. The Respondents prayed for, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that

the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha had no rights or servitude to or over the land; a

declaratory judgment that the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha had no right to allow excess

water to drain through the Respondents property.

The Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha, filing its answer (P11), claimed that the excess

water collected on Mandawala Road was ordinarily and for some time drained through

the Respondents land and that the Respondents had obstructed the culvert across

Mandawala Road blocking the free flow of water.

Page 4 of 11

The Respondents had also sought a Commission for a survey of the Respondents

land to be undertaken, which was returned to the Court with the Plan and Report of the

relevant Licensed Surveyor, and a Commission for a valuation report of the damages

caused by the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha.

During the pendency of the case, the term of office of the members of the Petitioner

Pradeshiya Sabha came to an end on the 15th of May 2015. In terms of the Act, when the

term of office of members of a Pradeshiya Sabha ends, until the commencement of the

new term of its members after an election, the Secretary of the Pradeshiya Sabha

exercises, performs, and discharges all the rights, privileges, powers, duties, and functions

vested in or conferred or imposed on, the Pradeshiya Sabha, the Chairman or Vice-

Chairman by the Act or by any other written law (Section 9(3) of the Act).

While the Secretary was in control of the affairs of the Petitioner Pradeshiya

Sabha, on the 4th of July 2017, the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha and the Respondents

entered into the impugned settlement (P20), wherein it was agreed, among other things,

that the land concerned (Lot No. 2B in Plan No. 1369) belonged to the Respondents and

that the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha had no servitude or right whatsoever to or over that

land; the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha would divert the drainage of water from the

Respondents land to the canal down Miriswatte Road. The Secretary, thereafter, sought

a report from the Road Development Authority and wrote to the Project Engineer of the

Kalutara District to divert the drainage of water down the road elsewhere.

Once local government elections were conducted, the Councillors were elected in

May 2018. It is only then, that the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha became aware that a

settlement of such nature had been entered. It learned that the settlement was entered

by one W.A. Padmasena, Work Superintendent of the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha during

the time the Authority was under the control of the Secretary. This settlement, it is

alleged, was entered by the Work Superintendent acting in concert and collusion,

fraudulently with the Respondents; in violation of Sections 47(1), 81, and 82 of the Act,

and without due consideration to the fact that the Respondents were in clear violation of

the Act. The Work Superintendents services were suspended (P24). As the road

continued to get submerged during heavy rainfall, in order to urgently grant relief to the

inhabitants of the area, the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha yet again resolved to permit

drainage through the Respondents land, and thereafter steps were taken to demolish part

Page 5 of 11

of the stone wall, built by the Respondents, that obstructed the flow of water. The

Respondents then in 2018, applied to the District Court to execute the decree.

The Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha claims that although they took steps to build an

alternate drain as proposed in the settlement, the Project Engineer of the National Water

Supply and Drainage Board, Panadura, wrote to it that a drain cannot be built because of

underlying pipelines (P38). An application was made under Section 839 of the Civil

Procedure Code by the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha to set aside the settlement, but that

application was dismissed by Order dated 22nd August 2019 (P37). The Petitioner

Pradeshiya Sabha is, therefore, now before us seeking restitution.

One ground urged by the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha is that once the term of

office of the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha ended, the Respondents ought to have

added or substituted the Secretary of the Pradeshiya Sabha in the District Court action.

They rely on the case of Deejay Industries Limited v. Dehiwala Mount Lavinia

Municipal Council [1986] 2 SLR 365 to support this contention.

In the said case, the action for a particular declaration was originally filed against

the Special Commissioner, Dehiwala- Mt. Lavinia Municipal Council. The Municipal

Council had been dissolved in terms of Section 277 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance

on 15th February 1977. It was reconstituted on 1st July 1979. Following its reconstitution,

the Plaintiff moved to amend the Plaint by removing the words The Special

Commissioner, so that the action would in effect be against the Council. His Lordship

G.P.S. De Silva J. (as he then was) concluded, firstly, that the Special Commissioner

was a corporate soul and was capable of being sued nomine officii. Secondly, his Lordship

observed, in response to the argument of the Defendant that the Council should have been

the proper party defendant despite its dissolution since the Council perpetually succeeds:

It seems to me that the expression "perpetual succession" denotes no more than the

continuing existence of a company (or a corporation) irrespective of changes in its membership. In

the case of a corporation sole, the transfer, resignation, retirement or death of the holder of the

office for the time being does not bring its corporate existence to an end. This, however, does not

and cannot mean, that the legal existence of the corporate body cannot be brought to an end. Thus

Salmond on Jurisprudence (12th Ed.) states:

Page 6 of 11

The birth and death of legal persons are determined not by nature, but by the law. They

come into existence at the will, of the " law, and they endure during its good pleasure....... They are

in their own nature capable of indefinite duration, this being indeed one of their chief virtues as

compared with humanity, but they are not incapable of destruction. The extinction of a body

corporate is called its dissolution - the severing of that legal bond by which its members are knit

together into a unity.........

A Municipal Council is a corporate body created by statute. It can be dissolved in the

manner provided by the statute to which it owes its origin. Part I of the Ordinance provides for the

constitution of Municipal Councils. Part XIV provides inter alia for their dissolution. As submitted

by Mr. de Silva [Counsel for the Plaintiff], "dissolution" is the antithesis of "constitution". Once the

Municipal Council is "dissolved" in terms of section 277 it means the cessation of its legal existence.

Dissolution cannot be reconciled with its continued existence. Upon dissolution it suffers a legal

death and cannot sue or be sued. [emphasis added]

On that basis, his Lordship concluded that the action was originally properly

instituted, and that the amendment was correct.

This proposition of law is not applicable to the facts of the present case. This is

because, there is no dissolution of the Pradeshiya Sabha which has resulted in the

cessation of its legal existence. The Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha did not legally breathe

its last. There is only a change in the membership as a result of the term of office of the

members of the Pradeshiya Sabha having come to an end; an expiration of the term of

office. It would be a dissolution, resulting in cessation of legal existence, for example, if

the Minister acts under the provisions of Section 9A of the Act.

The view taken by his Lordship Janak De Silva J. in Vithana Kuruppu

Aarachchige Anura v. Mahesh Wickrama & Others CA/MC/Rev/12/2017 decided on

22.07.2020, is more appropriate to the instant case. His Lordship distinguished the two

different regimes that operate when a Municipal Council is dissolved and when the term

of office of its members ends. The Council itself would be at an end when it loses its legal

personality. Such a result can be triggered by a specific statutory provision, such as

Section 277 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance. His Lordship opined:

when the term of office of the members of the Colombo Municipal Council came to an end,

the Municipal Council of Colombo did not cease to exist as a legal entity.

Page 7 of 11

Therefore, we do not agree with the contention of the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha

that the Secretary should have been substituted or added as a party in the original action

once the term of office of the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha expired. Since that is not

a cessation of legal existence.

The next issue, the crux of the present application, is to see whether the terms of

the settlement are binding on the Pradeshiya Sabha.

Section 9(2) provides that the Secretary is the Chief Administrative Officer of the

Pradeshiya Sabha. Section 9(3) reads:

Where a Pradeshiya Sabha is unable to discharge its functions by reason of the Chairman

and Vice-Chairman ceasing to hold office, the Secretary shall, during any period that elapses

between the occurrence of the vacancies in respect of those offices and the filling of those vacancies

in accordance with the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance, have, exercise

perform and discharge all the rights, privilege, powers, duties and functions vested in or conferred

or imposed on, the Pradeshiya Sabha, the Chairman or Vice-Chairman by this Act or by any other

written law. [emphasis added]

This subsection provides for the continuation of the administration and the

functions of the Pradeshiya Sabha, which would otherwise come to a grinding halt and

thereby cause hardship and inconvenience to its service recipients and beneficiaries. The

Secretary becomes the statutory repository of all the rights, privileges, powers, duties

and functions of that of the Pradeshiya Sabha.

On a perusal of the record, it appears that the Secretary, acting as the statutory

repository had entered that settlement. Although the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha has

taken steps to sanction the Work Superintendent who entered into the settlement, by

suspending his services, it did not act with the same vigour against the Secretary. This is

perhaps because it knew that the Secretary was statutorily vested with the power to enter

such a settlement, and therefore sought to sanction the Work Superintendent as the

sacrificial lamb. In its Petition itself, we are told that the Secretary had written to the

Project Engineer of the Kalutara District trying to divert the water down the road

elsewhere (P21).

If the settlement had been entered into without the knowledge of and not on the

Secretary's instructions, then the settlement's validity could be called into question.

Page 8 of 11

However, in the instant case, the Secretary had not taken any steps to apply to Court to

rectify the situation and set the record straight.

The Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha is also quiet on whether the Secretary had

instructed the Work Superintendent to enter the settlement. Instead, in its written

submissions, it conveniently states that there is no evidence to show that the Secretarys

power has been delegated to the Work Superintendent, instead of a genuine attempt to

submit evidence of the Secretary himself, such as by an affidavit to substantiate its

contention.

The Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha then takes up the position that the Secretary in

any event cannot delegate any power to any other person because the Secretary himself

is a statutory delegatee.

We cannot agree with that argument because Section 9(3) confers on the Secretary

the powers of the Pradeshiya Sabha in the interim period between the end of the members

term of office and the election of new members. As alluded to above, this is envisaged to

ensure the continuity of the functions of the Pradeshiya Sabha, which would otherwise be

at a standstill. In the present case, the new members werent in office for three years.

These powers that the Secretary exercised by virtue of Section 9(3) will then include the

power of the chairman to delegate as well. The Chairmans powers to delegate are

provided in Section 8. Subsections 2 and 3 of Section 8 provide:

(2)The Chairman may by order in writing delegate to the Vice-Chairman or Secretary or any other

officer of the Pradeshiya Sabha any of the powers, duties or functions conferred or imposed upon

or vested in the Chairman by this Act or any other written law.

(3)The exercise, discharge or performance by the Vice Chairman or the Secretary or any other

officer of the Pradeshiya Sabha of any power, duty or function delegated to him by order of the

Chairman, shall be subject to such conditions and restrictions and limited to such purpose or

purposes as may be specified in the order: and any such delegation on may at any time be varied

or cancelled by order of the Chairman.

Therefore, in terms of the statute, the Secretary becomes the statutory repository

of the powers of the Pradeshiya Sabha, whose members are not in office due to their terms

of office coming to an end. This is until new members assume office. The Secretary can

Page 9 of 11

exercise such power of delegation as well. There is nothing to show that the Secretary did

not authorise or instruct the Work Superintendent to enter the settlement. The Secretary

could have applied to Court to set aside the settlement if the Superintendent did not have

authority, or if the Superintendent was colluding with the Respondents. Instead, the

Secretary appears to have acted on the settlement.

The Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha was also represented by Counsel throughout the

proceedings. An affidavit from the Counsel appearing on their behalf setting out on whose

instructions the same was entered could have shed light on this issue.

Further, it is highly unlikely that the Secretary can claim ignorance of the

settlement since the proposal for settlement was in consideration for about a year before

it was entered, as per the journal entries.

As the Secretary appears to be legally empowered to enter such a settlement, we

cannot therefore set aside the same.

Another reason and perhaps a more important reason why the Petitioner

Pradeshiya Sabha is disentitled from claiming restitutio-in-integrum is because of its

unlawful conduct.

The Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha had admittedly acted to remove the purported

obstruction in order to enable the free flow of excess water, despite the terms of the

settlement, and the decree thereon, continuing to be in force. The importance of abiding

by the terms of the settlement has been reiterated by our courts. His Lordship Herat J. in

Sinna Veloo v. Messrs. Lipton Ltd. 66 NLR 214 held:

Once the terms of settlement are presented to Court as an agreed upon settlement, the

Court can enter a decree thereon. Once such a settlement so agreed upon is presented to Court and

notified thereto and recorded by Court, a party cannot resile from the settlement even though the

decree has not yet been entered.

While we recognise that the motive may have been sincere, and in the interests of

the inhabitants of the area, we cannot condone that course of action since it should have

been judicially sanctioned. To paraphrase the words of Lord Keith in Lloyd v. McMahon

Page 10 of 11

[1987] 2 WLR 821, the sincerity of the Pradeshiya Sabhas motives is not something

capable of justifying or excusing the failure to abide by the settlement.

This does not in any way extend to, or should be read to stifle administrative

action, in emergency situations with potentials of dire consequences that require

immediate administrative action, provided such action is justifiable in the public interest.

However, in the facts of the present case, when it was well known that the road can get

submerged, as it had happened over the years, there was time and space to apply to court

and have such removal judicially sanctioned, so that the rights and interests of all parties

are well protected. The need for judicial sanction is because the terms of the settlement

were operative in the eyes of the law. It is not possible to claim that the breach occurred

prior to entering the decree, as entering the decree is only a ministerial act. One need not

have waited for a torrential downpour, and then a blockage to arise, to invoke necessity

and then justify taking the law into ones own hands. Steps could have been taken to

remedy the situation.

It is well-settled law that to claim an extraordinary remedy such as restitution,

the applicant must be of clean hands. We cannot, therefore, grant this extraordinary relief

because the conduct of the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha disentitles it to it.

Having said that, an amicable solution must be found in order to prevent such

flooding. This is considering the interests of the area inhabitants who would be

inconvenienced. Our attention is drawn to the Report regarding the issue of culvert at

Ch. 00+180 in Road ID 16 prepared by the Resident Engineer Kalutara (P29(ii)). It

notes that building a drain along the road and diverting it to the canal down Miriswatte

road is not realistic and sustainable according to the existing elevation and that

reconstruction of existing culvert or construction of a new culvert close to existing culvert

is the most realistic solution. This is relied on by the Petitioner Pradeshiya Sabha to

demonstrate the impracticability of giving effect to the terms of the settlement which

provide for diverting the flow of water from the Respondents land to the canal down

Miriswatte Road.

A rather pragmatic solution has been proffered by the Project Engineer of the Road

Development Authority, Kalutara. That is to acquire the relevant portion of the land so

Page 11 of 11

that a drain could be created across the land. In the letter dated 17th July 2018 (P25) he

states:

The Respondents in their written submissions also alluded to the same. On page 3

it states:

..whereby the line ministry has informed Defendant Pradeshiya Sabha saying that they

could resolve this problem only by acquiring a portion of the adjacent land. It is not disputed that

Pradeshiya Sabha has not taken steps to execute such acquisition.

For the foregoing reasons, this application is dismissed. We order costs.
