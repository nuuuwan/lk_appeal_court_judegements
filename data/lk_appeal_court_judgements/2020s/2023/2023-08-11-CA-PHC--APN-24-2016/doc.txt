Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an application by the respondent-respondent-petitioner (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the petitioner) invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of

this Court under and in terms of Article 138 of the Constitution on the basis of

being aggrieved by the order dated 16-02-2016 by the learned High Court Judge

of the Provincial High Court of North Western Province holden at Chilaw.

The petitioner has also filed an appeal bearing Case No. PHC-0022-16 to this

Court challenging the same order pronounced by the learned High Court Judge.

At the hearing of this application, the parties agreed that the judgement

pronounced in this revision application shall be applicable to the above-

Page 4 of 15

mentioned appeal filed as well. Therefore, this judgement shall conclude both

the applications before this Court.

The facts relevant to the order pronounced by the learned High Court Judge can

be summarized in the following manner.

The petitioner-petitioner-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the respondent)

initiated proceedings against the petitioner who was the area sales agent of

Ceylon Tobacco Company before the Magistrate Court of Chilaw under the

National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act No. 27 of 2006 (hereinafter

referred to as the Act) as amended by Amendment Act No. 03 of 2015, alleging

that he had in his possession, six cardboard boxes containing tobacco products

namely, cigarettes, manufactured by the Ceylon Tobacco Company without the

required pictorial warnings as stipulated by the Act on the said six boxes. It

appears from the report filed before the learned Magistrate that the petitioner

has allegedly committed an offence in terms of section 34 (1) of the Act.

In this process, the respondent had seized following items from the possession

of the petitioner.

1. 3 cardboard boxes containing 10000 Gold leaf cigarettes each, in

properly prepared cigarette packets with the necessary pictorial

warning.

2. 01 cardboard box containing 12000 Gold leaf cigarettes in properly

prepared cigarette packets with the necessary pictorial warning.

3. 02 cardboard boxes containing 10000 Bristol cigarettes each, in

properly prepared cigarette packets with the necessary pictorial

warning.

When these items were produced before the learned Magistrate of Chilaw, the

petitioner has admitted that the 6 large cardboard boxes which contained in the

cigarette packets in separate cartons had no pictorial warnings. It had been his

position that since these large cardboard boxes were only used to transport the

packets of cigarettes, the said boxes would not be sold to the end user or the

Page 5 of 15

customer. He has further taken up the position that, the individual cigarette

packets or the cigarette cartons which contained several separate cigarette

packets had the necessary pictorial warnings in terms of the Act and therefore,

he was not in violation of the relevant provisions of the Act.

When the seizure of these items was reported to the Magistrate Court, it clearly

appears that there was no dispute that the cigarettes seized are products

manufactured by the Ceylon Tobacco Company. Therefore, they are legally

manufactured cigarettes, where the company has paid the due taxes to the

government and can be sold in the open market as stipulated by the law.

When this matter was taken up before the learned Magistrate of Chilaw on 8th

December 2015, the petitioner has made an application to the learned Magistrate

that since the petitioner has admitted that there were no pictorial warnings in

the 6 large cardboard boxes and since the cigarettes are legally manufactured

cigarettes valued at Rs. 1786080/=, it should to be released to the petitioner. It

has been informed to the Court that there are two types of cigarettes in these 6

boxes. In 5 boxes, there are cigarette packets containing 20 cigarettes each and

in the other box, the cigarette packets contain 12 cigarettes each, and in total

3500 cigarette packets in all 6 boxes which has a total of 62000 cigarette sticks.

The learned Magistrate has inspected the relevant cardboard boxes in open

Court and has observed that these cigarette packets are in separate cartons,

however, has not made an order in relation to the application by the petitioner,

but has directed the parties to file written submissions.

When this matter was mentioned again on 15-12-2015, the respondent had been

represented by a Senior State Counsel of the Attorney Generals Department,

and she has made oral submissions before the Court, and after making lengthy

submissions, has requested the Court to send the productions in its totality,

namely, the 6 large sealed cardboard boxes together with its contents to the

Government Analyst requiring the Government Analyst to answer the following

questions.

Page 6 of 15

.

2. ?

3. 2015 03

( ) 2 3 ?

4. ?

It had been the position of the learned Senior State Counsel that the answers to

the above questions can be provided only by the Government Analyst, and there

cannot be admissions recorded in that regard, and that this information would

be necessary for the prosecution to prove its case.

It had been the position of the learned Counsel who represented the petitioner

before the Magistrate Court of Chilaw, that the petitioner was not in violation of

the requirements of the Act, and had moved for the release of the productions

and discharge of the petitioner from the proceedings on the basis that the

prosecution has failed to show any prima facie basis that an action can be

maintained against the petitioner. He has also contended that there was no

necessity to send the productions to the Government Analyst.

The learned Magistrate of Chilaw has pronounced his order in relation to the

applications made by both the parties on 12-01-2016. In his order, he has

decided to allow the application made by the learned Senior State Counsel to

send the productions to the Government Analyst.

However, considering the admissions made in open Court and facts undisputed

in relation to this matter, he has decided that sending the legally manufactured

cigarettes valued over Rs. 1.7 Million to the Government Analyst would not be

necessary for the purposes of this action. Accordingly, he has directed the

Registrar of the Court to retain the 6 cardboard boxes which are the disputed

boxes without the alleged pictorial warnings in terms of the Act, and also to

retain one carton each which has several cigarette packets in it from each of the

Page 7 of 15

6 boxes and to release the rest of the cigarettes on a bond to the petitioner. He

has decided that he will decide on the other objections taken by the petitioner at

the conclusion of the case.

Once this order was pronounced, the learned Senior State Counsel has requested

the learned Magistrate to order that two large boxes, inclusive of the cigarettes

contained therein to be sent to the Government Analyst although her previous

application was to send the entire consignment of cigarettes along with the 6

large boxes. However, the learned Magistrate had refused the said request as he

had already pronounced his order in that regard.

The respondent has preferred an application in revision through a Senior State

Counsel on the basis of being aggrieved by the said order of the learned

Magistrate of Chilaw, in terms of Article 154P of The Constitution to the

Provincial High Court of North Western Province holden at Chilaw challenging

the said order.

In his petition before the High Court, the relief sought by the respondent had

been as follows.

()

() 2016-01-12

()

()

It needs to be noted that the respondent has not sought any final relief against

the order of the learned Magistrate, but has sought only to stay the learned

Magistrates order.

In terms of the appellate procedure rules, a party seeking an interim order in

relation to an order or a judgement pronounced by a Court of First Instance, has

to give notice to the opposing party, unless the party challenging the order or the

Page 8 of 15

judgement seeks to dispense with the said requirement on the basis of urgency.

I find no averment or averments containing such a statement in the petition filed

by the respondent through a learned Senior State Counsel of the Attorney

Generals Department.

However, this matter has been supported on 21-01-2016 before the learned High

Court Judge of Chilaw without notice to the opposing party, and the learned

Senior State Counsel who supported the petition has sought the suspension of

the order dated 12-01-2016 by the learned Magistrate of Chilaw and also the

release of the productions as directed by the learned Magistrate, and for notice

on the respondents mention in the petition.

The learned High Court Judge after considering the application has determined

that the facts submitted to him are facts that shocks the conscience of the Court

and therefore, has determined that there is a need for immediate interference

into the order of the learned Magistrate. Accordingly, has ordered the suspension

of the release of the productions of the petitioner, and has directed that notice

should be sent to the respondents mentioned in the petition.

The petitioner, being the respondent mentioned in the application before the

High Court has taken up a preliminary objection as to the maintainability of the

application on the basis that the respondent who was the petitioner in the

application has no right to maintain a revision application before the High Court

without a final relief being sought, and also on the basis that the respondent

being the petitioner, has failed to tender all the necessary documents relating to

the order pronounced by the learned Magistrate of Chilaw along with his petition,

which was in violation of the Supreme Court Rules of Procedure in relation to an

application of this nature.

However, this preliminary objection has been overruled by the learned High

Court Judge on the basis that if the Court grants permission for a stay order of

the order dated 12-01-2016 pronounced by the learned Magistrate that itself

amounts to a final relief, and the respondent who is the petitioner in the

Page 9 of 15

application, by filing documents marked P-01 to P-07, has cumulatively provided

sufficient information to the Court to determine the matter.

After hearing the parties, the learned High Court Judge by his order dated 16-

02-2016 has made the impugned order sought to be challenged in this revision

application before the Court.

For matters of clarity, I would now reproduce the said order in its entirety which

reads as follows.

It is against the above order the petitioner has come before this Court invoking

the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court.

When the order dated 16-02-2016 reached the learned Magistrate of Chilaw. The

learned Senior State Counsel who represented the respondent has informed the

Court that she is not objecting to the release of the contents in four of the six

cardboard boxes and has requested the Court to send 2 sealed cardboard boxes

with its contents to the Government Analyst and call for the report as requested

earlier. It has also been informed that she would not be objecting for the release

of the rest of the cigarettes to the petitioner.

However, when this application was supported before this Court, this Court

issued a stay order preventing the learned Magistrate from proceeding any

further in the matter before the Magistrate Court, and as a result, it is now

informed to this Court that the said productions have not been sent to the

Government Analyst as yet. However, it appears from the Magistrate Court case

record that apart from two boxes, the contents of the balance four boxes had

been released to the petitioner on a bond, and the mentioned two boxes along

with its contents are in the Court custody. It had been informed to the Court

that the expiry date of the cigarettes manufactured will be 6 months from the

date of manufacture.

At the hearing of this matter, this Court had the benefit of listening to the learned

Presidents Counsel, and also had the opportunity of listening to the views

expressed by the learned Additional Solicitor General who represented the

respondent.

The facts that have been presented before the learned Magistrate of Chilaw and

before this Court clearly demonstrates that the matter that had to be determined

by the learned Magistrate was whether the petitioner has violated the provisions

of section 34 (1) of the Act by failing to display the required pictorial warning on

the 6 large cardboard boxes used to transport the packets of cigarettes produced

before the Court.

Page 11 of 15

As stated before, the position of the petitioner had been that there was no

violation of the provisions of the relevant section. Since there was no dispute as

to the fact that the cigarettes contained in the boxes are legally manufactured

cigarettes and the packets of cigarettes and the cartons found inside the boxes

had the necessary pictorial warning, the matter that had to be decided by the

Court was only whether the outer 6 boxes which admittedly had no pictorial

warning violates the provisions of the Act and nothing else.

It is clear from the applications initially made before the learned Magistrate of

Chilaw, those applications had been made with the clear intention of causing

maximum difficulties and loss to the petitioner. The cigarettes the petitioner had

in his possession were legally manufactured products permitted to be sold in the

open market. There cannot be any argument that the relevant manufacturer has

paid due taxes for the cigarettes manufactured before releasing them to its

authorized agent for the purpose of sale. It is an admitted fact that the end

product that would in fact go into the hands of a consumer or a customer had

the necessary warning as required by law. Therefore, the matter that would

necessarily be required to be determined by the learned Magistrate was a matter

of a technical nature.

I do not find any basis for the application made by the learned Senior State

Counsel who represented the respondent before the Magistrate Court to send all

the 6 large boxes along with its contents to the Government Analyst.

As pointed out correctly by the learned Presidents Counsel, the Government

Analyst would not be able to answer any of the questions raised in a positive

manner, if the productions were in fact sent to the Government Analyst.

There was no dispute before the Court that the tobacco found in the cigarettes

belongs to the Ceylon Tobacco Company. The Government Analyst would not be

able to express an opinion whether the petitioner has violated the provisions of

the Act which is a matter for the Court to determine after a proper trial. There

was no dispute that the 6 large boxes are boxes made of cardboard.

Page 12 of 15

I find no basis for the contention that it is only the Government Analyst who can

provide answers to these questions and the answers, if provided, are necessary

for the prosecution to prove whatever the possible charge against the petitioner.

Therefore, it is the considered view of this court that the learned Magistrate of

Chilaw was correct in refusing to act as a rubber stamp of the learned Senior

State Counsel when he refused the application as to the manner how the

productions should be sent to the Government Analyst.

The learned Magistrate after considering the submissions made by the parties

and admissions before him, had decided only to send samples taken out of the

6 boxes and release the rest of the cigarettes to the petitioner which was the

correct order the learned Magistrate should have pronounced under the

circumstances.

It is trite law that a judge should not be a rubber stamp of a prosecutor or

investigating officer under the guise of his duty to assist investigations in a

criminal matter.

The relevant section 124 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act which was

considered by the learned High Court Judge in his order to determine that the

learned Magistrate has failed to assist the investigator reads as follows.

124. Every Magistrate to whom application is made in that behalf

shall assist the conduct of an investigation by making and issuing

appropriate orders and process of Court and may, in particular hold,

or authorize the holding of, an identification parade for the purpose

of ascertaining the identity of the offender, and may for such purpose

require a suspect or another person to participate in such parade,

allow a witness to make his identification from a concealed position

and make or cause to be made a record of the proceedings of such

parade.

Page 13 of 15

It is noteworthy to mention that under the section, a Magistrate is required to

make and issue only the appropriate orders and process, and not all the orders

requested by an investigator.

In the case of Mahanama Tillakaratne Vs. Bandula Wickramasinghe and

Others (1999) 1 SLR 372 which was a Fundamental Rights violation application

which involved issuing of an arrest warrant, it was stated by Deeraratne, J. at

page 382,

Issuing a warrant is a judicial act involving the liberty of an individual and

no warrant of arrest should be lightly issued by a Magistrate simply because

a prosecutor or an investigator thinks it is necessary. It must be issued as

the law requires, when a Magistrate is satisfied that he should do so, on the

evidence taken before him on oath. It must not be issued by a Magistrate to

satisfy the sardonic pleasure of an opinionated investigator or prosecutor.

His Lordship echoed the words of Sampayo, J. in Wills Vs. Sholay Cangany

(1915) 18 NLR 443 which reads thus,

The issue of a warrant is a serious matter and the Magistrate should

exercise his own independent judgement on the facts before he does this

judicial act. In every case, it is the duty of the Magistrate to see that the

complainant or the other person, when icing what purports to be oral

evidence, gives it consciously and with due sense of his own responsibility

and that he not merely adopts general statements already printed and

furnished to him by the proctor. The Magistrate should himself record that

evidence from the witnesss own mouth and should in no case recognize

printed matter contained in forms which the proctor may keep in stock. I

think the practice followed in this case is reprehensible, and I hope not to

see another instance of it.

The underlying principles enunciated in the above judgement was considered by

Shiranee A. Bandaranayake, J. (as she was then) in Danny Vs. Sirinimal Silva,

Page 14 of 15

Inspector of Police and Others (2001) 1 SLR 30) by expressing the following

view;

I must express my concern over Magistrates issuing orders of remand

mechanically, simply because the police want such orders

madeRemanding a person is a judicial act and as such a Magistrate

should bring his judicial mind to bear on that matter before depriving a

person of his liberty.

It is, therefore, trite law that judges are there not to sanction applications by the

prosecutors or investigators merely because they wanted certain things to be

done in the guise of seeking assistance in terms of section 124 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act.

It is very much clear from the order of the learned Magistrate of Chilaw that he

has been mindful of this legal principle when he refused to send all 6 boxes and

the cigarettes in it as requested by the prosecution. He has well evaluated the

necessity to send the productions as sought by the prosecution and has

determined that only the samples and the larger cardboard boxes should be sent

to the Government Analyst, although in my view, even that would be a futile

exercise, given the questions of law involved in this matter.

I find that the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw was misdirected as to the

facts and the relevant law when it was determined that the learned Magistrate

has failed to assist the investigation in this matter. I find that there was no basis

for the learned High Court Judge to come to such a conclusion if the proceedings

before the learned Magistrate was evaluated in the correct perspective.

I find that the petitioner has adduced sufficient exceptional grounds for this

Court to interfere with the order of the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw.

Accordingly, it is my considered view that the order dated 16-02-2016 by the

learned High Court Judge of Chilaw cannot be allowed to stand. Hence, the order

Page 15 of 15

is hereby set aside. I affirm the order dated 12-01-2016 by the learned Magistrate

of Chilaw pronounced in the Magistrate Court of Chilaw Case No. B 1152/2015.

However, since more than seven years have passed from the order, it is the view

of this Court that sending the productions as ordered by the learned Magistrate

in 2016 for a Government Analyst Report should be reconsidered by the learned

Magistrate, as I find it would not serve any purpose as considered earlier in this

judgement.

Although the cigarettes that were detained along with 2 cardboard boxes have

now passed their expiry date, the learned Magistrate is directed to release the

detained cigarette packets after keeping samples, to a nominated representative

of the Ceylon Tobacco Company who manufactured those cigarettes for the

purpose of disposing them in a suitable manner, as they no longer can be used.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgement to the High

Court of Chilaw as well as to the Magistrate Court of Chilaw for necessary action.
