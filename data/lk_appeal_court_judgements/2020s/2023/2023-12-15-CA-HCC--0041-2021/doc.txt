Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused -Appellant Hennadige Asantha Sanjeewa Fernando (hereinafter referred to

as "the Accused") was indicted in the High Courts of Colombo with having being in

possession and trafficking of 82.45g of Heroin on 23.06.2017, near the Pettah bus stand,

in contravention of Section 54A(d) and 54A(b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance, as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

The Trial was before a Judge and after the conclusion of the case, the Learned Trial

Judge convicted the Accused and sentenced him to a term of life imprisonment on both

counts. For the Prosecution, eight witnesses had given evidence. On behalf of the defence,

two witnesses were called to give evidence. Additionally, the Accused made a statement

from the dock to the effect that he was unaware of the Heroin parcel in question, that he

was only a drug addict but not a trafficker, and the parcel was introduced by the Police.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction the Accused filed an Appeal to this Court.

The case for the Prosecution was that on information received by PW06 PC Asanka, PW01

IP Kosala Fernando, was instructed to conduct a raid near the Pettah bus stand around

10:00 a.m. to 10:30 am. They had observed the Accused anxiously coming toward the toilet

behind the bus stop. Since the description that was in their possession matched the

Accused the Police team questioned him. PW01 further describes that the Accused was

Page 3 of 7

carrying a traveling bag that had orange mobile written on it, and after opening that

bag, they found a tulip bag and, inside that bag, they found a pink polythene bag

containing a brown substance; the polythene bag was opened and the substance therein

was identified to be Heroine. Once the parcel was examined, PW01 re-tied the package

with a knot. PW01 also mentioned that apart from the parcel there was also a silver color

electric scale in it.

According to PW01 the Accused was taken into custody at 10:20 a.m. after the

interrogation. Upon information received by him, they left the said place of arrest with

the Accused. First, they went in search of a house belonging to the Accused at Kaulana,

Dehiwala,

According to PW01, there was no illegal substance found in the said house. No one was at

the house at that time. At this juncture a few questions such as how did the Police enter

the house? , who gave the key to open the said premises? Was it already opened? arise

for consideration. According to PW01, no keys were found in the Accused possession.

Thereafter, they proceeded to search the house belonging to one Nishantha at Dehiwala.

According to the evidence, Nishantha and his wife were present during the search. Since

here too, they had not found any illegal substance during the search, they went to the

narcotics bureau where they weighed the parcel and conducted the preliminary tests

relating to it. The evidence indicates that they opened the parcel at that moment as well.

Thereafter, they handed the productions under PR. No 34/17 to (PW12) Keerthi Perera

and No. PR 35/17 to Athula. Thereafter, ( PW12 ) Keerthi Perera took the productions

bearing PR No. 34/2017 to the Government Analyst on 28.06.2017 and obtained the

receipt-bearing No.CD 4705/17 which is marked as P23.

During the proceedings, it was revealed that the productions had been in two grocery

bags; one bag inside the other. This in our view contradicts the evidence of the

investigating officer.

We will now analyze the evidence of the Accused.

According to the Accused, after his arrest at the bus stand, he revealed that he was a

drug addict and it was Nishantha who was the drug dealer. He further revealed that they

searched his house and that they could not find any illegal substance. Thereafter, they

went to another house brought a parcel, and introduced it to him.

The issue before us is whether to believe the story of the Prosecution or the Accused.

We are mindful of the evidence of the Government Analyst.

According to the Government Analyst, she received the parcel which was in a pink

polythene bag tied with a knot that was sealed and stamped. When she cut open the

parcel, she observed that there were two bags.Which shows that Heroin was contained in

two polythene bags. This, in our view, creates a grave reasonable doubt in the Prosecution

case.

Learned Counsel who appeared for the Accused relied on the test of probability and

referred to the evidence of PW01. According to PW01, he never stated that he found two

bags that contained Heroin. The version of events as transpired in his evidence was that

he untied the parcel, identified the Heroin and retied the knot. He stated that even at

the narcotics bureau he opened it for examination purposes and re-tied the knot. This

creates a doubt in our mind. The reason for that is, although one might not see two bags

together at a glance when one opens and reties a bag several times, especially in this case,

where the contains of the bag are subject to a close scrutiny, instead of a fleeting glance,

one would have observed that felt that the parcel contained more than one bag. In the

instant case, he has opened the parcel twice.

We have to consider whether PW01s testimony is improbable. If so, the Learned High

Court Judge failed to consider the test of probability regarding the Prosecutions version.

Probability, in the context of legal matters, is defined as follows:

Sarkar and Monohara, in their book "SARKAR ON EVIDENCE" (Fifteenth Edition)

on page 71, state,

"...probability is meant the likelihood of anything being true, deduced from its conformity

to our knowledge, observation, and experience. When a supposed fact is so repugnant to

the laws of nature that no amount of evidence could induce us to believe it, such supposed

fact is said to be impossible or physically impossible."

According to E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, in "The Law of Evidence Volume II Book

02" on Page 1053,

Page 6 of 7

"The test of improbability has been described as essential inconsistency. There may be

facts which may show it to be impossible or so highly improbable as to justify the inference

that it never occurred."

Furthermore, his Lordship Justice Jayasooriya In Wickremasinghe v. Dedoleena

and others 1996 (2) SLR held that;

A Judge, in applying the test of probabilities and improbability relies heavily on his

knowledge of men and matters and the pattern of conduct observed by human beings both

ingenious as well as those who are less talented and fortunate.

This proposition was followed by his Lordship Justice Gooneratne in, Singharam

Thiyagarajah v. AG CA 216/2010 Decided on 10.10.2014 wherein his Lordship held;

I wish to observe that the realities of life and the testimony of a witness cannot always

be co-related. Nothing is perfect in life and the truth does not surface so easily as a man

so bias could attempt to hide the truth or distort it. The test of probability needs to be

applied and recognized to grapple with normal human behavior and problems and pave

the way for the likelihood of occurrence.

Considering the evidence led by PW01 we note that as per his evidence, he had opened

the parcel and seen the brown substance inside which he identified as Heroin. However,

the Government Analyst, in her evidence, later revealed that there had been two

polythene bags containing Heroin. If a prudent man opened the said parcel, it is most

likely for him to realize that there had been another bag inside the other. The bag itself,

and the contents specially ought to have been examined closely. Therefore, upon applying

the Test of Probability and Test of Improbability to the aforementioned facts, it becomes

evident that the evidence presented through the Prosecution's narratives cannot be

deemed credible, it creates doubt.

This Court agrees with the submission of the Learned Counsel for the Appellant that the

PW01 never opened the bag. The question is what made him not to open the parcel.

According to the Accused, the parcel was introduced by the police. Therefore, we can

conclude that the reason for not opening the parcel by PW01 is that he knew in advance

the parcel contained Heroin

Page 7 of 7

In light of these circumstances, we find that the defense's narrative appears more

plausible than that of the Prosecution. Therefore, on these grounds and for the reasons

detailed above, we overturn the conviction and sentence.

This appeal is allowed.
