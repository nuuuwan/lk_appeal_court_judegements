This is an appeal by the petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved by the order dated 13-05-2020 pronounced by the

learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa Holden

in Kegalle.

From the said order, the learned High Court Judge refused to issue notice of the

revision application filed by the appellant in the High Court of Kegalle Revision

Case Number /5654/2020.

The appellant has filed the above-mentioned revision application invoking the

revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court in order to challenge the order dated

28-02-2020 pronounced by the learned Magistrate of Warakapola, wherein, the

vehicle bearing number SG GA-5320 was confiscated to the state by the learned

Magistrate after holding an inquiry in that regard.

When this matter was taken up for argument, it was brought to the notice of the

Court that the appellant has filed the Revision Application Number

CPA/0023/2022 before this Court invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of this

Court in order to challenge the same order pronounced by the learned High Court

Judge of Kegalle. The parties agreed to abide by the judgement pronounced in

this case in the revision application as well, as both the matters relate to the

Page 4 of 13

same two orders pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of Kegalle and the

learned Magistrate of Warakapola.

The Officer in Charge (OIC) of Warakapola police has charged one Chaga

Narasinghe for transporting six logs of jack timber without a valid permit in the

tipper vehicle numbered SG GA-5320 on 21-07-2019, which is an offence

punishable in terms of the Forest Ordinance as amended.

When the accused was charged before the Magistrates Court of Warakapola, he

has pleaded guilty to the charge and has been fined Rs. 25000/-. The timber has

been confiscated to the state.

The learned Magistrate of Warakapola has released the vehicle on a bond to its

registered owner who is the appellant in this matter, has decided to hold an

inquiry allowing the registered owner to show cause as to why the vehicle

involved in the commission of the offence should not be forfeited to the state.

It is clear that the learned Magistrate has ordered the inquiry as provided for in

the proviso of section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance, as amended by Forest

(Amendment) Act No. 65 of 2009, which reads as follows,

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence, is

a third party, no Order of Confiscation shall be made if such owner

proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements,

cattle and machines, as the case may be, for the commission of the

offence.

At the inquiry held in that regard, the registered owner has given evidence and

has stated that the vehicle was primarily used by him to carry goods for his

business purposes, where he was having a cement block and concrete post

manufacturing facility. He has stated that on the day in question, he had to

deliver 250 cement blocks out of 1000 blocks purchased from him by the

Page 5 of 13

accused in the Magistrates Court case. It had been his position that he did not

drive the vehicle, but employed a person called Chandana Hemantha who

worked in another vehicle whenever it becomes necessary for him to use his own

vehicle to bring in materials for him or to deliver orders.

He has stated that he could not obtain the services of the said Hemantha over

three days and therefore could not deliver the 250 cement blocks he promised to

deliver to the accused. The accused has come in the morning of the day of the

incidents to his workplace and had insisted that he need the balance cement

blocks in order to complete his work before his marriage, which was due to be

held on 12th September.

To substantiate that fact, the appellant has produced the invitation card he

received in that regard as X-01. The accused was a person who lived in the same

area and a person well known to the appellant from his childhood days, and the

appellant knew that the accused could drive vehicles. Since he was not in a

position to deliver the cement blocks as required, the accused has offered that

he could transport the cement blocks in the vehicle, and asked the appellant to

allow him to take it and deliver the goods to his house for which the appellant

had agreed, considering the need of the accused.

In his evidence, the appellant states that the accused wanted to transport some

additional concrete material from another location as well, and he agreed to that

request requiring the accused to pay for the hire for him and allowed the accused

to take the vehicle believing that he will use the vehicle for the purposes he

undertook to use and return it back to him. The appellant has been specific that

he instructed the accused to use the vehicle only for the intended purposes and

bring it back to him. The appellant has expected the vehicle to return around

10.30 in the morning. Since it has not returned, he has attempted to contact the

accused over the phone, but he has not responded. Around 11.30 in the

morning, the accused had answered the phone and had informed that he is in

the police station. When the appellant went to the police station, he has been

Page 6 of 13

informed that the accused has transported logs of timber on his way from his

establishment.

The appellant has claimed that he never used the vehicle for any other hiring

purposes, but only for the needs of his manufacturing facility, and never gave

the vehicle to anyone else but to the driver Hemantha whom he knew from his

childhood, It has been his position that on the day in question, he allowed the

accused to take his vehicle considering his need to finish his building work before

his marriage, as there was no way for him to deliver the cement blocks since his

regular driver was not available.

The appellant has insisted that he was careful throughout not to use his vehicle

for any illegal activities and it was the same on the day of the incident and had

pleaded that the vehicle be released to him.

When the appellant was cross-examined by the prosecution, apart from

suggesting that the appellant willfully allowed the accused to transport timber

in this manner, the evidence of the appellant had not been challenged in any

other material points. Explaining why the said driver has not come to give

evidence on behalf of the appellant, the appellant had stated that because of this

incident, there was an argument with the accused driver and now he is not in

talking terms with him and, therefore, unable to convince him to come and give

evidence at the inquiry on behalf of him.

However, the appellant has called the driver Chandana Hemantha who used to

drive the said vehicle for the appellant to substantiate his evidence. He has

corroborated the evidence of the appellant stating that he used to be the regular

driver of the vehicle whenever his services were needed, and on the day in

question, he could not drive the vehicle as he was ill. He has testified that after

the detention of the vehicle by the police, he came to know that the appellant

has allowed the accused to drive the vehicle in order to deliver the cement blocks

the accused purchased from the appellant. The said Chandana Hemantha has

testified further that he too was an invitee to the wedding of the accused,

Page 7 of 13

therefore, he was aware that the accused needed to get the cement blocks

delivered to his house.

Pronouncing his order on 28-02-2020, the learned Magistrate has determined

that the vehicle owner should establish in the balance of probability that the

vehicle has been used for the commission of the offence without his knowledge

and that he has taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the

commission of the offence.

Having considered the evidence of the appellant, the learned Magistrate has

satisfied himself that the appellant who is the registered owner of the vehicle had

no knowledge of the commissioning of the offence. The relevant finding at page

5 of the order (page 69 of the appeal brief) reads as follows.

.

.

Having determined as above, the learned Magistrate has proceeded to consider

whether the registered owner has taken the necessary precautions to prevent the

crime being committed, and has determined that the registered owner has failed

to take all necessary precautions in that regard and has decided to confiscate

the vehicle on that basis.

In coming to his determination, it appears that the learned Magistrate has been

guided by the following factors.

1. The learned Magistrate has determined that the registered owner has

given the vehicle to the accused without first finding out whether he

has the necessary qualifications to drive the vehicle, whereas, it has

been admitted that the accused had no valid driving license when the

offence was committed.

2. The learned Magistrate has considered the time taken by the registered

owner to initiate inquiries about his vehicle after allowing the vehicle to

Page 8 of 13

leave his workplace around 8.30 in the morning, in order to determine

that the registered owner has not acted with due diligence to inquire

about the whereabouts of his vehicle.

3. The learned Magistrate has found the regular driver of the vehicle

namely, Chandanas evidence unacceptable on the basis that for a

person who is driving another vehicle on regular basis, there is very low

probability of engaging in driving the vehicle of the appellant, and has

determined that even the registered owner had the ability to drive the

vehicle if wanted.

Based on the above conclusions, the learned Magistrate has decided that the

registered owner has failed to satisfy the Court that he took all the necessary

precautions as envisaged by the proviso of section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance.

Accordingly, the learned Magistrate has confiscated the vehicle.

When this order was challenged by way of the impugned revision application

before the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa Holden in Kegalle, the learned

High Court Judge by his order dated 13th May 2020 has refused to issue notice

in that regard to the respondents mentioned in the application.

It has been determined that to allow such an application, there should be

evidence to show that a miscarriage of justice has occurred due to a fundamental

rule of procedure being violated and had concluded that no such violation has

occurred. It has been observed that the learned Magistrate has properly

considered whether all precautions have been taken as provided for in section

40 of the Forest Ordinance and has come to correct conclusions in that regard.

Accordingly, the application invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of the High

Court has been dismissed without notices being issued to the respondents.

It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the evidence

given by the registered owner and the witness called on behalf of him has not

been challenged at material points and the learned Magistrate should have

accepted the evidence, rather than rejecting the evidence on certain

Page 9 of 13

presumptions. He was of the view that the determination where the failure by

the registered owner to call the driver of the vehicle when the offence was

committed to give evidence as a reason to dismiss the evidence of the registered

owner was untenable.

The learned State Counsel who represented the respondents justified the

decision of the learned Magistrate to confiscate the vehicle, as well as that of the

learned High Court Judge not to issue notices, on the basis that both those

decisions are within the required parameters of the law, which need not be

disturbed on appeal.

With the above-mentioned facts and the relevant law in mind, I will now proceed

to consider whether the order pronounced by the learned Magistrate can be

justified.

After having determined that the registered owner of the vehicle had no

participation in the offence committed by the accused, and had no knowledge of

it, the learned Magistrate has proceeded to consider whether the registered

owner has taken necessary precautions to prevent the offence being committed.

It appears from the order that the learned Magistrate has believed the evidence

of the registered owner, but based on the same evidence the determination that

the registered owner has failed to take the necessary steps to prevent the offence

been committed has been reached.

The evidence that the registered owner permitted the driver who was not the

regular driver of the vehicle to take the vehicle to transport cement blocks on

that day had been considered along with the permission given to the driver to

transport some concrete blocks from another location using his lorry, and pay

him a fee, with the fact which has come to light after the detection was made,

where the police has found that the driver had no valid driving license with him.

The learned Magistrate has found fault with the registered owner for allowing a

person who had no valid driving license to use his vehicle to determine that the

registered owner has not been careful enough in that regard. However, I find that

Page 10 of 13

the registered owner of the vehicle has given clear evidence in that regard and

has explained as to the reasons why he allowed the accused to drive his vehicle.

I am of the view that the facts of a matter need to be considered in its totality

and not in the isolation of one fact alone.

The accused has come to the establishment of the registered owner in order to

get the cement blocks he purchased from him transported to his house. The

registered owner has explained the necessity the accused had, and since the

regular driver could not be contacted, he has decided to allow the offer made by

the accused to transport the goods by himself.

The evidence clearly provides that the vehicle was not a vehicle used for hiring

purposes but solely for the purposes of manufacturing and transporting cement

products manufactured by the registered owner. The evidence also clearly shows

that the accused was a fellow villager and well known to the registered owner

and registered owner has known very well that the accused was competent in

driving heavy vehicles as he had often seen him driving buses and lorries

previously.

Under the circumstances, it is hard to justify the learned Magistrates conclusion

that the registered owner was not vigilant enough to inquire whether the accused

possessed a valid driving license. Under a village setting, I am not inclined to

believe that every time when a person who is known to be competent to drive a

vehicle is allowed to drive, the owner of the vehicle should be expected to check

his license. The evidence led in this case clearly shows that the registered owner

believed that the accused had the competency to drive through his past

experiences.

Another reason considered by the learned Magistrate had been that although the

distance that the cement blocks were due to be transported was about 3

kilometers, the owner of the vehicle has waited over three hours to inquire into

the whereabouts of his vehicle. In his evidence, the registered owner had stated

the distance from his house to the accuseds house was about 3 kilometers and

Page 11 of 13

it takes about 15 minutes to get there. He has stated that the vehicle left his

place around 8.30 in the morning and he came to know about the arrest of the

vehicle around 11.30 am. If one considers that piece of evidence in its isolation,

the determination of the learned Magistrate can be justified. However, the

evidence was that the registered owner allowed the accused to transport

additional material, obviously from another location to his house. There is no

evidence to establish at what time the detection was made. One also has to

consider the time that may take for a person to unload the cement blocks, and

if the person has taken some other materials in the vehicle to unload them as

well. The evidence of the registered owner had been that he waited until 10.30

in the morning, which was about 2 hours after the vehicle left his establishment

and attempted to call the accused because of his failure to return. I do not find

waiting for about 2 hours and begin to worry about the vehicle as an unusual

delay on the part of the registered owner. The evidence of the registered owner

had been that although he attempted to contact the accused from 10.30 in the

morning, he answered the phone around 11.30 and informed that the vehicle is

in police custody. I find no reason to find fault with the registered owner as

observed by the learned Magistrate.

The learned Magistrate has doubted the evidence that the registered owner had

no permanent driver but utilized the services of a driver who worked in another

vehicle if and when he needed to use the vehicle. I do not find anything unusual

in such a practice under the given circumstances. The registered owner has given

clear evidence that his vehicle was not used for regular hiring purposes and used

the vehicle only when necessary. Under the circumstances, paying for a

permanent driver would not be feasible.

The learned Magistrate has found the evidence of the regular driver of the vehicle

where he says that he has seen the registered owner of the vehicle driving it as

a vital contradiction in relation to the evidence led at the inquiry.

Page 12 of 13

I am of the view that in itself does not provide a reason to conclude that the

registered owner has failed to take necessary precautions to prevent an offence

being committed in terms of the Forest Ordinance.

I am of the view that after finding that the registered owner had no knowledge or

connection to the offence committed by the accused in the case, the learned

Magistrate should have taken a more pragmatic view in analyzing the evidence

led in this case in order to find whether the registered owner has taken all

necessary precautions as stated in the proviso of section 40(1) of the Forest Act.

When considering the evidence led in an inquiry of this nature, such evidence

has to be considered in its totality given the relevant facts and the circumstances

unique to each situation. I am of the view that if the evidence was considered in

its totality, there were ample reasons for the learned Magistrate to release the

vehicle.

In the case of Sadi Banda Vs. Officer In Charge of Nortonbridge Police Station

(2014) 1 SLR 33, it was held by Malani Gunaratne, J.;

I am of the view before making the order of confiscation the learned

Magistrate should have taken into consideration, value of the timber

transported, no allegations prior to this incident that the lorry had been used

for any illegal purpose, that the appellant or the accused are habitual

offenders in this nature and had no previous convictions and the acceptance

of the fact that the appellant did not have any knowledge about the

transporting of the timber without a permit.

In the matter under consideration as well, if the totality of evidence was

considered in the correct perspective, there cannot be any justification for the

order where the vehicle belonging to the appellant was confiscated.

I find when the notice was refused by the learned High Court Judge of Kegalle in

this regard, the learned High Court Judge too had thought it fit to justify the

order pronounced by the learned Magistrate of Warakapola by considering the

Page 13 of 13

same reasons. I am of the view that the refusal to issue notice cannot be justified

for the reasons considered as above.

Accordingly, I set aside the order dated 28-02-2020 by the learned Magistrate of

Warakapola and the order dated 13-05-2020 by the learned High Court Judge

of the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa Holden in Kegalle, as both the

orders cannot be allowed to stand.

I order that the vehicle numbered SP GA-5320 shall be released to the appellant.

The appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgement to the High

Court of Kegalle for information, and to the Magistrates Court of Warakapola for

necessary compliance.

I agree.
