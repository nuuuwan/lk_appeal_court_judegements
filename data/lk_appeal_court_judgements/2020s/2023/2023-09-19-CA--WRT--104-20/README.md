The petitioner filed this application seeking to quash the order of the 1st to

4th respondents dated 2019.09.05 by way of a Writ of Certiorari, to issue

a Writ of Mandamus to the 1st to 9th respondents directing them to hold

proceedings under Section 25 of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Ordinance) regarding the

application of the 10th respondent, and to prohibit the 1st to 9th

respondents from taking further steps upon the same order dated

05.09.2019 by a Writ of Prohibition.

Page 3 of 14

The 10th respondent filed his statement of objections. At the hearing, the

learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned counsel for the 10th

respondent made oral submissions. After the arguments were concluded,

parties were allowed to file only the judicial authorities cited in the course

of their oral submissions. Only on behalf of the 10th respondent the

relevant judicial authorities were submitted and the court considered the

said judicial authorities. On behalf of the petitioner, no judicial authority

was submitted but a written submission has been tendered.

The order that the petitioner seeks to quash by way of Writ of Certiorari is

the order made by the Debt Conciliation Board (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Board) that the Board has the jurisdiction to hear and

determine the application preferred by the 10th Respondent. This order

was made in respect of the preliminary objection taken by the petitioner of

this writ application that the Debt Conciliation Board does not have the

jurisdiction to proceed with the application of the 10th respondent because

the property described in the application of the 10th respondent had been

transferred to the petitioner by the 10th respondent by Deed bearing No.

4142 dated 26.04.2018 marked P-8.

Admittedly, the Transfer Deed bearing No. 4142 was executed on 26th April

2018, after the 10th respondent preferred the application to the Debt

Conciliation Board. The Chairman of the Debt Conciliation Board has

stated in her order that the Debt Conciliation Board has jurisdiction to

hear the application preferred by the 10th respondent because the Transfer

Deed bearing No. 4142 has been executed after the said application was

received by the Debt Conciliation Board. Accordingly, the preliminary

objection was overruled. It is also stated in the said order that the 10th

respondent has not pleaded any relief against the Transfer Deed and thus

the acknowledgement of the Deed P-8 by the 10th respondent is merely a

technical error in the proceedings of the Debt Conciliation Board. The said

Page 4 of 14

observation had to be made because, according to the proceedings dated

23.11.2018, the Debtor (10th respondent) admitted the fact that the

Creditor (the petitioner) registered a Transfer Deed and the preliminary

objection was based on that admission. The 10th respondents position was

that he had no connection to the Transfer Deed marked P-8.

The main contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner was that, the

Debt Conciliation Board decided without any basis that the aforesaid

acknowledgement of the Deed, P-8 is merely a technical error in the

proceedings. In addition, the learned counsel contended that if P-8 is a

fraudulent deed and the 10th respondent has no connection to the said

deed, the said issue should be resolved first, and then only the Debt

Conciliation Board gets jurisdiction to hear the application. The learned

counsel for the petitioner also urged to consider the serious legal issue

involved in the impugned order, disregarding the delay in filing this

application.

The position of the 10th respondent is that he has no connection to the

Transfer Deed bearing No. 4142. The learned counsel for the 10th

respondent advanced the following arguments substantiating the position

that the Debt Conciliation Board has jurisdiction to hear and determine

the application preferred by the 10th respondent.

I. Even if it is assumed that the Transfer Deed bearing

No.4142 has been duly executed, the Debt Conciliation

Board has the jurisdiction to ascertain whether the Transfer

Deed is in fact an outright transfer or a mortgage.

II. According to Section 35(4), a Transfer Deed executed

without the written sanction of the Board after the Notice is

registered under Section 35(2) is null and void, and thus the

Page 5 of 14

Deed P-8 is null and void, so the Debt Conciliation Board

has the jurisdiction to hear the application.

III. The petitioner seeks to quash the order dated 05.09.2019

on the basis that the Debt Conciliation Board has no

jurisdiction to hear the application. At the same time, the

petitioner seeks to issue a writ of mandamus to the 1st to 9th

respondents directing them to hold proceedings under

Section 25 of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance. Thus,

prayers (b) and (c) of the petition is contradictory.

IV. If a writ of certiorari is issued quashing the impugned order,

steps taken in terms of Section 29 of the Debt Conciliation

Ordinance become futile.

V. According to Section 54 of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance,

the petitioner had the remedy of making an application

within three months to review its order by the Board, but

the petitioner failed to do so. When an alternative remedy is

available, the petitioner cannot invoke the writ jurisdiction

of this court without recourse to the said remedy.

VI. The petitioner cannot maintain this application due to the

undue delay.

In support of above argument (I), the case of W.D Dharmasiri

Karunaratne and Another V. Debt Conciliation Board of Colombo and

Others CA(Writ) 463/10 decided on 15th June 2012 was submitted on

behalf of the 10th respondent. In this case, the power of the Debt

Conciliation Board to decide whether a deed is a transfer or a mortgage

has been discussed. Further, in support of the above argument (III), the

case of W. Thenuki Pehansa de Silva V. Kusala Fernando, The

Page 6 of 14

Principal, Princess of Wales' College, Moratuwa and Others-

CA/Writ/103/2019 decided on 17th December 2019 was submitted.

Now, I proceed to consider the aforesaid arguments with the arguments

advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner to decide whether the

Debt Conciliation Board has the jurisdiction to hear and determine the

application filed by the 10th respondent.

Argument - V

Without recourse to the remedy in terms of Section 54 of the Debt

Conciliation Ordinance, the petitioner cannot invoke the jurisdiction of

this court.

Learned Counsel for the 10th respondent submitted the case of Niroshana

and Another V. Gunasekera and Another (2006) 3 Sri L.R. 152 in

substantiating his argument that when there is an alternative remedy,

without recourse to that remedy, the petitioner cannot invoke the

jurisdiction of this court.

In reply, the learned counsel for the petitioner contended that Section 54

is not there to review an order of this nature but to review an order such

as the quantum of the amount to be paid by the debtor. The learned

counsel for the petitioner also submitted that it cannot be the intention of

the legislature to give powers to the Board to review the dismissal of any

application by the same Board.

Section 54(1) of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance reads as follows:

The Board may, of its own motion or on application made by any

person interested, within three months from the making of an order

by the Board dismissing an application, or granting a certificate, or

approving a settlement, or before the payment of the compounded

Page 7 of 14

debt has been completed, review any order passed by it and pass

such other in reference thereto as it thinks fit.

In the aforesaid case of Niroshana and Another V. Gunasekera and Another,

the petitioner has not sought to review the order granting a certificate to

the debtors in terms of Section 54 of the Ordinance before invoking the

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. Following the decision in Bhambra vs.

Director of Customs and Others (2002) 3 Sri L.R. 240, it was held by the

Court of Appeal that the failure of the petitioner to resort to an alternative

remedy provided by law precludes the court from intervening and

exercising its discretionary powers.

In the aforesaid case, an inquiry commenced before the Debt Conciliation

Board, and the respondent (debtor) offered to pay to the petitioner

(creditor) a sum of Rs.700,000 in settlement of the debt, which was

Rs. 350,000. This offer was rejected by the petitioners, and they demanded

Rs. 10 million for settlement. The Board made an order accepting the offer

of the respondent as a reasonable offer and granted a certificate under

Section 32(2). So, in the said case, both parties admitted the jurisdiction

of the Debt Conciliation Board and expected a decision from the Board

regarding their dispute. Section 54 provides room for the parties who

invoked the jurisdiction of the Debt Conciliation Board and obtained an

order. Such a party could make an application to review a decision of the

Board under this section. The petitioner in this application maintained his

position from the beginning that the Board has no jurisdiction to hear the

application filed by the 10th respondent. At the very first instance that he

came before the Board, the learned counsel for the petitioner raised this

objection as a preliminary objection before the Debt Conciliation Board.

So, the party who took up the position that the Board has no jurisdiction

to hear the matter, cannot make an application to review its order by

exercising the powers given by the Ordinance. Therefore, to canvass an

Page 8 of 14

order regarding the jurisdiction of the Debt Conciliation Board, I hold that

the petitioner can directly come to this court by way of a writ.

Argument - III

Prayers (b) and (c) of the petition is contradictory

The prayer (b) reads as follows: Quash the order of the 1st 4th

Respondents dated 2019.09.05 by way of Writ of Certiorari. The prayer

(c) is, Issue Writ of Mandamus to the 1st 9th Respondents directing them

to hold proceedings under Section 25 of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance

regarding the application of the 10th Respondent.

If the relief prayed for in the prayer (b) is granted, the order of the Debt

Conciliation Board that the Board has jurisdiction to inquire in to this

matter must be quashed. That is, the petitioner seeks an order asserting

that the Board has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the 10th

respondents application. By the relief prayed for in the prayer (c), the

petitioner seeks from this court an order directing 1st to 9th Respondents

to exercise the jurisdiction of the Board and make an order in terms of

Section 25 of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance. Therefore, as correctly

pointed out by the learned counsel for the 10th respondent, those two

reliefs are contrary to each other and thus both reliefs cannot be granted

together.

However, this court can grant one relief from the aforesaid two reliefs

prayed for in the prayers (b) and (c). Hence, there is no legal bar to

maintain the instant application.

Page 9 of 14

Argument - VI

The petitioner cannot maintain this application because of the undue

delay.

The instant application has filed nearly nine months after the impugned

order dated 05.09.2019. So, there is a delay in filing the application.

Stating his illness and inability to get ready with the application due to the

Covid -19 pandemic situation, the petitioner urged to consider the delay

as an excusable delay.

The learned counsel for the 10th respondent contended that the petitioner,

not the learned counsel, has intentionally misled this Court in explaining

his medical condition in order to justify the delay.

As it is not a very long delay and the issue pertaining to this application is

a legal issue with regard to the jurisdiction of the Debt Conciliation Board,

I decide to consider the merits of this application without dismissing it on

the ground of delay in making the application.

Argument - IV

If a writ of certiorari is issued quashing the impugned order, steps taken

in terms of Section 29 of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance becomes futile.

It is my view that whatever steps that were taken by the Board, if they were

taken without jurisdiction, those steps could not be allowed to stand. This

is not a situation where the issuance of the writ becomes futile. Therefore,

the aforesaid futility is not a reason to consider in issuing or not issuing

the writ of certiorari prayed for in the petition.

Page 10 of 14

Argument - I

The Debt Conciliation Board has the jurisdiction to ascertain whether in

fact the Transfer Deed is an Outright Transfer or a Mortgage.

The learned counsel for the 10th respondent pointed out that according to

paragraph 13 of the petition, the 1st to 4th respondents have considered

the acknowledgement of the Deed bearing No. 4142 as a technical error,

acted abusing their powers, and refused to dismiss the application of the

10th respondent on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. However, the learned

counsel contended further that even if the Deed bearing No.4142 is

assumed to be a duly executed transfer deed, according to Section 21A of

the Debt Conciliation Ordinance, the Debt Conciliation Board has the

jurisdiction to ascertain whether the transfer deed is in fact an outright

transfer or a mortgage. Therefore, he submitted that even under the said

circumstances, the Board has the jurisdiction to hear and determine this

matter.

The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner was that the

property subject to this application had been transferred to the petitioner

by the 10th respondent after the institution of the instant application and

thus the Debt Conciliation Board has no jurisdiction to hear this matter.

The learned Counsel submitted further that according to the proceedings

dated 23.11.2018, the 10th respondent firmly acknowledged the execution

of the Deed bearing No. 4142 and he has not taken a single step to rectify

the said acknowledgement if it is wrongly recorded. In the circumstances,

the learned counsel for the petitioner contended that it is erroneous to

hold by the Board on 05.09.2019 that it is a technical error made on the

part of the proceedings.

Page 11 of 14

I am of the view that when the 10th respondent states that he has no

connection to the Transfer Deed bearing No. 4142, there is no purpose in

ascertaining whether the deed had been executed as an outright transfer

or mortgage. According to the position taken up by the 10th respondent,

first, it should be decided whether, in fact, the 10th respondent transferred

the property by executing Deed bearing No. 4142 or whether the said deed

is not an act of the 10th respondent. However, it is to be noted that this

issue must be decided by a Court with competent jurisdiction to determine

that issue and not by the Debt Conciliation Board.

Anyhow, the question of ascertaining whether in fact the transfer deed is

an outright transfer or a mortgage does not arise, as the 10th respondent

has taken up the position that the said deed is null and void.

Argument - II

Transfer Deed executed without the written sanction of the Board after the

Notice registered under Section 35(2) is null and void

The learned Counsel for the 10th respondent contended that the 10th

respondent does not admit the execution of the Deed bearing No. 4142,

however, even if it is assumed that the said deed had been executed, the

Transfer Deed executed after the notice issued under Section 35(1) and

registered under Section 35(2) of the Ordinance is null and void.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the petitioner was that since the

10th respondent transferred the property subject to this application to the

petitioner, the Board has no jurisdiction to hear this application.

Page 12 of 14

The relevant subsections of Section 35 read as follows:

(1) Where, at any time in the course of proceedings before the Board, any

land in respect of which a notice under section 25 (1) (c) or section 26

(1) (c) has not already been registered is disclosed to be the property

of the debtor, the Board may cause a notice in the prescribed form to

be delivered or transmitted to the proper Registrar of Lands for

registration, setting out the prescribed particulars relating to that land

and stating that proceedings under the Ordinance have commenced

in respect of the debts owed by that debtor or of certain of such debts,

as the case may be.

(2) Every notice under subsection (1) or under section 25 (1) (c) or section

26 (1) (c) shall be registered by the Registrar in the manner

provided in the Registration of Documents Ordinance for the

registration of an instrument affecting or relating to land and shall be

deemed for such purpose to be an instrument affecting or relating to

each land the prescribed particulars of which are set out in such

notice; and the provisions of that Ordinance shall apply accordingly

(3)

(4) Every alienation, transfer, lease, mortgage, or other transaction

whatsoever, of or affecting any immovable property of the debtor

made or executed by him without the written sanction of the Board,

at any time while a notice registered under subsection (2) is in

force in respect of such property, shall be void and of no effect.

(Emphasis added)

Page 13 of 14

The following facts are not in dispute:

I. The 10th respondent made an application to the Board based

on Mortgage Bonds bearing numbers 3621, 3669, 3699 and

3841.

II. On the said mortgage bonds, the 10th respondent obtained

a loan facility.

III. The property mortgaged by those mortgage bonds is the

same property described in the schedule to the Transfer

Deed bearing No. 4142.

IV. The notice under Section 35 has been registered in Folio

F 270/82 on 2018.02.08.

V. The Deed bearing No. 4142 was executed on 26th April 2018

after the aforesaid notice had been registered on 08th

February 2018.

It is apparent from the photocopy of the registered notice filed of record

that the notice under Section 35 of the Ordinance has been registered in

Folio F 270/82 on 2018.02.08. The said photocopy of the registered notice

is filed of record at the 7th page after the proceedings of Debt Conciliation

Board meeting dated 2018.11.23. The said registration is not transpired

from the land registry extracts attached with the Mortgage Bond No. 3841,

marked P-5, because the said extracts have been obtained in 2017.11.29,

prior to the notice being registered

In terms of Section 35(4) of the Ordinance, every alienation, transfer, lease,

mortgage, or other transaction whatsoever, of or affecting any immovable

property of the debtor made or executed by him without the written

sanction of the Board, at any time while a notice registered under

subsection (2) is in force, the said instrument is null and void. If it is

assumed that the Deed bearing No.4142 is duly executed, the written

Page 14 of 14

sanction of the Board has not been obtained to execute the deed and thus

the Transfer Deed bearing No. 4142, which has been exected while a notice

registered under subsection 35(2) is in force, is null and void. Therefore,

the decision of the Debt Conciliation Board to overrule the preliminary

objection raised on the ground that the relevant property had been

transferred to the petitioner by a duly executed deed is correct.

Hence, I find no reason to exercise the writ jurisdiction of this court with

regard to the instant application. Accordingly, the application for writs

prayed for by the petitioner is dismissed without costs.
