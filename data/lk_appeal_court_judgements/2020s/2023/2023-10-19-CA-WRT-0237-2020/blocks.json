The names of candidates who were elected to Parliament were published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2187/26 dated 08-08-2020 (P10) by the Election Commission under Section 62 of the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 01 of 1981. The Petitioner failed to secure sufficient votes to be elected to Parliament. The Petitioner states that the preferential votes received by the Petitioner should be 53954 whereas it was erroneously declared that the Petitioner received only 53261 preferential votes. In those circumstances, the Petitioner is seeking, inter-alia, Writs of Certiorari, quashing the decision of the Election Commission that the Petitioner has received only 2397 preferential votes from the polling division of Kolonne in the electoral division of Ratnapura and a Writ of Mandamus directing the Election Commissioner to recount the preferential votes of the counting center No. 105.",
