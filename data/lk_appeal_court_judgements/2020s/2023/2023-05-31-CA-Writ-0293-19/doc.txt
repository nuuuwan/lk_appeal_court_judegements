S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

By this Writ Application, the Petitioner is challenging the nominations of the 5th and 6th

Respondents done by the Petitioners mother as her successors under and in terms of Chapter

VII of the Land Development Ordinance, No. 19 of 1935 (as amended) (hereinafter referred to

as the Ordinance). As evident by the documents marked as P2 and P2 (a) the father of the

Petitioner, Punchirala had been selected on 21.09.1979 in terms of the Sale of State Lands

3

(Special Provisions) Law, No. 43 of 1973 of the National State Assembly, to alienate the paddy

lands which are subject to this Application. Even though, he had been selected to issue permits

he had died on 29.10.1980 before issuing the Permits. After the demise of Punchirala in terms

of section 19 (2) of the Ordinance, on 12.12.1984 Permits (marked as P7 and P8) and thereafter,

on 17.01.2002 and on 29.02.2002 in terms of section 19 (4) the Grants (marked as P5 and P6)

had been issued in the name of Punchiralas widow who was the Petitioners mother,

Nandawathi.

The position of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner is that upon the death of

Punchirala the Petitioner being his eldest son, in terms of the Ordinance should be nominated

as the successor of Punchirala. In the Permits marked as P7 and P8 which were prepared to be

issued to Punchirala before his demise naming Punchirala as the permits-holder and in the Land

Ledgers, marked as P7(a) and P 8(a) Punchiralas name had been deleted and the name of

Punchiralas widow who was the mother of the Petitioner, Nandawathi had been written and

Nandawathi had nominated the 5th to 6th Respondents who are the siblings of the Petitioner as

successors to the lands. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted to Court that the

mother of the Petitioner, under the undue influence of the 5th and 6th Respondents, had

submitted the nomination papers to the authorities by which the 5th and 6th Respondents have

been nominated as the successors of the mother and accordingly, the name of the 5th and 6th

Respondents have been entered in the Land Ledgers. The learned Counsel appearing for the

Petitioner argued that in terms of the Ordinance, the mother of the Petitioner had only the life

interest of Punchirala and therefore, she was not entitled to nominate the 5th and 6th

Respondents as the successors to the subject matter. On that premise, the learned Counsel for

the Petitioner sought to issue a writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st to 3rd

Respondents to name the 5th and 6th Respondents as the successors of the subject matter and

writs of Mandamus directing the 1st to 3rd Respondents to name the Petitioner as the successor

4

of the subject lands and directing the 4th Respondent to delete the 5th and 6th Respondents

names in the Land Ledgers maintained in the Land Registry. In the Petition to this Application,

no reliefs have been sought against naming the mother of the Petitioner as the Permit-holder in

the Permits marked as P7 and P8 and the Grantee in the Grants marked as P5 and P6.

The position of the learned Counsel appearing for the Respondents is that in terms of the Sale

of State Lands (Special Provisions) Law after Puncirala had been selected to alienate the

subject matter of the action, the Permits marked as P7 and P8 had been prepared but before the

Permits were issued to him he had died. Therefore, in the Permits and in the Ledgers maintained

by the 1st to 4th Respondents in respect of the subject lands were altered by entering the name

of Punchiralas widow, Nandawathi as the Permit-holder. Thereafter, the Grants marked as P5

and P6 were also issued in the name of Nandawathi. The argument of the learned Counsel

appeared for the Respondents was that since Nandawathi was the Permit-holder and thereafter

the Grantee of the lands in terms of sections 19 (2) and 19 (4) of the Ordinance respectively,

under Chapter VII of the Ordinance she had a right to nominate a successor and therefore, the

nomination of the 5th and 6th Respondents by Nandawathi as her successor is according to the

provisions of the Ordinance.

Punchirala died on 29.10.1980 and the permits had been issued to his widow, Nandawathi after

Punchiralas death. Therefore, the Court can be satisfied that even though the Permits were

prepared to be issued to Punchirala, before the Permits were issued, he had died and therefore,

the name of Punchirala had been deleted in the Permits and in the Land Ledgers maintained by

the 1st to 3rd Respondents and the name of Nandawathi who was the widow of Punchirala had

been entered deleting Punchiralas name. Therefore, the Grants also were issued in the name

of Nandawathi. Under the above-stated circumstances, the Court can be satisfied that the Grants

marked P5 and P6 were issued to Nandawahi and after issuing the Grants she had nominated

the 5th and 6th Respondents as her successors in terms of the Ordinance and therefore, the 1st

5

4th Respondents have acted according to the provisions of the Ordinance. Under the said

circumstance, I conclude that the Petitioner is not entitled to the reliefs sought in the Writ

Application. Therefore, I dismiss the writ Application without costs.

Application dismissed.
