The petitioners in this application are seeking a mandate of Certiorari

quashing the decisions of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd respondents to demolish the

petitioners building and a mandate of a writ of Certiorari quashing the lease

agreement between the 1st respondent and 8th respondent marked P12, P6

and P8 C.

The facts as submitted in the petition are briefly as follows:

The 1st petitioner was born and permanently resided in the Kahatagasdigiliya

area. As that area was affected by civil war, the petitioners occupied state

land at the place mentioned in the caption of the petition on which the

questioned building was constructed. The land was earlier occupied by one

4

4

P.A. Sominona. The petitioner paid a certain sum of money to her and

obtained possession of the land and built a house in it and occupied it since

1994. The said Sominona had paid rates to the Municipal Council of

Anuradhapura (the first respondent).

The Divisional Secretary of Nagenahira Nuwaragam Palatha instituted

proceedings in the Magistrate's Court of Anuradhapura to evict the petitioners

in terms of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No 7 of 1979. The

Learned Magistrate of Anuradhapura, in the case bearing No. 29945, decided

against the petitioner. The 1st petitioner then preferred a revision application

to the Provincial High Court.

The petitioner has built a house in Lot 6 of P4. Later the 2nd petitioner, the

son of the 1st Petitioner, built a house on the said land.

By letter dated 27.01.2006, the 6th respondent informed the petitioner to

remove the building bearing no. 104/36A since the said construction is

unauthorised and was further informed that if the petitioner failed to remove

his unauthorised construction, the 6th and 7th respondents would take steps

to demolish the said building in terms of the Urban Development Authority

Act No. 41 of 1978.

The petitioner thereafter took steps to obtain the approval of 1st respondent.

Then the 6th respondent did not proceed to take action in terms of the Urban

Development Authority Act.

By letter dated 29.03.2007, the 6th respondent informed the petitioner to

remove the building assessment No. 104/36 A, since it is unauthorized, and

further informed that if the petitioner failed to remove his unauthorized

construction, the 6th and 7th respondents would take steps to remove the

building in terms of the Urban Development Authority Act. The petitioner

again informed the 6th respondent that he had applied for the approval of the

1st respondent.

On 11.12.2012, the petitioner was served a notice under section 42A (2) of the

Municipal Council Ordinance, which notice contained that the petitioner's

building bearing no. 104/36A should be demolished within 14 days of the said

notice. That notice was produced marked P12. Further, the petitioner states

that the construction was not an unauthorized construction.

The petitioners are seeking a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st,

2nd and 3rdrespondents to demolish the building referred to in P12 and a writ

of certiorari to quash the lease agreements of the 8th respondent marked P6

and P8 C.

The 1st respondent filed objections and stated that the petitioner had not

obtained any authority to build the constructions in question. The petitioners

only obtained an application and there was no approval for the construction

of a building by the 1st respondent. The 6th respondent has admitted that the

letters marked P9A, P9B and P9C were issued to the 1st petitioner. However,

the 6th respondent further stated that P9C was issued based on documents

that were submitted by the 1st petitioner at the site inspection. 6th and 7th

respondents also deny that they gave permits to the petitioners to construct a

building.

It is common ground that the land on which the petitioners' constructions

stand is state land. The petitioner is not a permit holder or a grantee for that

state land. Therefore, the petitioner has no legal right, title, or interest in the

subject land.

The action instituted by the 4th respondent under the provisions of the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 was decided against the

petitioners. Even though the petitioners' position is that the decision of the

Learned Magistrate was set aside by the Provincial High Court, no certified

copy of such decision is produced by the petitioner.

The petitioner has not submitted at least a copy of a permit issued to him for

the construction of a building. If the petitioner has constructed a building

having a permit to do so, he should have also possessed a certificate of

conformity from the Municipal Council. However, the petitioner has failed to

produce a certificate of conformity or any letter to that effect issued by the

Municipal Council. The position of the 1st and 6th respondents is that the

building constructed by the petitioner is an unauthorized construction. The

petitioner has failed to produce evidence to show that he has ever obtained a

permit from the 1st respondent for the construction. The petitioners have not

followed the law in this regard.

In the case of Dankotuwa Estate Co., Ltd vs The Tea Controller 42 NLR 197,

Soertsz J stated as follows;

The leading case on this point is that of Rex v. Electricity Commissioners

[ 1 (1924) 1 K. B. 171.] Atkin L.J., as he then was, discussing the writs

of prohibition and certiorari said, "the operation of the writs has

extended to control the proceedings of bodies which do not claim to be

or would not be recognized as Courts of Justice. Whenever anybody of

persons having legal authority to determine questions affecting the

rights of subjects and having the duty to act judicially, act in excess of

legal authority, they are subject to the controlling jurisdiction exercised

by these writs". Slesser L.J. in adopting and analysing this dictum

in Rex v. The London County Council 1 said "Atkin L.J. lays down four

conditions under which a rule for certiorari may issue. He says: '

wherever anybody of persons (first) having legal authority, (secondly) to

determine questions affecting the rights of subjects, (thirdly) having the

duty to act judicially, (fourthly) act in excess of their legal authority,

they are subject to the controlling jurisdiction exercised by these writs'".

Other very eminent Judges have expressed themselves in similar terms.

Admittedly the subject land is State Land. The petitioners have no permit or

a grant for that State Land. The Magistrate of Anuradhapura has decided

against the 1st petitioner in an action instituted by the 4th respondent to evict

7

7

the petitioner from that State Land. The petitioners have not obtained a

permit from the Municipal Council of Anuradhapura to build on that land.

The Petitioners have not shown that they have legal rights, which are affected

by the decision of the respondents, to obtain the reliefs sought in this

application. The respondents have not acted outside the law.

In view of the above circumstances, the decision of the first, second and third

respondents is not outside the law or not ultra-vires, and they have not

committed any error in law.

Anuradhapura Municipal Council has given a 17 perch State Land to the 8th

respondent on a lease to build a house. The 8th respondent was recommended

to be given State Land to build a house in 1993 during the Gam Udawa project

in the Anuradhapura area. The petitioners now seek to quash a lease given to

the 8th respondent in 1994. This inordinate delay was not explained at all by

the petitioners. In any event the petitioners do not have a legal right to ask for

the cancellation of these lease agreements.

The petitioners' application has no merit. The application of the petitioners is

dismissed without costs.
