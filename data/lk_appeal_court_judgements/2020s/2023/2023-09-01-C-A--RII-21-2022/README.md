Order

The 04th respondent (although the Journal Entry of 27.01.2023 says 04th and 05th

respondents) (E. R. Gnanam) has moved to dismiss the application of the

3 | R I I 2 1 2 0 2 2 J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e M a y a d u n n e C o r e a O r d e r o n P r e l i m i n a r y o b j e c t i o n s o f t h e 0 4 t h r e s p o n d e n t

petitioner (National Savings Bank) and or to dissolve the interim order (as per

paragraph d(ii) of the prayer, that the petitioner has the right to be heard in these

winding up proceedings) by filing a motion on 20.01.2023, which was supported

on 27.01.2023.

The learned counsel for the 04th respondent and for the petitioner were

extensively heard and both parties have filed written submissions.

The 03rd respondent (Mercantile Investments and Finance PLC) and the 06th

respondent, (Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka) have informed on

that date itself that they do not file objections to petitioners application.

The grievance of the petitioner, whose position is that in the national interest it

stepped into manage Entrust Securities PLC, is that, the learned Judge of the

Commercial High Court by order dated 20.09.2022 in case No.

CHC/83/2021/CO prevented it from appearing.

The said part of the order reads,

Winding up order has been made on this case on 17th June 2022.

Therefore, now Liquidator has to be appointed and the learned counsel

has no status quo to appear for the company sought to be wound up.

Therefore date for objections is granted regarding two applications made

by Dr. Harsha Cabral and the other application made by the petitioner

[petitioner in that case is HNB Finance] No status quo to appear learned

counsel Mr. Eraj de Silva for the company sought to be wound up, as the

winding up order has been already made.

It was on the above order that this court issued notice and the above interim

order.

The 04th respondent wants to dismiss the notice [this application] and or dissolve

the interim order mainly on the following basis,

4 | R I I 2 1 2 0 2 2 J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e M a y a d u n n e C o r e a O r d e r o n P r e l i m i n a r y o b j e c t i o n s o f t h e 0 4 t h r e s p o n d e n t

(01) As per the proxy, NSB does not appear qua NSB but as managerial agent

of Entrust Securities PLC (formerly Ceylinco Sri Ram Securities Ltd.,)

(02) As a Liquidator has been appointed NSB has no status to appear

(03) The Liquidator is in charge of the company sought to be wound up

(04) Hence if NSB too is allowed to appear there will be two managerial bodies,

which is not envisaged in law

In this regard the 04th respondent basically cites two cases. They are,

(i) Okanda Finance Pvt Ltd., vs. The Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue and others C. A. Writ 93/2008 and

(ii) Re Union Accident Insurance Co. Ltd., (1972) 1 All E R 1105

According to the written submissions of the 04th respondent, what was decided

in (and relevant to this case) in the first case decided by Chithrasiri J., is as

follows,

It is important to note that the business of a company comes to a

standstill when a winding up order is made. Board of Directors of such a

company then ceases to function. Then the liquidators take over the

management and the control of the company. Basically their duty is to

distribute the assets of the company. Such a distribution of assets are to

be made according to law and it should take place in the manner stipulated

in law. As such, a company under liquidation cannot perform or act on its

own. In this instance, application by the liquidators to intervene into this

case has also been refused. Therefore, it is clear that the petitioner

company in this instance is not entitled in law to proceed with this action

in view of Section 279 (1) of the Company Act No.7 of 2007. Moreover,

Section 290 of the Companies Act also stipulates that the liquidator or the

provisional liquidator shall take into his control, of the property and things

in action, to which the company is entitled to when a winding up order

has been made. Furthermore, under Section 292 (1) of the Companies Act

5 | R I I 2 1 2 0 2 2 J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e M a y a d u n n e C o r e a O r d e r o n P r e l i m i n a r y o b j e c t i o n s o f t h e 0 4 t h r e s p o n d e n t

the liquidator in a winding up by the Court shall have the power to bring

or to defend any action or other legal proceedings in the name and/or on

behalf of the company. Those two provisions in the Companies Act also

show that the liquidators are the persons in authority to take over the

control of all matters on behalf of a company under liquidation and

therefore the company cannot proceed with an action under its registered

name. In the circumstances, it is clear that the law does not allow the

petitioner company to proceed with this action. [paragraph 22 of written

submissions]

The above passage does not say anything with regard to an appearance in a case

or a right to be heard, which is the main and perhaps the only grievance of NSB.

The 04th respondent has not quoted any part of the English case. But what was

basically decided in that case was,

A provisional liquidator cannot be appointed on a baseless petition.

There are two conditions to be met. The first was that the petition must

disclose a prima facie case, the second was that there were circumstances

that require that a provisional liquidator ought to be appointed. The

circumstances were not limited. The fact that the petition was not opposed

was one of them. In this case, a prima facie case was established because

it was shown that the company could not meet the level of solvency

required of insurance companies by statute. The circumstances here

required that a provisional liquidator ought to be appointed, and it was in

the interest of the public in the fact that sums retained by brokers

amounting to a large sum of andpound;300,000 be collected from them. A

provisional liquidator was correctly appointed.

It is inappropriate to limit the exercise of the power to appoint a provisional

liquidator by restricting it to fixed categories or classes of circumstances

or fact, as commercial affairs are complex and circumstances will vary

6 | R I I 2 1 2 0 2 2 J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e M a y a d u n n e C o r e a O r d e r o n P r e l i m i n a r y o b j e c t i o n s o f t h e 0 4 t h r e s p o n d e n t

greatly.

Nevertheless, before a winding up order is made, a companys Board of

directors retained certain residuary powers which included the authority

to instruct solicitors and counsels to oppose the petition, notwithstanding

the appointment of provisional liquidators to the company.

Plowman J explained the twofold approach that he proposed to adopt:

There are two matters though, which seem to be relevant for me to

consider. The first is whether the department has made out a good prima

facie case for a winding-up on the hearing of the petition. Any views I

express about the matter now are of course provisional only because I am

not trying the petition at the present time. If the department has not made

out a good prima facie case for a winding-up order then clearly I think it

would not be right to appoint a provisional liquidator. On the other hand,

if the department has made out a good prima facie case for a winding-up

order then the second matter for my consideration arises, namely, whether

in the circumstances of this case it is right that a provisional liquidator

should have been appointed.

With respect, it does not cover the situation at hand, the four main propositions

of the 04th respondent.

Another argument of the 04th respondent is that NSB wants a right to be heard

on what?

This court does not think that this is a sound argument.

It was said in the case of Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works (1863) 14 CB(NS)

180, as far back as 1863, that,

I apprehend that a tribunal which is by law invested to affect the

property of one of Her Majestys subjects, is bound to give such subject an

7 | R I I 2 1 2 0 2 2 J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e M a y a d u n n e C o r e a O r d e r o n P r e l i m i n a r y o b j e c t i o n s o f t h e 0 4 t h r e s p o n d e n t

opportunity of being heard before it proceeds: and that that rule is of

universal application, and founded upon the plainest principles of justice.

[190]

I cannot conceive any harm that could happen to the district board from

hearing the party before they subjected him to a loss so serious as the

demolition of his house; but I can conceive a great many advantages which

might arise in the way of public order, by way of doing substantial justice,

and in the way of fulfilling the purposes of the statute, by the restriction

which we put upon them that they should hear the party before they inflict

upon him such a heavy loss. [189]

A party cannot predict beforehand as to what will be the need or the advantage

of that party being represented in court.

As it was said above, the authorities relied upon by the 04th respondent do not

show that a party who has been in the capacity of managerial agent cannot

appear in the court which ordered liquidation or before the Liquidator.

It has been argued that restitutio in integrum is only available to a party.

Whether NSB is a party, because there could be degrees in involvement as a

party, is a question for mature considerations.

The petitioner is attempting to invoke not only restitutio but also revision.

A large number of authorities have been cited to say as to why revision is not

available, from the requirement to have exceptional circumstances onwards.

Paragraph 64 of the written submissions rely heavily upon Siripala vs. Lanerolle

and another, 2012 (1) SLR Part 04. This will be referred to later.

Interestingly, the 04th respondent refer to CA/RII/0006/2022, Aussie Oats

Milling (Private) Limited vs. Future Consumer Limited to say,

Although revisionary jurisdiction shares characteristics with the

appellate jurisdiction, they are not one and the same (at page 26)

[Emphasis in the written submissions of the 04th respondent]

8 | R I I 2 1 2 0 2 2 J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e M a y a d u n n e C o r e a O r d e r o n P r e l i m i n a r y o b j e c t i o n s o f t h e 0 4 t h r e s p o n d e n t

This is an order written by me on 31.03.2022. In that case I have relied upon SC

Appeal No. 111/2015 with 113/2015 and 114/2015 decided by Justice

Aluvihare to substantiate the availability of revision.

My reasoning on that case was based on Article 138(1) of the Constitution, which

reads,

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions of

the Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the correction

of all errors in fact or in law which shall be [committed by the High Court,

in the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by any Court of First

Instance]9 , tribunal or other institution and sole and exclusive

cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, of all

causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things [of which such

High Court, Court of First Instance]10 tribunal or other institution may

have taken cognizance.

Although the reasoning in Aussie Oates case mainly addressed the phrase or

of any law in the above article, as the quotations extensively used from the above

Supreme Court case decided by Justice Aluvihare tends to answer many a

question on the availability of revision, they are again quoted as follows,

The words or of any law is sometimes sought to be interpreted to mean

that when there is any law which provides for an appeal to a different

forum, the Court of Appeal cannot exercise any power under Article 138(1).

But this was explained in SC Appeal No. 111/2015 with 113/2015 and

114/2015 by Justice Aluwihare in the Supreme Court. Paragraph 29 of

that judgment says,

Particularly in relation to the revisionary jurisdiction, which exists to

remedy miscarriage of justice, greater care must be exercised when

9 | R I I 2 1 2 0 2 2 J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e M a y a d u n n e C o r e a O r d e r o n P r e l i m i n a r y o b j e c t i o n s o f t h e 0 4 t h r e s p o n d e n t

employing the maxim1. As I observed earlier, the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is a Constitutional mandate which,

undoubtedly is subject to the provision of statutory law. Nevertheless,

owing to its genesis in the Constitution, any restriction or modification

which the Legislature seeks to introduce must be introduced by way

of express wording. The omission to refer to revisionary jurisdiction

in Section 9 of Act No. 19 of 1990 cannot be taken as reducing the

Court of Appeals plenitude of powers under Article 138. Nothing less

than an express removal of these powers would be required to achieve

such a result.

The question raised in that case was similar to the argument taken by the

respondent in the present case. That is to say that when the Supreme

Court has been given appellate powers the Court of Appeal has no

jurisdiction on revision. The only difference is that in the present case not

only revision, but also the power of restitutio in integrum is in question.

His Lordship said at paragraph 08,

.It was the contention on behalf of the Respondents, that Section 9

of the said Act has vested that power in the Supreme Court, thereby

completely ousting the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal in respect of

such matters. They contend that the specific use of the term appeal

in Section 9 of the Act, indicates that the legislature only intended to

vest appellate jurisdiction with the Supreme Court in respect of such

matters where the High Court has exercised its appellate powers, and

not revisionary jurisdiction.

It was further said at paragraph 09,

They seek to fortify this contention by referring to Article 138 of the

Constitution which uses the term subject to any law. Accordingly,

1 expressio unius est exclusio alterius.

10 | R I I 2 1 2 0 2 2 J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e M a y a d u n n e C o r e a O r d e r o n P r e l i m i n a r y o b j e c t i o n s o f t h e 0 4 t h r e s p o n d e n t

their contention is that under Section 9, there is only one recourse,

which is the right of appeal to the Supreme Court; if a litigant fails to

utilize the provision, they cannot seek to circumvent the procedure by

resorting to a revisionary step.

The Supreme Court did not accept that the revisionary powers are

ancillary to appellate powers or is a subset of the appellate powers. It said

at paragraph 10,

The above argument is firstly premised on the assumption that the

revisionary jurisdiction and the appellate jurisdiction are one and the

same. It is only if the former is a subset of the latter, could the taking

away of the appellate power results in automatically suspending the

revisionary powers. However, historically, it has been the opinion of

our Courts that the revisionary jurisdiction is distinct from appellate

jurisdiction. One basic distinction would be that while the appellate

rights are statutory, the exercise of revisionary power is discretionary.

Although revisionary jurisdiction shares characteristics with the

appellate jurisdiction, they are not one and the same.

It was further said at paragraph 12,

Furthermore, time to time, Courts in Sri Lanka have observed that an

appellant could invoke the revisionary jurisdiction even when there is

a right of appeal available (vide Attorney General v. Podisingho (1950)

51 NLR 385) and when there is no right of appeal available (vide Sunil

Chandra Kumar v. Veloo (2001) 3 SLR 91) or when the said right of

appeal has been exercised (vide K. A. Potman v. Inspector of Police,

Dodangoda (1971)74 NLR 115). This in itself is sufficient evidence to

sustain the claim that appellate jurisdiction and revisionary

jurisdiction are two distinct jurisdictions.

11 | R I I 2 1 2 0 2 2 J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e M a y a d u n n e C o r e a O r d e r o n P r e l i m i n a r y o b j e c t i o n s o f t h e 0 4 t h r e s p o n d e n t

Not only that the revisionary jurisdiction is not a subset of the appellate

jurisdiction, but also when the appellate jurisdiction vests in another

forum, revisionary jurisdiction could vest in the Court of Appeal. The

judgment said at paragraph 21,

At the outset, it must be borne in mind that the Revisionary

Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is a Constitutional mandate. Its

genesis lies in Article 138 of the Constitution. There is no question that

the Constitution is the supreme law of the land (vide In re reference

under Article 125(1) for the Constitution (2008) BLR 160 SC). In those

circumstances, any ouster or restriction of a Courts jurisdiction which

is founded on the Constitution, in so far as it is permitted under the

Constitution, must be made in express language. In Re the Nineteenth

Amendment to the Constitution (2002) 3 SLR 85, a bench of 7 judges

unequivocally opined that This manifests a cardinal rule that applies

to the interpretation of a Constitution, that there can be no implied

amendment of any provision of the Constitution (at page 110).

Therefore, it is only right and befitting that this Court insists that every

provision which restricts or modifies a Courts Constitutional mandate

are express and are set out in no uncertain terms.

This Court further added, in Aussie Oates case, also quoting from the same case

of the Supreme Court,

The Supreme Court further expressed the views reproduced below

at paragraph 32, The Court of Appeal has on a previous occasion

specifically dismissed an attempt to restrict the revisionary

jurisdiction to a corresponding statutory right. It was observed The

Petitioner in a Revision application only seeks the indulgence of Court

to remedy a miscarriage of justice. He does not assert it as a right.

Revision is available unless it is restricted by the Constitution or any

12 | R I I 2 1 2 0 2 2 J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e M a y a d u n n e C o r e a O r d e r o n P r e l i m i n a r y o b j e c t i o n s o f t h e 0 4 t h r e s p o n d e n t

other law (vide Veloo (supra) at page 103). Although the Supreme

Court is not bound by the said decision, I see no reason to disagree

with the principle enunciated there. In my opinion, if the revisionary

jurisdiction was also to be subject to a statutory right there would not

be any difference between the two jurisdictions.

This court, in Aussie Oates case, was mindful of a cautionary remark added by

the Supreme Court too. It was said,

The Supreme Court adding a cautionary remark said at paragraph

34, I must not be miscomprehended as advocating an unfettered

conferment of revisionary jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal. For

reasons adumbrated above, such a construction extending unfettered

revisionary jurisdiction cannot stand, in view of the clear reference to

subject to the provisions of any law in Article 138 of the Constitution.

However, the only way in which the restriction or an ouster could be

introduced in this regard, is by way of an express removal of the

same and not by resorting to purported or implied omissions. In fact,

the Legislature where it intended to oust the revisionary jurisdiction

has expressed the same in unequivocal terms.

In SIRIPALA V. LANEROLLE AND ANOTHER, 2012 too, relied upon for the 04th

respondent, it was said,

Failure to avail himself of the alternative remedy of appeal would not

necessarily be a bar to invoking the revisionary powers provided there are

exceptional circumstances.

The present section 753 of the Civil Procedure Code, which was inserted by

Amendment Act No. 79 of 1988, section 49, is as follows,

The Court of Appeal may, of its own motion or on any application made,

call for an examine the record of any case, whether already tried or pending

13 | R I I 2 1 2 0 2 2 J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e M a y a d u n n e C o r e a O r d e r o n P r e l i m i n a r y o b j e c t i o n s o f t h e 0 4 t h r e s p o n d e n t

trial, in any Court, tribunal or other institution for the purpose of

satisfying itself as to the legality or propriety of any judgment or order

passed therein, or as to the regularity of the proceedings of such Court,

tribunal or other institution and may upon revision of the case brought

before it pass any judgment or make any order thereon, as the

interests of justice may require.

In Fernando vs. Ceylon Breweries Ltd., 1998, 03, SLR 61, Justice U. De Z.

Gunewardane in the Court of Appeal compared the old section 753 of the Civil

Procedure Code with the present one introduced by Act No. 79 of 1988 and

said,

'The essence of the difference between the two forms of section 753 ie

in its original and amended form is this: as the said section stood originally,

the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court in the exercise of its revisionary

powers could have only made the same order which it might have made had

the case been brought before it by way of an appeal whereas in the

amended form the section empowers the Court of Appeal, in the exercise

of its powers of revision, to make any order as the interests of justice

may require'. Pages 64,65

His Lordship concluded,

'Thus it would be noticed that the amended section enables the court to

be more flexible and less legalistic in its means and in approach in dealing

with a matter for section 753 in its amended form seems to exalt not so

much the rigour of the law but unalloyed justice, in the sense of good-sense

and fairness. So that the basis of the rationale for insistence on the

requirement of special circumstances as a condition - precedent to the

exercise of revisionary powers had disappeared as a consequence of the

amendment of section 753 of the Civil Procedure Code by virtue of

14 | R I I 2 1 2 0 2 2 J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e M a y a d u n n e C o r e a O r d e r o n P r e l i m i n a r y o b j e c t i o n s o f t h e 0 4 t h r e s p o n d e n t

which amendment the Court of Appeal is now freed from the duty or

rather the necessity of making the same order as it would have made

in appeal and is empowered to make any order as the interests of

justice may require'. Page 65

Though the decision in The Ceylon Brewery Limited vs. Jax Fernando, Proprietor,

Maradana Wine Stores, 2001 decided in the Supreme Court by Mark Fernando

J., overruled the above decision of U. de Z. Gunewardane J., it was done only in

respect of the decision in the latter that an application made under section 86(2)

of Civil Procedure Code can be allowed even if that was made one day after the

stipulated time of 14 days. The Supreme Court said, I therefore set aside the

judgment of the Court of Appeal on that point. The decision pertaining to

wider powers given by amended section 753, the ability of the court to

make a justifiable order in revision and hence revision not being only an

additional remedy granted on mere discretion was hence not set aside.

Having considered the dictum of Abrahams, CJ in Ameen v. Rasheed, that ' I can

see no reason why the petitioner should expect us to exercise our revisional

powers in his favour when he might have appealed and I would allow the

preliminary objection and dismiss the application with costs ', His Lordship

Gunewardane J., further observed,

'But the validity of the above reason for denying the relief in revision can

no longer be accepted with favour inasmuch as the Court of Appeal in

consequence of the amendment of section 753 by Act No. 79 of 1988 is now

clothed with greater amplitude of power in making orders and is not

confined, as formerly, ie before the aforesaid amendment, to making the

same order which it might have made had the matter been brought before

it by way of appeal. Since, prior to the amendment of section 753 the court

could whilst acting in revision only make the same order as it could have

15 | R I I 2 1 2 0 2 2 J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e M a y a d u n n e C o r e a O r d e r o n P r e l i m i n a r y o b j e c t i o n s o f t h e 0 4 t h r e s p o n d e n t

made in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction - the right of appeal and

right in revision were justifiably treated as more or less, alternative remedies

- available, more or less, in such a way that when one was accepted or made

available the other had to be rejected or refused. When, as was the case

prior to the amendment of section 753 of the Civil Procedure Code, the

reliefs available or the orders that could be made by the court, by way of

appeal and revision, were conterminous or the same - it could legitimately

and even logically be inquired or queried, as had been done by His Lordship,

Abrahams, CJ, in the excerpt of the judgment cited above, as to why the

revisionary process, which may be described as a privileged procedure, was

invoked in preference to that of appeal, several advantages or benefits being

attendant on the revisionary process which would not be available to one

who seeks relief by way of an appeal (for instance one need not furnish

security or keep to certain prescribed time-limits as in the case when one

appeals against an order) - the recourse to revision was treated as an

extraordinary procedure in contradistinction to the procedure of appeal

which was considered to be the normal remedy, when the order in question

was appealable - as is the order in this case before me'. Page 66

There might be an argument that section 753 is in the Civil Procedure Code,

whereas, the matter at hand is under the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007.

But, section 753 deals with the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal,

which is this Court and section 753, which was reproduced above, was

considered by U. de Z. Gunewardane J., in relation to the powers of this court

and not in relation to a matter under the Civil Procedure Code.

In any event, whether exceptional circumstances are a must and if so are they

present is a matter for mature consideration.

The 04th respondent has submitted that the 04th respondent is not an interloper.

That is exactly why he has been added a party respondent.

It is submitted in paragraph 90 of the written submissions of the 04th

respondent, that,

if NSB is allowed to continue as a party in the said legal proceedings, it

would constitute a major interference with the activities of the liquidator

of Entrust Securities PLC and such would seriously jeopardize and

endanger E. R. Gnanams chances of recovering her funds.

However, as per the written submissions of the petitioner the petitioner was

appointed as the Central Bank noticed that there had been some dubious

transactions and there are question marks whether actually the money came in

by some purported creditors, which are matters to be investigated.

Neither the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, nor the other purported

creditors, or HNB Finance PLC, the petitioner in the winding up case have

objected to the NSB being heard.

The petitioner has further submitted that there is no clear demarcation as to

who is not a party to winding up proceedings. As said already the 04th

respondents purported authorities too do not show that a person who has been

in the capacity of a managerial agent is prevented from being heard.

It is also submitted that NSB is an interested and vital party which has much

information to share both with the court and the Liquidator and it must not be

shut out.

The petitioner also cites, at paragraph 22 of the written submissions, the case of

Budhdadasa Kaluarachchi vs. Nilamani Wijewickrema and another [1990] 1 SLR

262, at 268, that,

The trend of recent decisions is that the Court of Appeal has the power

to act in revision eventhough the procedure by way of appeal is available

in appropriate cases.

In the circumstances, this Court overrules the preliminary and other objections

raised for the 04th respondent by way of the above motion dated 20.01.2023 and

this court extends the interim order granted in this case to be in force until the

final determination of the case.

The 04th respondent is at liberty to file comprehensive objections.

Finally as said in Re Union Accident Insurance Co. Ltd., (1972) 1 All E R 1105

by Plowman J.,

Any views I express about the matter now are of course provisional

only because I am not trying the petition at the present time,

is applicable to what is said above in regard to the right of the petitioner to be

heard in the High Court and in Liquidation proceedings, as that matter was not

fully decided.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

Hon. Mayadunne Corea, J.

I agree.
