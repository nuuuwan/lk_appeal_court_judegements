JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted in the High Court of Jaffna under Section 296 of the

Penal Code for committing the murder of Sivaseelan Jesutha on or about the

09th of February 2006.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Jaffna as the Appellant

had opted for a non-jury trial. After the conclusion of the prosecution case,

the learned High Court Judge had called for the defence and the Appellant

had made a dock statement and closed his case. After considering the

evidence presented by both parties, the learned High Court Judge had

convicted the Appellant under section 296 of Penal code and sentenced him

to death on 25/02/2016.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent for this matter to be argued in his absence due to the

Covid 19 pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellant was

connected via Zoom from prison.

Background of the Case

According to the evidence led at the trial, the Appellant and the deceased

were husband and wife and they were blessed with a 09-year-old daughter

at the time of the demise of the deceased. Their married life was not stable

as constant fights erupted caused by the inebriated Appellant. The Appellant

3 | P a g e

used to beat the deceased when he was under the influence of liquor. Nobody

had visited the deceased including her mother out of fear for the Appellant.

On the night in question, the witnesses had heard the Appellant beating the

deceased despite her pleas not to harm her. The deceaseds naked body was

found wrapped in a mat inside her house on the following day.

According to the Judicial Medical Officer the deceased had sustained several

cut injuries on her neck region and shock and hemorrhage due to Primary

Brain Damage and Transection of Spinal Cord due to multiple cut injuries

were declared as the cause of death.

Following appeal grounds were advanced by the Appellant.

1. The Learned High Court Judge has flawed in law by imposing a

burden on the Accused-Appellant to support his plea of alibi.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has factually misdirected himself

when evaluation the dock statement, thereby causing serious

prejudice to the Accused-Appellant.

3. The Learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself on the

burden of proof on an accused by imposing a burden on the

Accused-Appellant to rebut the prosecution version.

4. When the prosecution has not established a link between the

weapon recovered from the scene and the accused, the Learned

High Court Judge has arrived at a conclusive finding that the

Accused-Appellant had murdered the deceased using the said

weapon.

5. The prosecution has totally failed to establish the time of death,

which is vital in the backdrop of the defense of alibi embarked

upon by the Accused-Appellant.

6. The Learned High Court Judge has erroneously applied Section

106 of the Evidence Ordinance.

7. Accused-Appellant has been denied a fair trial as the prosecution

has failed to conduct the investigations with due diligence by

4 | P a g e

sending the blood-stained sarong and shirt to the Government

Analyst.

8. Items of Circumstantial evidence are wholly inadequate to support

the conviction.

9. Application of the Ellenborough principle is wholly unwarranted.

As the appeal grounds first, third and fifth are interconnected, the said

grounds will be considered together.

In the first appeal ground the Counsel for the Appellant contended that the

Learned High Court Judge has erred in law by imposing a burden on the

Accused-Appellant to support his plea of alibi.

In order to tender plea of alibi certain pre-conditions has been laid down in

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

Section 126A of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act states as follows:

(1) No person shall be entitled during a trial on indictment in

the High Court, to adduce evidence in support of the defence

of an alibi, unless he has-

(a) stated such fact to the police at the time of his

making his statement during the investigation; or

(b) stated such fact at any time during the

preliminary inquiry; or

(c) raised such defence, after indictment has been

served, with notice to the Attorney-General at

any time prior to fourteen days of the date of

commencement of the trial:

Provided however, the Court may, if it is of the opinion that the

accused has adduced reasons which are sufficient to show why

he delayed to raise the defence of alibi within the period set out

above, permit the accused at any time thereafter but prior to the

5 | P a g e

conclusion of the case for the prosecution, to raise the defence

of alibi.

According to the above-mentioned section, the defense has to fulfil one of the

three conditions laid down in the that section. But the proviso to Section

126A permits the Court to exercise a discretion in allowing an alibi

notwithstanding the fact that the accused has delayed raising an alibi as set

out in the section.

In this case the Appellant took up the plea of alibi in his dock statement.

According to him he had brought the deceased home and went for work at

Kokkuwil on the night of the date of the incident.

When an accused person raises plea of alibi there is no burden on him to

prove it. The burden is always on the prosecution to rebut such a defense

beyond reasonable doubt.

In Jayatissa v. The Attorney General [2010] 1 SLR 279 the court held

that:

. the trial judge has gone on the wrong assumption that

burden of proof of alibi is on the defense.

Hence, in this case the Learned High Court Judge has erred in law by

imposing a burden on the Accused-Appellant to support his plea of alibi.

In Hakkini Asela De Silva v. AG SC Appeal No.14/2011, decided on

16.01.2014 the court held that even if the learned Trial Judge had

misdirected himself with respect to the plea of alibi, the conviction should

stand if it can be reasonably concluded that the accused persons were guilty

of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.

Hence, in this case proper evaluation of evidence should be carried out to

see whether the Appellant could succeed in his plea of alibi even though he

had only taken it up in his dock statement.

6 | P a g e

According to PW1, Kannan, the deceased had come to his house to watch a

teledrama on that fateful day. Around 7.45 p.m. the Appellant accompanied

the deceased to his house which is situated about 300 meters from his

house. On the following day, which was a Friday, he had visited the temple

and only upon his return home around 3.00 p.m. had he come to know about

the death of the deceased.

PW3, Lalithambal was the immediate neighbor of the deceased. On the night

of incident some relatives had visited her house. From about 8.30 p.m. she

could hear the Appellant beating the deceased and the deceased shouting

pleadingly not to harm her. The deceased also pleaded the Appellant not to

shout as visitors had come to her neighbors house. Despite of the pleading

of the deceased the Appellant had continued beating her until around 10.30

p.m. At one point the witness had heard the deceased shouting that the

Appellant was going to kill her. She did not take any action as the Appellant

used to abuse in filth if anybody interferes with their affairs.

As the wailing of the deceased subsided after about 11.00 p.m., this witness

had looked for the deceased around 3.00 a.m. but the search was futile as

the gate of the deceaseds house was closed. As her relations were inside her

house, she did not proceed any further until 1.00 p.m. on the following day.

As the deceased was not to be seen, this witness along with another neighbor

called Kili had gone to the deceaseds house and found the deceaseds naked

body wrapped in a mat.

PW2, Puwaneswaris evidence also corroborated PW3s narration of events.

PW4, Saroja is the mother of the deceased. According to her, the deceased

had a 9-year-old daughter at the time of her demise. She was aware that the

Appellant used to beat her daughter. As the deceased did not come for the

birthday party which this witness attended, the witness had gone to the

deceaseds house and inquired as to why she was unable to attend. The

deceased had told her that the Appellant had not allow her to go. Further

she requested her to take her daughter away as the Appellant is expected

7 | P a g e

home intoxicated. Hence, she accompanied the deceaseds daughter who was

9 years old at that time.

PW7, IP/Wijeratna was the chief investigator of this case. When he received

the first complaint about the murder from PW1, he had visited the scene

along with a team of police officers. In the course of the investigation, a group

of people brought the Appellant to the scene of crime. After initial inquiry, he

was arrested as a suspect for the death of the deceased. At the time of arrest

the Appellant carried a bag along with him. A blood-stained shirt and a

sarong were inside the bag. The said items along with other items were taken

into PW7s custody for further investigation.

When the defense was called, the Appellant made a dock statement.

According to him, on the date of the incident, after accompanying the

deceased home, he had gone to Kokkuvil for mason work after dinner. On

the following morning after work, he had gone to a bar to consume liquor at

5.00 a.m. Around 2.00 p.m. while consuming liquor he was caught and

severely beaten by the relations of the deceased. Hence, his position was that

he was elsewhere after dinner on the previous night.

In this case the Appellant did not follow procedures laid down under Section

126A of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 when he pleaded

an alibi in his dock statement. Further he had not raised a single question

regarding his alibi defense to lay witnesses who gave evidence about beating

the deceased from 8.30-10.30 p.m. on that fateful day. Hence, the only

conclusion that this court can reach is that the stance taken by the Appellant

in his dock statement is a clear after-thought. Further consuming liquor

from 5.00 a.m. in a bar, is a blatant lie uttered by the Appellant.

In Gunasiri and Two Others v. Republic of Sri Lanka [2009] 1 SLR 31 the

court held that:

(4) Although the 3rd accused appellant raised an alibi in his dock

statement, he failed to suggest his position to the prosecution

witnesses. It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the

8 | P a g e

opponent has declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put

his case in cross examination, it must follow that the evidence

tendered on that issue ought to be accepted. The failure to suggest

the defence of alibi to the prosecution witnesses who implicated

the accused, indicates that it-was a false one.

Similarly, in this case too, the Appellants failure to suggest his plea of alibi

to prosecution witnesses clearly indicate that he had falsely advanced the

plea of alibi which only suggest that it only amounts to an afterthought.

In Hakkini Asela De Silva v. AG (Supra) the court further held that:

Even if there is a misdirection on the alibi, still a conviction can

be entered if the Court forms a view that a reasonable jury

properly directed would come to the same conclusion.

Hence his first ground has no merit at all.

The Appellant in his third and fifth grounds of appeal contends that the

Learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself on the burden of proof

on an accused by imposing a burden on the Accused-Appellant to rebut the

prosecution version and the prosecution has totally failed to establish the

time of death, which is vital in the backdrop of the alibi embarked upon by

the Accused-Appellant.

These grounds of appeal also fail as these are interconnected with ground

number one for which it was already held that no merit was established by

the Appellant.

Next, I consider it appropriate to consider the fourth and seventh grounds of

appeal together as its related to the productions marked by the prosecution.

The Appellant in his fourth ground of appeal argues that when the

prosecution has not established a link between the weapon recovered from

the scene and the accused, the Learned High Court Judge has arrived at a

conclusive finding that the Accused-Appellant had murdered the deceased

using the said weapon.

9 | P a g e

The investigating officer had recovered an axe from the scene of crime.

According to his evidence the axe which had been marked as P2 was

recovered from very close proximity to the dead body. The blade of the axe is

about 7 inches in length and 3 inches in width. The handle is 3 feet and 05

inches in height. Blood patches were found on the axe blade and the handle.

According to PW04, the mother of the deceased, the Appellant had borrowed

her axe two weeks prior to the incident. At the trial she had identified the

axe which had been recovered from the crime scene with patches of blood.

During the cross-examination not a single question was put to this witness

regarding the axe by the defense.

As the JMO who submitted the Postmortem Report had gone abroad pending

trial before the High Court, PW9, Dr. Ratnasingham has given evidence on

behalf of the doctor who had performed the autopsy. The postmortem had

revealed serious injuries caused to the neck region of the deceased.

According to the report multiple deep cut injuries were seen in the posterior

neck region with fracture of vertebral column between 2nd and 3rd vertebra.

Multiple cut injuries were seen on Posterior Occipital scalp. Brain substance

was expelled out. Multiple fractures were noted below the cut injuries.

Damaged subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage were seen on both sides

of the brain. Contusions were seen on the left posterior shoulder.

According to the doctor the death had been caused due to shock and

hemorrhage due to primary brain damage and transection of spinal cord due

to multiple cut injuries.

The Learned State Counsel who led the evidence of the doctor had failed to

show the axe to the doctor to get his opinion. Although this is a serious lapse

on the part of the Prosecution, the defense had questioned about the injuries

sustained by the deceased during cross-examination. The doctor had

answered that all the injuries noted on the neck region are cut injuries.

In the seventh ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the Accused-

Appellant has been denied a fair trial as the prosecution has failed to conduct

10 | P a g e

the investigations with due diligence by sending the blood-stained sarong

and shirt to the Government Analyst.

PW7, the investigating officer of this case explained as to why he had taken

the productions into his custody in this case. This has been because he

reasonably suspected that the productions, namely the axe, the shirt and

the sarong would have a direct connection to the crime committed.

In Mannar Mannan v. The Republic of Sri Lanka [1987] 2 SLR 94 the

court held that:

No prejudice was caused by the failure to send the accused's

shirt for examination to the Government Analyst in view of the

Police Sergeant's evidence regarding blood stains on accused's

shirt because the Judge gave the direction that one did not know

what the stains were thus stressing the uncertainty, of the stains

to the jury.

Even though the said production were not sent to the Government Analyst

or the prosecution had failed to adduced such evidence will not affect the

right to a fair trial as the Learned High Court Judge had correctly considered

all other evidence available to come to his decision. Hence, the appeal

grounds raised above have no merit.

In the second ground of appeal the Appellant contended that the Learned

High Court Judge has factually misdirected himself when evaluating the

dock statement, thereby causing serious prejudice to the Accused-Appellant.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the legal position in

accepting the dock statement of an accused in our criminal jurisdiction,

accurately considered and analyzed the dock statement of the Appellant

before he could reject the same. He had given plausible reasons as to why he

decided not to act on the dock statement of the Appellant. Hence, it is

incorrect to say that the Learned High Court Judge had factually misdirected

11 | P a g e

himself when he evaluated and considered the dock statement of the

Appellant. Therefore, this ground also has no merit.

In the sixth ground of appeal the Learned Counsel contends that the Learned

High Court Judge has erroneously applied Section 106 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

Section 106 of the Evidence Ordinance states:

When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the

burden of proving that fact is upon him.

Although the Learned High Court Judge had considered Section 106 of the

Evidence Ordinance in his judgment, he has not shifted the burden of proof

on to the Appellant. He has merely stated that the Appellant should have

explained as to what happened following the fight at his residence. The

defense taken up by the Appellant in his dock statement was not put to the

prosecution witnesses in the cross examination.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in The Law of Evidence Vol II (Book-1)

Limitations of Section-106 at page 264 states:

(c) The Section must be read in the light of the overall burden on the

prosecution. It cannot override the presumption of innocence or be

used to cast the burden on the accused.

In Sanitary Inspector, Mirigama v. Thangamani Nadar 55 NLR 302 the

court held that:

The presumption of innocence casts on the prosecution the

burden of proving every ingredient of an offence even though

negative averments be involved therein.

As the Learned High Court Judge had not shifted the burden of proof on the

Appellant in this case, mentioning Section 106 of the Evidence Ordinance in

12 | P a g e

the judgement has not caused any prejudice to the Appellant. Hence, this

ground also lacks merit.

Under the eighth ground of appeal the Learned Counsel for the Appellant

contends that the items of circumstantial evidence are wholly inadequate to

support the conviction.

In this case in order to find the Appellant guilty of the charge, all the

circumstances must point at the Appellant to show that he is the one who

committed the murder of the deceased and not anybody else. It is the

incumbent duty of the prosecution to prove the same beyond reasonable

doubt.

The Appellant in this case admitted that he brought the deceased home from

the house of PW1 in the night on the date of the incident. PW2 and PW3 gave

evidence to the effect that the Appellant had assaulted the deceased on that

night till 10.30 p.m. PW3 had heard the deceased desperately pleading with

the Appellant not to harm her. She had also requested the Appellant not to

shout as some visitors were present next door. The Appellant not only

assaulted the deceased but he had scolded her too. Witness PW3 had last

heard the desperate wailing of the deceased around 10.30 p.m. Thereafter,

nothing was heard from the deceased or the Appellant. The deceaseds naked

body was found in her house on the following afternoon.

The Appellant had brought an axe from PW4, the mother of the deceased two

weeks prior to the incident. The investigating officer had recovered the said

axe from close proximity to the deceaseds body with blood stains. PW4 had

identified the said axe during the trial.

According to the doctor extensive cut injuries were seen on the neck region

of the deceased. Her spinal cord also had been severed.

The Appellant was arrested by the investigation officer when he was handed

over to him by the villagers. A blood-stained shirt and a sarong were found

inside a bag carried by the Appellant.

The Appellant although has raised an alibi in his dock statement, he had not

posted any question in the cross-examination for any of the prosecution

13 | P a g e

witnesses. The position taken up by the Appellant that he was consuming

liquor in a bar from 5 a.m. after work on the following day, proved to be a

blatant lie.

In the case of C.Chenga Reddy and others v. State of A.P.(1996) 10 SCC

193 the court held that:

In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the settled law is that the

circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is drawn should be

fully proved and such circumstances must be conclusive in nature.

Moreover, all the circumstances should be complete and there should be

no gap left in the chain of evidence. Further the proved circumstances

must be consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt of the accused and

totally inconsistent with his innocence.

In the case of Attorney General v. Potta Naufer & others [2007) 2 SLR 144

the court held that:

When relying on circumstantial evidence to establish the charge of

conspiracy to commit murder and the charge of murder, the proved items

of circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point

towards the only inference that the accused committed the offence.

As discussed under appeal ground number eight, the prosecution had

adduced strong and incriminating circumstantial evidence against the

Appellant. The Learned High Court Judge had accurately analyzed all the

evidence presented by both parties and concluded that all the circumstances

are consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the Appellant and

totally inconsistent with his innocence.

In the final ground of appeal, the Learned Counsel contends that the

Application of the Ellenborough principle is wholly unwarranted.

The Learned High Court Judge, though in the judgment cited judgments in

which the Ellenborough Principle had been considered, had not relied on

14 | P a g e

that principle. He only considered the dock statement of the Appellant in

detail and came to the conclusion to reject the same. Therefore, it is incorrect

to argue that the Learned High Court Judge had applied the Ellenborough

Principle in this case.

Considering the evidence presented by both parties in this case, I conclude

that the prosecution has presented highly incriminating circumstantial

evidence against the Appellant. But he has failed to offer a reasonable

explanation against the incriminating circumstances which had only pointed

at the Appellant as the perpetrator of this case.

As the Learned High Court Judge had rightly convicted the Appellant for the

charge of murder, I affirm the conviction and dismiss the Appeal of the

Appellant.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Jaffna along with the original case record.
