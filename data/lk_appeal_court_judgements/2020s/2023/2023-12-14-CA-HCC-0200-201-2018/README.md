3 | P a g e

After calling 05 witnesses the prosecution had closed their case. The learned

High Court Judge had called for the defence and the Appellants had made

dock statements and called three witnesses on their behalf. After considering

the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High Court Judge had

convicted the Appellants as charged and sentenced them as follows:

For the 1st count each Appellant was imposed 10 years rigorous

imprisonment. Further, the Appellants were imposed a fine of

Rs.105,000,00/- each with a default sentence of 04-years rigorous

imprisonment.

For the second count, the first Appellant was imposed 02 years rigorous

imprisonment with a fine of Rs.7500/-. In default 06 months rigorous

imprisonment was imposed.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Appellants are on bail at present.

Background of the Case.

According to the prosecution, the vehicle bearing No. WP HH 7294 is belongs

to the Ministry of Agriculture. When the Appellants were arrested, the 1st

Appellant was driving the vehicle while the 2nd Appellant was seated next to

the driving seat. At the time of the arrest, the Appellants were using the

vehicle without proper authority from the Ministry. Furthermore, the said

date of the incident was an election day and the police had identified the area

in which the arrest happened as an area with high rate of election violence.

When searching the vehicle, posters printed for election propaganda were

found and the 1st Appellant was in the possession of a revolver without a

valid license.

The 1st Appellant in his dock statement stated that he was arrested on the

said grounds due to his political involvements, and that he was using a

4 | P a g e

vehicle which was given to him by the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock

to whom he was supporting. Further, he stated that the revolver in his

possession was issued to him in accordance with the law and that he

received the bullets from the Kosgama Army Headquarters.

The 2nd Appellant in his dock statement stated that, on the said date he was

given the key of a vehicle and was given orders to go with the 1st Appellant.

He further said that he was unaware as to the ownership of the vehicle.

At the hearing of this appeal the Learned Presidents Counsel for the

Appellants had raised following grounds of appeal.

1. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider that the person

to whom the vehicle had been handed over was not called to as a

witness and thereby the prosecution has failed to unfold the narrative

leading to an adverse presumption under Section 114(f) of the

Evidence Ordinance.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has not considered the fact that the

prosecution has failed to establish the ingredients of Criminal

Misappropriation of the vehicle beyond reasonable doubt.

3. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider the fact that the

firearm had been issued to 1st Appellant under the approval of the

Ministry of Defence.

4. The Appellants have been deprived of a fair trial.

5. That in any event the punishment imposed is excessive and

unreasonable in the light of the evidence presented.

As all the grounds of appeal are interconnected, all ground will be considered

together in this appeal.

According to PW4 Premadasa Weerakanda, he was the Secretary to the

Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock at the time relevant to this case. The

5 | P a g e

Minister in charge of the Ministry was Hon.S.B Dissananyake. The witness

had faced some difficulty to assume his duty on 22.03.2004. The vehicle in

question WP HH 7294 was belonged to his Ministry and was allocated to

Ministers Private Secretary Thamara Dissananyake with an official driver for

her official use. The witness had categorically said that all responsibility

regarding the vehicle rested on the person to whom the subject matter was

released. The witness further said that, there was no complaint received from

the Private Secretary to the Minister, until the police investigation regarding

this vehicle was commenced.

According to PW2, Somawathie Jayatunga, who was a director to the

Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, nobody can be use vehicle without the

authorization of the Private Secretary.

In this case the investigator of the Special Investigation Unit of the Police

Headquarters had not taken any endeavor to record statement from the

Private Secretary to the Minister and had not named her as a witness to this

case. She is an essential witness which had escaped the attention of the

prosecution as well.

According to the dock statement of the 1st Appellant, the vehicle in question

was given to him by the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock for Ministers

election work. The prosecution had not cleared this doubt throughout the

case.

In order to ensure a fair trial, the prosecution has a duty to call all necessary

witnesses in a trial. Although the prosecution has a discretion to call and

examine a witness or omit to call a witness, this direction must be used fairly

in the interest of justice.

6 | P a g e

In Mohmood v Western Australia [2008] 232 CLR 397 the Court held that:

where a witness, who might have been expected to be called and to

give evidence on a matter, is not called by the prosecution, the question

is not whether the jury may properly each conclusion about issues of

fact but whether, in the circumstances, they should be entertain a

reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused.

In Walimunige John and Another v The State 76 NLR 488, the Court held

that:

The question of a presumption arises only where a witness whose

evidence is necessary to unfold the narrative is withheld by the

prosecution and the failure to call such a witness constitute a vital

missing link in the prosecution case.

Considering the nature of this case and the circumstances under which the

vehicle was used by the Appellants should have been elicited through proper

witnesses in the trial. As long as there is no complaint from either the

Minister or the Private Secretary to the Minister, the Private Secretary and

the Minister should have been called by the prosecution in order to clear

doubts raised by the Appellants in their dock statements.

Although, the prosecution argued that the evidence of the Private Secretary

is not necessary or not relevant to prove the prosecution case, I conclude

that she is an essential witness to this case. Not recording her evidence

create a serious doubt in the prosecution case.

Next, the Learned DSG in her written submission contended that the best

evidence of the defense case would have been the Minister who authorized

such taking of the vehicle. However, the defense at the High Court trial had

7 | P a g e

failed to call the Minister as a witness and thus the case of the defense, that

the Minister gave such vehicle is without any merit.

In a criminal trial the onus of proving the charge is on the prosecution

beyond reasonable doubt which never shifts.

In Dyers v The Queen [2002] 210 CLR 285, the Court held that:

No comment should be made as to the failure of the defense to call a

witness who might have been able to assist the defense.If any

comment is to be given it is that the jury should not speculate about

what a witness not called might have said.

Next, the Learned Presidents Counsel strenuously argued that the Learned

High Court judge had failed to consider the fact that the firearm in question

had been issued to the 1st Appellant by the Ministry of Defence.

The 1st Appellant in his dock statement stated that he was in active politics

for about 21 years. He was elected as the Chairman of Walapane Pradeshya

Saba in the years 2000 and he functioned as the Opposition Leader of the

Saba thereafter. For his security, a 0.38 revolver and ammunitions were

issued to him by the Ministry of Defence in the year 2000. The defense had

marked V7 a letter issued by the Sri Lanka Army to confirmed the same.

At this point, due to highly technical in nature, the Learned Deputy Solicitor

General, in keeping with the highest tradition of the Attorney Generals

Department, informed this Court that she is not contesting the count 02 in

the indictment levelled against the 1st Appellant.

In this case the investigation was conducted by the Crimes Prevention Unit

of the Director Crimes of the Police Head Quarters. The investigator had

failed to record statements from the Private Secretary and the Minister of

8 | P a g e

Agriculture and Livestock. These two witnesses are not only very important

but are very essential witnesses for the prosecution. Due to unknown reason,

the police had not taken any endeavor to recorded their statements and made

them as witnesses in this case. Further, this has completely escaped the

attention of the prosecution as well.

Considering all as discussed above, I conclude that prosecution had not

proven their case beyond reasonable doubt.

Therefore, I set aside the convictions and the sentence and allow the Appeal

of the Appellants.

The appeal is allowed and the Appellants are acquitted from the case.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Nuwara Eliya along with the original case record.
