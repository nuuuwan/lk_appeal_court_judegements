The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was charged and

thereafter convicted under Section 54A(d) and 54A(b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for being in possession

and trafficking 5.77 g of Diacetylmorphine (heroin) on 22nd of August 2019 at the High

Court of Colombo.

Prosecution led evidence from sixteen witnesses, marking productions P1 to P5, and

concluded the trial. The Accused gave a dock statement. After the conclusion of the trial,

the Learned High Court Judge pronounced the Accused guilty on both counts and

sentenced her to life imprisonment for each count.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Accused

preferred this appeal to this Court.

The Facts and circumstances are that;

PW1, Chandana Mahendra Bandara, the Police Inspector in charge of the raid,

testified that on 23rd of December 2013, as part of his daily routine, he had gone with his

team of officers to the location of Orugodawatta Majeed Place at 14:00. Upon arriving at

Page 3 of 6

Majeed Place, they parked the van near a temple. PW1 proceeded on foot with the other

officers for a short distance and entered Sattamma Garden, which was on the left-hand

side.

Subsequently, he saw a woman in a yellow floral dress coming down the staircase

of the apartment complex. After seeing PW1 she immediately turned away and started

going up the stairway, this raised suspicion. PW1 then proceeded to apprehend the woman

and handed her over to Lady Officer Anusha (PW10), who searched her and found a light

pink coloured cellophane bag in her right pocket. She handed the bag over to PW1.

Upon examining the cellophane bag, he discovered a brown powder and, based on

his expertise, identified it as heroin. After stating the allegations, the woman was arrested

at 14:35. The cellophane bag was taken into his custody, and he then placed it in an

envelope. They traveled to a pawn shop to weigh the substance; it weighed 20.340 grams.

They returned to the CCD at 15:50. The production was duly sealed, and it was handed

over to Reserve Duty Officer P.C. 47316 Jaynse (PW11) under production number

108/2013 (evidence marked as P2).

Further prosecution led evidence concerning the custody of the production by the

officers who held reserve duty until the production reached the government analyst

department on the 24th of December 2013. The Accused had given a dock statement.

The main objection taken by the defense was that the Learned Trial Judge had

failed to consider the fact that the prosecution had not established a chain of inward

journey.

We are mindful that our courts have insisted that there should be no doubt whether

the parcel containing the substance had been forwarded to the Government Analyst

without allowing room for any suspicion that it was tampered with or interfered with.

This issue was considered in the following cases.

In the case of Perera v. The Attorney General (1998) 1 SLR 378, His

Lordship J.A.N De Silva J(as he was) held that;

Page 4 of 6

It is a recognized principle that in a case of this nature, the prosecution must

prove that the productions had been forwarded to the Analyst from proper custody,

without allowing room for any suspicion that there had been no opportunity for

tampering or interfering with the production till they reach the Analyst. Therefore

it is correct to state that the most important journey is the inwards journey

because the final Analyst report will be depend on that. The outward journey does

not attract the same importance.

Also in the case of Witharana Doli Nona vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka C.A.

19/99 His Lordship Justice Sisira De Abrew remarked;

"It is a recognized principle that in drug related cases the prosecution must

prove the chain relating to the inward journey. The purpose of this principle is to

establish that the productions have [not] been tampered with. Prosecution must

prove that the productions taken from the accused appellant was examined by the

Government Analyst. To prove this, the prosecution must prove all the links of the

chain from the time it was taken from the possession of the accused appellant to

the Government Analyst's Department."

The above-said judgments were referred by His Lordship Malalgoda PC/J

(P/CA) In CA 16/2010 Mariyanayagan Norbertsingam v. Attorney General,

decided on 13.07.2015.

We are mindful of how the courts have scrutinized evidence placed by the

prosecution with regard to chain of custody.

It should be noted that according to PW1, he conducted several raids on that

day. Subsequently, he handed over productions 107/13 and 108/13 at two different

times. While he specified that production no. 107/13 was handed over to the

reserve at 13:40, he did not mention the time at which he handed over production

no. 108/13. Nonetheless, he was explicit that production no. 107/13 was

transferred at 13:40.

According to PW11, P.C. 47316 Jaynse, stated that he had reported to duty at

13:10, and he received the production 108/2013 from PW1 at 16:00.

Thereafter he handed the production 108/13 over to P.C. 39112 Jayasinghe (PW12)

who was in charge of the production room at 16:09.

During his cross-examination, he stated that he was on duty from 13:10 to 21:30.

According to him, PW1 had handed over production 107/13 to him at 13:50. We observe

that the following questions were put to the witness to confuse him.

PW12, P.C. 39112 Jayasinghe, was on duty from 8:00 to 17:00 and received the

production from PW11. When questioned by the defense, PW12 became confused about

the two productions, failing to specify to whom he had handed over production 108/13.

It is true that these are trained officers; however, we observe that the Counsel

for the Accused attempted to sow confusion by introducing two different productions.

Despite this, the officers were unequivocal regarding where, how, and what they had

received.

Page 6 of 6

PW15, P.S. 17037 Wijeratna, stated that he received the production from PW12

on December 24, 2013. He then handed over the production to the Government Analyst

and received receipt no. CB. 6144/13.

According to PW16 Wajira Jayasekara, the Government Analyst, PW15 had

transferred the production to the Government Analyst department.

Upon evaluating the evidence presented to the Learned Trial Judge, we find that

he correctly analyzed the evidence concerning the chain of production. Further, we

conclude that the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no

opportunity for tampering with the production until it reached the Government Analyst.

Therefore, we hold that no doubt has been cast on this basis.

We affirm that the prosecution has proven the charge against the Accused beyond

a reasonable doubt. The evidence presented in court was consistent with regard to the

charge, and the Accused's evidence did not cast any doubt against the prosecution's

version. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction, and this appeal is dismissed
