Introduction

[1] This is an appeal by way of a case stated against the determination of the

Tax Appeals Commission dated 23.01.2014 confirming the determination made

by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue on 16.07.2012. The Value

Added Tax (VAT) appeal relates to the monthly taxable periods from May 2006

(0062) to March 2008 (08033) made under section 34 of the Value Added Tax

Act, No. 14 of 2002.

Factual Background

[2] The Appellant is a limited liability company incorporated in Sri Lanka and

the Appellant is engaged in the provision of educational services. The Appellant

entered into an agreement with the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka in terms

of section 17 of the Board of Investment Law, No. 4 of 1978 (hereinafter referred

to as the BOI Law) to conduct and operate a business and set up an Information

Technology Training Institute for the offering of degrees, diplomas and

certificates duly affiliated to Asia Pacific Institute of Information Technology

(APIIT) of Malaysia, and Staffordshire University of the United Kingdom.

[3] The Appellant furnished returns under and in terms of the provisions of the

Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002, as amended (hereinafter referred to as

the VAT Act) for the taxable periods relevant to the assessments under appeal,

and claimed an exemption from Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as the

VAT) under section 8 of the VAT Act in respect of the educational services

provided by the Appellant as an Educational Establishment within the

meaning of section 83 of the VAT Act. By letter dated 23.06.2010, the assessor

3

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

rejected the claim of the Appellant for the VAT exemption and assessments

were made for the following reasons:

1. The Asia Pacific Institute of Information Technology Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd has not

provided vocational Training or practical training in the areas of Information

Technology, vocational training, management training, skills development

or training for foreign employment, textile and clothing, nursing, food

processing, agriculture, plantation or industrial;

2. According to the agreements and information were collected by the

department, the Asia Pacific Institute of Information Technology Lanka (Pvt.)

Ltd had conducted, without obtaining any prior approval from the Board of

Investment, the following business activities and therefore, the APIIT has

violated the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Supplementary

Agreements which were entered into with the BOI:

(I) APIIT has entered into agreements with

(a) Virtusa (Pvt.) Ltd;

(b) Celltel Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd;

(c) Mobitel Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd.

to lease part of the premises.

(II) APIIT has provided information technology consultancy services to

Expo Lanka Freight in Dubai;

(III) APIIT has entered into an agreement with the Ministry of Education

in Sri Lanka.

Appeal to the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue

[4] Being dissatisfied with the said assessments, the Appellant appealed against

the assessments to the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (hereinafter

referred to as the Respondent). The Respondent by its determination dated

16.07.2012 confirmed the assessments on the basis that the Appellant is in the

business of providing educational services and not conducting tertiary and

vocational education within the meaning of the VAT Act, and therefore the

Appellant is not entitled to the VAT exemption under section 8 of the VAT Act

(Vide- page 11 of the determination).

Appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission

[5] Being dissatisfied with the said assessments, the Appellant appealed against

the assessments to the Tax Appeals Commission (hereinafter referred to as the

TAC), and the TAC by its determination dated 23.01.2014 confirmed the

determination made by the Respondent and dismissed the appeal.

Questions of Law for the Opinion of the Court of Appeal

[6] Being dissatisfied with the said determination of the TAC, the Appellant

appealed to the Court of Appeal, and formulated the following questions of law

in the case stated for the opinion of the Court of Appeal:

1. Did the Commission err in law by allowing itself to be influenced/guided

by the provisions in the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, No. 20 of

1990 when the provisions in the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002

relating to the exemption claimed by the appellant namely, Paragraph (b)

(i) of part II of the first schedule to the Act read with Paragraph (d) of the

definition of Educational Establishment did not require reference to any

other enactment?

2. Did the Commission err in law in allowing itself to be influenced/guided

by the provisions in the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, No. 20 of

1990 for the determination of whether the appellant was an educational

establishment, referred to in paragraph (d) of the definition of

educational establishment, especially when the definition of educational

establishment, has two paragraphs, namely, Paragraphs (c) requiring

reference to the said Act and the other, namely, Paragraph (d) not

requiring such reference?

3. Did the Commission err in law in its failure to appreciate that, in relation

to the subject of Value Added Tax liability of a person, the Value Added

Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002 is a special Act, the provisions of which supersede

the provisions in any other Act on the basis of the principle of

interpretation specialia generalibus derogant?

4. Did the Commission err in law when it rejected the claim of the appellant

for exemption for the reason that the appellant had not provided, inter

5

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

aila, tertiary education as well when the said provisions of the Value

Added Tax Act did not require the provision of tertiary education?

5. Did the Commission err in law when it failed to determine the issue of

exemption claimed by the appellant solely by reference to the intrinsic

terms of the relevant provisions of the Value Added Tax Act referred to

earlier?

6. a). Did the Commission err in failing to appreciate that there is a difference

between Vocational Education in the Tertiary and Vocational Education

Act and Vocational Training in the Value Added Tax Act?

b). If so did the Commission err in incorrectly applying and/or relying on

the provisions in the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act in arriving at

its determination?

7. Did the Commission err in law when it rejected the claim for exemption

on the basis of the following inferences which are totally unsupported by

any evidence,

a) That the reason why the appellant did not register itself under the

Tertiary and Vocational Education Act is that it did not provide

tertiary education and vocational education.

b) Under the setting provided by the Tertiary and Vocational Education

Act it is doubtful whether the appellant would be willing to subject

itself to the supervision and control created by that Act.

8. Having acknowledged at page 7 of the determination that material was

produced on behalf of the appellant in order to show that the appellant

provided practical training and skills development etc. did the

Commission err in law in its failure to decide the issue of exemption on

the basis of, inter alia, the material so produced?

9. Did the Commission err in law when in the determination of the issue of

exemption it has taken into account irrelevant and extraneous

considerations namely, that,

a) The appellant has violated the provisions of the agreement it had

with the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka.

6

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

b) That it failed to reduce the fees charged from the students even after

the receiving of a ruling from the Deputy Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue (VAT) to the effect that the appellant is exempt from

VAT; and

c) That the appellant failed to provide a certificate from the Board of

Investment.

10. With regard to the plea of estoppel raised on behalf of the appellant on

the basis of the ruling given by the Deputy Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue (VAT) to the effect that the appellant is exempt from VAT,

did the Commission err in law in rejecting the plea on the basis of the

inference that it is not a ruling issued after examining all the matters

relating to the exemption, when such inference is not supported by any

evidence at all?

11. a) Did the Commission err in law in its conclusion that the appellant

cannot legally conduct tertiary and vocational education without

complying with the provisions of the Tertiary and Vocational Education

Act when legality is not a requirement under the provisions of the Value

Added Tax Act or under any revenue legislation at all?

b) In any event was such a finding not relevant to the determination of

the matters before the Commission?

12. Instead of considering the material produced on behalf of the appellant

to show that the appellant has provided vocational training or practical

training in the area of information technology etc. did the Commission

err in law in concluding that no vocational or practical training is provided

by the appellant on the basis of the erroneous belief that the appellant is

only a Graduate School providing Masters Programmes, which belief is

contrary to the material produced on behalf of the appellant?

13. Did the Commission err in failing to appreciate that vocational training

does not cease to be vocational training merely by reason of the fact that

a degree or other qualification may ultimately be granted by the

Appellant?

7

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

14. In any event, even on the face of the provisions in the Tertiary and

Vocational Education Act, was the Appellant not in violation of the said

Act?

15. Having regard, in the absence of a definition of vocational training or

practical training in the Value Added Tax Act, to the ordinary meaning

of vocational training (which is not different from the meaning of the

words as given in the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act) and practical

training, is not the appellant an educational establishment providing, inter

alia vocational or practical training in the areas of information

technology?

16. Did the Appellant in any event provide practical training?

17. Even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that the appellant did not

provide vocational training, is not the appellant still entitled to the

exemption granted by the Value Added Tax Act for the reason that the

definition of educational establishment in the VAT Act requires the

presence of vocational training OR practical training and that the

appellant provided such practical training?

18. In the circumstances of this matter, is the Appellant not liable to pay VAT?

19. Did the Commission fail to properly examine and/or apply and/or

appreciate the facts relevant to this matter?

[7] The TAC dismissed the Appellants appeal on the following grounds:

1. The Appellant is a graduate School offering Post-Graduate Degrees,

Diplomas and Masters Degrees in Information Technology, but not

providing vocational education or practical training as it is evident from

the Website of the Appellant;

2. The registration by the Appellant under the Tertiary and Vocational

Education Act is mandatory for the exemption but the Appellant was not

registered under the said Act, and therefore, the Appellant cannot be

regarded as an Educational Establishmentment providing vocational or

practical training under paragraph (d) of section 83 of the definition of

Educational Establishment of the VAT Act;

8

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

3. The Gazette Extraordinary No. 887/8 of 07.09.1995 issued in terms of the

Tertiary and Vocational Education Act highlights the importance that has

been accorded to tertiary and vocational education in the country, and

the VAT exemption has been given to promote more institutions

registered under the Vocational Education Act to engage in tertiary and

vocational education;

4. The Appellant has failed to submit the Review Certificate from the BOI

to the Inland Revenue Department, to the effect that it has fulfilled all

the conditions laid down in paragraph d of the definition, for the

purpose of being considered as an Educational Establishment.

5. The Appellant has not reduced its fees after receipt of the exemption

from VAT, and while claiming exemption from VAT, retained the VAT

collected from the students, on behalf of the Government.

[8] On 09.07.2018, it was agreed and recorded that the three connected cases,

CATax/05/2014, CA/Tax/04/2014 and CA/Tax/24/2014 would be taken up for

argument together and the parties would be bound by such judgment in

respect of the other two matters CA/Tax/04/2014 and CA/Tax/24/2014).

[9] At the hearing of the appeal, Dr. Romesh de Silva, the learned Presidents

Counsel for the Appellant and Mr. Milinda Gunatilleke, Additional Solicitor

General for the Respondent made extensive oral submissions on the questions

of law submitted for the opinion of the Court and filed further filed written

submissions. Dr. Romesh de Silva submitted that the TAC erred in holding that

the Appellant was only offering Post-Graduate Degrees, Diplomas and Maters

Degrees in Information Technology but was not providing vocational training

or practical training, when it was clearly demonstrated by the documents

marked A1-A2 that the Appellant conducted practical training as a part of the

courses offered by the Appellant during the relevant periods. He further

submitted that the TAC erred in holding that the Appellant could not have

conducted vocational or practical training in the area of information technology

without registering under the Vocational Education Act, No. 20 of 1990, when

it is crystal clear that the definition of Educational Establishment in the VAT

Act does not require registration under the Tertiary and Vocational Education

Act.

9

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

[10] He strenuously contended that the Appellant has presented material before

the TAC to demonstrate that practical training and skills development were

provided in the training programs conducted by the Appellant. He further

submitted that the Appellant had given details of the theoretical lecture hours

as well as the practical hours and therefore the Appellant falls within paragraph

(d) of the definition of Educational Establishment in section 83 of the VAT Act.

He further submitted that the TAC has totally ignored the syllabi and mistakenly

decided that registration by the Appellant under the Tertiary and Vocational

Education Act, No. 20 of 1990 is a mandatory requirement for the eligibility of

the VAT exemption when it is clear that the VAT Act makes no reference to the

Tertiary and Vocational Education Act.

[11] Dr. de Silva strenuously argued that all what the Appellant had to establish

was that the Appellant is providing either vocational training or practical

training, and if the Appellant established that it provided practical training in

the areas of information technology, it is eligible for the exemption in terms of

the definition of Educational Establishment in section 83 of the VAT Act. He

further submitted that practical training is a part of the Appellants Information

Technology Institute, and no program in the information technology can be

conducted without practical training being given to the students who follow

such courses in information technology.

[12] On the other hand, Mr. Gunatilleke submitted that since the terms

vocational training and practical training are not defined in the VAT Act, the

TAC was correct in relying on the criteria that should be satisfied by any

educational institution under the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, No. 20

of 1990 (hereinafter referred to as the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act).

He submitted that in terms of the provisions of sections 14, 15 and 16 of the

Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, the registration of any institute for the

provision of tertiary and vocational education or conducting any tertiary and

vocational education course or conducting any examination for conferring or

granting any tertiary education award or vocational education award is

mandatory.

[13] He submitted that the Appellant is not registered under the Tertiary and

Vocational Education Act and, therefore, the Appellant could not have

established, managed, conducted any tertiary or vocational education

course under the provisions of the said Act. He argued therefore, that the

ordinary meaning of vocational training or practical training in the VAT Act

10

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

is not different from the meaning of the words as given in the Tertiary and

Vocational Education Act, and therefore, the two Acts are in pari materia. He

argued that the meaning of vocational and practical training in the VAT Act

must be interpreted by reference to the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act.

On that basis, he argued that the Appellant who failed to register as an

educational institution providing vocational educational or practical training

under the provisions of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act cannot be

regarded as an Educational Establishment referred to in paragraph (d) of the

definition of Educational Establishment of the VAT Act.

Analysis

Statutory provisions

[14] Before embarking upon the rival contentions of the parties, I may proceed

to consider the relevant statutory provisions which have a bearing on the issue.

The scope for the imposition of VAT is provided for in section 2 of the VAT Act.

Section 2 of the VAT Act provides that-

subject to the provisions of the VAT Act, the VAT shall be charged-

(a) at the time of supply, on every taxable supply of goods or services made

in a taxable period, by a registered person in the course of the carrying on, or, or carrying out, of a taxable activity by such person in Sri Lanka; (b) on the importation of goods into Sri Lanka, by any person,

and on the value of such goods or services supplied or the goods imported,

as the case may be subject to the provision of section 2A, at the following rates-.. [15] In terms of section 2 of the VAT Act, in order to render the relevant supply

of goods and services liable to VAT, the said supply has to be a taxable supply

of goods or services made by a registered person and made in the course of

carrying out a taxable activity.

Exemption of Educational Establishment

[16] Section 8 of the VAT Act as amended reads as follows:

No tax shall be charged on the supply of goods or services and the importation of goods specified in the First Schedule to this Act as such supplies and imports are not taxable unless zero rated under section 7:

11

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

[17] Section 83 of the VAT Act defines the Educational Services as follows:

Educational services means the provision of services by any person or

partnership in relation to education, vocational training or retraining.

[18] The supply of educational services by an educational establishment is a

supply of services within the meaning of the First Schedule, Part I paragraph (vi)

of the Inland Revenue Act. It reads:

(vi) The supply of educational services by an educational establishment or

government schools or schools funded by the government.

[19] The Appellant is claiming the exemption from VAT under section 17 of the

Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act, No. 8 of 2006, which amended section 83

of the VAT Act, by expanding the definition of an Educational Establishment

which exempted an Educational Establishment from the imposition of VAT.

The definition of Educational Establishment in section 83 of the VAT Act was

amended by the Value Added (Amendment) Act, No. 13 of 2004 and the Value

Added (Amendment) Act, No. 8 of 2006. The definition of Educational

Establishment in section 83 of the VAT Act as amended by the Value Added

(Amendment) Act, No. 13 of 2004 and the Value Added (Amendment) Act, No.

8 of 2006 provides:

Educational Establishment means-

(a) A higher educational institution established under the University Act, No.

16 of 1978 or the Buddhist and Pali Universities Act, No. 74 of 1981; (b) any recognized institution providing vocational training or training for

persons engaged in any trade, profession or employment and includes an incorporated examination body; (c) any institution providing vocational training or practical training and-

(i) provided with funds or other assistance by the Government and approved by the Minister in charge of the subject of Tertiary Education and Training in consultation with the Minister, as an institution providing such training;and (ii) where the surplus funds of such institution are reinvested in the maintenance of such institution.

12

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

(d) An institution which has entered into an agreement with the Board

of Investment of Sri Lanka under section 17 of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law, No. 4 of 1978, with a minimum investment of not less than rupees fifteen million providing vocational training or practical training in the areas of information technology, vocational training, management training, skills development or training for foreign employment, textile and clothing, nursing, food processing, agricultural plantation or industrial. [20] In terms of paragraph (d) of the definition of Educational Establishment

in section 83 of the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act, No. 8 of 2006, the

Appellant must fulfill the following requirements to be eligible for the VAT

exemption:

1. The Appellant has entered into an agreement with the Board of Investment

of Sri Lanka under section 17 of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law,

No. 4 of 1978;

2. The Appellant has made a minimum investment of not less than rupees

fifteen million;

3. The Appellant was engaged in providing-

(i) Vocational training or practical training in the areas of information

technology;

(ii) Vocational training, management training, skills development; or

(iii) Training for foreign employment, textile and clothing, nursing, food

processing, agricultural plantation or industrial.

[21] In terms of the third requirement, it would be sufficient for the Appellant

to establish that it was engaged in providing either vocational training or

practical training in the areas of information technology. It is not in dispute that

the Appellant had entered into an Agreement with the Board of Investment of

Sri Lanka under section 17 of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law, No. 4

of 1978 (BOI Law). It is also not in dispute that the Appellant has invested a

minimum of Rs. 15 million.

Issue

[22] The main issue for the decision is whether the Appellant provided

vocational training or practical training in the areas of information technology

13

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

to be eligible for the exemption within the definition of Educational

Establishment in paragraph d of section 83 of the VAT Act (as amended).

Whether APIIT provides vocational training or practical training in the

areas of Information Technology

[23] The term vocation is defined in the Compact Oxford Dictionary Thesaurus,

Indian Edition, 2006 as follows:

a persons employment, esp. regarded as requiring dedication/ a trade or

profession.

(ii) Blacks Law Dictionary (7th Edition) defines Vocation as follows:

Vocation. A persons regular calling or business; ones occupation or

profession.

[24] Strouds Judicial Dictionary (8th Edition) defines Vocational Training as

follows:

VOCATIONAL TRAINING.Those years of an educational course which, taken in isolation, could not be regarded as vocational training within the meaning of the EEC Treaty were, none the less, to be so regarded if the whole course, of which they formed part, constituted a preparation for a qualification for a particular profession, trade or employment, or which provided the necessary skills for such profession, trade or employment (Gravier v City of Liege (1985) E.C.R. 593; Belgiam State v. Humbel, 263/86 (1988) E.C.R.5365). University education in veterinary medicine is vocational training (Blaizol v University of Liege (No. 24/86) (1989) 1 C.M.L.R. 57). [25] The term practicalis also defined in the Compact Oxford Dictionary

Thesaurus, Indian Edition, 2006 as follows:

of or concerned with practice or use rather than theory/suited to use of

action.

[26] A perusal of the BOI Agreement No. 006 dated 10.06.2006 reveals that by

application dated 17.06.1999, the Appellant sought approval of the BOI to

conduct and operate a business to set up an Information Technology

Training Institute for offering of degrees, diplomas and certificates duly

affiliated to Asia Pacific Institute of Information Technology (APIIT) of Malaysia

and Staffordshire University of U.K. The BOI granted approval to the Appellant

to conduct and operate a business to set up an Information Technology

14

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

Training Institute subject to the terms and conditions referred to in the Boards

letter dated 08.07.1999, and subject to the terms and conditions set out in the

BOI. In terms of the approval granted to the Appellant, the Appellant shall have

the following rights:

(a) setup/conduct and/or operate the said business at the said premises after

obtaining clearance and approval from the Board in respect of

Environmental and Engineering aspects including the site and also be

subject to the prior approval from the relevant authorities..;

(b) commence commercial operations within a period of six (06) months from

the date hereof;

(c) train not less than three hundred (300) persons annually;

(d) offer degrees only on its being duly affiliated to the Asia Pacific Institute

of Information Technology (APIIT) of Malaysia and the University of

Staffordshire of the United Kingdom;and

(e) .

[27] Clause 10 (vi) of the Agreement provides that the Appellant shall be

entitled to the tax concession for a period of 5 years on the following specific

undertakings of the Enterprise-

(a) That it shall provide training for not less than Three Hundred (300)

persons per annum;

(b) That it shall offer degrees only on its being duly affiliated to the Asia

Pacific Institute of Information Technology (APIIT) of Malaysia and the

University of Staffordshire of the U.K.

[28] The TAC however, solely relied on the Appellants Web Site that refers to

the Appellant as a Graduate School offering two distinctive MSC

Programms. i.e.. Master of Science in computing (MSC. In computing) and

Master of Science in Technology (MSC in Technology Management), and

concluded that the Appellant is only a Graduate School providing Post

Graduate Degrees, Diplomas and Master's degrees in Information Technology

(pp. 12-13 of the TAC determination. The findings of the TAC are as follows:

With regard to this matter, the Representative for the Respondent has referred us to the Web Site of the Appellant which states that, it is a graduate

15

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

School offering two distinctive MSC Programms. i.e.. Master of Science in computing (MSC. In computing) and Master of Science in technology (MSC in Technology management). Even in the Web Site of Asia Pacific Institute of Information Technology, Malaysia, the mother company of the Appellant, there is no mention or reference that it is conducting Tertiary and Vocational Education courses, whereas it is also very clear that, it is a Graduate School providing Post-graduate Degrees, Diplomas and Masters Degrees in Information Technology.

[29] The TAC has not considered whether in terms of the BOI Agreement, the

Appellants Information Technology Training Institute has in fact provided

practical training, not less than three hundred (300) persons annually in the

areas of information technology by reference to the curriculum submitted by

the Appellant to the TAC.

[30] The Appellants position as per written submissions filed before the TAC

(A1) dated 24.06.2011 before the TAC was that:

A- During the period for which assessments have been raised, APIIT

conducted the following training Programmes:

a. Diploma in Information and Communication Technology;

b. Diploma in Business Administration;

c. BSc (Hons) Computing;

d. BSc (Hons) Computing (Software Engineering)

e. BSc (Hons) Business Information Technology

f. BA (Hons) Business Administration

B- All these programmes are highly job-oriented programmes that provide

practical training and skills development to prepare students for employment

immediately upon completion of the training. Trainees in Information

Technology are given extensive practical training in a host of IT skills so that

they can be readily employed in technical/vocational jobs in areas such as

network administration, software engineering, software development, quality

assurance, web development, database administration and business analysis;

C- Trainees in Business Administration are provided with management

training to impart managerial and business skills to enable them to secure

managerial jobs such as management trainee, executive and manager;

D-curriculum of the programmes provides evidence for practical training and

skills development in Information Technology in the context of

16

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

Computing/Information, Technology training programmes and management

training and relevant skills development in the context of Business

Administration training programmes.

[31] A Copy of the Appellants Web Site relied on by the TAC clearly refers to

three educational components of the Appellant:

1. School of Computing;

2. Business School; and

3. Graduate School.

[32] The web site contains several features-Home, About us, Careers, Contact

use, Site map etc. The Respondent has only produced the page relating to the

Graduate School offering two Masters Programmes:

(a) Master of Science in Computing (MSC in Computing);

(b) Master of Science in Technology Management (MSC in Technology

Management).

[33] The page relating to the School of Computing and Business School has

not been provided to the TAC. The TAC only relied on the web page relating

to Graduate School and held that the Appellant is only a Graduate School

offering Post-Graduate Degrees, Diplomas and Masters Degrees in

Information Technology. The TAC failed to examine the courses offered by the

School of Computing and Business School and the relevant syllabus to

ascertain whether the School of Computing or Business School provided

practical training in the areas of information technology.

[34] Apart from the evidence contained in the Agreement which provides that

the Appellants Information Technology Training Institute shall provide training

for not less than 300 persons per annum, the Appellant filed written

submissions dated 24.06.2011 (A1) and annexed inter alia, the following

documents (A1(i)-A1(iv) and A2):

Annexure 1- Practical training & skills development in Information

Technology Training Programmes conducted at APIIT (A1(i);

Annexure 2- Management Training and skills development in the

Business Administration Training Programs conducted at APIIT (A1(ii)

17

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

Annexure 3- Vocational nature of APIIT Training Programmes, comparison

of University of Vocational Technology Awards with APIIT in Information

Technology (A1(iii).

[35] Dr. de Silva, referring to the written submissions and the annexures [A1(1)-

A1(iii)] filed by the Appellant before the TAC submitted that the Appellant

conducted and provided practical training program in the Information

Technology leading to the grant of diplomas and degrees. Annexure 1 (A (1)(i)

sets out the Computing/Information Technology programmes highlighting the

practical training and skills development in Information Technology. The

Respondent did not dispute the position of the Appellant that the Appellant

submitted its written submissions to the TAC on 24.06.2011 (A1) with the

documents marked A1 (A1(i)-A1(iv) to show that the Appellant is an

Educational Establishment providing vocational and practical training in the

areas of Information Technology.

[36] The TAC in its determination accepts that in order to show that the

Appellant is an Educational Establishment providing vocational and practical

training in the areas of Information Technology, the Appellant provided

material giving details of theoretical lecture hours and practical lecture hours.

The TAC states at page 7 of the TAC brief:

In order to show that the Appellants educational establishment is providing vocational and practical training in the area of information technology, the Representative referred in detail, to the course of studies provided by the Appellant. The Representative also provided material to show that practical training and skill development are also provided in the training programmes conducted by the Appellant, giving details of theoretical lecture hours and practical lecture hours. In addition, the Representative referred to the dictionary meanings given to certain words that are given in the definition such as training, vocational education, information technology, management, training, skills to show that the Appellant is providing vocational and practical training in the area of information technology and providing management training and skills development.

[37] The TAC has, however, totally disregarded the detailed material submitted

by the Appellant in regard to the practical training and skill development

conducted by the Appellant, the theoretical lecture hours and practical lecture

hours in the area of information technology referred to in the Appellants

document marked A1 and A2. They deal with the following practical training

9. Appendix A2 (Addendum) describes the physical resources available to

support practical training and skills development including, lecture rooms,

tutorial rooms, 17 computer laboratories with a seating capacity of 170,

syndicate rooms, study rooms and libraries.

10. Computer laboratories

The Appellant A2 (p.20) has 5 computer laboratories with 171 personal

computers for student use, and all computers are equipped with the latest

PC configuration and are provided with high speed internet access and a

wide range of software. All labs are assisted by trained technical staff (see

Table 4 which details list of computer laboratory resources and technical

infrastructure available to support practical training and skills

development).

[38] The document marked A2 (Addendum) depicts the percentage of contact

hours and independent learning hours across the above mentioned three levels

of the computing programmes. Table 2, in particular depicts the allocation of

contact hours amongst lectures, laboratory sessions and tutorial classes for the

computing degree as follows:

Level Lectures Laboratory

Sessions

Tutorials Total Contact

Hours

Level

1

406 (60%) 112 (17%) 154 (23%) 672

Level

2

168 (56%) 60 (20%) 72 (24%) 300

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

Level

3

112 (57%) 72 (37%) 12 (6%) 196

[39] According to Table 2, the students are required to use the computer

laboratories to develop their practical experience by applying the knowledge

acquired through lectures and tutorial classes. Table 3 further illustrates the

independent learning hours spent by the students on different learning

activities, which clearly demonstrates that the Appellant is providing practical

training at different levels of the programmes.

[40] The Respondent did not challenge the contents of the document marked

A1 and A2 submitted to the TAC and the TAC also did not question the

genuineness of those documents. It is crystal clear that the Appellant provides

practical training in the areas of information technology and modern computer

facilities are available to support practical training and skills development.

[41] The VAT Act, however, does not lay down the degree of practical training,

whether it is 100%, 75%, 50%, 25% or 10% and what is required is that any

educational institution shall conduct vocational or practical training in the

areas of information technology. One cannot understand as to how the

Appellants School of Computing could have conducted the computer

Degree Programmes/Computing/Software Engineering programme or ICT

related Business Information Technology Progrmmes solely on 100% practical

training without providing both theoretical-based ICT-related

principles/concepts and practical training in computer laboratories listed in

A1and A2.

[42] On the strength of the material presented by the Appeelant, it is

inconceivable for any educational course in the area of information technology

to be conducted by any School of Computing at any level leading to either

Post-Graduate Degrees or Diplomas solely on theory disregarding any

computer laboratory based practical training. No explanation has been given

by the TAC for the justification of the conclusion that the Appellants courses

are only academically oriented but no practical training was provided

disregarding very clear and comprehensive material provided by the Appellant

before the TAC.

[43] The TAC has decided that the Appellant is not providing vocational

educational courses and practical training without examining the practical

22

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

training and skills development provided by the Appellant at different levels

of the programmes in terms of student learning hours and the physical

resources (computer equipment and facilities with technical staff) referred to

in Addumdum-A2. No reference has been made to the physical resources and

5 computer laboratories with 171 trained technicians for students use and

support such practical training and skills development.

[44] The Appellant has presented sufficient material and established that it

conducted laboratory-based practical training in the areas of information

technology, such as laboratory-based training on programming, computer

systems, databases, networking and software developments and skills

development (A1and A2).

[45] I hold that the Appellant has clearly established that the Appellant

provided practical training to students at different levels of the programmes

conducted by the Appellant in the areas of information. I hold that the TAC

erred in holding that the Appellant was only a Graduate School provides Post-

graduate Degrees, Diplomas and Masters degrees in Information technology

not providing practical training in the area of information technology. For

those reasons, I hold that the Appellant is an Educational Establishment

within the meaning of the paragraph (d) of the definition of Educational

Establishment in section 83 of the VAT Act and, therefore, the Appellant is

entitled to the exemption from VAT granted by the VAT Act.

Applicability of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, No. 20 of 1990 and the Registration of the Appellant under the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, No. 20 of 1990 to the VAT Exemption

[46] The next question is whether the TAC was correct in holding that the

registration by the Appellant under the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act

is a mandatory requirement for the VAT exemption in terms of the provisions

of the VAT Act.

[47] The TAC in its determination held that the in terms of the provisions of

sections 14(1), 15(1) and 16 (1) of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act

the registration is mandatory for establishing, managing, running or

controlling any institute providing tertiary and vocational education, and since

the Appellant has not registered under the provisions of the said Act, the

Appellant is not eligible for the exemption under the VAT Act. The findings of

the TAC at pp. 10-11 of the determination are as follows:

23

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

It is very clear from the three sections referred to above i.e. sections 14(1), 15(1) and 16(1) that the use of the word shall requires the mandatory registration of any institute providing tertiary education and vocational education, conducting such courses and conducting examinations for conferring awards. It is not a directory. It is also important to note the criteria for registration provided in the Education Act, Section 14(4) which states as follows:..

Further, in the Gazette referred above, under criteria for registration, states that The underlying principle, therefore, is the ability of the applicant institute to adequately provide training in conformity with the criteria set out in the Development Plan.

In addition, the Education Act has empowered the Director-General to apply to Court, in terms of section 29 of the Education Act, to prevent any violations and to punish the offenders in terms of section 91 of the said Act.

In view of these mandatory provisions in the Education Act, including the penal provisions, the relevant question to be asked from the Appellant is why their Education Institution was not registered, as required by law. Further, it is very unlikely that an educational institution such as the Appellant Company where, obedience to the law has to be considered as paramount, not only to the students but also to the institution, would have violated the law of the land. The possible explanation or the reasonable inference that could be drawn from such conduct is that, the Appellant Company did not register it, as it was only a Graduate School providing Masters Programmes and that it did not provide tertiary education and vocational education.

[48] It is not in dispute that the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act was

passed by Parliament to provide for the establishment of a tertiary and

vocational education commission, provide for plans for the development of

tertiary education and vocational education and its implementation thereof

and for the establishment of a national and industrial training authority. In

terms of sections 14(1), 15(1) and 16(1), the registration of any institute for the

provision of tertiary education and vocational education is mandatory. The

relevant provisions regarding registration under the Tertiary and Vocational

Education Act are as follows:

14(1) No person shall, establish, manage, run or control any institute for the provision of tertiary education and vocational education, or tertiary education or vocational education without being registered under this Act. 15(1) No person or establishment shall conduct any tertiary education and vocational education course or tertiary education course or vocational

24

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

education course being a specified course without being registered under this Act.

16(1) No person or establishment shall conduct any examination for

conferring or granting any tertiary education award or vocational education

award, without being registered with the Director-General under this Act.

[49] The meaning of Tertiary education and Vocational Education are given

in Gazette Extraordinary No. 887/8 of 07.09.1995 issued by the Tertiary &

Vocational Education Commission. It reads as follows:

Tertiary education is defined as post-secondary education and/or training imparted to persons to prepare and fit for an occupation/profession or for the purpose of further study in a university or similar institution. Vocational education is defined as education and or training imparted to persons for the acquisition of knowledge, operative skill, technical or craft skill or of experience needed for the pursuit of an occupation or trade.

[50] The TAC has further relied on the Gazette dated 07.09.1995 issued in terms

of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act and disallowed the exemption on

the ground that the VAT exemption has been granted to promote more

institutions to engage in tertiary and vocational education in Sri Lanka. The

said Gazette dated 07.09.1995 issued in terms of the Tertiary and Vocational

Education Act details the rationale, and objectives of registration of a tertiary

and vocational education institute as follows:

In the economic setting, dramatic changes have taken place under open economic policies introduced after 1977. Consequently, attention has been increasingly directed towards the need for the education and training and training system to adapt adequately, responding to the needs of the changing economic environment. The government is well aware of these economic imperatives and the need for rationalization of resources in the system for better organization of training provision in keeping with the changing human resource needs of the economy. The government is ready to introduce new schemes to realise these needs

and is equally committed to extract the maximum benefits from the already established institutes providing tertiary and vocational educational and training in the country through policy interventions in the areas of planning and co-ordination. The Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, No. 20 of 1990 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) provides the policy and

25

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

institutional framework to ensure that the country gets the best returns from the investments made to establish an institutional training. [51] The said Gazette was issued on 07.09.1995 and the VAT Act was passed

thereafter and therefore, there cannot be any reference to the VAT Act. No

subsequent Gazette referring to the VAT Act has been produced by the

Respondent in its submissions before us. In terms of clause 2.1 of the said

Gazette, to be considered for registration, the applicant should satisfy the

Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission the following criteria:

(a) has an established location and a regular office or place of business;

(b) has caused the name of the institute and the address painted or affixed

in legible characters in the language in which the courses are

conducted, in a conspicuous place at or near the entrance to the

institute;

(c) provides classroom accommodation, workshops, library and recreation

areas and office rooms commensurate with the student population and

nature of the courses conducted;

(d) provides basic amenities such as drinking water, lighting, fire

protection facilities, first-aid-facilities, sanitation etc, commensurate

with the student population and the nature of courses conducted;

(e) uses curricula and syllabi which are valid and adequate and conforming

to established standards accepted by the Commission;

(f) utilizes machinery, equipment, tools, atc. Required to effectively impart

the knowledge and skills contents of each course;

(g) employs appropriate teaching methods and aids in the teaching

process;

(h) employs valid and adequate methods and aids in the teaching process;

(i) has a sufficient number of management personnel including Principals,

Directors of Students, etc. as the case may be, commensurate with the

size of the student population and the level of the courses;

(j) has constantly abided by the provisions of the constitution under which

the institute has been established;

(k) employs effective methods of selection which ensure the recruitment

of applicants with correct aptitude for each course;

(l) adheres to accepted norms and guidelines issued by the Commission

in exhibiting notices and advertisements offering courses of studies;

(m) adheres to accepted norms and guidelines issued by the Commission

in exhibiting notices and advertisements offering courses of studies;

26

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

(n) provides counselling and guidance services to students, arranges for

on the job/hands on experience with the industry whereever applicable

and evaluates the effectiveness of training provided;and

(o) the institute is properly managed adhering to sound management

approaches and maintaining effective academic, financial and

administration methods and procedures.

[52] It is not in dispute that the Appellant has not registered in terms of the

provisions of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act and no action has been

taken by the Director-General of the Tertiary Education and Vocational

Educational Commission against the Appellant for the failure to register the

Appellants institute under the provisions of the Tertiary and Vocational

Education Act.

[53] The Appellant has been granted approval by the BOI to conduct and

operate an Information Technology Training Institute for offering degrees,

diplomas and certificates duly affiliated to APIIT, Malaysia under section 17 of

the BOI Act, and the Appellant has invested a minimum sum of Rs. 1.5 Million

in respect of its business. If these conditions are satisfied, the Appellant would

be entitled to income tax exemption for a period of time as determined by the

BOI.

[54] It is relevant to note that the words tertiary and education are found

only in the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, but such words are not

found in the definition of Educational Establishment in paragraph (d) of

section 83 of the VAT Act. The only common word in both Acts is the word

vocational. The VAT exemption is applicable if the Appellant has provided

vocational or practical training in the fields referred to in the definition of

Educational Establishment in paragraph (d) of section 83 of the VAT Act.

There is no requirement to prove that the Appellant provides both the

vocational and practical training to qualify for the VAT exemption under the

VAT Act. Accordingly, in the present case, the requirement of vocational or

practical training in the field of information technology is the basis of the VAT

exemption. On the other hand, the requirement of tertiary or vocational

education is the basis of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act.

[55] There is nothing to indicate in the VAT Act that the VAT exemption is

inapplicable to any BOI approved undertaking unless such undertaking has

registered under the provisions of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act

27

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

or provided tertiary or vocational education within the meaning of the

Tertiary and Vocational Education Act.

[56] If it was the intention of the legislature that the VAT exemption is subject

to the registration of the educational institution under the provisions of the

Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, it could have easily referred to the

Tertiary and Vocational Education Act. It is not in dispute that the VAT Act or

its subsequent amendments make no reference to the Tertiary and Vocational

Education Act. Despite the fact that the Appellant had placed sufficient

evidence before the TAC that it provides practical training in the field of

information technology at all levels of its computer-related degrees, Diplomas

and Certificates, the TAC erroneously proceeded to consider the registration

by the Appellant under the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act is a

mandatory requirement for the VAT exemption.

[57] The Appellant has taken up the position that the VAT Act is a special Act

and thus, its provisions supersede the provisions of the Tertiary and Vocational

Education Act on the basis of the principle of interpretation specialia

generalibus derogant (Question of Law, No. 3). On the other hand, Mr.

Gunatillekes submission was that VAT Act does not need to make a specific

reference to the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, as it is implicit that for

any institution to legally carry out tertiary or vocational training education, they

need to be registered under the provisions of that Act. His contention was that

the principle of in pari materia applies when the definition of the term

vocational training or practical training is not found in the VAT Act, and

therefore, the TAC was correct in allowing itself to be guided by the provisions

of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act in disallowing the exemption.

Maxim specialia generalibus derogant

[58] I will first consider the Maxim specialia generalibus derogant. The

maxim generalia specialibus non derogant means that when there is a conflict

between a general and a special provision, the latter shall prevail. For the

purposes of interpretation of two statutes in apparent conflict, the provisions

of a general statute must yield to those of a special one. The said principle has

been defined in Craies on Statute Law, Fifth Ed. P. 205 thus:

The rule is, that whenever, there is a particular enactment and general enactment in the same statute, and the latter,taken in its most comprehensive sense, would overrule the former, the particular enactment must be operative,

28

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

and the general enactment must be taken to affect only the other parts of the statute to which it may properly apply.

[59] This rule of construction is, however, subject to the condition that there is

nothing in the general provision, expressed or implied, indicating an intention

to the contrary (Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes. 11th Ed. pp. 166-169).

This rule has also been applied as between different provisions of the same

statute or two separate statutes in numerous cases to resolve a conflict

between a specific provision and a general provision (J. K. Cotton Spinning and

Weaving Mills Co. Ltd v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1961 1170 at p. 1174).

[60] I do not consider that this is at all a clear case for the application of the

maxim generalia specialibus non derogant, when there is no inconsistency or

conflict between the two Acts. In my view, the two statutes have been enacted

for different objects, purposes, and the scheme of the two statutes is distinct

with each other and thus, the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant has no

application.

[61] The VAT Act as amended, however, defines the term educational

establishment in four different subparagraphs. It is relevant to note that the

definition of Educational Establishment was limited in the original VAT Act,

No. 14 of 2002 to (a) a higher educational institution established under the

University Act, No. 16 of 1978 or the Buddhist and Pali Universities Act, No. 74

of 1981; (b) any recognised institution providing vocational training or training

for persons engaged in any trade, profession or employment and includes an

incorporated examination body.

[62] This definition was expanded by the VAT (Amendment) Act, No. 13 of 2004

as follows:

(c) any institution providing vocational training or practical training, and

(i) provided with funds or other assistance by the Government and approved by the Minister in charge of the subject of Tertiary Education and Training in consultation with the Minister, as an institution providing such training; and

(ii) where the surplus funds of such institution are reinvested in the maintenance of such institution .

[63] This definition was further expanded by the VAT (Amendment) Act, No. 8

of 2006 as follows:

29

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

(d) an institution which has entered into an agreement with the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka under section 17 of the Board of Investment of [s 20 of 7 of 2003]2 [s 13 of 7 of 2014] [s 18 (2) of 13 of 2004]3 [s 17(1) of 8 of 2006]4 Value Added Tax Act - Consolidation 2014 88 Sri Lanka Law No. 4 of 1978, with a minimum investment of not less than rupees fifteen million providing vocational training or practical training in the areas of information technology, vocational training, management training, skills development or training for foreign employment, textile and clothing, nursing, food processing, agricultural plantation or industrial.

[64] The Gazette issued under the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act

defines the term vocational education as education and or training imparted

to persons for the acquisition of knowledge, operative skill, technical or craft

skill or of experience needed for the pursuit of an occupation or trade. It is

relevant to note that paragraph (a) of the definition of Educational

Establishment applies to a higher educational institute. Any institution

recognized as a BOI undertaking is not covered by paragraph (a) of that

definition. Paragraph (b) applies to any recognized institution providing

vocational training or any training for persons engaged in any trade, profession

or employment and includes an incorporated examination body. Any

institution which has entered into an agreement with the BOI is not covered by

that paragraph. Paragraph (c) applies to any institution providing funds or

other assistance by the Government and approved by the Minister in charge

of the subject of Tertiary Education and Training and thus, any institution

entered into an agreement with the BOI is not covered by that paragraph.

[65] It is paragraph (d) that applies to any institution which has entered into an

agreement with the BOI and invested a minimum of rupees 15 million in

providing vocational or practical training in specialized fields. The intention of

the Legislature is to encourage people to enter into an agreement with the

BOI, invest a minimum sum of Rs. 15 million and provides vocational or

practical training in the specified fields to be eligible for VAT exemption. The

Legislature has thus, regarded that any such institution that has entered into

an agreement with the BOI, made such investment and provided any

vocational or practical training as a separate category of Educational

Establishment to be eligible for VAT exemption. The VAT Act does not include

the words tertiary education or vocational education in section 83 of the

VAT Act and the VAT Act only refers to the words vocational or practical

training in paragraph (d) of the definition Educational Establishment. Had

30

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

the legislature intended to provide the exemption only to any institution that

has registered under the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, it could have

easily referred to the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act in paragraph (d) of

the definition Educational Establishment.

[66] The Legislature has not made any reference in the VAT Act to the Tertiary

and Vocational Education Act, and thus, the argument of the Respondent that

the absence of such specific reference is not necessary to be guided by the

requirement of registration under the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act as

a condition for the VAT exemption has no merit.

In pari materia principle-on the same matter and on the same subject

[67] I will now turn to the in pari materia principle relied on by Mr. Gunatilleke.

The principle of in pari materia means in connection with the same matter on

the same subject and thus, a subsequent legislation can be looked at to

ascertain proper interpretation to be put upon earlier Act when there is

obscurity or ambiguity (State of Bihar Versus S.K. Roy 1966 (4) TMI 72 S.C). The

principle of part material is explained in "Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes"

12th Edition at page 66 in the following manner:

"Statutes are said to be in pari materia when they deal with the same person or thing or class: it is not enough that they deal with a similar subject matter."

[68] Craies on Statute Law. 6th Edition at pages 133-34 states on the principle

of in pari materia as follows:

"Where Acts of Parliament are in pari materia that is to say, are so far related

as to form a system or code of legislature, the rule as laid down by the twelve

judges in Palmer's case. (1785-1 Leach 352) is that such Acts are to be taken

together as forming one system and as interpreting and enforcing each

other. This was on the principle that the Court should lean in favor of a

construction which sub-served and effectuated the dominant purpose of the

legislature.

[69] Bennnion on Statutory Interpretation (7th Edition, 2017) S. 21.5 at pp. 519-

520 defines the principle of in pari materia as follows:

31

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

Two or more Acts may be describes as in pari materia (from the Latin parts

or paris, meaning equal) if:

(a) They have been given a collective title;

(b) They are required to be construed as one;

(c) They have identified short titles (apart from the year); or

(d) They otherwise deal with the same subject matter on similar lines.

[70] In Raees-Uz-Zama and Another v. State Nct of Delhi, (Delhi High Court), Case No. 166/2011, decided on on 03.05.2013 followed the Bennions four part

conditions and held that the two Acts, are pari materia dealing with the single or common subject matter and are part of the same code. If the Acts are in pari materia, it is assumed that the elements of uniformity of language and meaning are intended attracting the same considerations that arise from the language canons of construction and thus, the Acts must be taken together as forming one system and enforcing each other.(Legal Maxum, In pari materia, https://bnblegal.com)

[71] Accordingly, statutues are considered to be in pari materia when they relate

to the same subject-matter and the same person or things or to the same class

of persons or things or have the same purpose or object. In the construction of

statutes, all Acts in pari materia are to be taken together as if they were one

law having one object, purpose and context. Thus, words employed in one such

Act can be used in an identical sense to be consistent and harmonise in the

construction of such other Act having one object, purpose, spirit and context.

[72] In the American case of United Society v. Eagle Bank (1829-7 Conn. 457)

Hosmer J. said:

"Statutes are in pari materia which relate to the same person or thing or to the same class of person or things. The word par must not be confounded with the word similis. It is used in opposition to it. as in the expression magis pares sunt quam similes intimating not likeness merely but identity. It is a phrase applicable to the public statutes or general laws made at different times and in reference to the same subject."

[73] In Powell v. Cleland (1948) 1 KB 262, at 273 Evershed L. J. said, It is a rule

of interpretation of statutes that it is permissible to call in aid for the

construction of words or phrases used in one Act, meanings given to them in

an earlier Act in pari materia. Evershed LJ however, refused to regard the Rent

32

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

Restriction Acts as in pari materia with the real property legislation of 1925 and

held that the Rent Restriction Act could not be regarded as pari materia with

the real property legislation. At 273, Evershed L. J. said:

In this Act of Parliament dealing with restrictions on the rights of landlords and mortgagees, expressed generally in simple and non-technical language, it had been desired to incorporate by reference the precise definition contained in the Law of Property Act, 1925, it would have been an easy result to achieve. It would have been simple - and proper - to use such a formula as we have indicated above and to provide that for the purposes of the paragraph the word "purchaser" should have the meaning assigned to it by the Law of Property Act, 1925. This was indeed the method adopted in the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1927 , in reference to the phrase "term of years absolute" (see s. 25, sub-s. 1 , of that Act). It is a rule of interpretation of statutes that it is permissible to call in aid for the construction of words or phrases used in one Act, meanings given to them in an earlier Act in pari materia (see Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes (9th ed., at p. 314). In our judgment, the Rent Restriction Acts cannot be regarded as in pari materia with the real property legislation of 1925, and counsel was unable to cite any instance where a word or phrase in one Act of Parliament - having either technical or non-technical import - was held to have the technical meaning supplied by a definition in another Act, not in pari materia with the first, without any cross-reference to the latter Act. On the other hand, the case of Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Gribble 21 , and that of Ex parte Hillman. In Re Pumfrey 22 , under s. 91 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1869 , support the view that such cross-reference will not be readily implied.

[74] However, the definition of a term in one statute cannot be used as a guide

for construction of a same term in another statute particularly in a case where

statutes have been enacted for different purposes (Hotel & Restaurant

Association v. Star India Pvt Ltd 2006 (11) TMI 540 S.C.). It is settled principle

in Excise classifications that the definition of one statute having a different

object, purpose and scheme cannot be applied mechanically to another

statute, and that the conditions or restrictions contemplated by one statute

having an object, and purpose should not be lightly and mechanically imported

and applied to a fiscal statute (Commissioner of Central Excise New Delhi v M/S.

Connaught Plaza Restaurant (P) Ltd. New Delhi 2012 (12) TMI 149-SC). Thus, it

is not a sound principle of construction to interpret an expression used in one

Act with reference to its use in another Act since the meaning of words and

expressions used in an Act must take their colour from the context in which

33

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

they appear (Eagles Chicory (Firm) v. Collector of C. Ex. & Cus. Madurai 1986 (7(

TMI 358 -CEGAT New Delhi).

[75] Now the question is whether VAT Act and the Tertiary and Vocational

Education Act are in pari materia and the two Acts form part of one system

having object, purpose and context as forming one system and enforcing each

other. I will now turn to the object, purpose and scheme of the two Acts. The

VAT Act deals with taxation and it is a consumption tax on goods and services

that is levied at each stage of the supply chain where value is added, from

initial production to the point of sale (Value-Added Tax (VAT)

(investopedia.com).

[76] The VAT Act is an Act for the imposition and collection of a VAT on goods

and services supplied in Sri Lanka or imported into Sri Lanka. VAT is charged

and collected by a taxable person (who is registered for VAT under the VAT

Act) on every supply of goods or services made in the course of any taxable

activity in Sri Lanka, and on the importation of goods into Sri Lanka. Only a

person registered for VAT can charge and collect VAT. (Balaratnam, Value

Added Tax in Sri Lanka, 2nd Ed. P. 9). The tax is borne by the final or the

ultimate consumer of Goods or services, and it is an indirect tax and the

Government will receive at the end, through all the intermediary suppliers in

the chain of production and distribution, an amount equal to the amount paid

by the final consumer (see- www.ird/gov.lk ).

[77] On the other hand, the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, No. 20 of

1990 deals with the registration of educational services, the establishment of

a tertiary and vocational education commission and provision for the plans for

the development of tertiary education and vocational education. Under the

VAT Act, only person registered for VAT can charge and collect VAT and VAT

shall be charged at the time of supply on every supply of goods or services

made in a taxable period by a registered person in the course of the carrying

on or carrying out of a taxable activity by such person in Sri Lanka.

[78] The VAT exemption is available to any institution that entered into an

agreement with the BOI and invested a sum of Rs. 1.5 million providing

vocational or practical training in the field of information technology. On the

other hand, Under the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, the registration

is required for establishing, managing, running or controlling any institute or

34

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

conducting any tertiary and vocational education course or any examination

for conferring, granting and tertiary education award.

[79] The two statutes have been enacted for different purposes and they are

not cognate legislations dealing with cognate subject. In the absence of any

definition in the VAT Act itself dealing with any cognate subject, or unless the

two statutes are dealing with any cognate subject, the words in the VAT Act

must be given the same meaning which it receives in ordinary parlance or

understood in the sense in which people conversant with the subject matter of

the statute understand it (see- P/M/ Bakshi on Interpretation of Statutes, First

Edition, Reprint 2011, p. 498). It is thus, hazardous to interpret a word in

accordance with its definition in another or statutory instrument and more so

when such statute or statutory instrument is not dealing with any cognate

subject (MSCO Pvt. Ltd. (M/s) v. Union of India, AIR 1985 SC 76 at p. 78).

[80] Craies on Statute Law, Sixth Edn., p. 164 further clarifies this thus:

In construing a word in an Act causion is necessary in adopting the meaning ascribed to the word in other Acts, it would be a new tenor in the construction of Acts of Parliament if we were required to limit a word to an unnatural sense because in some Act which is not incorporated or referred to such an interpretation is given to it for the purpose of that Act alone.

[81] The definition of the word "vocational education in the Tertiary and

Vocational Education Act, ought not to be imported into the VAT Act, which

excludes vocational education from its definition of Educational

Establishment in paragraph (d) of section 83 of the VAT Act. The VAT

exemption in paragraph (d) of section 83 of the VAT Act applies either to

vocational training or practical training in the areas of information

technology. There is no requirement that the Appellant provides both

vocational and practical training together to fall within the definition of

Educational Establishement under paragraph (d) of section 83 of the VAT.

The argument of the Respondent that the term practical training should not

be considered in isolation but in conjunction with the vocational training in

the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, and thus, the practical training

should be read together as vocational training or practical training has no

substance. In my view, where the Appellants courses in the areas of

information technology encompass practical training in the areas of

information technology, the Appellant would qualify for the VAT exemption

35

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

under the definition of an Educational Establishment under paragraph (d) of

section 83 of the VAT Act.

[82] In my view, the definitions of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act

having a different object, purpose and scheme including its registration

requirement cannot, in these circumstances, be imported into the VAT Act.

The conditions or restrictions contemplated by the Tertiary and Vocational

Education Act having different objects, and purposes should not be lightly and

mechanically imported and applied to a VAT Act and therefore, they are not in

pari materia with the same matter on the same subject. Accordingly, the

Tertiary and Vocational Education Act cannot be used to guide and ascertain

the proper interpretation to be put to the words vocational training or

practical training in the field of information technology when the purpose and

object of the two Acts are completely different from each other.

[83] Accordingly, these two Acts enacted with different objects, purposes and

scheme cannot be taken together as forming one system and as interpreting

and enforcing each other. I hold that it is not permissible to read the provisions

of the two Acts together when the same are not complementary to each other

and the purpose, object and scheme are different and thus, no common

terminology can be used so as to interpret and enforce the other Act as

suggested by the Respondent. For those reasons, I hold that the two Acts

cannot be considered to be in pari materia and therefore, the provisions of the

Tertiary and Vocational Education Act cannot throw any light on the

interpretation of the words vocational or practical training in the definition

of Educational Establishment in paragraph (d) of section 83 of the VAT Act.

For those reasons, I hold that the principle of in pari materia will not apply to

the present case.

Letter issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue

[84] Let me now turn to the letter issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Inland

Revenue dated 07.07.2006. The said Letter dated 07.07.2006 of the Deputy

Commissioner states that the Appellant s operations were exempt from VAT.

It reads:

36

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

The Director, Asia Pacific Institute of Information Technology Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, No. 388, Union Place, Colombo 02.

VAT EXEMPTION APPLICABLE TO EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ASIA PACIFIC INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY LANKA (PVT) LTD

I refer to the submissions made by Mr. Denzil A. Rodrigo, Chartered Accountant as your Authorized Represetative dated 17th June 2006.

According to the Section 18 of the VAT Amendment Act. No. 08 of 2004.

If the following conditions are satisfied, the supply of education service by an educational establishment will be exempt from VAT.

i. Establishment should have entered into an agreement with the BOI under Section 17 of Law No. 04 of 1978; ii. Annually should train not less than 300 persons; iii. Initial investment should not be less than Rs. 15 million.

Since the company has fulfilled the above conditions, supply of the said education services is only exempt from Value Added Tax, but any other taxable activity will be liable to VAT.

Thanking You, Yours faithfully,

R.K.H. Kaluarachchi Deputy Commissioner General

[85] The TAC has disregarded the written confirmation received by the

Appellant from the Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue in charge of the

subject of indirect taxes and Information Technology. The TAC in rejecting this

letter (A10) states at p. 13 of the determination:

It is to be noted that the said ruling has been issued to the Appellant, purely based on the facts given in the letter sent to the Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue by a Chartered Accountant and thus, it is not a ruling issued after examining all the material relating to the exemption provided under the VAT Act. Besides this letter written by the Chartered Accountant on behalf of the Appellant makes no mention of the legislation passed by the parliament, namely the Tertiary and Vocational

37

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

Education Act, No. 20 of 1990 and the Gazette Extraordinary No. 887/8 of 07.09.1995

[86] Even if it is assumed that the Deputy Commissioners letter is not a formal

ruling issued during the course of any appeal process, the decision of the

Deputy Commissioner that the Appellant s operations were exempt from VAT

is supported by the material submitted before the TAC by the Appellant (A1-

A2).

[87] The TAC further holds that since the Appellant claimed exemption from

VAT from 01.01.2006 onwards, there should be a reduction of the fees charged

from the students with effect from that date but there had been no such

reduction in the fees charged. The Assessor has, however, not rejected the

returns on the ground that the Appellant having claimed VAT exemption failed

to reduce the fees of the students during the relevant periods. The Appellants

position is that (i) based on the Deputy Commissioners letter, (ii) there has

been an increase in student fees from 2005 to 2010 as demonstrated from the

schedule produced by the respondent; (ii) The Appellant adjusted the VAT

component of student fees which it had previously paid; (iii) the Appellant did

not collect the increased fees from 2005-2010 in view of the ruling made by

the Deputy Commissioner. The Respondent did not dispute the Appellants

position that the fees were increased from 2005-2010 but the Appellant did

not collect the monies from the students during the relevant period on account

of the Deputy Commssioners communication.

[88] The assessor further stated that the Appellant has violated the BOI

Agreement by entering into agreements with four companies and the

Education Ministry. No material has been placed by the Respondent that the

BOI had taken any action in respect of the purported violations of the BOI

Agreement, or that the BOI Agreement lapsed due to such violations. Under

such circumstances, I see no reason for the TAC to disallow the exemption for

the purposed violation of the BOI Agreement when the BOI itself did not take

any action and cancel the BOI Agreement and the Appellant has clearly

established that it provided practical training in the areas of information

technology at all level of its courses conducted by the School of Computing as

set out in the documents marked A1-A2.

[89] I hold that the TAC erred in holding that (i) the registration by the

Appellant under the provisions of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act is

38

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

a mandatory requirement; and (ii) the failure to register the Appellant under

the said Act disentitled the Appellant for the VAT exemption under the VAT

Act. I hold that the Appellant has established that it was an Educational

Establishment referred to in paragraph (d) of the definition of Educational

Establishment in section 83 of the VAT Act and thus, the Appellant is eligible

for the exemption under the VAT Act.

Conclusion & Opinion of Court

favour of the Appellant as follows:

1. Yes

2. Yes

3. The maxim specialia generalibus derogant has no application. The TAC

of the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act, No. 20 of 1990.

4. Yes

5. Yes

6. (a) Yes

39

CA / TAX / 0005 / 2014 TAC/VAT/007/2012

15.The Appellant is an Educational Establishment providing practical

training in the areas of information technology.

16. Yes

17. The Appellant is entitled to the exemption granted by the Value Added Tax

Act for the reason that the definition of Educational Establishment in the

VAT Act requires the presence of vocational training or practical training in

the areas of information technology, and the Appellant has provided

practical training in the areas of information technology as required by the

definition of Educational Establishment in section 83 of the VAT Act.

18. Yes, not liable to pay VAT.

19. Yes.

[91] For those reasons, I annul the determination made by the Tax Appeals

Commission dated 23.01.2014. The Registrar is directed to send a certified copy

of this judgment to the Tax Appeals Commission.
