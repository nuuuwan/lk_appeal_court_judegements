    "text": "In this Act of Parliament dealing with restrictions on the rights of landlords and mortgagees, expressed generally in simple and non-technical language, it had been desired to incorporate by reference the precise definition contained in the Law of Property Act, 1925, it would have been an easy result to achieve. It would have been simple - and proper - to use such a formula as we have indicated above and to provide that for the purposes of the paragraph the word \"purchaser\" should have the meaning assigned to it by the Law of Property Act, 1925. This was indeed the method adopted in the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1927 , in reference to the phrase \"term of years absolute\" (see s. 25, sub-s. 1 , of that Act). It is a rule of interpretation of statutes that it is permissible to call in aid for the construction of words or phrases used in one Act, meanings given to them in an earlier Act in pari materia (see Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes (9th ed., at p. 314). In our judgment, the Rent Restriction Acts cannot be regarded as in pari materia with the real property legislation of 1925, and counsel was unable to cite any instance where a word or phrase in one Act of Parliament - having either technical or non-technical import - was held to have the technical meaning supplied by a definition in another Act, not in pari materia with the first, without any cross-reference to the latter Act. On the other hand, the case of Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Gribble 21 , and that of Ex parte Hillman. In Re Pumfrey 22 , under s. 91 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1869 , support the view that such cross-reference will not be readily implied.",
