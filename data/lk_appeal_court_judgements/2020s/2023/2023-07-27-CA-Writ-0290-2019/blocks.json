This notice authorizes the acquiring officer to investigate the suitability of any land. After such investigation, when the Minister considers that a particular land is suitable for the public purpose, the acquiring officer should cause a notice to be given to the owners of that land and also exhibit such notice in some conspicuous place on or near the land calling for objections, if any. If there were no objections after the time allowed for tendering objections or if there are objections, the Minister having considered the objections shall decide whether the land should or should not be acquired. Thereafter, the Minister has to make a written declaration under Section 5 (1) of the Act that the land is needed for a public purpose and will be acquired. The declaration should be published in the Gazette and also in some conspicuous places on or near the land15. After publishing the declaration in the Gazette, if there is no plan of the land made by the Government Survey Department or if the plan is not suitable, the acquiring officer should cause a survey and a plan made by the Government Survey Department. Thereafter, the acquiring officer has to publish a further notice under Section 7 of the Act, in all three languages in the Gazette, Newspapers and also cause that notice exhibited near the land or in some conspicuous places, stating the intention to acquire the land and requiring the claims for compensation to be made to the acquiring officer.",

Furthermore, whether Lot. B in plan P 10 constitutes part of the Petitioners land could be ascertained only by",
