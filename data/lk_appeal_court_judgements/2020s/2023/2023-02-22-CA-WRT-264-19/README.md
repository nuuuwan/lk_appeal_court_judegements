MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioners in this Application in the form of Public Interest Litigation,

are seeking, inter alia, orders in the nature of writs of Certiorari quashing the

Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) Report No, 403 dated 22.10.2014

and purported approvals granted by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents dated

03.12.2014 and 24.01.2018 marked P10(a) and P10(b) permitting the

development of the Hanthana Residencies Housing Project. They have also

prayed for mandates in the nature of Writs of Mandamus on a direction to

conduct a fully comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), a

direction on the 1st and 1(a) Respondents to act in compliance with the

National Environmental Act No. 47 of 1980 as amended and a direction on

the 2nd and 2(a) Respondents to declare that the said land is located within

an environmentally sensitive area and as a conservation area under the

provisions of the National Environmental Act No. 47 of1980 (as amended).

In addition, the Petitioners have also sought directions in terms of Article 140,

to the 1st to 4th Respondents and any one or more of them to restore the

environment located in and around Hanthana Residencies Housing Project

site situated in Kandy to its original state and to prosecute those responsible

for omitting to perform their statutory duty.

The Petitioners have in the first instance sought an Interim Order preventing

the 1st Respondent and/or the 6th Respondent or their agents, servants and

contractors from engaging in, permitting or facilitating development and/or

Page 5

construction of the Hanthana Residencies Housing Project until the hearing

and final determination of this Application.

This matter is now considered on whether the Petitioners are entitled to the

issue of notices and grant of the aforesaid interim reliefs prayed for, by this

Court.

The subject matter of this action is the construction and development of

Hanthana Residencies Housing Project; a residential housing project, which

is being carried out by the 1st Respondent and the 6th Respondent. The 1st

Respondent had obtained the approval of the Cabinet by Cabinet

Memorandum Number 13/0092/517/002 dated17.01.2013. Thereafter, the

1st Respondent as the project proponent has prepared the Initial

Environmental Examination Report (IEE) No. 403 dated 22nd October 2014

(marked P8). By letter dated 03.12.2014 (CEA/CPO/KY/HP/15/2012) the

2nd Respondent being the Project Approving Agency had granted approval for

the said project based on the aforesaid IEE Report (letters dated 03.12.2014

and 24.01.2018 marked "P10(a) and P10(b)").

The primary question before Court is whether the land on which the

construction and development of Hanthana Residencies Housing Project is

being carried out on is an Environmental Protected Area, Forest and/or Forest

reserve. However, I see no appropriate and sufficient documentation before

Court to identify the said land as an Environmental Protected Area, Forest

and/or Forest reserve.

Page 6

The said land is identified as an agricultural land, named 'Hanthana Estate'

and has been vested with the 1st Respondent by virtue of the Gazette No.

456/4 dated 01.06.1987 (marked P4, R5). The agricultural land has been

distinctly depicted in the survey Plan No. 2155 and Plan No. 2129 and the

said Gazette. The fact that the said land is an agricultural land is not

identified as an issue for consideration by this Court. Further, in paragraph

46 of the Petition, the Petitioners themselves state that the proposed project

is not situated in a protected area but is only bordered or surrounded by

Environmental Protected Areas declared as such i.e. the Hanthana Forest

Reserve and Dunumadalawa Forest Reserve within the municipal limits of

Kandy. In addition, various reports and letters (marked 2R3, 2R4(a),

2R4(b), R9(a), R10(a), R12(a)) clearly establish that the said land has

already been developed with various structures that have been established

within the area for use by the community therein.

Attention of Court is drawn to Public Interest Law Foundation vs. Central

Environmental Authority & Another1:

"The Court is ill equipped to form an opinion on environmental matters -

being best left to people who have specialised knowledge and skills in

such spheres. Even if a matter may seem to be preeminently one of public

law, the Courts may decline to exercise review because it is felt that

the matter is not justiciable, i.e. not suitable to judicial determination.

1 2001 (3) Sri LR 330

Page 7

In view of the above, this Court observes that while the administrative acts

have been carried out in terms of the law, at this juncture; necessity does not

arise for this Court to inquire and analyze the technical intricacies of the

matter. However, at the outset, there is no specific material to establish that

the land is within a protected area or that it can be considered a forest/forest

reserve.

Further, the Petitioners have sought a direction on the 2nd Respondent to

declare the project site as a 'conservation area' under the provisions of

National Environmental Act. However, this Court observes that it cannot

conclude on such finding without sufficient material. Notwithstanding the

aforesaid, it is also noted that the power to declare an area as a conservation

area under the National Environmental Act is vested with the Minister in

terms of Section 24C (1) of the said Act. As only the Minister is authorized to

make such declarations, the rightful authority has not been made a party to

this action.

Having perused all pleadings, written submissions and documents produced

before Court, I am of the view that the Petitioners are guilty of severe laches

in instituting this action to invoke the Writ jurisdiction of this Court. This

action has been instituted on 19.06.2019 with no justifiable explanation for

the delay. In particular, the Initial Environmental Assessment (IEE) No. 403

dated 22.10.2014 (marked P8) sought to be quashed by prayer (c) to the

petition, has been made available to the Petitioners on 22.06.2016 wherein

Page 8

the Court observes a delay of approximately 3 years. Environmental approvals

sought to be quashed by prayer (d) to the petition, are dated 03.12.2014 and

24.01.2018 (marked P10(a) and P10(b)) respectively wherein the Court

observes a delay of over 4 years and 1 year respectively. The Petitioners have

invoked the jurisdiction of this Court only several years later despite being

well aware of the project and activities being carried since inception.

In Biso Menike v. Cyril de Alwis2, Sharvananda J held that:

The proposition that the application for writ must be sought as soon as

injury is caused is merely an application of the equitable doctrine that

delay defeats equity and the longer the injured person sleeps over his

rights without any reasonable excuse the chance of his success in writ

application dwindles and the Court may reject a writ application on the

ground of unexplained delay.

In Sarath Hulangamuwa v. Siriwardena, Principal, Visaks Vidyalaaya.

Colombo 5 and others3:

"It must be mentioned that a person cannot sleep over his rights but must

seek his legal remedy with expedition-particularly where he seeks a writ

which is an extraordinary remedy granted under exceptional

circumstances"

2 1982 (1) Sri LR 368

3 1986 (1) Sri LR 275

Page 9

In Seneviratne v. Tissa Bandaranayake and another4, Amerasinghe J.

adverting to the question of long delay, commented that:

"If a person were negligent for a long and unreasonable time, the law

refuses afterwards to lend him any assistance to enforce his rights; the

law both to punish his neglect, namleges vigilantibus,non dormientibus,

subveniunt, and for other reasons refuses to assist those who sleep over

their rights and are not vigilant."

In Issadeen v. the Commissioner of National Housing and others5,

Amerasinghe J held that:

although there is no statutory provision in this country restricting the

time limit in filling an application for judicial review and the case law of

this country is indicative of the inclination of the Court to be generous in

finding a good and valid reason for allowing late applications, I am of the

view that there should be proper justification given and explained in the

delay in filling such belated application.

In Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and others V. Dayanthi Dias

Kaluarachchi6, Murdu N.B. Fernando J observed as follows:

4 1999 (2) Sri LR 341

5 2003 (2) SLR 10 at page 15

6 SC/Appeal 43/2013 minutes dated 19.06.2019

Page 10

Thus, on the face of the record four years had lapsed prior to the

respondents seeking the discretionary remedy of a writ and no good and

valid reasons have been given by the respondents in the petition filed in

the Court of Appeal pertaining to same. In the written submission filed

before this Court the respondents make an attempt to give reasons for its

delay but such belated reasons given before this Court cannot be

considered as good and valid reasons to justify delay in seeking a review

of an administrative decision. Reasons should have been given when the

application was filed in the Court of Appeal and not now. Thus, there is

merit in the argument of the appellant, that the respondents were guilty

of delay and the writ application filed before the Court of Appeal should

have been dismissed in limine.

In this context, I observe that the Petitioners have been negligent in not

addressing the Court in a timely manner and that they have slept over their

rights, if any, without any reasonable excuse whatsoever. Therefore, as

identified above, the Petitioners prayer for grant of Writs by prayers (c) and

(d) being substantial relief sought in their Petition, cannot be granted due to

severe laches. This Court also observes that the rest of the relief sought by

the Petitioners are consequential to the said relief thereto and thus will not

be entitled to such.

As such, I hold that the decisions challenged by the Petitioners are in line

with established principles of law. The Respondents have not acted ultra vires

Page 11

or in an arbitrary, capricious, or illegal manner. In this respect, I hold that

the impugned reports and decisions are not liable to be quashed and that the

Petitioners are not entitled for Writs of Certiorari or Mandamus and/or a

direction in terms of Article 140.

For the above reasons, I refuse to issue notice and grant the interim relief

prayed for. I dismiss the Application of the Petitioners and make no Order as

to the costs of this Application.

Application dismissed.
