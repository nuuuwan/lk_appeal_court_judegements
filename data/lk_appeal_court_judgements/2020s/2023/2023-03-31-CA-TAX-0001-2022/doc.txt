Introduction

[1] This is an Appeal by way of a case stated against the determination of the

Tax Appeals Commission dated 11.11.2021 confirming the determination of the

Respondent dated 16.01.2017 and dismissing the Appeal of the Appellant. The

period relates to the year of assessment 2011/2012.

Factual Background

[2] The Appellant Mr. S.P. Muttiah is the precedent partner of A. Valentine

Trading Co. which is registered as a partnership and the nature of the business

is a property development and letting premises for commercial purpose. The

Appellant submitted his returns for the said year of assessment claiming a

concessionary rate of 10% provided under and in terms of Item 31 of the Fifth

Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 as amended (hereinafter

referred to as the Inland Revenue Act). The Appellant further claimed interest

expenses under section 32(5)(a) of the Inland Revenue Act. The Deputy

Commissioner by letter dated 28.11.2014 refused to accept the same and issued

assessment for the following reasons:

1. The concessionary tax rate of 10% provided under Item 31 of the Fifth

Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act is applicable for any undertaking

carried on in Sri Lanka for operation and maintenance of facilities for

storage. As per the lease agreements, the Appellant has rented out

buildings for longer periods on agreements and the Appellants source of

income is purely rental income and not business income;

2. As per the lease agreements, the Appellant is not an undertaking carried

on in Sri Lanka for the operation and maintenance of facilities for storage,

and therefore, the Appellant is not entitled to apply for the concessionary

3

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

tax rate of 10% provided under item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland

Revenue Act;

3. As per section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act, letting of premises by a

company has been defined as a business, but letting or leasing by an

individual is not defined as a business, and as the rental income is within

the meaning of source rents, deductions are permitted only in respect of

rates and repair allowance;

4. The Appellant is not entitled to deduct the interest paid under section

32(5) of the Inland Revenue Act due to the absence of documents annexed

with the return in proof of such interest payment made under section 32(5)

of the Inland Revenue Act.

[3] The Appellant appealed to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

(hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) against the said assessment, and

the Respondent by its determination dated 16.01.2017 revised the said

assessment by allowing the interest paid on the loan taken for the construction

of the building in terms of section 32 (5) of the Inland Revenue Act. Accordingly,

the Respondent reduced the assessment issued for the year of assessment

2001/2012 and the tax liability was determined as follows:

2011/12 Rs. 937,030 Rs. 468,515 Rs. 1,445,545

Appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission & the Court of Appeal

[4] Being dissatisfied with the said determination of the Respondent, the

Appellant appealed to the Tax Appeals Commission and the main questions

that were considered by the TAX Appeals Commission were:

1. Whether Deputy Commissioner had failed to give reasons for not

accepting the returns of the Appellant in terms of section 163(3) of the

Inland Revenue Act;

2. Whether the Appellant was an undertaking carried on in Sri Lanka for

operation and maintenance of facilities for storage to be entitled to

secure 10% concession under item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland

Revenue Act;

4

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

3. In the event, the Appellant failed to secure 10% concession under item

31 of the Fifth Schedule, whether the Appellant is still entitled to the 10%

concession under section 59B of the Inland Revenue Act.

[5] The Tax Appeals Commission, in its determination dated 11.11.2021 stated

that the concessionary rate of tax set out in Item 31 does not apply to the

Appellant for the following reasons:

1. The term undertaking means a kind of a business, and the term

business has been defined in Section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act,

which restricts the letting or leasing of any premises by a company and

not by an individual;

2. Even though the Appellant has rented out his premises to several

companies for storage purposes, the Appellant was not involved in the

business of operating and maintaining facilities for storage, and

therefore, the Appellant cannot rely on the concessionary tax benefit

under item 31of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act;

3. The activity carried out by the Appellant was only renting out his

premises to others to be used for storage purposes, which falls under

Section 3 (g) of the Inland Revenue Act, and thus, the Appellants activity

of renting out the premises cannot be treated as an undertaking or as a

business;

4. The Appellants activity of renting out his premises should be calculated

in terms of Section 6 of the Inland Revenue Act, and thus, the Appellant

is not entitled to secure the concessionary tax rate provided in Item 31

of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act.

5. The term undertaking in section 59B of the Inland Revenue Act cannot

be applied to treat the activity of the Appellant as a business, and

therefore, the Appellant is not an undertaking within the meaning of

section 59B of the Inland Revenue Act. The Appellant is therefore, not

entitled to secure the concessionary tax rate of 10% under section 59B

of the Inland Revenue Act.

[6] The Tax Appeals Commission (hereinafter referred to as the TAC) by its

determination dated 11.11.2021 confirmed the determination of the

Respondent and dismissed the appeal subject to the qualification that if the

5

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

Respondent is satisfied with the documents submitted, it should allow the

interest expenses claimed on the loan taken for refurbishment of warehouses.

[7] Being dissatisfied with the said determination of the Tax Appeals

Commission, the Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal and formulated the

following Questions of Law in the Case Stated for the opinion of the Court of

Appeal.

1. Is the assessment, and the determination of the Commissioner General,

and the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission pursuant to same)

liable to be quashed and/or annulled inasmuch as the assessor failed to

duly provide reasons for the assessment as required by section 163(3) of

the Inland revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended)?

2. Is the Appellant entitled to the benefit of the concessionary tax rate of

10% provided under and in terms of item 31 of the 5th Schedule to the

Inland revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended) in view of the fact that

the undertaking provided storage facilities as set out in the said item 31?

3. In any event, is the Appellant entitled to the concessionary tax rate of

10% as provided in section 59B of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of

2006, as amended, in view of the fact that the turnover of the

undertaking was less than rupees three hundred million in the relevant

year of assessment?

4. Is the Appellant entitled to claim interest paid in respect of overdrafts as

permissible deductions in terms of section 25 of the Inland Revenue Act,

No. 10 of 2006 (as amended) or in the alternative, as a deduction under

and in terms of section 32(5) of the Inland revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006

(as amended)?

5. Is the assessment, (and the determination of the Commissioner General

and the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission, thereon)

excessive and contrary to law?

6. In view of the evidence and material before the Tax Appeals Commission,

did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law in arriving at the conclusion

set out in its determination?

6

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

[8] At the hearing of the Appeal, we heard, Mr. Suren Fernando, the learned

Counsel for the Appellant and Mr. Manohara Jayasinghe, the learned Deputy

Solicitor General for the Respondent. At the commencement of the hearing, Mr.

Suren Fernando intimated to Court that he did not wish to pursue the questions

of law No. 1 and 4 (Vide- the journal entry dated 23.11.2022). Accordingly, Mr.

Suren Fernando confined his submissions mainly on the questions of law No. 2

and 3.

[9] At the hearing, Mr. Suren Fernando submitted that the TAC erred in relying

on the erroneous ruling made by the Committee for Interpretation of Tax Laws

dated 29.05.2015 that ruled that the term business has been defined in

Section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act, referring to an activity carried out only

by a company. Mr. Suren Fernando further submitted that the concept of

undertaking in item 31 is wider than the concept of business, referred to in

Section 217, which encompasses a number of different activities including the

rental income received by the Appellant from warehouses. He submitted that

item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Act applies to both individuals and

companies. He referred to the Sinhala version of item 31 of the Inland Revenue

Act and submitted that it refers to both profits and income of an undertaking

and that it makes reference to an individual and thus, the concessionary rate

in item 31 applies to both business profits and income of such an undertaking

who is either an individual or company. He submitted that the concessionary

tax rate referred to in item 31 applies to an individual who is engaged in renting

warehouses, and thus, the income received by the Appellant from renting

warehouses qualifies for the preferential rate of tax, independent of whether

rents received by such individual constitute business income or rental income.

[10] The learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that the rent and income

from rent is treated differently in the Inland Revenue Act and in terms of the

definition of the term business in Section 217, the letting or renting out a

warehouse becomes a business when it is done by a company. He submitted

that accordingly, the business income of an individual cannot be treated as

business income for the purpose of granting concession under item 31 of the

Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act.

[11] In view of the rival submissions made by both Counsel, this Court is invited

to determine the following four issues:

7

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

1. Whether the concessionary tax rate of 10% under and in terms of item

31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act applies only to the business income of a company in view of the definition of the term business in Section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act;

2. Even if item 31 of the Fifth Schedule applies to an individual, whether the

Appellant constitutes an undertaking carried on the business of operating and maintaining facilities for storage within the meaning of item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act;

3. On the facts and circumstances of this case, whether the income received

by the Appellant from leasing out her property is to be treated as business income or rental income from her property;

4. On the facts and circumstances of this case, whether the Appellant is

entitled to a concessionary tax rate under item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act.

Analysis

Question of Law No. 2

Whether the Appellant is entitled to the benefit of a 10% concessionary tax rate under and in terms of item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006

[12] Let me now consider the first argument of Mr. Suren Fernando that the

Appellant is entitled to the concession in terms of item 31 of the Fifth Schedule

regardless of whether it operates and maintains the storage facilities itself since

the Appellant is an undertaking within the meaning of item 31 of the Fifth

Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act. This Court is thus called upon to consider

the meaning of the expression undertaking specified in item 31 of the Fifth

Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act, and then decide whether the Appellant as

an undertaking carried on in Sri Lanka for operation and maintenance of

facilities for storage.

[13] Before proceeding to deal with the issues involved in the second and third

Questions of Law, I shall refer to the relevant provisions of the Inland Revenue

Act, No. 10 of 2006. Item 31 of the Fifth Schedule makes provisions for the

concessionary rate of income tax applicable to any undertaking carried on in Sri

8

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

Lanka for operation and maintenance of facilities for storage, development of

software or supply of labour. Item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland

Revenue Act reads as follows:

31. The rate of income tax applicable to any undertaking carried on in Sri Lanka for operation and maintenance of

facilities for storage, development of software or supply of labour. As per the First Schedule, but subject to a maximum of 10 per centum for an individual, and 10 per centum for a company.

[14] One has to consider the object of granting tax concessions to an

undertaking under item 31 and thus, the said expression undertaking will have

to be construed liberally in a broader commercial sense, keeping its object and

context in mind. In the process of construing the object and context of item 31,

we have to consider whether the concession afforded to an undertaking is

confined to a company, and if it applies to an individual, whether the nature of

the business activity of such individual qualifies for the tax concession under

item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act.

Meaning of the expression undertaking

[15] The term undertaking used in item 31 of the Inland Revenue Act has not

been defined in the said Act. The expression undertaking has, however,

different shades of meaning and is the most elastic and broad in nature.

Undertaking in common parlance means an "enterprise", business,

"venture" or "engagement" etc. According to Online Dictionary, Merriam

Webster, undertaking means, anything undertaken, any business, work, or

project which one engages in, or attempts, an enterprise or venture or

engagement in the context in which it occurs.

[16] The Kerala High Court had occasion to expound this term undertaking

and industrial undertaking in the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961 in the case of

P. Alikunju M.A. Nazeer Cashew Industries v. CIT, 166 ITR 804. The High Court

stated in paragraphs 5 and 6:

9

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

5. What then is an "industrial undertaking"? The Income-tax Act does not define what is "an undertaking" or what is an "industrial undertaking". It has, therefore, become necessary to construe these words. Words used in a statute dealing with matters relating to the general public are presumed to have been used in their popular rather than their narrow, legal or technical sense. Loquitur ut vulgus, that is, according to the common understanding and acceptance of the terms, is the doctrine that should be applied in construing the words used in statutes dealing with matters relating to the public in general. In short, if an "Act is directed to dealings with matters affecting everybody generally, the words used have the meaning attached to them in the common and ordinary use of language." (Vide- Unwin v. Hanson [1891] 2 QB 115, per Lord Esher M. R. at page 119).

[17] Lord Easter in Unwin v. Hanson (supra) has further explained the manner in

which the words used in statutes dealing with matters relating to the public in

general, are construed at page 119 as follows:

If the Act, is one passed with reference to a particular trade, business, or

transaction, and words are used which everybody conversant with that trade, business, or transaction, knows and understands to have a particular meaning in it, then the words are to be construed as having that particular meaning, though it may differ from the common or ordinary meaning of the words.

[18] In Secretary, Madras Gymkhana Club Employees' Union v. Management of

the Gymkhana Club (1968 SCR (1) 742), the Indian Supreme Court held that

though undertaking is a word of large import, it means anything undertaken

or any project or enterprise, in the context in which it occurs, it must be read as

meaning an undertaking analogous to trade or business or as part of trade or

business or as an undertaking analogous to trade or business (Para 37).

[19] The ECJ in Klaus Hofner and Fritz Elser v. Macrotron GmbH, Case C-41/90

decided on 23.04.1991, sought to maximize the application of competition law

by taking a broad definition of undertaking. The traditional definition in Klaus

Hofner and Fritz Elser v. Macrotron GmbH (supra) at paragraph 21 was that the

concept of undertaking encompasses every entity engaged in an economic

activity, regardless of the legal status of the entity and the way in which it is

financed and secondly, that employment procurement is an economic activity.

At paragraph 24, it was observed that an entity such as a public employment

agency engaged in the business of employment may be classified as an

undertaking for the purpose of applying the Community Competition rules.

10

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

[20] In Polychrome Electrical Industries (Pvt) Ltd v. Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue (CA/Tax/49/2019 decided on 26.03.2021), this Court held that

(i) the undertaking can be broadly described as any entity in a business or trade

activity taken as a whole, but does not include individual assets or liability or

any combination thereof not constituting a business activity; (ii) the term

business can thus be understood as having a broad meaning and the scope

of the term extends to a trade, profession, vocation, or any such arrangement

having the characteristics of a business transaction. It held at paragraph 67 as

follows:

67. The Courts general approach to whether a given entity is an undertaking within the meaning of the tax rules focuses on the types of composite business or trade activities engaged in by such entity as a whole from which profits and income arise rather than individual business or trading activity or the characteristics of the actors who perform it. Thus, the concept of undertaking refers to the collective reference to a number of business or trading activities as a whole, undertaken by an economically independent and self-sustaining one indivisible business entity rather than a single business activity under one undertaking.

Is an individual entitled to a concessionary rate of tax referred to in item

31 of the Inland Revenue Act?

[21] The TAC in its findings held that:

1. an undertaking means a kind of a business, and the term business has

been defined in Section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act, which restricts

the letting or leasing of any premises to a company and not an individual;

2. the activity carried out by the Appellant is clearly renting of premises,

which falls under Section 3 (g) of the Inland Revenue Act;

3. the activity carried out by the Appellant is clearly renting of premises,

which will fall under Section 3 (g) and not under section 3(a) of the Inland

Revenue Act; and

4. the Appellants activity of renting of premises cannot be treated as an

undertaking or as a business.

[22] The relevant finding of the TAC at p. 9 of the determination reads as follows:

11

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

The term undertaking means a kind of business and the term business is defined in section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act as follows: - business includes an agricultural undertaking, the racing of horses, the letting or leasing of any premises, including any land by a company and forestry. The definition cannot be overlooked. Therefore, it is seen that letting or leasing of a premises is treated as a business only, if such activities are carried out by a company. In any other circumstances, profit and income from letting premises by any person other than a company is treated as income from renting of properties falling under section 3(g) of the Inland Revenue Act. It has been argued that the term undertaking cannot be restricted to a business and that even facilities for storage would come within the meaning of an undertaking. However, it is seen that the Appellant is only renting out commercial premises. Therefore, the term undertaking referred to in section 58B cannot be applied to treat the activity of the Appellant as a business, in view of the definition of business given in section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act.

[23] I now desire to consider the question whether the concessionary rate of tax

referred to in item 31 applies only to a company and thus, an undertaking can

only be applied to an activity carried out by a company and not an activity

carried out by an individual. Construing this word business, the Indian

Supreme Court in Narain Swadeshi Weaving Mills v. Commissioner of Excess

Profits Tax [1954] 26 ITR 765 (SC) observed that the word business connotes

some real, substantial and systematic or organised course of activity or conduct

with a set purpose. Endorsing this construction, the Supreme Court of India in

a later decision in Mazagaon Dock Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax (1958) 34

ITR 368 observed at page 376: The word business is, as has often been said,

one of wide import and in fiscal statutes, it must be construed in a broader

rather than a restricted sense.

[24] Superficially, the word business has been narrowly defined in Section 217

of the Inland Revenue Act of 2006. It reads as follows:

Business includes an agricultural undertaking, the racing of horses, the letting or leasing of any premises, including any land by a company and the forestry.

[25] The definition of business in Section 217 is, however, inclusive and not

exhaustive in nature, and thus, it includes an agricultural undertaking, the racing

of horses, the letting or leasing of any premises, including any land by a

company and the forestry. In Mr. S. P. Muttiah v. The Commissioner General of

12

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

Inland Revenue CA/TAX/46/2019 decided on 30.07.2021, this Court held at

paragraph 122:

As noted, the concept of undertaking is wider than the mere term business referred to in Section 217. It encompasses every entity engaged in an economic activity, and it must be defined in fiscal statutes broadly. It, thus, extends to any business or trading activity of any person, several persons (associated persons), natural or legal and separate activities within the entity (Polychrome Electrical Industries (Pvt) Ltd v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue(supra).It is immaterial whether the undertaking that carries out such business or trading activity is performed by any company or individual, or several persons, natural or legal persons within such entity, so long as such individual or company also fulfils the conditions set out in Item 31 of the Inland Revenue Act.

[26] The First Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act sets out the rates of income

tax applicable to individuals other than any receivers, trustees, executers or

liquidators, and the Second Schedule sets out the rates of income tax applicable

to companies. The Fifth Schedule sets out the rates of income tax applicable,

notwithstanding the rates specified in the First, Second and Third Schedules.

The Second Column of item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Act refers both to a

company and individual as follows:

As per the First Schedule, but subject to a minimum of 10 per centum for

an individual and 10 per centum for a company.

[27] The Sinhala version of Item No. 31 also reads as follows

m<uqjk Wmf,aLkh m%ldrj" tfy;a mqoa.,fhl= inkaOfhka ishhg 10 Wmrsuhlg iy iud.ula inkaOfhka ishhg 10'''

[28] If the intention of the legislature was to limit the tax concession to a

company as the Respondent argued, the reference to an individual in the

Second Column of item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act is

meaningless. The Sinhala version of item 31 makes reference to an individual

and thus, the Respondent could not offer any explanation as to why the Second

Column refers to an individual if the intention of the legislature was to limit

the concession to a company. Further, Section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act,

No. 10 of 2006 as amended, defines the term person as follows:

Person includes a company or body of persons or any government.

13

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

[29] On the other hand, the Sinhala version of item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to

the Inland Revenue Act, as amended, refers to both profits and income of the

undertaking and thus, item 31 captures both profits and income. The Sinhala

version reads as follows:

.nvd lsrSf" uDoqldx. ixjOkh lsrSf fyda llrejka iemhSf myiql ls%hd;aul lsrSu iy mj;ajdf.k hEu i|yd YS% ,xldf os mj;ajdf.k hkq ,nk h wdh;khla ,dn iy wdodhug wod<j wdodh no qwkqm%udKh'''

[30] The word undertaking therefore, should be understood to have been

used in item 31 in a wide sense, and must be understood as one taking in its

fold all collective business or trading activities, a person or company may

undertake as one economically independent and self-sustaining indivisible

entity subject to the purpose and activity referred to in Item 31 of the Fifth

Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act (Mr. S. P. Muttiah v. The Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue (supra) & Mrs. C.S.D.B. Mutunayagam

(CA/TAX/48/2019, decided on 30.07.2021, paragraph 28).

[31] In my view, the concept of undertaking referred to in item 31 is wider

than the mere term business referred to in Section 217 of the Inland Revenue

Act. It is not limited to the activities carried out by a company as incorrectly

found by the Tax Appeals Commission. It applies both to an individual and a

company and profits and income earned by an individual or company as one

economically independent and self-sustaining indivisible entity, as long as

such individual or company in the nature of an undertaking carried on business

or trading activities as a whole, from which profits and income arise for the

purpose and activity referred to in Item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to the

Inland Revenue Act (Mr. S. P. Muttiah v. The Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (supra, p. 129) & Mrs. C.S.D.B. Mutunayagam (CA/TAX/48/2019,

decided on 30.07.2021, paragraph 29). Hence, that part of the finding of the TAC,

namely that the term business referred to in section 217 of the Inland Revenue

Act is limited to activities of a company shall stand corrected.

Business income vs. Rental income

[32] The next question is whether the rental income received by the Appellant

can be considered as a business income for the purpose of item 31 of the Inland

Revenue Act, irrespective of the fact that the concession in item 31 applies to

an individual or a company, and profits or income of an undertaking. The TAC

however, did not rest its decision on the ground that the Appellant as an

14

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

individual could not be regarded as an undertaking. The TAC proceeded to

consider the next crucial question whether the Appellant is involved in the

activity of operating and maintaining facilities for storage. Having considered

the second question, the TAC held on the facts, that (i) the Appellant is not

engaged in operating and maintaining facilities for storage as required by item

31; and (ii) the income received by the Appellant by leasing out his premises for

storage constitutes a rental income under Section 3 (g) and not a business

income under section 3(a) of the Inland Revenue Act. For the said reasons, the

TAC disallowed the tax concession sought by the Appellant under item 31 of

the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act.

[33] Now the question is whether the Appellant as one economically

independent and self-sustaining indivisible entity carried on in Sri Lanka for

operation and maintenance of facilities for storage. The last page of the

determination made by the TAC at page 10 of the determination confirms this

position. It reads:

In this case, we have carefully considered the oral and written submissions of both the representatives for the Appellant and the Respondent. In view of the material stated above, it is clear that the Appellant is not involved in an undertaking or an activity of operating and maintaining facilities for storage. Therefore, the Appellant is not entitled to claim the 10% tax concession provided in the Fifth Schedule item 31 or under section 59B of the Inland Revenue Act.

[34] Mr. Suren Fernando submitted that the phraseology for operation and

maintenance of facilities for storage in item 31 is different from operating

and maintaining storage facility, but the phraseology should only be

interpreted to apply to income derived from renting out of storage facilities. Mr.

Fernando relied on the Sinhala version of the Inland Revenue Act and submitted

that the intention of the legislature makes it clear that any undertaking that

provides facilities for the purpose of the operation and maintenance of storage

facilities is entitled to secure the concession under item 31. Hence, he argued

that upon a reading of the Sinhala version of item 31, a wide interpretation

should be given to item 31 of the Fifth Schedule so as to include rental income

as well.

[35] The Sinhala version is reproduced herewith for clarity. It reads:

15

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

.nvdlsrSf" uDoqldx. ixjOkh lsrSf fyda llrejka iemhSf myiql ls%hd;aul lsrSu iy mj;ajdf.k hEu i|yd YS% ,xldf os mj;ajdf.k hkq ,nk h wdh;khla ,dn iy wdodhug wod<j wdodh noq wkqm%udKh'''

[36] In view of Mr. Fernandos submission that the tax concession is triggered

where any undertaking that provides facilities for the purpose of operation and

maintenance of storage facilities, and therefore, there is no further requirement

for the undertaking itself to operates and maintains the storage facility, it is

necessary to consider the difference between operation and operating.

According to Compact Oxford Thesaurus Dictionary (Indian Edition), 2001, as a

noun, the word operation is:

1. The action of operating 2. An act of surgery performed 3. An organized

action involving a number of people 4. A business organization 5. Math,

a process in which a number of quantity, etc., is altered according to set

formal rules.

2. control, direction, function, functioning, management, operating,

performance, running, working, 2. Action, activity, business, campaign,

effort, enterprise, exercise, manoeuvre, movement, procedure,

proceeding, process, project, transaction, undertaking, venture; 3.

Biopsy, surgery, transplant.

[37] According to Compact Oxford Thesaurus Dictionary (Indian Edition), 2001,

as a verb, the word operate (operates, operating, operated) is:

1. function 2 control the functioning of (a machine) or the activities of (an

organization) 3. (of an armed force) carry out military activities 4. Be in

effect: a powerful law operates in politics. 5. Perform a surgical operation.

2. act, function, go, perform, run, work, 2. Control, deal with, drive, manage,

use, work. 3. Do an operation, perform surgery.

[38] Thus, the word operation is the noun and the word operating is the

verb. The word operate in relation to a storage facility is the function of a

storage facility or control the functioning of a storage facility operation. The

word operation in relation to a storage facility of an undertaking is the method

by which such storage facility performs its function or activities it performs or

action of operating such storage facility or running such facility.

[39] Similarly, the word maintenance of the noun and the word maintain is

the verb. According to Compact Oxford Thesaurus Dictionary (Indian Edition),

the word maintain is 1. Cause for continuance in the same state or at the same

level. 2. Keep in good condition by checking or repairing it regularly. 3. support

financially. 4. State strongly to be the case.

[40] The word maintenance is 1. The action of maintaining something. 2. The

provision of financial support, conservation, looking after, repairs, servicing,

upkeeping. Thus, maintenance inter alia, is the process of keeping things

working and maintain inter alia, is to keep something working.

[41] P. M. Bakshi on Interpretation of Statutes First Edition, 2011 dealing with

the construction of the meaning of words states at p. 496:

The general rule of statutory construction of a fiscal statute is that words have to be construed strictly according to their ordinary and natural meaning, particularly when the statute is a fiscal one irrespective of the object with which the provisions was introduced. Of course, if there is ambiguity in the statutory language, reference may be made to the legislative intent to resolve the ambiguity. But if the statutory language is unambiguous, then that must be given effect to. The Legislature is deemed to intend and mean what it says. The need for interpretation arises only when the words used in the statute are, on their own terms ambivalent and do not manifest the intention of the Legislature. However, there are exceptions to this rule. The first is that the rule of strict construction does not apply to a provision which merely lays down the machinery for the calculation or procedure for the collection of tax. The second exception is: If two constructions are possible and a strict construction would lead to an absurd result then the construction which is keeping with the object of the statutory provision or in keeping with equity could be accepted.

[42] It is a settled principle of law that in construing the relevant item or entry

in fiscal statutes, if it is one of everyday use, the concerned authority must

normally construe it, as to how it is understood in common parlance or in the

commercial world or trade circles. This statement was amply described by Lord

Esher in Unwin v. Hanson (1891) 2 QB 115 thus:

If the Act is directed to dealing with matters affecting everybody generally, the words used have the meaning attached to them in the common and ordinary use of the language. If the Act is one passed with reference to a particular trade, business or transaction, and words are used which everybody

17

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

conversant with that trade, business or transaction knows and understands to have a particular meaning in it then the words are to be construed as having that particular meaning though it may differ from the common or ordinary meaning of the words.

[43] There is no ambiguity in the statutory language of the words operation

and operates or maintenance and maintain and the tax concession is

provided to any undertaking viz, economically independent and self-sustaining

indivisible entity that is functioning or performing activities of operating and

maintaining facilities for storage.

[44] Mr. Fernando submitted that the Appellant is in the business of operation

and maintenance of storage facilities and the income derived from renting out

of storage facilities falls within the tax concession specified in item 31 of the

Fifth Schedule. He further submitted that the TAC erred in relying on the lease

agreements between the Appellant and the two parties but the said lease

agreements are not a conclusive basis to determine that the Appellant was in

the business of renting out properties instead.

[45] The question whether the rental income falls into the category of business

income within the meaning of item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland

Revenue Act, depends on the type of the activity that is carried on by an

undertaking in Sri Lanka, and the purpose referred to in item 31 of the Act.

Whether the Appellant is operating and maintaining facilities for storage

[46] In order to earn the benefit under item 31 of the Fifth Schedule, the

following conditions must be satisfied by the Appellant, namely,

(i) the Appellant is an undertaking carried on in Sri Lanka.

(ii) the Appellant being an undertaking, must have derived profits or income from storage facilities (warehouses); and

(iii) the Appellant being an undertaking, must have carried on in Sri Lanka for operation and maintenance of facilities for (a) storage, (b) development of software; or (c) supply of labour.

[47] It is significant to note that the words "rate of income tax applicable to any

undertaking" occurring in item 31 of the Act is qualified by the words "carried

on in Sri Lanka for the operation and maintenance of facilities for storage,

development of software or supply of labour. In line with the meaning of the

18

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

expression undertaking referred to in paragraph 30 of this judgment, the

warehouses in question for the purpose of item 31, should have been rented or

let or leased out for activities, namely, the operation and maintenance of

facilities and for purposes, namely, the storage or development of software or

supply of labour in the course of business or trade of the Appellant. If the

warehouses are used for any other activity or purpose, the benefit of a

concession under item 31 of the Act would not be available to the Appellant.

[48] Applying the principles discussed earlier, the distinction between rental

income and business income must be understood in the context of the scheme,

object and principles of the concession afforded under item 31 of the Inland

Revenue Act. It is relevant to note that a business income can include income

from any business or trade activity carried out by a taxpayer for profit or with a

reasonable expectation of profit, which may include a profession, vocation,

trade, manufacturing endeavour, an undertaking of any kind, as well as a

venture or concern in the nature of trade.

Beneficial provision in a tax statute

[49] It has long been a well-established principle that strict application of taxing

statutes applies only to taxing provisions such as charging provision or

provision imposing penalties and not to those parts of a nature of a statute

which contains a machinery provision (Indian Explosives Ltd v. Kanpur Nagar

Mahapalika (1982) All LJ 11140 &Commissioner of Agricultural Income Tax:

Calcutta v. National Tag Traders AIR 1980 SC 301). A beneficial provision that

contains a concession in rates of tax is a type of incentive provided to a taxpayer

to reduce his tax liability, either by exemption, deductions and exclusions and

such concessions are provided with a view to encourage and promote activities

such as industrial, manufacturing, agricultural activities and development of

commercial activities. Where there is a beneficial provision in a tax statute, it

should be liberally construed so long as such concession does not make

violence to the plain meaning of such provision, impair the legislative

requirement and the spirit of the provision.

[50] A construction of such a provision depends, inter alia, upon the purpose

for which the concession is sought to be granted and upon the fulfilment of

such conditions as may be specified therein. It is well-settled that in order to

claim the benefit of a tax concession, a party who seeks such concession must

comply with all the conditions of a provision and the benefit is not conferred,

19

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

by stretching or adding words to the provision. In State Level Committee v.

Morgardshammar India Ltd AIR 1966 SC 524, the Indian Supreme Court held

that:

.....It must be remembered that no unit has a right to claim exemption from tax as a matter of right. His right is only insofar as it is provided.... While providing for exemption, the Legislature has hedged it with certain conditions. It is not open to the Court to ignore these conditions and extend the exemption.

[51] It will appear from the scheme used in the Inland Revenue Act that the

legislature has granted tax concessions under item 31, with a view to

encouraging an undertaking carried on business in Sri Lanka for the operation

and maintenance of facilities in respect of the three main purposes, namely,

storage, development of software or supply of labour. The legislature advisedly

used the words for operation and maintenance of facilities for storage

because the intention of the legislature in granting the concessionary tax rate

was to encourage any undertaking to carry on business for operation and

maintenance of facilities for storages or development of software or supply of

labour as a source of income for such undertaking for meeting operating and

maintaining costs of such warehouses.

[52] If it was the intention of the legislature to extend the benefit to profits and

income derived by mere letting or renting or leasing out warehouses

irrespective of whether, it was involved in operating and maintaining facilities

for storage, it would not have used the words the rate of income tax applicable

to any undertaking carried on in Sri Lanka for operation and maintenance of

facilities for storage.. It could have easily used the words The rate of

income tax applicable to any undertaking carried on in Sri Lanka for storage..

[53] The key words are for operation and maintenance of facilities for storage,

which refer to the operation and maintenance of facilities for whole storage and

not that the undertaking shall also use the storage individually by itself either

to store goods or provide services therefrom. I do not think that the words for

operation and maintenance of facilities for storage used in item 31 prevent a

taxpayer from renting or leasing out his warehouses to others and making an

income or profit. I am not impressed by the argument that it would not be

possible for the Appellant to derive a profit or income by renting out his

warehouses to others when the taxpayer is engaged in the business of

20

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

operating and maintaining facilities for storage as referred to in item 31 of the

Inland Revenue Act.

[54] All what is intended by the legislature is that the undertaking must be

engaged in the business or trading activity of operating and maintaining

facilities for storage, and item 31 does not in any way, prevent such undertaking

from deriving profits or income by letting or renting or leasing out warehouses

to others while operating and maintaining facilities for storage.

[55] If the argument advanced by Suren Fernando that the Appellant is entitled

to the exemption in terms of item 31 of the Fifth Schedule regardless of whether

it operates the storage facilities, is correct, the words used in item 31 for

operation and maintenance of facilities for storage will be meaningless.

What will happen, if the benefit is extended to mere provision of storage

without fulfilling the condition of operation and maintenance of facilities for

storage, referred to in item 31? If the words "operation and maintenance of

facilities for storage, are not given their natural meaning, it will defeat the

legislative intent and enlarge the legislative intent by disregarding a condition

precedent to the operation of the concessionary tax rate in item 31.

[56] In my view, the legislative intent was to encourage a taxpayer to carry on

the business of operating and maintaining facilities for storage as an

undertaking, and derive business income from such storage facilities in the

course of its business or trading activity while providing storage facilities to

those who are otherwise unable to afford storage facilities for themselves.

Whether the Income received from warehouses can be treated as business income

[57] The next question is to consider whether, the rental income derived by the

Appellant from warehouses can be treated as a business income in the

circumstances of the case. One should first determine whether the rents are

income from a business of the Appellant as an undertaking and if so, whether

the concession will be applicable under item 31. A distinction has to be made

between the income received by any individual from merely renting or letting

or leasing out a warehousing facility and income received by any individual in

the nature of an undertaking from operating and maintaining facilities for

storage in the course of its business or trading activity. The former may involve

the costs of constructions and other ancillary expenses while the latter involves

not only costs of construction, but also operation and maintenance costs of

21

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

storage facilities, such as cooling, lighting, water, cleaning, security,

depreciation, repair, staircase, insurance, forklift trucks and staff and personnel

costs and services.

[58] The general rule is that the income received from mere renting out of

properties is a common type of rental income and not business income unless

such income was received in the course of carrying on business of renting out

such property where the acquisition, use, management or disposition of such

property makes up an integral part of ones business operations.

Factors used in distinguishing rental income from business Income

[59] In order to determine whether, the Appellant is carrying on a business or

merely earning rental income by letting out premises, the dividing line is to

identify the nature of the activity and its dealings with the property. At this stage

it is important to consider the distinction between the rental income and the

business income from warehouse facilities provided to others by taxpayers, in

the context of Indian case law that has addressed this issue.

[60] In the case of CIT v. Calcutta National Bank Ltd. (1959 AIR 928), the Indian

Supreme Court held that the realisation of rental income by the assessee was

in the course of its business in the prosecution of one of its objects in its

memorandum and was liable to be included in its business profits and was

assessable to tax as a business profit. In the Indian Supreme Court case of

Universal Plast Ltd. Commissioner of Income Tax, decided on 23 March, 1999, it

was decided that where the assessee is engaged in the business of giving

cotton, stopped its business and let out godowns and also separated machinery

and let out pressing factory to a metal pressing factory, rental income derived

therefrom could not be assessed as business income.

[61] In East India Housing and Land Development Trust Ltd v. Commissioner of

Income Tax, West Bengal (1961) 42 ITR 49, the question arose for consideration,

whether the rental income that is received was to be treated as income from

the house property or the income from the business. The Court took the view

that the income derived by the company from shops and stalls is income

received from the property and such income shall be treated as income from

the house property and not income from a business (paragraph 3). The Court

based its decision in the context of the main objective of the company and took

the view that letting out of the property was not the object of the company at

22

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

all. The Court was of the opinion that the character of that income which was

from the house property had not altered because it was received by the

company formed with the object of developing and setting up properties. Shah,

J. stated at paragraph 6:

6. The income received by the appellant from shops is indisputable income from property; so is the income from stalls from occupants. The character of the income is not altered merely because some stalls remain occupied by some occupants and the remaining source of income from the stalls is occupation of the stalls, and it is a matter of little moment that the occupation which is the source of the income is temporary. The income-tax authorities were, in our judgment, right in holding that the income received by the appellant was assessable under section 9 of the Income Tax Act.

[62] In Karanpura Development Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, West

Bengal, 44 ITR 362 (SC), the Court took the view at paragraph 13 that the

deciding factor is not the ownership of land or leases, but the nature of the activity

of the assessee and the nature of the operations in relation to them. The objects

of the company must also be kept in view to interpret the activity [emphasis

added]. The position in law, ultimately, was summarised by M. Hidayatullah, J.in

the following words:

34. As has been already pointed out in connection with the other two cases where there is a letting out of premises and collection of rents the assessment on a property basis may be correct but not so, where the letting or sub-letting is part of a trading operation. The dividing line is difficult to find; but in the case of a company with its professed objects and the manner of its activities and the nature of its dealings with its property, it is possible to say on which side the operations fall and to what head the income is to be assigned.

35. Ownership of property and leasing it out may be done as a part of business, or it may be done as landowner. Whether it is the one or the other must necessarily depend upon the object with which the Act is done. It is not that no company can own property and enjoy it as property, whether by itself or by giving the use of it to another on rent. Where this happens, the appropriate head to apply is "income from property" (section 9), even though the company may be doing extensive business otherwise. But a company formed with the specific object of acquiring properties not with the view to leasing them as property, but to selling them or turning them to account even by way of leasing them out as an integral part of its business cannot be said to treat them as landowner but as trader.

23

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

[63] After applying the aforesaid principle to the facts, the Court found that (i)

the sub-leases were granted, because the assessee company wanted, was a

matter of business, to turn its rights to account by opening out, and developing

the areas, and then granting these sub-leases with an eye to profit; (ii) the

assessee company having secured a large tract of coal-bearing land parcel,

developed it into a kind of stock-in-trade to be profitably dealt with, extended

its business acquiring fresh fields. In the circumstances, the Court came to the

conclusion that the nature of the business was trading within the objects of the

company and not enjoyment of property as land owner and thus, that income

had to be treated as income from business and not as income from house

property.

[64] In Atm a Ram Properties (P) Ltd. v. CIT(2006) 102 TTJ Delhi 345, the Indian

Supreme Court held that rental income derived by the assessee company by

letting out a property simplicitor, was chargeable to tax under the head "income

from house property" and not as business income, irrespective of the fact that

the assessee company was doing business of acquiring, developing and selling

properties. The Court said that the rental income was received by the company

because of ownership of the property and not by exploitation of property by

way of complex commercial activity. While holding that the rental income

received by the assessee does not become income from trade or business,

Jagtap, A.M. J. held:

"25. ........, the legal position which emerges can be summarised as follows. If in the given case, the assessee is found to be the owner property and rental ITA No. 273/D/2013 & 1134/D/2013 Asstt. Years: 2006-07 & 2005-06 income is earned by him by letting out predominantly the said property, such rental income will be assessable under the head "Income from house property" and not "Profits and gains of business or profession". What is let out should be predominantly the said property inasmuch as the rental income should be from the bare letting of the tenements or from letting accompanied by incidental services or facilities.

[65] Let me now consider the nature of the activity carried on by the Appellant

and consider whether the income that is received was to be treated as income

from the renting out of property or the income from the business of operation

and maintenance of storage facilities specified in item 31 of the Fifth Schedule

to the Inland Revenue Act. The Appellant is the precedent partner of a

registered partnership A. Valentine Trading Co. and the Appellants Return of

Income describes the nature of the partnership business as letting premises for

24

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

commercial purposes (page 45n of the TAC brief). Mr. Suren Fernando

however, submitted that the ownership of the land or lease agreements are not

conclusive to prove that the Appellant is engaged in the business of renting

premises for storage facilities or engaged in the business of operation and

maintenance of storage facilities. He submitted that what matters is the nature

of the activity conducted by the Appellant.

[66] Sarkar, J. held in the Indian Supreme Court in Sultan Brothers (P) Ltd. v.

CIT (1964) 51 ITR 353 (SC)/ 1964 AIR 1389, 1964 SCR (5) 807 at paragraph 9:

"We think each case has to be looked at from a businessman's point of view to find out whether the letting was the doing of a business or the exploitation of his property by an owner. We do not further think that a thing can by its very nature be a commercial asset. A commercial asset is only an asset used in a business and nothing else, and business may be carried on with practically all things. Therefore, it is not possible to say that a particular activity is business because it is concerned with an asset with which trade is commonly carried on. We find nothing in the cases referred, to support the proposition that certain assets are commercial assets in their very nature".

[67] While the objects of the business must be kept in mind in deciding the

factors, the nature of the activity and the nature of the operations of the

taxpayer in relation to them are the vital factors in deciding whether the income

from warehouses could become a rental income or business income (Karanpura

Development Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal(44 ITR 362

(SC). The Indian judgments have thus, given a demarcation line by providing a

proposition that where the main object of the company is to acquire and hold

properties and to let out those properties, then the rental income may be

treated as income from business and not as income from house property. The

question whether an income of an individual is to be treated as income from

business or mere rental income depends upon the particular circumstances

of each case as held in Karanpura Development Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of

Income Tax, West Bengal'(supra) and Sutan Brothers (P) Ltd. v. CIT(supra).

[68] In the light of above judicial pronouncements, it is significant to consider

the facts and circumstances of the present case and examine first, whether the

nature and the activity of the Appellant was such that he was carrying on

business of operating and maintaining facilities for storage and second, if so,

whether the income derived from leasing out her warehouses could be treated

25

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

as business income of the Appellant in the course of operating and maintaining

facilities for storage.

[69] The Appellant has submitted that he had inherited 5 warehouses from his

father and constructed three more, and thereafter continued to provide storage

facilities in those warehouses to customers, in the same manner that his father

had done without any lease agreement but only a memorandum of

understanding. He has further submitted that upon the request made by the

Department of Inland Revenue, the Appellant executed lease agreements for

the premises and the Department of Inland Revenue is now using the said lease

agreements as a basis to deny the due tax concession. The Appellants

argument was that the material submitted by the Appellant demonstrates that

he in fact operates and maintains the storage facilities and therefore, the

Appellant is entitled to the exemption in terms of item 31 of the Fifth Schedule

to the Inland Revenue Act.

[70] The learned Deputy Solicitor Counsel, however, submitted that in terms of

item 31, the concessionary rate of 10% can only be granted if the Appellant is

operating and maintaining a facility for storage and the facts relied on by the

Appellant indicate that the Appellant was merely providing a storage facility to

others and collecting a rent, which are insufficient for the eligibility under item

31 of the Fifth Schedule. He further submitted that no credible evidence had

been placed by the Appellant to establish that he was operating and

maintaining facilities for storage, and therefore, the Appellant is not entitled to

10% concessionary rate of tax as correctly determined by the TAC.

[71] It is not in dispute that the Appellant has entered into lease agreements

with Cargills Retail (Private) Limited and Ranfer Teas (Private) Limited and leased

out his premises to Cargills Retail (Private) Limited (p. 184 of the TAC brief) and

Ranfer Teas (Pvt) Ltd (p. 172 of the TAC brief). The Appellant relies on the

following two clauses of the said two lease agreements with Cargills Retail

(Private) Limited and Ranfer Teas (Private) Limited, and argues that they indicate

that the Appellant was responsible for the maintenance of the premises and

that the TAC was wrong in holding that the Appellant was only renting

warehouses to the parties based only on the existence of written lease

agreements:

[72] Paragraph 4(m) of the lease agreement with Cargills Retail (Private) Limited

states:

26

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

(m). To permit the lessors and their agents, engineers, workmen and other person authorized in writing after due notice to the lessee to enter upon the demised premises at all reasonable times during the day time to view and examine the state of repair and condition thereof without causing any inconvenience or disturbance to the lessee or its customers and for the purpose of effecting any repairs to the demised premises in accordance with the prior agreement with the Lessors covenants. Such repairs to be effected with the prior agreement and arrangement of the Lessee so as to cause as little inconvenience and disruption to the smooth running of the Lessees business.

[73] Paragraph z(3) of the lease agreement with Ranfer Teas (Private) Limited

states:

z3.To permit the Lessors and their agents and their agents engineers workmen and other persons authorized by the Lessors in writing with or without workmen after three (03) days previous notice in writing at all reasonable times during the day convenient to the Lessee to enter upon the demised premises to inspect the same and to carry out any kind of repairs undertaken by the lessors in terms hereof and in so doing to cause as little inconvenience as possible to the occupants of the demised premises.

[74] The Appellants argument was that the lease agreements establish that the

Appellant effected repairs of the premised in question. A perusal of a perusal of

the following clause 2(I) of the lease agreement with Cargills Retail (Pvt) Ltd and

clause 2(f) of the lease agreement with Ranfer Teas (Pvt) Ltd however, indicate

that the day-to-day running repairs of the premises were to be carried out by

the lessees and not by the Lessors:

[75] Clause 2(I) of the lease agreement with Cargills Retail (Pvt) Ltd states

2(I). To repair or cause to be repaired at the cost and expense of the lessee all damages to the demised premises or any part thereof including damages to the structure of the demised premises which may be caused due to the negligence on the part of the lessee its servants, agents, licensees and invitees and all repairs the cost of which shall not exceed the sum of Rupees Five Thousand (Rs. 5000.00) at any one time except repairs due to structural defects and faulty construction.

[76] Clause 2(f) of the lease agreement with Ranfer Teas (Pvt) Ltd states:

2(f). To carry out the repairs excluding structural repairs to the demised premises and the fixtures and fittings therein not exceeding Rupees Ten Thousand (Rs. 10,000/) at any one time unless such structural repairs or

27

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

repairs in excess of Rupees Then Thousand (Rs. 10,000/) are necessitated by any negligent or willful act on the part of the lessee or other occupants of the demised premises.

[77] A perusal of clause 2(i) of the lease agreement with Cargills Retail (Pvt) Ltd

and clause 2(n) of the lease agreement with Ranfer Teas (Pvt) Ltd reveals that

the obligation to install firefighting equipment and maintain such equipment in

good working order at cost and expense was on the lessee and not on the

lessor. Clause 2(i) of the lease agreement with Cargills Retail (Pvt) Ltd states:

(i)To install all the cost and expense of the lessee fire fighting equipment in

the demised premises and maintain such equipment in good working order.

[78] Clause 2(n) of the lease agreement with Ranfer Teas (Pvt) Ltd states:

(n) The lessee shall at its cost install in the demised premises and maintain in good working order adequate firefighting equipment and appliances to the satisfaction of the Fire Brigade Department, Ja-Ela Pradeshiya Sabha Ministry of defence or any other Authority specifically by law during the currency of this lease.

[79] A perusal of clause 2(n) of the lease agreement with Cargills Retail (Pvt) Ltd

and clause 2(g) of the lease agreement with Ranfer Teas (Pvt) Ltd reveals that

the obligation to remove garbage accumulated in the demised premises and

keep the storage premises in a clean and sanitary state and order was the

responsibility of the lessee and not the lessor. Clause 2(n) of the lease

agreement with Cargills Retail (Pvt) Ltd states:

(n) To be responsible for the timely removal of the garbage accumulated in the demised premises and not to place garbage bins on Lot 1D depicted in the said Plan No. 6328 (reservation for road).

[80] Clause 2(g) of the lease agreement with Ranfer Teas (Pvt) Ltd states:

(g) To keep the demised premises in a clean and sanitary state order and condition and in strict accordance with the laws by laws of the Ja-ela Pradeeshiya Sabha, Western Province Provincial Council, the Urban Development Authority or any other State Authority and to keep the lessors freed from and indemnified against from all prosecutions and fines which may be instituted or imposed in consequence of the breach or non-performance of any laws or by-laws respecting housing sanitation and conservancy.

[81] A perusal of clause 2(p) of the lease agreement with Cargills Retail (Pvt) Ltd

and clause 2(z) of the lease agreement with Ranfer Teas (Pvt) Ltd reveals that

the obligation to provide security to the demised premises continuously day

28

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

and night, during the term of the lease is on the lessee and not on the lessor.

Clause 2(p) of the lease agreement with Cargills Retail (Pvt) Ltd states:

(p) To provide security to the demised premises continuously day and night

during the said term.

[82] Clause 2(z) of the lease agreement with Ranfer Teas (Pvt) Ltd:

(z). To employ or engage day and night separate security services for the

safety of the contents of the demised premises.

[83] A perusal of clause 2(h) of the lease agreement with Cargills Retail (Pvt) Ltd

and clause 2(p) of the lease agreement with Ranfer Teas (Pvt) Ltd reveals that

the obligation to insure the goods and equipment in the demised premises

against loss or damage by terrorism, fire, flood, lightning, cyclone storm or

explosions and riot commotion of war was on the lessee and not on the lessor.

Clause 2(h) of the lease agreement with Cargills Retail (Pvt) Ltd states:

(h) To insure and keep insured the lessees goods and equipment in the demised premises against loss or damage by terrorism fire flood lightning cyclone storm, tempest explosions, riots, civil commotion, war, labour disturbances and any malicious damages and/or any risk whatsoever and submit to the lessor copies of the said insurance so effected.

[84] Clause 2(p) of the lease agreement with Ranfer Teas (Pvt) Ltd:

(P) To insure and keep insured lessees goods and equipment in the demised premises against loss or damage by terrorism, fire, flood, lighting, cyclone, storm, tempest explosions, riots, commotion, war.

[85] A perusal of clause 5(i) of the lease agreement with Cargills Retail (Pvt) Ltd

reveals that the obligation to install a generator, air conditioning units, chillers

and water motors at the premises was the obligation of the lessee and not the

lessor:

5(i) To install at the cost and expense of the lessee firefighting equipment in the demised premises and maintain such equipment in good working order.

[86] A perusal of clause 3(g) of the lease agreement with Cargills Retail (Pvt) Ltd

reveals that the obligation to obtain a three-phase electricity connection of 100

amps to the demised premises with a separate meter for the exclusive use of

the lessee was the responsibility of the lessee and not the lessor:

29

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

3(g). To permit the lessee to obtain of the cost install a generator, air conditioning units, chillers and water motors at the premises was the obligation of the lessee and not the lessor.

[87] The Appellant further submitted the following documents exchanged

between the Appellant and the lessees/occupiers establish that the Appellant

was involved in the business of operation and maintenance of storage facilities:

1. (a) Letter from the Appellant to Cargills (Ceylon) Limited relating to

invoicing for the year 2011 (p. 189 of the TAC brief);

(b)Letters from the Appellant to George Steuarts (Teas and Marketing)

(PVT) Limited relating to invoicing for the years 2010-2012 (p. 186-187);

(c) A letter from George Steuart Teas to the Appellant relating to the

Maintenance of warehouses (p. 185);

(d) Lease agreement between the Appellant and Cargills retail (Private)

Limited (p.184);

(e) Lease agreement between the Appellant and Ranfer Teas (Private)

Limited (p.172).

2. The Appellants letters to A. Valentine Trading Co. and George Steuart

Teas demonstrate that the Appellant operated and maintained the

warehouses and therefore, the actual relationship between the parties is

established by the content of the said letters and not by the standard

clauses of the lease agreement;

[88] The letters sent to Cargills (Pvt) Ltd by the Appellant (p. 189 of the TAC

brief) and the letter sent to George Steuarts (Teas and Marketing) (Pvt) Ltd (p.

186 & 187 of the TAC brief) only refers to the change in the rental amount and

the need to enter into a formal lease agreement. Those two letters do not

establish whatsoever, that the Appellant was involved in the business of

operation and maintenance of storage facilities. The letter from George Steuart

Teas to the Appellant relates to a request to make the following repairs in

connection with another warehouse (54/2A, 54/2B in Mattakkuliya) to the roof,

floor and colour washing and supply of electricity before George Steuart Teas

occupied the said warehouse. No agreement or lease agreement or any

document has been produced by the Appellant to substantiate the position that

the Appellant was involved in the operation and maintenance of the

warehouse No. 54/2A, 54/2B situated in Mattakkuliya.

30

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

[89] The letter sent to George Steuarts (Teas and Marketing) (Pvt) Ltd also

relates to the increase in rental for the premises at No. 54/1B & 54/2, Centre

Road, Colombo 15 and the need to enter into a lease agreement (p. 188 of the

TAC brief). The Appellant however, relies on the following statements of the

said letter and argues that they establish that the Appellant was involved in the

business of operation and maintenance of storage facilities.

Due to the rise in the cost of maintenance of the buildings and roadways

and the increase in the Assessment Taxes by the CMC of 26%, we are

compelled to increase the rentals. As you are also aware that Sri Lankas

inflation was over 25% IN 2008 and that cost of construction materials and

labour has risen above 30% to 40% in the past few years, we are compelled

to make these increases.

As always, we will maintain the warehouses to be in good condition so that

you can carry out your business of Tea Exporting without any interruptions

and delays.

[90] Apart from the mere statement of the Appellant that we will maintain the

warehouses to be in good condition so that you can carry out your business of

Tea Exporting without any interruption and delays, no supporting document

or lease agreement has been produced by the Appellant to substantiate the

position that the Appellant was involved in the operation and maintenance of

the warehouse No. 54/1B, 54/2. situated in Mattakkuliya.

[91] From the details furnished in the brief, it appeared that apart from

constructing buildings to be used as warehouse facilities and leasing them out

to several companies subject to common terms and conditions set out in those

lease agreements, no credible material has been placed by the Appellant to

show that he has installed plant and machinery such as central air-conditioning,

overhead cranes, material handling facilities, fire-fighting equipment and fire

appliances and provided specific services in the premises leased out to his

lessees (Cargills Retail (Pvt) Ltd and Ranfer Teas (Pvt) Ltd) or George Steuarts

(Teas and Marketing) (Pvt) Ltd during the year 2011/2012.

[92] A perusal of lease agreements contained in the brief reveals that apart from

basic ancillary services such as water and electricity provided to lessees, there

had been no central air conditioning provided to each store and the users are

responsible for the installation of their own air conditioners in respective

31

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

premises, and other electrical appliances, firefighting equipment, fire appliances

to their respective premises and maintaining and servicing of such equipment.

Further, the employment of day and night security services for the safety of their

own goods at their premises and insuring their own goods on the premises in

question are the sole responsibilities of the lessees (Vide- lease agreements of

the brief).

Affidavit of the Appellant

[93] At the hearing, Mr. Suren Fernando strenuously argued that as the

Appellant produced an Affidavit marked as Annexure 01 to the final written

submissions (p. 111 of the brief) before the TAC, the burden was on the

Respondent to disprove it or establish facts to dispute the contents of the

affidavit. He submitted that the Respondent did not object to the admissibility

of the Affidavit at any stage either in the proceedings before the TAC or in its

written submissions or sought to cross examine the Appellant on the Affidavit

or lead evidence to contradict same. He submitted that the TAC by not rejecting

the Affidavit produced by the Appellant before it, allowed, by implication, the

Appellant to adduce evidence through the Affidavit in terms of section 9(8) of

the TAX Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 (TAC Act) without any

objection and therefore, the admissibility of the Affidavit cannot be raised at

this stage of the appeal by the Respondent after the Affidavit became part of

the record.

[94] The contention of Mr. Fernando was that the Appellant had placed

uncontradicted Affidavit evidence as to the nature of the business and

discharged his burden of proof whereas the Respondent failed to contradict the

Appellant through cross examination or leading of evidence to dispute same.

On the other hand, Mr. Jayasinghe submitted that the TAC was correct in not

relying on the Affidavit of the Appellant produced with his written submissions

without the consent of the TAC as required by section 9(8) of the TAC Act. He

further submitted that the TAC acted correctly in relying on the contents of the

lease agreements to the exclusion of the Appellants Affidavit, based on the

parol evidence rule found in section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance, to determine

that the Appellant did not engage in the operation and maintenance of facilities

for storage that he was involved in the operation and maintenance of the

warehouses

[95] A perusal of the TAC brief reveals that the Appellant annexed an Affidavit

(Annexure 1) to his written submissions dated 07.01.2020 (pp. 111 & 100 and

32

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

97-99 of the TAC brief). The Appellant relies on paragraphs 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,

13, 14, 15 and 16 and 17 of the Affidavit to establish that the Appellant was

engaged in operating and maintaining storage facilities and provides other

ancillary facilities to his lessees. A perusal of the TAC brief reveals that the

Appellant annexed the Affidavit in question to his written submissions before

the TAC without obtaining the TACs consent or permission, in contravention of

the provision of section 9(8) of the TAC Act. Section 9(8) of the TAC Act, as

amended by the TAC (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013 provides:

Except with the consent of the Commission and on such terms as the Commission may determine, the appellant shall not at the hearing, be allowed to produce any document which was not produced before the Commission-General or the Director-General, as the case may be, or to adduce the evidence of any witness whose evidence was not led before the Commissioner-General or the Director-General as the case may be, or adduce evidence of a witness whose evidence has already been recorded at the hearing before the Commissioner-General or the Director-General, as the case may be.

[96] The TAC brief does not indicate that any request had been made by the

Appellant to the TAC seeking permission to produce the Affidavit in question,

or an order was made by the TAC permitting the Appellant to produce the

Affidavit before the TAC. Under such circumstances, the TAC cannot be faulted

in not making any reference to the said Affidavit or relying on the averments

contained in the Affidavit produced by the Appellant without its consent.

[97] The Appellant is relying on the following main facts in the Affidavit to

establish that his partner was engaged in operating and maintaining storage

facilities and in order provide storage facilities to the customers, the partnership

took the following steps:

1. The partnership recruited and employed the staff including a Manager,

Supervisor, skilled labour in carpentry, steel fabrication and repairs, welding

and gas cutting, construction machine operators, masons and other

labourers;

2. The partnership acquired necessary property, plant and equipment

including crew, cab vehicles, mini lorries, vans, construction equipment to

repair and maintain the facilities so that the goods of the customers could

be stored without any damage or hindrance;

33

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

3. The partnership employed as a security officer who was entrusted with the

security of the premises;

4. The partnership attends to any situation that arises due to natural and man-

made emergencies;

5. When there is a storm or heavy rains with high winds causing damages to

the roofing sheets or the roof structure, the partnership dispatches a team

to attend and repair the same within a few hours so that there is no water

damage to the building;

6. When a container or lorry that came to load or unload the goods has

damaged the warehouse gate or wall or roadway and cannot close the

warehouse large doors or making a big hole in the roadway, the partnership

dispatches an emergency repair team/a crew consisting of workers of the

partnership and at times, specialized skilled workers to repair the damage

or repair the roadway;

7. When there is a damage to a water pipeline or electrical connection due to

an accident, the partnership works with the Water Board and Electricity

Board in rectifying and repairing the problem;

8. The Partnership upgrades and renovates the storage facilities enabling the

customers to obtain the approvals from the authorities;

9. The partnership provides electricity and water facilities and pays the bills to

the CEB and the Water Board;

10. Warehouse and Storage premises are insured by the partnership and the

taxes are paid to the authorities.

(Vide-paragraphs 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 and 17 of the

Affidavit).

[98] The Appellants Affidavit does not contain any documentary proof to

substantiate the averments contained in the aforesaid paragraphs and, in

particular there is no proof whatsoever to the effect that:

1. The Appellant recruited and employed the staff including a Manager,

Supervisor, skilled labour in carpentry, steel fabrication and repairs,

welding and gas cutting, construction machine operators, masons and

other labourers;

2. The Appellant acquired necessary property, plant and equipment

including crew, cab vehicles, mini lorries, vans, construction equipment

to repair and maintain the facilities so that the goods of the customers

could be stored without any damage or hindrance;

34

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

3. The Appellant employed a security officer who was entrusted with the

security of the premises or employed any skilled workers to attend to

any situation that arises due to natural and man-made emergencies;

4. The Appellant employed or recruited a skilled team or emergency or

specialized skilled workers to attend and repair works of the premises

within a few hours;

5. The entire warehouse and individual storage premises are insured by the

Appellant contrary to the contents of the lease agreement that provides

that the lessee must insure its own goods and equipment in the

premises;

6. The Appellant installed a generator to the entire storage facilities and

provided security to the entire storage facilities when the lease

agreements provide that the lessees must install their own generators

and their own security continuously day and night;

[99] As noted, there is no credible evidence placed by the Appellant to establish

that the Appellant operated and maintained the warehouse facilities by

providing central air conditioning to each premises, firefighting equipment,

central generator facility, day and night security services, garbage collection by

employing a Manager/Supervisor/skilled workers/ society personnel, technical

and mechanical staff.

[100] A warehouse operation may cover several important operations such as

developing warehouse infrastructure, operating services and customer safety

measures etc. A storage maintenance may also include the upkeeping and

repairing services provided in storage facilities such as storage hardware,

replacement of storage components, engineering and technical resources and

services either through directly without third party or through third party

maintenance contracts. Had these facilities been provided, the Appellant would

have employed a considerable workforce, both skilled and semi-skilled staff to

whom salaries are to be paid regularly. No material has been placed by the

Appellant that he carried on an organised activity with a view to commercially

exploiting the infrastructure developed at a substantial cost, so that it could be

treated as an undertaking engaged in operating and maintaining facilities for

storage as specified in Item 31. No proof has been placed by the Appellant to

come to such a conclusion as clearly observed by the Tax Appeals Commission.

[101] Accordingly, in the absence of such credible and supporting documentary

proof, the TAC was correct in relying on the contents of the lease agreements

35

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

to determine that the Appellant did not engage in the operation and

maintenance of facilities for storage except to provide ancillary services to the

warehouses such as water and electricity,

[102] In Griffiths v. Jackson (supra), Vinelott J. quoted with approval the

following dictum of Lord Greene MR in Croft (Inspector of Taxes) v. Sywell

Airdrome Ltd (1942) 1 K.B. 317 at 329 when drawing the distinction between

income derived from the exploitation of property rights and income derived

from the carrying on of a trade:

why and on what principle is a person who, for example, sets up a refreshment stall on his land and provides services for people admitted to his land, not exhaustively taxed under Schedule A or B (as the case may be) in respect of or occupation save in the sense and to the limited extent that he must own or occupy the land before he can erect and carry on the refreshment stall or perform the services. The profits earned in such a case are referable, not to the exercise of the rights of property or of occupation since the customers come on to the land for the purpose of obtaining refreshment or procuring the benefit of the services. If on the other hand, the owner of land having (let me suppose) a remarkable view or some historic monument merely allows the public to come on to the land in return for an admission fee, I cannot myself see why it should be said that his profits are not covered by the Schedule A assessment since all that he is doing is to exploit his right of property by grating licences to come upon the land. The fact that he keeps the paths in order or the monument in repair in order to make a visit more attractive to the public again appears to me to make no difference, any more than does the action of the landlord of a house in keeping it in repair.

[103] Having considered the relevant authorities, Vinelott J. concluded as follows:

When the income derived by the owner from letting furnished, whether for a short or a long term and whether in small or large units and whether in self-contained units or to tenants who share a bathroom or kitchen or the like, is not income derived from carrying on a trade but is still taxable under Sch. A or, in the case of para. 4, under Case VI of Sch. D. Of course, if the owner provides services and the services are separately charged or the receipts can be otherwise apportioned in part to the provision of the services any profit derived from the provision of the services will be taxable as the profits of a trade.

36

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

[104} The Appellant has not placed any credible material to satisfy that the

nature of the leasing out his premises is an integral part of the business or

trading operation of the Appellant who is engaged in operating and

maintaining facilities for storage and not enjoyment of property as the land

owner by merely leasing out her premises to others and providing ancillary

services. The mere fact that the Appellant has leased out her premises to her

lessees and derived a rental income from warehouses cannot, for that sole

reason be treated, as carrying on a trade or business as an undertaking referred

to in Item 31.

[105] The facts and the circumstances clearly indicate that it is a case of a leasing

out the property owned by the Appellant and deriving rental income from the

subject premises implicitor as indicated in the lease agreements. It is not a case

of exploitation of the property predominantly for carrying on a trade or

business by an undertaking and deriving income from carrying on a trade or

business for the operation and maintenance of facilities for storage. For those

reasons, I am of the view that the Appellant has failed to establish that that the

Appellant is an undertaking, viz, one economically independent and self-

sustaining indivisible entity engaged in the operation and maintenance of

facilities for storage as required by item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland

Revenue Act.

[106] As such, considering all the facts and circumstances of the case, and

keeping in view the legal position emanating from various judicial

pronouncements discussed hereinabove, I hold that the income received by the

Appellant from leasing out his warehouses in the year under consideration

cannot be treated as a business income but only as a rental income as correctly

determined by the TAC. For those reasons, the income received by the

Appellant from leasing out his properties would fall under Section 3(g) of the

Inland Revenue Act as rental income, and therefore, the Appellant is not entitled

to the tax concession under item 31 of the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue

Act as correctly determined by the TAC.

Question of Law No. 3

Is the Appellant entitled to the concessionary tax rate of 10% under and in terms of Section 59B of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006, as amended?

37

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

[107] The contention of Mr. Suren Fernando was that in any event, the Appellant

was entitled to the concessionary tax rate of 10% as provided in section 59B of

the Inland Revenue Act, in view of the fact that the turnover of the undertaking

was less than rupees three hundred million in the relevant year and assessment.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General however, submitted that the mere letting

out of a building or premises to be used as a storage facility as opposed to

trade/business income under section 3(a) cannot amount to the provision of a

service by an undertaking as contemplated by section 59B of the Act. He

submitted, therefore, that the Appellant is disentitled from obtaining the

concession in terms of section 59B (1) and (2) of the Inland Revenue Act.

[108] Section 59B (1) and (2) of the Inland Revenue Act reads as follows:

(1) The profits and income of any person (not being the holding company, a subsidiary company, or as associate company of a group of companies) for any year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2011, from any understanding referred to in subsection (2), shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other provisions of this Act, but subject to provisions of section 59B, be chargeable with income tax at the appropriate rate specified in the Fifth Schedule to this Act.

(2) For the purpose of this section, undertaking in relation to any year of assessment means any undertaking-

(a) engaged in the manufacture of any article or in the provision of any

service; and

(b) the turnover of such undertaking (other than from the sale of any capital

asset) for that year of assessment-

(i) being any year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2001 but prior to April, 2013, does not exceed three hundred million rupees;

(ii) being any year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2013, does not exceed five hundred million rupees.

[109] For the eligibility for tax concession under Section 59B, the following two

limbs in Section 59B (2) must be satisfied:

(c) Any undertaking must be engaged in the manufacture of any article

or in the provision of any service; and

38

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

(d) the turnover of such undertaking (other than from the sale of any

capital asset) for that year of assessment commencing on or after April,

1, 2001 but prior to April, 2013, does not exceed Rs. 300/- Million.

[110] The words "any undertaking engaged in the manufacture of any article or

in the provision of any service in section 59B (2) unmistakably demonstrate

that the undertaking for the purpose of tax concession under section 59B must

be one, which partakes of the character of a business or trade in relation to

manufacture of any article or provision of any service. On a plain reading, it

transpires that under section 59B (2), an assessee becomes entitled to 10% tax

concession of the profits and income where the undertaking is engaged in

the business of manufacture of any article or in the provision of service and

the total turnover of such undertaking does not exceed Rs. 300 million (prior

to April 1, 2013).

[111] The concession specified in Section 59B in relation to any undertaking

engaged in the manufacture of any article or in the provision of any service has

to be understood in the context in which the term undertaking is to be

understood (Polycrome Electrical Industries (Pvt) Ltd v. Commissioner-General of

Inland Revenue) (supra). The term undertaking has to be understood as an

economically independent and self-sustaining entity taken as a whole and in the

context in which it occurs. Thus, it must be understood first, as any undertaking

as a whole and then, such undertaking must be engaged in the manufacture of

any article or provision of services (supra).

[112] This Court held in Polycrome Electrical Industries (Pvt) Ltd v. Commissioner-

General of Inland Revenue (supra) that one has to consider the object of granting

tax concessions to an undertaking under Section 59B and thus, the said

expression undertaking will have to be construed liberally in a broader

commercial or business/trade sense, keeping its object and context in mind.

[113] The question is, in addition to providing ancillary services referred to in the

lease agreements, whether the Appellant is engaged in providing services as an

integral part of his business or trading activity in the nature of an undertaking

referred to in Section 59B to be regarded as a separate service income, rather

than mere activity of renting out her premises to tenants for storage. The

ancillary services provided by the Appellant as referred to in the lease

agreements are directly connected to his rental income, which cannot be

interpreted as services provided by the Appellant as an undertaking in the course

39

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

of her business or trading activity to be treated as a separate service income

within the meaning of Section 59B of the Inland Revenue Act.

[114] In Coman v. Governors of the Rotunda Hospital, [1921] 1 A.C.1, the House

of Lords drew a clear distinction between a landowner who leases or lets his land

to tenants and derives a profit from the rents from lessees and the landowner

who utilises his land while retaining possession of it by hiring it out to be used

by persons who do not take any estate or interest in the land itself. In

the Rotunda case, concert and ball rooms were hired out to persons desirous of

utilising them for the purposes of music or dancing entertainments and the

owners had equipped the rooms so as to make them available for those

purposes.

[115] The Court held that the services which the owners had rendered could not

be regarded as mere incidents attached to the letting of the rooms themselves,

but an adventure or concern in the nature of trade. Lord Atkinson, at page 35,

said, I do not think the services thus rendered can be regarded as "mere

incidents attached to the letting of the rooms themselves. What is let, paid for

and used is the room plus the services as "constituting one composite whole, for

which money is paid, and "is obtained from the general public. In my opinion

this letting "is an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.

[116] As noted, there is nothing to indicate in the lease agreements in specific

terms that the Appellant is providing separate services, in addition to ancillary

services provided to his tenants to be regarded as a separate service income.

The mere fact that the Appellant is providing storage facilities with ancillary

services to his lessees and collecting a profit therefrom cannot be treated as a

profit of any undertaking engaged in the provision of service in the nature of

business or trade within the meaning of Section 59B of the Act.

[117] Having regard to the totality of the circumstances and to the true

substance of the agreements, I hold that the Appellant is not an undertaking

within the meaning of section 59B of the Inland Revenue Act. Therefore, I hold

that the Appellant is not entitled to the concessionary rate of 10% under and in

terms of Section 59B of the Inland Revenue Act.

Questions of Law No. 5 and 6

40

CA /TAX/0001/2022 TAC/IT/050/2017

5-Is the assessment (and the determination of the Commissioner-General and the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission, thereon) excessive and contrary to law?

6-In view of the evidence and material before the Tax Appeals Commission, did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law in arriving at the conclusion set out in its determination?

[118] No separate submission was made on behalf of the Appellant at the

hearing that the assessment (and the determination of the Commissioner-

General and the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission, thereon) was

excessive and contrary to law other than the submissions made on behalf of the

Appellant relating to the questions of law No. 2 and 3. I further hold that subject

to our observations in paragraph 31 of this judgment, the TAC did not err in law

in arriving at the conclusion set out in its determination dated 11.11.2021.

Conclusion & Opinion of Court

[119] In these circumstances, I answer Questions of Law against the Appellant

and in favour of the Respondent as follows:

1. Does not arise as the Appellant did not pursue the question of law No. 1

at the hearing.

2. No.

3. No

4. Does not arise as the Appellant did not pursue the question of law No. 4

at the hearing.

5. No.

6. No. [120] For those reasons stated in this judgment and subject to our findings in

paragraph 31 of this judgment, the final determination made by the Tax Appeals

Commission dated 11.11.2021 is confirmed. The Registrar is directed to send a

certified copy of this judgment to the Tax Appeals Commission.
