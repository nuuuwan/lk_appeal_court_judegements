The definition cannot be overlooked. Therefore, it is seen that letting or leasing of a premises is treated as a business only, if such activities are carried out by a company. In any other circumstances, profit and income from letting premises by any person other than a company is treated as income from renting of properties falling under section 3(g) of the Inland Revenue Act. It has been argued that the term undertaking cannot be restricted to a business and that even facilities for storage would come within the meaning of an undertaking. However, it is seen that the Appellant is only renting out commercial premises. Therefore, the term undertaking referred to in section 58B cannot be applied to treat the activity of the Appellant as a business, in view of the definition of business given in section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act.",

Of course, if there is ambiguity in the statutory language, reference may be made to the legislative intent to resolve the ambiguity. But if the statutory language is unambiguous, then that must be given effect to. The Legislature is deemed to intend and mean what it says. The need for interpretation arises only when the words used in the statute are, on their own terms ambivalent and do not manifest the intention of the Legislature. However, there are exceptions to this rule. The first is that the rule of strict construction does not apply to a provision which merely lays down the machinery for the calculation or procedure for the collection of tax. The second exception is: If two constructions are possible and a strict construction would lead to an absurd result then the construction which is keeping with the object of the statutory provision or in keeping with equity could be accepted.",

The profits earned in such a case are referable, not to the exercise of the rights of property or of occupation since the customers come on to the land for the purpose of obtaining refreshment or procuring the benefit of the services. If on the other hand, the owner of land having (let me suppose) a remarkable view or some historic monument merely allows the public to come on to the land in return for an admission fee, I cannot myself see why it should be said that his profits are not covered by the Schedule A assessment since all that he is doing is to exploit his right of property by grating licences to come upon the land. The fact that he keeps the paths in order or the monument in repair in order to make a visit more attractive to the public again appears to me to make no difference, any more than does the action of the landlord of a house in keeping it in repair.",
