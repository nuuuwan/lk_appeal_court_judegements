Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an application by the accused petitioner namely, Rathnayake Wasala

Mohottilage Rathnasiri alias Ralahamy (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner)

invoking the extraordinary revisionary jurisdiction of this Court in order to

challenge his conviction and the sentence in the High Court of Embilipitiya Case

No.19/2006.

This is a case where the petitioner was indicted before the High Court for causing

the death of one Handunneththige Piyadasa De Silva on 24-11-1991, and

thereby committing the offence of murder, punishable in terms of section 296 of

the Penal Code.

The indictment has been served on the petitioner on 02-08-2002 and the trial

has been fixed for 28-12-2002. After his initial appearance before the High Court,

the petitioner has absconded the Court and as a result, procedure in terms of

section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act has been followed, and the

trial has taken place in his absence on the basis that he is willfully absconding

the Court.

Although the indictment has been filed before the High Court of Rathnapura and

the trial in absentia has also been fixed against the petitioner by the same Court,

since the establishment of a new High Court in Embilipitiya, this case has been

transferred to the High Court of Embilipitiya and the trial has been proceeded

before the said Court.

At the conclusion of the trial, learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya

pronouncing her judgement on 17-11-2008 has found the petitioner guilty as

indicted and he has been sentenced to death in his absentia.

An open warrant has also been issued against the petitioner.

Subsequently, the petitioner had been arrested and produced before the learned

High Court Judge of Embilipitiya on 30-07-2013. The petitioner has claimed that

he is not the person mentioned in the indictment, namely Rathnayake Wasala

Mohottilage Rathnasiri alias Ralahamy, but his name is Handunneththige

Somasiri. This has prompted the learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya to call

for a fingerprint report of him and to initiate an inquiry in order to find out

whether this is the same person mentioned in the indictment and convicted in

absentia. On a subsequent day, after finding that his deception has not worked,

the petitioner has admitted that he is the person mentioned in the indictment.

Subsequently, the petitioner has been allowed to make an application in terms

of section 241 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, allowing him to satisfy

the Court that his absence from the trial was due to bona fide reasons.

The learned High Court Judge, by his Order dated 06-05-2014 had found that

the reasons given by the petitioner cannot be accepted and had rejected his

application. Accordingly, the learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya has

ordered that the sentence be carried out against the petitioner.

Thereafter, the petitioner has filed an appeal challenging his conviction and the

sentence, however, he has withdrawn his appeal as an objection has been raised

that the said appeal has been filed after the lapse of the statutory time period

provided to a person aggrieved by a conviction and a sentence to prefer an appeal

to the Court of Appeal.

It is after the said withdrawal, the petitioner has filed this application in revision

challenging his conviction and the sentence.

Revision is a discretionary remedy vested with the Court of Appeal, which can

be exercised only upon exceptional grounds.

It was held in the case of Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd. Vs. Mercantile Hotels

Management Ltd. (1987) 1 SLR 05 that;

It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the appellate

Court is confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist

warranting its intervention.

In the case of Wijesinghe Vs. Thamaratnam, (Srikantha Law Reports Vol-IV

page 47) it was held that;

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the

application discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of the

Court.

In the case of Vanik Incorporation Ltd. Vs. Jayasekare (1997) 2 SLR 365 it

was held thus;

Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has

occurred due to a fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but only

when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of

justice.

In his petition before this Court, the petitioner has averred the following grounds

as exceptional grounds for him to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this

Court.

1. The evidence adduced in the case ex facie is insufficient to justify a

charge of murder.

2. The judgement of the learned Trial Judge is completely contrary to the

evidence available in the case.

3. The learned Trial Judge has totally disregarded the basic principle of

right to private defence.

Page 5 of 8

4. The man who is entitled to be acquitted currently facing a death penalty

without any legal justification.

5. A grave injustice and prejudice have been caused to the accused-

petitioner.

6. There arises a situation where a delay can be excused.

7. The learned Trial Judge has totally disregarded evidence recorded

which warrants justification of culpable homicide not amounting to

murder (exception 4 of Section 294 of the Penal Code).

8. The entire facts and the circumstances are sufficient to shock the

conscience of the Court.

9. The judgement of the learned Trial Judge marked P-13 and the

sentence marked P-14 and P-14a is erroneous and defective.

10. A failure of justice will definitely occasion to the petitioner provided

Your Lordships Court does not intervene to rectify errors of the said

judgement and sentence.

Objecting to the said application on behalf of the respondent, the Hon. Attorney

General, it has been pointed out that since this is invoking the discretionary

remedy of revision of this Court, it was incumbent upon the petitioner to provide

exceptional grounds to the Court. It was the position of the respondent that the

grounds averred by the petitioner are grounds that cannot be considered as

exceptional.

Furthermore, it was the contention of the respondent that the accused is guilty

of contumacious conduct and hence not entitled to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal and the petitioner has failed to properly

explain the inordinate delay in filing this revision application before the Court of

Appeal.

When this matter was argued before this Court, it was the contention of the

learned Counsel for the petitioner that the facts of this matter as revealed before

the learned High Court Judge points to a conviction in terms of section 297 of

Page 6 of 8

the Penal Code on the basis of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and

the learned High Court Judge has failed to properly analyze the evidence in that

regard. It was his position that a conviction for murder even though the

petitioner has failed to appear before the Court cannot be justified and hence the

conviction should not be allowed to stand.

The learned State Counsel for the respondent was of the view that this is a matter

where the petitioner has gone in search of the deceased and caused fatal injuries

to him by using a knife carried by him. It was her position that there was no

evidence placed before the trial Court that this was a result of a sudden fight or

a provocation by the deceased.

It was her view that the learned High Court Judge has well considered the facts

and the circumstances and pronounced her judgement with sound reasoning,

which need not be disturbed as there are no material to conclude that the

conviction and the sentence would shock the conscience of the Court.

As pointed out correctly by the learned State Counsel this being a revision

application, the petitioner needs to establish exceptional grounds for him to

invoke the extraordinary discretionary remedy of revision which exclusively vests

with this Court.

Although the petitioner has claimed that his delay in filing this application can

be excused, I do not find any reasons for such a conclusion. The petitioner has

evaded his trial and has failed to prefer an appeal against his conviction and the

sentence within the time stipulated by law. He has appeared before the Court

only after he was arrested, and even then, he has claimed that he is not the

person mentioned in the indictment. He has failed to give sufficient reasons to

the learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya to establish that his failure to

appear before the Trial Court was due to bona fide reasons.

He has only filed this application in revision after his appeal against the

conviction and the sentence was withdrawn by him when the respondent took

Page 7 of 8

up a legal objection to it. A person who conducts himself in such a manner

cannot claim that his delay should be excused.

In the case of Sudharman De Silva Vs. The Attorney General (1986) 1 SLR 9,

it was held that the right of appeal is a statutory right and even a person who

absconds the trial has a right to prefer an appeal against the conviction and a

sentence in terms of section 14 of the Judicature Act.

However, it was held that in an application to the Court of Appeal where the

exercise of its discretion is invoked, contumacious conduct on the part of the

appellant is a relevant consideration as in the instant application before the

Court.

Be that as it may, when it comes to the facts that had been elicited by way of

evidence before the trial Court and the judgement pronounced by the learned

High Court Judge of Embilipitiya is concerned, I am not in a position to agree

with the learned Counsels contention that the conviction should have been in

terms of section 297 of the Penal Code. I find that the learned High Court Judge

has well considered whether there was any evidence to bring the charge of

murder down to that of a culpable homicide not amounting to murder. She has

found that the petitioner has come looking for the deceased armed with a knife

and had attacked the deceased. Considering the evidence placed before the

Court, the learned High Court Judge has determined that this was an intentional

act which would not fall under the exceptions of section 294 of the Penal Code.

The learned High Court Judge has also considered the petitioners failure to give

a reasonable explanation as to the highly incriminating evidence placed before

the Court against him which shows that the offence committed by the petitioner

was murder and nothing else.

Although the petitioner has stated right to private defence as one of his

exceptional grounds, there was no material before the trial Court to consider the

facts and circumstances in such a manner.

I do not find any reason to conclude that the conviction and the sentence shocks

the conscience of the Court. On the contrary, I am of the view that the learned

High Court Judge, after considering all the evidence placed before the Court has

come to a correct finding and convicted the petitioner for the offence of murder.

For the reasons mentioned as above, I find no reasons to interfere with the

conviction and the sentence of the petitioner by exercising the discretionary

remedy of revision vested with this Court.

The application of the petitioner is hereby dismissed for want of any merit.

The conviction and the sentence dated 17-11-2008 is affirmed.
