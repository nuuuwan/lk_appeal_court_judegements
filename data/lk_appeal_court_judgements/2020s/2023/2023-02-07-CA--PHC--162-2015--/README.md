Judgment

This is an appeal emanating from an Order of the learned High Court Judge of the

Central Province holden in Kandy. The Respondent-Respondent in this matter had

been absent and unrepresented after being issued notices on several occasions.

However, they had sent letters dated 28.04.2021 and 02.02.2020, informing their

inability to attend Courts since they are under medication resulting from old age

and ill-health.

Page 3 of 5

Hence, the Court fixed this matter for argument and the Appellant agreed to dispose

the matter by way of written submissions already filed. Hence, this Judgment would

be based on the material adduced by parties in their pleadings.

It appears that the Petitioner-Appellant had instituted action against the

Respondent-Respondents in the Magistrates Court of Kandy in case bearing

No.43359, in terms of Section 73 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No.44 of 1979

on the basis that the Respondent-Respondents had breached the final order dated

21.05.1993 made in Primary Court case bearing No.31453 filed under Section 66 of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act No.44 of 1979.

The said Magistrates Court case bearing No.43359 had commenced on 19.03.2013

and after the conclusion of examination in chief of the Petitioner-Appellant, case

was re-fixed for cross examination of the Petitioner-Appellant for 14.05.2013. Since

the Petitioner-Appellant was absent and unrepresented on this day, the said case

had been dismissed for want of appearance.

Consequently, the Petitioner-Appellant had made an application by tendering an

affidavit with a medical certificate to purge the default in appearing in Court.

However, the Court without accepting the medical certificate had dismissed the

application of the Petitioner-Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of dismissal by the learned Magistrate, the

Petitioner-Appellant had invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High

Court of the Central Province holden at Kandy. However, the learned High Court

Judge delivered the Order on 18.11.2015 dismissing the revision application of the

Petitioner-Appellant with cost fixed at Rs.10,000/-. Being dissatisfied by the said

Order, the Petitioner-Appellant had preferred this appeal.

It was emphasized in the case Bandulasena and others vs. Galla Kankanamge

Chaminda Kushantha and others [CA PHC No.147/2009, CA minutes of

27.09.2017];

It would be relevant to bear in mind that the appeal before this Court is an

appeal against a judgment pronounced by the Provincial High Court in

exercising its revisionary jurisdiction. Thus, the task before this Court is not

to consider an appeal against the Primary Court order but to consider an

Page 4 of 5

appeal in which an order pronounced by the Provincial High Court in the

exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction is sought to be impugned.

It is relevant to observe that this Court in the case of Nandawathie and

another Vs. Mahindasena also had taken the above view. It is noteworthy

that this Court in that case had stated that the right given to an aggrieved

party to appeal to the Court of Appeal in a case of this nature should not be

taken as an appeal in the true sense but in fact an application to examine the

correctness, legality or the propriety of the order made by the High Court

Judge in the exercise of its revisionary powers.

It was held in the case of Nandawathi and another Vs. Mahindasena [(2009) 2

SLR 218];

When an Order of a Primary Court Judge is challenged by way of revision in

the High Court, the High Court can examine only the legality of that Order

and not the correction of that Order.

It was emphasized by Ranjith Silva J. that;

I am of the opinion that this particular right of appeal in the circumstances

should not be taken as an appeal in the true sense, but in fact as an

application to examine the correctness, legality or the propriety of the Order

made by the High Court Judge in the exercise of revisionary powers. The Court

of Appeal should not under the guise of an appeal attempt to re-hear or re-

evaluate the evidence led in the main case.

In view of the aforecited Judgment, we are not supposed to consider this as an

appeal preferred against the Order of the Magistrates Court. We are of the view

that the task before this Court is to ascertain whether this appeal emanates from an

Order pronounced by the Provincial High Court in the exercise of its revisionary

jurisdiction. Thus, the Court of Appeal is empowered to evaluate the correctness of

the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction by the Provincial High Court. Similarly, the

Provincial High Courts too should be mindful when exercising revisionary jurisdiction

in respect of applications made against the Orders of the Magistrates Court and

should consider these as revision applications and not as appeals.

According to the findings of the learned High Court Judge, the Order in the

Magistrates Court case No. 43359 was delivered on 23.05.2013 and the revision

application was made on 05.08.2014. The delay was for a period more than one year

and the Petitioner-Appellant had not given any explanation for the delay.

Moreover, the Petitioner-Appellant had not shown exceptional circumstances that

shock the conscience of Court to exercise revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial

High Court of the Central Province. Therefore, it is apparent that the learned High

Court Judge has very correctly held against the Petitioner-Appellant and dismissed

the application of the Petitioner-Appellant.

Thus, we see no reason to interfere with the Order of the learned High Court Judge

dated 18.11.2015 and the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 23.05.2013.

The appeal is dismissed with tax cost.
