This is an appeal against the Order dated 05.11.2019, delivered by the

Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Panadura which

acted in revision and affirmed the vehicle confiscation order dated

05.02.2019, delivered by the Panadura Magistrate Court under the

provisions of the Forest Ordinance. The Petitioner has preferred this

appeal to this Court in order to have both the orders set aside, and thereby

disallow the confiscation of the vehicle bearing registration no. 48 - 4853

(hereinafter the vehicle).

CA-PHC-211-19 Page 4 of 8 07/02/2023 IJ-05-23

The following are the facts of the case. The accused was charged in the

Magistrate Court of Panadura for the offence of transporting an amount of

58 jack fruit logs in the said vehicle without a valid permit, thereby

contravening Sections 40 (4) read with Section 25(1) and Section 25 (2) of

the Forest Ordinance as amended by laws, inter alia, Act no.65 of 2009

(hereinafter the Act). The accused pleaded guilty to the charge and the

Magistrate convicted the accused on 05.09.2018, upon which the accused

was imposed a fine with a default imprisonment sentence. The conviction

of the accused ensued the confiscation of the vehicle in relation to the

offence which was released temporarily to its registered owner, the

claimant- petitioner- appellant (hereinafter the appellant), on a bond of

2,000,000/. After an inquiry into the matters of the appellants knowledge

of the said diversion of the vehicle in relation to the case and whether the

appellant has taken sufficient precautionary measures to prevent such an

offence, the Magistrate set out the order dated 05.02.2019 to confiscate

the vehicle.

Aggrieved by the said Order dated 05.02.2019, the appellant filed for

revision in the High Court of Panadura, and the revision application was

refused by the learned High Court Judge for want of necessary precautions

on the part of the appellant to prevent the commission of the offence under

the Forest Ordinance. Hence, the appellant has preferred the instant

appeal to the Court of Appeal, seeking to set aside the order dated

05.02.2019 of the Magistrate Court and the order dated 05.11.2019 of the

High Court.

Before diving into an analysis of the merits, it is apt to quote the relevant

law in this instant application. Thus, Section 40 of the Act is quoted as

follows:

5

CA-PHC-211-19 Page 5 of 8 07/02/2023 IJ-05-23

(1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence

(a) all timber or forest produce which is not the property of the State

in respect of which such offence has been committed; and

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in

committing such offence,

shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such offence,

be confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence, is

a third party, no Order of Confiscation shall be made if such owner

proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements,

cattle and machines, as the case may be, for the commission of the

offence. (Emphasis added)

As such, the legislature on Forest Law has unequivocally casted a burden

on the third party of an offence within the ambit of Section 40 to dispense

the burden of proving to the satisfaction of the court that he, as the

registered owner of the vehicle in dispute, has taken necessary

precautionary measures to prevent the vehicle from being employed in acts

of crime. Therefore, the court primarily looks into the contention of

whether the learned Magistrate has correctly evaluated the evidence

presented before the Court in arriving at the final determination that the

appellant has failed to dispense the said burden.

The Magistrate Court, followed by the High Court decided against the

appellant for want of satisfactory show of cause as to why the vehicle

should be released to the appellant. The learned Magistrate, in delivering

the impugned order, has firstly examined whether the appellant has

6

CA-PHC-211-19 Page 6 of 8 07/02/2023 IJ-05-23

sufficiently established the ownership to the vehicle and after affirming

such evaluation, the learned Magistrate has evaluated the submissions

presented by the appellant, during which, certain discrepancies in the

presented evidence were noted to hold that the appellant has failed to

constitute, on a balance of probability, the burden of proving to the

satisfaction of the court, that the appellant has unequivocally dispensed

the burden casted on him by the Forest Ordinance.

It was the contention of the appellant that, he has taken necessary

precautions to preclude the vehicle from being employed in illegal

activities. In furtherance, he has stated before the learned Magistrate that

he has given specific instructions to not to engage the vehicle beyond

Moratuwa town and that he was constantly updated about the

whereabouts of the vehicle. However, it was the determination of the

learned Magistrate that as there were no evidence to corroborate the said

evidence, a mere statement with regards to giving instructions to the

accused does not satisfy the burden casted on the appellant to prove, on

a balance of probability that he has taken the necessary precautions to

prevent the commission of an offence. At this juncture, it is apt to quote

the observations made in Samarasinghege Dharmasena v W. P.

Wanigasinghe CA(PHC) 197/2013 CA Minute dated 22.01.2019, where

its stipulated that it is amply clear that simply giving instructions to the

driver is insufficient to discharge the burden cast on a vehicle owner.

Therefore, merely giving instructions alone will not fall under the possible

preventive measures ought to be taken by a vehicle owner.

In the matter at hand, the appellant contends that he has given

instructions to the accused to abstain from using the vehicle for illegal

activities. Albeit there is no evidence to corroborate the evidence provided

by the appellant. The mere statement without any corroboration of the

7

CA-PHC-211-19 Page 7 of 8 07/02/2023 IJ-05-23

evidence by the appellant that he has given instructions and inquired

about the whereabouts of the vehicle does not satisfy the court of the

appellants position. Therefore, in the absence of any such reasonable

steps taken to ensure the prevention of the involvement of the vehicle in

illegal activities, the learned High Court Judge has observed that there

were no exceptional circumstances to shock the conscious of the court and

there was no illegality in the order of the learned Magistrate to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court.

However, it is more appropriate to note that corroboration of evidence is

not imperative where there is irrefutable evidence at face value provided

by the appellant to satisfy the court on a balance of probability that

necessary precautionary measures have been taken as a reasonable owner

of the vehicle to prevent the commission of offences by using the vehicle.

As held in S. D. N. Premasiri v Officer In Charge, Mawathagama C A

(PHC) 46/2015 Court of Appeal Minute dated 27.11.2018 it is

imperative to prove to the satisfaction of Court that the vehicle owner in

question has not only given instructions but also has taken every possible

step to implement them. It is observed by this Court that, in this instant

application, the appellant has proved neither.

Moreover, this Court is of the observation that there are discrepancies in

the evidence provided by the appellant during the inquiry with regards to

having knowledge of the whereabouts of the vehicle. It was revealed before

the Magistrate Court that the taking to custody of the vehicle took place

on 10.05.2018, however the appellant was informed on the 25.05.2018

that the was vehicle was taken into custody and thus duly produced

before the court after 15 days of such custody of the vehicle. Therefore, it

is evident that the appellants averment that he knew of the whereabouts

of the vehicle on a daily basis is refutable as he was not aware of the taking

8

CA-PHC-211-19 Page 8 of 8 07/02/2023 IJ-05-23

the vehicle to the custody of for fifteen days. This is a testament to his

lackadaisical attitude towards his vehicle as the registered owner of the

vehicle, and thus this Court is of the observation, that there are no

precautionary measures taken to prevent the vehicle from being used in

illegal activities and the appellant has failed to duly dispense the burden

cast on him by Section 40 of the Act.

Therefore, in the absence of evidence stating otherwise, it is considered the

view of this Court, since the appellant has failed to dispense the burden

cast on him, that the learned Magistrate has duly concluded the matter at

hand and the High Court has correctly dismissed the revision application.

Accordingly, we see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned

High Court Judge dated 05.11.2019 and the confiscation order of the

learned Magistrate dated 05.02.2019. Therefore, this Court affirms the

same.

The appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
