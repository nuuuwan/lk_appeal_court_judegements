B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Petitioner, the sole proprietor of COOLMan Ice Factory which is engaged in

the business of manufacturing blocks of ice (P1), invokes this Courts writ jurisdiction,

conferred by virtue of Article 140 of the Constitution, praying for a writ of Certiorari to

quash a resolution of the Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha (Resolution bearing No. 11/21-

03-2019 dated 21st March 2019 P6) to prevent the transportation of groundwater

extracted from a land belonging to the Petitioner (which is situated within the territorial

limits of the said Pradeshiya Sabha) to the land on which the factory is situated (which is

situated outside the territorial limits of the said Pradeshiya Sabha). The extracted

groundwater is required for the purpose of manufacturing ice.

It must be noted that what the Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha has opposed is not

the extraction of groundwater but rather the transportation of the extracted groundwater

to land situated outside the territorial limits of the Pradeshiya Sabha for a commercial

purpose i.e., manufacturing blocks of ice. There was no reason forthcoming at the time of

the passing of the impugned resolution nor is there any reason disclosed to this Court as

to why the Pradeshiya Sabha objected to the same.

The relevant authority tasked with overseeing the extraction of groundwater, for

the purpose of the instant application, is the Water Resources Board (the 41st

Respondent). For the purpose of clarity, the Water Resources Board Act No. 29 of 1964,

as amended by Act No. 42 of 1999, facilitated the establishment of the Water Resources

Board (hereinafter referred to as the Board) which is tasked with advising the Minister

concerned on the matters set out in Section 12(1) of the said Act, which includes, inter

alia, the control, regulation, and development of water resources of the country and the

prevention of pollution of rivers, streams, and other water resources. Section 12(3) sets

out a non-exhaustive list of activities the Board is empowered to perform in order to enable

it to effectually perform its duties under Section 12(1). These activities include carrying

out feasibility studies on the availability of groundwater resources; carrying out

hydrogeological investigations to identify groundwater sites for deep tube wells and agro

wells; the construction of tube wells in a scientific manner to enable the extraction of

groundwater for domestic, agricultural and industrial purposes and the drilling of

boreholes to investigate the subsurface strata.

5

In pursuance of the said statutory functions vested in it, the Board promulgated

certain rules under the hand of the Minister concerned, in terms of Section 16 of the said

Act. These rules were published in Gazette bearing No. 2010/23 dated 16th March 2017

(P3). The rules require any entity that uses groundwater for any commercial purpose to

carry out the project with the approval of and under the supervision of the Board. A

procedure was adopted by the Board for granting approval, which the Board itself admits

(vide motion dated 22nd October 2020) that the Petitioners factory has duly complied with.

The Petitioner annexed a letter dated 10th December 2019 (bearing reference no.

PM/NP/JAF/2019-01 P12) by which the Water Resources Board has granted approval

for groundwater extraction.

The chain of events leading to the present application commenced when the 2nd

Respondent (Chairman of the Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha) required that an application

be made to him for permission to transport the extracted groundwater, which the

Petitioner had duly furnished (P4). In response to this letter, the 2nd Respondent by

letter dated 9th April 2019 (P5) wrote to the Petitioner that permission cannot be granted

to transport groundwater to a land situated outside the territorial limits of the Pradeshiya

Sabha for commercial purposes because a resolution bearing No. 11/21-03-2019 (P6) had

been passed preventing the same.

It also appears, on a perusal of the statement given to the Police (P8) by the

Petitioners agent, that acting in pursuance of the impugned resolution, the Chairman of

the Pradeshiya Sabha had on occasion forcibly prevented the transportation of the

extracted groundwater.

It must be reiterated that the actions of the Petitioner are with the due sanction

of the relevant authority i.e. the Water Resources Board, which had followed the statutory

procedure and approved the extraction of groundwater. The Respondent Pradeshiya

Sabha could have, at the least, agitated their concerns to the Water Resources Board by

making representations, before passing the impugned resolution. On the contrary, the

Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha had written (this too, only after the Respondent

Pradeshiya Sabha had refused permission) to the Water Resources Board only inquiring

whether the Board had granted permission to the Petitioners factory to extract

groundwater (P9). If there were genuine concerns pertaining to the water reserves of

6

the area and the Petitioners usage operating in the mind of the Respondent Pradeshiya

Sabha it could have raised its concerns about the groundwater reserves with the Board.

While it has not communicated the same to the Board, if there were any such

concerns, the same could have been ideally informed to the Petitioner. In a constitutional

structure built on the bedrock principle of the rule of law, instead of resorting to self-help

measures or taking the law into ones own hands, the Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha could

have exercised civility and informed its concerns to the Petitioner, if they had any concern,

before obstructing the transportation of extracted groundwater.

Even at the time of refusal or thereafter, there is no reason forthcoming from the

Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha why transportation of extracted groundwater is

prohibited. It is not only the Petitioner, but also this Court that is left in the dark, having

to guess what those concerns, if any, might have been. This is conduct contrary to the

principles of good administration. The absence of any reasons renders the Petitioners

ability to have the decision judicially reviewed nugatory. For instance, in R v. Secretary

of State for the Home Department ex parte Doody [1993] 3 WLR 154, [1994] 1 A.C. 531

Lord Mustill found that there was a duty to give reasons, because the reasons would

facilitate any judicial review challenge by the prisoner. His Lordship held:

To mount an effective attack on the decision, given no more material than the facts of the

offence and the length of the penal element, the prisoner has virtually no means of ascertaining

whether this is an instance where the decision-making process has gone astray. I think it

important that there should be an effective means of detecting the kind of error which would entitle

the court to intervene, and in practice I regard it as necessary for this purpose that the reasoning

of the Home Secretary should be disclosed.

More fundamentally, the absence of reasons, when there is no apparent legal basis

for the decision, will enable us to safely draw the presumption that the decision was

arbitrary. In Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food [1968] 2 WLR 924,

[1968] AC 997, the House of Lords famously held that if a prima facie case of unlawfulness

was established by a Petitioner and the Respondent has not given any good reasons for

pursuing the impugned course of action the court could infer that there was no good

reason to take such a course of action.

De Smiths Judicial Review 8th edition notes:

Where an applicant seeks to impugn a decision of an administrative authority other than

by claiming non-compliance with a duty to give reasons- for example by challenging the legality or

rationality of decisions- a failure by that authority to offer any answer to the allegations may justify

an inference that its reasons were bad in law or that it had exercised its powers unlawfully.

Absurd or perverse decisions may be presumed to have been decided in that fashion [emphasis

added]

Having analyzed the authorities on the duty to give reasons her Ladyship Dr.

Shirani Bandaranayake J. (as she then was) in Hapuarachchi v. Commissioner of

Elections [2009] 1 SLR 1 at 13 held:

On a consideration of our case law in the light of the attitude taken by Courts in other

countries, it is quite clear that giving reasons to an administrative decision is an important feature

in todays context, which cannot be lightly disregarded. Moreover, in a situation, where giving

reasons have been ignored, such a body would run the risk of having acted arbitrarily, in coming

to their conclusion.

It also appears on a perusal of the documents that the Respondent Pradeshiya

Sabha, as alluded to above, sought to ascertain the views of the Water Resources Board

only after it had resolved to refuse permission to transport extracted groundwater,

substantiating our observation that the decision is arbitrary. An arbitrary exercise of

power is the antithesis of the rule of law.

Notwithstanding the aforesaid discussion, what is appalling to this Court is the

absence of any legal basis for the conduct of the Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha to pass a

resolution to prevent the transportation of extracted groundwater, which has been duly

approved by the relevant authority in law tasked with the same. It is trite that the

absence of any legal basis for the exercise of power renders that exercise of power ultra

vires.

If there was a genuine concern as to the scarcity of groundwater in the Jaffna

peninsula, it could have been brought to the attention of the Water Resources Board.

Nevertheless, we are mindful that Pradeshiya Sabhas are established for the well-being

of inhabitants of the localities it governs. If, therefore, there exists a genuine concern as

8

to the scarcity of groundwater, the Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha is not hindered to raise

that concern with the Water Resources Board for the Board to make an assessment, if

needed.

For those reasons, we grant the relief prayed for.
