Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The primary issue which needs to be resolved in the instant Application is whether the

determination of the Assistant Commissioner of Labour-1st Respondent registering the

2nd Respondent Association as a Trade Union is lawful. The said Association is comprised

with life insurance agents as its members. The Petitioner is seeking, inter alia, for a writ of

Certiorari quashing the decision contained in letter dated 28.10.2021, marked 'P5', by

which the 1st Respondent has refused to cancel his determination to register the above

Trade Union.

The 1st Respondent affirming an affidavit submits that she has decided to register the 2nd

Respondent Association as a Trade Union as per the provisions of the Trade Union

Ordinance No. 14 of 1935 ('Ordinance'). She alleges that;

Page 3 of 9

a) she was satisfied that the 2nd Respondent Trade Union was 'an Association or a

combination of workmen' falling within the meaning of the said Ordinance,

b) the interpretation of the term 'workmen' in the Ordinance is wide enough to

encompass the members of the 2nd Respondent Trade Union, i.e. Insurance Agents,

c) there is no statutory provision which outright prohibits and/or prevents her from

recognizing insurance agents as 'workmen' under the Ordinance.

The Petitioner's main contention is that there is a stringent and separate statutory legal

regime that governs insurance agents to that of workmen/employees and insurance agents

are prohibited in law from being workmen/employees. The Petitioner asserts that under

the law a trade union can only be formed and registered by workmen/employees and thus,

the insurance agents being independent contractors cannot in law form and/or join and/or

register a trade union under the Ordinance as they are not 'workmen' under the said

Ordinance.

The 3rd Respondent who associates with the submissions made on behalf of the Petitioner

contends that the insurance agents are independent contractors and not

workmen/employees of the insurers or brokers with whom they are registered, in terms of

the Regulations of Insurance Industry Act No. 43 of 2000 (as amended) and Rules and

Determinations made thereunder.

Initially, the Court needs to examine whether the members of the 2nd Respondent

Association come within the definition of 'workman' in the said Ordinance. It can be seen

that various verbal or written contracts exist between employers and employees but all

such employees/workmen cannot fall into the category of the 'workman' defined in

different statutes. If the workman fall into such definition, generally he/she may be entitled

to the benefits under the respective statutes as well as under other Acts which provide

statutory benefits in the labour law regime. Similarly, it needs consideration whether the

'insurance agents' collectively can be considered as workmen. In this regard, it is

paramount to assess the true nature of the employment relationship between an employer

and an employee/workman.

'The employment relationship in Sri Lanka is based on the Employer-Employee

relationship, which over the years has gained protection under the law. The common Law

concept of the contract based on a Master and servant relationship under the Roman

Page 4 of 9

Dutch Law, which was later influenced by the English Law concepts. The influence of

English Law was seen mostly in the area of the rights and liabilities of the Master and

servant relationship in regard to third parties.' (vide-'The Employment Relationship (scope)

in Sri Lanka' by R.K.S. Suresh Chandra J. [an article published in the International Labour

Organization website1 when he was serving as a legal Counsel specialized in labour law])

It appears that the Sri Lankan Courts in determining the relationship between the

employer and the employee have used the traditional tests i.e., (1) the control test, (2) the

integration test and (3) the economic reality test. The case of Stevenson, Jordan and

Harrison Ltd. vs. MacDonald and Evans (1952) 1 TLR 101 is a case where the above tests

were employed in determining the issues of the said case. Although it was decided in 1952,

the judicial precedent enunciated in the said case can be considered as valid even in today's

context.

Lord Justice Denning has stated in the above case that it is often easy to recognize a

contract of service when you see it but difficult to say where in the difference lies. 'A ship's

master, a chauffeur, and a reporter on the staff of a newspaper are all employed under a

contract of service; but a ship's pilot, a taxi-man, and a newspaper contributor are

employed under a contract for services. One feature which seems to run through the

instances is that, under a contract of service, a man is employed as part of the business,

and his work is done as an integral part of the business; whereas, under a contract for

services, his work, although done for the business, is not integrated into it but is only

accessory to it..' He has further stated that it is almost impossible to give a precise definition

to the distinction.

In Collins vs. Herts County Council (1947) 10 K.B. 598 (at p. 615), Justice Hilbery, has stated

that 'The distinction between a contract for services and a contract of service can be

summarized in this way: In the one case the master can order or require what is to be done,

while in the other case he can not only order or require what is to be done but how it shall

be done'.

The above tests have been discussed even in United States in the cases of United States vs.

Silk 331 U.S. 704 (1947) and Harrison, Collector of Internal Revenue vs. Greyvan Lines, Inc

329 U.S. 709 (1947) which dealt with driver-owners of trucks. It was held in the above two

1 https://ilo.org/ifpdial/areas-of-work/labour-law/WCMS_205382/lang--en/index.htm

Page 5 of 9

cases which were considered together; 'The problem of differentiating between employee

and an independent contractor or between an agent and an independent contractor has

given difficulty through the years before social legislation multiplied its importance.....The

distinction, though important, is not controlling. It is the total situation, including the risk

undertaken, the control exercised, the opportunity for profit from sound management, that

marks these driver-owners as independent contractors'.

In Market Investigations Ltd. vs. Minister of Social Security (1969) 2 QB 173, the Queen's

Bench Division (Administrative Court England and Wales) referring even to the above

United States vs. Silk 331 U.S. 704 (1947) case has observed that; 'The observations of Lord

Wright, of Denning L.J. and of the judges of the Supreme Court suggest that the

fundamental test to be applied is this: "Is the person who has engaged himself to perform

these services performing them as a person in business on his own account?" If the answer

to that question is "yes," then the contract is a contract for services. If the answer is "no,"

then the contract is a contract of service.'

Now, I must consider whether an express or implied contract, involving insurance agents

in respect of their services, will usually be a contract of service or contract for service.

When examining the nature of services of an insurance agent, the Section 114 of the

Regulation of Insurance Industry Act No. 43 of 2000 (as amended) and Regulations made

thereunder have a vital impact.

Section 114;

'"insurance agent means an individual registered as an insurance agent with an

insurer or broker under the provisions of this Act, and who in consideration of a

commission solicits or procures insurance business for such insurer or broker as the

case may be';

The Rule 2 of the Rules made under the said Act ('P2a') provides the basic qualifications

for a person to be registered as an insurance agent. Among other qualifications, the said

Rule 2(g) implies that a salaried employee of a registered Insurer or Broker cannot be

registered as an insurance agent.

In light of the above, I take the view that a person registered as an insurance agent with an

insurer or broker under the provisions of the said Regulations of Insurance Industry Act

and who in consideration of a commission solicits or procures insurance business for such

Page 6 of 9

insurer or broker rather than drawing a salary periodically should be considered as an

insurance agent under our law. The interpretation given in the said Regulations of

Insurance Industry Act and the Rules made thereunder, draw a clear inference that a

service contract between the insurance agent and insurer should be assumed as a contract

for services and not as a contract of service. Anyhow, I take the view that such contract

cannot be assumed as a contract for service if such insurance agent gains additional

benefits such as promotions, payments in the mode of a salary or increments thereto or

hold designations in the company cadre etc. In other words, the nature of the relationship

between the insurance agent and the insurer/broker may convert the relevant contract to

a contract of service from the state of contract for service. Certainly, the true nature of the

contract can be ascertained by employing the above tests such as the control test,

integration test etc.

In view of the above judicial precedent and the legal jurisprudence which paved way to

identify the types of employment, it appears that an employee cannot be classified as an

insurance agent/casual employee/temporary employee/seasonal employee/apprentice/

trainee based on a mere format of a written agreement or on a verbal contract. In other

words, in order to identify and understand the true nature of such employment, it is not

sufficient to specify the category of employment in the contract but it needs an assessment

based on the true relationship between the employer and the employee. Thus, a mere label

of an 'insurance agent' cannot be considered as an accessory to assess whether such agent

would come within the definition of workmen stipulated in the said Ordinance.

'A workman is governed by a contract of service and an independent contractor is

governed by contract for service. However, the decision as to the nature of the contract to

identify whether a person providing services to an organization is a workman under a

contract of service or an independent contractor under a contract for service becomes

difficult with globalization, changes in employment methods, flexibilities in employment,

developments in science and technology and the devices designed by employers to

circumvent their obligations. In many cases, employers who have power to include clauses

favourable for them due to unequal bargaining power between the parties have included

designations such as self-employed persons, agents, consultants, free-lancers and sub-

contractors to label the workmen as independent contractors with the belief that they could

circumvent their statutory obligations'. (Vide- A. Sarveswaran, 'Who is a Workman? A

Page 7 of 9

critical evaluation of the tests to differentiate a workman from an Independent Contractor in the

light of judicial decisions' - International Research Conference on Management and

Finance University of Colombo IRCMF 20112)

The Construction Industry Training Board vs. Labour Force Ltd. (1970) 3 All ER 220 is a case

where it had been discussed about a contract sui generis which can be different from

contract of service and contract from service. Fisher J. in the above case has referred to

Atiyah's (P. S. Atiyah, 'Vicarious Liability in the Law of Torts', 1967, p. 38) following

words; '........Clearly not all of these factors will be relevant in all cases, or have the same

weight in all cases. Equally clearly no magic formula can be propounded for determining

which factors should, in any given case, be treated as the determining ones. The plain fact

is that in a large number of cases the court can only perform a balancing operation,

weighing up the factors which point in one direction and balancing them against those

pointing in the opposite direction. In the nature of things it is not to be expected that this

operation can be performed with scientific accuracy.'

Samarakoon CJ. and Wanasundara J. in Ceylon Mercantile Union vs. Ceylon Fertilizer

Corporation (1985) 1 Sri. L.R. 401 have referred to Fisher J.'s above judgement. The said

Ceylon Mercantile Union case is a matter where the court discussed about a contract of

service and also the nexus between the Hunupitiya Labour Co-operative Society (one of

the respondents) and the workmen.

In this backdrop, the crucial issue is how an insurance agent can be excluded from the

definition of workmen stipulated in the said Ordinance. The Section 2 of the said

Ordinance defines the word 'workman' as;

workman means any person who has entered into or works under a contract with

an employer in any capacity, whether the contract is express or implied, oral or in

writing, and whether it is a contract of service or of apprenticeship, or a contract

personally to execute any work or labour and includes any person ordinarily

employed under any such contract, whether such person is or is not in employment

at any particular time.

It is an accepted norm that a person who engages in contract for service or an independent

contractor cannot be considered as a regular employee of the person who obtains services

(principal party). On a careful perusal of the above interpretation section, it appears that

the contract for services is excluded from the said definition. The maxim expressio unius est

exclusio alterius (a Latin term literally meaning "the expression of one thing is the exclusion

of the other") can be adopted here to further clarify my above finding as the said Section

has specifically used the words 'contract of service'. Then it is the prime duty of the

Registrar of Trade Union (1st Respondent) to independently be satisfied whether the

members of the Association who seek registration come within the definition of workmen.

The contention of the 1st Respondent is that she has acted in terms of Section 10 of the

said Ordinance and decided to register the 2nd Respondent-Association as a Trade Union

after satisfying herself that the objects and rules/constitution ('1R2') of the 2nd Respondent

did not conflict with the provisions of the said Ordinance. Further, the 1st Respondent

contends that the term 'workman' in the said Ordinance is wide enough to encompass

members of the 2nd Respondent-Association. As per the affidavit filed by her, she has

arrived at that conclusion on the basis that the insurance agents have been recognized as

falling within the definition of 'workman' under the Industrial Disputes Act by labour

tribunal and High Courts of Sri Lanka. Ironically, the submissions (paragraph 30 of the

written submission dated 09.03.2023) made on behalf of the 1st Respondent clearly

envisage that there was nothing before the 1st Respondent to indicate to him that the

members of the 2nd Respondent-Association fell outside the definition of Section 2 of the

Ordinance. This clearly establishes the fact that the 1st Respondent has not taken into

consideration the salient features of the service contracts of the members of the said

Association. The Constitution, marked '1R2', illustrates the fact that the members of the

2nd Respondent-Association are employees who engage in life insurance industry on

contract basis in all the life insurance institutions. A mere statement to that effect in the

Constitution is not sufficient for the 1st Respondent to be satisfied that the members of the

said Association falls within the definition of Section 2 of the Ordinance. I am of the view

that a grave responsibility will be cast upon the 1st Respondent to examine, at least

randomly, the salient features of the contracts between such members and the relevant life

insurance institutions. This is because the issue whether the 'insurance agents' are

independent contractors was an outstanding question within the insurance industry in the

country for a considerable period of time.

Page 9 of 9

Thus, I take the view that the 1st Respondent has not adopted a lawful mechanism in

arriving at the impugned decision, especially in reference to the question whether the

relationship between such members and the life insurance institutions are in the nature of

contract for services/independent contractors. Even this Court is unable to assess and

determine whether the members of the 2nd Respondent-Association come within the

definition of 'workman' in the Ordinance as there are no evidence before Court to make

such determination.

In the above-mentioned case of Construction Industry Training Board vs. Labour Force Ltd.,

Fisher J. has further observed that the question whether a contract is one of service or is a

contract for services is a question of fact. He has further stated that it is, 'however, a

question of law what are the right tests to be applied in determining whether a contract

falls into the one or the other class, and a decision of the tribunal could be upset by this

Court if it was of the opinion that the tribunal had applied the wrong tests, in other words

had misdirected itself in law,...'

Based on the above circumstances, I am inclined to issue a writ of Certiorari quashing the

decision of the 1st Respondent reflected in letter dated 28.10.2021 ('P5') and also the

decision of the 1st Respondent to register the 2nd Respondent-Association under the

Ordinance. In light of the above, I proceed further to issue a writ of Mandamus directing

the 1st Respondent to delete and/or expunge from the Registrar of the Trade Unions, the

registration of the 2nd Respondent Association as a Trade Union and also to cancel the

respective certificate of registration.

Application is allowed.
