The main reliefs sought by the Petitioner in this instant Application, inter

alia, are as follows

a) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents from

holding the interviews and appointing to the post of Chief Accountant in

violation of rules and laws in contravention of Act marked 'X1'

b) A Mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari to quash the interview

taking place for the post of Chief Accountant and filling of the vacancy by

1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents and their agents and/or servants and/or

representatives from acting in any manner which would be prejudicial and

contrary to board rules and requirements;

c) A Mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the appointment

and declaring it null and void if the vacancy has been filled;

d) A Mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st, 2nd,

and 3rd Respondents and their agents and/or servants and/or

representatives by granting an opportunity to the Petitioner to face the

interview in a reasonable manner

The sequence of facts to the instant Application pursued are as follows.

The Petitioner is currently in employment of the 1st Respondent, National

Water Supply and Drainage Board, as a Senior Internal Auditor. It is

Page 4 of 6

averred by the Petitioner that she tendered an application with regard to a

vacancy for the post of Chief Accountant which was advertised by the 1st

Respondent board (X10, X11, X12). It is further stated by the Petitioner

that despite tendering her application, she was not invited to partake in

the said interview and purportedly, the majority of the candidates invited

for the interview are less qualified than the Petitioner, and do not meet the

threshold of the requisite criteria in order to partake in such an interview.

Thus, it is contended by the Petitioner that the Respondents in failing to

give reasons for not inviting the Petitioner for the conducting of the

interview has gravely prejudiced her, as it is the view of the Petitioner that

she suffices all the necessitated pre requisites in order to partake in the

interview.

In response to the above aggrievement by the Petitioner, it is contended by

the 1st Respondent that the Petitioner was not invited for the interview as

she was not qualified to apply for the post on the basis that, due to various

disciplinary misconducts of the Petitioner during her tenure of

employment at the 1st Respondent Board, she was subjected to a

Disciplinary Inquiry, upon interdiction which concluded with her being

found guilty for 5 of the 8 charges against her (R8). Pursuant to the

findings and recommendations of the Disciplinary Inquirer, she was meted

out with a punishment which precluded the Petitioner from receiving any

Page 5 of 6

promotions for 5 years from the date of the decision of the Inquiry (R9).

The implementation of such a punishment was taken in alignment with

the provisions of the National Water & Drainage Board Disciplinary Code

which specifies under 24:3:12, which reads;

.

Thus, it is posited by the Respondent board that the Petitioner was not

called for the interview in view of the punishment meted out to her, which

was in force at the time of the vacancy for the post of Chief Accountant

being published.

However, be that as it may, it is averred by the Petitioner that she has filed

an appeal against the decision of the Disciplinary Inquirer dated

15.06.2018 (Y7). It is further admitted by the Petitioner that the said

appeal is still in its pendency, with no conclusion reached as of yet. In lieu

of the appeal in pendency, it is the view of the Petitioner that findings of

the Disciplinary Committee, and the punishment cannot be implemented

as there is an appeal in pendency. I find this view to be misconstrued for

the reasons that I have set out below.

The position that the original decision falls into abrogation when there is

a pending appeal is erroneous. The more apt position is that the original

Page 6 of 6

decision of the Inquirer is in full effect, and stands until the verdict of the

appeal in derived. One cannot say that the original decision is invalid on

the mere basis of a pending appeal that has been preferred.

Thus, in the instant Application, it is clear for the reasons set out above,

the original decision of the Inquirer and the punishments derived from

such a decision does not go into abeyance on the mere basis that an appeal

has been preferred by the Petitioner. The punishment of a restriction on

promotions for a period of 5 years as per the Disciplinary Code is still in

force. On that basis, the decision of not calling the Petitioner for the

interview is justifiable on the part of the Respondent Board.

On the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the Application without cost.

No cost.

Application dismissed.
