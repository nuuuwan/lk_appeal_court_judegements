Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an application invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court granted

in terms of Article 138 of The Constitution.

When this matter was supported for notice, this Court having considered the

relevant facts and the circumstances, decided to issue notice to the respondents

mentioned. The respondents were allowed to file their respective objections

accordingly.

At the hearing of this matter, this Court heard the submissions of the learned

Counsel for the accused-appellant-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

petitioner) and also the submissions of the learned State Counsel who

represented the respondents.

In the prayer of the petition filed before this Court by the petitioner, several main

reliefs have been sought. He has sought to set aside the judgement of the

Provincial High Court of the Southern Province Holden in Hambantota in Case

Number HCA/14/2018 dated 16-09-2022. The petitioner has also sought to get

the conviction and the sentence of him in the Magistrates Court of Hambantota

Case Number 42328 set aside. In the alternative, he is seeking to have a

suspended sentence imposed on him in lieu of the sentence imposed upon him

in the Magistrates Court of Hambantota Case Number 42328.

It appears from the averments of the petition that the petitioner is seeking to

challenge the judgement by the learned Provincial High Court Judge of the

Southern Province Holden in Hambantota, where he challenged the sentence

imposed upon him in the Magistrates Court of Hambantota Case Number

42328.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner informed at the outset of the hearing that

although it has been mentioned that the petitioner is challenging the conviction

of him by the Magistrates Court, he is also challenging the sentence imposed

upon him. It is clear from the High Court case record that the petitioner has only

challenged his sentence when the matter was taken up before the High Court.

The petitioner has been charged before the Magistrates Court of Hambantota on

four counts.

He has been charged for setting fire to the house of one Sunil Bandara and his

family members on 16-05-1999, and thereby causing mischief, punishable in

terms of section 419 of the Penal Code.

He has been charged for house trespass of the house belonging to Sunil Bandara,

and thereby committing an offence punishable in terms of section 433 of the

Penal Code.

In addition to the above two charges, he has been charged for causing grievous

hurt to one Hathagala Patabandige Jinadasa, and thereby committing an offence

Page 5 of 10

punishable in terms of section 317 of the Penal Code, and at the same time and

at the same transaction, causing hurt to Sunil Bandara, one Manel and

Wijesekara Arachchige Podi Nona, and thereby committing an offence

punishable in terms of section 314 of the Penal Code.

After trial, the learned Magistrate of Hambantota has found the petitioner guilty

for the 1st, 2nd and the 4th counts preferred against him and had found the

petitioner guilty for the count 3 in terms of section 314 of the Penal Code instead

of section 317 for which he was charged by his judgement dated 28-06-2007.

The petitioner has been sentenced by the learned Magistrate accordingly. It is

clear from the sentencing order that the learned Magistrate has considered the

fact that the petitioner has no previous convictions, his age, the fact that he is

married and is having a child and the other mitigatory circumstances before

passing the sentence on the petitioner.

The petitioner has been sentenced in the following manner.

1. On the 1st count, 1-year rigorous imprisonment and in addition

Rs.1500/- fine.

2. On count 2, 3 months rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.100/-.

3. On count 3, 9 months rigorous imprisonment and in addition

Rs.1000/- fine.

4. On count 4, 6 months rigorous imprisonment and in addition

Rs.1000/- fine.

It has been ordered that if the petitioner fails to pay the total fine, he shall be

sentenced for a period of 4 months simple imprisonment. The total period of

rigorous imprisonment imposed upon the petitioner was two and half years in

total.

The petitioner has appealed against his conviction and sentence. However, when

this matter was taken up for consideration before the learned Provincial High

Court Judge of the Southern Province Holden in Hambantota, it has been

Page 6 of 10

observed that the petitioner has in fact challenged only the sentence imposed

upon him.

Accordingly, the learned High Court Judge has considered whether the sentence

imposed was in order.

The learned Counsel who represented the petitioner before the High Court has

taken up two grounds of appeal, namely,

1. The Magistrates Court failed to follow the provisions of section 182(1).

Therefore, the sentencing order is ab initio void.

2. The sentence was against the law.

Section 182 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act refers to the requirement of a

Magistrate to frame a charge against the accused. The contention had been that

although there is a charge sheet available in the Magistrates Court case record,

it has not been initialed and dated.

The judgement of the learned High Court Judge clearly demonstrates that the

learned High Court Judge has well considered this contention. It has been

observed that the journal entry dated 12-07-2001 indicates that the petitioner

had been charged and he has pleaded not guilty to the charge, although the

learned Magistrate who charged the petitioner has not signed the charge sheet.

However, the learned High Court Judge has found that the trial has proceeded

on the basis of the accused pleading not guilty to the charges. When the defence

was called after the prosecution case, the petitioner has given evidence and had

admitted that the charge sheet was read and explained to him, which goes on to

show that the petitioner very well knew that the trial proceeded against him only

because he pleaded not guilty to the charge.

The learned High Court Judge has drawn his attention to section 436 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act, which reads as follows.

Page 7 of 10

436. Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgment

passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or

altered on appeal or revision on account

(a) of any error, omission, or irregularity in the complaint, summons,

warrant, charge, judgment, summing up, or other proceedings before

or during trial or in any inquiry or other proceedings under this Code

; or

(b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135,

unless such error, omission, irregularity, or want has occasioned a

failure of justice.

It has been correctly determined that there was no failure of justice, or prejudice

caused to the petitioner merely because the charge sheet had not been signed by

the learned Magistrate.

It is quite apparent from the judgement of the learned High Court Judge that the

mitigatory circumstances that were considered by the learned Magistrate in

imposing the sentence on the accused has been well considered to come to a

finding whether the sentence was excessive.

At the hearing of this revision application, it came to light that the petitioner

along with some others including another brother of him had gone to attack the

house, which was set on fire. The injured persons are his own father and the

mother and the other family members. When the other brother of the petitioner

was attempting to enter the house forcibly, one of the inmates of the house has

shot at the person and he has been killed. However, no charges had been framed

against him as it has been determined that he was acting in exercising his right

of private defence on that occasion.

The above facts go on to show that the action of the petitioner is a situation

where it cannot be considered as a mere dispute between the parties, but a

grievous crime. Having considered the facts and the circumstances, it appears

Page 8 of 10

from the sentencing order that the learned Magistrate has been very much

lenient and had well considered the relevant facts and the circumstances and

the mitigatory factors in sentencing the petitioner.

The learned High Court Judge of Hambantota in his well-considered judgement

had found no reason to interfere with the sentencing order of the learned

Magistrate, and had dismissed the challenge to the sentence by the petitioner.

The petitioner has come before this Court invoking the discretionary remedy of

revision of this Court. The discretionary remedy of revision is available to a

person only on exceptional circumstances.

It was held in the case of hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd. Vs. Mercantile Hotels

Management Ltd (1987) 1 SLR 5 that,

It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the appellate

Court is confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist

warranting its intervention.

In the case of Wijesinghe Vs. Thamararatnam (Sriskantha Law Report Vol. IV

page 47) that,

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the

application discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of the

Court.

In the case of Vanik Incorporation Ltd. Vs. Jayasekare (1997) 2 SLR 365 it

was observed,

Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has

occasioned due to a fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but only

when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of

justice.

It is also settled law that the exceptional circumstances relied on by a petitioner

in an application of this nature need to be specifically pleaded before the Court.

Page 9 of 10

In paragraph 16 of the petition, the petitioner has pleaded the following grounds

as the exceptional circumstances available to him to get the judgement of the

learned High Court Judge revised.

a. The petitioner is 50 years old and father of 2 daughters who respectively

is of 14 and 10 years of age. The petitioner is the sole breadwinner of

the family and his wife is unemployed.

b. The petitioner is under clinical treatment for a chronic illness in his

spine, which requires constant medical care.

c. Unless the petitioner is imposed a suspended sentence, he will lose his

employment.

d. The alleged offence has taken place more than 23 years ago and the

petitioner was unmarried and was about 27 years of age at that time.

Thereafter, the petitioner has lived a happy and peaceful family life as

a law-abiding citizen and is employed in the government sector as well.

e. The petitioners brother has died in the alleged transaction of events

after being shot by one of the virtual complainants.

It is abundantly clear from the facts considered during the hearing of this

application that the incident where his brother died was of his own making. The

petitioner had been found guilty for causing injuries to his own mother and the

father, and setting fire to the house where they lived, which needs to be viewed

very seriously.

The learned Magistrate who pronounced the sentencing order has well

considered the mitigatory circumstances that were relevant and the factors

mentioned by the petitioner as exceptional circumstances before this Court.

I am unable to agree that any of the circumstances mentioned falls within the

meaning of an exceptional circumstance for the petitioner to succeed in the

application before this Court. I find no reason to accept that the judgement of

the learned Provincial High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the

Southern Province Holden in Hambantota or the sentence by the learned

Page 10 of 10

Magistrate of Hambantota as occasions where miscarriage of justice has

occurred or decisions that shocks the conscience of the Court.

Accordingly, the revision application preferred by the petitioner is dismissed for

want of any merit.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the

Provincial High Court of the Southern Province Holden in Hambantota and to

the Magistrates Court of Hambantota for information and necessary procedural

steps.
