JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General under Sections 54(A) (b) and

54(A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended

by Act No. 13 of 1984 for the Trafficking and Possession respectively of 3.47

grams of Heroin on the 21st of August 2012 in the High Court of Colombo.

The Appellant was found guilty on both counts and at the conclusion of the

trial and the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo has imposed a sentence

of life imprisonment on him on the 21st of March 2019. At the trial the

prosecution had called six witnesses and marked productions P1-14 in

support of their case. The Appellant had given evidence from the witness box

and called his father as defence witness.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent for the matter to be argued in his absence due to the Covid

19 pandemic. During the argument he was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

3 | P a g e

On behalf of the Appellant four Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. Credibility of the First Information.

2. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the prosecution

did not place any evidence with regard to alleged surveillance carried

out by officers in civil clothes that the alleged information given by the

said officers regarding the Appellant which created a reasonable doubt

in the prosecution case.

3. Probability of alleged detection.

4. Has the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider and analyse that

the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the

production alleged to have been recovered from the Appellant was the

production that was analysed by the Government Analyst.

Facts of the case albeit briefly are as follows.

PW1 IP/ Athula Manohara was attached to Pugoda Special Task Force Camp

when this raid was conducted. On the date of the raid, he had received

reliable information from one of his personal informants which he had noted

down in his pocket notebook. According to the information, the Appellant

used to traffic Heroin to Ratmalana, Macdonalds Rajagiriya and

Banadaranayakapura in his three-wheeler bearing No. WP/HY-7641. It was

further informed that if they proceed to Maliban Junction, Ratmalana the

Appellant could be apprehended. Acting on that information a raid was

organized after his senior officers were duly informed. PW1 with 04 police

officers attired in uniform while PW2 with 04 other police officers were in civil

dress. After completing all the formalities, the team set out for the raid from

Pugoda STF Camp. As the vehicle which was used to set out from Pugoda

Camp was not in good condition, the team had proceeded to Gonahena STF

Camp to change the vehicle. At the Gonahena STF Camp, PW1 had directed

PW2, PW5, PW6 and PW8 to proceed to Macdonalds Rajagiriya by public

transport and his team had proceeded to Maliban Junction, Ratmalana in

the vehicle. At about 14:00 hours he had received a call from the informant

4 | P a g e

who had informed that the Appellant was not coming to Ratmalana on that

day, but was going to Macdonalds Rajagiriya area for the same business.

Having passed this information to PW2, PW1 and his team had proceeded to

Rajagiriya MacDonalds and remained there for the raid. At about 15:40

hours, PW2 had informed that the said three-wheeler had come to the colour

light junction indicating to turn towards Rajagiriya. Immediately, he had

directed PW3 who was in uniform to halt the three-wheeler bearing No.

WP/HY-7641. Accordingly, they were able to stop the vehicle in front of

MacDonalds, Rajagiriya. Thereafter, the Appellant was subjected to a body

check and a parcel with brown coloured powder was recovered from his

trouser pocket. As the brown coloured substance reacted for heroin, he was

arrested along with his three-wheeler. A passenger, later who was identified

as the Appellants father was also arrested and brought to the Police Narcotic

Bureau for further investigations. The substance was weighed to about

22.520 grams. After sealing, the production was handed over to Police

Narcotic Bureau under Production No. 134/2012. Thereafter, the production

was sent to the Government Analyst Department for analysis. According to

the Government Analyst Report 3.47 grams of pure Heroin

(Diacetylmorphine) had been detected in the parcel.

The evidence given by PW1 has been properly corroborated by the other

police witnesses called by the prosecution.

After the closure of the prosecution case, the defence was called as the

Learned High Court Judge had observed that the prosecution had presented

a prima facie case against the Appellant and the Appellant had opted to give

evidence from the witness box and had proceeded to call a witness.

In the first ground of appeal the Appellant raised concern regarding the

credibility of the First Information. He further argued that the Learned Trial

Judge had failed to consider the contradictory nature of the evidence

between PW1 and PW4 with regard to the 1st information that was alleged to

have been received and the doubt created by the said evidence.

5 | P a g e

PW1, after receiving the information pertaining to this case had taken down

the same in his pocket notebook immediately. In his evidence at page 62 of

the brief he had confirmed this. The said evidence is re-produced below:

After this information, he had prepared two teams for the raid. One was in

uniform and the other was in civil attire. The uniformed group headed by

PW1 had left for Ratmalana and the other group was sent to Rajagiriya near

MacDonalds for the raid. PW1 had received a call from the informant about

the movement of the Appellant around Rajagiriya area only on that day.

Hence his team also rushed to Rajagiriya near MacDonalds and awaited the

arrival of the Appellant.

PW4, who was in the uniformed team under the command of PW1 had very

clearly corroborated the evidence given by PW1. The relevant portion of the

evidence is re-produced below:

Although, PW1 and PW4 were subjected for a lengthy cross-examination,

their evidence very clearly reflected how the information was received and

the raid conducted. The Learned High Court Judge after proper deliberation

of their evidence, concluded that the evidence given by PW1 and PW4 is clear,

consistent and unambiguous. Therefore, accepted them as truthful

witnesses. As the credibility of the information had not been shaken in the

trial, the Appellant is not successful in his first ground of appeal.

In the second ground of appeal, the Learned Presidents Counsel contended

that the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the prosecution

did not place any evidence with regard to the alleged surveillance carried out

by officers in civil clothes.

From the very inception, PW1 had given consistent evidence as to how he

planned the raid. No ambiguity or inconsistency was highlighted either in

his evidence or from PW4. Planning and the execution of the raid was entirely

dependent on the prerogative of the officers who participated in the raid.

Presence of civil clothes officers at the place of arrest was considered by the

Learned High Court Judge in his judgment. At paragraph 12.0 and 13.0 the

Learned High Court Judge has stated as follows:

(Pages 275-276 of the brief.)

8 | P a g e

Hence it is incorrect to argue that evidence pertaining to the presence of civil

clothes officers at the place of arrest has escaped the consideration of the

Learned High Court. Therefore, this ground also has lacks any merit.

In the third ground of appeal, the Learned Presidents Counsel contends that

the probability of the version of the police officers create a reasonable doubt

as happening of some events were highly improbable.

As stated above, planning and execution are entirely on the prerogative of

the officer who heads the raid. All decisions have to be taken accordingly, to

suit the situation. Hence it is not highly improbable for officers travelling in

an unmarked vehicle on the same route not accompanying officers in civil

clothes to travel in the same vehicle up to a certain point.

PW1, in his evidence very clearly stated how he meticulously planned the

raid. One group travelling in a vehicle and the other using public transport

are the strategies which had been adopted by the raiding team. Not travelling

in one vehicle nor taking different routes to reach their targets cannot be

considered unusual in a police raid. This ground of appeal is also sans any

merit as the actual happening of the raid is not doubtful.

In the final ground of appeal, the Learned Presidents Counsel contended

that the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider and analyse that the

prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the production

alleged to have been recovered from the Appellant was the production that

was analysed by the Government Analyst.

In several judicial decisions delivered both by the Apex Court and the Court

of Appeal of our jurisdiction, one salient point stressed frequently is that the

inward journey of the productions in drugs related cases plays a decisive role

in the final outcome of the matter. If the inward journey evidence creates a

doubt, the failure of the prosecution case is inevitable. Hence, the chain of

the inward journey of the production plays a major role in matters related to

9 | P a g e

drugs. The inward journey begins with the detection, sealing, custody and

the conclusion by reaching the Government Analyst Department.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person. In a case of this nature

the prosecution does not only need to prove the case beyond reasonable

doubt but also ensure, with cogent evidence that the inward journey of the

production has not been disturbed at the all-material point.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 the court

held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences relation to drugs, we are of

the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions where the identity of the

good analysis for examination has to be proved beyond reasonable

doubt. A prosecutor should take pains to ensure that the chain of

events pertaining to the productions that had been taken charge from

the Appellant from the time it was taken into custody to the time it

reaches the Government Analyst and comes back to the court should

be established.

According to PW1, the detection was done upon an information received

beforehand. The Heroin was recovered from the left side pocket of the pair of

shorts worn by the Appellant. After recovering the substance, the Appellant

was taken to the Police Narcotic Bureau for further investigations. Until such

time the production was in the custody of PW1. After arriving at the Police

Narcotic Bureau, the substance was weighed using an electronic scale. The

total weight including the grocery cover showed a weight of 22.520 grams.

The weighing and sealing were done in front of the Appellant. PW1 had used

his personal seal to seal the production and also obtained the fingerprint of

the Appellant to seal the production. The sealed productions were handed

10 | P a g e

over to the reserve police officer Sgt/27632 Nalin of Police Narcotic Bureau

after marking as PR 134/2012. The three-wheeler No. WP/HY-7641 which

was driven by the Appellant at the time of his arrest was also handed over

after marking as PR 135/12.

The Appellant was produced before the Learned Magistrate of Maligakanda.

The production was taken to the Government Analyst Department by PW10

IP/Rajakaruna of Police Narcotic Bureau on 24/08/2012.

The prosecution led evidence that production PR 134/2012 was duly kept

under the care of reserve police officers until it reached the Government

Analyst Department. All reserve officers were called to give evidence to

confirm that the production pertaining to this case had reached the

Government Analyst Department without any break in the chain of custody.

PW11, the Assistant Government Analyst, Vajira Jayasekera confirmed that

the production pertaining to this case had reached her department with all

seals intact.

The Learned Presidents Counsel contended that although PW10 had

received a sealed envelope which he had handed over to the Government

Analyst Deportment on 24/08/2012, but in her evidence PW11, the

Assistant Government Analyst testified that the Government Analyst

Department had received two sealed parcels from Police Narcotics Bureau.

Although PW11 in her evidence at page 164 answered that two sealed

envelopes had been received by the Government Analyst Department, the

receipt which had been marked as P14 through this witness clearly

mentioned that only one parcel had been received by the Government

Analyst. This is further confirmed in the Government Analyst Report

prepared and submitted by PW11. Hence, it is very clear that the

Government Analyst Department had only received one sealed envelope for

analysis. Handing over and receival of the production by the Government

11 | P a g e

Analyst had been considered by the Learned High court Judge in the

judgment.

The Learned Presidents Counsel further argued that there was a difference

in the weight mentioned on the envelope and the recording of the weight by

the Government Analyst Department.

According to PW11, on the top of the envelope which had been received by

the Government Analyst Department the weight of the substance had been

mentioned as 22.520 grams. But the weighing result of the Government

Analyst showed 23.02 grams. The Learned Presidents Counsel for the

Appellant argues that this discrepancy is a substantial fact that which

certainly affects the outcome of the case. As the difference of weight is only

about 500 milligrams excess compared to the weight mentioned by the Police

Narcotics Bureau, I dont think this difference could create a vacuum in the

prosecution case. Further, the defence had not put a single question to PW11

when she gave evidence in the High Court regarding the weight difference.

The Learned High Court had very clearly considered this weight issue and

come to a correct finding. The relevant portion of the judgment is re-

produced below:

Next the Learned Presidents Counsel pointed out the difference in the

number of seals as stated by PW1 and PW11 when they gave evidence.

According to PW1, he had placed seven seals on the parcels which had been

sent to the Government Analyst for analysis. Although PW11, the Assistant

Government Analyst initially said that she had noticed six seals on the parcel

but when she identified the production in open court admitted that 07 seals

were on the parcel. The relevant portion of her evidence is re-produced below:

In this regard the Learned High Court Judge, in his judgment, had correctly

pointed out that the defence had failed to put relevant questions to the

witnesses who gave evidence regarding the production of the case. Hence, it

is quite clear that the learned High Court Judge had correctly considered

evidence pertaining to the chain of production in its correct perspective.

Hence, this ground also has no merit.

In this case evidence pertaining to the detection of Heroin from the Appellant

is clear, cogent and without any contradiction or omission. The evidence

presented by the prosecution is not challenged at any material point. Hence

no fault had occurred at any stage of the trial.

13 | P a g e

The Learned High Court Judge had accurately analysed and considered the

evidence presented by both parties and arrived at a proper finding.

Considering all the evidence presented during the trial, I conclude that the

prosecution has proven the case beyond reasonable doubt. I further conclude

that this is not an appropriate case in which to interfere with the decision of

the Learned High Court judge of Colombo dated 21/03/2019.

Hence, the appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
