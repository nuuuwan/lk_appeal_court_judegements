As per the said judgment, the Petitioner has been granted only a limited right to possess the relevant premises to the extent of the value of the improvements made to the property. Further, the occupation under document A3 is prone to disturbance (contrary to Rule 13(b)) as the Petitioner has only the right of Jus Retentionis which means that they only have the right to retain the property until the value of any improvements made is settled.
