The petitioner shipped through a company in Bangkok to the 5th respondent 45,000 bags of sugar, equivalent to 2,250 metric tons in terms of the said contracts. A copy of the BL is produced marked P6. At the time of shipping the said goods of the petitioner, the remitting bank, namely United Overseas Bank of Singapore, forwarded the original documents, namely the original Bill of Lading, Commercial Invoice for US$ 1,440,000/- and Notice of Bill Exchange for US$ 1,440,000/- to Seylan Bank the 6th respondent, the collecting Bank in Sri Lanka. Copies of the said documents marked P7(a), P7(b) and P7(c) were produced. The petitioner has shipped another consignment of sugar consisting of 15000 bags, equivalent to 750 metric tons in terms of the above contract. A copy of BL No. BKKCB 12013942 is produced marked P9. The United Overseas Bank, acting as the remitting bank in Singapore, forwarded the original documents, namely, On Board Bill of Lading, Commercial Invoice for US$ 480,000/- and Bill of Exchange for US$ 480,000/-, to the Seylan Bank. Copies of those documents were produced by the petitioner marked P10(a), P10(b) and P10(c). K. Gnanasekaran, in collusion with an employee of the Seylan Bank (Eranga Ratnayake), removed one set of original BLs and other relevant documents which were sent by the petitioner and replaced them with coloured photocopies of the same. Without making any payments to the Seylan Bank, K. Gnanasekaran and Daisang obtained the goods from the shipping company. They paid customs duties to the customs and released the sugar. At that time, Seylan Bank was under the impression that the original BL and all other documents were with the Bank. As the remitting bank in Singapore was not paid, it made inquiries from Seylan Bank as to why the payments were delayed. The Seylan Bank replied that the customer had not yet made payment and obtained the documents. The petitioner made inquiries from Delmege Forsyth & Company (Shipping) Limited and the shipping company, by documents marked P13 dated 03/10/2012, informed the petitioner that the original Delivery Order had been collected from the shipping agent upon submitting the original BL and other documents. Thereafter, on 03/10/2012, one of the Directors of the petitioner came to Sri Lanka and made a complaint at the Criminal Investigation Dept. (CID) regarding the above matter. The CID thereupon took steps to raid the warehouse where the said sugar had been stored. As the said goods, which were stored in the warehouse, had by then been detained by Sri Lanka Customs, the CID refrained from",

The buyer is required to make payment to the collecting bank to have the BL and other related documents for the purpose of clearing the goods. In the present matter, Daisang International was to make payment to the Seylan Bank in order to receive the BLs and other documents to clear the goods. However, Gnanasekaran, with the assistance of the bank assistant at the Seylan Bank branch in Grandpass named Eranga Ratnayake, stealthily removed the original BLs and replaced them with a similar coloured copy of BLs. Gnanasekaran got the consignments of sugar cleared by using these illegally removed documents. The respondents have submitted in their written submission that both counsel for the petitioners in the two Writ Applications unequivocally admitted that Gnanasekaran, Krishnan and Eranga had perpetrated fraud to obtain documents and get the consignment of sugar released. The respondent submitted that hence, the fraud having been committed, be admitted by all parties and thus undisputed. Thus, the question that remains to be answered by Court is whether the confiscation was lawful and justifiable when a fraud is committed and when the parties have unequivocally admitted that they have committed such fraud.

As per contract P4 and in terms of the provisions of the Sales of Goods Ordinance, the title in sugar consignment is with the petitioner until he receives the sale price. In CIF contracts, the property passes with the transfer of the Bill of Lading. In this matter, Gnanasekaran, with the assistance of Eranga Ratnayake, dishonestly acquired the delivery order and illegally affixed the bank seal. A Stolen Bill of Lading cannot pass the title to the holder. Professor Michael Furmstons Principle of Commercial Law 2nd Edition, page 50 explains the retention of title clause as follows: It is very likely that a seller who employs standard conditions of sale and normally gives a customer credit will wish to provide that property does not pass simply on delivery but only at some later stage such as when payment is made. The petitioner has taken steps to send the original Bills of Lading and other documents through a remitting bank in Singapore to the Seylan Bank in Sri Lanka. The payment method agreed upon was DP terms. Since the price of the goods was not paid to the petitioner, the title of the sugar consignment in question is still with the petitioner.
