The Petitionerin this Application is seeking mandates in the nature of a

Writ ofCertiorari quashing the succession granted to the 3rd Respondent

inrelationto a Grantbearing numberpo/pra/10255and Writof

Mandamus granting the succession to the Petitioner.

In analyzing the material facts at hand, one Ranasinghe Arachchilage

Hendrick Ranasinghe (hereinafter referred to as Ranasinghe) ,father of

the Petitionerand the 3rd Respondent, in terms of the provisions of the

Land Development Ordinance No 19 of 1935(as amended) obtained a

Permit bearing no. 1205, marked as P1, in respect of the land described as

2

lot 330 in final colony plan No. 47 to the extent of land 02A 02R12P in

Hingurakoda 70E Thabalaweva, on 12th January 1967.

The said Permitholderhad nominated the 3rd Respondentas his

successor.Thereafter, a Grant bearing numberpo/ pra/ 10255dated

30.05.1986under and in terms of Section 19(4) of the Land Development

Ordinancewas granted to thesaid Ranasinghepertaining to the same

land (marked as P1) which was then subsequently registered on 15.08.

1988 at the land registry, which is marked as P2.

Subsequent to the death of the said Ranasinghe on the 22. 10. 1988 the

widow, Emalin nona, succeeded as life interest holder which was registered

on 15.01.1988 and subsequently died on 4.9.2007.

Prior to this Application being instituted in this Court, action bearing

number 1364/L was instituted in the District Court of Polonnaruwa by the

3rd Respondentto eject one Abeyrathne who was cultivating on the said

land. However the Court decided that the 3rd Respondent was not entitled

to succeed to the Grant in terms of the provisions of the Land Development

Ordinance.The 3rd Respondent, appealing to the Provincial High Court

(Civil Appellate) Anuradhapura, had the judgment of the District Court set

aside.

Thereafter, the 2nd Respondent Divisional Secretary Hingurakgoda after an

inquiry decided that the Petitioner is legally entitled to succeed to the said

Grantandcommunicatedthedecisionon25.6.2018(marked"P6").

Accordingly, the name of the Petitioner had been registered in the relevant

Register on 26.6.2018 (marked "P7"). Subsequently the Petitioner received a

letter dated 24.8.2018 marked "P8" from the 1st Respondent Commissioner

of Lands that the Register has been amended. The Petitioner obtaining

certified copies of the relevant folio from the Land Registry discovered that

the Grant has been registered in the name of the 3rd Respondent.

3

The Petitioner argues that he is entitled to the land as he is the eldest son of

the original Grantee Under section 72 of the Land Development Ordinance

as amended by Section 68(2)(ii)of the Land Development Ordinance as

amended by Act, No 16 of 1969 and Act, No 27 of 1981.

In this regard, I refer to the observation made by the Supreme Court in the

caseofMalleheVidaneralalageDonAgosinnoVs.Divisional

Secretary-Thamankaduv 1 where His Lordship the Chief Justice S.N. Silva

enunciated that;

it is clear from the provisions of the law that the change in the nature

of the holding from that of a permit to a Grant is one purpose and it

should not be taken as two distinct processes for the purpose of

annulling a nomination that has been previously made.

In the case of Piyasena Vs. Wijesinghe 2 the Court of Appeal observed that;

The nomination in the Permit itself shall stand valid until it is

subsequently cancelled by the Permit Holder. The nomination of a

successor under the Permit becomes converted to nomination made by

the permit holder as the owner of the land.

Furthermore it was observed in this court in Paranavitharana Karunapala

Vs Minister of Lands and others3 that

the nomination of a successor made by the Permit holder in his Permit

is valid until the same is revoked. However, if the Permit holder has

made a fresh nomination in his Grant which has been given to him

subsequent to the said Permit in respect of the same land, the original

nomination made by him in the Permit becomes invalid, and the fresh

nomination is deemed to be valid. In the absence of a fresh nomination

in the subsequent Grant, the nomination made by the Permit holder in

his Permit will be considered as a valid nomination to the Grant as the

nomination flows from the Permit to the Grant.

In light of the aforementioned judicial pronouncements and the provisions

oftheLandDevelopmentOrdinance,Ihold thatthe nomination of

succession made by the Permit Holder, Ranasinghe, in the Permit, to the

3rd Respondent extends its validity to the Grant as well. Consequently,

under these circumstances, the decision rendered by the 1st Respondent to

effectuate the transfer of the aforementioned Grant to the 3rd Respondent is

deemed to be valid.

Application dismissed. No costs.
