I now advert to this contention. The learned trial Judge at page 177 of this Judgement, rejected the defense of the accused on the basis that it had not been proved. I shall now consider whether the above conclusion reached by the learned trial Judge is right or wrong. In considering this question I am guided by certain judicial decisions. In Ariyadasa Vs. Queen 68 N.L.R. page 66 Justice Fernando held thus: where in a prosecution for murder the accused gives evidence without seeking to bring himself within the benefit of a general or special exception in the Penal Code, the burden of proof does not shift on to him at any stage.",

    "text": "In Martin Singho Vs. Queen 69 C.L.W. at page 22 Justice T.S. Fernando remarked thus: As this Court has pointed out on many occasions in the past, where an accused person is not relying on a general or special exception contained in the Penal Code, there is no burden on him to establish any fact. Applying the principles laid down in the above judicial decisions, I hold that when an accused person denies the incident, there is no burden on the accused to prove any fact. In such an event the burden of proof does not shift on to the accused. It is clear from the above conclusion of the learned trial Judge; the learned trial Judge has shifted the burden on the accused to prove his defense namely the denial. The learned trial Judge, by the said conclusion, ignored the presumption of innocence. In short, the learned trial Judge, by the said conclusion, decided that the accused should prove his innocence. This becomes so since the accused denied the incident of the murder. The above conclusion of the learned trial Judge is a serious misdirection on law, which cannot be ignored or overlooked by applying the provisos the Article 138 of the Constitution and Section 334 of the Criminal Procedure Code.",
