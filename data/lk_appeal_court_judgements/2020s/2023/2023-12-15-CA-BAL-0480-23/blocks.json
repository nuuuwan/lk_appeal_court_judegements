The petitioner was arrested on 13.11.2022 for allegedly being in possession of 1,626 grams of heroin. The Government Analyst report has not been filed of record. However, the respondents have submitted that, as per the Government Analyst report, the pure quantity of heroin was 840 grams. The petitioner states that the suspect was arrested at his residence and he was subjected to physical assault and torture by the officers of the police Narcotic Bureau. The petitioner further states that the 1st suspect denied the allegation against the 1st suspect. He further pleads that no legal substance was recovered from the suspect's possession and he had never been involved in drug trafficking. The petitioner further states that the legal substance was introduced to the 1st suspect at a later time. The petitioner has filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka. An Attorney-at-law who appeared on behalf of the 1st suspect in Hambantota informed the Court about the unlawful conduct of the officers of the Police Narcotic Bureau. The respondents have filed objections to the petitioners application. The respondents have denied the allegations made in the petition. Further, the respondent stated that when the 1st suspect was first produced before the Magistrates Court, no complaint was made regarding the assault. The allegation of assault was made after a period of nearly three months.",
