ARGUED ON : 01.03.2023

DECIDED ON : 03.05.2023

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. The petitioner company filed this application seeking a writ of certiorari

to quash the order of the Commissioner General of Labour dated

18.01.2019 marked P-10, wherein the petitioner was ordered to pay a

compensation of Rs.12,889,819.50 to the 4th to 15th respondents in lieu

of terminating their employment. In addition, the petitioner has sought

a writ of certiorari to quash the application of the compensation formula

contained in Extraordinary Gazette No. 1384/07, dated 15.03.2005 in

calculating the compensation in relation to this order.

The statements of objections have been filed on behalf of the

respondents and subsequently, the counter affidavit was also filed. This

application has been argued before another bench of this court

previously. At the request of all parties, the application was re-argued.

At the hearing, the learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner, the

learned state counsel for the 1st to 3rd respondents, and the learned

counsel for the 4th to 15th respondents made oral submissions.

4

The petitioner is a private limited liability company engaged in the

business inter alia, of import/export trading, repacking/distribution of

agrochemicals, import and distribution of medical equipment. The

National Development Bank auctioned a petitioner's property in Ekala

under parate execution due to the petitioner's failure to repay a loan.

Following that, the petitioner sent a letter captioned "Cessation of

Employment" to its employees on August 31, 2016, explaining the

difficulty in carrying on with their business. The petitioner paid gratuity

and three months salary as an ex-gratia payment to all employees. The

4th to 15th respondents, who were members of the 16th respondent

union, were dissatisfied with the petitioner's decision and filed

applications before the Commissioner General of Labour under the

Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act No. 45

of 1971 seeking relief for unfair termination of their employment. After

holding an inquiry, the Commissioner General of Labour, the 2nd

respondent, awarded the aforesaid compensation to the 4th to 15th

respondents. Being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner filed this

writ application.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner advanced the

following three main arguments.

i. There is a failure to consider the preliminary jurisdictional

objection raised at the beginning of the inquiry that the

Commissioner General of Labor is devoid of jurisdiction under

the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special

Provisions) Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act) because

the contracts of employment were frustrated as the petitioner

could not carry on the business.

ii. The order dated 18.01.2019 is vitiated in law as there is a

failure to give reasons for the order.

5

iii. The said order is in breach of natural justice in that, in

awarding a sum of Rs.12,889,819.50 to the workmen as

compensation, it has disregarded the evidence that the

petitioner had suffered severe economic hardship and was

unable to meet its financial obligations.

The learned state counsel for the 1st to 3rd respondents contended that

due to the failure to pay the loan obtained by the petitioner, the property

of the petitioner was auctioned under parate execution, and it is a

foreseeable and not unforeseeable circumstance and thus there was no

frustration. The learned state counsel also contended that the

petitioner's process of placing the property in a situation of acquisition

by the bank due to non-payment of the loan and thus making it

impossible to continue the services of the employees is tantamount to

a termination of employment. Further, the learned state counsel

contended that the case at hand is distinguished from the case of

Sachithanandan V. Gnanum - C.A. No. 476/86 Court of Appeal

Minutes, 18.08.1993, because in that case, a frustrating event occurred

due to unforeseen circumstances.

While agreeing with the contentions of the learned state counsel for the

1st to 3rd respondents, the learned counsel for the 4th to 15th

respondents contended that the petitioners property had to be acquired

by the bank due to their financial mismanagement and failure to pay

the loan and that this situation could have been prevented by the

petitioner. As it is not an unforeseeable circumstance, the learned

counsel contended further that there was no frustration of contracts

and that terminating the employment of the 4th to 15th respondents is

illegal.

6

According to Section 2 of the Act, no employer shall terminate the

scheduled employment of any workman without the prior consent in

writing of the workman or the prior written approval of the

Commissioner of Labour. Undisputedly, the 4th to 15th respondents

were scheduled employees, and their services have been terminated

without the prior written consent of them or prior written approval of

the Commissioner of Labour.

The contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner was

that the petitioner did not terminate their employment. He contended

that the Act does not apply in this case because the petitioner was

unable to meet its financial obligations as a result of the severe

economic hardships, and as a result, the petitioner company became

non-operational and could not carry on with their business. Therefore,

the learned Presidents Counsel contended that as the petitioners

property was auctioned by the bank, they could not continue their

business, and the contracts of employment were frustrated due to the

impossibility of performance. Hence, there was a cessation of

employment with effect from 31.08.2016, and there was no termination

of employment, he contended.

In addition, the learned President's Counsel contended that, despite the

petitioner's inability to conduct business, the petitioner offered its

employees three months' salary as an ex-gratia payment, as well as

gratuity. He contended further that the 4th to 15th respondents also

accepted the gratuity and they accepted the same as a terminal benefit,

and thus, now they cannot challenge the termination of employment.

The learned President's Counsel submitted that in the impugned order,

the Commissioner General has not considered any of these issues.

It should be noted that accepting gratuity offered by the employer in the

termination of employment does not preclude the employees from

7

claiming their legal entitlements. Although the learned presidents

Counsel attempted to formulate an argument that accepting gratuity

amounts to consenting to the termination, I regret that I am unable to

agree with that argument because Section 2 of the Act specifically states

that the prior consent in writing of the workman should be obtained in

terminating the employment. The 4th to 15th respondents have never

given their prior consent in writing, and their employment were

terminated without the prior written consent of any of the employees or

the prior written approval of the Commissioner of Labour.

The central argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioner was that there was a frustration of contract, so, Section 2 of

the Act does not apply and the Commissioner General of Labour has no

jurisdiction to make the order dated 18.01.2019. Citing the judgment

of Magpack Exports Limited v. Commissioner of Labour and Others

- (2000) 2 Sri L.R 308, the learned Presidents Counsel contended that

in this case, the petitioner company closed the establishment even

without informing the workers, but in the instant case, the petitioner

sent the letter dated 31.08.2016 to all employees and informed them

that there was a frustration of the contract due to the impossibility of

performance.

If the petitioner terminates the employment of its workmen, the

termination must be done in accordance with Section 2 of the Act. The

argument of the learned Presidents Counsel is that Section 2 of the Act

does not apply because there was no termination of employment. The

petitioners position was that as a result of the frustration, contracts of

employment were ceased by operation of law. Hence, the main issue to

be determined in this case is whether the acquisition of the petitioners

property by the bank in accordance with the provisions of the law

results in the frustration of contracts of employment.

8

A contract may come to an end due to its frustration or due to the

impossibility of performance. Frustration refers to a situation where an

unforeseen event occurs after a contract has been formed. The doctrine

of frustration is based on the principle that a contract should be

performed as agreed by the parties, but that there may be

circumstances beyond the control of the parties that make it impossible

or impractical to do so.

The issue of whether there was a frustration could be made clearer by

perusing the relevant judicial authorities. In Satchithanandan V.

Ghanum - C.A No. 476/86: C.A.M 18.08.1993 an employee claimed

reinstatement and back wages as relief for the termination of his

services, where the employers industries and head office had been

destroyed by ethnic violence. The Court of Appeal held that there was

no termination of the workmans services by the employer as the

contract had come to an end through the operation of law by a

frustrating event for which neither party was responsible. This is a clear

case of frustration of contract. Neither party was responsible for the

totally unexpected ethnic violence. The industry could not be continued

because the industry and head office of the employer had been

destroyed as a result of ethnic violence. It is apparent that the employer

had no way of knowing about the unexpected ethnic violence. The case

at hand is entirely different. The employer (petitioner) knew very well

even at the stage of obtaining the loan that its properties would be

acquired by the bank under parate execution if the loan was not paid.

The party that foresees the event is not entitled to plead frustration as

decided in Magpeck Exports case.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner contended that there

is a difference between Magpack Exports Limited v. Commissioner

of Labour and Others and the case at hand. It is correct that in the

Magpeck Exports case, the company was closed without informing the

workers, but in the case at hand, the petitioner had informed all

9

employees by letter dated 31st, August 2016 about the cessation of

employment. The petitioner has stated in the said letter that There is

a frustration of your contract due to impossibility of performance.

Because of the reason that the petitioner mentioned about a frustration

in that letter, it cannot be concluded that the contracts of employment

were ceased due to frustration. Acquiring the petitioners property by

the bank due to non-payment of the loan is not an unforeseen

circumstance; and thus, there was no frustration.

Citing the decision of Ceylon Mercantile Union V. De Mel - 76 N.L.R.

390 the learned Presidents Counsel contended that the Act has no

application to a situation where a contract of service terminates by

operation of law or by some act on the part of the workman. In the said

case, the petitioner has admitted that the employees went on strike on

3rd February 1972 in connection with a dispute concerning the

termination of the services of the President of the Times of Ceylon

Branch of the petitioner Union. It was held that employees in an

"essential service" who are deemed to have vacated their employment

by virtue of the operation of the Emergency Regulations read with the

Essential Services Order 1972 made thereunder are not entitled, when

their employer refuses to offer them work thereafter, to seek re-

employment through the intervention of the Commissioner of Labour

under section 6 of the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special

Provisions) Act, No. 45 of 1971.

Again, the case at hand is entirely different from the aforesaid case. It

is precisely clear that in the instant case, the 4th to 15th respondents

lost their employment due to no fault of them or no fault of any other

employee. It is also clear that the contracts of employment came to an

end, not by operation of law. Contracts had to be terminated because

the petitioner failed to repay the loan obtained, in consequence, the

bank acquired the petitioners property and as a result, the petitioner

could not carry on the business.

10

In the case of Walton Harvey Ltd v Walker & Homfrays Ltd

[1931] 1 Ch 274, a hotel owner entered into a contract with an

advertising agency enabling them to put illuminated adverts on the roof

of their hotel. The hotel was then compulsorily purchased by the Local

Authority and demolished. The advertising agency sued for breach of

contract and the hotel argued the contract had become frustrated. It

was held that the contract was not frustrated as the hotel owners were

aware that the Local Authority was looking to purchase the hotel at the

time, they entered the contract. They should have foreseen the fact that

this could happen in the lifetime of the contract and made provision in

the contract for such an eventuality. They were therefore liable to pay

damages for breach of contract.

When considering the case at hand, it is clear that the petitioner was

well aware that its properties would be acquired through parate

execution if the loan obtained from the bank was not paid. Hence,

acquiring the petitioner's property due to nonpayment of the loan was

not an unforeseen event. Furthermore, paying the loan was entirely

within the control of the petitioner and was not beyond the control of

the petitioner. If the loan obtained by the petitioner had been paid as

agreed, nothing would have happened beyond the control of the

petitioner. When the bank proceeds to adopt its legal entitlement of

parate execution to acquire the property in default of payment, an

attempt to prevent the auction by instituting legal proceedings cannot

be considered as a satisfactory and practical measure taken to prevent

the termination of services of the employees. It was because of the

petitioners own failure that the bank was compelled to acquire the

petitioners property. The most successful and sure way of avoiding the

acquisition of the property would have been to manage the company's

financial situation efficiently while keeping in mind that they must pay

the bank loan on time. Therefore, it is clearly a foreseen circumstance.

Hence, I regret that I am unable to agree with the contention of the

learned Presidents Counsel that there was a frustration of contracts.

11

The doctrine of frustration could not be applied here for the reasons

stated above, and thus I hold that this is not a cessation of employment

as captioned in the letter P7(b), but termination of employment of the

respondents 4 to 15 by the petitioner. As the termination of employment

is not in accordance with Section 2 of the Act, I hold further that it is

an unlawful termination of employment. In the circumstances, the

petitioner company is liable to pay compensation to the 4th to 15th

respondents as correctly determined by the commissioner of labour in

a situation where reinstatement was not possible.

The learned Presidents Counsel submitted that the appellant company

is presently located in a smaller place as compared to its previous place

of business. Yet, the fact remains that the company is still in existence

and has not been wound up. If the company has reached a point where

it can no longer continue with its affairs, the company itself or its

creditors could have instituted winding up proceedings. The fact that

the petitioner company did not take such a step indicates that the

company was in a viable state.

At this juncture, I wish to consider another main argument of the

learned Presidents Counsel that the preliminary jurisdictional

objection had not been considered by the Commissioner General.

Without making an order regarding the jurisdictional objection, the

Commissioner General has determined the matter on the basis that the

petitioner has terminated the employment of the 4th to 15th

respondents. The Commissioner General would not have jurisdiction to

hear this matter only if the contracts of employment were ceased by

operation of law. Already, this Court has decided that it was not a

frustration of contracts of employment but a termination of

employment. Therefore, the Commissioner General has jurisdiction to

hear and determine this matter. In the circumstances, although there

was no order regarding the jurisdictional objection, no prejudice would

12

be caused to the petitioner and no illegality would occur because

determining the matter on the basis that the petitioner has terminated

the employments of the 4th to 15th respondents is correct.

The learned President's Counsel for the petitioner also contended, citing

some judicial authorities, that the order dated 18.01.2019, which has

no reasons, should be quashed. He claimed that the document R3A,

which was tendered with counter-objections, was a private secret

document among them and that it was not shown to the petitioner until

it was tendered in Court. Document R3 tendered with the statement of

objections is an inquiry report and recommendations of the inquiring

officer submitted through the Deputy Commissioner of Labour to the

Labour Commissioner. In the said report, the reasons for the

recommendations are stated in detail. Although the document R3 has

not been provided to the petitioner, other than the absence of an order

regarding the jurisdictional objection, reasons for the order dated

18.02.2019 have been provided under the subtopic of " " on the last

page of the order, and the basis for computing the compensation has

also been stated. It is my view that those reasons are sufficient for the

petitioner to understand the said order. It has already been stated that

the failure to issue an order regarding the jurisdictional objection has

caused neither prejudice to the petitioner nor illegality. Therefore, this

is a reasoned order.

The issues that remain for consideration are whether the order is in

breach of natural justice by not considering the fact that the petitioner

was facing severe economic hardship and was unable to meet his

financial obligations and the argument that the formula for

compensation as contained in Gazette Extraordinary No.1384/07 dated

15.03.2005 should not be applied in calculating compensation in this

case.

13

It should be noted that if a person or company obtains a loan, it is their

responsibility to repay it. There could be several reasons for

their financial difficulties. The learned counsel for the 4th to 15th

respondents submitted that the said situation arose as a result of

economic mismanagement. Whatever the case may be, the 4th to 15th

respondents or other employees were not liable for the petitioners

economic hardships. The employees should not suffer the

consequences of taking over the property by the bank because of the

failure of the petitioner company to fulfill its financial obligations to the

bank. Hence, the 4th to 15th respondents must be compensated, as their

services were terminated by the petitioner illegally.

With regard to the issue of applying Gazette Extraordinary No.1384/07

dated 15.03.2005 in calculating compensation, the learned President's

Counsel contended that the Gazette is not a part of the Act and that

only the provisions of the Act, constitute the law and thus, it is not

essential to adopt the formula set out in the gazette. However, the Act

empowers Gazetting. The Commissioner General of Labour has not

awarded compensation arbitrarily. The necessity of having a formula in

awarding compensation was dealt with in the case of St. Judes

Industries Ltd. and Another V. Commissioner General of Labour

and 43 Others C.A (Writ) Application No.138/2008 decided on

14.09.2012. It was held in the said case that at different times by

different commissioners of labour, compensations were awarded in an

arbitrary manner. Taking these matters into consideration, the legislature

has thought it fit to amend the law and to have a compensation formula

formulated so that a uniform compensation formula will apply to all

situations where compensation is awarded to the workmen in the event

of the workmans services are terminated in violation of the provisions of

the law. Therefore, the commissioner at present has no option but when

he decides that the termination of the employment of the employees are

in contravention of the provisions of the Termination of Employment of

Workmen (Special Provisions) Act, the 1st respondent has to apply the

14

formula with regard to compensation and therefore, the petitioners

cannot challenge the said decision of the commissioner to apply the

formula and to award compensation. I entirely agree with the aforesaid

decision and I am of the view that the formula outlined in the Gazette

would be the most reasonable method of awarding compensation in the

instant case as well. Hence, I hold that there was no violation of the

rules of natural justice and that it was correct in applying the formula

as contained in Gazette Extraordinary No.1384/07 dated 15.03.2005

in computing compensation for the 4th to 15th respondents.

For the reasons stated above, I find no reasons to interfere with the

order dated 18.01.2019. Accordingly, the application for writs is

dismissed without costs.
