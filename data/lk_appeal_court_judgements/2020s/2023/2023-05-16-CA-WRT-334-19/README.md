DECIDED ON : 16.05.2023

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The petitioners filed this application seeking a writ of mandamus

directing the 1st Respondent, Secretary of the Ministry of

Education to take over the management of the Wellassa Subhagya

Special School. The petitioners have also sought a writ of

prohibition, restraining the 8th to 18th Respondents from

continuing as office bearers or members of the Special Education

Development Society of the Wellassa Subhagya Special School. In

addition, petitioners have sought a writ of mandamus directing

the 1st, 4th, 6th, and 7th Respondents to initiate legal actions

against the 8th to 18th respondents on the misconduct,

mismanagement, fraud, and financial corruption based on the

reports marked P-6 and P-8.

According to Section 62 of the Education Ordinance, an "Assisted

School" is defined as a school to which aid is contributed from State

funds.

The statements of objections were filed on behalf of the

respondents and subsequently, counter objections were also filed.

The parties have agreed to dispose the matter by way of written

submissions without oral submissions. Accordingly, written

6

submissions were filed on behalf of petitioners, the 1st to 7th and

19th respondents, and the 8th to 18th respondents.

Background of the Case

The petitioners in this matter are the parents of five children who

are students and residents of the Wellassa Subhagya Special

School, an institution established to cater to the educational

needs of children with vision, hearing, and mental impairments.

Wellassa Subhagya Special School is an assisted school within

the meaning of the Education Ordinance No. 31 of 1939. The

school is governed by a society, namely the "Special Education

Development Services Society," whose committee is comprised of

the 8th to 18th respondents.

The petitioners position is that due to the alleged misconduct,

mismanagement, and failure on the part of the management of

the society to ensure the safety and welfare of the children, the

lives of all students at the school have been put in danger. To

substantiate their allegations of malpractices and financial

mismanagement, reports P-6, P-7, and P-8 have been submitted

with the petition. Based on the aforementioned concerns, the

petitioners have filed this application.

On behalf of the 1st to 7th and 19th respondents, it has been

submitted that the petitioners cannot maintain the instant

application for the following reasons.

a) The petitioners have failed to establish before this court that

the instant application satisfies the conditions to be met for

a writ of mandamus;

b) The petitioners cannot demand a performance of duty that

the said respondents are not permitted by law;

7

c) The petitioners cannot seek to compel the respondents to

act in contravention of the order of this Court in

CA/WRIT/173/2015;

d) The 1st to 7th Respondents have not been named in their

person and a writ of mandamus cannot lie against the

same;

e) The Application and the reliefs prayed for are patently

misconceived in law;

f) The Petitioners are guilty of laches.

The main contention on behalf of the 8th to 18th respondents was

also that the writ of mandamus prayed for by the petitioners in

prayer (b) to the amended petition cannot be granted inasmuch

as there is no statutory provision in the Education Ordinance or

any other law that empowers or permits the 1st respondents to

take over the management of an assisted school. Further, it was

submitted that the petitioners have failed to disclose a legal right

to the performance of a legal duty of taking over the management

by the 1st respondent imposed by statute.

The following facts were submitted by the learned counsel for the

petitioners: In the year 2013/2014, a special unit of the Ministry

had investigated a series of malpractices, financial

misappropriations, irregularities, corruption, sexual abuse of

children, and failure to provide proper meals to the students in

the school. The special investigation unit had found that many

allegations had been proved and the children who were residents

in the school were not safe. Consequent to the said findings, the

Secretary to the Ministry of Education, by his letter dated

25.03.2015 directed the 5th respondent to take over the

management and control of the said school with effect from

10.03.2015 until further notice. Then, the 8th to 18th respondents

instituted Writ Application No. 173/15, seeking a writ of certiorari

8

quashing the said decision of the Secretary to the Ministry of

Education. When the said writ application was taken up in the

Court of Appeal, the parties had agreed to hand over the

management of the school back to the Management Society.

Now, again, as the management society mismanaged and did not

care about the welfare of the students, the learned counsel for the

petitioner contended that the petitioners filed this application for

writs seeking to hand over the management of the school to the

1st respondent. However, it should be stated that the learned

counsel for the petitioners did not mention any legal provision

that empowers the 1st respondent to take over the management of

this school.

I wish to consider first, the following two issues regarding the

maintainability of this application:

I. Whether the petitioners could maintain this application

without natural persons being named as the 1st to 7th

respondents.

II. Whether the performance of duty demanded by the

petitioners is permitted in law, and if not, whether the

petitioners could maintain this application.

Whether the petitioners could maintain this application without

natural persons being named as the 1st to 7th respondents.

The decision of the case of A. C. M. Haniffa v. The Chairman,

Urban Council, Nawalapitiya - 66 N.L.R. 48 directly deals with

this issue. In this case, it was held as follows:

In this application, the petitioner has made the Chairman, Urban

Council, Nawalapitiya, the respondent. The petitioner should have

named the person against whom a Writ of Mandamus can be

issued. The Chairman, Urban Council, Nawalapitiya, is not a

9

juristic person. The Privy Council has pointed out that the juristic

person must be created specially by statute (62 N. L. R. 169, 174,

and at 182-183; 65 N. L. R. 253). Even if the Chairman, Urban

Council, Nawalapitiya, was a juristic person, I fail to see how we

can issue a Mandamus on a juristic person. A Mandamus can

only issue against a natural person, who holds a public office.

If such a person fails to perform a duty after he has been ordered

by Court, he can be punished for contempt of Court. (Emphasis

added)

Mahanayake v. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Others

(2005) 2 Sri L.R. 193 is a case where the petitioner sought a writ of

Certiorari to quash the order of the 2nd Respondent Corporation

terminating her services and a writ of Mandamus to compel the 01st and

02nd Respondents to reinstate the Petitioner as directed by the 03rd

Respondent - Human Rights Commission. It was held that A Writ of

Mandamus could only issue against a natural person, who holds

public office. Petitioner cannot seek a writ of mandamus against

the 03rd Respondent the Human Rights Commission as it is not a

natural person and the Petitioner has failed to name the members

of the commission to seek this remedy.

The Supreme Court in Gnanasambanthan v, Rear Admiral

Perera and Others [(1998) 3 Sri L.R. 169 was called upon to

consider the necessary parties to an application for writs of

certiorari and mandamus and Amerasinghe J, held (at page 171):

In the matter before us, the petitioner seeks both a Writ of

Certiorari and a Writ of Mandamus. In any event, the question

before us is not whether the Chairman of REPIA could be cited

nominee officii, which perhaps was possible in respect of the

application for Certiorari but not in respect of the application

of Mandamus, (Emphasis added)

10

In view of the decisions of the aforementioned judicial authorities,

it is clear that in a writ of mandamus, a natural person must be

named as the respondent in order to grant relief to the petitioner.

In the case at hand, the 1st to 7th respondents are not natural

persons, and thus, I hold that a writ of mandamus could not be

issued. Among the reliefs prayed for in the prayer to the amended

petition, writs of mandamus prayed for in the prayer (b) and (d)

are against 1st respondent and the 1st, 4th, 6th, and 7th

respondents, respectively. Accordingly, those reliefs could not be

granted in law.

Next, it has to be considered whether the writ of prohibition

prayed for in prayer (c) to restrain the 8th to 18th respondents from

continuing as office bearers or members of the Special Education

Development Society of the said special school could be issued. In

the circumstances, where the substantial relief of a writ of

mandamus could not be issued to take over the management of

the school by the 1st respondent, no writ of prohibition can be

issued to suspend or remove the current board of management. If

such an order is issued without making an order to take over the

management of the school by somebody, it would result in the

school being left without a designated manager or management

board to manage its operations. Therefore, the writ prayed for in

prayer (c) also could not be issued.

I hold that this application cannot be maintained and must be

dismissed for the aforementioned reason of not naming natural

persons as respondents.

Now, I proceed to consider the aforementioned second issue.

Whether the performance of duty demanded by the petitioners is

permitted in law, and if not, whether the petitioners could

maintain this application

11

In the case at hand, the petitioners, in the petition or in their

written submissions, have failed to demonstrate that the 1st

respondent has a legal right to take over the management of the

assisted school. The only contention on behalf of the petitioners

on the issue of whether the 1st respondent has a legal right to take

over the management of the assisted school was that, on a

previous occasion, the secretary to the ministry of education

directed the 5th respondent, the Provincial Director of Education

of Uva Province, to take over the management, and as a result,

management was taken over by the 5th respondent for a limited

period. The objection raised on behalf of all respondents was that,

in the Education Ordinance or any other law, there is no provision

empowering or permitting the Secretary to the Ministry of

Education (1st respondent) to take over the management of the

school.

Section 36 of the Education Ordinance reads as follows:

36(1) The Director-General may appoint as the manager of an

assisted school any person recommended in writing by the

proprietor of the school.

36(4) The Director-General may suspend or remove from office the

manager of an assisted school either of the Director-

General's own motion or upon a written request made in

that behalf by the proprietor of the school.

The Director-General of Education is referred to as "Director-

General" in the above section. He has the power to appoint,

suspend or remove the management. Previously, the Special

Education Development Services Society that managed the

assisted school was suspended, and management was

temporarily delegated to the provincial director of education in the

Uva Province. However, no legal provision in any statute

authorizes the first respondent to take over management of the

12

school. Therefore, it is apparent that the petitioners seek a writ

of mandamus to direct the 1st respondent to perform a duty over

which he has no legal right.

It must be noted that the foundation of the writ of mandamus is

the existence of a legal right as held in Kaluarachchi v. Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation and Others SC Appeal No. 43/2013,

Decided on - 19th June 2019. It was held in this case that A court

should not grant a writ of mandamus to enforce a right which is

not legal and not based upon a public duty. Judicial intervention

based upon legitimate expectation should not be used as a tool

for enforcing a right purely of an equitable nature.

In Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka V. M/S Jafferjee

and Jafferjee (PVT) Limited, (2005) 1 Sri L.R. 89, it has been

stated that There is rich and profuse case law on Mandamus on

the conditions to be satisfied by the Applicant. Some of the

conditions precedent to the issue of Mandamus appear to be:

(a) The Applicant must have a legal right to the performance

of a legal duty by the parties against whom the Mandamus

is sought (R. V. Barnstaple Justices (1937) 54 TLR 36). The

foundation of Mandamus is the existence of a legal right

(Napier ex parte 1852 18oQB,o692oato695)

(b) The right to be enforced must be a "Public Right" and the

duty sought to be enforced must be of a public nature.

.

.

.

(j) Writ will not be issued where the Respondent has no

power to perform the act sought to be mandated.

(Emphasis added)

13

Hence, it is apparent that in the instant application, a writ cannot

be issued to take over the management of the school by the 1st

respondent because according to any provision of law, the

Secretary to the Ministry of Education (the 1st respondent) has no

powers to take over the management of the school.

As the petitioners seek a writ of mandamus directing the 1st

respondent to take over the management of the Wellassa

Subhagya Special School and since the 1st respondent has no

legal right to take over the management, the application of the

petitioners fails for this reason as well.

Apart from the aforesaid two issues, I believe that it is worth to

consider a matter mentioned in the written submissions tendered

on behalf of the 8th to 18th respondents. It has been mentioned

that the amended petition filed by the petitioners does not disclose

a demand and refusal which is also a condition precedent to the

issue of a writ of mandamus. There is merit in this contention. A

condition that has to be fulfilled before filing a writ of mandamus

is that the person or persons affected by the neglect of

performance of duty should have asked the public authority

concerned to perform that duty and the public authority should

have refused to perform that duty. If the public authority

wrongfully refused or neglected to perform the duty only, the

affected party could seek a writ of mandamus. In City Motor

Transit Co. Limited v. Wijesinghe- 63 N.L.R 156, the court cited

a dictum of Lord Denman C.J in the King v. Brennock and

Abergavenny Canal Navigation which declared that it is not

indeed necessary that the word refuse or any equivalent to it,

should be used; but there should be enough to show that the

party withheld compliance and distinctly determines not to do

what is required.

14

Also, in Pathirana v. Goonesekera - 66 NLR 464 (467), a portion

of the decision of The Queen v. Commissioners for

Special Purposes of the Income Tax [3 (1888) 21 Q. B. D.

313] was cited as follows: "Where officials having a public duty to

perform, refuse to perform it, mandamus will lie on the application

of a person interested to compel them to do so. The rule would

also apply where a public body fails to perform a public duty with

which it is charged."

Anyhow, in England and India, exceptions to the demand-refusal

rule have been set out in some cases. Exceptions to the demand-

refusal rule specified in the Judgments of R v. Hanley Revising

Barrister, (1912) 3 KB 518, 531; and Guru Charan v. Belonia

Vidyapith, AIR 1955 Trip 33 are as follows:

(a) Where it appears that a demand would be unavailing;

(b) Where the respondent has by his own conduct made a demand

impossible;

(c) Where the duty sought to be enforced is of a public nature

affecting the people at large and there is no one especially

empowered to demand performance;

(d) Where the duty is imperatively required by law of ministerial

officer, particularly where the respondent has done an act

which he calls a performance;

(e) Where a person has by inadvertence omitted to do some act

which he was under a duty to do and the time within which he

can do it has passed.

However, the case at hand does not fall within the aforesaid

exceptions. In the circumstances that the petitioners have not

shown that they have made an application to the 1st respondent

to take over the management, and he has refused, this application

is liable to be dismissed for this reason as well. Even if this

application was found to fall under one of the aforementioned

15

exceptional circumstances, the application must be dismissed for

the two main reasons stated above.

Accordingly, the application for writs prayed for by the petitioners

is dismissed without costs.
