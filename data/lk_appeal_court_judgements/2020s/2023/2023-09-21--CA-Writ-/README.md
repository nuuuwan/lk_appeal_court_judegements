RESPONDENTS

Before: M. T. Mohammed Laffar, J.

S. U. B. Karalliyadde, J.

Counsel:

Chanuka Ekanayake for the Petitioners.

Sehan Soysa, SSC for the Respondents.

Argument concluded:

By way of Written Submissions.

Written submissions tendered on:

28.11.2022 by the Petitioners

25.11.2022 by the 1st 3rd Respondents

Decided on: 21.09.2023

S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The 2nd and 3rd Respondents are respectively the President and the Secretary of the 1st

Respondent Trade Union known as Sri Lanka Thapal Sevaka Ekamuthu Sangamaya. It

is a Trade Union of the Postal Department employees concerned with this Writ

5

Application. This action has been instituted challenging Circular No. 05/2019 dated

09.05.2019 marked as P-6 issued by the Post Master General. Before P-6 was issued

the Post Master General had issued Circular No. 14/2014 dated 07.08.2014 marked as

P-4 in terms of Circular No. 06/2006 (X1) dated 16.07.2014 marked as P-3 of the

Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration. P-3 was regarding the payment of salary

increments to the State officers who have satisfied all other qualifications and were

stagnating on the maximum of the salary scale due to the unavailability of new service

minutes. The position of the Petitioner is that the Circular of the Post Master General

marked as P-4 is in conformity with the Public Administration Ministry Circular

marked as P-3 and the subsequent Circular marked as P-6 does not give the correct

interpretation to P-3 and therefore P-6 is illegal, erroneous, ultra vires, unfair, arbitrary,

mala fide, unreasonable, unjustifiable, against the legitimate expectation of the

Petitioners, malicious and capricious. The substantial reliefs sought in the amended

Petition dated 01.02.2021 are, inter alia,

c) Issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision and/or

actions and /or attempts of the 1st and/or the 2nd Respondents under the Circular

marked P-6.

d) Issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus for the 1st and/or 2nd

Respondents to comply with the Circulars marked as P-3 and P-4.

f) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus for the 1st and/or 2nd

Respondents to repay the deducted salary increments to the members of the 1st

Petitioner Trade Union with effect from 09.05.2019 and/or from the date which

the purported Circular bearing No. 05/2019 was implemented.

The necessity for the Public Administration Ministry to issue P-3 is explained in

paragraph 2 of the P-3. Accordingly, the intention of issuing P-3 was to take steps to

pay salary increments beyond the maximum of the salary scale to the State officers who

were stagnating on the maximum of the salary scale of Grades in between due to not

revising service minutes or scheme of recruitment or scheme of promotions as per the

Public Administration Circular No. 06/2006 dated 25.04.2006 marked as P-2(a) until

they absorb into the relevant Grade after obtaining the approval for service minute or

6

scheme of recruitment or scheme of promotions. P-2(a) came into effect from

01.01.2006. The new service minutes (marked as P2(b)) were approved by the Public

Service Commission on 21.06.2012. According to the new service minutes, the officers

in the Postal Department belong to the service category of Supervisory Management

Assistants-Technical/ Non-Technical. The said service category consists of three

Grades, i.e., Grade III, Grade II and Grade I. While Grade III is the Grade to which the

new appointments are made, Grade I is the highest Grade among the three Grades. In

terms of the new service minutes, the officers should pass the Efficiency Bar

Examination (ldh_laIu;d lvhs Nd.h) to be eligible to get promotions from Grade

III to Grade II or Grade II to Grade I. Before the new service minutes came into effect

the service minutes dated 01.03.1993 marked as P-2(c)/1R1 (old service minutes) were

applied to the postal service. By the old service minutes, the recruitment and promotion

criteria which were there until 01.03.1993 restructured and the postal service was made

a combined service. Accordingly, the officers were categorized as Class B Grade II and

Class B Grade I officers. Recruitments were done to the Class B Grade II. The

promotions were given from Class B Grade II to Class B Grade I upon passing the

Common Charge Examination (fmd ldh_Ndr Nd.h).

It is clear that by issuing Circulars marked as P-4 and P-6 the Post Master General

intended to make arrangements to pay salary increments to the officers in the postal

service in terms of the Public Administration Circular marked as P-3. In P-6 it has been

stated that in order to be entitled to salary increments in terms of P-3, the officers

concerned should have passed the Common Charge Examination (fmd ldh_Ndr

Nd.h) held under the old service minutes and as a result of paying salary increments

beyond the maximum salary scale to those who had not satisfied that requirement had

created a salary anomaly. The learned Counsel for the Petitioners argues that the words

satisfying all other qualifications in P-3 construe the officers who passed the

Efficiency Bar Examination and not the Common Charge Examination (fmd

ldh_Ndr Nd.h).

The position of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the operation of the old

service minutes has been stopped/terminated with effect from 01.01.2006, the date on

which the Public Administrative Circular No. 06/2006 marked as P-2(a) came into

effect and from that date onwards the new service minutes should apply. The Public

Service Commission approved the new service minutes of the officers in the postal

7

service on 21.06.2012 and it does not provide that the new service minutes apply

retrospectively. Therefore, the new service minutes do not have a retrospective effect.

In the Income-Tax Officer, Alleppey vs M.C. Ponnoose & Ors1, Grover J. dealt with the

issue of whether subordinate legislation has a retrospective effect,

The courts will not, therefore, ascribe retrospectively to new laws affecting

rights unless, by express words or necessary implication, it appears that such

was the intention of the Legislature. Parliament can delegate its legislative

power within the recognized limits. Where any rule or regulation is made by any

person or authority to whom such powers have been delegated by the

Legislature it may or may not be possible to make the same to give retrospective

operation. It will depend on the language employed in the statutory provision

which may in express terms or by necessary implication empower the authority

concerned to make a rule or regulation with retrospective effect. But where no

such language is to be found it has been held by the courts that the persons or

authority exercising subordinate legislative functions cannot make a rule,

regulation or by-law which can operate with retrospective effect.

In the recent Indian judgement Bharat Sanchar Nigam LTD. And Others vs. M/S Tata

Communications Ltd2, it was further held that,

The power to make retrospective legislation enables the Legislature to

obliterate an amending Act and restore the law as it existed before the amending

Act, but at the same time, administrative/executive orders or circulars, as the

case may be, in the absence of any legislative competence cannot be made

applicable with retrospective effect. Only a law could be made retrospectively

if it was expressly provided by the Legislature in the Statute. Keeping in mind

the afore-stated principles of law on the subject, we are of the view that the

applicability of the circular dated 12th June 2012 to be effective retrospectively

1 1970 AIR 385, 1970 SCR (1) 678 2 Civil Appeal no(s).1699-1723 of 2015; (SC) September 22, 2022

8

from 1st April 2009, in revising the infrastructure charges, is not legally

sustainable and to this extent, we are in agreement with the view expressed by

the Tribunal under the impugned judgment.

Accordingly, the new service minutes should apply from the date it was approved by

the Public Service Commission, i.e., with effect from 21.06.2012. Therefore, the Court

cannot accept the argument of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner that old

service minutes had been stopped/ terminated with effect from 01.01.2006. Until

21.06.2012, to be eligible for salary increments, the officers in the postal service had to

pass the Common Charge Examination (fmd ldh_Ndr Nd.h) mentioned under item

6 in the old service minutes and after 21.06.2012 as provided under items 8 and 10 in

the new service minutes, the Efficiency Bar Examination (ldh_laIu;d lvhs Nd.h).

Drawing the attention of Court to the final column in a document marked as P-2(d), the

learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argues that the officers mentioned in P2(d)

had passed the Efficiency Bar Examination (ldh_laIu;d lvhs Nd.h) to be eligible

for salary increments in terms of the new service minutes. The position of the learned

State Counsel appearing for the Respondents is that, to be eligible for salary increments

they should have passed the Common Charge Examination (fmd ldh_Ndr Nd.h) as

provided under the old service minutes and not the Efficiency Bar Examination

(ldh_laIu;d lvhs Nd.h) as provided in the new service minutes but none of them

has passed the Common Charge Examination. The position of the learned State Counsel

appearing for the Respondents is that the final column in P-2(d) refers to the service

conditions mentioned in item 5 of the old service minutes which applied to the newly

joined officers of the postal service. Item 5 (1) () in the old service minutes provides

that:

,

. ....

. 23,040/=

9

.

.

45

.

.

Accordingly, the selected candidates should have followed a training course and at the

end of the training period they had to sit for an exam. That exam had been considered

as an Efficiency Bar Examination to be eligible to go beyond the salary scale of Rs.

23,040/= which was the maximum salary scale in Class B Grade II under the old service

minutes. The position of the Respondents is that the Efficiency Bar Examination

mentioned in the final column in P-2(d) is not the Efficiency Bar Examination

(ldh_laIu;d lvhs Nd.h) mentioned in the new service minutes. To substantiate the

position of the Respondents, a certificate issued to a trainee who had completed the

training course in terms of item 5 of the old service minutes and a certificate issued to

an officer who had passed the Common Charge Examination (fmd ldh_Ndr Nd.h)

in terms of item 8 of the new service minutes tendered to Court marked as 1R7 and 1R8

respectively. According to P2(d), the officers mentioned in the last column in P-2(d)

had passed the Efficiency Bar Examination (ldh_laIu;d lvhs Nd.h) mentioned in

that document between 1985-1995 i.e. before the new service minutes came into

operation in 2012. Before 2012, the applicable service minutes were the old service

minutes. In terms of the old service minutes, the Examination which had to pass for

promotions was the Common Charge Examination (fmd ldh_Ndr Nd.h) and not the

Efficiency Bar Examination (ldh_laIu;d lvhs Nd.h). The Court therefore cannot

accept the position of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners that the officers

mentioned in P2(d) had passed the Common Charge Examination (fmd ldh_Ndr

Nd.h) which was the requirement in terms of the old service minutes for promotions.

Under the above-stated circumstances, I hold that the impugned Circular issued by the

Post Master General marked as P-6 is in conformity with the Public Administration

10

Circular marked as P-3 and therefore legal. Therefore, the Petitioners are not entitled to

the reliefs sought in the amended Petition.

The Writ Application is dismissed. No costs ordered.
