ORDER

P.Kumararatnam,J.

The Accused-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) filing

this Application has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court to grant bail

to him upon suitable condition as this Court considers appropriate.

The Petitioner was arrested on 16.10.2019 by the officers attached to

the Police Narcotics Bureau. He was produced before the Magistrate of

Negombo in the case bearing No. M/5569/19. It was mentioned that

the Petitioner was to go abroad on the date of his arrest. According to

the detectives, some substances which reacted for Heroin

(Diacetylmorphine) was recovered from the Petitioner and the substance

weighed about 99.651 grams.

The production had been sent to the Government Analyst Department

on 21/0710019. After analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded

the report to Negombo Magistrate Court on 20/07/2020. According to

the Government Analyst, 48.003 grams of pure Heroin

(Diacetylmorphine) had been detected from the substance sent for the

analysis.

According to the Petitioner, at the time of his arrest, no drugs were

recovered from his custody.

Although a bail application was filed before the High court of Negombo,

but was dismissed by the Learned High Court Judge on 08.07.2021.

Further, a revision application was filed in the Court of Appeal to revise

the said order of the High Court, it too had been dismissed by the Court

on 28.03.2021.

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in

support of her Revision Application.

1. The Petitioner has been incarcerated from 16.10.2019.

2. The parents of the Petitioner have been seriously ill.

3. The Petitioner has been incarcerated for nearly three and half

years without the High Court trial against the him being

commenced.

The Learned State Counsel submitted that the delay is not an

exceptional circumstance to be considered to enlarge the suspect on

bail. Further, the time spent for preparing the indictment does not

constitute an exceptional circumstance. Further, indictment has

already been sent to the High Court of Negombo and the pre-trial

conference was over and the case is fixed doe trial on 23.11.2023.

The suspect is in remand almost three and half years. According to

Government Analyst Report the pure quantity of Heroin detected is

48.003 grams.

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what

is exceptional circumstances must be considered on its own facts and

circumstances on a case-by-case basis.

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

In CA(PHC)APN 107/2018 decided on 19.03.2019 the court held that

remanding for a period of one year and five months without being

served with the in indictment was considered inter alia in releasing the

suspect on bail. According to the Petitioner, at present her family is

going through untold hardship without proper income and care.

The Section 83 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act

which was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states:

83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under

sections 54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail

by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 84 and 85, a person

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A

and section 54B-

(a) of which the pure quantity of the dangerous drug, trafficked,

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A;

and

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment, shall not

be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in exceptional

circumstances.

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in

exceptional circumstances.

In this case the pure quantity of Heroin detected in the production by

the Government Analyst is 48.003 grams. Hence, this court has

jurisdiction to consider granting of bail as per the new amendment.

The Counsel for the Petitioner urged this Court to consider that

detaining a suspect without trial being commenced for an extended

period of time amounts to a violation of his fundamental rights which

can be considered as an exceptional ground.

In Nasher v. Director of Public Prosecution [2020] VSCA 144 the

court held that:

a combination of delay, onerous custodial conditions, and the

relative weakness of the prosecution case may, when considered

with all relevant circumstances, compel the conclusion that

exceptional circumstances have been established. [Emphasis added]

In Union of India v K.A.Najeeb Cri.Appeal 98 of 2021, the Supreme

of India held that:

Adverting to the case at hand, we are conscious of the fact that the

charge levelled against the respondent are grave and a serious threat

to societal harmony. Had it been a case at the threshold, we would

have outrightly turned down the respondents prayer. However,

keeping in mind the length of the period spent by him in custody and

the unlikelihood of the trial being completed anytime soon, the High

Court appears to have been left with no other option except to grant

bail.

The right to trial without undue delay is found in numerous

international and regional human rights instruments; for example, the

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 14(3)(c), the

American Convention on Human Rights (Article 8(1), the African

Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (Article 7(1)(d), and the

European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and

Fundamental Freedoms (Article 6(1).

Hence, I consider the delay more than three and half years in remand

falls into the category of excessive and oppressive delay considering the

circumstances of this case. Hence, considering all the circumstances of

CA BAIL 199-2023

7 | P a g e

this case, the suspect has very good exceptional circumstances to

consider this application in his favour.

Offences under Section 54A(a) and 54A(c) of the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is no

doubt serious offences but seriousness of the offence alone cannot form

a ground to refuse bail. In considering these matters, the court must

bear in mind the presumption of innocence.

Further, bail should never be withheld as punishment. Granting of bail

is primarily at the discretion of the Courts. The discretion should be

exercised with due care and caution taking into account the facts and

circumstances of each case.

Considering all these factors into account, especially the period in

remand, the pure quantity of Heroin detected and the circumstances of

the case, I consider this an appropriate case to grant bail to the

Petitioner. Hence, I order the Petitioner be granted bail with following

strict conditions.

1. Cash bail of Rs.100,000/=.

2. To provide 02 sureties. They must sign a bond of two million

each.

3. The Petitioner and the sureties must reside in the address given

until conclusion of his case.

4. Not to approach any prosecution witnesses directly or indirectly

or to interfere with.

5. To surrender his passport if any, to court and not to apply for a

travel document. The Controller of the Immigration and

Emigration is informed of the travel ban on the Petitioner.

6. To report to the Police Narcotics Bureau, Colombo-01 on the last

Sunday of every month between 9am to 1pm.

7. Any breach of these conditions is likely to result in the

cancellation of his bail.
