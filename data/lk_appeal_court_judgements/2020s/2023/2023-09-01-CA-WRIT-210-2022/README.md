The Petitioner seeks both a writ of certiorari quashing the 1st Respondent's decisions

(contained in 'P38' and 'P27') not to grant permission to construct a house and a writ of

mandamus directing the 11th, 20th and 21st Respondents to approve the relevant building plan,

which was submitted by the Petitioner.

The Petitioner states that she and her family members claim an undisputed title in respect of

the subject land for their undivided share for a period of over 80 years. The old house that

exists in the said subject land is supposedly the birthplace of her elder brother and sister. The

1st- 4th, 6th- 10th, and 12th- 19th Respondents (Respondents) deny such averments of the

Petitioner on the basis that they are unaware of the respective averments.

The 20th Respondent- Hingurakgoda Pradeshiya Sabha has issued a development license upon

an application made by the Petitioner in order to construct a house in the subject land

described as Lot 304 in the plan marked 'P6'. When the Petitioner and her family members

with such sanction of the Pradeshiya Sabha commenced the construction of the house on

19.04.2016, the entire construction team including the Petitioner has been arrested by a team

of Wildlife Officers led by the 4th Respondent.

The Petitioner contends that her private land which is subjected to this case has been included

in the National Forest Reserve. Such Forest Reserve has been declared under the name

"Kaudulla Minneriya Jungle Corridor" as per the Gazette Notification No. 1343/10 ('P11')

published under section 2 (2) of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance (Ordinance) on

01.06.2004. The Petitioner challenged the said Gazette Notification 'P11' by way of a Writ

Application bearing case No. CA/Writ/223/2013. The Attorney General during the

pendency of the said case has informed the Court of Appeal that the said Gazette would be

withdrawn as it had been issued under a wrong provision of law. The proceedings of the Court

of Appeal dated 29.11.2018 are marked as 'P15'.

The argument of the Petitioner in the instant Application is twofold. Firstly, she argues that

the Respondents have failed to follow the procedure laid down in section 9A (2) of the said

Ordinance, which specifically provides a series of steps to be followed when granting approval

for a development activity or trade or business within the areas specified in section 9A (1).

Page 6 of 11

Secondly, the Petitioner asserts that there are several houses and buildings located in the

blocks of land adjacent to that owned by the Petitioner. It is further stated that even at present

certain constructions are being carried out with the approval of the relevant authorities, within

the area of land adjoining the Petitioner's private land. The Petitioner complains that the 1st

Respondent while refusing permission for the Petitioner to construct a dwelling in her land

has failed to take any steps against the aforesaid constructions. Out of the two points

mentioned above the Petitioners cogent argument is that the decisions reflected in the

impugned documents marked P37 and P38 are contrary to law, as the relevant authorities

have failed to adhere to the procedure stipulated in the section 9A when they refused to grant

permission in respect of the Petitioners request. Now I must examine the effect of section 9A

of the Ordinance upon the Petitioners request for permission to put up a dwelling house

within the subject land.

Section 9A of the Ordinance imposes restrictions on development activity within a distance

of one mile of the boundary of any National Reserve. As per the interpretation section [72(1)]

a development activity means any activity which has an impact on the physical nature of

the land or the natural biological phenomenon of fauna and flora of such land. The

provisions of section 9A (1) are subject to section 3A (1) which stipulates that no person shall,

within one mile of the boundary of a National Reserve, construct a tourist hotel or provide

any services or facilities similar to the services or facilities provided by a tourist hotel. It is

paramount to note that the permission sought by the Petitioner was to only put up a dwelling

house.

Section 9A-

"(1) Subject to the provisions of section 3A, no person or organization, whether private

or State shall within a distance of one mile of the boundary of any National Reserve

declared by Order made under section 2, carry out any development activity of any

description whatsoever without obtaining the prior written approval of the Director-

General.

(2) Upon receipt of an application for a permit to carry out a development activity or

trade or business within the area specified in subsection (1), the Director-General may

require the applicant to furnish an Initial Environmental Examination Report or an

Page 7 of 11

Environmental Impact Assessment Report, as the case may be, relating to such

development activity or trade or business. It shall be the duty of the applicant to

comply with such requirements. Every Initial Environmental Examination Report or

an Environmental Impact Assessment Report shall contain such particulars as may be

prescribed.

(3) The Director-General shall, on receipt of an Environmental Impact Assessment

Report or an Initial Environmental Examination Report, as the case may be, furnished

to him by an applicant in compliance with any requirement imposed on such applicant

under subsection (2)

(a)submit a copy of such assessment or examination, as the case may be, to the

Committee appointed by the Director General in that behalf, for its comments,

if any; and

(b)by notice published in the Gazette, notify the place and time at which such

assessment or examination, as the case may be, will be available for inspection

by the public and invite the public to make comments, if any, thereon.

(4) The Committee shall within sixty days of an Environmental Impact Assessment or

an Initial Environmental Examination, as the case may be, being submitted to it under

subsection (3), make its comments, if any, thereon, to the Director-General.

(5) Any member of the public may within thirty days from the date on which a notice

under subsection (3) relating to such assessment or examination, as the case may be,

is published in the Gazette make his comments, if any, thereon, to the Director-

General.

(6) In deciding whether to issue a permit under subsection (2) authorizing a person to

carry out a development activity or trade or business within the area specified in

subsection (1), the Director-General shall have regard to any comments made under

subsections (4) and (5) on the environment impact assessment or examination, as the

case may be, if any, relating to such activity, trade or business.

(7) the Director-General shall, within sixty days of the receipt by him of any comments

made under subsections (4) and (5), make the decision referred to in subsection (6)."

It appears that the above provisions prescribe a clear process that needs to be followed by the

Director General of Wildlife Conservation when he receives an application for permission to

carry out any development activity within the area described in the section. The Petitioner

relies on precedent enunciated in the cases of Bradbury and Others v. Enfield London Borough

Council (1967) 1 WLR 1311 at 1324, Associated Provincial Pictures House Ltd v. Wednesbury

Corporation (1948)- 1KB 223 at 229, Jayantha Wijesekara and Others v. Attorney General and

Others SC (FR) 243-245/2006 and Council of Civil Service Union v. Minister for the Civil Service

(1985) AC 374 at 410. Based on the judgements mentioned above the Petitioner submits that

it is imperative that the procedure laid down in the relevant statute should be followed

properly.

In support of the aforesaid argument, the Petitioner has placed reliance on the fact that the

relevant authorities conducted a field visit without affording an opportunity for the Petitioner

to furnish an Initial Environmental Examination Report (IEE Report) or an Environmental

Impact Assessment Report (EIA Report) prescribed in section 9A (2) of the Ordinance. The

impugned letters dated 10.03.2021 marked 'P27 (R3) and letter dated 04.03.2022 marked

P38 were to refuse the Petitioners application seeking permission to put up a dwelling

house. The letter marked R1 discloses that the Petitioner made the said request on

10.12.2019. It is apparent that the said request was initially refused by the letter marked P27

based on a field visit carried out by several officials in addition to those of the Department of

Wildlife Conservation. The letter marked P38 has been issued on a field visit conducted on

23.12.2019. It can be assumed that the previous refusal marked P27 has also been issued

on the same field visit and there seems to be no dispute among parties on that point. The main

reasons for refusal cited in "P27" and "P28" are identical and they appear to be as follows:

1. Inhabitation of wild animals due to non-occupation of the subject land for a long

period of time.

2. The recommendation to vest the Petitioners private land to the Department of

Wildlife Conservation, subject to compensation in line with the government valuation

criteria.

3. Providing an alternate land to the Petitioner in the event the Petitioners land is vested.

The report issued consequent to the said field visit is annexed to the Statement of Objections

filed on behalf of the said Respondents and it is marked as R5. A perusal of the

Page 9 of 11

aforementioned field visit report reveals that it includes, to a greater degree, only the views

and recommendations of various participating government officials. I am puzzled by the

recommendation therein to acquire the land of the Petitioner as a consequence of her

application for permission to put up a dwelling.

The view expressed by the Divisional Secretary of Hingurakgoda in the said Report is that no

permission could be granted in favour of the Petitioner. However, no legal basis has been

disclosed to that effect by the said Divisional Secretary. In the meantime, the Project Legal

Consultant queries whether the Department of Wildlife Conservation has the power to

regulate the other institutions whose approval may be required to grant permission for a

development activity. The said Legal Consultant has observed in the Report that the

Petitioner owned about ten acres of land and an opportunity should be accorded to the

Petitioner to put up a structure using either planks or stilts. He further opines that not

permitting such a structure would cause prejudice to the long-standing title of the Petitioner

and accordingly he recommends granting an opportunity for the Petitioner provided there is

no legal barrier to that effect. Anyhow the representative of the legal division of the relevant

Department and the Director (Reservation Management) have stated in the Report that the

Petitioner should not be allowed to put up a house at the relevant location. One of the reasons

raised by the said two officers was on the pretext that the other landowners of the area would

also tend to make similar applications. The same view has been illustrated in clause 4.21 of

the impugned letter P38. Moreover, I am unable to find a nexus between the said Ordinance

and the alleged zone referred to in the said report by the name Praeyrana ( )

and thus, I am not inclined to accept any vocabulary used by the officials on their own

assumptions or for their mere convenience. No reasonable explanation has been given as to

how they have derived the word .

The primary defense taken by the 1st Respondent to justify his decision not to allow the

construction commenced by the Petitioner emanates upon the buffer zone of the Minneriya

National Park. The 1st Respondent contends that the subject land which is claimed by the

Petitioner is located within the said buffer zone. On the contrary, the aforementioned report

indicates that the area in which the subject land is located is a wildlife habitat. Anyhow, this

court has not received sufficient proof as to whether the subject area is a designated buffer

Page 10 of 11

zone in accordance with section 2 (1) of the Ordinance. Even the Gazette Notification marked

R2 is not an order issued under section 2 (1) but under section 2 (2) of the Ordinance by

which the Minister has the authority to declare a specific area to be a sanctuary or a managed

elephant reserve for the purposes of the Ordinance.

On a careful perusal of section 9A (1) of the Ordinance, it is implied that carrying out any

development activity as defined in section 72 (1) is not a prohibited act. The word prohibited

in its literal sense means any activity which is formally forbidden by law. Carrying out a

development activity as specified in section 9A (1) can be classified not as a prohibited activity

but as a restricted activity that can be carried out under a license or subject to a condition.

One of the underlying purposes of the Ordinance as per its Preamble is to provide for the

prevention of commercial or other misuse of such fauna and flora and their habitats. Thus,

the refusal of Petitioner's request to construct a dwelling house should be done only according

to the procedure laid down in the said Ordinance and not on assumptions or

recommendations made without a legal basis. In other words, the decision to refuse or grant

permission for a development activity under the said section 9A should be made rationally,

reasonably and without illegality.

I am convinced that most of the recommendations that appear in the said field report R3

have no legal basis. The learned Deputy Solicitor General attempted to equate fulfilling the

requirements stipulated in the said section 9A (2) to submitting the field visit report marked

R3. I am unable to agree with such a proposition as the said field visit report cannot be

considered a final decision made by the Director General of Wildlife Conservation under

section 9A of the said Ordinance. To my mind, the said field report cannot be equated to an

IEE Report or an EIA Report. As I mentioned earlier the said report R3 is mixed with

opinions and recommendations of several government authorities and there is no substantive

decision made according to law. In these circumstances, I am compelled to arrive at a

conclusion that the decisions reflected in the impugned documents P27 and P38 have been

made without following the due process prescribed in section 9A of the Ordinance and such

decisions should not be sustained.

Now I must advert to the second point of the argument raised by the Petitioner who asserts

that the Respondents have failed to take any steps against the ongoing construction carried

Page 11 of 11

out with the approval of the relevant authorities within the area adjoining the Petitioners

private land. The Petitioner contends that such construction including houses and buildings

is clearly reflected by the photographs marked P39(a) to P39(h). Generally, fairness is when

everyone is treated equally and no one is left out. I take the view that the Director- General

when exercising his powers under section 9A is required to strike a balance, lawfully, between

the procedure laid down in section 9A and the rules of fairness. However, I need not lengthen

this judgement by analyzing the Petitioner's said second argument in a detailed manner as I

have already found that the impugned documents P27 and P38 are liable to be quashed.

In light of the above, I proceed to grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari

quashing the decisions reflected in the documents marked P27 and P38. Anyhow, I am not

inclined to issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus as prayed for in the prayer of

the petition, as seeking such relief by the Petitioner certainly goes against her own stand that

the 1st Respondent has not followed the proper procedure when refusing the Petitioners

application. It is an admitted fact by the Petitioner that in terms of section 9A of the said

Ordinance, no person or organization, whether private or state shall within a distance of one

mile of the boundary of any National Reserve declared by an order made under section 2,

conduct any development activity of any description whatsoever, without obtaining the prior

written approval (Vide- Paragraph 23 and 25 of the Petition). Based on all the circumstances

of this case I need to make an observation that the 1st Respondent is duty-bound to evaluate

any fresh application under section 9A of the Ordinance in respect of the subject land

according to law.
