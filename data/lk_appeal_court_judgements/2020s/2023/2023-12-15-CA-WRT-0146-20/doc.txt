purported decision made by the 1st Respondent and/or 2nd Respondent to

Parliament 2020.

d) grant an Interim Order restraining the 1st Respondent and/or 2nd

Respondent and/or those claiming there under from convening the Sri

Lanka Youth Parliament 2020 until the final determination of this matter.

Facts of the case

3) The Petitioner is a law student at the Sri Lanka Law College of Colombo

from February 2018. He had been elected as the President of the Law

College Student Union.

4) The 1st Respondent is the Chairman of the National Youth Services

Council. The National Youth Services Council is the 2nd Respondent which

will be referred to as NYSC hereinafter. The NYSC had been established

with the aim of empowering the youth, facilitating diverse learning

opportunities and to create a platform for the youth to raise their voices in

respect of the issues that affect the youth and the communities. The Youth

Parliament was established in order to facilitate the aforesaid facts.

5) The majority of the members of the Youth Parliament are elected through

an election process. The candidate of the Youth Parliament represents

Youth Clubs/Institutions of their respective Districts, several recognized

National Higher Education Institutions including Universities and other

Academic Institutions including the Sri Lanka Law College.

6) The 1st Respondent had written to the Principal of the Sri Lanka Law

College informing that the students are given an opportunity to take part

in the Youth Parliament. Thereby had intimated that a student

representative needed to be elected to represent the Sri Lanka Law College.

7) On the aforementioned letter of the 1st Respondent had stated the NYSC

anticipates nomination from the Sri Lanka Law College and shall be called

on 25th February 2020 and the election should be held on 2nd March 2020

C.A. WRIT No. 146-20

at the Sri Lanka Law College. The Petitioner and the 3rd and 4th

Respondents had submitted their nominations to contest the said election.

8) However, the Principal of the Sri Lanka Law College had responded to the

1st Respondents letter that the Principal does not have the authority to

grant permission to hold the election without obtaining prior approval of

the Council of Legal Education.

9) As the Sri Lanka Law College had not granted permission, the election had

been held at the Divisional Secretariat Hulftsdorp Colombo as scheduled.

The election results had been published on the website. Accordingly, the

Petitioner had obtained the majority of the votes.

10) On or around 4th March 2020 the said election results were removed and

not visible to the public. The Sri Lanka Law College was not included in

the said list. The Petitioner has contended that the 1st Respondent had

annulled the law students election results after receiving the letter sent by

the Principal, Sri Lanka Law College.

11) On the said grounds, the Petitioner had stated that the said decision taken

by the 1st Respondent is wrongful, unlawful, arbitrary, mala fide, and ultra

virus and it violated the legitimate expectation of the Petitioner. Therefore,

the Petitioner had sought the reliefs prayed for in the petition.

12) The 1st and 2nd Respondents had denied the aforesaid position and

contended the order sought to be quashed, is not an order with statutory

flavour.

13) Further, the 1st and 2nd Respondents had stated that the National Youth

Parliament is a project of NYSC and is not governed by any statute or any

Gazette notification.

14) The said process relating to the election of Youth Parliament is governed

by the National Youth Parliament Constitution.

15) The 1st Respondent has the authority to annul any election on the

recommendation of the District and/or National Committee if any

C.A. WRIT No. 146-20

5

malpractice, unlawful or any act of indiscipline was to take place at the

election.

16) The election to nominate a student from the Sri Lanka Law College was

annulled as the Legal Council had not authorized the Principal to hold the

election at the Sri Lanka Law College.

17) The Petitioner had used undue influence to get himself nominated at the

election held at the Divisional Secretariat and the other students had not

been given an opportunity to participate at the said elections.

18) Considering the said facts as recommended by the National Committee of

the Youth Council, the 1st Respondent had decided to annul the elections.

19) On the said grounds, the Respondents have sought to dismiss the

application made by the Petitioner.

Disputed facts

20) When this matter was taken up for argument on 4th September 2023

both parties agreed to conclude the case by way of written submissions.

21) Considering the written submissions and the documents submitted by

the Petitioner and the Respondents the following disputed facts need to

be considered to arrive at my conclusion.

I. Is the 2nd Respondent a statutory authority?

II. If so, is selecting candidates for the Youth Parliament governed by the

said statutory provisions?

III. If not, can the decision taken by the 1st and 2nd Respondents to annul

the elections of the Sri Lanka Law College be quashed invoking the rights

of the Writ Jurisdiction?

C.A. WRIT No. 146-20

I. Is the 2nd Respondent a statutory authority?

22) The 2nd Respondent has admitted that the 2nd Respondent, National Youth

Service Council is a statutory body. However, the said National Youth

Service Act No. 69 of 1979 had not provided any provisions as stated in

paragraph 3b of the petition.

23) In the said circumstances, it can be admitted that the 2nd Respondent is a

statutory body and the 1st Respondent is the Chairman/Director General

of the National Youth Services Council.

II. If so, is selecting candidates for the Youth Parliament governed

by the said statutory provisions?

24) The issue that had arisen in the instant action was quashing the election

held by the Youth Services Council for the Sri Lanka Law College students

to select a member for the National Youth Parliament on 2nd March 2020.

25) The 1st and 2nd Respondents have taken up a preliminary objection that

the letter or the order the Petitioner is seeking to quash is not an order

with a statutory flavour.

26) In considering the said preliminary objection, the National Youth Service

Council Act does not refer to establishing the Sri Lanka Youth Parliament.

There is no statute to prove the Youth Parliament is governed by the

National Youth Service Council Act. The only proof established by the

Petitioner is that there is a Constitution under which the election process

and the nominations were governed for selecting the Youth Parliament

which is not a statute and it is only incorporated to manage the affairs of

the Sri Lanka Youth Parliament.

27) In observing the said facts, on the face of it, the Petitioner has failed to

establish in this application that the decisions taken by the 1st Respondent

is binding under the National Youth Service Council Act.

28) Therefore, the most pertinent issue in this application is, can the said

decision be challenged under the Writ Jurisdiction. In a decided case of

C.A. WRIT No. 146-20

7

Trade Exchange (Ceylon) Ltd., v Asian Hotels Corporation1, in the said

judgement it was held by the Supreme Court that only a State organ

created by a statute would be amenable to writ, and a company in which

the State (through the CWE) held 90% of the shares was not amenable to

writ.

29) Further, in the case of Meril v Dayananda de Silva and others2 Justice

U. De Z. Gunawardana in reference to the facts of the case expressed that;

As certiorari and mandamus...are public law remedies, it is

important to know whether the relevant issue or decision under

consideration in this matter involves public law The answer to

the question on the issue is: a public law issue depends on

either of the two matters or on both viz (i) source of power of the

authority making the decision; (ii) the nature of the function that

the authority exercises, or, sometimes, on both the above

consideration.

30) In the book, Administrative Law3 by Sir William Wade it is

stated that;

Certiorari and prohibition are employed primarily for the control

of inferior courts, tribunals and administrative authorities

Both certiorari and prohibition, in their modern applications for

the control of administrative decisions, lie primarily only to

statutory authorities. The reason for this is that nearly all public

administrative power is statutory.

C.A. WRIT No. 146-20

31) Further, S.F.A. Coorey in his Principles of Administrative Law

in Sri Lanka4 states that;

If a public officer in the discharge of official duties makes a

decision in violation of, or in disregard of circular, instructions

or rules, the question arises whether such decision could be

quashed by certiorari. If such circular, instructions or rules,

does not have the status of law or statutory force, no certiorari

lies.

32) It is obvious, as per the aforesaid decisions, a Writ Jurisdiction is a public

law remedy. Therefore, the Petitioner seeking to quash the order made on

the Constitution of the Youth Council has no bearing of an administrative

decision taken by the 2nd Respondent.

III. If not, can the decision taken by the 1st and 2nd Respondents to

annul the elections of the Sri Lanka Law College be quashed

invoking the rights of the Writ Jurisdiction?

33) Now, I draw my attention to the prayers pleaded by the Petitioner in his

petition dated 30th June 2020.

34) The Petitioner by the said prayers has sought to quash the 2nd

Respondents decision made by the letter dated 4th March 2020 under the

Writ of Certiorari and to direct the 1st and 2nd Respondents to appoint the

Petitioner to the Youth Parliament issuing a Writ of Mandamus.

35) On perusal of the journal entries this Court has not issued an interim

order in the instant action. The Petitioner has pleaded to quash the letter

issued by the 2nd Respondent to cancel the election held by the National

Youth Services Council to select a member from the Sri Lanka Law College

to the Youth Parliament and to nominate him for the Youth Parliament of

2020.

36) For the said Youth Parliament, appointment of candidates has already

lapsed and for the year 2020 the Youth Parliament would have already

been appointed.

37) Therefore, at this stage there is no relief that can be granted in the instant

action.

38) In the said circumstances, I am of the view this application cannot be

maintained in this court under Writ Jurisdiction. The Petitioner should

have sought remedy at that stage from a different judicial forum.

39) In considering the said facts, I am not continuing with the other disputed

facts as the Petitioner cannot maintain this action.

CONCLUSION

40) In view of the aforesaid facts, I dismiss the petition dated 30th June 2020.

No cost ordered.
