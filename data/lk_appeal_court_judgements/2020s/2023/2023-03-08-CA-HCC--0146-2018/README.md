JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Director General of the Bribery Commission

in the High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo on the following

charges:

1. On or about the 03rd of January 2008 at Piliyandala the

Appellant being a Police Inspector attached to Piliyandala Police

Station, being employed for the detection and prosecution of

offenders, did solicit a gratification of Rs.10,000/- from a person

3 | P a g e

by the name of Haputantrige Jagath as an indument or reward

not to arrest and prosecute the said Haputantrige Jagath for

selling Cannabis and thereby committed an offence punishable

Under Section 16(b) of the Bribery Act.

2. At the same time and place and in the same transaction referred

to in the first charge, the Appellant being a public servant wit a

Police Inspector of Piliyandala Police Station, did solicit a

gratification in sum of Rs.10,000/- from Haputantrige Jagath

and thereby committed an offence punishable Under Section

19(c) of the Bribery Act.

3. On or about the 10th of June 2011 at Piliyandala the Appellant

being a Police Inspector attached to the Piliyandala Police

Station being employed for the detection and prosecution of

offenders did accept a gratification of Rs.10,000/- from a person

by the name of Haputantrige Jagath as an indument or reward

not to arrest and prosecute the said Haputantrige Jagath for

selling Cannabis and thereby committed an offence punishable

Under Section 16(b) of the Bribery Act.

4. At the same time and place and in the same transaction referred

to in the 3rd charge the Appellant being a public servant wit a

Police Inspector of Piliyandala Police Station, did accept a

gratification in sum of Rs.10,000/- from Haputantrige Jagath

and thereby committed an offence punishable Under Section

19(c) of the Bribery Act.

As the Appellant pleaded not guilty to the charges levelled against him, the

trial proceeded, and the prosecution had called five witnesses and closed

their case. As the prosecution had presented a prima facie case against the

Appellant, the Learned High Court Judge had called for the defence. After

making a statement from the dock, the Appellant had closed his case. After

4 | P a g e

considering the evidence presented by both parties, the Learned High Court

Judge had found the Appellant guilty on charges 02nd and 04th and has

imposed the following sentences on the Appellant on 24/05/2018:

1. For 2nd and 4th counts a fine of Rs.5,000/- each with a default

sentence of 01-month rigorous imprisonment imposed.

2. For 2nd and 4th counts 5 years rigorous imprisonment each was

imposed. Further the Learned High Court Judge has ordered the

sentence to run concurrent to each other.

3. In addition, a fine of Rs.10,000/- has been imposed with a

default sentence of 06 months rigorous imprisonment in terms

of Section 26 of the Bribery Act.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that

the Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to

the Covid 19 pandemic. At the hearing, the Appellant was present outside

the Court premises due to Covid 19 restrictions.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. Did the Learned High Court Judge fail to consider the items of evidence

which go to the testimonial trustworthiness of the prosecution

witnesses.

2. Even if the prosecution evidence is believed in toto, has the prosecution

proved that the Appellant solicited or accepted a gratification.

3. Has the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the contradictions

and omissions in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses according

to the law.

4. Has the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the matters

favourable to the Appellant.

5 | P a g e

5. Has the Learned High Court Judge by not considering the

contradictions and omissions as well as matters favourable to the

Appellant deprived the Appellant the substance of a fair trial.

6. Has the Learned High Court Judge not considered the dock statement

of the Appellant in accordance with the guidelines set out by Your

Lordships Court.

7. Has the prosecution not conducted the prosecution with a sense of

fairness required from the prosecution.

8. Has the Learned High Court Judge occasioned a miscarriage of justice

by not adequately considering the written submissions tendered on

behalf of the Appellant.

9. Has the Learned High Court Judge failed to take into consideration the

good character of the Appellant on respect of his testimonial

trustworthiness as well as his liability.

Background of the case.

According to PW1, he knew the Appellant as a police officer attached to

Piliyandala Police Station.PW1 was a small-scale Cannabis seller for which

he was arrested by the Appellant several times and was convicted for

trafficking Cannabis. The Appellant had used the witness as an informant to

track down large scale Cannabis traffickers. The Appellant had compromised

with the witness that he would not be arrested if PW1 provide information

about large scale Cannabis sellers. Due to this deal the Appellant and PW1

were in close contact with each other.

As the Appellant started to build a house, he had solicited Rs.10,000/- from

PW1. As he was not having enough money to meet the demand of the

Appellant, decided to complain to Bribery Commission. After the complaint,

the raid was organized by the Bribery officials. As per the prior arrangement,

PW1 with PW2 had gone to Kudamaduwa sub road to hand over the money

to the Appellant. PW2 is the decoy in this case. The Appellant had come to

Kudagamuwa sub road with another police officer named Sampath and

6 | P a g e

accepted the money from PW1. At that time, the police officer Sampath had

alerted the Appellant about a vehicle which had come to the scene. Having

thrown the money to a nearby paddy field, the duo had escaped from the

scene by a motor bike in which they had come to accept the money.

PW2, the decoy also confirmed the evidence given by PW1.

According to PW3, after the incident the Appellant was not to be traced on

the date of incident. He had surrendered to the court subsequently.

In a criminal trial, it is incumbent on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt. There is no burden on the Appellant to prove his

innocence. This is the Golden Thread that was discussed in Woolmington

v. DPP [1935] A.C.462. In this case Viscount Sankey J held that:

Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is

always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the

prisoners guilt If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there

is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the

prosecution or the prisoner...the prosecution has not made out the

case and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.

As the raised grounds of appeal are interconnected, all grounds will be

considered together in this appeal.

The assessment of the credibility of witnesses primarily depends on the

testimony given by them either for the prosecution or for the defence during

the examination-in-chief, cross examination and re-examination.

Additionally, the trial judges observation of the witnesses during their

testimony was very important in helping him reach his decision. In this case

the Learned High Court had considered the evidence of all the prosecution

witnesses, evaluated their evidence extensively and was satisfied himself that

their evidence passed the test of consistency and the test of probability.

7 | P a g e

The Appellant had used PW1 as a whistle blower to arrest large scale

narcotics dealers. Hence, the Appellant had not taken any action to stop

PW1s narcotics business. This shows their relationship was very cordial

without any animosity. Further, no contradiction or omission was marked

on the evidence of PW1, who is very important witness in this case.

In this case, it is common ground that the Appellant was a police officer

coming under category of a public servant. The prosecution had proven that

the Appellant being a public servant did solicit and accepted the gratification

as disclosed by PW1. The Appellant was found guilty of only the 2nd and the

4th counts after the Learned High Court Judge found the prosecutions

evidence to be very persuasive. The relevant portion of the judgment is re-

produced below:

After receiving the complaint from PW1, the Bribery Officials had

meticulously planned the raid. Although PW1, PW2 and PW3 were in three

places, their evidence is very well connected to each other. The Learned High

Court Judge in his judgment carefully considered the evidence led by both

parties to come to his conclusion. Hence, the Learned High Court had been

satisfied with the credibility of the witnesses who had given evidence on

behalf of the prosecution.

8 | P a g e

The Appellant admitted that he obtained the services of PW1 as an informant.

On the date of the incident, the Appellant had gone to Kudamaduwa where

he was building a house. According to him, he had received a call from PW1

regarding an information pertains to drugs. When he went and met the

complainant to obtain the information, he saw a van coming in that direction.

Having thought that this may be a trap to arrest him, he fled the scene

immediately with his pillion rider. He denied that he accepted any money on

that day as claimed by PW1.

On analysing the dock statement of the Appellant, he had gone to the place

of incident upon called by PW1 to pass an information. This clearly indicates

that good cooperation had existed between the Appellant and PW1. The

conduct of the Appellant after running away from the scene and not reporting

to his police station clearly strengthens the prosecutions story. Further

surrendering to court thorough an Attorney-at-law, further strengthens the

prosecutions version. Being an experienced police officer, he failed to even

to inform to his higher officers why he decided to surrender to the court. His

conduct has been highly suspicious in this case.

The conduct of the accused before and after the crime is also very relevant

as circumstantial evidence. From the circumstantial evidence available

before it, the court can draw inference and arrive at its conclusion.

Learned High Court Judge in his judgment has very extensively considered

the stand taken by the Appellant in his judgment. The Learned High Court

had given plausible reasons as to why he rejected the dock statement of the

Appellant. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

The Learned Presidents Counsel strenuously argued that the Learned High

Court Judge had failed to take into consideration the good character of the

Appellant.

In Gunawardena v. The Attorney General [1980] 2 SLR 25 the court held

that:

Where the evidence establishes the guilt of the accused beyond

reasonable doubt, it cannot be said that there was misdirection on the

part of the trial judge for failure to consider the evidence of good character

of the accused.

In this case the evidence presented by the prosecution is overwhelming. No

contradictory position existed among the prosecution witnesses. The

Learned High Court Judge had considered the inter se and per se

contradictions of prosecution witnesses and held that the prosecution had

adduced cogent, consistent, and believable evidence. Therefore, I conclude

that the grounds of appeal raised by the Appellant have no merit.

10 | P a g e

The prosecution had proven that the Appellant had committed the above-

mentioned wrongful acts not for the purpose of doing an official act but for

the preservation or abuse of official powers.

When considering the totality of the evidence, it is clear that the prosecution

has proven the 2nd and the 4th charges in the indictment against the

Appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

Therefore, the appeal is dismissed, and the conviction and the sentence are

affirmed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
