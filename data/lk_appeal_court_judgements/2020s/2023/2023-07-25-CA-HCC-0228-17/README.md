The Facts in Brief

The victim (PW01) was eighteen years of age when she gave evidence before the

High Court on 22-03-2012, some eight years after the alleged incidents.

She was studying at fifth grade in her school at the time these incidents

occurred. Her mother was deceased by that time, and she lived with her father,

his second wife and her younger sister. Her father was a farmer and his wife,

whom the victim referred to as the mother, used to leave the house early to

attend to their daily farming work, and the victim and her sister used to be

alone at home after they come from the school.

She knew the appellant well, as he was a neighbour, whom she identified as

uncle (mama) in her evidence. It was her evidence that the appellant used to

visit their house and was in the habit of sending her younger sister to the

nearby boutique to get toffee, and take her on to a bed inside the house and

commit sexual acts several times over a period of time. She has described the

acts as removing her clothes and having engaging in intercrural sex with her. It

has been her evidence that she was young at that time and is unable to

remember the incidents in much detail.

She has stated that she did not inform what was happening to her to anyone

because the appellant told her not to tell anyone and threatened her, but

informed one of her teachers when it became unbearable to her any longer. It

had been her evidence that these incidents happened at their house as well as

the house of the appellant as he used to take her to his house as well. She has

stated that she cannot remember the exact dates of the incidents, but gave a

statement to the police after she informed the teacher of the incidents and she

was subjected to a medical examination as well. According to the birth

certificate marked P-01, her date of birth was 07-08-1994.

Under cross-examination, the PW-01 has stated that these incidents happened

in the year 2004, but cannot remember the other details, and apart from the

Page 4 of 15

appellant, she was sexually abused by four other persons as well, during the

period.

After the complaint was made to the police, she has been sent under probation

care and had been under the care of the probation until 2011. She has also

been specific that she cannot identify the appellant by name since the

incidents occurred more than seven years ago, but it was the appellant who

committed the sexual abuse on her.

The prosecution has called the grandmother of the victim to testify in the Court

(PW-04). It had been her evidence that she came to know about the incidents

because her granddaughter has revealed them to her teacher at the school, and

she identified four persons namely, Piyasena, Premasiri, Adlin, and another

person called Kurun Mama as the persons who committed sexual abuse on

her. It was her evidence that she was informed of the incidents during the

Sinhala New Year period. It had been suggested to her by the defence that

because she and the parents of the children wanted them to be taken under

the care of the probation service, she concocted a false accusation against the

appellant and several others, which she has denied.

The prosecution has called witness PW-10 who was the doctor who examined

the victim child, where he has marked his Medico Legal Report as P-01. The

doctor has examined the child on 12-06-2004, and the child has related the

history of the incident to the doctor in the following manner.

.

.

The doctor has failed to observe any marks of sexual abuse on the child.

However, he has explained that given the history that the incident has taken

place one month prior to his examination of the child, any such marks may not

be visible after such time, and has expressed the opinion that due to the same

reason, there is no possibility of excluding such sexual abuse.

Page 5 of 15

Apart from the doctor, the prosecution has called two police officers who

conducted the investigations in relation to the incident. PW-08, retired Police

Inspector Ranaweera has gone to the scene of the alleged crime and recorded

his observations in addition to arresting the appellant as a suspect. He has

also instructed a subordinate officer to record the statement of the appellant.

According to his evidence, it was the two children who has pointed out where

the alleged crime took place.

PW-07 was the female police officer who has recorded the first complaint in

relation to the incident on 11-06-2004. She has received an information from

the Divisional Secretary of Tissamaharama. Thereafter, the Child Rights

Development Officer and the Grama Niladhari of the area has come and given

the first complaint to the police. When she and the other police team visited the

scene of the crime, the relevant children were at school and the female police

officer has taken steps to inform the school principal and get down the children

to their house, where she has recorded their statements. She has also taken

steps to admit the children to the hospital. The official witnesses have referred

to two children in their evidence, meaning the victim child and her younger

sister.

After the prosecution closed its case, the learned trial Judge has decided to call

for a defence, where the appellant had made a dock statement and had also

called a witness to testify on his behalf.

In his statement from the dock, the appellant has claimed that this is a false

complaint against him. It was his stand that the complaining party wanted the

children to be admitted under the probation care, and to achieve their target,

they have falsified a story against them. The appellant has apparently referred

to him and the other persons against whom the victim child has made the

allegation of sexual abuse. He has stated that the childrens grandmother

wanted to admit the children under probation care. When her initial attempts

Page 6 of 15

failed, she was the person who was instrumental in making false allegations

against him was his position. He has denied the charges against him.

Hewabattage Sunil, who has given evidence on behalf of the appellant, has

claimed that the children did not attend school and Somawathi, who is the

grandmother of the children wanted the children to be sent under probation

care. However, he has stated that he came to know about the sexual abuse

complaints against the appellant as well as several others, but he is unaware of

any details. He has admitted that he came to give evidence because he thought

that the appellant did not commit any crime.

Pronouncing his judgement on 31-08-2017, the learned High Court Judge

found that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt

against the appellant. In the process of analyzing the evidence, the learned

High Court Judge has decided that the evidence of the victim has been

sufficiently corroborated and there was no basis to consider that the victim

child or her grandmother has made a false complaint against the appellant. He

has rejected the argument of the defence that the victim has failed to identify

the appellant as the perpetrator. The learned High Court Judge has justified

the reasons for the doctor being unable to observe any visible evidence of

sexual abuse, but has relied on the evidence where the doctor has stated that

such grave sexual abuse cannot be overruled.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. The error in law by applying the negative aspect of medical evidence

as corroborative or supportive of the prosecution evidence.

2. The charges in the indictment does not specify a date but states only

a period, however the prosecution failed to lead evidence regarding

that period either.

Page 7 of 15

3. The identification of the appellant was not sufficient to convict him.

4. Some findings in the judgement does not support by evidence.

5. The defence evidence had not been considered and evaluated

properly.

Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal

As the 2nd ground of appeal is a ground of appeal relating to the date of offence

as mentioned in the charges preferred against the appellant on the basis that it

was not proved, I will now proceed to consider the 2nd ground of appeal before

considering the other grounds urged.

In the indictment, the prosecution has mentioned that the three instances of

grave sexual abuse were committed during a period of 2 months. That is to say

between 11th April 2004 and 11th June 2004. It was the contention of the

learned Counsel for the appellant that the victim has failed to give evidence in

that regard, but has stated that the complaint was made in the year 2004. She

has failed to mention dates or months. Even the grandmother (PW-04) has

failed to come out with any specific dates of the alleged offences was the

contention. It was the position of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the

relevant complaint has been made on 11th June 2004 and there was no basis

to conclude from the evidence placed before the trial Court that the offences

took place during the time period mentioned in the said charges.

It is clear from the evidence of the victim that when she faced these incidents of

grave sexual abuse, she was studying in grade 5 of her school. The doctor has

given her age as 10 years old in his MLR. The evidence of the victim clearly

shows that the perpetrator of this crime has used the young age of the victim

and her family situation to his advantage. The victim child who was without

her natural mother has only revealed these abuses to her teachers at school,

which has led to a complaint being made in this regard to the police. The said

complaint had been made on the 11th of June 2004.

Page 8 of 15

The victim in her evidence says that she can only remember the year as 2004,

but cannot remember the months or dates of the incidents due to her young

age, but has stated that she can remember that these incidents took place after

the New Year period of 2004. The victim in her history given to the doctor has

stated that these incidents happened about a month prior to the medical

examination, which may be the reason why the prosecution has decided to

mention a period of two months before the date of the complaint to the police

as the relevant period of the incidents.

The importance of proving a date mentioned in a charge was sufficiently

discussed in the case of R. Vs. Dossi (1918) 13 Cr.App.R. at 158;

The indictment charged the accused with indecently assaulting an 11-

year-old girl on 19th March 1918. The child gave sworn testimony at the

trial and the trial Judge invoked the rule of practice that it would be

dangerous to convict absent corroboration. The accused provided alibi

evidence for 19th March 1918, but could not do so for any other day in

March. The child gave no evidence of a specific date but referred to

constant acts of indecency over a considerable period of time ending at

some date in March 1918.

The jury found the accused not guilty of the offence on the date alleged.

The Crown then amended the indictment to read on some day in

March, whereupon, the jury found the accused guilty. The conviction

was upheld on appeal,

Per Atkin, J. at page 159;

From time in memorial a date specified in an indictment has never

been a material matter unless it is actually an essential part of the

alleged offence.

Page 9 of 15

He continued at page 160;

Thus, though the date of the offence should be alleged in the

indictment, it has never been necessary that it should be laid

according to truth unless time is of the essence of the offence. It

follows, therefore, that the jury were entitled, if there was evidence

on which they could come to that conclusion, to find the appellant

guilty of the offence charged against him, even though they found

that it had not been committed on the actual date specified in the

indictment.

It is clear from the above authority as well as several other authorities that

followed, the date of the offence need not be proven in order for a conviction to

result, unless time is an essential element of the offence.

In the matter under appeal, the position taken up by the appellant was a

complete denial where the contention was that the grandmother and the other

family members of the victim child has concocted a story against the appellant

in order to send the victim and her sister under probation care.

Therefore, it is the view of this Court that the exact date of offence is not an

essential element when it comes to the facts of this matter.

Although it was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that

even the time period mentioned in the indictment has not been proved by the

prosecution, I am not in a position to agree. The victim child has given clear

evidence to state that she had to face these incidents of grave sexual abuse in

the year 2004 and after the New Year period. She has complained to her school

teacher as she no longer could bear the abuse faced by her, which may have

resulted in them reporting this to the Child Rights Development Officer of the

relevant Divisional Secretarys office. Through the officer, a complaint has been

lodged on 11th June 2004.

Page 10 of 15

This is the end date mentioned in the indictment. The child has mentioned to

the doctor who examined her that these incidents happened about a month

prior to his examination, which may be the reason why the prosecution has

decided to give a period of two months before the complaint made to the police

as the relevant period.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no merit in the ground of appeal

where it was argued that the prosecution has failed to establish the period of

offence before the Court.

I will now proceed to consider the other 4 grounds of appeal urged by the

appellant cumulatively, as they are interrelated, and since the relevant legal

principles have to be considered together.

It was the argument of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the

prosecution has failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish the appellants

identity as the perpetrator of the crime. However, it is my view that the

question of identity was never in doubt in this matter. The victim has given

clear evidence in the Court to say that the appellant was well known to her

since he is a person living near their house. Although she was unable to name

him, when she gave evidence, that does not mean that the identity of the

appellant was unknown to the victim. She has given evidence some 8 years

after the incident and 7 years after she left the village to live under probation

care.

Under the circumstances, her being unable to identify the appellant by his

name is not a matter that has to be taken as a matter that creates a doubt as

to the appellants identity.

When the victim was taken before the doctor, the doctor has recorded in the

history part of the MLR stating the victim revealed several names, inclusive of

the name of the appellant as persons who committed grave sexual abuse on

her. That fact is also consistent with the evidence of the victim child in Court.

Page 11 of 15

Under the circumstances, it can be safely assumed that she has forgotten the

name of the appellant, as she was away from her village for over several years

before she came and gave evidence in the Court.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant was that the learned

High Court Judge has considered the negative aspects of the MLR marked P-01

to consider it as corroboration of the evidence of the victim.

In his judgement, the learned High Court Judge has considered the evidence of

the doctor (PW-10) as a witness called by the prosecution to corroborate the

evidence of PW-01 who was the victim. The doctors evidence had been that he

could not observe any visible signs of sexual abuse because the alleged

offences had taken place around a month before the victim child was examined

by him. However, the doctor has stated that there is no possibility for him to

rule out such grave sexual abuses, merely because there were no visible signs

observed on the child.

The evidence of the doctor does not corroborate the evidence of PW-01 because

there had not been visible signs of grave sexual abuse. However, the doctors

evidence cannot be disregarded on that fact alone. The doctor being an expert

witness can express only an opinion as to his examination of the victim child.

As there is a provision for him to record the history given by a victim and

produce it as part of the MLR, such history, if relevant, can be considered to

measure the consistency or the inconsistency of an evidence of a victim in a

grave sexual abuse, rape, or any other matter at a trial.

Although the learned High Court Judge has not mentioned that he is

considering the medical evidence to test the consistency of the victims

evidence, it is my considered view that there was no error of law by the learned

High Court Judge in the manner he considered the medical evidence placed

before the Court.

Page 12 of 15

The learned Counsel for the appellant contented that the learned High Court

Judge has considered some of the facts, which are not part of the evidence at

page 4 of the judgement (page 152 of the appeal brief).

The learned High Court Judge has said that at the time relevant to these

incidents, the father of the victim child was dead. Whereas, it was the mother

of the child who was dead at that time.

Similarly, it was contended that the victim in her evidence stated that the

appellant removed only her undergarments before committing the crime but

the learned High Court Judge has determined that he removed all the clothes

worn by the victim. To be fair by the learned High Court Judge, it needs to be

stated that the victim child has initially stated that after taking her to the bed

inside their house, the appellant removed her clothes. However, when probing

further, she has stated that he removed her undergarment.

For such a misdirection as to the facts to become relevant, such misdirection

should have the effect of causing a prejudice to the appellant. I find no

prejudice whatsoever, because of the mentioned two misdirections by the

learned High Court Judge when analyzing the evidence, as they are not

material misdirections as to the facts.

In his 5th ground of appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant contended

that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider and evaluate the

evidence of the defence properly.

However, I have no basis to agree with that contention as well. The learned

High Court Judge has considered the essence of the dock statement made by

the appellant giving it the necessary value of a statement made by an accused

person without subjecting himself to an oath or test of cross-examination.

The appellants position had been that the grandmother of the victim made up

a false story in order to send the children under the probation care. However, it

becomes abundantly clear from the evidence led at this trial that the

Page 13 of 15

grandmother or the parents of the child were unaware of these grave sexual

abuse incidents until the police along with the officials of the Divisional

Secretarys office came looking for them to their house.

Although the witness called by the defendant on behalf of him had stated that

the children were not attending school, even at the time of the relevant officials

came to the house, they had been at school, and police evidence clearly

establishes the fact that they got down the children from the school in order to

record their statements.

The witness called on behalf of the defendant has not stated anything that

creates a doubt in relation to the evidence of the prosecution. He has merely

stated that because he believes that the appellant has not done anything

wrong, he came to give evidence on his behalf. He has stated further, that he is

unable to state anything in relation to the alleged incidents of grave sexual

abuse.

I find that the above matters had drawn the attention of the learned High Court

Judge, and based on due consideration, the learned High Court Judge has

decided to reject the defence put forward by the appellant.

In this matter, apart from the evidence of the victim child, there had been no

eyewitness account of the incidents on grave sexual abuse, and the incidents of

grave sexual abuse had been reported with a delay, which has been well

explained by the victim child in her evidence.

As considered, correctly by the learned High Court Judge there was no reason

before the trial Court to doubt the evidence of the victim, although there were

no eyewitness accounts to corroborate her evidence.

In a trial of this nature, what matters is the credibility and trustworthiness of a

witness, and not the number of witnesses called on behalf of the prosecution.

Page 14 of 15

In terms of section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance,

No particular number of witnesses shall be in any case required for

the proof of any fact.

The Indian Supreme Court in the case of Bhoginbhai Hirijibhai Vs. State of

Gujarat (1983) A.I.R. SC 753 held;

In the Indian setting refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual

assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding insult to the

injury.

It was held in the case of D. Tikiri Banda Vs. Honourable Attorney General,

Bar Association Law Reports 210 (B.L.R.) at 92;

(a) If delay of making a statement is explainable, the evidence of a

witness should not be rejected on that ground alone.

(b) When the medical report is consistent with the version of a sexually

abused victim, it can be taken as evidence consistent and thus form

to some extent corroboration and is admissible under section 157 of

the Evidence Ordinance (although that may not be corroboration in

the strict sense)

(c) Mostly the victims of sexual harassment prefer not to talk about the

harrowing experience and would like to forget about the incident as

soon as possible (withdrawal symptom) the offenders should not be

allowed to capitalize or take mean advantage of these natural inherent

weaknesses of small children.

(d) Insignificant omission of such a victim or her utterance of dreadful

words should not be taken as a contradiction having effect and impact

of the credibly of the victim.

(g) If the evidence of the victim could be relied on, is trustworthy, firm

etc. there is no impediment on the part of the Court in acting solely on

Page 15 of 15

the evidence of the victim and it is only when the evidence of the victim

suffers from some infirmity or where the Court believe that it would not

be prudent to base a conviction solely on that evidence, the Court should

look for corroboration.

Although there had been some misdirections as to the facts and the law by the

learned High Court Judge in the judgement, I am in no position to consider

that those misdirections had prejudiced the substantial rights of the appellant

or occasioned a failure of justice as considered above.

In the proviso to the Article 138 of The Constitution which provides jurisdiction

for the Court of Appeal to exercise its appellate jurisdiction, reads thus;

Provided that no judgement, decree or order of any Court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which

has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasion a

failure of justice.

For the above-mentioned reasons, I find no merit in the appeal preferred by the

appellant challenging his conviction and the sentence. Accordingly, the appeal

is dismissed for want of merit. The conviction and the sentence dated 31st

August 2017 affirmed.

Having considered the fact that the accused-appellant had been in

incarceration from the date of his sentence, it is ordered that the sentence

should deem to have taken effect from the date of sentence, namely 31-08-

2017.
