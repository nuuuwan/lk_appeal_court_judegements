MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeal has been lodged to set aside the judgment and

sentence dated 19.7.2019 by the High Court of Vavuniya.

The accused appellant had been indicted on 4 counts and they are,

1) for committing rape under section 364 (2) of the Penal Code between

1.12.2015 to 15.1.2015

2) for commuting an offence under section 345 of the Penal Code on

15.12.2015,

3) for committing an offence under section 364 (2) of the Penal Code

between 15.12.2015 to 23 .12.2015,

4) for committing an offence of rape under section 364 of the Peal Code

between 15.12.2015 to 23.12.2015.

The appellant had pleaded guilty and upon the conclusion of the trial

the learned High Court Judge had convicted the appellant for all counts

and had imposed a sentence of 27 years in totality with the sentence

for the first charge to be served first and the second subsequently and

Page 3 of 4

the sentences for the third and the fourth to be served concurrently but

subsequent to the 1st and the second sentences for the respective

charges.

At the stage of argument, the Counsel appearing for the appellant

stated that he is only canvassing the sentence and not the conviction

imposed by the learned High Court Judge. He further averred that the

sentence in totality is excessive and the Counsel of both sides

weregiven a chance to make submissions in mitigation before the

sentencing.

The learned Counsel for the respondents conceded the fact that the

sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge is excessive but he

brought to the notice of Court that the victim at the time was 15 years

and the appellant at the time of the offence was 25 years of age and

was married and was a father.

Upon considering the submissions of both parties this Court is of the

opinion that the learned High Court Judge had failed to give an

opportunity for both parties to make submissions in mitigation which

has deprived the appellant of pleading for the mercy of Court before

sentencing.

Hence the rigorous imprisonments imposed on the appellant is varied

as below,

1) For the 1st count 10 years rigorous imprisonment ordered , 2) For the second count 1 years rigorous imprisonment ordered, 3) For the third count 10 years rigorous imprisonment ordered, 4) For the fourth count 10 years rigorous imprisonment ordered,

and the sentences to be back dated to the date of the conviction

and the sentences pertaining to the terms of imprisonment of all

charges to run concurrently. The rest of the sentences of fine and

compensation to remain the same, subject to the above variation

the instant appeal is dismissed.
