P.Kumararatnam,J.

The Petitioner filing this Application has invoked the revisionary

jurisdiction of this Court to revise the order of the Learned High Court

Judge dated 28/07/2022 and to grant bail to her husband who is the

Accused in this case upon suitable condition as this Court considers

appropriate.

The Accused was arrested on 25.02.2020 by the Police officers attached

to Police Narcotics Bureau, Colombo-01. He was produced before the

Magistrate of Mount Lavinia in the case bearing No. B/722//2020.Four

persons including the Accused were arrested on that day and Accused

was the 2nd Suspect named in the B report.

The Accused was arrested upon an information provided by the 1st

Suspect named in the B report. The 1st Suspect who was a Maldivian

National was arrested with 3.03 Kilograms of substances suspected to

be Heroin first on 25.02. 2020.Upon interrogation the Accused was

arrested with possession of 01.10 Kilograms of substance believed to

Heroin. Upon further investigation the detectives arrested 3rd and 4th

Suspects subsequently on the charge of aiding and abetting drugs.

The Accused and the Suspects were produced and facts were reported

to the Colombo Magistrate under Sections 54A (d) and (b) of the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the

Act No.13 of 1984.

The production had been sent to the Government Analyst Department

and after analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded the report to

the Mount Lavinia Magistrate Court. According to the Government

Analyst, 225.1 grams of pure Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) had been

detected from the substance recovered from the Accused and 600

grams of pure Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) had been detected from the

substance recovered from the 1st Suspect.

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in

support of her Revision Application.

1. Court has granted bail for the principal suspect arrested on the

same day with 3.03 Kilograms of Heroin, on 09.12.2021 on the

basis of delay of sending out indictment, statement given under

the provisions of 127 of the Criminal Procedure Code and several

other factors.

CA(PHC)APN BAIL 97-2023

2. The prosecution version is not credible, and the Accused has

been falsely implicated.

3. The 3rd and 4th Suspects arrested along with the Accused and the

1st Suspect were discharged from the proceedings by the Hon.

Attorney General.

4. The 1st Suspect has made a statement under section 127 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act describing manner in which the

incident or rather how the arrest has been made by the Police

Narcotics Bureau.

5. The Accused is the sole breadwinner of the family and the child is

a child with special requirements.

6. The Accused himself is a patient suffering from number of

ailments.

7. The Accused is in remand for about 30 months as at today.

The Learned State Counsel submitted that the delay is not an

exceptional circumstance to be considered to enlarge the suspect on

bail. Further, the time spent for preparing the indictment does not

constitute an exceptional circumstance. According to the State,

indictment has already been forwarded to the High Court of Colombo

and pre-trial was over and the case is fixed for trial now.

The suspect is in remand nearly about 30 months. According to

Government Analyst Report the pure quantity of Heroin detected is

225.1 grams.

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what

is exceptional circumstances must be considered on its own facts and

circumstances on a case-by-case basis.

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

CA(PHC)APN BAIL 97-2023

In CA(PHC)APN 107/2018 decided on 19.03.2019 the court held that

remanding for a period of one year and five months without being

served with the in indictment was considered inter alia in releasing the

suspect on bail. According to the Petitioner, at present her family is

going through untold hardship without proper income and care.

The Section 83 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act

which was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states:

83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under

sections 54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail

by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 84 and 85, a person

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A

and section 54B-

(a) of which the pure quantity of the dangerous drug, trafficked,

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A;

and

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment, shall not

be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in exceptional

circumstances.

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in

exceptional circumstances.

The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner urged this Court to consider that

detaining a suspect without any legal action for an extended period of

time amounts to a violation of his fundamental rights which can be

considered as an exceptional ground.

CA(PHC)APN BAIL 97-2023

The Learned Counsel brought the attention of this Court as to how the

other Suspects arrested along with the Accused were granted bail by

the Learned High Court Judges who heard their respective bail

application.

According to the police investigation the 1st Suspect is the prime

suspect in this case. The pure quantity of Heroin recovered from his

possession is 600 grams. But he was granted bail on 09.12. 2021.The

Learned High Court after taking into account the delay in remand

custody and the 127-statement made under the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act the regarding the manner of his arrest by the police has

granted bail to him.

But the Learned High Court Judge who heard the bail application of the

Accused has failed to consider the delay as an exceptional

circumstance.

Further, the 3rd and 4th Suspects who were produced in this case have

been granted bail well before their discharge by the Hon. Attorney

General.

The Government Analyst Report pertaining to this case has been

received by the Magistrate Court on 20.08.2020. The indictment was

sent to the High Court of Colombo after 14 months of the receipt of the

Government Analyst Report by the Magistrate Court.

Although more than three years passed after the arrest of the Accused,

the trial has not commenced in the High Court of Colombo. According

to the bail refusal order of Learned High Court Judge dated 28.07.2022

the refusal of bail based on non-submission of exceptional

circumstances by the Accused. Although on the same day the Learned

High Court Judge has concluded the pre-trial conference and fixed the

case for trial, after passing one year of the order, the trial has not

commenced as at today.

CA(PHC)APN BAIL 97-2023

In Nasher v. Director of Public Prosecution [2020] VSCA 144 the

court held that:

a combination of delay, onerous custodial conditions, and the

relative weakness of the prosecution case may, when considered

with all relevant circumstances, compel the conclusion that

exceptional circumstances have been established. [Emphasis added]

The right to trial without undue delay is found in numerous

international and regional human rights instruments; for example, the

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 14(3)(c), the

American Convention on Human Rights (Article 8(1), the African

Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (Article 7(1)(d), and the

European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and

Fundamental Freedoms (Article 6(1).

When a person is kept in remand without taking his or her case for trial

for a considerable period of time, he or she should be released on bail

pending trial. Otherwise, this will lead not only to prison overcrowding

but also violates his or her fundamental rights which have been

guaranteed under the Constitution.

Hence, I consider the delay more than three years in remand falls into

the category of excessive and oppressive delay considering the

circumstances of this case. Hence, considering all the circumstances of

this case, the suspect has very good exceptional circumstances to

consider this application in his favour. Further, remanding a suspect

without commencing his or her trial will prejudice his or her rights and

family as well.

Offences under Section 54A(d) and 54A(b) of the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is no

doubt serious offences but seriousness of the offence alone cannot form

CA(PHC)APN BAIL 97-2023

a ground to refuse bail. In considering these matters, the court must

bear in mind the presumption of innocence.

Further, bail should never be withheld as punishment. Granting of bail

is primarily at the discretion of the Courts. The discretion should be

exercised with due care and caution taking into account the facts and

circumstances of each case.

Considering all these factors into account, especially the pure quantity

of Heroin detected and the circumstances of the case, I consider this an

appropriate case to revise the order of the Learned High Court Judge

dated 28.07.2022 and grant bail to the Accused. Hence, I order the

Accused be granted bail with following strict conditions.

1. Cash bail of Rs.100,000/=.

2. To provide 02 sureties. They must sign a bond of two million

each.

3. The Accused and the sureties must reside in the address given

until conclusion of his case.

4. Not to approach any prosecution witnesses directly or indirectly

or to interfere with.

5. To surrender his passport if any, to court and not to apply for a

travel document. The Controller of the Immigration and

Emigration is informed of the travel ban on the Accused.

6. To report to the Police Narcotics Bureau, Colomb-01 on the last

Sunday of every month between 9am to 1pm.

7. Any breach of these conditions is likely to result in the

cancellation of his bail.

The Revision Application is allowed and the Learned High Court Judge

of Colombo is hereby directed to enlarge the Accused on bail on the

above bail conditions.
