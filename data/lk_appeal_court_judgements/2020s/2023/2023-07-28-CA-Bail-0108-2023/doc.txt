ORDER

P.Kumararatnam,J.

The Suspect-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) who is

the 1st Suspect named in M.C.Negombo Case No. M 50768 had applied

for bail in terms of Section 83(2) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Amendment Act No 41 of 2022.

CA Bail 108-2023

3 | P a g e

On 06.06.2022, the Petitioner was arrested at Negombo by officers

attached to the Negombo Police Station when they were at a roadblock.

It has been alleged that while the Petitioner was travelling as a pillion

rider, on a Motor Bike bearing No.WP BHQ 1915 driven by another

person, near a temple at Wellaweediya, Negombo when police checked

her hand bag found a parcel with some substance which reacted for

Heroin. The substance recovered from the Petitioner weighed about

75.100 grams.

The suspect was produced and facts were reported to the Negombo

Magistrate under Section 54A (1) (b) and (d) and of the Poisons, Opium

and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984

and a detention order was obtained for further investigations under

Section 82(3) of the said Act.

The production had been sent to the Government Analyst Department

on 07/06/2022. After analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded

the report to Court on 09/01/2023. According to the Government

Analyst, 38.75 grams of pure Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) had been

detected from the substance sent for the analysis.

The Petitioner is 52 years old, married and mother of three children.

She has two matters pending before the High Court and one matter

pending before the Magistrate Court. She has been incarcerated for

nearly one year.

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in

support of her bail Application.

1. No drugs were found in her possession of the Petitioner when she

was arrested by the police officers.

2. The Petitioner had been in remand nearly year.

The State opposing to bail submitted that when the police signalled to

stop the motor bike in which the Petitioner travelled, the rider had tried

to escape without stopping the bike. The police had to use minimum

force to stop the bike at that time. As the conduct of the Petitioner and

the rider become suspicious, the police checked her hand bag and

found the contraband from her possession.

The Learned State Counsel further submitted that the delay is not an

exceptional circumstance to be considered to enlarge the suspect on

bail.

The suspect is in remand for nearly about one year. According to

Government Analyst Report, the pure quantity of Heroin detected from

the possession of 1st Accused is 38.75 grams.

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what

is exceptional circumstances must be considered on its own facts and

circumstances on a case by case.

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

The Section 83 of the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act

which was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states:

83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under

sections 54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail

by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 84 and 85, a person

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A

and section 54B-

(a) of which the pure quantity of the dangerous drug, trafficked,

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A;

and

CA Bail 108-2023

5 | P a g e

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment,

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in

exceptional circumstances.

In this case, the pure quantity of Heroin detected in the production by

the Government Analyst is 38.75 grams. Hence, this court has

jurisdiction to consider granting of bail as per the new amendment.

The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that although it is

alleged that the Heroin parcel was recovered from inside the hand bag

of the Petitioner, there was no reference in the B report to the effect that

the said hand bag was in the exclusive possession of the Petitioner at

the time of detection.

I agree with the learned State Counsel that the factual and evidentiary

matters pertain to the investigations can only be tested at the trial upon

the witnesses being cross examined and shall not be tested at the time

of hearing this bail application considering the nature of this case.

Further, I do not consider the delay nearly about one year in remand

falls into the category of excessive and oppressive delay considering the

circumstances of this case.

The Offence under Section 54A(b) and (d) of the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is a

serious offence and the seriousness of the offence should be considered

when bail is considered.

In this case the pure Heroin detected is 38.75 grams, which certainly a

commercial quantity. Considering the seriousness of the sentence

prescribed under the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance,

there is a high risk of absconding.

At present the Government Analyst Report is received by the Court and

the Hon. Attorney General will call for the investigation notes in due

CA Bail 108-2023

course. Hence, it is prudent to send out the indictment against the

Petitioner to the High Court without further delay and expedite the trial.

Considering all these factors into account, especially the pure quantity

of Heroin detected, the charge going to be against the Petitioner, the

pending cases in the High Court and in the Magistrate Court and other

circumstances of the case, I consider this is not an appropriate case to

grant bail to the Petitioner. Hence, I refuse to release the Petitioner on

bail.

Hence, the bail application is hereby dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this order to the

Magistrate Court of Negombo and the Headquarters Inspector, Police

Station, Negombo.
