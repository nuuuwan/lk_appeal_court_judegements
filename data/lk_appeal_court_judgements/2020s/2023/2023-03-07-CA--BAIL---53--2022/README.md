Argued on: 30.01.2023

Decided on: 07.03.2023

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to obtain bail to the suspect

namely Don Sakya Sri Athalage under the provisions of the Assistance

to and Protection of Victims of crime and Witnesses act.

The suspect an Ordinary Level student had been having affair with

Tharushi Dulanjali Rajapakse who alleges that the suspect had sexually

abused her on 27.2.2019. He had been produced before the Magistrate

on those charges and the Magistrate had called for a probation officers

report which had said that the victim and the suspect had been having a

romantic relationship, and the Magistrate taking in to consideration the

facts in the said report had enlarged the suspect on bail on 16.7.2021.

But on 19.7.2021 the aggrieved party had filed a motion in Court that

the suspect had threatened the victim while leaving the Court premises

being released on bail.

But consequently the victim had eloped with the suspect and had been

living with the suspect and after the victim returned home action had

been filed against the petitioner under the instant act on 11.7.2022 and

he had been remanded.

The Counsel for the suspect urged this Court to consider the young age

of the suspect and the fact that the instant matter is a fabrication of the

victims parents.

The State Counsel appearing for the respondents objected to the

application but relevant Ibes have not been received by the

respondents and any meaningful action had not been taken against the

suspect.

The law pertaining to this matter is that a suspect produced and

remanded under this act can be granted bail only upon exceptional

circumstances by the Court of Appeal, and the term exceptional has not

been defined in the act but our legal literature has held that

exceptionality has to be determined by the facts of each case.

The Counsel for the suspect further averred to the document marked as

P6 in the brief which is undated which is supposed to be written by the

victim in which she had elaborated the romantic relationship she had

been having with the suspect and the pressure she had undergone from

the parents to stop the affair.

Hence having considered the submissions of both parties we are of the

opinion that it is only but faire to allow the instant application for bail.

As such the instant application for bail is allowed and we direct the

learned Magistrate to enlarge the above named suspect on suitable

conditions of bail.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
