ORDER ON PRLIMINAY OBJECTION

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

In this application, the petitioner sought a Writ of Certiorari to quash

the grant/permit bearing number 386223 issued to the 5th respondent

by the 1st respondent. Also, the petitioner sought a Writ of Mandamus

to the 1st to 4th respondents to conduct a fair prior investigation and

issue a grant/permit to the petitioner for the land subject to this

application.

The original petition was filed on 26th September 2019, and the

amended petition was filed on 18th February 2020. The 1st to 4th, and

9th respondents have filed their statement of objections. The 5th

respondent has filed a separate statement of objections. Subsequently,

the counter affidavit was filed by the petitioner. At the hearing of the

application, the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the 1st to 4th, and

the 9th respondents raised a preliminary objection. Parties were allowed

to tender written submissions on the preliminary objection.

Accordingly, written submissions were filed on behalf of the petitioner,

the 1st to 4th and 9th respondents and the 5th respondent. The 5th

Page 5 of 10

respondent is also asking to dismiss the application in limine on the

preliminary objection raised by the learned Deputy Solicitor General.

The preliminary objection is that the petitioner does not have locus

standi to have and maintain this application. The said preliminary

objection is based on following two grounds.

I. The parties who transferred the State Land to the petitioner did

not have title to transfer the same and therefore, the petitioner

cannot claim from the State, since the State has not created any

legitimate expectation to the petitioner.

II. Without prejudice to that position, in terms of the Land

Development Ordinance (hereinafter referred to as the LDO,

all the transactions that the petitioner relied upon are null and

void by the operation of the law.

Briefly, the facts of the case are as follows:

The land subject to this application belongs to 5th and 6th respondents,

Herath Mudiyanselage Lalani Piyasena and Rajapakse Devage Sarath

Kumara, husband and wife. The petitioner stated in his petition that

they had been in physical possession of the land for a long time and

they did not have any permit issued by the government. They have

transferred the land to one Samarakkodi Arachchige Shiran Charu

Wimukthi (7th respondent) for Rs.1,500,000/- under improper

circumstances, according to the petition. With the adjoining land, the

7th respondent transferred the land in question to the petitioner for a

sum of Rs. 4,500,000/- by executing a transfer agreement, according

to the petitioner. Subsequently, some dispute arose in respect of this

land and a case under Section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act

was filed in the Magistrate Court of Wellawaya. The petitioner stated

that on the directions of the learned Magistrate of Wellawaya, the

Divisional Secretary issued a permit bearing number 386223 dated 24th

July 2018 to Lalani Piyasena, the 5th respondent. Now, the petitioner

Page 6 of 10

seeks, by this application, to quash the said permit and to issue a

permit in his name.

According to the aforesaid averments of the petition, at the time of the

land being transferred to the petitioner, the land belonged to the State.

It is stated in the petition that transfer took place on 04th January 2018

and the permit was issued to the 5th respondent on 24th July 2018.

(According to the permit bearing number 386223, marked P-10, the

date on which the permit was issued is 2018.2.24.) Even in an occasion

where a permit has been issued to a person under the Land

Development Ordinance in respect of state land, the land still belongs

to the state. In the event of failure to comply with any of the conditions

contained in the permit, the permit could be cancelled. However, even

on the date, the transfer agreement was executed in order to transfer

the land to the petitioner, a permit had not been issued for this land to

anybody. Hence, undisputedly, the subject matter of this application is

a state land.

In the written submission tendered by the petitioner for the preliminary

objection, it is stated that the petitioner possessed and cultivated the

land without any disturbance since 4th January 2018 and in or about

February 2019, the 5th respondent forcibly entered the land and built a

house with clay. The petitioners response to the preliminary objection

was that the 5th respondent did not come forward for a long time to

claim her right and 5th and 6th respondents have sold this property to

the 7th respondent some time ago. Therefore, the petitioner states in the

conclusion of his written submission that the 1st to 4th respondents

have neglected their authority by issuing a permit for the sold

government land.

Before considering the other matters, it is to be noted that the

government has not sold this land to anybody. Hence, this is not a sold

government land. Nobody else can sell state land except the state. In

addition, for state land, the Divisional Secretary can issue a permit to

Page 7 of 10

a suitable person according to the law. Therefore, the aforesaid

contention that the 1st to 4th respondents have neglected their authority

by issuing a permit for the sold government land has no merit.

Section 161 of the Land Development Ordinance states that No person

shall, by possession of any land alienated on a permit, acquire any

prescriptive title thereto against any other person or against the State.

So, even a permit holder cannot get a prescriptive title to a state land

by possessing the land for a long period of time.

Section 162 of the land Development Ordinance as amended by Act

No.16 of 1969 reads as follows:

162(1) A notary shall not attest any instrument operating as a

disposition of a holding which contravenes the provisions of this

Ordinance.

162(2) An instrument executed or attested in contravention of the

provisions of this section shall be null and void..

Although, a transfer agreement, P-6 has been executed by Mr. M.K.M

Farouk, Attorney-at-Law and Notary Public to transfer the state land to

the petitioner on a consideration, the notary is not entitled by law to

execute this transfer agreement for the land owned by the state. The 5th

respondent, Lalani Piyasena or the 7th respondent, Shiran Charu, both

of whom could not acquire prescriptive title to this state land and could

not execute any instrument to transfer the land owned by the state.

Therefore, the 7th respondent does not get any title to the land in

question, although the notary has stated in the transfer agreement that

the vendor (the 7th respondent) obtained ownership by possessing the

land more than ten years. The notary who executed the transfer

agreement should know that ownership could not be claimed for a state

land on prescription.

Page 8 of 10

The transfer agreement P-6 is an instrument operating as a disposition

of the property in question. Therefore, the transfer agreement executed

by the notary on the basis that the 7th respondent acquired title to the

state land by long term possession is null and void according to Section

162(2) of the LDO. In terms of Section 163 of the LDO, a notary who

knowingly attests any deed in breach of the provisions of Section 162

shall be guilty of an offence.

Now, the issue is whether the petitioner, who has no title or right

whatsoever to this land, has the locus standi to maintain this

application. In our country, the law has developed to the extent that if

any kind of legal right or interest is affected by administrative action,

that person can seek redress by way of an application of writ. In the

case of Fernando, The Conservator of Forests and two others v.

Timberlake International Pvt Ltd and another (2010) 1 Sri L.R.

326 at pages 352, 353, it was observed that Sri Lankan courts have

shown an increasing willingness to open out their jurisdiction to

whoever whose interests are affected by administrative action,.

In the case at hand, the petitioner cannot have any interest in the land

in question because it is state-owned property and the petitioner does

not have any legal right to the property. Any person whose interests are

affected by administrative action has locus standi to maintain a writ

application. The aforementioned "interests" do not mean an interest

arising from activities done contrary to the law. As the petitioner stated,

in this application, he has given consideration to the 7th respondent to

obtain the ownership of a state land to which the 7th respondent has no

title or right whatsoever. Then, the petitioner is asking to issue a writ

of mandamus to the 1st to 4th respondents to issue a permit to the state

land in his name. The petitioner has done a purposeless transaction

with the 7th respondent, and precisely, his interests have not been

affected by any administrative action.

Page 9 of 10

The case of Samarakoon and Others V. University Grants

Commission and Others (2005) 1 Sri L.R. 119 explains how

"legitimate expectation" derives. It was held that "Legitimate expectation

derives from an undertaking given by someone in authority, and such

an undertaking may not even be expressed and would have to be known

from the surrounding circumstances." In the case at hand, the

petitioner could not have legitimate expectations because the petitioner

had no transaction or connection in respect of this land with the 1st

respondent, divisional secretary, or any other official engaged in issuing

permits, and he had transactions only with the 7th respondent, who had

no right to the state land.

In, Union of India v Hindustan Development Corporation- (1993)

SCC (3) 499 it was stated that, the legitimacy of an expectation can be

inferred, if it is founded on the sanction of law or custom or an

established procedure followed in a natural and regular sequence. In

the case at hand, no sanction of law, custom or an established

procedure was followed by the petitioner. They have engaged in

personal transactions on a property owned by the state.

According to the petition, without a permit under Land Development

Ordinance or without any legal right, 5th and 6th respondents have

possessed the land and illegally transferred the state land for a sum of

Rs.1,500,000/- to the 7th respondent. Again, the 7th respondent made

an illegal transaction with the petitioner and executed the transfer

agreement, P-6 to transfer the state land to the petitioner. It is to be

noted that violators of law are not entitled to legitimate expectation as

observed in the case of Cinnamond v. British Airports Authority

[1980] 1 W.L.R. 582. This decision has also been followed by the Indian

Supreme Court in Madras City Wine Merchants' Association. and

Another v. State of Tamil Nadu and Another Case No: Appeal (civil)

4981 of 1994, decided on 27 July, 1994.

Page 10 of 10

In this application, the petitioner sought to quash the permit given to

the 5th respondent and to issue the permit for the land to the petitioner.

As stated above, the petitioner has no legal right or interest whatsoever

in the land in question, and thus he has no locus standi in asking to

issue a permit in his name. In addition, as the petitioner has no locus

standi to maintain this case for the reasons stated above, the petitioner

cannot challenge the permit granted to the 5th respondent by the 1st

respondent.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the petitioner has no locus standi

to maintain this application. The preliminary objection is upheld. The

application for Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus is dismissed without

costs.
