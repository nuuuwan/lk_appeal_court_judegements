Hon. Justice Menaka Wijesundera

Accused Appellant is produced in Court via zoom platform by the Prison Authorities.

The instant appeal has been filed to set aside a judgment dated 06.08.2021, by the

High Court of Colombo.

In the instant matter the Accused-Appellant has been indicted for possession and

trafficking of 1.33 grams of heroin in two separate charges. At the end of the trial the

learned Trial Judge had found him guilty of both offences and had proceeded to

sentence him, and for the 1st charge a fine of Rs. 250,000/- in default two years

imprisonment and ten years rigorous imprisonment, for the 2nd charge the same as

above and the two sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively.

When the matter was taken up for argument the Counsel appearing for the Accused-

Appellant stated that he is not contesting the conviction but only the sentence. The

learned Counsel for the Respondent did not object for the application as such Court

heard both counsel in mitigation.

3

Upon considering the submissions of both parties, we are of the opinion that the

sentence of rigorous imprisonment of ten years to be reduced to seven years rigorous

imprisonment and the sentence for 1st charge to remain the same and both to run

concurrently from the date of sentencing which is 06.08.2021.

The rest of the sentences to remain the same with regard to the 1st and the 2nd

charges. Subject to the above the instant application is dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

Hon. Justice B. Sasi Mahendran

I agree.
