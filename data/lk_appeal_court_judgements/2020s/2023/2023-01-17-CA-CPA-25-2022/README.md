MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to set aside the order dated 22.8.2020

of the High Court of Colombo in which bail has been refused to the accused

namely Sabdeen Mohamed Suber.

The accused in the instant matter had been remanded for the possession

28.158 kilograms of pure quantity of heroin under the provisions of Poisons

Opium and Dangerous Drugs act and has been in remand ever since

The main submission of the Counsel for the accused is that firstly he had been

detained under the Prevention of Terrorism act and thereafter while in

detention based on his statement a parcel of heroin had been found from a

house which the Counsel for the accused allege the police is not divulging the

name of the real owner. He further said that the suspect was arrested at the

Katunayake International airport.

The Counsel for the respondents vehemently objected to the application and

stated that the suspect was trying to leave the country violating the bail

conditions of a case in which he is the third accused in a case of armed robbery.

In the instant matter too along with the parcel of heroin weapons and

ammunition had been found.

The Presidents Counsel for the suspect further alleged that there was no

exclusive possession of the heroin recovered because the suspect had no keys

to the house in which the alleged heroin had been found.

The learned High Court Judge has considered the same and had rejected both

grounds as being not suitable to enlarge the accused on bail.

The law pertaining to the instant matter is that if a suspect is produced under

section 54 A and B the said suspect can be released on bail only upon

exceptional conditions by the Court of Appeal if the amount is over 10 grams

notwithstanding section 84 and 85 of the latest amendment (act no 41 of

2022) to the Poisons and Opium and Dangerous Drugs act.

The term exceptional has not been defined in the act but numerous cases so

far decided had held that the exceptionality is determined by the facts of

each case.

In the instant case the exceptionality averred is the fact that although the

parcel of heroin was found on the statement of the suspect the recovery has

not been made in the presence of the suspect and the heroin and the

weapons and the ammunition had been recovered from a house to which

the connection to the suspect had not been revealed.

But the Counsel for the respondents stated that the house from which the

recoveries were made had to be forced open and that it belonged to the aunt

of the suspect.

But the evidential value of the recoveries made on the statement of the

suspect is to be considered at trial stage but the question to be considered

now is whether the remanding of the suspect is fair in view of the facts

revealed at the investigations. But in the recently decided judgment of the

Supreme Court SC Appeal 53 of 2022 has held that morality should not be

considered in an application for bail. The said Judgement reads as follows,

.morality as a yardstick in an application for or revision in

relation to an offence committed under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs ordinance, I am of the view that the Court of Appeal has erred in

considering morality as a yardstick or an exceptional ground in an

application for revision in relation to an offence committed under the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

As such we see no exceptional ground urged by the Counsel for the suspect

hence the instant application for revision is hereby dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

I agree.
