The Petitioner is seeking for a writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st

Respondent, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (Corporation) to interdict the Petitioner as

reflected in P6 and also quashing the Charge Sheet, marked P12, issued against the

Petitioner.

The Petitioners main contention is that the Corporation has interdicted the Petitioner

violating the basic rules stipulated in Clause 9 of the Disciplinary Rules (Rules) of the

Corporation (P9). The Petitioner contends that the Corporation without being satisfied

that there is prima facie evidence against the Petitioner, has taken steps to interdict him.

Non-completion of the investigation by the Criminal Investigation Department against the

Petitioner is the basis for the paramount argument of the Petitioner and accordingly, he

asserts that the Charge Sheet, marked P12, has been issued without considering proper

evidence.

The Respondents argument is based on Clause 20 of the Rules which provides that if an

employee is taken into custody by Sri Lanka Police (Police) etc., he shall be regarded as

interdicted from service. The Clause 20;

20.a. If an employee is taken into custody by Police or other authorities he shall

be regarded as interdicted from service from the date of his detention.

However, this shall not act as a bar for the conduct of a Formal

Summary/Disciplinary Inquiry under these rules except where the

continued detention of the accused employee makes it impossible for the

conduct of the Inquiry.

20.b. The Disciplinary Inquiry under these rules may be proceeded with

irrespective of whether the accused employee is charged before a Court or

not or by reason of his acquittal or discharge or by reason of the fact that no

punishment has been imposed on him in any criminal proceedings instituted

against him.

The B-Reports tendered to Court along with the Petition of the Petitioner evince that the

Petitioner has been taken into custody by Police. On a careful perusal of the letter of

interdiction, marked P6, it implies that the Petitioner has been solely interdicted based

on such arrest and however, subject to a disciplinary inquiry being held.

I take the view that the said Clause 20 of the Rules empowers the Corporation to interdict

any employee upon an arrest of such employee even before conducting an inquiry as those

provisions do not prescribe any pre-condition to be fulfilled before such interdiction. That

is merely because when an employee is taken into custody by Police, by operation of such

Rules, he shall be regarded interdicted from service from the date of his detention. Thus,

in my view, the Corporation in such instances is not bound to be satisfied that there is a

prima facie case against the employee before interdicting him.

For the purpose of challenging the said impugned Charge Sheet, the Petitioner takes the

same stand that the said Charge Sheet has been issued before concluding the relevant

investigations. This Court has constantly decided that when the facts are in dispute and in

order to get at the truth, it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in a suit or

at an inquiry where the parties would have ample opportunity to examine their witnesses.

The Court would interfere in respect of such an inquiry only if the statutory procedure laid

down is insufficient to achieve justice or in an event such procedure has been blatantly

violated.

The Petitioner still has ample opportunity to challenge any decision of the Respondents

after the investigations (including the domestic inquiry) are over. The interdiction will not

be a presumption of guilt and it cannot be considered as a punishment. The interdiction is

one of the foremost processes used upon an appropriate criteria to initiate investigations

in to allege misconducts. (See-W. G. Chamila vs. Urban Development Authority and others,

CA/WRIT/215/2022 decided on 26.10.2022)

In passing, I wish to highlight here the following passages by H. W. R. Wade and C. F.

Forsyth under the topic of no evidence rule in Administrative Law (11th Edition) Oxford

(at p. 227);

Findings of fact are traditionally the domain where a deciding authority or tribunal is

master in its own house. Provided only that it stays within its jurisdiction, its findings are in

general exempt from review by the courts, which will in any case respect the decision of the

body that saw and heard the witnesses or took evidence directly. Just as the courts look

jealously on decisions by other bodies on matters of law, so they look indulgently on their

decisions on matters of fact.

The Petitioner has failed to establish prima facie that the Respondents have taken a

decision which is eminently irrational or unreasonable or is guilty of an illegality

warranting this Court to issue formal notice of this Application on the Respondents.

Thus, this Court refuses issuing formal notice on the Respondents.

Application is dismissed.
