RESPONDENTS

BEFORE : M. SAMPATH K. B. WIJERATNE, J

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J

COUNSEL : Bhagya Gunawardhana instructed by Senior Counsel

R. Chula Bandara for the Petitioner.

Sumathi Dharmawardena ASG, PC and Shemanthi

Dunuwila SC for the 16th Respondent.

ARGUED ON : 16.05.2023

DECIDED ON : 20.06.2023

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The petitioner filed the instant application seeking mandates in the

nature of writs of certiorari to quash the orders marked P-14, P-10, and

P-8.

There was a disciplinary inquiry against the petitioner for his conduct

while engaging in duties as an Authorized Officer at the arrival terminal

of the Bandaranaike International Airport. P-8 is the order of the

disciplinary inquiry dated 30.12.2015 issued by the Controller General

of the Department of Immigration and Emigration informing the

petitioner that he was acquitted of charges I, II, and III and convicted of

Page 7 of 14

charges IV, V, and VI. It was directed by the disciplinary order;

I. To defer one salary increment that fell after 24.04.2014.

II. To charge Rs.30,000/- from the petitioner to be paid in 24

installments.

Being aggrieved by the said disciplinary order, the petitioner preferred

an appeal to the Public Service Commission (PSC). P-10 is the decision

of the Public Service Commission conveyed to the Controller General

with a copy to the petitioner. By the said decision, it was directed to

incorporate into the order of the disciplinary authority regarding the

payment of back wages withheld during the period of interdiction in

accordance with the provisions of the Establishment Code. In addition,

it was directed to revoke the order of the disciplinary authority to pay

Rs. 30,000/- by the petitioner. Accordingly, the only disciplinary order

remaining against the petitioner was to defer one salary increment that

fell after 24.04.2014.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Public Service Commission, the

petitioner appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). After

an inquiry, the AAT dismissed the petitioners appeal. P-14 is the order

of the AAT.

At the commencement of the hearing, the learned Additional Solicitor

General appeared for the 16th respondent had raised an objection

regarding the maintainability of this application, and had submitted

that the decision of the Public Service Commission cannot be

challenged or reviewed by the Court of Appeal in terms of Article 61A of

the Constitution. As such, the learned Additional Solicitor General

contended that the relief sought by the petitioner is futile and cannot

be granted by this court.

Page 8 of 14

The learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that this application

could be maintained because the main relief sought by the petitioner is

to quash the order made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

The learned Counsel for both parties have requested to dispose the

matter by way of written submissions. Application has been allowed

and accordingly, written submissions have been tendered on behalf of

both parties.

In the written submissions tendered on behalf of the 16th respondent,

the facts relating to the application have not been dealt with and only

the matters pertaining to the aforesaid objection have been stated. It is

stated in the written submission that the decision of the AAT may be

challenged at the Court of Appeal but the decision of the PSC cannot be

challenged or reviewed by the Court of Appeal in view of Article 61A of

the Constitution. In addition, while submitting the relevant judicial

authorities, it is stated in the said written submission that the

petitioner has not come before this court with clean hands and has

violated the principle of uberrima fides. The violation has not been

clearly specified but it is stated in 16th respondents written submission

that the petitioner has been promoted to Grade 1 of the authorized

officer with effect from 21.12.2019. Hence, the petitioner's

unreasonable, baseless request has been made on the basis of this

untruth.

The petitioner has stated in his petition that he is an Authorized Officer.

I am of the view that non-disclosure of the fact that he has been

promoted to Grade 1 of the Authorized Officer does not tantamount to

deceiving or misleading of this Court. Therefore, this application need

not be dismissed in limine for violation of the principle of uberrima fides.

In reply to the aforesaid first argument, the learned counsel for the

petitioner submitted relevant judicial authorities and contended that it

Page 9 of 14

is settled law that a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on

a Public Service Commission decision can be impugned under Article

140 of the Constitution.

It was admitted by the 16th respondent that a decision of the AAT may

be challenged at the Court of Appeal. The main argument on behalf of

the 16th respondent was that a decision of the Public Service

Commission cannot be challenged or reviewed by the Court of Appeal

in terms of Article 61A of the Constitution. At the same time, citing a

judicial authority, it was stated in the written submissions tendered on

behalf of the 16th respondent that it is an established rule of

interpretation that a court cannot do indirectly what is prohibited from

doing directly. It has been held in the case of Bandaranaike v.

Weeraratne and Others- (1981) 1 SLR 10 at 16 that There is a

general rule in the construction of Statutes that what a Court or person

is prohibited from doing directly, it may not do indirectly or in a

circuitous manner.

Article 61A of the Constitution reads as follows;

[Subject to the provisions of Article 59 and of Article 126], no court or

tribunal shall have power or jurisdiction to inquire into, or pronounce

upon or in any manner call in question any order or decision made by

the Commission, a Committee, or any public officer, in pursuance of

any power or duty conferred or imposed on such Commission, or

delegated to a Committee or public officer, under this Chapter or under

any other law.

(What is mentioned in Article 61A as Commission is the Public

Service Commission)

Therefore, it is apparent that an order of the Public Service Commission

cannot be challenged or reviewed by this Court. Hence, the order of the

Public Service Commission marked P-10 cannot be challenged by way

of a writ of certiorari. The only thing done by the PSC by its order P-10,

Page 10 of 14

was to affirm (subject to certain amendments) the order P-8 issued by

the 16th respondent. If the PSC order cannot be challenged in terms of

the Articles of the Constitution, the order P-8 also could not be allowed

to challenge because the Court should not do indirectly what it is

prohibited from doing directly.

Now, only the relief prayed for by the petitioner that the decision of the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal be quashed by way of writ of certiorari

remains to be considered. In the Supreme Court case of Ratnayake v.

Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Others -(2013) 1 Sri. L.R 331,

it was held as follows; The Court of Appeal did possess jurisdiction to

hear and determine the application filed before it. AAT is not a body

exercising any power delegated to it by PSC, and is an appellate tribunal

constituted in terms of Article 59(1) of the Constitution having the

power, where appropriate, to alter, vary or rescind any order or decision

of the PSC. Therefore, this court has jurisdiction under Article 140 of

the Constitution to review an order made by the AAT.

As previously stated, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, in its order

marked P-14, affirmed the petitioner's convictions on charges IV, V, and

VI of the charge sheet, as well as the disciplinary order deferring one

salary increment that fell after 29.04.2014. In perusing the order P-14,

it appears that evidence presented at the disciplinary inquiry has been

narrated and the contents of the appellants written statement have also

been narrated in the said order. Then, it is stated in the order, without

reasons, that based on the aforesaid evidence of the prosecution

witnesses, the appellant had been rightly found guilty of charges IV, V,

and VI. Accordingly, the appeal of the appellant has been dismissed by

the AAT.

If it is a judgment of a lower court, without reasons for the findings of

the learned judge, the said judgment is liable to be set aside. However,

the situation here is different. The AAT is an appellate body and it only

Page 11 of 14

considers whether sufficient evidence had been presented at the inquiry

for the PSC to arrive at its conclusion. Therefore, only for the reason of

not stating reasons by the AAT for its order, a writ of certiorari need not

be issued to quash the said order. This Court must see whether there

are any grounds to issue a writ of certiorari in order to quash the order

of the AAT.

The charges for which the petitioner was convicted were as follows;

IV. On 24.04.2014, whilst engaging in duties assigned during the

night shift at the arrival terminal of the Bandaranaike

International Airport, committed an offence under Section 13

of Schedule 1 of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishment Code by

acting in a manner which interrupted the official duties of

Senior Authorized Officers Mr. P. D. U. R. de Alwis and Mr. P.

Keerthisena by having a verbal altercation and behaving in

an indecent manner towards Senior Authorized Officer Mr. P.

D. U. R. de Alwis.

V. At the same time and place, disregarding the order of Senior

Authorized Officer Mr. P.D.U.R. de Alwis, stepping down and

going away from the service counter while large numbers of

passengers were waiting in the counter to obtain clearance

and thereby committed an offence under Section 14 of

Schedule 1 of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishment Code.

VI. Committed the offence of bring the Public Service into

disrepute by committing one or more of the offences

contained in charges I to V.

In paragraph 10 of the petition, the petitioner has admitted that on the

day in question around 00.30 hours, he has stepped down from his

counter to have a snack and a cup of tea before taking his scheduled

interval. So, it is clear that the petitioner had stepped down from his

Page 12 of 14

counter without obtaining permission from any higher officer

disregarding the order of Senior Authorized Officer Mr. G.D.U.R de

Alwis. It has been revealed from the evidence of the disciplinary inquiry

that it was a very busy day with a lot of passengers in the airport. In

addition, the petitioner admits in paragraph 11 of his petition that after

becoming aware that Senior Authorized Officer G.D.U.R de Alwis had

abused him, the petitioner asked Mr. Alwis why he was abusing him.

The aforementioned incident of Mr. Alwis being asked why he was

abusing the petitioner appears to be the beginning of the dispute.

According to the way that the incident has been described in the

petition by the petitioner, Mr. Alwis had done various things during this

dispute but the petitioner had done nothing. Although, the petitioners

position was that, it is abundantly clear from the evidence of the

disciplinary inquiry that there was a heated argument between the

petitioner and Mr. Alwis. Also, there is evidence that there was a big

clamor and there was an imminent danger of physical assault. The

petitioner admitted in paragraph 12 of his petition that the Assistant

Controller, C.H. Gamage ordered the petitioner to leave the room

immediately.

The situation at the time of the incident has been explained in the

disciplinary inquiry by the Assistant Controller, C.H. Gamage in the

following way.

As there is a large crowd at the arrival terminal during these

clearance operations, the officials were asked to come to the counters

quickly to carry out the clearing operations. Although the officials came

to the counters, Mr. Udaya Kumara came to the counter too late. Mr. Alwis

said that he came and cleared the people in his counter but did not assist

the people in other counters. While doing so, Mr. Udaya Kumara stepped

away from the counter where he was working, Mr. Alwis said.

Page 13 of 14

In this way, the argument between Mr. Upul Alwis and Mr. Udaya

Kumara continued clamorously.

Even after coming to the room, the heated argument between

Mr. Upul Alwis and Mr. Udaya Kumara took place for about five minutes

in an impassioned tone. At that time, I observed how both of them tried

to hit each other. At this time, the few foreigners in the room and the few

local passengers went out immediately as if in panic. At this time, the

other authorized officers who were there, senior authorized officer,

Mr. Keerthisena, and I tried to calm the situation by placing the two on

opposite sides. Here, I stopped this quarrel about three times and

strongly told Mr. Udaya Kumara to leave immediately. Mr. Upul Alwis

was also told strongly.

Mr. Alwis may have displayed aggressive behavior at that time.

However, if the petitioner had not been quarrelsome and only Mr. Alwis

had been disruptive, there would have been no need for the other

officers to ask the petitioner to leave that place. It should be noted that

this dispute arose as a result of the petitioner stepping down from his

counter to have a snack and a cup of tea without permission. As a

senior officer, Mr. Alwis had the right to question the petitioner about

why he had left his counter before his scheduled break. However, before

Mr. Alwis, the petitioner asked Mr. Alwis why he was abusing the

petitioner, which resulted in the discord between the petitioner and the

Senior Authorized Officer, Mr. Alwis. Such behavior in a place like an

airport create a bad image regarding the standard of discipline of the

officers in our country even to foreigners.

In considering the entirety of the evidence and the statement of the

petitioner presented in the disciplinary inquiry, the order of convicting

the petitioner for charges IV, V, and VI is reasonable, lawful and the

order is substantiated by the evidence adduced in the disciplinary

inquiry. The disciplinary order that should be imposed on the petitioner

is to defer one salary increment and that is a just and equitable order

Page 14 of 14

considering the nature of the charges on which the petitioner was

convicted. Therefore, I hold that the conclusion of the AAT to dismiss

the appeal preferred against the order of the PSC is correct.

Accordingly, the application is dismissed with costs fixed at

Rs. 30,000/-.
