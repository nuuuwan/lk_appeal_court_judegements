S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner in this Writ Application is functioning as a Deputy Commissioner in the

Sri Lanka Inland Revenue Service and is an officer belonging to the Sri Lanka Inland

Revenue Service. A charge sheet was served on him on 25.02.2016 (marked as A1) by

the Public Service Commission (the PSC) containing eight charges alleging that he had

committed several offences by neglecting official duties and/or misconducts that fall

under the 1st Schedule of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments Code. Thereafter the

charge sheet was amended twice on 29.07.2016 and 20.09.2016 (A2 and A3) by adding

two new charges. After a formal disciplinary inquiry was held the PSC decided that the

Petitioner was guilty of the charges I - VIII and X and not guilty of the charge IX in the

charge sheets and decided to defer one salary increment and reprimand him severely

(A4). The Petitioner appealed to the Administrative Appeal Tribunal (the AAT) against

that decision of the PSC. The AAT dismissed the appeal on 28.10.2019 (A6). By this

Writ Application, the Petitioner challenges the decision of the AAT.

The substantive reliefs sought by the Petitioner in this Writ Application are as follows;

b) Issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the Order of the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal marked as X6;

c) Issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the Decision and/or Order of the Public

Service Commission contained in the letter dated 31st May 2018 marked A4

annexed to the Appeal marked X1;

d) Issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the Charge Sheet dated 25th February 2016

as amended by amended Charge Sheets dated 29th July 2016 and 20th September

2016 marked A1, A2 and A3 respectively annexed to the Appeal marked X1;

7

The charges that the Petitioner was found guilty of at the formal disciplinary inquiry

and subsequently affirmed by the PSC as stated in the charge sheets are as follows;

Charge I

That the Appellant had committed an offence in terms of Clause 13 of the first Schedule

of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments Code by sending a letter through electronic

media drawing the attention of A.A.T.P. Amarasinghe, I.P. Apsara, B.D.P.B.

Bulanawewa, N.M. Corea, and some others about an interview by the Lankadeepa

newspaper with the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, Mallika Samarasekara,

on 15.07.2014 about Why taxation is required? on or around 8.40 a.m. under the

caption The best joke of the day!.

Charge II

That the Appellant 28.05.2017 around 8.45 a.m. had sent a letter by electronic media to

persons mentioned above, containing disgraceful statements aimed at one or more

officers, under the title The truthful note for review of intelligence! thereby violating

Clause 13 of the 1st Schedule of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments Code.

Charge III

That the Appellant on 03.06.2014, around 10.56 a.m. had sent a letter by electronic

media to persons mentioned in charge I above, containing disgraceful statements under

the title Tax alert/golden key aimed at one or more officers, thereby violating Clause

13 of the 1st Schedule of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments Code.

Charge IV

That the Appellant had released or allowed other parties to review a document

containing information on matters relating to making aware the top management about

a document relating to Matters I have come to know about a deceitful transaction/file

8

No 114146889/ WHEELS LANKA (Pvt.) Ltd, thereby committing an offence falling

under Clause 11 of the 1st Schedule of the Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments Code.

Charge V

That the Appellant had given copies of the letter titled Committing a deceitful

transaction of 50 million /TIN/114146889/WHEELS LANKA/GA branch (LTU)

DATED 07.02.2013 which had been addressed to the Commissioner General of the

Inland Revenue, to another party/ parties or allowing to receive copies thereby

committing an offence falling under Clause 11 of the 1st Schedule of Chapter XLVIII

of the Establishments Code.

Charge VI

That the Appellant had given copies of the letter titled Matters I have come to know

about a deceitful transaction - file no 114146889 the name of the company when

WHEELSLANKA Pvt Ltd, of 05.06.2014, containing charges made against one or

more officers in the Department by him, thereby committing an offence under Clause

13 of the 1st Schedule of the Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments Code.

Charge VII

That the Appellant had sent copies of a letter dated 07.02.2013 addressed to the CGIR

Committing a deceitful transaction of Rs.50m tin 114146889- WHEELSLANKA

Pvt Ltd 6A branch (LTU) dated 07.02.2013.

Charge VIII

That the Appellant had evaded making a statement to A.M. Jabeer, Director of the

Department of Development of Finance of the General Treasury who had been

appointed by the CGIR by his letter No. (// /) of 19062016 as the

Preliminary Investigation Officer, thereby committing an offence under Clause 15 of

the 1st Schedule of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments Code.

9

Charge X

That he had committed an offence under Clause 10 of the 1st Schedule of the

Establishments Code by committing one or more or all the above offences.

The charges for which the Petitioner was found guilty can be grouped mainly into two

segments. Charges No. 1 - 3, 6 and 7 were identical and the allegation was that the

Petitioner by circulating certain e-mails had violated Clause 13 of the 1st Schedule of

Offences Committed by Public Officers. At the Argument, the learned Counsel

appearing for the Petitioner admitted that the said e-mails originated from the

Petitioners e-mail account and were sent by the Petitioner even though at the formal

disciplinary inquiry the Petitioner had taken up the position that the prosecution has not

proved that those e-mails were sent by the Petitioner. However, since the emails had

originated from the Petitioners official e-mail account, in terms of Section 114 of the

Evidence Ordinance the Court can presume that those e-mails were sent by the

Petitioner. The oral submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner based on that

the AAT has failed to take into consideration that the charges against the Petitioner

were not proved and therefore, not proved that the Petitioner had violated any provision

in the Establishments Code.

The relevant e-mails are tendered by the Respondents marked as R1a - R1e. One of the

allegations against the Petitioner is based on the fact that by circulating those e-mails

the Petitioner had committed an offence listed under Item 13 of the 1st Schedule in the

Establishments Code. Item 13 provides that, conduct oneself or act in such manner as

to obstruct a public officer in the discharge of his duties, or insult, or cause or threaten

to cause bodily harm to a public officer.

10

The learned Counsel drew the attention of the Court to the fact that at the formal

disciplinary inquiry, no officer had given evidence to the effect that those e-mails had

obstructed his/her official duties or caused any insult or threat of bodily harm.

Therefore, the learned Counsel argued that the prosecution had failed to prove that the

Petitioner had committed an offence listed under Item 13 of the 1st Schedule in the

Establishments Code.

The second segment of charges in the 4th, 5th, 8th and 10th charges are based on the two

letters sent by the Petitioner to the Commissioner General of the Inland Revenue

Department and the allegation is that the Petitioner had made available those letters to

the outside parties and committed an offence listed under item II of the 1st Schedule of

the Establishments Code. Item 11 is as follows;

Divulge information that may harm the State, the State Service or other State

Institution or make available or cause to make available State documents or copies

thereof to outside parties without the permission of an appropriate authority.

The argument of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner is that those letters

were circulated among the officers within the Department and not to the outside parties

and those letters are not State documents. The contention of the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner is that the AAT has failed to consider the fact that at the formal disciplinary

inquiry, those facts were not considered.

In respect of charge No. 08 that the Petitioner had evaded making a statement to the

Officer appointed from the General Treasury to conduct the preliminary investigation

and by that, he had committed an offence under Item 15 of the 1st Schedule of the

Establishments Code, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted to Court that the

11

Petitioner did not refuse to make a statement but he insisted to appoint an Officer to

conduct the inquiry within the Inland Revenue Department and objected for appointing

an Officer from the Treasury.

The Section 13.10 of Chapter XLVIII in the Establishments Code states thus;

It would be an act of grave misconduct for an officer to refuse to make a statement

about an investigation when he is required to do so by an officer duly appointed to

conduct a preliminary investigation.

The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner contended that the provisions in

Section 13.10 which refers to grave misconduct do not apply to a suspected or suspect

officer and since the Petitioner was a suspected officer either he could explain or remain

silent. The position of the learned Counsel is that the AAT has failed to consider that

fact also. Accordingly, the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argued that for

the reasons above-mentioned, the Order of the AAT dated 28.10.2019 is illegal. On that

basis, the Petitioner prays for the reliefs sought in the Petition.

In the e-mail marked R1(c)/R3 XIV, the Petitioner has stated that

. This Court is of the view that the said statement of the Petitioner

itself amounts to an obstruction in the functioning of official duties of the entire officers

in the Inland Revenue Department and necessity does not arise to adduce any further

oral evidence to establish that the Petitioner had obstructed the official duties of the

officers to find him guilty to the offence listed under Item 13 of the 1st Schedule of the

Establishments Code.

In respect of the 2nd charge under Item 11 of the 1st Schedule of the Establishments

Code about divulging information to the outside parties, the learned State Counsel

12

appearing for the Respondents submitted that the structure of the Inland Revenue

Department consists of many Units and the work dealing with financial records and tax

records of tax payees by every Unit should keep in secret and should not divulge even

to the officers who work in another Unit. The learned SC submitted to the Court that

the charge under Item 11 of the Establishments Code is based on the letter sent by the

Petitioner marked as R3-VIII to the Commissioner General with copies to the Trade

Unions in the Inland Revenue Department. In that letter, the Petitioner has mentioned

a certain taxpayer and his Tax Identification Number (TIN number). The learned SC

argued that the names of the taxpayers and their TIN numbers are confidential

information and should not be divulged to anybody. Nevertheless, the Petitioner has

copied R3-VIII to all the Trade Unions in the Inland Revenue Department which

constituted an offence under Item 11 of the Establishments Code and the learned SC

argued that the decision that the Petitioner has committed an offence under Item 11 of

the 1st Schedule in the Establishments Code is according to the evidence of the case.

Section 209 of the Inland Revenue Act, No.10 of 2006 provides that the officers in the

Inland Revenue Department shall preserve secrecy about all matters relating to the

affairs of any person that may come to his knowledge in the performance of his duties

under the Inland Revenue Act and shall not communicate any such matter to any person

other than the person such matter relates. Furthermore, in terms of the Code of Ethics

issued to the officers in the Inland Revenue Department marked as R2-a, they should

protect the secrecy of the information and data of the Department. As stated by Sanjiv

Khanna, J. in Central Public Information Officer, Supreme Court of India vs Subhash

Chandra Agarwal1,

1 Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 in page 39.

13

The fiduciary is expected to act in confidence and for the benefit and

advantage of the beneficiary, and use good faith and fairness in dealing with

the beneficiary or the things belonging to the beneficiary. If the beneficiary has

entrusted anything to the fiduciary, to hold the thing in trust or to execute

certain acts in regard to or with reference to the entrusted thing, the fiduciary

has to act in confidence and is expected not to disclose the thing or information

to any third party.

The term fiduciary was defined in the case of Central Board of Secondary Education

v. Aditya Bandopadhyay2 as follows,

a person having a duty to act for the benefit of another, showing good faith

and candour, where such other person reposes trust and special confidence in

the person owing or discharging the duty. The term fiduciary relationship is

used to describe a situation or transaction where one person (beneficiary)

places complete confidence in another person (fiduciary) in regard to his

affairs, business or transaction(s). The term also refers to a person who holds

a thing in trust for another (beneficiary).

Considering all the above-stated facts, the Court can conclude that the acts committed

by the Petitioner are against the provisions of the Establishments Code, the Inland

Revenue Act, and the Code of Ethics applicable to the officers in the Inland Revenue

Department.

A preliminary inquiry is a fact-finding investigation to ascertain whether there is any

material to frame charges against an officer to conduct a formal disciplinary inquiry.

Up until a charge sheet is served the officer concerned is not a suspect. Therefore, the

Petitioner should have given a statement to the officer who had conducted the

2 (2011) 8 SCC 497 para 21.

14

preliminary inquiry and failure to do so constitutes an offence under Section 13.10 read

with Item 15 of the 1st Schedule of the Establishments Code. When considering all the

above-stated facts and circumstances the Court can conclude that the decision of the

AAT is according to law and has no basis to interfere with the findings of the AAT.

The learned SC appearing for the Respondents submitted to the Court that since the

reliefs sought in prayers (c) and (d) in the Petition deals with the decision of the PSC

and the charge sheet issued on behalf of the PSC, in terms of Article 61A of the

Constitution this Court has no jurisdiction to grant reliefs sought in those prayers.

It is trite law that the writ jurisdiction could not be invoked in respect of the decisions

of the PSC.

Article 61A of the Constitution provides that;

"[Subject to the provisions of Article 59 and of Article 126], no court or tribunal

shall have power or jurisdiction to inquire into, or pronounce upon or in any

manner call in question any order or decision made by the Commission, a

Committee, or any public officer, in pursuance of any power or duty conferred

or imposed on such Commission, or delegated to a Committee or public officer,

under this Chapter or under any other law."

In the case of Dr. M.D. W. Lokuge vs. Vidyajothi Dr. Dayasiri Fernando, Chairman, of

the Public Service Commission and 11 Others3, Justice A.H.M.D. NAWAZ, J, held,

"The exercise of writ jurisdiction in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution is

subject to the provisions of the Constitution in that Article 61A of the

Constitution would preclude judicial review of decisions of the PSC. When the

3 C.A. (Writ) Application No. 468/2021 at page 8.

15

jurisdiction of this Court to judicially review PSC decisions by certiorari is shut

out at a threshold stage, a revisit of that decision in the guise of mandamus or

certiorari will be beyond the pale of our jurisdiction and on that score, we are

inclined to hold with the submissions of the learned Deputy Solicitor General

that mandamus will not lie in the instant case before us."

In the case of Locomotive Operators Engineers Union and 2 Others Vs. Justice N.E.

Dissanayake (Chairman of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal) and 29 Others4,

Sobhitha Rajakaruna, J. held that,

"Firstly, I observe that it is now settled law that a decision of the AAT on a PSC

decision can be impugned under Article 140 of the Constitution. The AAT is not

a body exercising any power delegated to it by the PSC but is an appellate

tribunal constituted in terms of Article 59(1) of the Constitution (See

Rathanayake y Administrative Appeals Tribunal & others, (2013) 1 Sri LR 331;

Lakmini Delapola v Justice SI Imam & others, CA Writ Application, 263/2013,

CA minutes 26.07.2019; and K.N. Mankotte v Justice S.I. Imam & others, CA

Writ 249/2015, CA Minutes 06.03.2019). However, the jurisdiction of the Court

of Appeal under Article 140 would be limited to a review of the decision of the

AAT, and would not extend to quashing decisions of the PSC or of a committee

or public official to whom the powers of the PSC have been delegated. (See

W.A.G. Weerasinghe v P.M.K. Malalasekara & others, CA Writ Application No.

256/2018, CA Minutes 19.03.2021)"

4 C.A. (Writ) Application No. 160/2013 at page 19.

16

In the case of Mohamed Ismail Wahabdeen Vs. His Lordship Jayantha Jayasuriya,

Chairman, Judicial Service Commission5, Sobhitha Rajakaruna, J. held as follows;

"On a careful perusal of the provisions of the said Article 61A, it is apparent

that a wider spectrum of indemnity has been conferred to the PSC precluding

even the issuance of prerogative writs against the PSC by the Court of Appeal

in as much as the said Article specifically spell out the words "no court or

tribunal". Therefore, it appears that the legislature has made a clear distinction

between Article 111K and 61A. However, in terms of the said Article 61A, the

jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 126 (along with the jurisdiction

of AAT) has not been precluded."

Therefore, in terms of the Constitutional provisions and the court decisions, the

Petitioner has no right to invoke the Writ jurisdiction of this Court against the acts

and/or decisions of the PSC. Therefore, the Petitioner is not entitled to the reliefs sought

in the prayers (c) and (d) to the Petition.

In prayer (b) the Petitioner seek a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the AAT.

Even if the decision of the AAT is quashed the decision of the PSC stands. The

Petitioner has not sought to refer the matter back to the AAT to revisit its Order.

Therefore, even if the Court quashes the decision of the AAT it cannot refer the matter

back to the AAT for reconsideration. In that context this Writ Application is futile.

Under the above-stated circumstances, we hold that this Writ Application is without

5 C.A. (Writ) Application No. 339/2019 at page 12.

17

merits and should be dismissed. Accordingly, the Writ Application is dismissed. No

costs ordered.

M.T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. I agree.
