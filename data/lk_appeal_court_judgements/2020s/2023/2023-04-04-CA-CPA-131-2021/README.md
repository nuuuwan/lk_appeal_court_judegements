Iddawala J

This is a revision application against the order of the Gampaha High Court

dated 10/12/2021 which affirmed the order of the Attanagalla Magistrate

Court dated 03/02/2020 where the accused-appellant-petitioner (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the petitioner) was convicted for three offences under

the Penal Code and the Motor Traffic Act.

On or around 20/09/2010 the petitioner, was driving the car WP KD-9026

(hereinafter the said vehicle) when an accident took place killing 1 passenger

in the said vehicle, (designated driver of the vehicle) who was sitting in the

rear seat. The evidence claims to state that, at the time of the accident there

were 3 individuals travelling in the vehicle and that the accident took place

few minutes after they resumed their journey after stopping for dinner. Upon

the consideration and evaluation of evidence given at trial by the witnesses

including the evidence of the petitioner, the learned Magistrate convicted the

accused- petitioner for the offence committed. The accused petitioner was

convicted for 3 charges under the Penal Code and the Motor Traffic Act.

- Charge 1: the accused-appellant petitioner was sentenced to a 1-year

rigorous imprisonment which was suspended for 5 years for the

conviction of negligently causing a deadly road accident under Section

298 of the Penal Code.

- Charge 2 & 3: the accused-appellant petitioner was fined Rs. 2500/- x

2 (Rs.5000/-) for being convicted for 2 road offences under the Motor

Traffic Act.

Further the accused-appellant was ordered to pay Rs. 100,000/- as

compensation to the victims family.

Aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate of Attanagalla, the

accused-appellant petitioner appealed to the High Court of Gampaha which

affirmed the same and dismissed the application. Thereby the accused-

appellant petitioner through a revision application to the Court of Appeal

seeks this Court to set aside the order of Attanagalla Magistrate Court dated

03/02/2020 and the order of the Gampaha High Court dated 10/12/2021.

The ultimate objective, when a revision application is filed through Article 138

of the Constitution, is to assess whether the order/s in concern are subjected

to any irregularities, illegalities, or improprieties.

Kulatilake v Attorney General (2010) 1 SLR 212 p. 215 held that Court

would exercise the revisionary jurisdiction, it being an extraordinary power

vested in Court specially to prevent miscarriage of justice being done to a person

and or for the due administration of justice.

As enunciated in Attorney General vs. Ranasinghe and others (1993) 2 SLR

p.81, the revisionary power of the Court can be exercised for the following

purposes:

1. To satisfy this Court as to the legality of any sentence or order passed

by the High Court or Magistrates Court

2. To satisfy this Court as to the proprietary of any sentence or order

passed by such Court.

3. To satisfy this Court as to regularity of the proceedings of such Court.

At the outset, it must be highlighted that revision is a discretionary remedy

that will only be invoked in exceptional circumstances that have been

submitted. In the case of Abdul Hassan Mohamed Kaleel v

Mohamed Kaleel Mohamed Imithiyas CA/PHC/APN/141/16 CA Minute

dated 25.01.2017 at page 6, His Lordship Justice L. T. B. Dehideniya after

considering several authorities expressed the view that; Thus the existence of

exceptional circumstances is the process by which the Court selects the cases

5

CA-CPA- 131-21 Page 5 of 6 04/04/2023 IJ-19-23

in respect of which this extra-ordinary method of rectification should be

adopted. If such a selection process is not there, revisionary jurisdiction of this

Court will become a gateway for every litigant to make a second appeal in the

garb of a revision application or to make an appeal in situations where the

legislature has not given right of appeal. The practice of the Court to insist on

the existence of exceptional circumstances for the exercise of revisionary powers

has taken deep root in our law and has got hardened into a rule which should

not be lightly disturbed. The words used by the legislature do not indicate that

it ever intended to interfere with this 'rule of practice. (Emphasis added).

Nevertheless, the accused-appellant petitioner through the revision

application to this Court has failed to satisfy the court of any valid exceptional

circumstance to pivot the said orders.

Through the revision application made to this Court, the counsel for the

accused-appellant petitioner stressed over the fact that the learned Magistrate

had erred in stating that the fatal accident took place due to the accused-

appellant petitioner negligently driving in high speed.

The evidence given by witnesses including the accused-appellant and the 3rd

passenger of the vehicle, both stated that the road they were travelling seemed

to be wet and that they saw something like a stone ahead of the vehicle. And

when the accused-appellant was trying to avoid it, the accident took place,

and the vehicle slipped away, knocked, and toppled over.

Reflecting the evidence of the witnesses this Court too is of the opinion that if

the accused-appellant was driving in a controllable speed, he could have

avoided the stone in a conscientious manner and further could have avoided

the accident too.

Considering all facts and evidence of the present case it is clear the learned

Magistrate in delivering the order has correctly examined all aspects of the

case prior to the conviction of the accused-appellant petitioner. Further, the

compensation ordered in this case can be considered as a nominal amount

and thus cannot be claimed as excessive. Thus, in the circumstances this

Court does not find any irregularities, illegalities, or improprieties in the said

6

CA-CPA- 131-21 Page 6 of 6 04/04/2023 IJ-19-23

order of the learned Magistrate dated 03/02/2020 nor in the affirmed order

by the learned High Court judge dated 10/12/2021.

Accordingly, this Courts finds no reason to interfere with the order of the

learned Judge of the Gampaha High Court dated 10/12/2021 and order of

the learned Magistrate of Attanagalla dated 03/02/2020. Thereby, this Court

affirms the same.

The application is hereby dismissed.
