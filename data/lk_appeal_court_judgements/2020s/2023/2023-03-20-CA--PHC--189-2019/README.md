Before: Menaka Wijesundera J.

Neil Iddawala J.

Counsel: Ashan Fernando for the Appellant.

Hansa Abeyratne, SC for the State.

Argued on: 07.02.2023

Decided on: 22.03.2023

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to set aside the order

dated 10.9.2019 of the High Court of Gampaha.

The appellant in the instant matter had been arrested by the police on

10.7.2013 for allegedly possessing Wallapatta and facts had been

reported to the Magistrate. But on 22.9.2016 the police had informed

the Magistrate that a charge sheet would not be filed against the suspect

and to discharge him, and as such the Magistrate had discharged the

suspect.

But on the 24.8.2017 the Attorney General had instructed the police to

file a charge sheet against the suspect for the same offence he was taken

into custody for.

But the appellant had objected on the basis that the appellant had been

discharged by the Magistrate previously and as such he cannot be

charged, in fact the Magistrate should have acquitted the suspect, he had

submitted.

The Magistrates had overruled the objection and had proceeded to trial

and being aggrieved by the said order the appellant had made an

application for revision to the High Court and the learned High Court

Judge had held with the Magistrate.

The instant application is against the said orders.

The appellant in the submissions made orally and in writing had taken

the same position and the Attorney General had objected to the

application.

Upon consideration of the submissions of both sides it is pertinent to

note the manner in which legal proceedings are commenced before the

Magistrate.

Under chapter XIV of the Criminal Procedure Code, it is stated that

criminal proceedings commences before the Magistrate once a plaint

and charge sheet is filed.

But in the instant matter when the Magistrate made the order for the

suspect to be discharged on 22.9.2016 there had been no charge sheet

or plaint filed against the suspect. Hence the Magistrate could not have

acquitted the suspect because he was only a suspect and not an accused.

Therefore, it is the considered view of this Court that there was no bar

for the Attorney General to have instructed the police to file charges

under the relevant act against the suspect and for the learned Magistrate

to have accepted the same.

As such we see no irregularity or an illegality in the order of the learned

High Court Judge in holding with the Magistrate.

As such we dismiss the instant application for revision as it carries no

merit.

I agree.
