Argued on: 24.01.2023

Decided on: 02.03.2023

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to obtain bail to suspect namely

Maeharas Kabiraj alias Kaviraj under the Provisions of the Assistance to

and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses act.

Page 3 of 4

The suspect had been produced under the instant act for allegedly

threatening a witness in the case of B1747-2020 on 26.3.2021 and as

the Magistrate has no jurisdiction to enlarge the suspect on bail he had

been remanded.

The suspect has no previous convictions but has one pending case.

The investigations are not yet over and the indictment is also not being

prepared.

The main contention of the Counsel for the suspect was the delay in any

meaningful action being taken against the suspect.

The Counsel for the Respondents raised one concern for the granting of

bail the fact that the suspect had been evading arrest in the substantial

matter.

The law pertaining to this matter is that a suspect produced and

remanded under this act can be granted bail only upon exceptional

circumstances by the Court of Appeal, and the term exceptional has not

been defined in the act but our legal literature has held that

exceptionality has to be determined by the facts of each case.

As such we observe that the suspect had been in remand now for nearly

two years without any meaningful action being taken against him.

As such we are of the opinion that it is only but fare to enlarge the

above mentions suspect on bail and we direct the learned Magistrate to

enlarge the above mentioned suspect on suitable conditions of bail.

As such the instant application for bail is allowed.
