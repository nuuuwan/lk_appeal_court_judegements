Introduction

[1] This is an appeal by way of Stated Case against the determination made by the

Tax Appeals Commission dated 28.06.2019 confirming the determination made by

the Respondent dated 10.04.2015 and dismissing the appeal of the Appellant. The

taxable periods related to this Appeal are from January 2010 to December 2010.

Factual Background

[2] The Appellant is a Public Limited Liability Company in Sri Lanka and it carried

on the business of general insurance and life insurance in Sri Lanka. The business

of the Appellant is regulated by the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act, No. 43 of

2000 (as amended). The Appellant submitted monthly VAT returns for the above-

mentioned taxable periods from January 2010 to December 2010. The Appellant

claimed that it is not liable to pay VAT on the supply of financial services under

section 25F of the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002 (as amended) on the basis

that the value addition on business of life insurance is expressly exempted from

VAT on financial services in terms of item (x) (i) of Part II (b) of the First Schedule

to the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002 (as amended (hereinafter referred to

as the VAT Act) and that the business of life insurance is not specifically

enumerated in section 25F of the VAT Act so as to constitute a chargeable

financial service. [3] The assessor by letter dated 02.04.2013 refused to accept the returns on the

ground that various types of interest income declared in the audited accounts of

the Appellant fall under section 25F of the VAT Act and therefore the Appellant is

liable to pay VAT on financial services under Chapter IIIA of the VAT Act (Vide-pp.

10-14 of the TAC brief). Accordingly, VAT on the supply of financial services was

calculated by the assessor for the taxable periods from 01.01.2010-31.12.2010 and

the asssessments were issued.

Appeal to the Respondent and the Tax Appeals Commission

3 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

[4] The Appellant appealed to the Respondent against the said assessments and

the Respondent by its determination dated 10.04.2015 (Vide-page 80 of the TAC

brief) confirmed the assessments issued by the assessor. The reasons for the

determination are contained at pp.60-75 of the TAC brief).

The decision of the Tax Appeals Commission

[5] Being dissatisfied with the said determination of the Respondent, the Appellant

appealed to the Tax Appeals Commission and the Tax Appeals Commission by its

determination dated 28.06.2019 confirmed the determination of the Respondent

and dismissed the appeal. The Tax Appeals Commission (hereinafter referred to as

the TAC) held:

1. The assessments issued by the assessor are valid in law, and the assessor

having given reasons for non-acceptance of assessments, duly communicated

his reasons to the Appellant;

2. The Treasury Bills and Bonds raise Rupee Loans to the Government of Sri Lanka

under the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance, No. 8 of 1923 and the Registered

Stocks and Securities Ordinance, No. 7 of 1937 and the Repo or Repurchase

Agreements are also issued for raising short term finance and used by the

Central Bank as instruments of monitary policy to expand money supply;

3. The interest income earned by the Appellant from the investments in Treasury

Bills and Bonds, Repo or Repurchase Agreements is an integral part of the

Appellants business and thus, it could be treated as a business income of the

Appellant;

4. The investments made in Treasury Bills and Bonds and Repo come within the

definition of supply of financial services under section 25F of the VAT Act.

Appeal to the Court of Appeal

[6] Being aggrieved by the decision of the TAC, the Appellant appealed to the

Court of Appeal and formulated the following Nine Questions of Law in the case

Stated for the opinion of the Court of Appeal.

1. Is the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission time barred?

2. Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law when it came to the conclusion

that the Appellant was liable to pay Value Added Tax on financial service?

4 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

3. Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law when it concluded that the

Appellant was liable to pay Value Added Tax on financial services but did

not quantify the Appellants liability in terms of the Act by taking into

consideration section 25(5)(a) and (c) of the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of

2002, as amended?

4. Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law by concluding that the

Appellant is involved in the supply of financial services in terms of section

25A(1) read with section 25F of the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002, as

amended?

5. Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law in failing to consider that the

Appellant is involved in solely in the insurance business which is an industry

strictly regulated by the provision of the Regulation of Insurance Industry

Act, No. 43 of 2000 as amended?

6. Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law in failing to consider that the life

insurance business of the Appellant is exempted from VAT?

7. Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law in failing to consider that the

investment of the Appellant of the life insurance policy holders monies in

Treasury Bills and other similar instruments is to ensure security for the

policy holder and not as granting the loan to the Government?

8. Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law in failing to consider that the

amount invested by the Appellant from and out of the life insurance policy

holders fund is tied to and payable to the said policy by way of contract?

9. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, did the Tax Appeals

Commission err in law when it came to the conclusion that it did?

Question of Law No. 1

Time bar of the determination made by the Tax Appeals Commission

[7] At the hearing, Mr. Nihal Fernando submitted that section 10 of the Tax

Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 as last amended by the Tax Appeals

Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013, stipulates that the TAC shall make

its determination within two hundred and seventy days from the date of the

Commission commencing its sittings for the hearing of each appeal. He submitted

that the amendment of section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of

2011 with retrospective effect on two occasions and having an avoidance of doubt

clause in section 15 of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of

2013 makes it very clear that the intention of Parliament is that section 10 as

amended, is a mandatory provision of law which requires strict compliance.

5 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

[8] He further submitted that though the first date of hearing of the appeal as per

the TAC proceedings was 10.01.2017, the determination of the TAC was made on

28.06.2019 and thus, the determination has been made more than 270 days (two

years and 171 days) from the date of the first oral hearing, which is outside the

period specified in section 10 for the determination of the appeal. His contention

was that the TAC is no longer possessed of jurisdiction to continue hearing of the

appeal and the determination is time barred by operation of law.

[9] He further submitted that the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 (as

amended) was intended to be a mandatory provision of law and required strict

compliance and the directory provision would not have required an amendment

with retrospective effect and the avoidance of doubt provision found in section 15

of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011, if the time bar stipulated in

section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, as amended, was intended to be

directory.

[10] Mr. Fernando relied on the following statement made by His Lordship

Gooneratne J. in Mohideen v. Commissioner -General of Inland Revenue (CA 2/2007

(20-15) Vol. XXI. BASL Law Journal, page 171 decided on 16.01.2014, referring to

the statutory time bar applicable to the Board of Review to make a determination

under the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 37 of 2003 at p. 176:

If specific time limits are to be laid down, the legislature needs to say so in very clear and unambiguous terms instead of leaving it to be interpreted in various ways. To give a restricted interpretation would be to impose unnecessary sanctions on the Board of Review. It would be different or invalid if the time period exceeded two years from the date of oral hearing. If that be so, it is time barred. [Emphasis added]

[11] Mr. Nihal Fernando submitted that while the statement of Gooneratne J.

regarding the applicability of the time bar would not constitute part of the ratio

decidendi for this decision, it nevertheless constitutes a relevant judicial dicta

which sheds light on the issue, but it cannot be regarded as a mere obiter dicta

statement. He submitted that in this context, the statement of Janak de Silva, J. in

Stafford Motor Company Limited v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,

CA /Tax/17/2017, decided on 15.03.2019, Kegalle Plantations PLC v. Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue, CA/Tax 09/2017 decided on 04.09.2014 that the

statement of Gooneratne, J. is an obiter dicta statement is erroneous. He relied on

the decisions in D.M.S. Fernando v. A.M. Ismail (1982) IV Reports of Sri Lanka Tax

6 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

Cases 184 and Sampanthan v. Attorney General SC FR 351/2018 decided on

13.12.2018 in particular, in support of his submissions.

[12] On the other hand, Mr. Milinda Gunetilleke submitted that the Court of

Appeal in Mohideen v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra),

considered the question of the actual date of hearing intended by Parliament in

the second proviso to Section 140 (10) of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act,

No. 37 of 2003, for the purpose of the time limit of the appeal decided by the

Board of Review. He submitted that the Court held in Mohideen v. Commissioner-

General of Inland Revenue (supra), that the hearing means the date of the actual

oral hearing, which constitutes ratio decidendi and that the statement made by

Gooneratne J. was only obiter dicta, and not ratio decidendi. He submitted that the

Tax Appeals Commission Act does not spell out any sanction for the failure on the

part of the TAC to comply with the time limit set out in section 10 of the Act. His

contention was that the word shall in section 10 does not necessarily mean that

the provision is mandatory unless non-observance will result in the object of the

provision being frustrated and the sanction is statutorily spelled out in the Tax

Appeals Commission Act.

[13] Mr. Gunetilleke, relied on the decisions in Stafford Motor Company Limited v.

The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra), Kegalle Plantations PLC v.

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra), Visuvalingam v. Liyanage 1983 (1)

Sri LR 203, Amadeus Lanka (Private) Limited v. Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (CA/Tax/04/2019 decided on 30.07.2021), Valibel Lanka (Pvt) Ltd v.

Director General of Customs and 13 others decided on 29.08.2008 in support of his

submissions.

[14] His Lordship Janak de Silva J., referring to Mohideen v. Commissioner-General

of Inland Revenue (supra), held in Stafford Motor Company Limited v. The

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra) that the statement made by His

Lordship Gooneratne J. was an obiter dicta statement at p. 6 as follows:

We are of the view that the statement in Mohideens case (supra) that the determination of the Board of Review is invalid if not made within the statutory time period is obiter dicta. Accordingly, we are of the view that the determination of the TAC in the instant case is not time barred. In Kegalle Plantations PLC v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue [CA (TAX) 09/2017, C.A.M. 04.09.2018] we arrived at a similar conclusion.

[15] In Kegalle Plantations PLC v. The Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue

(supra) and CIC Agri Business (Private) Limited v. The Commissioner-General of

7 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

Inland Revenue (CA/Tax 42/2014 decided on 29.05.2021), His Lordship Janak de

Silva J. arrived at a similar conclusion.

Analysis

Statutory Provisions

[16] The time limit for the determination of the appeal by the TAC was originally

contained in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011, which

stipulated that the Tax Appeals Commission shall make the determination within a

period of one hundred and eighty days from the date of the commencement of

the hearing of the appeal. It reads as follows:

The Commission shall hear all appeals received by it and make its decision in

respect thereof, within one hundred and eighty days from the date of the

commencement of the hearing of the appeal.

[17] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act was amended by section 7 of

the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 4 of 2012, which stipulated

that the determination of the Commission shall be made within two hundred and

seventy days. In terms of section 13 of the said Act, the amendment was to have

retrospective effect and was deemed to have come into force from the date of the

Principal Act (i.e. 31.01.2011). Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act was

further amended by section 7 of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act,

No. 20 of 2013, which stipulated that the determination of the Commission shall

be made within two hundred and seventy days from the date of the

commencement of its sittings for the hearing of each such appeal. In terms of

the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 4 of 2012 (s. 13) and the Tax

Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013 (s. 14), the amendments

made to the provision of section 10 were given retrospective effect.

[18] Section 15 of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013

further provides an avoidance of doubt clause as follows:

For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby declared, that the Commission shall have the power in accordance with the provisions of the principal enactment as amended by this Act, to hear and determine any appeal that was deemed transferred to the Commission under section 10 of the principal enactment, notwithstanding the expiry of the twelve months granted for its determination by that section prior to its amendment by this Act.

8 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

[19] Accordingly, section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 as

last amended by the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013

now provides as follows:

The Commission shall hear all appeals received by it and make its determination in respect thereof, within two hundred and seventy days from the date of the commencement of its sittings for the hearing of each such appeal:

Provided that, all appeals pending before the respective Board or Boards of Review in terms of the provisions of the respective enactments specified in Column I of Schedule I, or Schedule II to this Act, notwithstanding the fact that such provisions are applicable to different taxable periods as specified therein shall with effect from the date of coming into operation of the provision of this Act be deemed to stand transferred to the Commission, and the Commission shall notwithstanding anything contained in any other written law make its determination in respect thereof, within twenty four months from the date on which the Commission shall commence its sittings for the hearing of each such appeal.

[20] In the present case, Mr. Nihal Fernando conceded that the statement made by

Gooneratne J. in Mohideen v. The Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra)

would not constitute a ratio decidendi, but it is a relevant judicial dicta which

cannot be regarded as a mere obiter statement. Thus, it is not in dispute that the

statement of Gooneratne J. is not a ratio decidendi for the present case. The

relevance of the statement must be, however, considered in the context of the

facts and the circumstances of the case and the relevant legal provisions that

existed at that time.

Mandatory and Directory Provisions

[21] I shall now proceed to consider the submission of Mr. Nihal Fernando,

referring to the word shall in section 10 that the time bar in section 10 of the Tax

Appeals Commission Act is a mandatory provision of law which requires strict

compliance. Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Act stipulates that the TAC shall make

its determination within 270 days from the date of the commencement of its

sittings for the hearing of the appeal. Superficially, the effect of non-compliance of

a provision is dealt with in terms of the mandatory-directory classification.

Generally, in case of a mandatory provision, the act done in breach thereof is void,

whereas, in case of a directory provision, the act does not become void, although

some other consequences may follow (P.M. Bakshi, Interpretation of Statutes, First

Ed, 2008422).

9 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

[22] In my view, the use of the word shall does not always mean that the

provision is obligatory or mandatory as it depends upon the context in which the

word shall occurs, and the other circumstances as echoed by the Indian Supreme

Court case of The Collector of Monghyr v. Keshan Prasad Goenka, AIR 1962 SC 1694

at p. 1701) in the following words:

It is needless to add that the employment of the auxiliary verb " shall" is inconclusive and similarly the mere absence of the imperative is not conclusive either. The question whether any requirement is mandatory or directory has to be decided not merely on the basis of any specific provision which, for instance, sets out the consequence of the omission to observe the requirement, but on the purpose for which the requirement has been enacted, particularly in the context of the (1) [1958] S.C.R. 533, other provisions of the Act and the general scheme thereof. It would, inter alia, depend on whether the requirement is insisted on as a protection for the safeguarding of the right of liberty of a person or of property which the action might involve.

[23] It is well-established that an enactment in form mandatory, might in

substance be directory and that the use of the word shall does not conclude the

matter (Hari Vishnu Kamath v Ahmad Ishaque AIR 1955 SC 233 referring to Julius v.

Bishop of Oxford (1880) 5 A.C. 214 HL). Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission

Act does not say what will happen if the Commission fails to make the

determination within the time limit specified in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 (as amended). Mr. Fernando, referring to the five-

judge decision of D.M.S. Fernando and another v. A.M. Ismail (1982) IV Reports of

Sri Lanka Tax Cases 184, 193 submitted that penal consequences need not be laid

down in order for a provision to be held mandatory and that in such case, the

Court has to consider the natural consequences that would follow where

Parliament had not prescribed a sanction for breach of a mandatory provision. He

referred to the proposition of law that was lucidly explained by Samarakoon C.J, at

pp.184, 190 wherein His Lordship stated as follows:

The statute itself contains no sanction for a failure to communicate reasons. If it had the matter would be easy of decision. But the matter does not rest there. One has to make a further inquiry. If it appears that Parliament intended disobedience to render the Act invalid, the provision in question is described as mandatory, imperative or obligatory; if on the other hand, compliance was not intended to govern the validity of what is done, the provision is said to be directory (Halsburys Laws of England, Ed 3 Vol. 36-page 434 S. 650). Absolute provisions must be obeyed absolutely whereas directory provisions may be fulfilled substantially (Vide- Woodward vs Sarson (1875) (L.R.10 cp

10 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

733 at 746). No universal rule can be laid down for determining whether a provision is mandatory or directory. It is the duty of Courts of Justice to try to get at the intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the Statute to be construed per Lord Campbell in Liverpool Borough Bank vs Turner (1860) (2 De CF. & J 502 at 508) Vita Food Products vs. Unus Shipping Co. (1939 A.C. 377 at 393). Each Statute must be considered separately and in determining whether a particular provision of it is mandatory or directory one must have regard to the general scheme to the other sections of the Statute. The Queen vs. Justices of the County of London County Council (1893) 2 Q.B. 476 at 479). It is also stated that considerations of convenience and justice must be considered. Pope vs. Clarke (1953) (2 A.E.R. 704 at 705). Then again, it is said that to discover the intention of the Legislature it is necessary to consider-(1) The Law as it stood before the Statute was passed. (2) The mischief if any, under the old law which the Statute sought to remedy and (3) the remedy itself. (Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, Edition 12 page 160). These are all guidelines for determining whether Parliament intended that the failure to observe any provision of a Statute would render an act in question null and void. They are by no means easy of application and opinions are bound to differ. Indeed, some cases there may be where the dividing line between mandatory and directory is very thin. But the decision has to be made. I will therefore examine the Statute bearing in mind these guidelines.

[24] I agree with Mr. Fernando that the absence of any provision does not

necessarily follow that the statutory provision is intended by the legislature to be

disregarded or ignored. Where the sanction for not obeying them in every

particular statute is not prescribed, the Court must judicially determine them to

ascertain whether the legislature intended that the failure to observe any provision

of a Statute would render an act null and void, or leave it intact (see also, N.S.

Bindras Interpretation of Statute, 10th Ed. p. 1013).

Legislative Intent

[25] The question as to whether a statute is mandatory or directory is a question

which has to be adjudged in the light of the intention of the Legislature as

disclosed by the object, purpose and scope of the statute. If the statute is

mandatory, the act or thing done not in the manner or form prescribed can have

no effect or validity, and if it is directory, a penalty may be incurred for non-

compliance, but the act or thing done is regarded as good (P.M. Bakshi,

Interpretation of Statutes, p. 430 & Mohanlal Ganpatram v. Shri Sayaji Jubliee

Cotton and Jute Mills Co. Ltd AIR 1966 Guj. 96). In State of U.P., v. Baburam

Upadhya, AIR 1961 SC 751, the Supreme Court of India stated that when a statute

uses the word shall, prima facie, it is mandatory, but the Court may ascertain the

11 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

real intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the

statute. Crawford on Statutory Construction (Ed. 1940, Art. 261, p. 516) sets out

the following passage from an American case approvingly as follows:

"The question as to whether a statute is mandatory or directory depends upon the intent of the legislature and not upon the language in which the intent is clothed. The meaning and intention of the legislature must govern, and these are to be ascertained, not only from the phraseology of the provision, but also by considering its nature, its design, and the consequences which would follow from construing it the one way or the other".

[26] According to Sutherland, Statutory Construction, Third Ed. Vol. III, p. 77:

The difference between mandatory and directory statutes is one of effect only. The question generally arises in a case involving a determination of rights as affected by the violation of, or omission to adhere to statutory directions. This determination involves a decision of whether or not the violation or omission is such as to render invalid Acts or proceedings to the statute, or rights, powers, privileges claimed thereunder. If the violation or omission is invalidating, the statute is mandatory, if not, it is directory.

[27] Then, the question is this: What is the fundamental test that is to be applied in

determining whether or not the failure to obey the time bar provision in section 10

of the Tax Appeals Commission Act was intended by the legislature to be

mandatory or directory? This question ultimately depends on the consideration of

whether the consequences of the non-compliance were intended by the

legislature to be mandatory or directory. This proposition was echoed by Lord

Woolf MR (as he then was) in R v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p

Jeyeanthan [2000] 1 WLR 354, who stated that it is "much more important to focus

on the consequences of the non-compliance". He elaborated this proposition in

the following words at p. 360:

In the majority of cases, whether the requirement is categorised as directory or mandatory, the tribunal before whom the defect is properly raised has the task of determining what are to be the consequences of failing to comply with the requirement in the context of all the facts and circumstances of the case in which the issue arises.

[28] Here, it is also desirable to remember the words of Lord Hailsham of St.

Marylebone L.C. in his speech in London and Clydeside Estates Ltd. v. Aberdeen

District Council [1980] 1 W.L.R. 182 , 188190. He stated at p. 36:

12 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

"The contention was that in the categorisation of statutory requirements into mandatory and directory, there was a subdivision of the category directory into two classes composed (i) of those directory requirements substantial compliance with which satisfied the requirement to the point at which a minor defect of trivial irregularity could be ignored by the court and (ii) those requirements so purely regulatory in character that failure to comply could in no circumstances affect the validity of what was done.

When Parliament lays down a statutory requirement for the exercise of legal authority, it expects its authority to be obeyed down to the minutest detail. But what the courts have to decide in a particular case is the legal consequence of non-compliance on the rights of the subject viewed in the light of a concrete state of facts and a continuing chain of events.

[29] In Howard and Others v. Bodington (1877) 2 PD 203, the Court of Arches

considered the question whether the consequences of a failure to comply with a

statutory requirement are mandatory or directory. Lord Penzance stated at pp.

211-212:

Now the distinction between matters that are directory and matters that are imperative is well known to us all in the common language of the courts at Westminster. I am not sure that it is the most fortunate language that could have been adopted to express the idea that it is intended to convey; but still, that is the recognised language, and I propose to adhere to it. The real question in all these cases is this: A thing has been ordered by the legislature to be done. What is the consequence if it is not done? In the case of statutes that are said to be imperative, the Courts have decided that if it is not done the whole thing fails, and the proceedings that follow upon it are all void. On the other hand, when the Courts hold a provision to be mandatory or directory, they say that, although such provision may not have been complied with, the subsequent proceedings do not fail. Still, whatever the language, the idea is a perfectly distinct one. There may be many provisions in Acts of Parliament which, although they are not strictly obeyed, yet do not appear to the Court to be of that material importance to the subject-matter to which they refer, as that the legislature could have intended that the non-observance of them should be followed by a total failure of the whole proceedings. On the other hand, there are some provisions in respect of which the Court would take an opposite view, and would feel that they are matters which must be strictly obeyed, otherwise the whole proceedings that subsequently follow must come to an end.

[30] In the absence of any express provision, the intention of the legislature is to

be ascertained by weighing the consequences of holding a statute to be directory

or mandatory having regard to the importance of the provision in relation to the

13 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

general object intended to be secured by the Act (Caldow v. Pixcell (1877) 1 CPD

52, 566) & Dharendra Kriisna v. Nihar Ganguly (AIR 1943 Cal. 266). As held

in Attorney General's Reference (No 3 of 1999), the emphasis ought to be on the

consequences of non-compliance, and asking the question whether Parliament

can fairly be taken to have intended total invalidity.

[31] Now the question is, to which category, does section 10 in this case

belong? The question as to whether section 10 is mandatory or directory depends

on the intent of the legislature, and not upon its language, irrespective of the fact

that section 10 is couched in language which refers to the word shall. The

intention of the legislature must be ascertained not only from the phraseology of

section 10, but also by considering its purpose, its design and more importantly,

the consequences which would follow from construing it one way of another. It is

necessary to ask the question: What is the consequence of the failure to adhere to

the time limit specified by section 10 that has been intended by the legislature to

be categorised as mandatory or directory? That is how I would approach this

question, which is ultimately a question of statutory construction of section 10 of

the Tax Appeals Commission Act. Accordingly, one has to identify the tests to be

applied in deciding whether a provision is to be regarded as mandatory or

directory, and then apply them to the statute which stipulates the determination

shall be made within the time limit specified therein, but makes no reference to

any penal consequences.

Consequence of non-compliance with a statutory provision

[32] In considering a procedural requirement from this angle, a Court is likely to

construe it as mandatory if it seems to be of particular importance in the context

of the enactment, or if it is one of a series of detailed steps, perhaps in legislation

which has created a novel jurisdiction (Warwick v. White (1722) Bunb. 106; 145 E.R.

612) or if non-compliance might have entailed penal consequences for one of the

parties (State of Jammu and Kashmir v. Abdul Ghani (1979) Ker LJ 46). Where the

disobedience of a provision is made penal, it can safely be said that such provision

was intended by the legislature to be mandatory (Seth Banarsi Das v. The Cane

Commissioner & Another, AIR 1955 All 86). As noted, the fact that no penal

consequence is stated in a statute, however, is only one factor to be considered

towards a directory construction, and there are other factors to be considered in

determining whether a provision of a statute is mandatory or not. One of the

factors in determining whether the consequence of non-compliance provision was

intended by the legislature to be mandatory or directory is to consider the broad

14 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

purpose and object of the statute as Lord Penzance stated in Howard v. Bodington

(supra) at 211 as follows:

I believe, as far as any rule is concerned, you cannot safely go further than that in each case you must look to the subject-matter: consider the importance of the provision that has been disregarded, and the relation of that provision to the general object intended to be secured by the Act; and upon a review of the case in that aspect decide whether the matter is what is called imperative or only directory.

Purpose of the section in the context of the statute

[33] The legislature is a purposive act, and judges should construe statutes to

execute that legislative purpose, intent and context (Robert A. Katzmann, Judging

Statutes 31 (2014) by focusing on the legislative process, taking into account the

problem that the legislature was trying to solve (Henry M. Hart, Jr. & Albert M.

Sacks, The legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law

1182 (William N. Eskridge, Jr. & Phillip P. Frickey Eds., (1994). We must thus,

ascertain what the legislature was trying to achieve by amending the Tax Appeals

Commission Act twice as far as the time bar is concerned. Mr. Fernando contended

that, given the tax law context, a strict approach to the construction of section 10

of the Tax Appeals Commission Act should be adopted as the amendment of the

Tax Appeals Commission Act with retrospective operation twice would reflect the

legislative intent that the compliance with section 10 is mandatory. He argued that

if the time bar stipulated in section 10 was intended to be directory, the

amendment of section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act with retrospective

effect on two occasions, and the avoidance of doubt clause found in section 15 of

the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013 would have been

superfluous.

[34] Will the amendment of section 10 with retrospective operation twice manifest

the intention of the legislature that the failure of the TAC to make its

determination within the time limit specified in section 10 is mandatory? From

section 15, it is manifest that the legislature intended section 10 to operate

retrospectively, so that the date of the commencement of section 10 is earlier than

the date of that amendment. A legislative intention to amend section 10 with

retrospective operation does not necessarily or conclusively mean that the failure

to make the determination of the TAC within the time limit specified in section 10

is mandatory. If such drastic consequence was really intended by the legislature, it

would have made appropriate provisions in express terms in section 10 to the

15 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

effect that the appeal shall be deemed to have been allowed where the Tax

Appeals Commission fails to adhere to the time limit specified in section 10 of the

Tax Appeals Commission Act.

[35] There are guidelines in tax statutes, which stipulate that the failure to observe

any time limit provision would render the appeal null and void or that the appeal

shall be deemed to have been allowed. For example, Section 165 (14) of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended), provides that an appeal preferred to

the Commissioner-General shall be agreed to, or determined by the

Commissioner-General within a period of two years from the date on which such

petition of appeal is received.... The same section specifically stipulates that

where such appeal is not agreed to or determined within such period, the appeal

shall be deemed to have been allowed and tax charged accordingly.

[36] An identical provision is contained in section 34 (8) of the VAT Act, No. 14 of

2002 as well, which stipulates that where such appeal is not agreed to, or

determined within such period, the appeal shall be deemed to have been allowed

and the tax charged accordingly. Although the Tax Appeals Commission Act was

amended by Parliament twice and increased the period within which the appeal is

to be determined by the Commission from 180 days to 270 days with retrospective

effect, the legislature in its wisdom did not specify any penal consequence or any

other consequence of non-compliance of the time bar specified in section 10 of

the Tax Appeals Commission Act. Had the legislature intended that the non-

compliance with section 10 to be mandatory, it could have easily included a

provision with negative words requiring that an act shall be done in no other

manner or at no other time than that designated in the section or a provision for a

penal consequence or other consequence of non-compliance. This proposition

was echoed by FOTH, C. J. in the Supreme Court of Kansas decision in Paul v. The

City of Manhattan, 511 P.2d (1973) 212 Kan. 381, paragraph 17 as follows:

The language of the enactment itself may provide some guidance. Thus, we said in Shriver v. Board of County Commissioners, 189 Kan. 548, 370 P. 2d 124, Generally speaking, statutory provisions directing the mode of proceeding by public officers and intended to secure order, system and dispatch in proceedings, and by a disregard of which the rights of parties cannot be injuriously affected, are not regarded as mandatory, unless accompanied by negative words importing that the acts required shall not be done in any other manner or time than that designated. (p. 556. Emphasis added). A critical feature of mandatory legislation is often a provision for the consequences of

16 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

non-compliance. This element was noticed by early legal commentators, for in Bank v. Lyman, supra, we find this observation (p. 413).

[37] Bindras Interpretation of Statutes, 10th Ed., referring to the decision of Paul v.

The City of Manhattan (supra), states that factors which would indicate that the

provisions of a Statute or Ordinance are mandatory are: (1) the presence of

negative words requiring that an act shall be done in no other manner or at no

other time than that designated; or (2) a provision for a penalty or other

consequence of non-compliance (p. 433). The legislature in its wisdom has placed

time limit for the speedy disposal of appeals filed before the Commissioner-

General and the overall legislative intention sought to be attained by the Inland

Revenue Act in section 165 (14) was to ensure that an appeal before the

Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue is disposed of within a period of 2 years

from the date on which the Petition of Appeal is received. As the Commissioner-

General is an interested party against another interested party (tax payer) in the

tax collection, it shall determine the appeal within 2 years from the receipt of the

Petition of Appeal, and if not, the appeal shall be deemed to have been allowed

and tax charged accordingly, so as to safeguard the rights of the taxpayer

[38] Mr. Fernando referred to the following statement made by H.N.J. Perera CJ in

the majority judgment of seven judge bench of the Supreme Court in Sampanthan

v. Attorney General (supra). Wherein the Supreme Court stated:

Next, it is to be kept in mind that the task of interpreting a statute must be done within the framework and the wording of the statute and in keeping with the meaning and intent of the provisions in the statute. A Court is not entitled to twist or stretch or obfuscate the plan and clear meaning and effect of the words in a statute to arrive at a conclusion which attracts the Court.

[39] In identifying the legislative intention, it is necessary to consider the

amendments made to the Tax Appeals Commission Act, to ascertain whether the

provision of section 10 was intended to be mandatory by the legislature for the

purpose of the application of the proposition of law made in Sampanthan v.

Attorney General (supra). The object sought to be attained by section 10 of the Tax

Appeals Commission Act has been designed primarily, to expedite the appeal

process filed before the TAC, which was established by an Act of Parliament

comprising retired Judges of the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal and those

who have gained wide knowledge and eminence in the field of Taxation.

[40] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 granted time

to the TAC to hear all appeals within one hundred and eighty days from the date

17 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

of the commencement of the hearing of the appeal. The Tax Appeals Commission

(Amendment) Act, No. 4 of 2012 extended the said time period from one hundred

and eighty days to two hundred and seventy days from the date of the

commencement of the hearing of the appeal. The Tax Appeals Commission

(Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013 however, reduced the time limit granted to the

TAC to conclude the appeal by enacting that the time specified in section 10 shall

commence from the date of the commencement of its sittings for hearing the

appeal. The legislature has, from time to time, extended and reduced the time

period within which the appeal shall be determined by the TAC, but it intentionally

and purposely refrained from imposing any consequence for the failure on the

part of the TAC to adhere to the time limit specified in section 10.

[41] The legislature amended the Tax Appeals Commission Act twice with

retrospective effect, and provided time frames to conclude appeals quickly as

possible within the time limit of 270 days from the date of the commencement of

its sittings for the hearing of such appeal. It is true that the legislature has

amended section 10 with retrospective operation but if it intended to take away

the jurisdiction of the TAC, and render its determination made outside the time

limit specified in section 10 invalid, it could have easily made, with retrospective

effect, appropriate provision in express terms that the appeal shall be deemed to

have been allowed or other consequence of non-compliance.

[42] It is settled law that Courts cannot usurp legislative function under the

disguise of interpretation and rewrite, recast, reframe and redesign the Tax

Appeals Commission Act, because this is exclusively in the domain of the

legislature. This proposition was lucidly explained by Lord Simonds in Magor and

St Mellons Rural District Council v. Newport Corporaion [1951] 2 All ER 839, HL.

Referring to the speech of Lord Denning MR, Lord Simonds said at page 841: It

appears to me to be a naked usurpation of the legislative function under the thin

disguise of interpretation, Lord Simonds further stated at 841:

The duty of the court is to interpret the words that the legislature has used; those words may be ambiguous, but, even if they are, the power and duty of the court to travel outside them on a voyage of discovery are strictly limited. If a gap is disclosed, the remedy lies in an amending Act and not in a usurpation of the legislative function under the thin disguise of interpretation.

[43] The same proposition was echoed by Arijit Pasayat, J. in the Indian Supreme

Court case of Padmasundara Rao and Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors. AIR

(2002) SC 1334, at paragraph 14, as follows:

18 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

14. While interpreting a provision, the Court only interprets the law and

cannot legislate it. If a provision of law is misused and subjected to the abuse of

process of law, it is for the legislature to amend, modify or repeal it, if deemed

necessary.

[44] On the other hand, the proviso to Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission

Act, No. 23 of 2011 granted time for the Commission to make its determination in

respect of appeal transferred to the Commission from the Board of Review within

a period of one hundred and eighty days (180) from the date of such transfer,

notwithstanding anything contained in any other written law. The Tax Appeals

Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 4 of 2012 extended the said time period from

one hundred and eighty days to twelve months of the date on which the

Commission shall commence its sittings. (Vide-Section 7 of the Act, No. 4 of 2012).

The Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013 extended the said

time period to twenty-four months from the date on which the Commission shall

commence its sittings for the hearing of each such appeal.

[45] It is crystal clear that these procedural time limit rules in respect of appeals

received by the Tax Appeals Commission or appeals transferred from the Board of

Review to the Commission have been devised by the legislature to facilitate the

appeal process by increasing and reducing the time period within which such

appeals shall be concluded. The provision for the determination of an appeal by

the TAC within a period of 270 days from the commencement of its sittings for the

hearing of an appeal has been designed with a view to regulating the duties of the

TAC by specifying a time limit for its performance as specified in section 10 of the

Act. So that the legislature, in its wisdom has made provision in section 10 to the

effect that the appeal shall be disposed of speedily within a period of 270 days

from the date of the commencement of the sittings for the hearing of the appeal.

But the legislature imposed no drastic and painful penal consequence or other

consequence of non-compliance, including prohibitory or negative words in

section 10, rendering the determination of the appeal null and void for non-

compliance of the time limit specified in section 10. In my view, they are not

intended to make the parties suffer from the failure of the Commission to make

the determination within the time limit specified in section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act.

[46] Any procedural retrospective operation of a provision, in my view, cannot take

away the rights of parties who have no control over those entrusted with the duty

19 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

of making determination within the time limit specified in section 10. The

retrospective operation of section 10 without any penal or other consequence of

non-compliance, by itself, cannot be treated as a factor in determining that the

legislature intended that the failure to adhere to the time limit specified in section

10 is mandatory.

Avoidance of doubt clause

[47] Mr. Fernando, further relied on the avoidance of doubt clause in Section 15 of

the Tax Appeals Commission Act to argue that section 15 would be rendered

nugatory if the provisions of section 10 are considered to be directory. A perusal

of section 15 of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013

reveals that it relates to appeals that have been transferred to the Commission

from the Board of Review, and provides that the TAC shall have the power to make

a determination in respect thereof, beyond twelve months granted for its

determination of appeals by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 23 of 2011.

[48] It seems to me that the avoidance of doubt clause in section 15 applies to

appeals transferred from the Board of Review and not to new appeals directly filed

before the TAC. On the other hand, the intention of the legislature in section 15 is

to empower the Commission to hear an appeal transferred to it by the Board of

Review under section 10 of the Act, notwithstanding the expiry of the twelve

months granted for its determination by the Tax Appeals (Amendment) Act, No. 4

of 2012. It seems to me that section 15 manifests that the legislature never

intended that the time period specified in the general scheme of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act to be mandatory, and holding otherwise, would not promote the

main object of the legislature reflected in the Act.

Consequences of non-compliance with a statute by those entrusted with

public duty

[49] The other important factor that is necessary to consider, whether a provision

is mandatory or directory is to find as to who breached the time limit specified in

section 10-whether it was breached by one of the parties to the action, or by those

entrusted with the performance of a public duty. Also coming under this head are

cases where the Court will take into account the practical inconveniences or

impossibilities of holding a time limit requirement to be mandatory where the

public duty is performed by a public body. If the statutory provision relates to the

performance of a public duty, the Court is obliged to consider whether any

20 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

consequence of such breach would work serious public inconvenience, or injustice

to the parties who have no control over those entrusted with such public duty.

[50] The Tax Appeals Commission Act has imposed a duty on the TAC to make the

determination within the time limit specified in section 10. However, it is to be

noted that the parties had no control over those entrusted with the task of

making the determination within the time limit specified in section 10. Should the

parties who have no control over those entrusted with the task of making the

determination be made to suffer for any failure or delay on the part of the TAC in

not making its determination within the time limit specified in Section 10? I do not

think that the legislature intended that the time limit specified in section 10 is

mandatory where the parties had no control over those entrusted with the task of

making the determination within the time limit specified in section 10.

[51] Maxwell, Interpretation of Statute, 11th Ed. at page 369 referring to the

ascertaining of the intention of the legislature in relation to the interpretation of

limitation provision states:

On the other hand, where the prescriptions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and where the invalidation of acts done in neglect of them would work serious general inconvenience or injustice to persons who have no control over those entrusted with the duty without promoting the essential aims of the Legislature, such prescriptions seem to be generally understood as mere instructions for the guidance and government of those on whom the duty is imposed, or, in other words, as directory only. The neglect of them may be penal, indeed, but it does not affect the validity of the act done in disregard of them. It has often been held, for instance, where an Act ordered a thing to be done by a public body or public officers and pointed out the specific time when it was to be done, then the Act was directory only and might be complied with after the prescribed time. [Emphasis added]

[52] Where the statute imposes a public duty on persons and to treat, as void, acts

done without compliance with the statute would cause serious inconvenience to

persons who have no control over those entrusted with this duty, then the practice

is to hold the provision to be directory only so as not to affect the validity of such

action taken in breach of such duty (Montreal Street Rly. Co. v. Normandin (1917)

AC 170, 175). Lord Sir Arther Channell echoed this proposition in that case at p.

176 as follows:

When the provisions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and the case is such that to hold null and void acts done in neglect of this duty would work serious general inconvenience, or injustice to persons who have no

21 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

control over those entrusted with the duty, and at the same time would not promote the main object of the Legislature, it has been the practice to hold such provisions to be directory only, the neglect of them, though punishable, not affecting the validity of the acts done. This principle has been applied to provisions for holding sessions at particular times and places (2 Hale, P. C., p. 50, Rex v. Leicester Justices (1827) 7 B & C. 6 and Parke B. in Gwynne v. Burnell (1835) 2 Bing. N.C. 7); to provisions as to rates (Reg. v. Inhabitants of Fordham (1839) 11 Ad. & E. 73 and Le Feuvre v. Miller (1857) 26 L.J. (M.C.) 175); to provisions of the Ballot Act (Woodward v. Sarsons (1875) L.R. 10 C.P. 733

and Phillips v. Goff (1886) 17 Q.B.D. 805); and two justices acting without having taken the prescribed oath, whose acts are not held invalid (Margate Pier Co. v. Hannam (1819) 3 B. & Al. 266).

[53] This proposition is further confirmed by Sutherlands Statutory Construction,

Third Ed. Vol. 3. at p. 102 as follows:

A statute specifying a time within which a public officer is to perform an official act regarding the rights and duties of others is directory unless the nature of the act to be performed, or the phraseology of the statute, is such that the designation of time must be considered a limitation of the power of the Officer. At p. 107 it is pointed out that a statutory direction to private individuals should generally be considered as mandatory and that the rule is just the opposite to that which obtains with respect to public officers. Again, at p. 109, it is pointed out that often the question as to whether a mandatory may be directory construction should be given to a statutory provision may be determined by an expression in the statute itself of the result that shall follow the non-compliance with the provision....

[54] In the present case, the duty to make the determination within the time limit

specified in Section 10 is statutorily entrusted to the members of the TAC in terms

of the provisions of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 (as

amended), and the parties had no control whatsoever, over the TAC. As Lord Sir

Arther Channell put it correctly, it would cause the greatest injustice to both

parties who had no control over those entrusted with the duty of making the

determination, if we hold that the neglect to observe the time limit specified in

section 10 of the statute renders the determination made by the Commission ipso

facto null and void.

[55] In my view, every limitation period within which an act must be done, is not

necessarily a prescription of the period of limitation with painful and drastic

consequences and the parties who have no control of those entrusted with a

statutory duty and no fault of them should not be made to suffer and lose their

rights for the failure to adhere to the time limitation specified in a provision.

22 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

[56] In Visuvalingam v. Liyanage [(1985) 1 Sri LR 203], the Supreme Court was

called upon to consider the question whether the time limit of two months set out

in Article 126 (5) of the Constitution is mandatory or directory. The Supreme Court

by a majority decision held that the provisions of Article 126 (5) of the Constitution

are merely directory and not mandatory. Samarakoon, C.J stated at page 226 that:

An examination of the relevant provisions of the Constitution indicates that the provision is merely directory......These provisions confer a right on the citizen and a duty on the Court. If that right was intended to be lost because the Court fails in its duty, the Constitution would have so provided. It has provided no sanction of any kind in case of such failure. To my mind it was only an injunction to be respected and obeyed, but fell short of punishment if disobeyed. I am of the opinion that the provisions of Article 126 (5) are directory and not mandatory. Any other construction would deprive a citizen of his fundamental right for no fault of his. While I can read into the Constitution a duty of the Supreme Court to act in a particular way I cannot read into it any deprivation of a citizens guaranteed right due to circumstances beyond his control

[57] Although the decision in Visuvalingam v. Liyanage (supra) was a case of

infringement of the fundamental rights of a citizen, in my view, the rationale of

the statement of Samarakoon C.J. equally applies to the facts of the present case.

The decision in Visuvalingam v. Liyanage (supra) is further confirmed by

Sharvananda J. (as he then was) in Nagalingam v. Lakshman de Mel (78 NLR 231),

which is not a fundamental right case. The question before His Lordship was

whether the provisions of section 2 (2) (c) of the Termination of Employment of

Workmen (Special Provisions) Act, No. 45 of 1971 are mandatory or directory. His

Lordship Sharvananda J. (as he then was) stated at page 237:

The object of the provision relating to time limit in section 2(2)(c) is to discourage bureaucratic delay. That provision is an injunction on the Commissioner to give his decision within the 3 months and not to keep parties in suspense. Both the employer and the employee should, without undue delay, know the fate of the application made by the employer. But the delay should not render null and void the proceedings and prejudicially affect the parties, as the parties have no control over the proceedings. It could not have been intended that the delay should cause a loss of the jurisdiction that the Commissioner had, to give an effective order of approval or refusal. In my view, a failure to comply literally with the aforesaid provision does not affect the efficacy or finality of the Commissioners order made thereunder. Had it been the intention of Parliament to avoid such orders, nothing would have been simpler than to have so stipulated.

23 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

[58] If we interpret the legislative intent of Section 10 from its mere phraseology,

without considering the nature, purpose, the design, the absence of consequences

of non-compliance and practical impossibility, which would follow from construing

it one way or the other, it will tend to defeat the overall object, design, the

purpose and spirit of the Tax Appeals Commission Act. If we hold that the

determination of the Commission is null and void, it will cause serious injustice to

parties who have no control over those entrusted with the duty of discharging

functions under the Tax Appeals Commission Act.

[59] For those reasons, I hold that having considered the facts and he

circumstances and legal principles, the failure to adhere to the time limit specified

in section 10 was not intended by the legislature to be mandatory with painful and

drastic consequences of rendering such determination null and void. The directory

interpretation of section 10 is consistent with the object, purpose and design of

the Tax Appeals Commission Act, which is reflected in the intention of the

legislature.

[60] With regard to the relevance of the judicial dicta referred to by Mr. Fernando

in Mohideen v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra), it is to be noted

that the relevant question of law No. 2 in respect of which the above statement

was made by Gooneratne J. in Mohideen v. Commissioner-General of Inland

Revenue (supra) reads as follows:

Has the Board of Review erred in law by violating the spirit and intentions of the first proviso to section 140 (10) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 (as amended by Section 52 of Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 37 of 2003), which makes it imperative that the Board of Review arrives at its determination within two years of the commencement of the hearing of this appeal?

[61] Section 140 (10) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 (as amended) by

Section 52 of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 37 of 2003 contains 2

provisos, and the intention as regards time limit is reflected in the second proviso

to section 140 (10), which reads as follows:

Provided, however, the Board shall make its determination or express its opinion as the case may be, within two years from the date of commencement of the hearing of such appeal.

[62] It is to be observed that unlike in the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No.

37 of 2003, which had given a period of almost 2 years to the Board of Review

to conclude an appeal from the date of commencement of the hearing, the

24 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

legislature in section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 (as

amended), has reduced the period within which determination shall be made by

the Tax Appeals Commission viz. 270 days from the commencement of its sittings

for the hearing of the appeal.

[63] The Appellant in Mohideen v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra)

has referred to the Budget speech made by the Minister in charge of the subject

while presenting the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 37 of 2003 in

Parliament, wherein, a reference has been made that The final settlement of

questions of fact, including the Board of Review will be within 04 years (Vide- p.

176). Based on the Budget speech, the Appellants main argument in Mohideen v.

Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra) as regards the time bar, has been

reproduced by His Lordship Gooneratne J. referring to paragraphs 2 and 4 of the

written submissions of the Appellant as follows:

3. Therefore, the clear legislative intention was to ensure that an appeal against an assessment is disposed of within a total period of four years (i.e. two years for the appeal to be determined by the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue and two further years for the appeal to be determined by the Board of review resulting in a total period of four years).; 4.The instant appeal was taken up for an oral hearing only on 17.02.2006 which is almost 6 years since it was filed. It is submitted that the definition of the word hearing as used in the second proviso to section 140 (10) must be interpreted having regard to the legislative intention of disposing of matters before the Board of Review speedily. It would be contrary to the legislative intention (and the Board of Review would be at liberty to make even twenty-five years before orally hearing an appeal) if the operation date for the commencement of the time bar was construed to be the date of the oral hearing....

[64] Based on the said written submissions, His Lordship Gooneratne J. identified

and referred to the Appellants main point for the determination of the Court at

page 177 of the judgment as follows:

The Appellants view is that commencement of the time bar will operate from the date on which he submitted to the jurisdiction of the Board. That would be according to the Appellant on receipt of the Petition of Appeal by the Board and not from the date of the oral hearing. Emphasis on this point is by reference to 140 (10) of Act No. 38 of 2000. As such Appellant submits it is the intention of the legislature that all of it should be concluded in 2 years and in the instant case it took 6 years since filing the petition. [Emphasis added]

25 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

[65] Referring to section 140 (10), His Lordship Gooneratne J. states as follows:

Based on Section 140 of the Act, No. 38 of 2000, the legislature intended the

word hearing to mean an oral hearing; .........

Section 140 (10) provides that the Board shall confirm, reduce, increase or annul the assessment after the hearing of the Appeal. It is therefore patently evident that the word hearing used consistently in Section 140 of Act No. 38 of 2000 means an oral hearing and no more.

[66] It is manifest that the main argument advanced by Dr. Shivaji Felix before

Gooneratne J. was that as the legislative intention was to dispose of both appeals

within a total period of four years and the time limit of 2 years will begin to

operate from the date on which the Petition of Appeal is received by the Board

of Review and not from the date of the oral hearing. It is crystal clear that the

issue before His Lordship Gooneratne J. was whether the legislature intended that

the hearing used in the second proviso to section 140 (10) of the Inland Revenue

Act, No. 38 of 2000 (as amended), for the calculation of a two-year time period

commences from the date of the oral hearing as contended by the State or from

the date of the Petition of Appeal received by the Board of Review as contended

by Dr. Shivaji Felix. His Lordship Gooneratne J. answered this question at pp. 176-

177 as follows:

It is very unfortunate that it took almost 6 years or more to reach its conclusion from the date of filing the Petition of Appeal in the Board. But the oral hearing commenced on 21.06.2006. This of course is well within the time limit and I would go to the extent to state that the Board has been very conscious of early disposal of the appeal. Board cannot be faulted for getting the appeal fixed for hearing as stated above since it is the duty and function of the Secretary of the Board to fix a date and time for hearing and to notify the parties. If it was the intention of the legislature that hearing should be concluded within 2 years from the date of filing the petition or that the time period of 2 years begins to run from the date of filing the petition, there could not have been a difficulty to make express provision, in that regard. I do agree with the view of the State Counsel. Hearing no doubt commences from the date of oral hearing. I would as such answer this question in favour of the Respondent and endorse the view of the Board of Review. It is not time barred as the Board arrived at the determination within 2 years. [Emphasis added]

[67] It is crystal clear that His Lordship Gooneratne J. flatly rejected the argument

of Dr. Shivaji Felix that the legislature intended that the hearing should be

concluded within 2 years from the date of filing the petition of appeal or that

the time period of 2 years begins to run from the date of filing the petition

26 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

of appeal. His Lordship Gooneratne J. was not prepared to be guided by the

Budget Speech made by the Minister in charge of the subject and hold with the

Appellant that the legislative intention was that the hearing should be concluded

within 2 years from the date of the filing of the petition of appeal.

[68] For those reasons, His Lordship Gooneratne J. having considered the question

involved (Question No. 2) held with the Respondent on the basis that the hearing

for the calculation of time limit of 2 years specified in section 140 (10) commences

from the date of the oral hearing and not from the date of filing the petition of

appeal. In my view, the principle laid down by Gooneratne J. in Mohideen v.

Commissioner General Inland Revenue (supra) was that the hearing for the purpose

of time limits of 2 years specified in the second proviso to Section 140 (10) of the

Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 37 of 2003 commences from the date of

the oral hearing and no more.

[69] That was the principle upon which the case was decided by His Lordship

Gooneratne J. which represents the reason and spirit of the decision and that part

alone is the principle which forms the only authoritative element of a precedent in

Mohideen v. Commissioner General Inland Revenue (supra). Having laid down the

principle upon which the case shall be determined on the Question of Law No. 2,

His Lordship Gooneratne J. proceeded further to consider the facts of the case and

found that the hearing commenced on 17.02.2006 and the determination was

made by the Board on 21.06.2006 and therefore, the determination was made

within the time limit specified in the said proviso. Thus, His Lordship answered the

question No. 2 in favour of the Respondent in the following manner:

I would in answer to this question of law, hold that the Board has not erred by arriving at its determination the way it was done in this appeal (p. 177).

[70] After having answered the Question of Law, No. 2 in favour of the Respondent

and while fully endorsing the proposition of law that the hearing contemplated in

the said time bar provision is nothing but oral hearing and thus, the time bar of 2

years ought to be calculated from the date of the oral hearing, His Lordship made

some remarks with regard to the need of adopting a practical and meaningful

interpretation to the day-to-day functions in a court of law and statutory bodies.

His Lordship remarked that where specific time limits are to be laid down, the

legislature has to say so in very clear, unambiguous terms instead of leaving it to

be interpreted in various ways. Then, as a passing remark which was not the

principle upon which the issue was answered in favour of the Respondent,

Gooneratne J. says that It would be different or invalid if the time period exceeded

27 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

2 years from the date of oral hearing. If that be so, it is time barred. The relevant

passage at page 176 reads as follows:

As such in the context of this case and by perusing the applicable provision, it seems to me that the hearing contemplated is nothing but oral hearing. One has to give a practical and meaningful interpretation to the usual day to day functions or steps in a court of law or a statutory body involved in quasi-judicial functions, duty or obligation. If specific time limits are to be laid down, the legislature needs to say so in very clear, unambiguous terms instead of leaving it to be interpreted in various ways. To give a restricted interpretation would be to impose unnecessary sanctions on the Board of Review. It would be different or invalid if the time period exceeded 2 years from the date of oral hearing. If that be so, it is time barred.

[71] Obviously, the last sentence of the passage was not the principle upon which

the issue was finally decided in favour of the Respondent in Mohidden v.

Commissioner General Inland Revenue (supra) that forms part of the reason and

spirit of the decision as the authoritative element of the decision. The point in

Question of Law No. 2 was decided against the Appellant who argued that the

time limit of 2 years ought to be calculated from the date of the receipt of the

Petition of Appeal by the Board and not from the date of oral hearing.

[72] That part of the statement enunciated by His Lordship Gooneratne J. that it

would be different or invalid if the time period exceeded 2 years from the date of

oral hearing. If that be so, it is time barred is a passing observation, in the form of

an assumption or hypothesis unaccompanied by the principle upon which the case

was decided in favour of the Respondent, is manifestly an obiter and not the ratio

having a binding authority.

[73] On the other hand, His Lordship Gooneratne J. was never called upon to go

into the factors, whether or not the second proviso to Section 140 (10) of the

Inland Revenue Act could be regarded as mandatory or directory, having regard to

the nature, purpose and the design of the statute, the consequences that may flow

from non-compliance, if the act is not done within that period. So, those factors

were not considered by His Lordship Gooneratne J. in Mohideen v. Commissioner-

General of Inland Revenue (supra). Also not called upon and not considered are the

factors such as whether or not the non-compliance is visited with some penalties,

or the statute provides for a contingency of non-compliance of the time limit

provision or any practical inconvenience and injustice to parties who have no

control over those entrusted with a statutory duty and deprivation of their

statutory rights at their no fault.

28 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

[74] In the light of the above discussion, I am of the opinion that, the portion of

the statement of Gooneratne J. in question cannot have the character of a ratio

decidendi but a mere casual statement or observation or remark which does not

form the part of the legal principle upon which the case was decided and thus, it

has no authoritative value.

[75] For those reasons, I have no reasons to disagree with the decisions of Janak

de Silva, J. in Stafford Motor Company Limited v. The Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue (supra) and Kegalle Plantations PLC v. Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue (supra). For those reasons, I am in agreement with the reasoning

of His Lordship Janak de Silva J. in the above-mentioned decisions that the

statement of His Lordship Gooneratne J. in Mohideen v. Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue (supra) is obiter dicta statement and the time limit specified in

section 10 is not intended to be mandatory.

[76] We took the same view in our judgments in Mr. S.P. Muttiah v. The

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,CA/TAX/46/2019,decided on 26.06.2021

and Amadeus Lanka (Pvt) Ltd v. CGIR (C.A Tax 4/19 decided on 30.07.2021. In Mr.

S.P. Muttiah v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra), we further

held that If we interpret the legislative intent of Section 10 from its mere

phraseology, without considering the nature, purpose, the design, the absence of

consequences of non-compliance and practical impossibility, which would follow

from construing it one way or the other, it will tend to defeat the overall object,

design, the purpose and spirit of the Tax Appeals Commission Act (pp77-78). We

further held that the directory interpretation of section 10 is consistent with the

object, purpose and design of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, which is reflected

in the intention of the legislature. We held that if a gap is disclosed in the

Legislature, the remedy lies is an amending Act, and not in a usurpation of the

legislative function under the thin disguise of interpretation.

[77] For those reasons, I hold that the determination of the Tax Appeals

Commission in the present case is not time barred and thus, I answer the Question

of Law No. 1 in favour of the Respondent.

Questions of Law Nos. 2-9

[78] The questions of law, 2-9 are closely connected to each other and therefore,

they will be dealt with together in this judgment. Mr. Nihal Fernando submitted

that for the Appellant to fall within the charging section (s. 25A of the VAT Act),

29 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

must satisfy two requirements, namely, (i) the Appellant should provide a financial

service as defined in section 25F; and (ii) such financial service should be carried

on in the course of business of supplying financial services. His main arguments

included: (i) the Appellant is neither a finance company nor a bank providing

finance services within the meaning of the VAT Act; (ii) the Appellant is neither

involved in the business of supplying financial services nor provided any of the

financial services contemplated in section 25F of the VAT Act; (iii) the Appellant is

only engaged in insurance business, and its life insurance business is highly

statutorily regulated business under and in terms of the Regulation of Insurance

Industry Act, No. 43 of 2000 (as amended); (iv) the life insurance business that

comprises the investment of policy holders premium income in securities and

other similar instruments; (v) the life insurance is not a financial service within the

contemplation of section 25F of the VAT and the life insurance is exempted from

VAT in terms of item (x) (i) of Part II(b) of the First Schedule to the VAT Act; (vi) A

portion of life insurance cannot be subject to VAT on financial services and the

Appellant is not liable to pay VAT on financial services in respect of the interest

income received from the investment of the policy holders premium income in

securities and other similar instruments.

[79] On the other hand, Mr. Milinda Gunetilleke, whilst conceding that life

insurance aspect of the Appellants business is exempt from VAT submitted that

nevertheless, the interest income received by the Appellant from the activities

identified by the assessor, falls within the meaning of the provision of loan,

advance or credit in section 25F(g) of the VAT Act. He further submitted that none

of the activities identified by the assessor form part of the life insurance business,

but part of investment income received from government securities and other

similar instruments. His contention was that all interest income received from

financial activities in question could be treated as supply of financial services

falling within loans, advance or credit subject to VAT on financial services under

section 25F of the VAT Act.

The issues before Court

[80] It is not in dispute that the Appellant is engaged in the insurance business

carrying on both life and general insurance and that the general insurance

business is subject to VAT. The main issues related to the questions of law in the

case stated, which needed to be addressed by this Court were as follows:

30 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

1. (a) Whether the life insurance is a supply of financial service within the

meaning of section 25F, in particular section 25F(g) of the VAT Act;

(b) Whether the Appellant could be held to be a person carrying on the

business of supplying financial services under section 25A(2) read with section

25F of the VAT Act;

(c) Whether the life insurance is exempt from VAT in terms of item (i) Part II

of the First Schedule to the VAT Act;

2. Whether the Appellant is prevented from engaging in the business of financial

services in view of the regulatory framework in terms of the Regulation of

Insurance Industry Act, No. 43 of 2000 without prior approval of the Insurance

Board and if so, whether the Appellant carried on the business of supplying

financial services within the meaning of section 25A(2) of the VAT Act;

3. (a) Whether the life insurance business involves an investment element and if

so, whether the interest income received by the Appellant from investment in

securities and other similar instruments is part of the life insurance business,

which is exempt from VAT on financial services in terms of item (i) Part II of the

First Schedule to the VAT Act;

(b) Whether the investments in question are ancillary or associated with the

insurance business which can be classified as financial services and if so,

whether such activities are an integral part of the business income of the

Appellant;

(c) If so, whether for the purpose of VAT on financial services, the value

addition attributable to investment income earned by investing in insurance

premiums is considered a taxable supply of financial services as per section

25(C) of the VAT Act.

Analysis

The applicable law

[81] The scope for the imposition of VAT is provided for in section 2 of the VAT

Act. Section 2 of the VAT Act provides that, subject to the provisions of the VAT

Act, the Value Added Tax (VAT) shall be charged-

31 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

(a) at the time of supply, on every taxable supply of goods or services made in a

taxable period, by a registered person in the course of the carrying on, or, or

carrying out , of a taxable activity by such person in Sri Lanka;

(b) on the importation of goods into Sri Lanka, by any person,

and on the value of such goods or services supplied or the goods imported, as

the case may be subject to the provision of section 2A, at the rates morefully

specified in the said section. [82] In terms of section 2 of the VAT Act, in order to render the relevant supply of

goods and services liable to VAT, the said supply has to be a taxable supply of

goods and services made by a registered person and made in the course of

carrying out a taxable activity. The terms supply of goods, taxable supply and

taxable activity are defined in section 83 of the VAT Act.

VAT on Financial Services

[83] The case is, however, concerned about the imposition of VAT on the supply of

financial services under Chapter IIIA of the VAT Act. To examine the argument of

Mr. Nihal Fernando, that the life insurance business with an investment element is

exempt from VAT on financial services, it is relevant to consider the statutory

provisions of the VAT Act, and the categories of persons liable to pay VAT on

financial services. The VAT on financial services is imposed as a direct tax, and the

imposition of VAT on the supply of financial services by specified institutions was

first introduced by the VAT (Amendment) Act, No. 7 of 2003 by inserting in section

25 of the VAT Act, a new subsection, 25A. Section 25A applied to the imposition of

VAT on the supply of financial services initially by specified institutions. It reads as

follows:

(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter I, II, III and item (xi) of the First Schedule to this Act, a Value Added Tax (hereinafter in this Chapter referred to as the Tax) shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter with effect from January 1, 2003, on the supply of financial services in Sri Lanka, made by any specified institution which carries on a business of supplying such financial services.

Categories of Persons liable to pay VAT on Financial Services

[84] Section 25A of the VAT Act was further amended by the VAT (Amendment)

Act, No. 13 of 2004 by expanding the imposition of VAT on the supply of financial

32 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

services by any person. Accordingly, the imposition of VAT on the supply of

financial services applies to a specified institution and any person. Section 25A (1)

of the VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002 as amended by the VAT (Amendment) Act. No. 13

of 2004 now reads as follows:

25A(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter I, II, III and item (xi) of the First Schedule to this Act, a Value Added Tax (hereinafter in this Chapter referred to as the Tax) shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter on the supply of financial services in Sri Lanka-

(i) by any specified institution during the period commencing January 1, 2003 and ending on June 30, 2003; and

(ii) by any person on or after July 1, 2003 but prior to December 31, 2007;

(iii) by any person other than a Co-operative Society registered under the Co-operative Society Law, No. 5 of 1972, on or after January, 1, 2008 but prior to January, 2009; and

(iv) by any person other than a Co-operative Society registered under the Co-operative Societies Law No. 5 of 1972 or Lady Lochore Loan Fund established under the Act No. 38 of 1951, commencing on or after January 1. 2009, or the Central Bank of Sri Lanka established by the Monetary Law Act (Chapter 422) (with effect from Julay 1, 2003). [Emphasis Added].

Provided however, the supply of financial services by a Unit Trust or a Mutual Fund shall not be treated as a financial service for the purpose of this section.

[85] A person includes a company or a body of persons (Vide- section 83 of the

vAT Act) and therefore, the Appellant is captured within the meaning of section 83

of the VAT Act for the purpose of section 25A(1)(ii). It is manifest that for the time

period relevant to this case, and subject to the aforesaid three exceptions, and

other specific exemptions, all persons including any specified institution and any

person are liable to pay VAT on financial services.

Is the Appellant a specified institution?

[86] Now, the first question is whether or not, the Appellant is a specified

institution who carries on the business of supplying financial services within the

meaning of Section 25F of the VAT Act, to be liable to pay VAT on financial

services. Section 25F defines a specified institution which includes a finance

33 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

company registered under the Finance Companies Act, No. 78 of 1988. In terms of

Section 25F, a specified institution broadly means-

(a) a licensed commercial bank within the meaning of the Banking Act, No. 30 of

1988;

(b) a finance company registered under the Finance Companies Act, No. 78 of

1988;

(c) a licensed specialized bank within the meaning of the Banking Act, No. 30 of

1988.

[87] It is not in dispute that the Appellant is not a licensed commercial bank or a

finance company or a licensed specialized bank within the meaning of section 25F

of the VAT Act. Admittedly, the Appellant is an insurance company engaged in

general and life insurance business within the meaning of the Regulation of

Insurance Industry Act, No. 43 of 2000 (as amended). Mr. Gunatilleke however,

argued that the Appellant is still a person carrying on the business of supplying

financial services within the meaning of section 25F(g) of the VAT Act and,

therefore, the Appellant is liable to pay VAT on financial services within the

meaning of section 25A(1) of the VAT Act. The next question is to decide whether

the Appellant is still a person carrying on the business of supplying financial

services and therefore, the Appellant is liable to pay VAT on financial services

within the meaning of section 25A(1) of the VAT Act.

[88] To make the Appellant liable to pay VAT on financial services, under the

second head of the charging section, viz, section 25A(1)(ii), it must be satisfied

that the Appellant is a person who is carrying on the business of supplying

financial services. The second head was introduced by the VAT (Amendment) Act

No. 13 of 2004 and the relevant portion of section 25A(1) after the amendment in

2004 section 25A(1) reads as follows:

on the supply of financial services in Sri Lanka-

(i) by any specified institution during the period commencing January 1, 2003 and ending on June 30, 2003; and (ii) by any person on or after July 1, 2003,

where such specified institution or person carries on the business of

supplying such financial services.

34 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

[89] Section 25G of the VAT Act was also introduced by the VAT (Amendment) Act,

No. 13 of 2004, which applies to the periods of assessment in this case, and thus,

any person should carry on the business of supplying financial services, which

reads as follows:

Where any person carries on the business of supplying financial services, the preceding provisions of this Chapter, shall mutatis mutandis apply, to and in relation to the supply of such services made by such person on or after July 1,2003.

[90] It is relevant to note that section 25A(2) of the VAT (Amendment) Act further

provides that the VAT on financial services applies to any specified institution or a

person carrying on the business of financial services. It reads as follows:

25A(2). Every specified institution or other person, carrying on the business of supplying of any financial services in Sri Lanka, shall be required to be registered

[91] The twofold elements to be satisfied for the imposition of VAT on the supply

of financial services by specilised Institutions or by any person under Chapter IIIA

of the VAT Act are the following:

1. The Appellant supplied/provided a financial service as defined under section

25F of the VAT Act; and

2. Such financial service was supplied in the course of the business of supplying

financial services.

Is the Appellant a person carrying on the business of supplying financial

services within the meaning of section 25A(1)(ii) of the VAT Act.

VAT on Supply of Financial Services

[92] The next point is to consider whether the income assessed by the assessor

falls within the definition of supply of financial services and if not, whether it is

outside the ambit of the VAT on Financial Services. Based on the audited

statement of accounts of the Appellant for the year 2011/2012 has identified the

following net profits as supply of financial services under section 25F:

1. Interest income on repurchase of Treasury Bills;

2. Interest income on repurchase of Treasury Bonds;

3. Interest income on Treasury Bills;

35 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

4. Interest income on Bonds;

5. Interest income on Debentures;

6. Interest income on Unquoted debentures;

7. Interest income on policy loans;

8. Penalty Interest income on insurance Housing Loans;

9. Interest on insurance Housing Loans;

10. Interest on Raksana Sevana;

11. Penalty Interest insurance on Raksana Sevana;

12. Interest income on Loans to Field Staff;

13. Interest income on on Loans to Office Staff;

14. Interest earned on Sri Lanka Development Bonds;

15. Unrealized Gain on Foreign Currency Conversions.

[93] Now the question is whether the interest income received by the Appellant

from those activities is for the supply of financial services and if so, whether such

income was received by the Appellant while carrying on the business of supplying

financial services. Mr. Nihal Fernando conceded that the insurance business

constitutes a financial service, but it is not a financial service within the meaning of

section 25F of the VAT Act as set out in Chapter IIIA of the VAT Act. [95] Section

25F of the VAT Act exclusively defines the transactions or activities that fall within

the meaning of supply of financial services. It reads as follows:

25F. For the purposes of this Chapter-

supply of financial services means- (a) the operation of any current, deposit or savings account;

(b) the exchange of currency;

(c) the issue, payment, collection or transfer of ownership of any note, order for

payment, cheque or letter of credit ;

(d) the issue, allotment, transfer of ownership, drawing, acceptance, or endorsement

of any debt, security, being any interest in or right to be paid money owing by

any person other than the transfer of nonperforming loans of a licensed

Commercial Bank to any other person in terms of a re-structuring scheme of

such bank as approved by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka with the concurrence of

the Minister;

(e) the issue, allotment, transfer of ownership of any equity security or a

participatory security;

36 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

(f) issue, underwriting, sub-underwriting or subscribing of any equity security, debt

security or participatory security;

(g) the provision of any loan, advance or credit;

(h) the provision-

(a) of the facility of instalment credit finance in a hire purchase conditional sale

or credit sale agreement for which facility a separate charge is made and

disclosed to the person to whom the supply is made;

(b) goods under any hire purchase agreement or conditional sale or hire

purchase agreement while have been used in Sri Lanka for a period not less

than twelve months as at the date of such agreement.

[94] The TAC referring to section 25F of the VAT Act states that the investments

made by the Appellant in Treasury Bills, Bonds, Repo and other securities are

integral part of the financial business of the Appellant and the interest income

received from such investments comes under the supply of financial services

defined in section 25F of the VAT Act. Further, the TAC stated that the interest

income received by the Appellant from such investments could be treated as a

business income of the Appellant. The relevant findings of the TAC at pp 243-245

of the TAC brief are as follows:

As submitted by the Representative for the Respondent, it is to be noted that whether the investment income to be treated as a business income will depend on the nature of the business. If the nature of the business is such that making of investment is an integral part of the business, so as to establish a strong link between the investment and liabilities to be met, it is possible to conclude that interest income earned from such investments could comprise of the business income. When a bank or an insurance company make investments to receive interest, such interest income could be used to meet the commitments of their customers. In this case, the magnitude of the amount received by the SLIC as interest income, will no doubt that it could be treated as a business income..

Therefore, the purpose of government in issuing Treasury Bills and Bonds is to obtain a loan and not merely to create an investment opportunity to Banks or any other investors. Treasury Bills and Bonds are considered as, investments as they do not bear any credit risk because of the sovereign guarantee. Commercial Banks and Insurance Companies and other financial institutions purchase these debt instruments issued by the Government in order to maintain an optimum balance between risk and return and to maintain liquidity position of those companies. Such transactions are made by these Companies in the course of carrying in or carrying out the normal business.

37 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

In view of the foregoing, the contention of the Appellant that interest income on Treasury Bills, Treasury Bonds and Repo are not coming under the supply of financial services is not tenable. Therefore, these transactions fall under the definition of supply of financial services set out in section 25F of the VAT Act.

Exemption of life insurance from VAT

[95] Now, I desire to consider the question whether the life insurance business is

specifically excluded from the supply of financial services as defined in section 25F

of the VAT Act. Mr. Nihal Fernando, submitted that in terms of item (x) (i) of Part II

(b) of the First Schedule to the VAT Act, life insurance was specifically excluded

and when VAT on financial services was introduced, the legislature deliberately

reproduced all items from item (a) to (h) of (x) of Part II(b) of the First Schedule. He

submitted, however, that the legislature deliberately left them out and did not

reproduce the item (i) of (x) of Part II (b) of the First Schedule, namely the life

insurance. His contention was that the legislature did not intend to define life

insurance business as part of supply of financial services under section 25F of the

VAT Act.

[96] Mr. Gunetilleke, however, argued that after the VAT on financial services was

introduced by the VAT (Amendment) Act, No. 7 of 2003 and further amended by

the subsequent VAT (Amendment) Act, No. 13 of 2004, VAT on financial services

applied notwithstanding the provisions of Chapters I, II and III and item (xi) of

the First Schedule. He argued that what was taxable as financial services under

Chapter IIIA of the VAT Act is not defined in section 25F of the VAT Act and,

therefore, the activities in subparagraphs (a) to (g) are taxable as financial services,

notwithstanding the fact that these same items appear under item (xi) in Part I of

Schedule 1. In view of Mr. Gunetillekes submission that VAT on financial services

applied to the Appellant notwithstanding the provisions of Chapters I, II, III and

item (xi) of the First Schedule, it is necessary to consider whether the exemption

for life insurance set out in item (x) (i) of Part II(b) of the First Schedule is

inapplicable to life insurance.

[97] Section 8 of the VAT Act provides that the supply of goods and services in the

First Schedule to the VAT Act are not taxable unless zero rated under section 7.

Prior to the introduction of the VAT on financial services, item (xi) (i) of the First

Schedule to the VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002 excluded life insurance, Agrahara

Insurance and crop and livestock insurance from VAT. VAT on financial services

38 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

was however, introduced by the VAT (Amendment) Act, No. 7 of 2003 (See

Chapter IIIA and section 25A of the VAT Act (as amended). By the VAT

(Amendment) Act, the First Schedule was divided into two Parts that dealt with

the commencement and ending of the two taxable periods. Item (xi) Part I of the

First Schedule to the VAT Act deals with taxable periods commencing from on or

after August 1,2002 and ending prior to January 2004, and item (xi) of Part II of the

First Schedule deals with taxable periods commencing on or after January 1, 2004.

(See VAT (Amendment) Act, No. 13 of 2004). The relevant taxable periods in the

present case are from January 2011 to December 2011 and hence, it is Part II of

the First Schedule that applies to this case.

[98] Item (x) (i) of Part II (b) of the First Schedule to the VAT Act, (as amended)

specifically exempts, inter alia, the life insurance from VAT liability. The relevant

part of the First Schedule to the VAT Act reads as follows:

PART II

For any taxable period commencing on or after January 1, 2004-

(a) (b) The supply of .. (x)..

(i) the life insurance, Agrahara insurance and crop and livestock insurance.

[99] It is crystal clear that VAT on financial services is not specifically enumerated

in section 25F of the VAT Act as an item of financial services so as to constitute a

chargeable financial service. If the legislature intended to exclude life insurance of

VAT in the First Schedule to the VAT Act, it was unnecessary for the legislature to

amend the First Schedule by VAT (Amendment) Act, No. 13 of 2004 and exempt

VAT from the supply of life insurance in item (x) (i) of Part II(b) of the First

Schedule to the VAT Act.

[100] A perusal of item (x) of Part II(b) of the First Schedule reveals that the

legislature deliberately reproduced all items from item (a) to (h) of item (x) of Part

II(b) of the First Schedule in section 25F of the VAT Act as transactions of financial

services, but deliberately omitted life insurance, Agrahara Insurance and crop

and livestock insurance in section 25F of the VAT Act as financial services. On

the other hand, if the legislature in introducing VAT on financial services intended

to subject life insurance transaction to VAT on financial services, it could have

39 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

easily defined life insurance as a financial service in section 25F of the VAT Act.

It is relevant to note that section 25F of the VAT Act exhaustively defines supply

of financial services. It states For the purposes of this Chapter (Chapter IIIA)

which relates to VAT on financial services supply of financial services means and

defines an exhaustive list of financial services. However, the life insurance,

Agrahara Insurance and crop and livestock insurance were deliberately

omitted from section 25F as financial services chargeable with VAT.

[101] In regard to the interpretation of the word means, it is apposite to refer to

P.M.Bakshi on Interpretation of Statutes, First Edition, , Reprint 2011, which at p.

242 states:

Generally, when the definition of a word begins with means it is indicative of the fact that the meaning of the word has been restricted: that is to say, it would not mean anything else but what has been indicated in the definition elseTherefore, unless there is any vagueness or ambiguity, no occasion will arise to interpret the term in a manner which may add something to the meaning of the word, which ordinarily does not mean by the definition itself, more particularly, where it is a restrictive definition (see-further Feroze N. Detiwala v. P.M. Wadhwani (2003) 1 SCC 433).

[102] In the Indian case of Mutto v. T.K. Nandi, [1979] 2 SCR 409 (418), it was said: "The Court has to determine the intention as expressed by the words used. If the words of a statute are themselves precise and unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound those words in their ordinary and natural sense. The words themselves alone do in such a case best declare the intention of the lawgiver." As it was stated in another Indian case of Thompson v. Gould, [1910] A.C. 409 (420) "it is a wrong thing to read into an Act of Parliament words which are not there, and in the absence of clear necessity, it is a wrong thing to do so. The cardinal rule of construction of statute is to read statutes literally, that is, by giving to the words their ordinary, natural and grammatical meaning." [Jugalki- shore v. Ram Cotton Co. Ltd., [1955] 1 SCR 1369]. In Punjab Land Development and Reclamation Corporation Ltd v. Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Chandigarh (1990) 3 SCR 111), the Supreme Court of India stated:

The definition has used the word 'means'. When a statute says that a word or phrase shall "mean"--not merely that it shall "include"--certain things or acts, "the definition is a hard-and-fast definition, and no other meaning can be assigned to the expression than is put down in definition" (per Esher, M.R., Gough v. Gough, [1891] 2 QB 665). A definition is an explicit statement of the full connotation of a term.

40 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

[103] During the course of argument, Mr. Gunetilleke conceded that life insurance

is exempt from VAT and the same is stated in paragraphs 49 and 50 of the written

submissions filed on behalf of the Respondent on 21.02.2013 as follows:

49.However, life insurance which is subparagraph (h) (i) under item (xi) of Part I

schedule 1, is not listed in section 25F of the VAT Act.

50.Accordinglu, even after the enactment of Chapter III of the VAT Act, life

insurance remains exempt from VAT.

[104] In my view, insurance business other than the following is liable to VAT:

1. Life insurance;

2. Agrahara Insurance; and

3. Crop and livestock insurance.

[105] I am also of the view that life insurance is not specifically enumerated in

section 25F of the VAT Act as a supply of financial services (see- section 25F). As

regards the question of law No. 3, Mr. Nihal Fernando submitted that the TAC has

failed to consider that in calculating the tax under section 25C(5)(c) of the VAT Act,

the profits arising from the business of life insurance are exempt supplies under

item (x) of paragraph (b) of Part II of the First Schedule, and thus, they shall be

regarded as zero rated under section 25 (C(5). Section 25C (5) provides:

(5) For the purpose of calculating the tax, the value addition attributable to-

a. except supplies, other than the exempt supplies under item (x) of

paragraph (b) of Part II of the First Schedue but taxable under this Chapter; b. zero rated supplies; c. taxable supplies on which tax has been paid or is payable in terms of this

Act, other than the value addition in relation to supplies taxable under

Chapter;

included in the profits calculated as specified in subsection (1) of this

section shall be treated as zero rated.

[106] As noted, the business of life insurance, Agrahara insurance and crop and

livestock insurance is exempted from VAT within the meaning of item (x) of

paragraph (h) of Part II of the Firrt Schedule to the VAT Act. It is not a supply of

financial service within the meaning of section 25Fof the VAT Act.

41 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

Whether investments in securities and other financial instruments fall within

the phrase loan, advance or credit in section 25F(g) of the VAT Act

[107] Mr. Gunetilleke however, submitted that while life insurance is excluded from

VAT, the VAT on financial services is calculated having separated the premium

income received from the Appellants life insurance business which is VAT exempt.

He submitted that the activities in question relate to investment income of the

Appellant, which fall within loans, advance or credit in section 25F, which is

chargeable with VAT. He argued that the activities set out in subparagraphs (a)-(g)

of section 25F are taxable as financial services, notwithstanding the fact that life

insurance is not listed in section 25F of the VAT Act. It was the contention of Mr.

Gunetilleke that certain activities of the Appellants business, namely, the

activities in subparagraph 25F(g)-the provision of any loan , advance and credit

falls within the definition of financial services in terms of section 25F of the VAT

Act. He submitted that none of the fifteen activities identified by the assessor is

life or general insurance business, but are investment income falling within loan,

advance and credit in section 25F(g) of the VAT Act.

[108] He strongly relied on the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance, No. 7

of 1937 (as amended) and submitted that when the Government issued

securities, it is raising a loan and thus, any person who purchases such securities

issued by the Government is providing a loan to the Government. His submission

was that, in addition to investment of life insurance business in government

securities, the Appellant was also involved in the provision of interest bearing loan,

advance and credit using other investments which are also liable to VAT on

financial services. Mr. Gunetilleke, thus submitted that, therefore, the Appellant is

liable for VAT on financial services under Chapter IIIA of the VAT Act.

Provision of Loan, advance or credit

[109] It is not in dispute that the provision of loan, advance or credit constitutes

financial services as defined in section 25F of the VAT Act. The provision of any

loan, advance or credit is wide enough to encompass activities such as- (a) loan

facilities (that include the granting of credit or secured or unsecured credit

facilities, the receipt of fees received in respect of such services, charges for

making arrangement for the granting of credit; (b) provision of credit facilities that

include purchase or repurchase arrangements and credit of the investments in

stocks, investments or business purposes.

42 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

[110] It is not in dispute that Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments issued

under the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance No. 8 of 1923 (as amended) and Treasury

Bonds which are medium to long term debt instruments issued under the

Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance, No. 7 of 1937 (as amended). It is not in

dispute that Treasury Bonds and Treasury Bills are government debt

securities issued by the Government of Sri Lanka and they earn periodic interest

until maturity. Mr. Gunetilleke submitted that none of the above mentioned

activities are part of the life insurance or general insurance business of the

Appellant, but they form part of the separate investment income of the Appellant

that fall within loans, advance or credit in section 25F (g) of the VAT Act. He,

apparently, sought to restrict the life insurance to the pure premium income

received from the policy holders and treat the interest component of life insurance

received from the investment of premium income as a separate investment

business for the purpose of imposing VAT on financial services.

[111] Mr. Nihal Fernando however, submitted that the insurance business is a

highly regulated business and the life insurance business consists of a number of

activities. He submitted that the lise insurance includes: (a) the acceptance of a

premium; (b) creating a life insurance fund and making investments using the said

fund in accordance with applicable regulations; (c) meeting the management

expenses; (d) payment of bonuses and ultimately paying the policy holders upon

maturity and/or occurrence of a covered incident. He further submitted that in life

insurance business, when the premium is received, it is accounted for as a liability

and not an income and the said premium goes into a life insurance fund which has

to be returned to the policy holder upon maturity of the policy with bonuses or on

the occurrence of an event covered by the policy. His contention was that the life

insurance business is not merely to accept a premium and to return after the

policy maturity or on the occurrence of an insured incident as it is a highly

regulated business. His contention was that a premium which is received by the

Appellant in life insurance is not consumed during the year like in the case of

general insurance but becomes accumulated in a fund.

[112] The determination of this aspect of the case is limited to the question

whether the interest income received by the Appellant is tied to the life insurance

fund with an investment element, or it was received from a separate investment

business, which is unrelated to the policy holders monies included in the life

insurance fund. In this context, it is necessary to look at the nature of the life

insurance contract and its investment portfolios in carrying on the insurance

43 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

business. Though the supply of services relating to life insurance contracts by the

insurers is exempt from the liability of VAT, there is no definition in the VAT Act as

to what activities of business that constitute the business of life insurance and the

business of insurance other than life insurance business (S.Balaratnnam, VALUE

ADDED TAX IN SRI LANKA, p. 605).

What is Insurance Business?

[113] I desire to first consider the meaning of life insurance business and the

regulation of the life insurance business as set out in the Regulation of Insurance

Industry Act, No. 43 of 2000 as amended by the Regulation of Insurance Industry

(Amendment) Act, No. 27 of 2007 & Act, No. 03 OF 2011. The classes of insurance

business are defined in section 114(1) of the said Act. The classification begins with

the broad division between long term business (i.e. life insurance and certain

related classes to which the Act applies), and general business (i.e. the classes

which are described as non-life to which the Act applies). Section 114 of the

Regulation of Insurance Industry Act (as amended) defines the phrase insurance

business broadly and provides the following definition of both life insurance and

general insurance business:

114(1) insurance business means

(a) long term insurance business, that is to say, the business of entering into or

maintaining contracts of assurance on human lives, such contracts including contracts whereby the payment of money is assured on death or on the happening of any contingency dependent on human life, and contracts which are subject to payment of premia for a term dependent on human life, and such contracts being deemed to comprise and include the following sub-classes :-

(i) life insurance contracts of insurance dependent on human life ; (ii) linked long term where benefits are wholly or partially determined by reference to an index or to the value of or to the income from assets of any description ; (iii) annuities contracts for the grant of annuities dependent on human life ; (iv) contracts for the granting of disability and multiple indemnity, accident and sickness benefits if so specified in such contracts, but excluding insurance business which is principally or wholly of any kind included in sub paragraph (i), (ii), (iii), (v) and (vi) ; (v) permanent health contracts of insurance providing specified benefits on incapacity from accident or sickness which are both in effect for a period of more than five years and cannot be cancelled by the insurer ;

44 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

(vi) capital redemption contracts ; and (vii) pension policies insurance contracts to provide pre and post retirement benefits for individuals.

(b) General Insurance Business which means all insurance business which do not fall within the definition of long term business being deemed to comprise and include the following sub classes :-

(i)marine, aviation or transit insurance policy means a policy of insurance

(ii) fire insurance business, that is to say, the business of effecting, otherwise than incidentally to some other class of insurance business, contracts of insurance against loss by, or incidental to, fire or other occurrence customarily included among the risks insured against in fire insurance policies;

(iii)motor vehicle insurance business, that is to say, the business of effecting contracts of insurance against loss of motor vehicles or damage arising out of or in connection with the use of motor vehicles, including third-party risks;

(iv)employers liability insurance business, that is to say, the issue of, or the undertaking of liability under policies insuring employers against liability to pay compensation or damages to workmen in their employment;

(v)miscellaneous insurance business, including personal accident insurance, fidelity guarantee insurance, burglary insurance, cash in transit insurance, cash in safe insurance, contractors all-risk insurance, erection all-risk insurance, electronic/computer insurance, boiler insurance and machinery breakdown insurance but excluding insurance business which is principally or wholly of any kind or kinds included in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) and those classes which would fall within the definition of long term business involving contracts of a long-term nature.

[114] An insurance contract is one whereby one party (the insurer) promises in

return for a money consideration (the premium) to pay to the other party (the

assured) a sum of money or to provide him with a corresponding benefit upon the

occurrence of one or more specified events (MaCGILIVRAY ON INSURANCE LAW,

12th Ed. P. 3). The characteristics of a contract of insurance are (i) premium; (ii)

promise to pay; (iii) sum of money or corresponding benefit, which includes the

provision of services to be paid for by the insurer for the benefit of the assured;

and (iv) upon a special event involving uncertainty (Supra- pp 4-5). The essentials

of an insurance transaction were explained in the CJEU Proceedings brought by

Frskringsaktiebolaget Skandia (publ) (No 2) (C-240/99) EU:C:2001:140; [2001] 1

WLR 1617; [2001] ECR I-1951 paragraph 17 as follows:

45 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

"the essentials of an insurance transaction are, as generally understood, that the insurer undertakes, in return for prior payment of a premium, to provide the insured, in the event of materialisation of the risk covered, with the service agreed when the contract was concluded. (Proceedings brought by Frskringsaktiebolaget Skandia (publ) (No 2) (C-240/99) EU:C:2001:140; [2001] 1 WLR 1617; [2001] ECR I-1951 paragraph 17).

[115] In the case of Prudential Insurance Co v IRC [1904] 2 KB 658, Channell J. at

paragraph 44 identified the key features of an insurance contract as (Prudential

test):

1. a contract whereby, for some consideration, the insured secures some benefit,

usually but not necessarily, the payment of money, upon the happening of

some event. It must be a contract for the payment of a sum of money or for

some corresponding benefit;

2. the event must involve some amount of uncertainty, either that the event

will ever happen or at the time at which it will happen;

3. the event must be adverse to the interest of the insured, such that the

payment meets some loss or other detriment on the happening of the event

i.e. there must be an insurable interest in the subject matter (otherwise the

contract is one of wager);

4. in the case of life insurance, the interest is not the measure of loss.

What is life insurance?

[116] Life insurance is a contract whereby the insured agrees to pay certain sums,

called premiums, at specified times, and in consideration thereof the insurer

agrees to pay certain sums of money upon the death of the injured on certain

conditions and in specified ways (Life Insurance Corporation of India v. Vishwanath

Verma and Ors. (30.09.1994 - SC) : Civil Appeal No. 6493 of 1994, Decided on:

30.09.1994). In terms of section 114(1) of the Regulation of Insurance Act of 2004,

'Life Insurance' is confined to contracts of insurance dependent on human

life and thus, the exemption of the life insurance applies to the insurer, being the

person authorized to carry on such life insurance business (S.Balaratnnam, VALUE

ADDED TAX IN SRI LANKA, p. 606). Life insurance contracts are relatively long-

term compared to non-life insurance policies, which are usually for a short period

of time. Life insurance involves one event death, the risk of which for any

individual is often based on a standard mortality table. In fact, to a large degree

much life insurance is investment, and it remains, from a market point of view at

46 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

least, an investment (Malcolm A. Clarke, The Law of Insurance Contracts, 5th Ed. P

16). What distinguishes it from other kinds of investment is that the gain or yield,

depends on the contingencies of human life (Supra). Any activity which involves

the investment of the customers premiums, carry an element of risk for the insurer

of the life insurance product or which can properly be seen as an insurance risk

(Supra). Such an operation might be regarded as an activity which is related to the

maintenance and preservation of life insurance fund and payment to the

customers by way of bonuses and other corresponding benefits to the insurer.

[117] The insurer to carry on business requires authorization under the Regulation

of Insurance Industry Act, No. 43 of 2000, and therefore, it is only the insurer

effecting life insurance, who is exempt under the provisions in the VAT Act (S.

Balaratnnam, VALUE ADDED TAX IN SRI LANKA, p. 606). Now the question is

whether the regulatory framework provided in the Regulation of Insurance

Industry Act, No. 43 of 2000 prevents the Appellant from carrying on the business

of financial services defined in section 25A(1)(ii) of the VAT Act.

Regulatory Framework and Insurance Fund

[118] I desire now to examine the Appellants argument vied the regulatory regime

established by the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act does not permit the life

insurance company to engage in finance business, and therefore, the Appellants

life insurance business is distinct from the business of carrying on the supply of

finance services. Mr. Nihal Fernando strongly relied on the provisions of the

Regulation of Insurance Industry Act, No. 43 of 2000 and argued that the

insurance business is a separate and distinct business which prohibits a life

insurance company to engage in the finance business unless approval is obtained

from the Insurance Board. He further submitted that there is no material

whatsoever, that the Appellant was involved in other business activities and

therefore, the entire interest income of the Appellant should be treated as having

received from the life insurance business.

[119] Section 12 of the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act provides that no

person shall carry on insurance business in Sri Lanka unless such person has

registered under the Act and that no registered person shall carry on any form of

business other than insurance business unless such person is permitted to carry on

financial services business. Section 12 provides:

47 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

12. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, from and after the appointed date, no person shall carry on insurance business in Sri Lanka unless such person is for the time being registered or deemed to be registered under this Act to carry on such business .

(2) A registration under subsection (1) may be for general insurance business or for long term insurance business .

(4) A person registered under subsection (1) shall not carry on any form of business other than insurance business:

Provided that, a person may, with the prior written approval of the Board, carry on any financial services business which is ancillary or associated with the insurance business for which a registration is obtained under this Act.

The insurance fund & compulsory investment in Government Securities

[120] The Appellants argument also relies on section 25 of the Regulation of

Insurance Industry Act which provides for the establishment by an insurer of

separate insurance fund for each class of its insurance business, which stipulates

what must be paid into an insurance fund and the restrictions on what an

insurance fund may be used for. It is common ground that the Appellant was

statutorily required to invest 20% of its assets from general insurance business and

30% of the assets from its life insurance business in terms of the Regulation of

Insurance Industry Act. Sub-section (1) and (2) of section 25 of the Act reads as

follows:

25(1) Not less than twenty per centum of the assets of the technical reserve being maintained for a general insurance business under section 24 and not less than thirty per centum of the assets for the long term insurance fund being maintained under subsection (1) of section 38, shall be in the form of Government Securities. The balance assets shall be in the form of such other investments as shall be determined by the Board.

25(2). The Board shall have the power, where it considers any investment of any assets in any reserve or fund referred to in subsection (1) of this section is unsuitable, to issue directions for the disposal of such investment within such time as may be specified in such directions.

[121] It is crystal clear that only 20% of the general insurance and 30% of life

insurance assets shall be invested in the form of government securities. The

balance assets however shall be in the form of such other investments as shall be

48 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

determined by the Board. Mr. Fernando further relied on section 27 which provides

that the insurer shall separate its insurance business and maintain separate

accounts in respect of each classs of insurance business. Section 27 provides:

27. Where an insurer carries on business of one or more classes of insurance business, such insurer shall keep separate accounts of all receipts and payments in respect of each class of insurance business and also maintain separate accounts in respect of each sub-class of general insurance business it is carrying on.

Solvency margin.

[122] Section 26 prescribed by the Act is another regulatory measure to ensure

that the interests of policy holders are adequately protected. It reads:

26. (1) Every insurer shall maintain in respect of each class of insurance business, a solvency margin of such amount as may be determined by the Board in respect of that class of insurance business, by rules made in that behalf. (2) Rules may be made by the Board to provide for the determination of the value of the assets and their admissibility and the amount of the liabilities for the purpose of determining the solvency margin to be maintained in respect of the class of insurance business being carried on by any such insurer. (3) For the purpose of ensuring the avoidance of mismatching of assets as against liabilities by insurers, the Board may, from time to time by rules made in that behalf, lay down criteria to be made applicable in determining the minimum limits of their assets as against their liabilities.

[123] Mr. Fernandos submission was that in view of the regulatory framework set

out in the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act, the Appellants interest income

shall be treated as having received from all activities set out in the asessors letter

which would invariably be integral part of the life insurance business included in

the life insurance fund. The reserve fund or the life insurance fund is merely part of

the regulatory framework for insurance companies, but they cannot be

determinative of its tax treatment of an insurance company. The imposition of the

tax is solely within the purview of Parliament through the enactment of tax

legislations, which must be interpreted by the Courts or relevant tribunals using

principles developed by case law (Comptroller of Income Tax v. BBO (2014) SGCA)

10, paragraphs 44-45). In this case, Andrew Ang J. stated at pp 45-36:

The insurance fund is merely part of the regulatory framework for insurance companies and cannot be determinative of their tax treatment. The imposition of tax is solely within the purview of Parliament through the enactment of clear tax legislation which is to be interpreted by the court or relevant tribunal using

49 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

principles developed incrementally by case law. The fact that certain gains are attributable to investments held in statutorily mandated insurance funds cannot automatically divest the relevant tribunal of its proper role in deciding whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the gains are properly attributable to the revenue or capital account. Otherwise, any regulatory body would theoretically be able to determine the taxation of companies. This runs counter to the fact that regulatory frameworks are often shaped by intricate policy considerations which may have little or nothing to do with tax.

Moreover, the distinction between the insurance fund and the shareholders fund, whilst relevant, cannot be determinative of the tax treatment of particular assets or investments. Clearly, gains arising from the shareholders fund could be taxed as income as well. In our judgment, insurance companies (whether holding assets in the insurance fund or shareholders fund) should only be taxed according to the ordinary principles of revenue law, albeit the holding of an asset in a particular fund may be a relevant factor in ascertaining whether the investment was intended to be held as a capital asset.

[124] In my view, the purpose of the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act is for the

regulation of the insurance business for the protection of policy holders deposits

in investments and the prohibition of insurance companies from engaging in

financial services without authorization. The VAT liability of an insurance company

is solely determined by the provisions of the Constitution through the VAT Act

which is interpreted by the Courts and relevant tribunals. Now the question is to

consider the relationship between the insurance business and the investment

income derived from the policyholders premium income in the life insurance fund

and the relevant VAT liability arising therefrom. It is necessary to consider whether

the investment activities carried out by the Appellant were required to earn

income for the purpose of carrying on its insurance business and if so, whether the

activities carried out by the insurance must be held to be a part of the life

insurance business

The role of investment income in the life insurance business- the Investment

is part of the life insurance

[125] The crucial question is whether the interest income was a mere enhancement

of value of the premium income of the life insurance fund from investment by

realizing a securities and other financial instruments. If not, the question is whether

it was made in the course of carrying on the business of supplying of the financial

services for sole profit-making defined in section 25F(g). In determining the scope

of VAT, it is therefore necessary to draw a distinction between the life insurance

50 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

business with an investment element, and investment business. Usually, insurance

companies generate income from charging premiums in exchange for insurance

coverage, and then invest them in other income-generating assets. There are two

significant elements arising from the life insurance transaction, and the utlitimate

beneficial interest to the end customer. The first is the "insurance transactions

proper and the second is the "operations arising directly therefrom involving the

element of investment. The insurance law allows insurance companies to carry out

"not only insurance transactions proper but also "operations arising directly

therefrom by investing the policy holders monies in securities and other similar

instruments for the purpose of earning an income.

[126] The Argument of Mr. Gunetilleke that the exemption of life insurance is

limited to the minimum amount of pure insurance premium or the amount of

cash surrender value in a "life insurance" contract does not exist in the modern

investment oriented insurance business, which involves a combination of insurance

premium component and investment component. It is to be noted that the

obligation undertaken by the insurer under a contract of life insurance is not

limited to the payment of monies to the policy holders upon maturity and/or on

theoccurrence of a covered event, as formerly thought, but it also extended to

corresponding benefits or services offered to the insured by competitive life

insurance companies such as bonuses, loans and other promotional benefits etc.

[127] Life insurance products generally perform the dual functions of the collection

of premiums and depositing them in life insurance fund and investing them in an

interest bearing financial assets. The investment of policy holders monies in

financial assets generates an additional interest income to the life insurance fund

while the company waits for possible payouts. The life insurance is highly

investment oriented business involving the insurance and investment component

and the amounts invested from the insurance fund are tied to and payable to the

policy holders, in addition to corresponding benefits in terms of the insurance

contract. In Calcutta Insurance Ltd. v. Commr. of Income Tax AIR 1953 Cal, the

Calcutta High court stated:

22. A life insurance company must be prepared to pay claims under the policies issued by it, as and when they mature, and for that purpose must provide itself with sufficient funds. The premia received can never be sufficient and, therefore, the funds require to be augmented by investments which will bring in interest or dividends or may result in profit, if disposed of. The investments may appreciate or depreciate or may become unrealisable wholly or in part or their realisation may result in gain or loss.

51 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

[128] A life insurance company can however, hold many other assets including the

shareholders fund which are unrelated to the life insurance contract, and the

income derived from investing other assets in financial assets can only be

categorized as income from investment business, which is not related to life

insurance contract between the insurer and the policy holder. No doubt, an life

insurance company makes profits or losses from investing monies in its life

insurance fund, but it is an incident of an insurance business to receive premium in

advance, and such invest them in financial assets to generate more income. The

dividing line is whether the investment of premium income is merely an

enhancement of the value of the premium income by investment, or was it done

while carrying on the business of supplying of financial services defined in section

25F (g).

[129] The appropriate approach in such situations was considered in relation to

income tax, by the Lord Justice Clerk in the seminal case of Californian Copper

Syndicate (Limited and Reduced) v Harris (Surveyor of Taxes) (1904) 5 TC 159

(Californian Copper Syndicate) at 165 to 166:

It is quite a well settled principle in dealing with questions of assessment of Income Tax, that where the owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realise it, and obtains a greater price for it than he originally acquired it at, the enhanced price is not profit assessable to Income Tax. But it is equally well established that enhanced values obtained from realisation or conversion of securities may be so assessable, where what is done is not merely a realisation or change of investment, but an act done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a business. The simplest case is that of a person or association of persons buying and selling lands or securities speculatively, in order to make gain, dealing in such investments as a business, and thereby seeking to make profits. There are many companies which in their very inception are formed for such a purpose, and in these cases it is not doubtful that, where they make a gain by a realisation, the gain they make is liable to be assessed for Income Tax.

[130] The Lord Justice Clerk then went on to articulate the time-honoured test to

be applied in such cases (at 166):

What is the line which separates the two classes of cases may be difficult to define, and each case must be considered according to its facts; the question to be determined beingIs the sum of gain that has been made a mere enhancement of value by realising a security, or is it a gain made in an

52 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

operation of business in carrying out a scheme for profit-making?[Emphasis added).

[131] The relevant question to be asked in such cases is simple, viz, whether the

gain in question is a mere enhancement of value by realising a security or

whether it was made in an operation of business in carrying out a scheme for

profit-making. Lord Justice Clerk further stated that:

.it is not enough that the gain arose in the operation of business; it must also have arisen pursuant to the carrying out of a scheme for profit-making. Put another way, the distinction is between the profit that arises when property has been committed to a business as part of its stock in trade and is then realised in the course of trading operations and the gain that arises from a realisation of property not so committed. The former is taxable income, the latter not.

[132] In respect of the taxation consequences of gains by banks and insurance,

New Zealand Court of Appeal in the recent decision on taxation of receipts by

both banking and insurance businesses, in CIR v National Insurance Company of

New Zealand Ltd: (1999) 19 NZTC 15,135 stated:

The principle expressed in the Californian Copper Syndicate case has been applied time and time again in considering the taxability of gains on the realisation of investments by banks and insurance companies. The nature of banking and insurance requires businesses in those fields to invest a substantial part of their funds in readily realisable investments in order to meet, in the case of banks, the demands of their customers and, in the case of insurers, the claims of policy holders. The realisation of such assets is a normal step in carrying on the banking (or insurance) business or in other words it is an act done in what is truly the carrying on of the business. [Ibid 15,138].

[133] Though the Californian Copper principle has been applied, in respect of the

taxation consequences of gains by banks and insurance, its applicability depends

on the different business activities of banking and insurance. The VAT

consequences for trading banks which were different from the taxation treatment

for life insurance company, which is obliged to invest in securities for the purpose

of enhancing its insurance premiums collected from policyholders for the

protection of the life insurance fund. It is relevant to note that the life insurance

fund shall be the security of the policy-holders as though it belonged to an insurer

carrying on no other business than the life insurance business. Accordingly, the

interests of policy holders will not be affected from any other contracts of the

insurer (e.g. investment business carried out without using the premium income of

the policy holders) which does not involve any relationship between the premium

53 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

income of the policy holders and the interest income derived from investing of

premium income deposited in the life insurance fund.

[134] A thorough factual inquiry is warranted when considering the taxation

implications of gains made by an insurance business with an investment element

as opposed to a separate investment business using assets unrelated to life

insurance fund. Now the question is whether the interest income from investment

in securities was derived from the trading operations of an insurance business in

the course of carrying on the business of supplying financial services or it was

derived in the course of enhancing the life insurance fund to earn income which is

part of the life insurance business.

[135] In terms of section 25 of the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act, No. 43 of

2000, the Appellant as a registered insurer is statutorily obliged to invest 20% of its

reserve funds from general insurance business and 30% of the assets from the life

insurance business to invest in government securities. In this context of the

insurance industry, it is trite that an integral part of the insurance business is to

channel its premium receipts into productive activities such as investments in

equities, securities and properties which would generate investment income to

meet its liabilities arising from claims by policy holders (see- the judgment of the

Singapore Court of Appeal in Comptroller of Income Tax v. BBO (2014) SGCA) 10,

paragraph 20).

[136] A more detailed examination of the nature of the insurance business and its

general consequential treatment for taxation purposes is found in the judgment of

Hamilton J in The Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company v Bennett

(Surveyor of Taxes) (1913) 6 TC 327, where Lord Mersey (at 379 and 380) stated;

It is well known that in the course of carrying on an insurance business large sums of money derived from premiums collected and from other sources accumulate in the hands of the insurers, and that one of the most important parts of the profits of the business is derived from the temporary investment of these moneys. These temporary investments are also required for the formation of the reserve fund, a fund created to attract customers and to serve as a standby in the event of sudden claims being made upon the insurers in respect of losses. It is, according to my view, impossible to say that such investments do not form part of this Companys insurance business, or that the returns flowing from them do not form part of its profits. In a commercial sense the directors of the Company owe a duty to their shareholders and to their customers to make such investments, and to receive and distribute in the ordinary course of business, whether in the form of

54 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

dividends, or in payment of losses, or in the formation of reserves, the moneys collected from them.

[137] The High Court of Australia in Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited

v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1946) 73 CLR 604 (Colonial Mutual Life

Assurance) took similar views at 619620:

But an insurance company, whether a mutual insurance company or not, is undoubtedly carrying on an insurance business and the investment of its funds is as much a part of that business as the collection of the premiums. The purpose of investing the funds of the appellant is to obtain the most effective yield of income. The diminution or increase in the capital value of the investment between the date of purchase and that of maturity, and the apportionment and deduction or addition over the intervening period of that diminution from or increase to the interest actually payable on the investment is a material ingredient in the ascertainment of this yield. In Konstam, Law of Income Tax, 8th ed. (1940), p. 126, it is stated that the buying and selling of investments is a necessity of insurance business; and where an insurance company in the course of its trade realizes an investment at a larger price than what was paid for it, the difference is to be reckoned among its profits; conversely, any loss is to be deducted. [Emphasis added].

[138] In Marac Life Assurance Ltd. v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue [1986] 1

N.Z.L.R. 694 the Court of Appeal in New Zealand considered the relationship

between the life insurance and investment, and Cooke J. said, at pp. 697-698:

"In the general sense all life insurance is investment. What distinguishes it from other kinds of investment is that the gain or yield, if there is one, depends on the contingencies of human life. That is the case as regards all these bonds. Under each a fixed sum, being more than the premium, becomes payable to the policyholder or his personal representative (the 10-year bond carrying as well participation in surplus), but the date on which that fixed sum becomes payable depends on whether or not the life assured is continuing. It is true that the sum is calculated by adding to the premium a given percentage, and compounding the resulting figure if necessary; but only if death happens to occur on an exact anniversary of the commencement of the risk will the sum correspond to interest for the actual use of money. No reason is apparent for describing these contracts as anything other than life insurance. In essence they are very closely linked with the contingencies of human life. A contract of life insurance is not the less such because it is for a short term." (see- further paragraph 187 of Fuji Finance Inc v Aetna Life Ins Co Ltd [1997] Ch 173) [Emphasis added].

55 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

[139] The Court of Appeal in Fuji Finance Inc v Aetna Life Ins Co Ltd (Supra)

further recognised that the investment element of a life insurance policy, which

has become such a feature of modern insurance, is consistent with its

characterisation as a life policy (page 187). These cases sought to identify the

distinction between insurance business and investment business, and decide

whether a contract is an investment contract or a life insurance contract with an

investment element, or whether the earning of profits was done in thr course of

the business of supplying of financial services (e.g. in the nature of trade or

business). I am of the view that while the interest income received from the

investment of the life insurance fund is a normal part of the business of a life

insurance company, the carrying on the business of supplying financial services in

the form of trade or business, as the predominant intention of the business, is not

part of life insurance company. The insurance company that carries on life

insurance business and invests the life insurance monies to enhance its income is

as much a part of that business as the collection of the premiums. The purpose of

investing the funds of the Appellant is thus to obtain the most effective yield of

income.

Distinction between carrying on the business of supplying financial services and earning of income by investment

[140] Mr. Gunetilleke however, argued that the investment activities are ancillary or

associated with the insurance business, and all such activities that are classified as

financial services under section 25F(g) shall be considered as an integral part of

the business income of the Appellant subject to VAT in financial services. On the

other hand, Mr. Fernandos argument was that the mere fact that the investment

income received by the Appellant is treated as business income does not mean

that the Appellant is engaged in the business of supplying financial services. In

this context, it is necessary to consider the distinction between the carrying on the

business of supplying financial services and the earning of income for the mere

enhancement of the value of the life insurance fund.

[141] The distinction between carrying on a business and earning income from

investment in property was considered in the Indian case of Saifuddin Alimohamed

v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay City AIR1954 Bom 219 in the context of

the income tax law. Dealing with Section 10 (1), Income Tax Act, Chagla, C. J.,

observed:

"Therefore, looking to the plain language used by the Legislature, what has been emphasised in this section is the fact of a business being carried on by the

56 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

assessee. It is the assessee who carries on a business who is liable to pay tax under the head of business. It is rather significant to notice the difference in language in Section 10, and Section 9. Section 9 deals with tax under the head of property and that tax is payable by an assessee who is the owner of the property. So, in the case of property, what is emphasised by the Legislature is ownership. In the case of business, what is emphasised is not the ownership of the business, but the fact of the business being carried on by the assessee [emphasis added].

[142] The concept of business referred to in section 25A (1) of the VAT Act, must,

however, constitute a continuing activity which is predominantly concerned with

the business of an specified institution or a person carrying on the business of

supplying of any financial services to others for a consideration over a period of

time (see-The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children v. Customs

and Excise Commissioners (1992) VATIR 417, 422). This means that a supply of

financial services defined in section 25F(g), is not taxable unless the insurance

company is carrying on the business of supplying of such financial services such

as a trading bank or a finance company or any unregistered person providing

services similar to financial services provided by a finance company. The question

is whether the interest income in question could be characterised as investment

income derived from investment business rather than insurance business with an

investment element depends on the nature of the business activities of an

insurance company.

[143] Now the question is whether the interest income from investment in

securities and other instruments was derived from the trading operations of the

insurance business in the course of carrying on the business of supplying financial

services or it was derived in the course of enhancing the life insurance fund to earn

income which is part of the life insurance business. The assessor has calculated

VAT on financial services on the basis of the information provided by the

Appellant in the audited statement of accounts with its returns. The assessor has

clearly identified that the interest income was received from the activities

connected to the life insurance section of the audited statement of accounts (see-

page 85 of the TAC brief). At paragraph 64 of the written submissions filed on

behalf of the Respondent, the Respondent without any proof states that The

Appellant does not maintain separate books to demonstrate that its investments

for life insurance are isolated from all other investment income...

[144] No observation has been made by the assessor in his letter date 25.06.2014

(pp. 9-14 of the TAC brief) that the Appellant has failed to maintain separate

57 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

accounts or that the interest income was derived either from the general insurance

business or from other investment business other than life insurance business of

the Appellant. A perusal of the audited accounts (pp. 116-122 of the TAC brief)

reveals that the Appellant has clearly separated its life and general insurance

business and maintained separate accounts for each class of business(Vide- pp.

117a and 117 of the TAC brief). In my view, the life insurance contract with the

involvement of an investment element for the purpose of enhancement of value of

the premium income cannot be splited into two separate contracts or separate

parts and the amounts invested out of the life insurance fund are tied to the

payment of the policy holders monies in terms of the contract of insurance. In the

absence of any finding by the assessor to that effect in his letter, I am of the view

that the amounts invested out of the life insurance fund are tied to premium

income of the policy holders and they shall be treated as part and parcel of the life

insurance, which is exempted from VAT in terms of item (x) (i) of Part (b) of the

First Schedule to the Vat Act.

[145] The Appellant has earned interest income from investing the life insurance

fund of the policyholders in government securities and other instruments and

received interest income from payments made to policy holders, granting loans to

staff and other credit and equity transactions for the purpose of mere

enhancement of the value of the premium income received from policy holders.

The investment of the life insurance fund is a part of the life insurance business as

the collection of the premiums. The purpose of the investment in government

securities and other similar securities by a life insurance company, using the life

insurance fund is not to grant loans and other credit facilities defined in section

25F(g), and trade in them similar to a finance company and a trading bank or an

unregistered person providing services similar to services provided by a finance

company. The purpose or the intention of investing the life insurance funds of the

Appellant is to ensure security for the policy holders life insurance fund or to

obtain the most effective yield of income or to enhance the value of the life

insurance fund.

[146] No evidence has been placed before Court that the Appellant was either

permitted to engage in a finance business as a registered finance company or the

Appellant is a person who is carrying on the business of supplying financial

services similar to an unregistered finance company. No evidence has been placed

before Court that the Appellant is engaged in any financial business other than life

insurance business to be regarded as a company carrying on the business of

58 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

supplying of financial services for the purpose of the VAT treatment under section

25A(1) of the Chapter IIIA of the VAT Act.

[147] In my view the investment activities of the Appellant were an integral part

of the life insurance business with an investment element conducted by the

Appellant and the interest income from investments form part of the life

insurance business. The interest income was received for the purpose of mere

enhancement of the value of the premium income by realizing a security which

is not done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of the business

of supplying of financial services with a profitmaking purpose of a trading

company.

[148] The interest income received from investment of premium income in

securities and other similar instruments generated an income to the life

insurance fund which may ordinarily give rise to an inference that it was a

taxable business income for the purpose the income tax law, which is totally

different from the treatment of VAT on financial services under the VAT Act.

Even if the income from investment is treated as an income from life insurance

business within the meaning of the income tax law, for the purpose of VAT

liability, it must be proved that the Appellant supplied a financial service as

defined in section 25F, and that such financial service was done in the business

of supplying financiall services. In the present case, both requirements are not

satisfied.

[149] The TAC, in my view, has totally failed to consider that the life insurance is

not a financial service enumerated in section 25F so as to constitute a

chargeable financial service. The TAC has further failed to consider that the life

insurance business is exempted from VAT and therefore, any value addition is

exempted from VAT in terms of item (x) (i) of Part II(b) of the First Schedule to

the VAT Act. The TAC has failed to consider that the investment of the life

insurance policy holders monies in Treasury Bills and other similar instruments

is to ensure security for the policy holder and to enhance the value of the

policyholders fund and not as granting loans to the Government, policy

holders, staff or other financial instrument holders etc. The TAC has failed to

consider that no evidence has been placed before the assessor or the

Respondent or the TAC that the Appellant was carrying on the business of

supplying financial services defined in section 25A(1)(ii) read with section 25F of

the VAT Act or the interest income was received from such other investment

business not related to life insurance business.

59 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

[150] Mr. Gunetilleke however, heavily relied on the following paragraphs of the

decision of this Court in Peoples Leasing and Finance PLC v. The Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue CA/TAX/001/2016 decided on 20.07.2021, in support of

his contention that any person supplying financial services mentioned in section

25F where such value of supply exceeds the threshold limit as stated in section

25A(2) of the VAT Act, is liable for the purpose of VAT on financial services:

[155] The situation is different where the company has received income on a continuous basis from the transactions carried out in the course of the business of trading in securities (i.e., sale or purchase of shares in the share market, which goes beyond the activity of a simple acquisition or sale of shares). Such transactions would be a supply of services provided for consideration as part of continuous commercial activities of such company.

[169] The issue is whether underwriting, sub-underwriting or subscribing of any equity security, debt security or participatory security is deemed to be a supply of financial services for the VAT purposes. A dividend, being a return for subscribing and contributing to any equity share capital, pursuant to an offer for subscription and purchasing of shares in the course of carrying on business of financial business, by financial companies, can be classified as a supply of financial services.

[171].. If the Appellant being the holding company goes beyond the mere acquisition and holding of shares and becomes actively involved in carrying on financial business of trading in securities for generating income, the dividend payment regularly received as a consideration in the trading of shares may constitute a supply of financial service.

[151] It is relevant to note that the facts of case in Peoples Leasing and Finance

PLC v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra) are totally different

from the facts of the present case. The Peoples Leasing and Fiannce PLC was

admittedly a finance company registered with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, and

thus, it was regarded as a specified institution within the meaning of Section 25F

of the VAT Act. It was clearly a Leasing and Finance PLC carrying on the business

of supplying financial services identified in that case. Accordingly, the VAT

liability of Peoples Leasing and Finance PLC was decided completely on different

factual and VAT law principles. As noted, the principles decided in the case of

Peoples Leasing and Finance PLC v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

(supra) will not apply to the Appellant who is only carrying on life insurance

business with an investment element, and investing the policyholders premium

60 CA - TAX 0029 - 2019 TAC/VAT/007/2015

income for the sole purpose of enhancing the value of premium income of the life

insurance fund.

[152] For those reasons, I hold that the TAC has erred in holding that the

Appellant has supplied financial services as defined in section 25F of the VAT

Act and that the Appellant is carrying on the business of supplying of financial

services in terms of section 25A(1) read with section 25F of the VAT Act.

Conclusion

[153] For those reasons, I am of the view that the question of law No. 1 should be

answered in favour of the Respondent and the questions of law Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

8 and 9 should be answered in favour of the Appellant. In the result, the questions

of law referred must, in my opinion, be answered as follows :

Question (1)- No

Question (2) -Yes

Question (3) -Yes

Question (4) -Yes

Question (5) -Yes:

Question (6) -Yes

Question (7) -Yes

Question (8) -Yes

Question (9) -Yes:

[154] For those reasons, the determination made by the Tax Appeals Commission

dated 28.06.2019 is annulled and the Registrar of this Court is directed to send a

copy of this judgment to the Tax Appeals Commssion.
