    "text": "733 at 746). No universal rule can be laid down for determining whether a provision is mandatory or directory. It is the duty of Courts of Justice to try to get at the intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the Statute to be construed per Lord Campbell in Liverpool Borough Bank vs Turner (1860) (2 De CF. & J 502 at 508) Vita Food Products vs. Unus Shipping Co. (1939 A.C. 377 at 393). Each Statute must be considered separately and in determining whether a particular provision of it is mandatory or directory one must have regard to the general scheme to the other sections of the Statute. The Queen vs. Justices of the County of London County Council (1893) 2 Q.B. 476 at 479). It is also stated that considerations of convenience and justice must be considered. Pope vs. Clarke (1953) (2 A.E.R. 704 at 705). Then again, it is said that to discover the intention of the Legislature it is necessary to consider-(1) The Law as it stood before the Statute was passed. (2) The mischief if any, under the old law which the Statute sought to remedy and (3) the remedy itself. (Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, Edition 12 page 160). These are all guidelines for determining whether Parliament intended that the failure to observe any provision of a Statute would render an act in question null and void. They are by no means easy of application and opinions are bound to differ. Indeed, some cases there may be where the dividing line between mandatory and directory is very thin. But the decision has to be made. I will therefore examine the Statute bearing in mind these guidelines.",

I am not sure that it is the most fortunate language that could have been adopted to express the idea that it is intended to convey; but still, that is the recognised language, and I propose to adhere to it. The real question in all these cases is this: A thing has been ordered by the legislature to be done. What is the consequence if it is not done? In the case of statutes that are said to be imperative, the Courts have decided that if it is not done the whole thing fails, and the proceedings that follow upon it are all void. On the other hand, when the Courts hold a provision to be mandatory or directory, they say that, although such provision may not have been complied with, the subsequent proceedings do not fail. Still, whatever the language, the idea is a perfectly distinct one. There may be many provisions in Acts of Parliament which, although they are not strictly obeyed, yet do not appear to the Court to be of that material importance to the subject-matter to which they refer, as that the legislature could have intended that the non-observance of them should be followed by a total failure of the whole proceedings. On the other hand, there are some provisions in respect of which the Court would take an opposite view, and would feel that they are matters which must be strictly obeyed, otherwise the whole proceedings that subsequently follow must come to an end.",

That provision is an injunction on the Commissioner to give his decision within the 3 months and not to keep parties in suspense. Both the employer and the employee should, without undue delay, know the fate of the application made by the employer. But the delay should not render null and void the proceedings and prejudicially affect the parties, as the parties have no control over the proceedings. It could not have been intended that the delay should cause a loss of the jurisdiction that the Commissioner had, to give an effective order of approval or refusal. In my view, a failure to comply literally with the aforesaid provision does not affect the efficacy or finality of the Commissioners order made thereunder. Had it been the intention of Parliament to avoid such orders, nothing would have been simpler than to have so stipulated.",

It is submitted that the definition of the word hearing as used in the second proviso to section 140 (10) must be interpreted having regard to the legislative intention of disposing of matters before the Board of Review speedily. It would be contrary to the legislative intention (and the Board of Review would be at liberty to make even twenty-five years before orally hearing an appeal) if the operation date for the commencement of the time bar was construed to be the date of the oral hearing....",

This of course is well within the time limit and I would go to the extent to state that the Board has been very conscious of early disposal of the appeal. Board cannot be faulted for getting the appeal fixed for hearing as stated above since it is the duty and function of the Secretary of the Board to fix a date and time for hearing and to notify the parties. If it was the intention of the legislature that hearing should be concluded within 2 years from the date of filing the petition or that the time period of 2 years begins to run from the date of filing the petition, there could not have been a difficulty to make express provision, in that regard. I do agree with the view of the State Counsel. Hearing no doubt commences from the date of oral hearing. I would as such answer this question in favour of the Respondent and endorse the view of the Board of Review. It is not time barred as the Board arrived at the determination within 2 years.

But it is equally well established that enhanced values obtained from realisation or conversion of securities may be so assessable, where what is done is not merely a realisation or change of investment, but an act done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a business. The simplest case is that of a person or association of persons buying and selling lands or securities speculatively, in order to make gain, dealing in such investments as a business, and thereby seeking to make profits. There are many companies which in their very inception are formed for such a purpose, and in these cases it is not doubtful that, where they make a gain by a realisation, the gain they make is liable to be assessed for Income Tax.",

The diminution or increase in the capital value of the investment between the date of purchase and that of maturity, and the apportionment and deduction or addition over the intervening period of that diminution from or increase to the interest actually payable on the investment is a material ingredient in the ascertainment of this yield. In Konstam, Law of Income Tax, 8th ed. (1940), p. 126, it is stated that the buying and selling of investments is a necessity of insurance business; and where an insurance company in the course of its trade realizes an investment at a larger price than what was paid for it, the difference is to be reckoned among its profits; conversely, any loss is to be deducted.

What distinguishes it from other kinds of investment is that the gain or yield, if there is one, depends on the contingencies of human life. That is the case as regards all these bonds. Under each a fixed sum, being more than the premium, becomes payable to the policyholder or his personal representative (the 10-year bond carrying as well participation in surplus), but the date on which that fixed sum becomes payable depends on whether or not the life assured is continuing. It is true that the sum is calculated by adding to the premium a given percentage, and compounding the resulting figure if necessary; but only if death happens to occur on an exact anniversary of the commencement of the risk will the sum correspond to interest for the actual use of money. No reason is apparent for describing these contracts as anything other than life insurance. In essence they are very closely linked with the contingencies of human life. A contract of life insurance is not the less such because it is for a short term.\" (see- further paragraph 187 of Fuji Finance Inc v Aetna Life Ins Co Ltd [1997] Ch 173) [Emphasis added].",
