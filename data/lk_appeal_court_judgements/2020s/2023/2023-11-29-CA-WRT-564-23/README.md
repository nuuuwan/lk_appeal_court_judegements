ORDER

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

On the complaint made by the 4th respondent to the Department of Labour

for non-payment of gratuity, the 2nd respondent has conducted an inquiry.

In the inquiry, the petitioner company took up the position that due to the

fraudulent actions and financial losses caused by the 4th respondent, the

gratuity that had to be paid to the 4th respondent was deemed to be

forfeited under and in terms of Section 13 of the Payment of Gratuity Act.

Accordingly, the petitioner company states that there is no liability for the

company to make any payment to the 4th respondent. However, after the

inquiry, the 2nd respondent issued two notices marked P-17 and P-18

Page 3 of 17

directing the petitioner company to make the gratuity payment. The

petitioner has informed the Department of Labour that Section 13 of the

Payment of Gratuity Act shall apply in deciding the gratuity payments for

the 4th respondent and accordingly, her gratuity had been forfeited.

However, after issuance of the notice marked P-19, the 3rd respondent

issued the certificate dated 27.05.2020 notifying the petitioner to make a

gratuity payment of Rs.1,602,250/- to the 4th respondent and then filed

the application bearing No. 39376/05/20 in the Magistrate Court of

Colombo to recover the said amount of gratuity from the petitioner

company. The statement of objections and the counter objections were

filed in the Magistrate Court, parties were allowed to file written

submissions and the learned Magistrate made an order on 31.08.2023 to

pay the amount mentioned in the said certificate marked X-1.

The petitioner has filed this writ application seeking to quash the

certificate issued by the 3rd respondent marked X-1, quash the notice

issued by the 2nd respondent marked P-19, prevent one or more or all the

respondents from taking any further steps to enforce the learned

Magistrates order marked X-2 and to quash the entire proceedings of

the Magistrate Court case bearing No. 39376/05/20 marked X.

In addition, the petitioner seeks the following interim reliefs:

I. Interim order staying the certificate marked X-1 issued by the 3rd

respondent.

II. Interim order staying the notice marked P-19 issued by the 2nd

respondent.

III. Interim order preventing one or more or all the respondents from

taking any further action in respect of the certificate marked X-1

and/or notice marked P-19.

Page 4 of 17

At the hearing, the learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner and the

learned State Counsel for the 1st to 3rd, and 6th respondents made oral

submissions. Parties moved to file relevant judicial authorities in

substantiating their arguments within one week but no party has filed the

same.

The contention of the learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the

petitioner was that the aforesaid certificate had been issued considering

the fraudulent documents prepared by the 4th respondent. The learned

Presidents Counsel contended further that a charge sheet containing 13

charges was served on the 4th respondent by the registered post but she

refused to accept the charge sheet and failed to reply for the charges. In

addition, the petitioner company has made a complaint against the 4th

respondent to the Criminal Investigation Department for cheating, forgery,

criminal breach of trust, and falsification of accounts. Therefore, the

learned Presidents Counsel contended that the service of the 4th

respondent has been terminated for reasons of fraud, misappropriation of

funds of the employer and the 4th respondents gratuity shall be liable to

be forfeited to the extent of the damage or loss caused to the employer. The

learned Presidents Counsel submitted that the 4th respondent had forged

the signature of the director of the petitioner company, she has used the

company seal without any acknowledgment from the petitioner company

and submitted illegal documents to register for a new EPF number without

the knowledge of the petitioner company. The learned Presidents Counsel

pointed out that the Assistant Commissioner of Labour who held the

inquiry disregarded the documents and facts submitted on behalf of the

petitioner, and issued the said certificate relying on the fraudulent

documents tendered by the 4th respondent. Accordingly, the contention of

the learned Presidents Counsel was that the said certificate is void ab initio

and in consequence, the proceedings of the Magistrate Court is also void

ab initio.

Page 5 of 17

The learned State Counsel appearing for the 1st to 3rd and 6th respondents

contended that even though there is a matter to be looked into in relation

to the certificate, no interim relief prayed for by the petitioner could be

granted because the order of the learned Magistrate marked X-2 is a

judicial pronouncement and, after the judicial pronouncement, the

certificate upon which the decision of the learned Magistrate was based

cannot be challenged. The learned State Counsel contended further that

the writs of certiorari and prohibition prayed for by the petitioner could

not be even considered because the petitioner is guilty of laches. The

learned State Counsel pointed out that the impugned certificate was

issued on 27th May 2020 and the petitioner filed this application on 02nd

October 2023 about 3 years and 4 months later. She contended that

because of this unexplainable long delay, this application should be

dismissed without issuing notices to the respondents.

When the learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner made his

submissions, he drew the attention of the Court to the documents in which

the 4th respondent admitted that her service was terminated by the

petitioner. Hence, it appears that the way of obtaining a new EPF number

is an issue to be considered. The petitioner company has complained to

the CID regarding the 4th respondents forgeries and misappropriation of

funds. However, nowhere it was proved that the 4th respondent prepared

forged documents and obtained a new EPF number. With regard to the

misappropriation of funds, a charge sheet had been served on the 4th

respondent, the 4th respondent has not responded, however, there was no

disciplinary inquiry against her. In the circumstances, although the

petitioner makes allegations of fraud, misappropriation, etc. against the

4th respondent, there is no finding with regard to a fraud, misappropriation

of funds, or any other offence committed by the 4th respondent. When

making an order to pay the amount mentioned in the said certificate, the

Page 6 of 17

learned Magistrate has also considered the fact that there was no

disciplinary inquiry against the 4th respondent and she has not been found

guilty of an offence.

The Section 13 of the Payment of Gratuity Act reads as follows:

Any workman, to whom a gratuity is payable under Part II of this

Act and, whose services have been terminated for reasons of fraud,

misappropriation of funds of the employer, willful damage to

property of the employer, or causing the loss of goods, articles or

property of the employer, shall forfeit such gratuity to the extent of

the damage or loss caused by him.

According to Section 13 of the Act, on an occasion where the employee

causes damage or loss to the employer as a result of fraud or

misappropriation of funds of the employer, the gratuity is liable to be

forfeited. In the case at hand, no such fraud or misappropriation of the 4th

respondent is proved. In the absence of proof with regard to a fraud,

misappropriation, or any other offence committed by the 4th respondent,

there is no legal basis to forfeit the gratuity due to the 4th respondent. In

the above circumstances, the argument that the certificate issued by the

3rd respondent is void ab initio cannot be accepted.

Be that as it may, the key issues to be determined are whether this

application could be maintained to challenge the said certificate after the

learned Magistrate made an order in the application based on that

certificate and whether the Magistrate Court proceedings could be

quashed by this writ application.

Now, the question arises, whether the certificate could be challenged

without challenging the learned Magistrates order with regard to the

Page 7 of 17

application based on that certificate. The answer of the learned Presidents

Counsel was that the order of the learned Magistrate could not be

challenged in a revision application because the Magistrates act in this

matter is only a ministerial act. Therefore, the Learned Presidents Counsel

submitted that the only remedy available was a writ application and that

is why this writ application was filed to quash the said certificate and the

entire proceedings of the Magistrate Court.

If the argument of the learned Presidents Counsel that the learned

Magistrate performs only a ministerial act is accepted, this writ application

cannot be maintained to quash the proceedings of the Magistrate Court

bearing No. 39376/05/20 because in the cases of Gamini Atukorale v.

Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections and Others-

(1998) 3 Sri LR 206 and Seenithamby Palkiararajah v. Dayananda

Dissanayakc, Commissioner of Elections - C.A. Application No.

674/2009 decided on 19.07.2018, it was clearly held that a ministerial

function (performance of duty as prescribed by the law and not a

discretionary function) is not amenable to the prerogative writ jurisdiction.

In the case of Gamini Atukorale v. Dayananda Dissanayake,

Commissioner of Elections and Others - (1998) 3 Sri LR 206, it was held

that a ministerial act by its very nature does not attract the jurisdiction

exercisable by way of a Writ of Certiorari.

In Seenithamby Palkiararajah v. Dayananda Dissanayakc,

Commissioner of Elections, it was held that the thrust of the cases and

the principle is that a ministerial function (performance of duty as

prescribed by the law and not a discretionary function) is not amenable to

the prerogative writ jurisdiction.

Therefore, it is apparent that if the argument of the learned Presidents

Counsel that the learned Magistrate performs only a ministerial act is

Page 8 of 17

accepted, this writ application cannot be maintained to quash the

proceedings of the Magistrate Court.

However, it is necessary to consider the issues that in the recovery process

of gratuity, whether the learned Magistrate performs only a ministerial act

and whether the Order of the learned Magistrate cannot be canvassed in a

revision application.

The question, what is a ministerial function has been discussed in the

aforesaid judgment of Gamini Atukorale v. Dayananda Dissanayake,

Commissioner of Elections and Others and the following portion of the

judgment is important to the case at hand:

Jain & Jain, Principles of Administrative Law, 4th Ed., states at page

325 that: functions dischargeable by the administration may either

be ministerial or discretionary. A ministerial function is one where

the relevant law prescribes the duty to be performed by the

concerned authority in certain and specific terms leaving nothing to

the discretion or judgment of the authority. It does not involve

investigation into disputed facts or making of choices. The authority

concerned acts in strict obedience to the law which imposes on it a

simple and definite duty in respect of which it has no choice.

In a case of recovery of gratuity in the Magistrate Court, the learned

Magistrate has the authority to look into the matter of whether the

employer is liable to pay the amount of gratuity mentioned in the

certificate. After hearing the employer, the learned Magistrate can make

orders to pay the full amount mentioned in the certificate, to pay a part of

the amount mentioned in the certificate or the learned Magistrate can

make an order that the employer is not liable to pay the amount mentioned

in the certificate. So, the learned Magistrate has the discretion to enforce

Page 9 of 17

the certificate or not to enforce the certificate after considering the causes

shown by the employer.

It is apparent that the Magistrates function in recovering gratuity on a

certificate filed is not just a ministerial function but it involves

investigation into disputed facts although the matters that could be

investigated are limited. The learned Magistrate has the discretion to

recover either the full amount or only a part of the amount mentioned in

the certificate. Not only that, the learned Magistrate has the discretion

even not to recover any amount if the learned Magistrate is satisfied that

the employer is not liable to pay the amount mentioned in the certificate.

Therefore, the Magistrates function in recovering gratuity does not fall into

the aforesaid definition of Ministerial Function and I hold that it is a

Judicial function.

X (Employer) V. Deputy Commissioner of Labour and Others reported

in (1991) 1 Sri L.R. 222, is a case where two certificates had been filed by

the Deputy Commissioner of Labour before the learned Magistrate in terms

of section 8(1) of the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983 for the gratuity

payable to two workmen. The order given by the learned Magistrate in this

case was canvassed by way of a Revision Application. In the revision

application, it was held in the Court of Appeal that Showing cause against

certificates issued under the Payment of Gratuity Act No, 12 of 1983, S.8(1)

is not limited to showing that the petitioner was not the person named as

defaulter in the certificate, that he has paid the amount specified in the

certificate and that he is not resident within the jurisdiction of the

Magistrate's Court but also extends to showing that the sums specified in

the certificates are not due or that they have been incorrectly calculated

because under S.8(2) of the Act, the Commissioner's certificate is only

prima facie evidence. It was held further that it is open to the petitioner

Page 10 of 17

to displace the effect of the prima facie evidence by offering further

evidence of an inconsistent or contradictory nature.

Therefore, it is evident firstly, that a revision application could be filed to

challenge an order of the Magistrate in respect of an application of this

nature. Secondly, the aforesaid Court of Appeal decision gives a clear

answer to the issue of whether the process of recovering gratuity in the

Magistrate Court is only a ministerial act or not.

In the aforesaid case, the Petitioner sought leave of the learned Magistrate

to show cause that neither a part nor the whole of the sums referred to in

the certificates were due from the Petitioner. The respondent objected on

the ground that once a certificate is filed by the Commissioner after an

inquiry in order to recover the sums specified in proceedings taken before

the Magistrate, it was not open to the defaulter to show cause that the

sums specified in the certificate are not due.

The learned Magistrate after consideration of the submissions made on

behalf of the Petitioner and the Deputy Commissioner of Labour held that

the only cause that the Petitioner could have shown was to establish:

(a) that the Petitioner was not the person named as the defaulter in

the certificate,

(b) that he has paid the amount specified in the certificate,

(c) that the defaulter was not resident within the jurisdiction of the

Magistrate's court.

In the appeal, the learned State Counsel appearing for the 1st and 3rd

Respondents and the learned Counsel appearing for the 2nd Respondent

(workmen concerned) contended that the use of the words "the Magistrate

shall thereupon summon the defaulter before him to show cause why

Page 11 of 17

further proceedings for the recovery of the sum due should not be taken"

limits the scope of the cause that can be shown by the defaulter. They

contended that the limits of the cause that could be shown as to why

further proceedings should not be taken has been laid down by the

Supreme Court in S.H.L Mohideen V. The Assistant Commissioner of

Co-operative Development of Kalmunai - Argued on 4.4.1977 & decided

on 13.3.1977 and in S.D. Danny V Commissioner of Labour - Argued on

1.9.88 and decided on 16.12.1988.

The decision of the aforesaid case of X (Employer) V. Deputy

Commissioner of Labour and Others was as follows:

With respect, whilst I agree with the decisions cited by learned counsel for

the Respondents, the sections dealing with the recovery provision in the

statutes that came up for consideration were different. The 1st of those cases

were under the provisions of section 59(4) of the Co-operative Societies Law.

Section 59(6) of that law stated that "Nothing in this section shall authorize

or require a District Court or a Magistrate Court thereunder to consider,

examine or decide the correctness of any statement in the certificate of the

Registrar, and the latter case was one where recovery proceedings were

taken under section 38(2) of the Employee's Provident Fund Act and section

38(3) of the said Act states "the correctness of any statement of the

certificate issued by the Commissioner for the purpose of this section shall

not be called in question or examined by the court in any proceedings under

this section and accordingly nothing in this section shall authorize the court

to consider or decide the correctness of any statement in such certificate and

the Commissioner's certificate shall be sufficient evidence that the amount

due under this Act from the defaulting employer has been duly calculated

and that such amount is in default". A similar provision is also made in

section 130(2) of the Inland Revenue Act and section 28(4) of the Employee's

Trust Fund Act where finality and conclusiveness are given by the statute

Page 12 of 17

to the particulars stated in the certificates for the recovery of sums due

thereunder. In the instant case however, as stated above the particulars

given in the certificate is only prima facie evidence of the matters stated

therein and it is in my view open to the defaulter to controvert the position

that the amount is due or that the amount has been incorrectly calculated

by leading oral or documentary evidence.

I totally agree with the aforesaid decision of the Court of Appeal. Section

8(2) of the Payment of Gratuity Act has been correctly analyzed in the said

judgment. According to the aforesaid provisions in the EPF Act, ETF Act

and Inland Revenue Act, Commissioners certificate cannot be questioned

or examined by the court in any proceedings. But according to Section 8(2)

of the Payment of Gratuity Act, the Commissioners certificate is only

prima facie evidence. That is why, it was held in the aforementioned

decision that the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court, extends to allowing

evidence to show that the sums specified in the certificate are not due or

that they have been incorrectly calculated. Therefore, it is precisely clear

that the function of the Magistrate is not merely a ministerial act and it is

a judicial function. The order of the Magistrate is a judicial determination.

In the instant case, the position of the petitioner is that the sum specified

in the certificate is not due from the petitioner company. That position

could have been established in the Magistrate Court according to the

aforesaid Court of Appeal judgment. If the said position was not accepted

by the learned Magistrate, the petitioner could have filed a revision

application against the order of the learned Magistrate. The petitioner

failed to take both steps.

As explained above, it has been decided by this Court in aforementioned

two cases as well as the Supreme Court in the case of Gamini Atukorale v.

Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections and Others that a writ

Page 13 of 17

application cannot be maintained to challenge a ministerial act. Now, this

court has decided that the learned Magistrates order was not a ministerial

act but a judicial determination. Then, the question arises whether the

learned Magistrates order could be challenged in this writ application, as

it is not a mere ministerial act but a judicial determination.

In the case of Wickremasinghage Francis Kulasooriya and another v.

Officer-In-Charge, Police Station, Kirindiwela- CA (Writ) Application

No. 338/2011 decided on 22 October 2018, the issue of whether the Writ

jurisdiction of this Court conferred under Article 140 of the Constitution

would extend to review an order of the Magistrate's Court has been

considered. It was held in this case that If the Writ jurisdiction is invoked

where an equally effective remedy is available, an explanation should be

offered as to why that equally effective remedy has not been resorted to.

This Court of Appeal decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court in SC

Appeal 52/2021 decided on 14. 07.2023. In this Supreme Court judgment,

the following portion from the judgment of Ishak V. Lakshman Perera

Director of Customs and Others (2003) 3 Sri L.R 18 has been cited

as follows:

This position was considered by Shirani Thilakawardena J in the

case of Ishak V. Lakshman Perera Director of Customs and Others

(2003) 3 Sri LR 18 as follows; Where there is an alternative procedure

which will provide the applicant with a satisfactory remedy the Courts

will usually insist on an applicant exhausting that remedy before

seeking judicial review. In doing so the Court is coming to a

discretionary decision. Where there is a choice of another separate

process outside the Courts, a true question for the exercise of

discretion exists. For the Court to require the alternative procedure to

be exhausted prior to resorting to judicial review is in accord with the

judicial review being properly regarded as being a remedy of

Page 14 of 17

last resort. It is important that the process should not be clogged

with unnecessary cases, which are perfectly capable of being dealt

with in another tribunal. It can also be the situation that Parliament,

by establishing an alternative procedure, indicated either expressly

or by implication that it intends that procedure to be used, in

exercising its discretion the Court will attach importance to the

indication of Parliament intention. (Emphasis added)

When the remedy of revision application was available to the petitioner,

the petitioner company has not resorted to the said remedy and the only

explanation was that the remedy of revision was not available to the

petitioner. It has already been decided that the said explanation cannot be

accepted. Hence, the petitioner has not given an acceptable reason for not

resorting to the effective remedy of filing a revision application against the

order of the learned Magistrate. In view of the above decision, the petitioner

cannot invoke the discretionary remedy of writ jurisdiction of this court to

quash the Magistrate Court order and its proceedings.

The most vital issue in this application is the delay. The learned State

Counsel appearing for the 1st to 3rd and 6th respondents contended that

the petitioner is guilty of laches for the unexplained delay. The learned

State counsel pointed out that the impugned certificate was issued on

27.05.2020 and this application was filed on 2nd October 2023, after three

years and four months. Therefore, she contended that this application

should be dismissed for the reason of delay alone.

The learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the petitioner did not give

any explanation for the delay. Even in the petition filed by the petitioner,

no explanation for the delay is given. Citing the judgment of Biso Menika

v. Cyril de Alwis and Others - (1982) 1 Sri L.R. 368, the learned

Presidents Counsel urged to consider the merits of this application

Page 15 of 17

disregarding the delay. In the aforesaid case of Biso Menika, the following

observations have been made: When the Court has examined the record

and is satisfied the order complained of is manifestly erroneous or without

jurisdiction, the Court would be loath to allow the mischief of the order to

continue and reject the application simply on the ground of delay, unless

there are very extraordinary reasons to justify such rejection. Where the

authority concerned has been acting altogether without basic jurisdiction,

the Court may grant relief in spite of the delay unless the conduct of the

party shows that he has approbated the usurpation of jurisdiction. In any

such event, the explanation of the delay should be considered

sympathetically.

Taking into consideration the aforementioned decision, now I proceed to

consider whether the delay pertaining to this application could be

disregarded. The delay affects this application in the following manner.

Firstly, after issuing the certificate marked X in 2020.05.27, the petitioner

had ample time to challenge the said certificate. The learned Presidents

Counsel for the petitioner contended that the certificate is void ab initio. If

so, soon after the certificate was issued, the petitioner could have

challenged the certificate in a proper forum without showing causes as to

why the amount mentioned in the certificate should not be recovered

because according to the petitioner, the certificate is invalid. However, the

petitioner did not take any steps to challenge the certificate until the

learned Magistrate made an order to pay the amount mentioned in the

certificate. However, it has been decided previously in this judgment that

the argument that the Commissioners certificate is void ab initio cannot

be accepted. So, in the absence of any acceptable explanation regarding

the delay of more than three years and four months the writ jurisdiction

of this court cannot be exercised. Hence, this writ application must be

dismissed on the ground of unexplained delay alone.

Page 16 of 17

In this application, the main relief that the petitioner sought is to quash

the certificate marked X issued by the 3rd respondent. In addition, the

petitioner sought to quash the notice issued by the 2nd respondent marked

P-19 and to quash the entire proceedings of the Magistrate Court.

Therefore, the second issue that arises as a result of the delay is whether

the petitioner could ask to quash the certificate when the learned

Magistrate has already made a determination on the said certificate.

After filing the certificate in the Magistrate Court on 27.05.2020, summons

were issued to the petitioner company on 15.12.2022. In an application of

this nature to recover the gratuity on a certificate filed, a petitioner who

comes before the Magistrate Court on summons has two options. Either

to challenge the certificate by way of writ application or to show cause

before the Magistrate as to why the amount mentioned in the certificate

should not be recovered. The petitioner appeared in the Magistrate Court

chose the second option and moved for a date to show cause. By electing

to show cause before the Magistrate as to why the sum mentioned in the

certificate should not be recovered, the petitioner has waved off the right

of challenging the certificate. After testing whether the second option

would be successful, the petitioner cannot resort to the first option of

challenging the certificate. If the certificate was void ab initio as the learned

Presidents Counsel contended, the petitioner could have challenged the

said certificate soon after it was submitted to the Magistrate Court.

Even after the 15th December 2022 before the order is pronounced on

31.08.2023, the petitioner has not taken any step to challenge the

certificate. By making an application before the learned Magistrate to show

cause on 15.12.2022, the petitioner opted not to challenge the certificate

in a proper forum but to show cause before the Magistrate Court.

Thereafter, when the learned Magistrate delivered the order directing the

petitioner to pay the amount mentioned in the certificate, even the said

Page 17 of 17

order was not challenged by exercising the available remedy of revision

application. After three years and four months of issuing the certificate,

the petitioner filed this writ application asking to quash both the certificate

and the Magistrate Court proceedings. Hence, it is apparent that the time

to challenge the certificate has passed. The learned Magistrates order has

not been challenged by way of a revision application. Now, what remains

is only to implement the order of the learned Magistrate.

For the reasons stated above, I hold that this application cannot be

maintained for the reliefs prayed for in the petition. Accordingly, I refuse

to grant interim reliefs prayed for in the petition and refuse to issue notices

to the respondents.

The writ application is dismissed without costs.
