Sasi Mahendran, J.

The instance appeal has been lodged to set aside the Judgment dated 02.07.2019.

The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted

before the High Court of Kegalle for the following offences;

1. The alleged murder of Mohommed Mihilar Thahira Sirin (the Deceased) on or

about 14.02.2012 and thereby committing an offense punishable under Section 296

read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

2. In the course of the transaction for causing grievous hurt to Mohommed Naim

Amardeen Begam Nausia by throwing acid and thereby committing an offence

punishable under section 315 of the Penal Code.

3. In the course of the transaction for causing grievous hurt to Mohommed Mustafa

Safni Mustafa by throwing acid and thereby committing an offence punishable

under section 315 of the Penal Code.

4. In the course of the transaction for causing grievous hurt to Ahammed Munas

Safni by throwing acid and thereby committing an offence punishable under

section 315 of the Penal Code.

After the conclusion of the trial, the Learned Trial Judge convicted the Accused of

all 4 counts and imposed the death penalty for the 1st count, and for 2nd, the 3rd, and 4th

counts 3 years of Rigorous Imprisonment, and a fine of Rs.10,000/- with a default 6 months

of Rigorous imprisonment for each count separately was imposed.

The above-said Accused is the husband of the deceased, the father of the victims

in counts 3 and 4, and the victim in the 2nd Count is the Accused's mother-in-law

The only ground of appeal that was raised is that the Appellant suffered from

mental illness at the time of committing these offences and the Learned High Court Judge

has failed to consider it.

Before answering the above issue, it is pertinent to look into the relevant facts of

the instant case.

The version of the Prosecution is that the Appellants son Safni Mustafa who was

10 years old at the time of the incident gave evidence mentioning that the deceased, the

Appellant, and his family members were watching television. Later on, while coming

down from the stairs Accused threw some liquid at the parties who were watching

Television. This liquid was suspected to be an acid. Then the deceased shouted Burning,

then she ran and fell into a drain. The little girl Maria and all the others presented were

also burnt from said thrown liquid.

The deceased was taken to the Hemmatagama Hospital and was then transferred

to Mawanella Hospital. The evidence was collaborated by Munas Safni the elder son of

the deceased. Begam Nausia mother of the deceased collaborated with the narratives

given by the eyewitnesses.

It was revealed that all three witnesses were unaware of whether the Appellant

obtained any treatment for any mental illnesses.

After the conclusion of the Prosecution trial, In the Dock statement Accused

declared that he had been taking medicine for a mental illness for over 30 years and stated

that he was unaware as to what happened to him at the time of throwing acid.

The consultant Psychiatrist Sunil Pushpakumara Kandapola Arachchige who

examined the Accused about two weeks after the commission of the offence of murder,

informed that the Appellant was suffering from Schizophrenia and he had examined him

only twice. He further stated that from the information received from his family members,

the Accused had previously taken medication from Kandy Hospital.

When we perused the records the Learned High Court Judge has taken steps to

call for a medical report.

Thereafter the Learned High Court Judge simply proceeded to commence the

trial. When we perused the entire record, we couldnt find the medical report. It is a

cardinal principle of the criminal jurisprudence that the Accused must understand the

nature of the charge proceeding against him and also be able to assist counsel in

presenting his defence and that he was fit to plead and stand his trial.

Page 6 of 7

The Learned High Court Judge himself called for the medical certificate from the

psychiatrist but without any inquiry, he had allowed the Prosecution to lead evidence and

thereafter found the Accused guilty of murder.

It will be convenient to refer at this stage to those provisions of the Criminal

Procedure Code which have a bearing on the question of procedure arising for Medical

Condition at the commencement of the trial Chapter XXXI of the Criminal Procedure

Code.

Section 375(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 read as follows;

if any person committed for trial before the High Court appears to the Court at

his trial to be of unsound mind and consequently incapable of making this defence, the

jury or (where the trial is without a jury) the Judge of the High Court shall in the first

instance try the fact of such unsoundness and incapacity, and if satisfied of the fact shall

find accordingly and thereupon the trial shall be postponed.

There's no evidence to establish that the Learned High Court Judge had a voir dire

inquiry to find out whether the Accused is competent and fit to undergo his trial.

I hold that the failure to hold an inquiry as required in section 375 (1) is a violation

of the fundamental principle of Criminal Procedure. There is evidence by Dr. Sunil

Pushpakumara Kandapola Arachchige who examined the Accused twice and a complaint

made by the deceased stating Accused had a long history of mental illness. The Learned

High Court Judge could have acted under sections 376 to 379 and he would have

proceeded as directed by Chapter XV. Instead of following the procedure the Learned High

Court Judge proceeded the trial and convicted the Appellant for the Murder.

Since the Accused is convicted and sentenced, we set aside the conviction and

sentence imposed by the High Court Judge. We hold that the Learned High Court Judge

has failed to follow the procedure laid in the Criminal Procedure Code as the Accused has

failed to understand the charges against him. Therefore, we set aside the conviction

imposed on 02.07.2019.

Further, we direct the commissioner general of prison to take steps under Section

381 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Appeal is allowed.

The Registrar is directed to send a certified copy of the Judgement to the

Commissioner General of Prison.
