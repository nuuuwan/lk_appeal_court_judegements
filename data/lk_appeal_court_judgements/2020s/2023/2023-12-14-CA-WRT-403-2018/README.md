The petitioners through this application seek relief by way of Writ of Certiorari to

quash the decision of the 1st and/or 2nd and/or 3rd and/or 4th and/or 5th

respondents, manifested in documents marked P5, P7 and P9. The petitioners

further pray for a grant of an interim order staying any one or more of the 1st

5th respondents from initiating proceedings in the Magistrate Court to enforce the

aforementioned decision and/or decisions.

The salient facts of the case are as follows. The petitioners are the children of the

late Jayananda Rathnaike, who was the owner of the properties set out

hereinafter which were managed by the 6th respondent. Both the 1st and 2nd

petitioners are presently residing abroad and thereby have instituted this

application through their lawful Power-of-Attorney holders.

The petitioners state that on or about 07.05.2015 the 6th respondent preferred a

complaint to the 1st respondent (the Commissioner General of Labour) against

the 1st petitioner alleging that;

- The 6th respondent was acting as a manager to the estate name

Iriyagasthanne at Wattegama and the premises bearing No.17, Fareed

Place, Colombo 04 owned by late Jayananda Rathnaike,

- Upon the demise of the said Jayananda Rathnaike, the 6th respondent

continued to perform the said function of the manager of the said

properties under and upon the request of the 1st petitioner,

- The 6th respondent was purportedly receiving a salary of Rs. 85,000/-

monthly,

- The 6th respondents services were allegedly discontinued by the

petitioners on or about 30.04.2015.

And thereby through his complaint alleged his entitlement to contributions to

have been made to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Employee Trust Fund

(ETF) as well as other statutory dues.

5

CA-WRT-403-18 Page 5 of 12 14/12/2023 IJ-36-23

The petitioner states that during the inquiry conducted by the 5th respondent

(District Labour Office Colombo West) into the aforesaid complaint made by the

6th respondent, the 1st petitioner vehemently objected the said complaint as the

6th respondent never served under the 1st petitioner or the petitioners late father,

in the capacity of an employee and therefor is not entitled to have contributions

to EPF and ETF.

Upon the completion of the said inquiry the matter was fixed for order on

10.05.2016, which was subsequently postponed due to further proceedings

required by the 5th respondent. Nevertheless, after over a year the inquiry was

finally taken up on 30.10.2017 and the 5th respondent pronounced her decision

orally. The petitioner states that the 5th respondent wrongfully pronounced her

decision by holding that the 6th respondent is a monthly paid employee of the 1st

petitioner and therefore entitled to have contributions made to the EPF. One of

the purported reasons for the decision of the 5th respondent was the fact that a

case in the Labour Tribunal instituted by the 6th respondent against the

petitioners was settled by the parties. Furthermore, the petitioners state that

upon the decision of the 5th respondent, the 1st petitioner requested to be issued

with a copy of the 5th respondent's findings. However, the same has been refused

by the 5th respondent on the basis that permission had to be obtained by higher

authorities.

On or about 06.11.2017 following the oral decision of the 5th respondent, the 2nd

respondent issued a letter to the 1st respondent stating that it is decided that the

6th respondent is a monthly paid employee and that EPF payment will be payable

and calculated from July 1991 to April 2015 along with the unpaid salary for the

month of April 2015. Yet the reason for such decision nor the quantum of EPF

had been specified in the said letter dated 06.11.2017. Aggrieved by the said

decision the 1st petitioner on or about 10.11.2017 preferred an Appeal to the 1st

respondent stating several grounds upon which the decision made by the 2nd

and/or 4th and/or 5th and/or respondents is rendered erroneous. Yet, the

petitioners claim that up to date no response has been received with this regard.

6

CA-WRT-403-18 Page 6 of 12 14/12/2023 IJ-36-23

Furtherance to the aforementioned decision manifested by the letter marked P5

issued by the 2nd respondent, the 4th respondent issued a further letter marked

P7 to the 1st and 2nd petitioners on or about 30.05.2018 directing the payment of

a sum Rs. 1, 288,500/- in respect of EPF contribution of the 6th respondent. The

petitioners further state that although the 1st petitioner is the party against whom

the 6th respondent made the complaint, the letter dated 30.05.2018 issued by the

4th respondent wrongfully holds the 1st petitioners brother, the 2nd petitioner of

the instant application as being liable to make for the payment of EPF, together

with the 1st petitioner.

In response to the above letter, the petitioner by a letter dated 10.07.2018,

through her power of attorney drew the attention of the 4th respondent to the fact

that no response has been received with regard to the appeal lodged by the

petitioners. However, instead of responding to the appeal lodged by the

petitioners and the aforementioned letter dated 10.07.2018, the 1st and/or 4th

respondents issued a letter (P9) dated 20.07.2018 addressed to the petitioners

re-iterating the decision manifest in P5 and P7 insisting that in an event the said

sum of Rs. 1, 288,500/- is not paid on or before the 15.08.2018 actions will be

taken against the petitioners at the Magistrates Court. Aggrieved by the said

decision/s of the 1st 5th respondents manifest in the said documents marked

P5, P7 and P9 the petitioner invokes the writ jurisdiction under Article 140 of the

Constitution.

The contentions brought forward by the petitioners through their submissions

are as follows: the petitioners firmly affirmed that the 1st -5th respondents have

failed to consider the evidence placed on record during the inquiry held by the 5th

respondent which clearly establishes the fact that there was no employer-

employee relationship between the petitioners and the 6th respondent, and as a

consequence of which the 6th respondent should not be entitled to payment of

EPF.

The petitioner while bringing forward this argument draws the attention of the

court to the document marked P3(b) which states that the late Jayananda

Ratnaike had requested the 6th respondent to undertake the financial and

7

CA-WRT-403-18 Page 7 of 12 14/12/2023 IJ-36-23

operational management of the two properties in question, which was then

accepted by the 6th respondent. Furthermore, at the conclusion of the letter the

late Jayananda Ratnaike referring to the 6th respondent states that he is most

grateful for his generous help which the petitioners claim ex facie clear that same

cannot be a letter of appointment. Through document marked P3(c) the petitioner

states that the 6th respondent confirms that the said late Jayananda Ratnaike

was a relation of his and inter alia that the said Jayananda had assigned the

management of his movable and immovable properties to the 6th respondent and

the 6th respondent in turn had appointed employees to look after the said

properties. As such it is asserted that nowhere in the said statement does the 6th

respondent state that he himself was an employee of the late Jayananda

Ratnaike.

Moreover, the petitioners claim that the email marked P3(h) written by the 6th

respondent to the 1st petitioner, inter alia states that I am not a monthly paid

worker of your father which clearly establishes the 6th respondent did not

consider himself to be an employee of late Jayananda Ratnaike.

The petitioners also state that the Rs. 85,000/- claimed by the 6th petitioner as

his salary was in fact a payment in respect of running and maintaining the said

properties. The petitioners also draw the attention to the document marked R1,

report submitted by the 5th respondents. Under the said R1 document heading

the 5th respondent who conducted the inquiry specifically state that

the 6th respondent has failed to submit evidence to establish that the Rs.

85,000/- set out in the bank statements were in fact paid as salary and thus the

position of the 6th respondent that the said Rs. 85,000/- was his salary, cannot

be accepted. The petitioners also emphasized on the fact that no reasonable

employer would grant salary increase to an employee in the manner the 6th

respondent claims to have increased.

Based on the findings of the 5th respondent contained in the report marked R1,

the petitioners claim that it is clear that the only factor upon which the 5th

respondent arrived at the purported conclusion that the 6th respondent is an

employee and thereby entitled to EPF, is the settlement that was entered into

8

CA-WRT-403-18 Page 8 of 12 14/12/2023 IJ-36-23

between the parties in the Labour Tribunal case No. 32/RM/31/2015. The

documents clearly set out the fact that the said settlement was entered into solely

for the purpose of fully and finally settling the claims made by the 6th respondent

by his application to the Labour Tribunal for the purpose of recovering the

original vehicle registration book pertaining to the vehicle No. 52-0344 which was

in possession of the 6th respondent.

The learned state counsel appearing for the 1st 5th respondents made

submissions as follows. The learned counsel during the submissions emphasized

on the facts that the 6th respondent was employed by late Jayananda Ratnaike

since 01.03.1991 and upon his demise on 04.04.2014 the 6th respondents

employment was continued by the petitioners as the heirs of late Jayananda

Ratnaike. The 6th respondent has also testified to the effect that salary was

credited to his bank account by the employer on a monthly basis and subsequent

to the demise of Jayananda Ratnaike, the petitioners paid the 6th respondent a

sum of Rs. 85,000/- per month and in those circumstances the 6th respondent

was deemed a monthly paid employee.

The respondents also highlighted on the fact that at the inquiry conducted by the

5th Respondent, it was revealed that the recruitment, payments and assignment

of work have been done by the employer. And further, since the payment of salary

was discontinued by the petitioners since April 2015, the 6th respondent filed an

application before the Labour Tribunal holden in Ratmalana against the unlawful

termination of the employment. The settlement was reached on 19.04.2016 by

the 1st petitioner on behalf of all the heirs before the Labour Tribunal pursuant

to the admission that the 6th respondent was an employee and there was a

termination of employment in terms of Section 3(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act

(hereinafter the IDA). The learned counsel further states that during the tribunal

inquiry there was no contention by the petitioners to whether the 6th respondent

was considered as a monthly paid employee.

When a complaint is made by an applicant for statutory dues of EPF, the scope

of the inquiry of the inquiring officer is to ascertain whether the applicant is an

employee of the employer, and further if the employment is governed by the

9

CA-WRT-403-18 Page 9 of 12 14/12/2023 IJ-36-23

provisions of Employees Provident Fund Act (hereinafter the EPF Act) whether

the employer has failed to pay statutory dues on behalf of the said employee to

the Commissioner of Labour.

The learned state counsel firmly affirmed that the 6th respondent falls within the

ambit of an employee under the EPF Act. According to interpretation of Section

47 of the EPF Act an employee is defined as:

employee means any person who has entered into or works under

a contract with an employer in any capacity, whether the contract is

expressed or implied, or oral or in writing, and whether it is a contract

of service or of apprenticeship or a contract personally to execute any

work of labour, and includes anu person ordinarily employed under

any such contract, whether such person is or is not in employment at

any particular time, and does not include a detached worker for a

period of time specified in a social security agreement applicable to

such detached worker.

Through the document marked R1 (report dated 22.05.2017) submitted by the

5th respondent concludes to identify the 6th respondent as an employee of the late

Jayananda Ratnaike, even though there are contentions and uncertainty with

regard to the salary payments made to the 6th respondent. The 5th respondent

further states that having considered the matter pertaining thereto, she sought

the recommendation of the Chief Legal Officer by the report dated 22.05.2017.

The Chief Legal Officer, by his letter dated 24.05.2017 directed the 5th respondent

to proceed to charge the defaulted EPF from the petitioners.

However, the petitioner has contested the findings of R1 on multiple grounds:

I. Failure to consider evidence presented during the inquiry conducted by the 5th

respondent. This evidence includes references P3(b)/P3(c), P3(h).

II. Disputes regarding the 5th respondent's conclusion in R1 that Rs. 85,000/- was

not the correct salary.

10

CA-WRT-403-18 Page 10 of 12 14/12/2023 IJ-36-23

III. An assertion that the conclusion reached by R1 is inaccurately based on a

settlement (No. 32/RM/31/2015) that was reached for a specific reason.

Despite this, it is noteworthy that the arguments put forth by the learned state

counsel for the respondents are deemed acceptable. Considering the above-

mentioned it is acceptable that the 6th respondent falls with the ambit of

employee as per the EPF Act and thus is entitled to all statutory benefits.

Thereby, the calculation of EPF should be done in accordance with the EPF Act.

Having thus determined that the petitioner is obligated to pay the 6th

Respondents entitlements under the EPF Act vis--vis the employer-employee

relationship that has been recognized, this Court will now turn to the

computation of the EPF amount.

When determining the calculation of the EPF payment it is salient to pay attention

to Section 10 of the EPF Act as it sets out the percentage of nominal contributions

that needs to be made by both the employer and employee as a contribution to

the fund. The section reads as follows:

(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section and of section

27, an employee to whom this Act applies shall, in respect of each month

during which he works in a covered employment be liable to pay to the Fund

a contribution of an amount equal to eight per centum of his total earnings

from the employment during that month.

(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section and of section

27, the employer of every employee to whom this Act applies and who is

liable to pay contributions to the Fund shall, in respect of each month during

which such employee is in a covered employment under such employer, be

liable to pay to the Fund on or before the last day of the succeeding month,

a contribution of an amount equal to twelve per centum of such employees

total earnings from that employment during that month

(3) The liability of an employee in a covered employment and his employer

to pay contributions under this section shall commence on the day

immediately after the date fixed in relation to such employment by the

11

CA-WRT-403-18 Page 11 of 12 14/12/2023 IJ-36-23

Minister by Order published in the Gazette. Different dates may be fixed

under this subsection for different classes of employees in the same covered

employment. (Emphasis added)

Thus, when the computation of EPF is done the statutory percentage of

contributions by employee should be considered as 8% of his total earnings and

12% from the employer based on the total earnings of the employee.

In accordance with Section 15 of the EPF Act the employer of an employee is duty

bound to payment of contributions dues from employees. The section reads as

follows:

The employer of an employee to whom this Act applies shall deduct

and pay to the Fund the contribution for each month of such employee

under this Act before the last day of the succeeding month from the

earnings of the employee; and a contribution paid under this section

to the Fund by such employer on behalf of such employee shall be

deemed to have been paid to the fund by such employee.

Section 28 of EPF Act states that the decision on the calculation of EPF is within

the determination of the Commissioner. The section reads as follows:

All claims to benefit shall be determined by the Commissioner or by

way officer authorized in that behalf by him and the determination of

the commissioner or such officer shall, subject to any decision on an

appeal made against such determination in accordance with the

provisions of this Act, be final.

According to documents marked P5, P7 & P9 the time period for the calculation

of EPF is identified as 1991/07 2015/03.

When considering the discussion and findings of R1 it is more evident to state

that prior to 2006 there is no evidence to suggest that the 6th respondent was an

employee of the said petitioners within the interpretation of the EPF Act, as the

bank statements and other documentations provided are dated from 2006

onwards. Furthermore, even after 2006, according to R1, Rs. 85,000/- cannot be

12

CA-WRT-403-18 Page 12 of 12 14/12/2023 IJ-36-23

accepted as his fixed salary payment. Nevertheless, according to R1 it is stated

with rational reasons that for the purpose of EPF computation the acceptable

amount to be considered would be Rs. 25,000/- as a payment since 2006/08.

Thereby, the consideration of service since 1991, as per documents marked P5,

P7 & P9, is unacceptable. Yet according to the findings of R1 it could be said that

the 6th respondent is entitled to claim for statutory dues for the period from

2006/08 to 2015/04.

Hence, it could be asserted that the 1st to 5th respondents need to reconsider

the EPF calculation period and ensure that the statutory nominal contribution

percentage for EPF payment is accurately determined in EPF calculations.

Considering all the above-mentioned this Court deems the 6th respondent can be

considered as an employee of the petitioners and thereby is entitled to the

payment of EPF. Yet however, it could also be stated that the calculation period

and calculation amount of EPF in documents marked P5, P7 & P9 are erroneous.

Thereby, this Court deems to annul the orders in documents marked P5, P7 &

P9. This Court further directs the 1st respondent- Commissioner General of

Labour to recalculate the statutory dues as stated in this order.
