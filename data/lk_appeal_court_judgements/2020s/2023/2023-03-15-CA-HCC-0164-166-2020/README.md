JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) were indicted in the High Court of Colombo under Section 296

read with Section 32 of the Penal Code for committing the murder of Bodhiya

Baduge Dayaratna alias Ukkun on or about 03rd June 2003.

The trial commenced before the Judge of the High Court of Kalutara as the

Appellants had opted for a non-jury trial. After the conclusion of the

prosecutions case, the learned High Court Judge had called for the defence.

The 1st and the 2nd Appellants had made dock statements and had denied

the charge. The 3rd Appellant had given evidence from witness box, and he

3

too had denied the charge. After considering the evidence presented by both

parties, the learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellants for

murder and sentenced them to death on 14/07/2020.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsels for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants had given consent for this matter to be argued in their absence

due to the Covid 19 pandemic restrictions. Further, at the time of argument

the Appellants were connected via Zoom platform from prison.

Background of the Case.

In this case the deceased was living with PW1 and PW2 more than 2 years

in the same house. He was to be married to the sister of PW1. PW2 is the

wife of PW1.

The 1st Appellant is an uncle of the deceased. The 2nd Appellant is a relative

of the deceased, while 3rd Appellant is a person known to the deceased. The

incident happened in dark as the village where PW1s house situated was

not provided with electricity. At the time of the incident PW1s house was lit

with three kerosine bottle lamps.

On the date of the incident, PW1 had gone to a neighbors house to assist

him to bring medicine for his child. When he returned home the deceased

was seated on the bed and the deceased had told him that the Appellants

had assaulted him. At that time, the witnesss wife and mother were also in

the house. The wife, the PW2 had told him that the Appellants had entered

the house through the window after removing the mackintosh. Even though

the deceased did not want to go to the hospital, after much difficulty the

deceased was taken to the Baduraliya Hospital, and he died at the hospital.

PW2 is the wife of PW1. She was at home when the incident had taken place.

According to her when she was sleeping, she heard somebody calling

Chootiyo, open the door. Chootiyo is the nick name of her husband PW1.

She identified that voice is of the 1st Appellant. Thereafter the 1st Appellant

4

had come into the house and taken the deceased out. She had seen the other

Appellants at the front of the house. Then she heard someone shouting not

to assault him. Thereafter she had seen the deceased fallen in front of the

house. The deceased had asked for water and PW1 had come home after the

deceased was taken into the house. She heard the deceased telling her

husband that the Appellants assaulted him.

The JMO who conducted the postmortem of the deceased had stated that

there were two injuries on the deceaseds body. The cause of the death was

blunt force injury to back of the head which resulted in an internal

hemorrhage, and it is a necessarily fatal injury. The 2nd injury is a contusion

at the rear of the chest behind 7th,8th, and 9th ribs. The injuries are caused

by blunt force and could have been caused by clubs. The JMO also opined

that the deceased could speak for some time after the injuries.

Having satisfied that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case

against the Appellants, the learned Trial Judge had called for the defence

and the 1st and 2nd Appellants had made dock statements and denied the

charge. The 3rd Appellant had given evidence from witness box, and he too

denied the charge.

The Appellants had separately canvassed their Appeal grounds through their

Counsel.

The First Appellant had filed following grounds of appeal.

1. Although the case for the prosecution depends on the dying

deposition of the deceased, the infirmity of a dying deposition is not

discussed in the judgment.

2. The identification of the Appellants is not considered adequately in

the judgment.

3. The Learned High Court Judge accepts the infirmities of prosecution

witnesses but proceeds to say that people are uneducated and given

evidence after 13 years of the incident.

5

4. The Learned High Court Judge has concluded that the defence has

not challenged the prosecution version that the Appellants are the

culprits in this case.

5. Though all the accused have been convicted based on common

intention, common intention was not considered in the judgment

with the laid down principles.

6. The defence case has been rejected applying the probability test, but

not given reasons for the same.

7. In view of these matters the accused were not given a fair trial.

The second Appellant had filed following grounds of appeal.

1. The case against the 2nd Appellant has not been proved beyond

reasonable grounds.

2. Application of the Ellenborough principle is unfair in this case.

3. The identification of the 2nd Appellant is tainted with infirmities.

4. Although the Learned High Court Judge had relied on

circumstantial evidence to come to his conclusion, has not

elaborated in his judgment.

5. The dock statement of the 2nd Appellant has not been given due

consideration in the judgment.

6. Absence of shared intention and motive.

The third Appellant had filed following grounds of appeal.

1. The prosecution had failed to prove the identity of the accused

Appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

2. The Learned High Court Judge had rejected the evidence of the 3rd

Appellant without giving reasons.

3. Learned High Court Judge had wrongly applied the law and thereby

shifted an extra burden on the accused appellant by expecting the

accused Appellant to explain the items of evidence placed by the

prosecution without taking into consideration that the accused

6

appellant had totally denied the participation in the crime. Vide

page 393.

4. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to take into consideration

about common murderous intention.

In this case there are three grounds urged by the Learned Counsels which

are to be discussed first. Those grounds are set out below:

1. Dying deposition of the deceased.

2. Identification of the Appellants.

3. Infirmities in the prosecution witnesses.

In a criminal trial the above mentioned three grounds of appeal are especially

important as the outcome of the case is very much depended on said

grounds. Hence, considering those grounds as common grounds, I now

proceed to discuss each of the same below.

In the first common ground, the Learned Presidents Counsel strenuously

argued that as the prosecution depends on a dying deposition of the

Appellant, the Learned High Court Judge should have discussed the

infirmities in a dying deposition in his judgment.

As the prosecution relies on the dying declaration made by the deceased, it

is very important to discuss the relevant laws pertaining to the acceptance

of dying declaration as evidence in criminal trials under our law.

According to Section 32(1) of Evidence Ordinance,

Statements, written, or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is

dead, or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving

evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of

delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the case, appears to the

court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the following cases: -

(1) when the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his

death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which

7

resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that persons

death comes into question.

Such statements are relevant whether the person who made them was or

was not, at the time when they were made, under expectation of death, and

whatever may be the nature of the proceedings in which the cause of his

death comes into question.

Therefore, following requirements must necessarily be established before any

evidence is led under section 32(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

1. That the maker of the statement is dead.

2. That the statement made by the deceased refers to his/her cause of

death or to the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in

his/her death.

Hence such evidence would become admissible only where the cause of death

of the person making the statement is in question in the particular judicial

proceedings. Admissibility of such evidence would ultimately be decided by

the trial judge as per Section 136 of Evidence Ordinance.

In Dharmawansa Silva and Another v. The Republic of Sri Lanka [1981]

2 Sri.L.R.439 it was held:

When a dying statement is produced, three questions arise for the Court.

Firstly, whether it is authentic. Secondly if it is authentic whether it is

admissible in whole or part. Thirdly, the value of the whole or part that is

admitted. A dying deposition is not inferior evidence but it is wrong to give

it added sanctity

In Sigera v. Attorney General [2011] 1 S.L.R.201 it was held that:

An accused can be convicted of murder based on mainly and solely on

a dying declaration made by a deceased.

8

In this case, PW2 was at home when the incident had taken place. In her

evidence she had stated that when she went out after the assault the

deceased requested some water first. After drinking water, according to PW2,

the deceased had told her that the Appellants had assaulted him. Prior to

the assault, the 1st Appellant also known as Bande Mama called the deceased

and requested him to open the door. She identified the 1st Appellant by his

voice at that time. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

PW1 in his examination-in-chief took up the position that when he came

home, the deceased was on the bed inside the room. But he had told police

that the deceased was lying fallen face downward at the compound of the

In Tapinder Singh v. State of Punjab [1970] AIR SC 1586 the court held

that:

In fact inasmuch as a dying declaration is admitted on the basis of

necessity an obligation lies on the Learned Trial Judge to direct the jury

to be on its guard to scrutinize all relevant surrounding circumstances

Considering the evidence given by PW1 and PW2, the dying deposition of the

deceased creates a serious issue in respect of the credibility of their evidence.

The contradiction marked V8 and V1 creates a serious doubt about the

evidentiary value of PW1 and PW2 which should have been considered by

the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment. Hence this ground of appeal

has merit.

In the second common ground of appeal, the Learned Counsels contends

that the identification of the Appellants has not been proven beyond

reasonable doubt due to the contradictory nature of the evidence given by

PW2.

Proper identification of the accused persons is a fundamental point that

needs to be determined at the beginning of a criminal trial. In this case it is

very important to discuss whether the prosecution has established the

identity of the Appellants beyond reasonable doubt. If the identification is

compromised, the net result would be the acquittal of the accused persons

12

from the case. Hence evidence of identification should be considered very

seriously due to its delicate nature. In this case an identification parade had

not been held in respect of the Appellants.

Visual identification evidence is when an eyewitness identifies a suspect from

memory. It can sometimes be unreliable due to poor light conditions.

The following judgments are very important as it elaborates the vitality of

identification evidence and discusses how the fate of a case depends upon it.

In Karunaratne Mudiyansege Madduma Bandara v. The Attorney General

CA/190-192/11 decided on 15/03/2013, the court acquitted the accused

on the ground that the identification of the accused persons have not been

proven beyond reasonable doubt because the prosecutrix failed to divulge

the names of the accused persons to the police who was known to her prior

to the incident.

In R v. Turnbull [1977] QB 224 the court held that:

Where the case against an accused depends wholly or substantially on

the correctness of one or more identifications of the accused-which the

defence alleges to be mistaken-the judge should be cautious before

convicting the accused in reliance on the correctness of the

identification(s). The judge should take into consideration that:

Caution is required to avoid the risk of injustice;

A witness who is honest may be wrong even if they are convinced,

they are right;

A witness who is convincing may still be wrong;

More than one witness may be wrong;

A witness who recognizes the defendant, even when the witness

knows the defendant very well, may be wrong.

The identification of the Appellants solely rests on the evidence given by PW2

Lasanthika. According to her evidence, she had seen the Appellants

13

presence in their compound through a torn mackintosh. During that time,

no electricity was available in her village. Hence the villagers used Kerosine

oil lamp to generate light. According to her, she had used three Kerosine oil

lamps in her house on the day of the incident. After hearing the calling, this

witness had seen the 1st Appellant creeping into the house through the

window after tearing mackintosh. Further she had only seen the 1st Appellant

forcibly taking the deceased out from the side of the kitchen. Thereafter she

had come to the living hall area, gone near the window and witnessed all

three Appellants standing outside of the house. She had identified the

Appellants from the light which emanated from the bottle lamp. Thereafter

she had heard the cries of the deceased pleading not to harm him.

But in the cross examination she had said that she did not witness that the

deceased being taken out by the 1st Appellant. The relevant portion is re-

produced below:

Further it was brought to the notice of the court that PW2 had never stated

in her police statement that she saw the 1st Appellant taking away the

deceased out. This had been highlighted as omission by the defence.

Considering the evidence given by PW2 about the identity of the Appellants,

there are contradictions and omissions which certainly affect the outcome of

the decision.

14

The proof of contradiction is vital to destroy the credibility of the case of the

prosecution. Proven contradictions and omissions which can affect the case

of the prosecution plays a vital role in a criminal case.

PW2 is the most important witness in this case. The contradictions marked

in her evidence are vital and certainly affects her credibility. They also raise

doubts about the probability of the incident as described by the PW2. What

she told to the police and at the inquest needs to be considered carefully as

PW2 had fresh memory regarding the incident when she gave her statement

and evidence during the inquest. Failing to mention important facts which

result in the failure to accurately identify the accused certainly affects the

prosecution case. Hence, this ground also has merit.

In the final common ground, the Counsels contended that the infirmities in

the prosecution witnesses have not been adequately considered by Learned

Trial Judge.

PW2s omission in mentioning to the police that the 1st Appellant took the

deceased out affects her credibility in this case. This is a vital omission that

should not be considered lightly, as it certainly affects the conviction of the

1st Appellant.

The contradictions marked on the evidence of PW1 and PW2 are very material

which certainly affect the root of the case.

In the case of AG v. Sandanam Pitchai Mary Theresa (2011) 2 Sri L.R.

292 the court held that:

Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily

affect the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well

established that the Court must exercise its judgment on the

nature of the inconsistency or contradiction and should consider

whether they are material to the fact in issue.

15

In the case of K. Padmathilaka alias Sergeant Elpitiya v. The Director

General of Commission to Investigate Allegation of Bribery and

Corruption [2010] BLR 67 the court held that:

Credibility of prosecution witnesses should be subject to judicial

evaluation in totality and not isolated scrutiny by the judge. When

witness makes an inconsistent statement in their evidence either

at one stage or two stages, the testimony of such witness is

unreliableIt is a cardinal principle that unreliable evidence

cannot be rendered credible, simply because there is some

corroboration material.

The evidence of PW1 and PW2 to the incident creates serious doubt about

the identity of the Appellants. The contradictory positions taken by the

witnesses are vital and certainly goes to the root of the case and is sufficient

to create a reasonable doubt in the prosecutions case.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge had not correctly analyzed the

evidence presented by the prosecution. The conclusion reached by the

Learned High Court Judge that the evidence given by the prosecution

witnesses is convincing and trustworthy is a total misdirection. The Learned

High Court Judge had failed to consider evidence favorable to the Appellants.

In Kumara De Silva and 2 others v. Attorney General [2010] 2 SLR 169

the court held that:

Credibility is a question of fact, not of law The acceptance or

rejection of evidence of witnesses is therefore a question of fact

for the trial judge..

As the common grounds of appeal considered above which was jointly raised

by the Counsels for the Appellants are sufficient to affect the credibility of

prosecution case and certainly disturbs the judgment of the learned High

Court Judge, it is not necessary to address the remaining grounds raised by

the Counsels for the Appellants in this appeal.

16

Due to the aforesaid reasons, I set aside the conviction and the sentence

dated 14/07/2020 imposed on the Appellants by the learned High Court

Judge of Kalutara. Therefore, all the Appellants are acquitted from the

charge.

The Appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgement to

the High Court of Kalutara along with the original case record.
