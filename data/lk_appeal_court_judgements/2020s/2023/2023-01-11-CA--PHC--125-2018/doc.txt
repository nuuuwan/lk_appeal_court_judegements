Judgment

It appears that the Officer-in-Charge of the Miscellaneous Complaints Branch of the

Police Station of Gampola initiated proceedings in the Magistrate's Court of Gampola

on 03.09.2015 by filing an information under Section 66 (1) (a) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979. According to the said information, the 1st Respondent

had made complaints dated 20.08.2015 and 23.08.2015 against the 2nd Respondent

stating that the 2nd Respondent had uprooted the fence that existed along the access

to his land separating the land belonging to the 2nd Respondent and that three

concrete boundary posts were also removed altering the demarcation of boundaries

to effect construction.

The learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge, had taken up all

necessary steps stipulated in the Primary Courts Procedure Act and thereafter the

matter was fixed for inquiry.

According to the said information and sketch tendered to Court by the police, the

affidavits, counter-affidavits and the documents furnished by the Appellant, the

dispute is in respect of access to 1st Respondent-Respondent's land depicted in Plan

bearing No. 3262 prepared by S.M. Abeyratne, Licensed Surveyor, which is at page

131 of the Appeal Brief. The position of the 1st Respondent-Respondent was that a

fence separating the said access road from the Appellant's land existed.

After both parties filed written submissions, the learned Primary Court Judge of

Gampola in the Order dated 01.06.2016 had determined that subject matter of the

case is the access road depicted as Lot 9 in Plan bearing No. 3262 dated 12.09.2000

prepared by S. M. Abeyratne, Licensed Surveyor; and a fence thereof.

It was further held that the 2nd Respondent removed the fence that existed up to

the 2nd Respondents land along the said access. Hence, the learned Judge of the

Primary Court had ordered that the boundaries of the access road concerned ought

to remain as it was situated. Further, the 2nd Respondent was ordered not to alter

the access road in question.

The report filed by the Registrar/Deputy Fiscal of the Court demonstrates that the

Order of the Primary Court was executed on 11.07.2016 by restoring the fence so

uprooted/removed by the Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said Order dated 01.06.2016 of the learned Primary Court

Judge of Gampola, the 2nd Respondent-Petitioner had invoked the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Central Province holden at Kandy by

her application dated 30.08.2016, seeking to set aside the said Order.

It appears that the 1st Respondent-Respondent had filed Statement of Objections

and affidavit dated 08.02.2017 in the Provincial High Court to show that the width

of the access road that had been used over a period of time; had been 4 feet and 3

inches on the ground.

The Appellant, in her Counter Affidavit dated 22.03.2017 contended that the said

access road became about 6 feet wide when the impugned Order of the learned

Primary Court Judge was executed.

However, after the conclusion of the inquiry, the learned Judge of the Provincial

High Court by Order/Judgment dated 10.07.2018 refused the application in revision

of the Petitioner-Appellant on the premise that the Petitioner-Appellant had not

disclosed reasons sufficient enough warranting to revise the Order of the learned

Primary Court Judge and further, that an alternative remedy was available to the

Petitioner-Appellant to resolve the matter.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Petitioner-Appellant had preferred an appeal

to this Court seeking to revise or set aside the Order made by the learned High Court

Judge as well as the learned Primary Court Judge. It is seen that the real dispute in

the instant case is as to the width of the access to the 1st Respondent-Respondent's

land.

The learned Primary Court Judge had ordered

.

It is imperative to note that the dispute between the parties is over the width of an

access road to the Respondents property. According to deed bearing No. 3580 [X5]

and plan bearing No. 3262, it indicates the width of the access road as only 3 feet.

However, the investigation officer had observed and mentioned in the investigation

notes that the width of the disputed access road situated on earth is only 4 feet

wide, bordering the Appellants land. Thus, it is prima facie evident that the

Respondent had been using this 4 feet wide roadway to access her land.

The learned Magistrate had stated in her Order that;

.

.

.

In view of the Magistrates Order, the learned Magistrate had come to a correct

finding of fact and law and determined the matter in terms of Section 69 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act, although the said Section is not mentioned in the

Page 5 of 5

Order. As such, the learned Magistrate had correctly ordered to have the boundaries

of the access roadway as before, prior to the dispute between parties arose.

Therefore, it clearly shows that the learned Magistrate had made the Order on the

assumption that the 1st Respondent-Respondent is entitled to use the disputed road

to her land.

It is relevant to note that the impugned Order of the Magistrate was executed on

11.07.2016. The learned Magistrate in her Order dated 01.06.2016 had directed

parties to adjudicate the matter in a civil forum. However, it was not disclosed by

either party that a civil case had been instituted in respect of the impugned dispute

in this matter.

The revisionary jurisdiction can be exercised if there is no other remedy available.

Since the Petitioner-Appellant had not resorted to the available remedy, revision is

not available to the Petitioner-Appellant.

Therefore, in view of the aforesaid reasons, it is observable that there is no

miscarriage of justice or any injustice caused to the Petitioner-Appellant to invoke

the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court. Moreover, the Petitioner-

Appellant had not disclosed that exceptional circumstances warrant to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court.

As such, the learned High Court Judge had dismissed the revision application of the

Petitioner-Appellant. Thus, we see no reason to interfere with the Order dated

10.07.2018 of the learned High Court Judge and the Order dated 01.06.2016 of the

learned Magistrate.

Hence, the appeal is dismissed with tax cost.
