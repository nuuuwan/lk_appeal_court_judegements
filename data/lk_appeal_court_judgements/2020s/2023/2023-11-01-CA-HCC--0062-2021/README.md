P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted by the Attorney General for

following offences:

1. For committing an offence of Grave Sexual Abuse on Kavindu

Chinthaka Congreve between the period of 01.01.2016 and

31.01.2016 an offence punishable under Section 365 B (2) (b) of the

Penal Code.

lawfull guardianship an offence punishable under Section 354 of the

Penal Code.

3. During the same time period committing an offence of Grave Sexual

Abuse on Kavindu Chinthaka Congreve an offence punishable under

Section 365 B (2) (b) of the Penal Code.

The trial commenced on 20/08/2020. After leading all necessary witnesses,

the prosecution closed the case. The Learned High Court Judge had called

for the defence and the Appellant opted to testify under oaths.

3 | P a g e

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the evidence presented by

both parties, convicted the Appellant for the 1st Count and sentenced the

Appellant to 11 years of rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of

Rs.20000/- subject to a default sentence of 04 months simple imprisonment.

In addition, a compensation of Rs.100000/- was ordered with a default

sentence of 06 months simple imprisonment.

Further, the Appellant was acquitted from 2nd and 3rd Counts by the Court.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. During the trial he was connected via zoom from the prison.

Even though on perusal of the Written Submissions of the Appellant, it

appears no specific grounds of appeal had been urged. But at the hearing

following Grounds of Appeal are raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. Whether the Learned High Court Judge considered the credibility of

the evidence of the victim properly.

2. Whether the Learned High Court Judge considered the medical

evidence and the evidence of victims mother properly.

3. Whether prosecution led evidence as to how the complaint was

instituted.

4. Whether the Learned High Court Judge considered the evidence of the

Appellant properly.

4 | P a g e

The Facts of this case albeit briefly are as follows:

According to PW1, the victim of this case, he was about 11 years old when

he had undergone this ordeal. The Appellant, who is well known him and his

family, had taken the victim to his sisters house on the pretext of having to

feed the fish. The victim was taken in a push-bicycle and having arrived at

the house of the Appellants sisters house, he was taken inside. Thereafter,

the victim was taken into a room and having got the victim to lie on the bed,

and removed his clothes, the Appellant committed a sexual act between his

thighs (Intra-crural).

After the act, he was brought back and dropped him closed to his house.

Before the Appellant departed, he had threatened the witness not to divulge

this incident to anybody. Due to fear he had not divulged this to his mother,

but it had come to light in the school and then he was questioned by police,

where he disclosed the incident.

PW2, the mother of victim testified that she came to know about the incident

from school and thereafter made a statement to the police.

PW3, JMO who examined the victim on 03.02.2016 had opined that even

though no injuries observed on the victims body he could not exclude intra-

crural act committed on the victim.

According to PW7, the police officer who had conducted the investigation

stated that the investigation was commenced upon receiving a telephone

message through children assistance toll free No.1929. Thereafter, he had

recorded the statement from the victim and arrested the Appellant.

The Appellant in his evidence admitted that he had taken the victim on

31.01.2016 to his sisters house to feed fish but denied that he committed

any sexual abuse on the child.

5 | P a g e

In the first ground of Appeal the Appellant contends that whether the

Learned High Court Judge considered the credibility of the evidence of the

victim properly.

In a case of this nature, the testimonial trustworthiness and credibility of

PW1, mainly probability should be assessed with utmost care and caution

by the trial judge. The learned Trial Judge has to satisfy and accept the

evidence of a child witness after assessing his competence and credibility as

a witness. Hence, before analysing the grounds of appeal advanced in this

case, I consider it of utmost importance that the following authorities from

other jurisdictions on the topic be appraised.

It was recognized in England as early as 1778 that children could be

competent witnesses in criminal trials.

In R v. Brasier168 Eng. Rep.202 [1779] the court held:

.that an infant, though underage of seven years, may be sworn in

a criminal prosecution, provided such infant appears, on strict

examination by the Court, to possess a sufficient knowledge of the

nature and consequences of an oath for there is no precise or fixed

rule as to the time within which infants are excluded from giving

evidence; but their admissibility depends upon the sense and reason

they entertain of the danger and impiety of falsehood, which is to be

collected from their answers to questions propounded to them by the

Court; but if they are found incompetent to take oath, their testimony

cannot be received ..

6 | P a g e

In Ratansinh Dalsukhbhai Nayak v. State of Gujarat [2004] 1 SCC 64 the

court held that:

The decision on the question whether the child witness has sufficient

intelligence primarily rests with the trial Judge who notices his manners,

his apparent possession or lack of intelligence, and said Judge may

resort to any examination which will tend to disclose his capacity and

intelligence as well as his understanding of the obligation of an oath.

The decision of the trial court may, however, be disturbed by the higher

Court if from what is preserved in the records, it is clear his conclusion

was erroneous. This precaution is necessary because child witnesses

are amenable to tutoring and often live in a world of make beliefs.

Though it is an established principle that child witnesses are dangerous

witnesses as they are pliable and liable to be influenced easily, shaked

and moulded, but it is also an accepted norm that if after careful scrutiny

of their evidence the Court comes to the conclusion that there is an

impress of truth in it, there is no obstacle in the way of accepting the

evidence of a child witness.

In Ranjeet Kumar Ram v. State of Bihar [2015] SCC Online SC 500 the

court held that:

Evidence of the child witness and its credibility would depend upon the

circumstances of each case. Only precaution which the court has to bear

in mind while assessing the evidence of a child witness is that the

witness must be a reliable one.

7 | P a g e

E.R.S.R Coomaraswamy in his Law of Evidence Volume 2 Book 2 at page

658 has stated referring to child witness;

There is no requirement in English law, that the sworn evidence of a

child witness needs to be corroborated as a matter of law. But the jury

should be warned, not to look for corroboration, but of the risks involved

in acting on the sole evidence of young girls and boys, though they may

do so if convinced of the truth of such evidence.This requirement is

based on the susceptibility of children to the influence of others and to

the surrender to their imaginations.

At page 659 it states As regards the sworn testimony of children, there

is no requirement as in England to warn of the risk involved in acting on

their sole testimony, though it may desirable to issue such a warning,

though the failure to do so will generally not affect the conviction.

The victim was 15 years old when he gave evidence before the court. The

Learned High Court Judge in her judgment very correctly and

comprehensively considered the evidence given by the victim.

Further the Learned High Court Judge had considered contradictions

marked by the defence, and she had given plausible reasons as to why she

disregards those contradictions. The relevant portions of the judgment is re-

produced below:

Justice Thakkar in Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v State of Gujarat

1983 AIR SC 753 stated:

By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video

tape is replayed on the mental screen.

9 | P a g e

Hence, the learned High Court Judge has very correctly held that the

contradictions which do not go to the root of the case has no bearing on the

outcome of main case.

Learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence of the victim fairly

and squarely by analysing the demeanour of the witness adequately to decide

this case. Hence, no substantial rights of the Appellant had been prejudiced.

Therefore, this ground has no merit.

In the second ground of appeal, the Appellant contents that whether the

Learned High Court Judge considered the medical evidence and the evidence

of victims mother properly.

In her judgment, the Learned High Court Judge had adequately considered

the medical evidence to arrive at her decision. Hence, it is incorrect to state

that the Learned High Court Judge had not considered the medical evidence

properly. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

Page 196 of the brief.

Next, the Learned High Court Judge had very correctly stated that the

victims evidence is not corroborated by mothers evidence, as the victims

mother only came to about the incident when she was called to the police.

The relevant portion is re-produced below:

Page 196 of the brief.

Therefore, the matters raised in second ground has no merit at all.

In the third ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that whether the

prosecution led evidence as to how the complaint was instituted.

The prosecution had led evidence that the victims mother only came to know

the incident from the police. The victim in his evidence said that he has not

informed the incident to his mother due to fear engulfed over the Appellant.

This has been very well considered by the Learned High Court Judge in her

judgment. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

Page 200 of the brief.

11 | P a g e

Further, how the incident was reported has been very correctly considered

in the judgement by the Learned High Court Judge. In this case, the incident

has directly reported to police under toll free children help desk No.1929.The

investigation was sparked off upon receiving this information. This too has

been correctly considered by the Learned High Court in her judgment. The

relevant portion is re-produced below:

Page 189 of the brief.

This appeal ground too has no merit as there is no discrepancy to be noted

regarding the reporting of the incident to relevant authority.

In the final ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that whether the

Learned High Court Judge considered the evidence of the Appellant properly.

The Learned High Court Judge had properly considered the evidence given

by the Appellant in her judgement. The Appellant had not denied that he

took the victim to his sisters place to feed the fish. This position had been

considered along with the defence taken by the Appellant. The relevant

portion is re-produced below:

Page 190 of the brief.

Due to aforesaid reasons, the Appellant is not successful under this ground

of appeal as well.

In this case, the victim had given firm evidence as to the atrocities committed

on him by the Appellant. Even though the incident had happened when the

victim was at a tender age, he had given evidence without any major

contradictions.

Considering the evidence led in this case, I conclude that this is not an

appropriate case in which to interfere with the judgement delivered by the

Learned High Court Judge on 04/08/2021 against the Appellant. I therefore,

dismiss the appeal.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Embilipitiya along with the original case record.
