Before : Hon . Justice Menaka Wijesundera,

Hon. Justice B. Sasi Mahendran,

Counsel : Anil Silva P.C with U.S. Neranga for the Accused Appellant.

Janaka Bandara D.S.G with S.N. Sabry for the Complainant-

Respondent.

Decided on: 05.07.2023.

Hon. Justice Menaka Wijesundera,

Accused Appellants are on bail.

When the matter was taken up for argument the learned Presidents Counsel submitted that

he is not contesting the conviction but only the sentence.

Submissions of both parties concluded. Upon considering the submissions, the learned

Presidents Counsel submitted that his position put forward during the trial has not been

fully considered by the trial Judge.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General brought to the notice of this Court that if the

remorsefulness displayed by the Accused - Appellants right now had been displayed at the

very beginning of the trial, it would have saved the valuable time of Court and the valuable

time of Counsel and all parties. But he had no objection for the application of the counsel

for the Accused Appellant.

In this matter we observe that the incident had taken place in 2013 and the trial had

concluded in 2018. Therefore, from the date of incident 10 years have lapsed. This Court

also notes that if the remorsefulness expressed by the Accused Appellants at this stage

had been expressed at the time when the trial was taken up, the long process of a trial

3

could have been avoided and it would have saved the time of the Judge, the Counsel and all

parties. Nevertheless having considered submissions of all parties, this Court is of the view

that since both the Accused Appellants are first time offenders and the time duration, since

the date of offence and the conclusion of the trial that the sentences imposed on the

Accused Appellants should be reviewed.

As such, the sentence imposed on the 1st Accused Appellant for the 1st count is reduced to

one year imprisonment and for the 2nd count also the same. Both these terms of

imprisonments are suspended for 10 years. The terms of imprisonments of the 2nd Accused

Appellant is also reviewed and for the 5th charge the term of imprisonment period is

reduced to one year, and for the 6th charge also the same and both terms of imprisonments

are suspended for 10 years. The rest of the sentence imposed on both Accused Appellants

to remain the same.

Subject to the said variation, the instant appeal is dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL.

Hon. Justice B. Sasi Mahendran,

I agree.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL.
