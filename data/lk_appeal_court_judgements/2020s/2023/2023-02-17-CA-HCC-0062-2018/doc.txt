JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo under Sections 54(A) (d) and 54(A) (b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for the

possession and the trafficking of 18.24 grams of Heroin (diacetylmorphine)

on 09th August 2010.

After the trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the learned

High Court Judge of Colombo has sentenced him to death for each count on

03/01/2018.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. During the argument he has been connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. The Learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider that

both inter se and per se contradictions between the evidence of PW1

and PW2 which create a reasonable doubt and thereby the conviction

is unsafe.

3 | P a g e

2. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to analyse the improbability of the

prosecution version of the case and thereby conviction is unsafe.

Background of the case.

In this case the raid was conducted upon the receipt of specific information

by PW1. The raid was conducted by a team of police officers from the Police

Narcotics Bureau headed by PW1. All members of the team had been named

as witnesses in the indictment including the Government Analyst. The

prosecution had called PW1, PW2 and PW8 Government Analyst and closed

the case. The prosecution had marked productions P1(1-7) and P2-P8 during

the trial.

When the defence was called, the Appellant had made a dock statement and

closed the case.

On 09/08/2010 PW1, IP/Rangajeewa attached to the Police Narcotics

Bureau had received an information about the trafficking of Heroin by a

person called Nisham. The informant had revealed that the Appellant would

start of selling Heroin on that day at a place called Sinna Dupatha which

is situated between Borella Megazine Road and Wanathamulla area. Acting

on that information PW1 had arranged a team comprising 07 officers

attached to the Police Narcotics Bureau and left the police station at 10:15

hours. Before the departure, all the officers who had been selected for the

raid were fully searched by PW1 to confirm that the said officers were not

carrying any illegal substance with them. The team had left the police station

in a van bearing No. HE-2306. Also notified his superior officer about this

intended raid.

Going according to the information received, they had left the Police

Narcotics Bureau and proceeded towards Rajagiriya. While they were in the

vehicle for about 1 hour and 50 minutes, PW1 had received another call from

the informant and he had informed that the Appellant had started to sell

Heroin in the house of a lady called Jayanthi. Also informed that the Jayanthi

4 | P a g e

was spying. Thereafter, the team went towards the Serpentine Flats in their

vehicle stopped few meters before the Serpentine Flats. Only PW1 and PW2

had alighted from the vehicle, crossed the railway road and entered the

house of Jayathi. As PW1 knew Jayanthis house previously, he directly

entered her house without any difficulty. At there, he had seen the Appellant

sitting on a chair and Jayanthi standing next to him. After a struggle, the

Appellant was searched and found a cellophane cover from right side pocket

of the Appellants pair of shorts. When he removed the cover, some brown

coloured substance was found inside the parcel. As it reacted for Heroin the

Appellant was arrested immediately. Cash Rs.28,300/- was also recovered

from the Appellant. Jayanthi was also arrested on the charge of aiding and

abetting the Appellant. Nothing found in the house or in the custody of

Jayanthi.

The Appellant and Jayanthi were brought to the Police Narcotics Bureau

thereafter. The substance weighed in the presence of the Appellant at the

Police Narcotics Bureau. The parcel had contained 44 grams of substance.

Thereafter the productions had been sealed in the presence of the Appellant.

After entering notes, PW1 had handed over the productions and the

Appellant to the reserve police officer SI/Samarakoon. The Heroin parcel was

entered under production No.89/10 and the money recovered from the

Appellant was entered under production No.90/10.

PW2, SI/Chandana Prasad had given evidence to corroborate the evidence of

PW1.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person and this burden never

shifts. Hence an accused person has no burden to prove his innocents unless

he pleads a general or a special exception in the Penal Code.

5 | P a g e

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:

the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required

in a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree

is well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree

of probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof

beyond the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the

community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of

justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a

remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the

sentence, of course it is possible, but not in the least probable, the case

is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will

suffice.

As the first and second grounds of the appeal are interconnected, the said

grounds will be considered together in this appeal. In the first ground of

appeal the Appellant contends that the Learned High Court Judge erred in

law by failing to consider that both inter se and per se contradictions between

the evidence of PW1 and PW2 which create a reasonable doubt and thereby

the conviction is unsafe and in the second ground he further contends that

the Learned Trial Judge has failed to analyse the improbability of the

prosecution version of the case and thereby conviction is unsafe.

According to PW1, the team consisted 08 officers including him and all had

been individually checked by PW1 to confirm that they were not carrying any

substance. (Page 80 of the brief.)

According to PW2, 09 police officers had participated in the raid. (Page 161

of the brief.)

This discrepancy cannot be a result of lack of observation or defective

memory as the police officers are required to put entries in the information

book at the end of each and every raid they conduct.

6 | P a g e

In describing the dress, PW1 told court that the Appellant was wearing a

green coloured long pair of shorts and a butter-coloured T-shirt at the time

of his arrest. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

The above highlighted portions of evidence of PW1 and PW2 cannot be

considered as trivial contradictions. The inter se and per se contradictions

highlighted are strong challenge to the prosecution version. They certainly

attack the root of the matter very strongly.

In the book Sarkar on Evidence, 15th Edition at page 112 states:

Minor discrepancies are possible, even in the version of truthful

witnesses and such minor discrepancies only add to the truthfulness of

their evidence. [Sidhan v. State of Kerela [1986] Cri LJ 470,

473(Kerala)]. But discrepancies in the statements of witnesses on

material points should not be passed over, as they seriously affect the

value of their testimony (Brijlal v.Kunwar, 36A 187: 18CWN 649:

A1914PC38).The main thing to be seen in whether the inconsistencies

go to the root of the matter or pertain to insignificant aspects thereof. In

the former case, the defence may be justified in seeking advantage of the

incongruities obtaining in the evidence. In the latter, however, no such

benefit will be available to it. (Krishna Pillai Sree Kumar v. State of

Kerala A [1981] SC 1237,1239).

In The Attorney General v.Sandanam Pitchai Mary Theresa [2011] 2 SLR

292 the court held that:

Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect

the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that

the Court must exercise its judgment on the nature of the inconsistency

or contradiction and whether they are true material to the facts in issue.

In all detection cases the police detectives maintain records. When they are

call upon by the prosecution to testify in court, they are allowed to use their

notes to refresh their memory. Hence, their evidence cannot consist inter se

or per se contradictions as they give systematic evidence regarding the

11 | P a g e

particular incident. If their evidence consists inter se or per se contradictions

and which affects the root of the case, their credibility become questionable.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment at pages 265-266 held that

the evidence given by PW1 and PW2 sans any contradiction in their evidence.

The relevant portion is re-produced below:

(Pages 265-266 of the brief.)

The above highlighted portion in the judgment is a clear indication that the

Learned High Court had not considered and analysed the evidence given by

PW1 and PW2 properly.

According to PW1, he had received a specific information that a person called

Himash and a lady called Jayanthi were involved in selling drugs at a place

called Sinna Dupatha.

But PW2, in his evidence categorically said that he was unaware about the

identity of the persons until he was directed to enter Jayanthis house.

Hence, the Counsel submits that this leads to serious doubt about the

happening of the incident as described by the witnesses.

Next the Counsel argued that although a specific information had been

received about involvement of a female called Jayanthi, PW1 had failed to

include a female police officer to the team. Hence, she further argues that

the incident described by PW1 and PW2 fail the test of probability.

Probability test is a prerequisite in criminal trials to prove the case beyond

reasonable doubt. In this case the conduct of PW1 is highly questionable

which certainly not pass the probability test.

12 | P a g e

In this case PW1and PW2 are the key witnesses and experienced police

officers. Their evidence is not clear and not matched on material points

discussed above. Their evidence is tainted with much ambiguity and

uncertainty which definitely affects the root of the case. Hence, the appeal

grounds advanced by the Appellant have very serious impact on the

prosecution case.

Taking into consideration, all these circumstances, I am of the view that the

conviction of the Appellant cannot be allowed to stand as the prosecution

had failed its duty to prove this case beyond reasonable doubt. I set aside

the conviction and sentence imposed by the Learned High Court Judge of

Colombo dated 03/01/2018 on the Appellant. Therefore, he is acquitted from

this case.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
