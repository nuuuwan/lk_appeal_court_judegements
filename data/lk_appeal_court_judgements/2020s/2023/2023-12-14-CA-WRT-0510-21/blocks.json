The Petitioner's appointment to the post of Registrar was permanent and was subject to a probation period of one year.

After considering the findings of the said audit query, at the 500th council meeting of the University held on 03.01.2021 Council of the University decided to hold a preliminary investigation as per Clause 8.1.1. of Chapter XXII of the Establishment Code of the University Grant Commission (UGC) and send the Petitioner on compulsory leave with effect from 04.01.2021 as per Clause 18.7 of Chapter XXII of the above Code.

Since Section 1:4 of Chapter XXII of the Code does not make a distinction in respect of the applicability of provisions, including said Section 8:2 of Chapter XXII of the Code, to the probationary employees, it is apparent that a charge sheet should be issued in case where a prima facie case of improper conduct of a probationer is revealed at the respective preliminary investigation. Hence, the argument of the Respondents that there is no legal requirement to hold a formal disciplinary inquiry for probationers under the provisions of the Establishment Code of the University has no merit. In the instant case, a preliminary investigation was held against the Petitioner and a decision was taken to hold a formal disciplinary inquiry against the Petitioner based on his improper conduct.",

Hence, when it comes to the termination of a probationer on improper conduct or disciplinary grounds, I hold the view that the disciplinary authority should conduct a formal disciplinary inquiry if the preliminary investigation discloses a prima facie case before termination of services.",
