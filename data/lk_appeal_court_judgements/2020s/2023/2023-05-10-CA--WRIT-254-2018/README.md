The petitioner has filed this application for Writ of Certiorari and Mandamus with

regard to the order delivered on 08/02/2018 by the Administrative Appeal

Tribunal (hereinafter the AAT). A copy of the said determination No-

AAT/184/2013 (SPC) made by the respondents has been produced marked as

P36, claiming that the order is erroneous in nature.

The facts relevant to the application, according to the petitioner, are briefly as

follows. The petitioner B. Sivapiragasam was born on 23/02/1954 and retired on

23/02/2014 at the age of 60 years. The petitioner joined the Public Service as a

graduate trainee on 01/03/1990 and was appointed to a post of Plan

Implementation Officer (PIO) on 01/04/1992. Thereafter, he was appointed to a

post of Project Officer in the North and East Province with effect from

01/01/1997.

Later he was absorbed (appointed) into the Sri Lanka Planning Service (SLPS)

and appointed as Assistant Director Class II Grade II with effect from

01/09/1999 subject to a 1-year probationary period (appointment letter P2 dated

02/08/2000). Paragraph 13 of P2 states that the initial salary scale attached to

the post of the petitioner is Rs. 97,500/- with 15 increments enabling the

petitioner to receive a maximum sum of Rs.138,000/-. The appointment letter

further stated that the salary step for the 1st efficiency bar examination is Rs.

102,900/- while the salary step for 2nd efficiency bar examination is Rs.119,100/-

.

The above-mentioned salary scales are validated through P3, the Service Minutes

of the SLPS. Section 3:1 of the minutes on the SLPS published in the gazette

extraordinary bearing No.1134/5 dated 30/05/2000 which state that Class II

Grade II employees are entitled to an initial salary scale of Rs. 97,500/- with 15

x Rs. 2,700/- increments enabling the employee to receive a maximum salary of

4

CA-WRIT-254-2018 Page 4 of 12 10/05/2023 IJ-20-23

Rs.138,000/-. It is also stated that the salary step for the 1st efficiency bar

examination is before Rs. 102,900/- and the salary step for 2nd efficiency bar

examination is before Rs.119,100/-.

Nevertheless, P3a Section 8:3:2 of the minutes on the SLPS published in the

gazette extraordinary bearing No.1134/5 dated 30/05/2000 stated:

An Officer in Class II Grade II will be exempted from the requirement of passing

the prescribed Efficiency Bar Examination for promotion over the Efficiency Bar on

completing the age of 45 years.

Furthermore, the petitioner is informed through a letter P4 dated 27/09/2002

by the Secretary of SLPS Board that subject to the SLPS minute and the Public

Administration Circular (PAC) No: 20/2001 that he is exempted from the 1st

Efficiency Bar Examination.

Considering both the P3a & P4 the petitioner claimed to state that, he is entitled

to this exemption of the efficiency bar examination.

The Secretary of SLPS Board requested the Chief Secretary of Northern-Eastern

Provinces (NEP) through a letter P5 dated 21/07/2004 an inspection on all public

service officer in the category Class II Grade II to access whether they have

successfully completed their required efficiency bar examinations for the

promotion. Subsequently through the letter P6 dated 09/09/2004 Deputy Chief

Secretary Planning confirms to the Secretary of Provincial Public Administration

of NEP that the petitioner in this present application has been absorbed as to

SLPS II/II from 01/09/1999 and is exempted from the 1st Efficiency Bar as per

the SLPS board letter dated 27/09/2002.

Nevertheless, through a letter P7 dated 28/11/2005 the Secretary of SLPS Board

informed that public service officer of Class II Grade II B. Sivapiragasam

(petitioner) is required to sit for the Efficiency Bar Examination. Thus, this letter

indicates that the petitioner is not entitled to the exemption. As a response the

petitioner sends a request letter P8 dated 29/06/2006 to the Secretary of SLPS

and others pleading to be exempted from sitting for the 1st Efficiency Bar

5

CA-WRIT-254-2018 Page 5 of 12 10/05/2023 IJ-20-23

Examination claiming on the exemption grounds 8:3:2 of the minutes on the

SLPS published in the gazette extraordinary bearing No.1134/5 dated

30/05/2000 and PAC No: 20/2001. However, the request appeal was not

accepted and thereby through a letter P9 Director General of SLPS Board informs

the Chief Secretary of NEP to abide by P7 letter notifying that the petitioner is

not entitled for any exemption.

Through a letter P11 dated 05/04/2007 by the Assistant Director of SLPS Board

to the Chief Secretary of Northern- Eastern Provinces it was aimed to clarify the

salary scale of the petitioner, B. Sivapiragasam. Later, the Assistant Director of

SLPS Board further through a letter (P13) dated 30/01/2008 informed the Chief

Secretary of NEP that B. Sivapiragasam is not entitled to the exemption of the

Efficiency Bar Examination.

Subsequently, on 19/08/2008 the petitioner B. Sivapiragasam addressed a

detailed appeal letter P14 to the Director General of Establishments of the

Ministry of Public Administration through the Deputy Chief Secretary of

Administration Eastern Province through the Deputy Chief Secretary of

Provincial Planning Secretariat of Eastern Province, explaining the grounds on

which the petitioner claims for the prescribed exemption of the Efficiency Bar

Examination.

The letter elaborated that the petitioner was appointed to the SLPS II/II with

effect from 01/09/1999 and the salary scale applicable to the post was indicated

as Rs. 97,500/- with 15 x Rs. 2700/- increments resulting in a maximum salary

scale of Rs.138,000/-. It also stated that an officer must pass the 1st Efficiency

Bar Examination before 3rd step of Rs. 102,900/- and 2nd Efficiency Bar before

9th step of Rs. 119,100/-. (For easy reference the salary scale and dates are

mentioned below)

1. Rs. 97,500/- on 01/09/1999

2. Rs. 100,200/- on 01/09/2000

3. Rs. 102,900/- 1st Efficiency Bar Exam on 01/09/2001

4. Rs.105,600/-

6

CA-WRIT-254-2018 Page 6 of 12 10/05/2023 IJ-20-23

5. Rs. 108,300/-

6. Rs. 111,000/-

7. Rs. 113,700/-

8. Rs. 116,400/-

9. Rs. 119,100/- 2nd Efficiency Bar Exam on 01/09/2007

The letter also further elaborated that section 2 of the PAC No: 20/2001 of 12th

September 2001 states Officers serving in posts in which the scheme recruitment

or the service minutes presently having provisions to exempt from passing the

Efficiency Bars on completing 45 years of age, such officers shall be exempted from

the Efficiency Bars provided they complete 45 years if age prior to the date of the

implementation of this circular. (Date of implementation of PAC 20/2001

01/10/2001).

Thereby the petitioner submitted his claims stating that he has completed the

age of 45 years on 23/02/1999, reached the Efficiency Bar on 01/09/2001 and

stated that both dates (23/02/1999 & 01/09/2001) are prior to the date of

implementation of the PAC No:20/2001 (01/10/2001) and thus is entitled to the

said exemption with effect from 01/09/2001.

Through the letter P15 dated 01/09/2008 the Chief Secretary of Eastern

Province forwarded the appeal request of the petitioner to the Director General of

Establishments, Ministry of Public Administration requesting consideration on

P14.

With reference to P15 Director General of Establishment informs the Chief

Secretary of Eastern Province through the letter P16 dated 17/10/2008 that the

officers of SLPS II/II would only be eligible for the exemption if they fulfill the

requirements of completing 45 years of age and reaching the Efficiency Bar salary

step prior to 01/10/2001 which is the date of implementation the PAC 20/2001.

The letter P17 dated 11/11/2008 by the Deputy Chief Secretary of Eastern

Province to the Secretary of Ministry of Finance and Planning responded stating

that according P16 the officers are eligible for the said exemption as they have

fulfilled both requirements of completing 45 years of age and reaching the

7

CA-WRIT-254-2018 Page 7 of 12 10/05/2023 IJ-20-23

Efficiency Bar salary step before 01/10/2001. Thereby the Deputy Chief

Secretary of Eastern Province recommended that petitioner is entitled to the

claimed exemption.

Nevertheless, through a letter P19 dated 15/07/2009 the Ministry of Finance

and Planning informed the Chief Secretary of Eastern Province that B.

Sivapiragasam , the petitioner is not entitled to the said exemption as they are

bound by the letter P13 of the Assistant Director SLPS dated 30/01/2008 which

annunciated the order of the Public Service Commission.

However, the petitioner had made an appeal P35 against the decision of the

Public Service Commission, along with which a list of annexures marked A1

A37 were submitted to the AAT for consideration. The annexed documents are

similar to the documents annexed in the instant application. Upon consideration

of all facts and documentations, the order P36 by the AAT was delivered on

08/02/2018 stating the appeal was dismissed on the ground that Although the

appellant had completed 45 years of age before 01/10/2001, he would be reaching

the E.B. salary point on 26/02/2003, that was a later date than the effective date

of the P.A. Circular No: 20/2001 of 13/09/2001. Yet, it could be stated that

the AAT has not correctly scrutinized the documents when delivering the order

as it is challenged to be erroneous in nature.

Prior to determining whether the order by the AAT is erroneous in nature it is

essential to establish whether the petitioner has successfully fulfilled the 2

requirements for the exemption. The requirements are:

1. Completing the age of 45 years &

2. Reaching the Efficiency Bar salary step prior to 01/10/2001

Thereby if the petitioner fulfills both requirements it is a legitimate expectation

that he is entitled to the exemptions.

8

CA-WRIT-254-2018 Page 8 of 12 10/05/2023 IJ-20-23

- Age Requirement

Section 8:3:2 of the Service Minutes on the SLPS published in the gazette

extraordinary bearing No.1134/5 dated 30/05/2000 indicates:

An Officer in Class II Grade II will be exempted from the requirement of passing

the prescribed Efficiency Bar Examination for promotion over the Efficiency Bar on

completing the age of 45 years.

As cited and annexed through P1 (Birth Certificate) it is proved that the

petitioner, B. Sivapiragasam was born on 23/02/1954 and thereby reaches the

age 45 years on 23/02/1999. This thereby fulfills the 1st requirement for the

exemption as the petitioner reaches the age 45 years prior to 01/10/2001 which

the date of implementation of the PAC 20/2001.

- Salary Step Requirement

Secondly for the public officer to be exempted from the said exemption it is

necessary to prove that the petitioner reached the required Efficiency Bar salary

step prior to 01/10/2001.

The annexed documents affirm the petitioner had joined the Public Service as a

graduate trainee on 01/03/1990 and later upon a cabinet decision the petitioner

was absorbed (appointed) to SLPS II/II with effect from 01/09/1999. Further in

paragraph 13 of P2/ (P2a) it states that the initial salary scale attached to the

post of the petitioner is Rs. 97,500/- with 15 increments enabling the petitioner

to receive a maximum sum of Rs.138,000/-. The letter further stated that the

salary step for the 1st efficiency bar examination is Rs. 102,900/-. Nevertheless,

as per P12 the letter confirming the service of the petitioner, point 2 stated

Salary step entitled and paid at the time of absorption into SLPS II/II is Rs.

105,600/- pa.

Thereby it is evident that the salary step paid to the petitioner at the initial stage

of absorption to the position of SLPS II/II is Rs. 105,600 and thus is higher than

the expected level of Rs. 102,600/-. Hence, it is apparent that the petitioner has

undoubtedly reached the required salary step prior to 01/10/2001.

9

CA-WRIT-254-2018 Page 9 of 12 10/05/2023 IJ-20-23

Additionally, the Establishment Code of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka Chapter VII: Clause 5 Salary on Promotion sets out the rules to adhere

when converting the salary scales of officers promoted to new positions.

5:3 If the salary of the post to which an officer is promoted has an

incremental salary scale, his salary should be converted from one

scale to the other in accordance with the following rules.

5:4 If on promotion, the last salary drawn by an officer falls

between salary step of the new scale, he will be placed on the higher

step and also be given an additional increment.

5:5 If on promotion, the last salary drawn by an officer corresponds

to the initial or a step on the new scale, he will be placed on the next

higher step.

5:6 - If on promotion, the last salary drawn by an officer is less than

one incremental step or more below the initial salary, he will be

placed on the initial of the new scale.

It is apparent that the petitioner has fulfilled both requirements stated in Section

8:3:2 of the Service Minutes on the SLPS published in the gazette extraordinary

bearing No.1134/5 and Public Administration Circular 20/2001 which amends

the Section 15 of Chapter II of the Establishment Code, by completing 45 years

of age and reaching the Efficiency Bar salary step prior to 01/10/2001 which is

the date of implementation the PAC 20/2001 and is thereby legitimately eligible

for the said exemption from the Efficiency Bar Examination.

The AAT order cited the Supreme Court FR Application No: 432/2003 dated

04/05/2006 claiming as a case decided on a similar matter which focused on the

eligibility of the public officers to the exemption from the Efficiency Bar

Examination. Her Ladyship Justice Shirani Bandaranayake in the said judgment

further reiterated that in order, for the petitioner to be entitled to concessions

granted, it is necessary to fulfill two specific requirements. Which were:

10

CA-WRIT-254-2018 Page 10 of 12 10/05/2023 IJ-20-23

1. The petitioner has reached the age of 45 years &

2. Reached the required salary step at the time he applied for the concessions

prior to the implementation of PAC 20/2001.

Nevertheless, in the said FR matter though the petitioner reached the age of 45

years prior to the implementation date of PAC 20/2001, he had not reached the

required salary step and thereby was denied access to the said exemption.

The learned DSG during the argument stage of the instant case enunciated and

cited the No: 432/2003 FR case (Supra) and the PAC 20/2001 while agreeing

that it is essential that the petitioner must fulfill both requirements stated in the

PAC 20/2001 prior to 01/10/2001. However, it appears that the learned DSG

has not accurately examined P12 when claiming to the state the order of the AAT

is correct which states that the petitioner only reaches the E.B. salary scale on

26/02/2003.

Yet, in the instant case it is evident the petitioner has fulfilled both requirements

of completing the age of 45 years and reaching the Efficiency Bar salary step prior

to 01/10/2001 which is the date of implementation the PAC 20/2001 and is

thereby eligible for the said exemption from the Efficiency Bar Examination.

As such, the impugned order by the AAT delivered on 08/02/2018 could be

deemed as prima facie erroneous as it states, Although the appellant had

completed 45 years of age before 01/10/2001, he would be reaching the E.B.

salary point only on 26/02/2003 that was a later date than the effective date of

P.A. Circular No. 20/2001 of 12/09/2001..(emphasis added) Thus, the

counsel for the petitioner argued that the AAT order is error on the face of record,

as the date on which the petitioner reaches the required salary step is identified

erroneously as 26/02/2003 when he has already reached the salary scale

requirement (proved by P12) prior to the implementation date (01/10/2001) of

the PAC 20/2001.

For an order to be quashed for error, that error must appear upon its face.

Accordingly, there has arisen a deal of confusion as a record, though consistent

in its parts with no error appearing may, on comparison with some extraneous

11

CA-WRIT-254-2018 Page 11 of 12 10/05/2023 IJ-20-23

document or information appear to be erroneous in its presumptions or mode of

reasoning. In the case of Brittain v. Kinnaird 129 E.R. 789 admittedly a case

primarily on the issue of jurisdiction, the opening comments of Burrough J. are

of relevance in considering certiorari for error of law: where a magistrate has

jurisdiction, a conviction having no defects on the face of it is conclusive evidence

of the facts which it alleges. It is not enough that the record should be erroneous,

it must appear upon its face to be erroneous. So far is this notion of

'incontrollable veritie' of the record carried, that it has been a subject for

academic discussion whether the text of a statute, relevant to the original issue

is or is not a part of the 'record' of the original proceedings.

R (Cart) v Upper Tribunal [2011] UKSC 28 - This case concerned an appeal from

a decision of the Upper Tribunal. The Supreme Court held that the Upper

Tribunal had made an error on the face of the record by failing to consider

relevant evidence, and therefore its decision was quashed.

R v Central Criminal Court ex parte Clarke [1994] 1 WLR 1084 - This case

concerned an application for judicial review of the Central Criminal Court's

decision to refuse to grant bail. The High Court held that the Central Criminal

Court had made an error on the face of the record by failing to consider relevant

evidence, and therefore the decision was quashed

While considering the fourth proposition whether the writ can be issued in the

case of a decision which was erroneous in law, in the case of Nagendra Nath

Bora & Another vs The Commissioner of Hills 1958 AIR 398 decided on

07/02/1958 it was observed that "It may therefore be taken as settled that a writ

of certiorari could be issued to correct an error of law. But it is essential that it

should be something more than a mere error: it must be one which must be manifest

on the face of the record."

Since the decision by the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Nicholson v.

Haldimand-Norfolk Regional Police Commissioners, (1979) 1 S.C.R. 311

decided on 03/10/1979 the ambit of certiorari has been expanded to supervise

the procedural fairness of merely administrative bodies. In principle, therefore,

12

CA-WRIT-254-2018 Page 12 of 12 10/05/2023 IJ-20-23

certiorari should be available to correct errors of law committed by merely

administrative bodies, and not be restricted to those which are exercising judicial

or quasi-judicial functions.

After considering the above findings, this Court has determined that the AAT's

order is erroneous and constitutes an error on the face of the record due to its

failure to consider relevant documents properly. The petitioner has fulfilled the

requirements for exemption from the Efficiency Bar Examination and therefore

has a legitimate expectation of eligibility. Accordingly, this Court rules that the

petitioner is entitled to be promoted to Class II of the SLPS effective from

01/09/2009, having completed 10 years of service and receiving due concessions

accordingly. Hence, a Writ of Certiorari is issued to quash the AAT's order dated

08/02/2018. Further, the petitioner is entitled to receive other benefits that come

with the promotion to the higher grade, with effect from September 1, 2009.
