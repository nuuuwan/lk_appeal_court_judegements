Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The 3rd Respondent Company was granted permission by the 1st Respondent - Commissioner

General of Labour (Commissioner) under the powers vested in the said Commissioner in

Page 6 of 12

terms of section 2(2) of the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions)

Act No.45 of 1971 (TEWA) to terminate the services of employees whose names are

mentioned in the schedule to his decision dated 09.05.2022 marked P2(p). Such permission

has been granted subject to payment of compensation to such employees, computed in

accordance with the approved formula published in the Gazette notification No. 1384/07

dated 15.03.2005 (amended by Gazette notification No. 2216/17 dated 25.02.2021). The

Petitioners among other reliefs seek a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing

the said order P2(p) of the Commissioner.

At the hearing of the instant Application, the Court observed that two questions similar to the

ones below, need to be resolved:

(a) Whether it is reasonable to employ the doctrine of ultra vires in this case when

considering the overall circumstances relating to the instant Application?

(b) Whether the Commissioner has considered adequate evidence upon the

reasons tendered by the 3rd Respondent Company for its decision to wind up

the Company?

The reasons given by the 3rd Respondent for the application to terminate the services of the

employees (including the Petitioners) are based on their decision to wind up the Company on

the pretext that the Companys business orders were affected badly as a result of the COVID

19 pandemic and also due to the alleged Chinese-American trade hostilities.

The Petitioners contend that the 3rd Respondent (Company) presented the facts it seeks to

establish at the inquiry by way of an affidavit affirmed by one Rasika Amarakoon on

03.03.2022 and no opportunity was afforded by the 2nd Respondent to subject the facts

contained therein for cross-examination. Further, the Petitioners submit that the

facts/documents asserted by the 3rd Respondent were not subjected to proof of verification

and accordingly the application to the Commissioner by the Company should be dismissed.

Another complaint made by the Petitioners was that they were not informed by the 2nd

Respondent regarding the criteria for determining the admissibility of facts which were

disputed by them. The Petitioners have taken much effort to establish the stance that the

Commissioner cannot make an order under the law upon the existence of a particular fact

Page 7 of 12

that is not subjected to transparent and verifiable proof by the party who asserts such facts.

The Petitioners argue that the 1st Respondent has contemplated to examine or consider facts

that are irrefutably not part of the official record pertaining to the inquiry. It is further

submitted that the statutory inquiry ought to be transparent and verifiable and cannot

contain secret references that can be excluded from scrutiny. In a nutshell, the Petitioner's

prime assertion is that the Commissioner or the 2nd Respondent conducted the inquiry on the

3rd Respondents application contrary to the principles of natural justice.

Apart from the above, the Petitioners are raising a claim upon their request made to the 2nd

Respondent - Inquiry Officer to gain a copy of the inquiry brief. The Petitioners, having

noticed that the documents contained in the said copy of the brief were not in a consistent

chronological order and further the pages 234-242 were missing, have subsequently written

to the Inquiry Officer seeking such missing pages. The said Inquiry Officer, in response to this

request, has informed the 1st Petitioner that she was unable to share the missing pages with

the Petitioners as such are internal notes relating to the inquiry.

Nevertheless, it appears that the 3rd Respondent based on its decision to wind up the Company

has offered a voluntary severance scheme (VSS) to all the employees of 3 factories linked to

the said Company. All employees of the two factories in Ja Ela and Kegalle have accepted the

said VSS. However, the 1st Petitioner Union has disputed the said scheme in regard to the

factory in Koggala. Anyhow, it is evident that all the employees at the said Koggala factory

except the 2nd to 20th Petitioners have accepted the VSS during different stages of the process

of making payments. The contention of the 3rd Respondent is that the prerogative of the

Commissioner to hold an inquiry under TEWA is limited to test the veracity of the application

submitted by the 3rd Respondent and to ensure that the employees receive the compensation

envisaged by law. It was argued on behalf of the 3rd Respondent that the instant Application

of the Petitioner is misconceived in fact and law and thus made malafide by suppressing the

material facts described in their pleadings. Predominantly the 3rd Respondent raises a vital

question as to how it could re-employ the above-named 19 Petitioners at a time when the

operation of the Company has ceased, due to no fault or neglect on the part of the said

Company.

Page 8 of 12

In addition to the above, the Petitioners sought in argument that the Commissioner is

entrusted with the powers of a District Court under the provisions of sections 12, 13, 14 and

17B of TEWA, for the purposes of any inquiry conducted by him under the said Act. The

Petitioners referring to section 17 of the Act argue that there remains a requirement to conduct

an inquiry by the Commissioner consistent with the principles of natural justice.1

On a careful perusal of the provisions of the TEWA, it appears that two instances can be

possibly envisaged in respect of termination of employment under this Act. Firstly, an

employer may terminate the employment of workmen inconsistent with the provisions in

section 2(1) of TEWA2 and the second instance would be that the employer terminates the

employment of workmen duly following the provisions of the said section 2(1). The

termination referred to in the instant Application falls into the above second limb as the 3rd

Respondent (employer) has duly obtained permission from the Commissioner before

terminating the employment of the respective workmen. However, the question that needs to

be resolved in this Application is whether the Commissioner has exercised his discretion

lawfully when granting such permission to the 3rd Respondent.

At this stage, it is important to note that the requirement of holding an inquiry under section

12 of TEWA by the Commissioner, as he may consider necessary, emanates only when an

employer commits an offense identified by the TEWA. Section 2(3), spells out the offense for

which any person will be found guilty by failing to comply with any decision made by the

Commissioner under section 2(2). Similarly, section 7(1) and 14 also identifies two respective

offenses under the Act, whereas the offense of contempt3 is recognized in section 17B(1)(b).

There is no doubt that the Commissioner, in reference to the case at hand, has not conducted

any inquiry on any matter emanated under the aforesaid sections in which the particular

1 Section 17 reads (The proceedings at any inquiry held by the Commissioner for the purposes of this Act may be conducted by the Commissioner in any manner, not inconsistent with the principles of natural justice, which to the Commissioner may seem best adapted to elicit proof or information concerning matters that arise at such inquiry) 2 Section 2(1) reads - (1) No employer shall terminate the scheduled employment of any workman without - (a) the prior consent in writing of the workman; or (b) the prior written approval of the Commissioner. 3 Offense of contempt against or in disrespect of the authority of the Commissioner.

Page 9 of 12

offenses have been identified. In other words, the Commissioner has not inquired into an

offense committed under the TEWA, either by the Petitioners or the 3rd Respondent.

It is obvious that the word inquiry has not been embodied anywhere in section 2 of TEWA

and instead specifies a requirement of affording the workman an opportunity to be heard. I

do not intend here to examine whether affording an opportunity to be heard would eventually

amount to an inquiry or not and it is because such an aspect doesnt necessarily fall within

the ambit of this judgement. Anyhow, it can be assumed that there is a clear distinction

between the requirement of the workman being heard as per in section 2(2) and holding an

inquiry upon an offense committed under the TEWA. I arrived at this finding due to the

discretionary nature of the power conferred on the Commissioner by the legislature when he

grants or refuses approval on an application seeking permission for termination. The power

bestowed on the Commissioner to make such a decision has been described as an absolute

discretion of the Commissioner. It appears that the Parliament has given more prominence

to the absolute discretion of the Commissioner than holding a usual inquiry prior to granting

or refusing permission under section 2(2) and this point of view is further supported by the

special ouster clause introduced in section 2(2)(f)4. Anyhow, I do not intend to hold that the

Commissioner should not follow the principles of natural justice when he exercises his

absolute discretion under the said section as such discretion is absolutely not unfettered.

In terms of section 22 of the Interpretation Ordinance, the Court of Appeal, when exercising

its powers under Article 140 of the Constitution may review impugned decisions on the

matters stipulated in section 22(a) and (b) of the said Ordinance, even in the presence of an

ouster clause. However, in terms of section 2(2)(f) any decision made by the Commissioner

under section 2(2) shall not be called into question even by way of a writ application. Anyhow,

in this regard, I need to draw my attention to the judgment of Mark Fernando J. (in agreement

with Dheeraratne J. Wadugodapitiya J.) in Atapattu and others v. People's Bank and others

4 Section 2(2)(f) :

(f) any decision made by the Commissioner under the preceding provisions of this subsections shall be final and conclusive, and shall not be called in question whether by way of writ or otherwise

(i) in any court, or

(ii) in any court, tribunal or other institution established under the Industrial Disputes Act.

Page 10 of 12

(1997) 1 Sri. L.R. 208 where he has considered the apparent conflict between the ouster clause

(which is pre-Constitution legislation), and Article 140. It is observed that section 2(2)(f) of

TEWA was enacted before 19785. The Supreme Court in the above case referring to the phrase

"subject to the provisions of the Constitution stipulated in Article 140 held6 as follows:

Apart from any other consideration, if it became necessary to decide which was to prevail - an

ouster clause in an ordinary law or a Constitutional provision conferring writ jurisdiction on a

Superior Court, "subject to the provisions of the Constitution - I would unhesitatingly hold

that the latter prevails, because the presumption must always be in favour of a jurisdiction

which enhances the protection of the Rule of Law, and against an ouster clause which tends

to undermine it (see also Jailabdeen v. Danina Umma (1962) 64 N.L.R. 419, 422). But no such

presumption is needed, because it is clear that the phrase "subject to the provisions of the

Constitution was necessary to avoid conflicts between Article 140 and other Constitutional

provisions - such as Article 80(3), 120, 124, 125, and 126(3). That phrase refers only to contrary

provisions in the Constitution itself, and does not extend to provisions of other written laws, which

are kept alive by Article 168(1), where the Constitution contemplated that its provisions may be

restricted by the provisions of Article 138 which is subject to any law (Emphasis added)

The eloquent words of the erudite judges of the Supreme Court in those three cases have laid

down a clear principle that the writ jurisdiction exercised by the Supreme Court and the writ

jurisdiction exercised by the Court of Appeal under Article 140 is unfettered7.

Thus, I need to examine, based on the circumstances of this case, whether the Petitioners

have submitted adequate grounds to substantiate their argument that the Commissioner has

violated the principles of natural justice when making the impugned decision P2(n) and

P2(p).

5 The current Constitution of Sri Lanka was certified on 31st of August 1978 6 The Supreme Court has again upheld the dicta of the said Atapattu case (judgement by Mark Fernando J.) in B. Sirisena Cooray vs. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and two others (1999) 1 Sri. L.R. 1 (at p. 12) (judgement by Dheeraratne J.) and Wijayapala Mendis vs. P. R. P. Perera and others (1999) 2 Sri. L.R. 110 (at p. 119) (judgement by Mark Fernando J.). 7 see Blue Ocean Reality (Private) Limited v People's Bank and Others CA/WRIT/228/2022 decided on 28.10.2022

Page 11 of 12

I take the view that the dicta in the case of Chairman, Pradeshiya Sabha, Dimbulagala v. Chief

Minister, North Central Province and Others CA/Writ/ 168/2015 decided on 22.06.2020, upon

which the Petitioner has placed reliance, should be followed here, especially in respect of the

principles of natural justice contemplated in the instant Application. His Lordship Justice

Janak De Silva held as follows in the said case:

The rules of natural justice are not engraved in stone. The exact scope of the requirements of

fairness depends on the circumstances of each case, such as the character of the decision making

body, the type of decision to be made, and the statutory framework which guides the decision

making body

The Court of Appeal is sometimes constrained by its traditional mandate, which restricts its

purview to the examination of the legality of decisions or procedures rather than delving

extensively into the factual intricacies of a given case. Nevertheless, it is important to note

that in certain circumstances, the judge in the Review Court may exercise his discretion,

contingent upon a case-by-case assessment. This discretion may be invoked when a particular

Petitioner presents the Review Court with highly precise and substantiated statements,

complemented by pertinent evidence, explaining the grievances they have endured due to the

relevant authority's failure to duly exercise power prior to making a final decision. In such a

backdrop, I take the view that, if any litigant makes an allegation that a person who has been

entrusted to conduct an inquiry has not considered the relevant facts, he should at least outline

to Court at the review stage about such alleged facts that were ignored or disregarded by the

respective inquiry officer. This is because, Court finally decides a writ application on an

overall consideration of the facts and law relating to the questions before Court.

All that has been highlighted by the Petitioners in the instant Application is that the Inquiry

Officer had failed to provide them with a complete inquiry brief and the allegation that the

3rd Respondent has failed to prove its assertions. As pleaded in paragraph 39 of the amended

Petition, the Petitioners have drawn the attention of this Court to five selected reasons

purportedly given by the Commissioner when granting permission to terminate the services

of the workmen. The Petitioners' analysis of those reasons focuses primarily on the alleged

non-disclosure of the sources from which the Commissioner acquired the information

underpinning his above reasons.

Page 12 of 12

Further, it appears that no specifications have been given by the Petitioners as to how the

allegations raised by them have strongly influenced the Commissioners decision to approve

the termination of services of the employees of the relevant Company. Another noteworthy

aspect is that the Petitioners have not raised any objections when the 2nd Respondent notified

the parties on 17.02.2022, [Vide - "P2(e),"] that the testimony in respect of the inquiry will be

obtained in writing and both parties would be given the same opportunity. In such a scenario,

it is difficult to understand why the Petitioners are making a claim at this review stage on their

lost opportunity of cross examining the opponent witness.

In light of the reasons given above, I take the view that no comprehensive submission has

been made by the Petitioners in support of their case in the instant Application. Hence, I do

not see any reasonable grounds for this Court to exercise its inherent powers disregarding

even the aforesaid ouster clause to grant relief as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition

considering solely the violation of the principles of natural justice allegedly committed by the

1st and 2nd Respondents.

In the circumstances, I am not inclined to accept the proposition of the Petitioners that the

Commissioner has not considered adequate evidence upon the reasons tendered by the 3rd

Respondent Company for its decision to wind up the Company. Further, I hold that it is not

reasonable to employ the doctrine of ultra vires when considering the overall circumstances

of the instant Application. Thus, I proceed to dismiss the instant Application of the Petitioner.

I order no costs.
