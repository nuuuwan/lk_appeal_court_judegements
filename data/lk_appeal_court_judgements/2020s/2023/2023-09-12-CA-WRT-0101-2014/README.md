computed thereon from the respective due dates of the said refunds in

2001 and 2002 up to 31.12.2013 subject to any appropriate

terms/conditions.

Facts in brief as stated by the Petitioner.

The petitioner carries on garments manufacturing business for export under

the name and style of Jaffer Sons Garments. Jaffer Sons Garments has

been registered under the Goods and Services Tax Act No. 34 of 1996.

(hereinafter referred to as the GST Act) and has been assigned the GST

Registration No. 700520803-5000.

The petitioner has submitted GST returns to the respondent for the following

periods and the claimed refunds are set out below.

The respondent objected to this application.

The respondent submitted that the notice dated 24.10.2002 marked P7 was

issued to the petitioner by the respondent with regard to the taxable period

2002/6 seeking the following documents.

i. Copies of the Returns furnished.

ii Original cusdecs in respect of the input tax claimed for the period.

iii. A schedule of GST paid on other purchases.

Further, it was submitted that similar notices would have been sent to the

petitioner for the remaining periods. However, considering the significant

time that has passed since 2001, the Department of Inland Revenue no

longer possesses the above-mentioned notices.) The respondent stated that

notice dated 29.07.2002, was issued to the petitioner regarding the taxable

period 2002/07 seeking the following documents.

i. Copies of the Returns furnished.

ii. Original Cusdecs in respect of the input tax claimed for the period.

iii. A schedule of GST paid on other purchases.

A copy of the notice dated 29.07.2003 marked R1 was produced.

The respondent further stated that they had not received the original

invoices and other documents as requested, and accordingly, the respondent

was unable to process the refund claims of the petitioner. The respondent

stated that if the petitioner had submitted the original invoices to the

Department of Inland Revenue, an acknowledgement of receipt would have

been issued. In light of these circumstances, the respondent contends that

the petitioner is not entitled to the GST refund as claimed.

7

7

The respondent denies the receipt of the letters marked P8 dated 7.6.2010

and P11 dated 14.2.2011 while acknowledging receipt of P12.

The respondent denies the fact that original invoices and other supporting

documents were submitted to the respondent in the years 2001 and 2002.

Since the petitioner has failed to produce relevant documents to substantiate

his GST refund claims, the respondent was not in a position to proceed with

the claims.

In addition to the above objections, the respondent has taken up the

following objections to the petitioners application.

a. The petitioners application is vexatious and misconceived in law.

b. The petitioner's application is an abuse of the process of court.

c. Petitioner is guilty of laches.

d. The petitioner has suppressed and misrepresented material facts.

The petitioner argues that the respondent did not dispute the petitioners

claim for a GST refund when he submitted requests for the refund.

Furthermore, the petitioner contends that the respondent acknowledged and

accepted these claims for the GST refund.

Section 22 (1), 22 (2), and 22 (3) of the GST Act provides as follows:

22.

(1) A registered person shall, in respect of taxable supplies made by him,

account for and pay the tax by reference to such taxable periods at such

time and in such manner as may be specified in the Act.

(2) Subject to the provisions of the Act, a registered person is entitled at the

end of each such period to credit for so much of his input tax as is

8

8

allowable under this Act. And then to deduct such amount from any

output tax that is due from him.

(3) Where goods or services supplied to a registered person, or goods

imported by him, are used or to be used partly for the purposes of a

taxable activity carried on or carried out by him and partly for other

purposes, the tax on supplies and importations shall be apportioned so

that only so much of the tax on such supply or importation as is

referable to his taxable activity shall be counted as his input tax.

In order to claim GST refund, a registered person must satisfy that he is

entitled to recover the excessive input tax in terms of the GST Act.

Sections 58 and 59 of the GST Act are as follows:

58

(1)Where a registered person makes an application for a refund of any tax or

any penalty paid by him in excess during the taxable period within three

years immediately after the end of the taxable period and satisfies the

Commissioner-General that such person has paid any tax or any

penalty in excess of the amount which he was liable to pay for that

period, such person shall be entitled to a refund of the amount paid

in excess, subject to provisions of subsection (3):

(2) Where through death, incapacity, bankruptcy, liquidation or other cause a

registered person who would but for such cause have been entitled to make a

claim under subsection (1) is unable to do so, his executor, trustee or receiver

as the case may be, shall be entitled to a refund of any tax or penalty paid in

excess within the meaning of subsection (1) by such person for the benefit of

such person or his estate.

(3) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1)-

(a) Where any registered person has failed to pay the Commissioner-

General in whole or in part, any tax in respect of any taxable period, or

9

9

a month in a taxable period, any amount of tax payable before the due

date may be set off after due notice to such person against that unpaid

tax, any amount or any part of any amount otherwise refundable to that

person or any amount or part of any amount of interest payable to that

person under section 59, and shall treat any amount so set off as a

payment received from such registered person.

(b) Where any registered person, in respect of, any taxable period or in a

month in a taxable period has not furnished a return for any taxable

period or a month in a taxable period, the Commissioner-General may

withhold payment of any amount otherwise refundable or any amount

of interest payable under section 59 of this Act, until such registered

person has furnished such return.

59.

(1) Where any amount refundable under this Act to refunds a registered

person has not been refunded within a period of thirty days from the

due date of such refund there shall be paid by the Commissioner-

General to such person interest on such amount for the period

commencing on the Thirtieth day from the due date up to the date of

refund of the amount as is required to be refunded by the

Commissioner-General to such person under this Act, at the rate

prescribed by the Minister from time to time

(2) For the purposes of this section due date means the period ending

ninety days

(i) From the date of any agreement with an Assessor or from the

date of determination of an appeal in respect of the assessment

appealed against or ;

(ii) From the date on which a claim , other than a claim for a refund

made in writing under subsection (4) of section 22 was received

from such person by the Commissioner-General

10

10

In terms of the provisions of Section 58, the petitioner must satisfy the

Commissioner-General that he has paid an excess amount of tax or penalty

for that specific period and is entitled to a refund. The petitioner is required

to prove this by presenting relevant documents.

The petitioner had submitted photocopies of certain invoices, but the

respondent denied the claim that the originals of those invoices were

received by them.

After P7 dated 24.10.2002 and R1 reminder dated 29.07.2003 was issued to

the petitioner by the respondent, no further correspondence had taken place

between the parties until P8 dated 7.6.2010. The respondent denies the

receipt of P8. Even if we assume that P8 was, in fact, sent to the respondent,

yet there remains a silence gap of seven years.

The respondent admits the receipt of P9 dated 27.10.2010, and P10 affidavit

dated 23.12.2010. By letter P13 dated 6.9.2011, the respondent informed

the petitioner to provide tax invoices relevant to the GST claim. In response

to P13, the petitioner had sent letter P14 dated 13.12.2011, stating that the

petitioner had submitted all relevant documents to an officer in the Inland

Revenue Department 10 years earlier. Prior to the letter marked P14, there

was no letter sent by the petitioner to the respondent stating that he had

handed over the relevant documents to an officer of the Inland Revenue

Department.

It is evident that the petitioner is required to establish his entitlement for

GST refund by producing relevant documents. In this application, there is

no proof that the petitioner had submitted all relevant documents to the

respondent. The respondent states that if the respondent had accepted the

documents, a receipt of acknowledgement would have been issued to the

petitioner. However, no such receipt was produced by the petitioner. The

facts that are necessary to ascertain the entitlement of the petitioner are in

11

11

dispute. Even though the petitioner claimed that the respondent had not

disputed and conceded the petitioner's claim for refund at the time such

claims were submitted to the respondent, the respondent had issued notices

to the petitioner requesting the originals of tax invoices, cusdecs and other

relevant documents to substantiate the claims. There is no evidence to

prove that the petitioner had supplied the relevant documents to the

respondent. The respondent denies the photocopies of the invoices produced

by the petitioner in this court. Further, the respondent states that the total

value indicated in the invoices(photocopies) is higher than the total income

reported by Gulistan Textiles (Pvt) Ltd, for the entire year, as indicated in the

documents submitted by it for income tax purposes. In response, the

petitioner states that such matters should be resolved by the respondent in

consultation with Gulistan Textiles (Pvt) Ltd.

There had been no correspondence between the petitioner and the

respondent from 2003 until 2010. The petitioner claimed that he had

submitted relevant tax invoices and other documents to the respondent

during that period. However, the petitioner had not provided even a

photocopy of a cusdec in this court.

The respondent in this application seriously disputes the position of the

petitioner that he had submitted the original invoices and other relevant

documents to the Inland Revenue Department. The respondent is not in a

position to proceed with the petitioners GST refund claims without the

required documents to prove the fact that the petitioner paid GST in excess.

In the case of Thajudeen vs Sri Lanka Tea Board [1981] 1SriLR 471,

Ranasinghe J (as he was then) quoted the following passage

CHOUDRI, in his book on the Law of Writs and Fundamental Rights

(2nd Ed.), Vol.2, states at page 381: "The rule has been stated that

mandamus will not lie to compel a public officer to perform a duty

dependent upon disputed and doubtful facts, or where the legal result

of the facts is subject to controversy. If the right is in serious doubt

12

12

the discretionary power rests with the officer to decide whether or not

he will enforce it, till the right shall have been established in some

proper action, and discretion fairly exercised in such circumstances

cannot be controlled by mandamus;" and, at page 449: "Where facts

are in dispute and in order to get at the truth it is necessary that the

questions should be canvassed in a suit where parties would have

ample opportunity of examining their witnesses and the Court would

be better able to judge which version is correct, a writ will not issue."

Further, it says as follows:

When, however, such questions of fact are in dispute, they can and

must only be settled by a regular action between the disputants before

the appropriate Court of First Instance. Such questions, the decision

of which calls for the leading of evidence, both oral and documentary

and the cross-examination of witnesses are all questions which can be

best decided by way of regular procedure falling within the ordinary

jurisdiction of the Courts of First Instance.

Without proving necessary facts no public right will arise for the petitioner to

seek for a Writ of Mandamus. As the petitioner has not provided the required

documents to support the GST refund claims, there is no obligation on the

part of the respondent to make payments in the form of GST refunds.

The petitioner is guilty of laches.

The petitioner filed this application in 2014 seeking a Writ of Mandamus

directing the respondent to make payments for the claims for GST refunds in

respect of 2001 and 2002, after a delay of 12 years. When the petitioner was

notified to produce the relevant documents in 2002 and 2003 there was no

response from the petitioner. Correspondence between parties started about

seven years later, in 2010, that was initiated by the petitioner. The

petitioner has not provided any explanation for the prolonged lack of

communication. This application before this court was filed 12 years after

13

13

that claim. The petitioner has not explained the 12-year delay when making

this application. In the written submission on behalf of the petitioner, it was

submitted that there is a provision in the Act to pay interest for the delayed

period, thereby making the delay irrelevant.

The provisions to pay interest for the money due have been provided for the

benefit of the applicants if the payments are delayed. The petitioner cannot

make use of that provision to excuse delay and laches. Furthermore, the Act

provides to pay interest after 90 days. When comparing 90 days to 12 years,

the delay on the part of the petitioner is excessive and unreasonable. The

submission in this regard is not tenable given the circumstances of the case.

In the case of Ramasamy vs Ceylon State Mortgage Bank 78NLR 510

Wanasundera J, quoting from a Privy Council case of Lindsay Petroleum

Company vs Hurd, stated as follows:

The doctrine of laches in Court of Equity is not an arbitrary or a

technical doctrine. Where it would be practically unjust to give a

remedy, either because the party has, by his conduct, done that which

might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his

conduct and neglect he has, though perhaps not waiving that remedy,

yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable

to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of

these cases, lapse of time and delay are most material. But in every

case, if an argument against relief, which otherwise should be unjust, is

founded upon mere delay, that delay of course not amounting to a bar

by any Statute of Limitations, the validity of that defence must be tried

upon principles substantially equitable. Two circumstances, always

important in such cases, are, the length of the delay and the nature of

the acts done during the interval which might affect either party and

cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one course or the

other, so far as relates to the remedy.

14

14

In the case of Athula Ratnayake vs Jayasinge 78NLR 35, the Supreme Court

held that the delay of one year and three months, which had not been

satisfactorily explained by the petitioner, barred the remedy. The Court has a

discretion which it could exercise to refuse the application on the ground

that there had been undue delay in bringing the proceedings.

In the case of Rev. Seruwila Sarankithi and others v The Attorney General

and others [2004]1Sri LR 356 Wijayaratne J has quoted the case of Abdul

Rahuman v The Mayor of Colombo 69NLR 211 with regard to the unexplained

delay, where it was held as follows:

it is sufficient for us to say that in view of this delay and the

consequences of such delay, an application for a writ of mandamus

must fail."

The petitioner has failed to substantiate the GST refund claims by producing

necessary documents. This application was filed 12 years after the refund

claims were initially submitted. The petitioner is guilty of laches. For the

reasons set out in this judgment, the application of the petitioner is

dismissed without costs.
