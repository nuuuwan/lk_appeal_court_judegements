Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused Appellants (hereinafter referred to as "the Accused") were indicted

before the High Court of Chillaw for the possession and trafficking of 333.7g grams of

Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) under Section 54A(d) and 54A(b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

The prosecution, in order to substantiate the charge examined six witnesses. The

1st and the 2nd Accused gave dock statements and did not call any witnesses. After the

trial, the Learned High Court Judge found both the Accused guilty on both counts,

convicted, and imposed Death sentence.

Being aggrieved by said judgment and sentence this appeal was preferred by the Accused.

The following Grounds of Appeal were urged by the counsel for the Accused.

A. The learned trial judge has failed to consider the need to adduce evidence of the

Driver of the Van alleged to have been used by the accused, especially when the

conduct of such a raid is vehemently disputed by the defence.

Page 3 of 9

B. The learned trial judge has failed to consider the glaring improbabilities and

lapses in the prosecution version of the alleged raid which warrant calling of the

said driver of the van as an independent witness.

C. The learned trial Judge has not considered the gravity of the failure by the

prosecution to submit the vehicle alleged to have been used by the accused to be

identified at the trial by which substantial prejudice was caused to the accused

depriving them of a fair trial.

D. The learned trial judge has misdirected himself in law by not forming an inference

under sec 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance with regard to non-production of the

van of the accused in the trial and failure to call its driver as a witness.

E. The learned trial judge has unduly burdened the accused by expecting them to

prove certain facts, which is against establishes law.

F. The learned judge has erred in law, by considering against the accused, several

facts which have not been proved in Court, and which also irrelevant to the

matter.

The relevant facts giving rise to the prosecution are that on 09.03.2006 Prosecution

Witness 02 (PW02) received information from his private informant about a consignment

of drugs brought via boats from India being transported to Colombo. They were informed

that the drugs would be transferred among parties at a certain place on the Chilaw-

Colombo road in the Mahawewa area.

A team of 10 police officers proceeded to the said location and observed the said

suspicious vehicle (van) from a distance of 50 meters. At around 5:55 am another

suspicious motorcycle approached the said van, the officers noticed a parcel being passed.

Then they promptly obstructed the van and searched it. Two parcels of Heroin were

recovered from the two Accused who instantaneously tried to hide the said parcels.

Although the officers gave directions to trap the motorcyclist, they managed to escape and

there was no trace to be found.

The aforementioned officers recovered heroin weighing 2kg106g parcel from the 1st

Accused and 2kg 0.070 grams from the 2nd Accused respectively while they were trying to

hide when the raid took place surrounding the van. The said parcel was wrapped using a

Tamil newspaper and sealed with gum tape. According to the Government Analyst, it

contained 333.7 grams of pure heroin.

There is clear evidence to show that the person who came on the motorbike had

given both parcels to the rear side of the van.

On page 134 of the Appeal brief,

Evidence led in the action clearly shows that the parcel was not given to the driver.

And it is also evident that the parcel was handed over to the Accused who was in the rear

side of the van. It was further established that once the police opened the door both the

Accused tried to hide the parcels. It shows that both Accused had exclusive conscious

control over the property. The only inference that can be drawn is that both Accused were

in joint possession of the Heroin. This conduct of the Accused suggests that they have

knowledge of what the parcel contained. if they didnt know what was in the parcel, they

would not have tried to hide it when the officers raided the said vehicle.

Upon the conclusion of the evidence of the prosecution, In the Dock statement both

the Accused vehemently denied the said accusation. However, the second Accused in his

dock statement accepted the fact that he was inside the van at the time of the raid.

On Page 391 of Appeal brief;

" ..."

In the instant case, Both Accused were charged with joint possession and

trafficking of Heroin and convicted on the basis that all the Accused were presented in

the said location at the time of the raid.

The issue is whether they had the requisite knowledge that the parcels which was

in their possession contained Heroin.

General Possession is defined in Strouds Judicial Dictionary of Words and

Phrases Eighth Edition Volume 3, Greenberg, page 2223;

"Controlled drug in his possession" (Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (c.38) s.5(2)). A man

who put a small quantity of cannabis into his wallet, knowing what it was, remained in

"possession" of it within the meaning of this section even though he had long forgotten it

was there (R. v Martindale [1986] 1 W.L.R. 1042). A woman who did no more than live

with a man at a time when he possessed and dealt in drugs was not herself guilty of

possession, notwithstanding that she must have known what he was doing (R. v Bland

[1988] Crim. L.R. 41). Where an accused was apprehended while delivering a box

containing cannabis resin to a co-defendant, he was held to be guilty of having a

"controlled drug in his possession", notwithstanding his claim that he thought the box

contained pornographic videos (R. v McNamara (1988) 87 Cr.App.R. 246). In construing

the word "possession" the question to be asked was whether on the facts the defendant

had been proved to have, or ought to have imputed to him, the intention to possess what

was in fact a controlled drug (R. v Lewis (1988) 87 Cr.App.R. 270).

Lord Wilberforce in Warner v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner (1968) 52

Criminal Appeal Report 373. has considered this matter;

The question, to which an answer is required, and in the end, a jury must answer

it, is whether in the circumstances the Accused should be held to have possession of the

substance, rather than mere control. In order to decide between these two, the jury should,

in my opinion, be invited to consider all the circumstances- to use again the words of

Page 6 of 9

Pollock and Wright, possession in the common law, P. 119- the modes or events by which

the custody commences and the legal incident in which it is held. By these I mean, relating

them to typical situations, that they must consider the manner and circumstances in

which the substance, or something which contains it, had been received, what knowledge

or means of knowledge or guilty knowledge as to the presence of the substance, or as to

the nature of what has been received, the Accused had at the time of receipt or thereafter

up to the moment when he is found with it; his legal relation to the substance or package

(including his right of access to it). On such matters as these (not exhaustively stated)

they must make the decision whether, in addition to physical control, he has, or ought to

have imputed to him the intention to possess, or knowledge that he does possess, what is,

in fact, a prohibited substance. If he has this intention or knowledge, it is not additionally

necessary that he should know the nature of the substances.

Lord Widgery CJ in R v. Searle and Others, The Criminal Law Review 1971,592,

Held that;

If you think they were and that they all knew that those drugs were then in the

possession of other people and they knew they were drugs then you probably will not have

any difficulty in deciding that they are guilty, whichever of them you think is guilty, and

is it conceivable, do you think, that drugs were there in (those) quantities without

anybody or everybody in the van knowing about it and that they were dangerous drugs?

That really is the essence of the case.

Held, allowing the appeals, the effect of those parts of the summing -up was to

equate knowledge with possession. However, mere knowledge of the presence of a

forbidden article in the hands of a confederate was not enough: joint possession had to be

established. The sort of direction which ought to have been given was to ask the jury to

consider whether the drugs formed a common pool from which all had the right to draw

at will, and whether there was a joint enterprise to consume drugs together because then

the possession of drugs by one of them in pursuance of that common intention might well

be possession on the part of all of them: Thompson (1869) 21 L.T. 397. The summing-up

was inadequate and possibly misleading. Although there was ample evidence to justify a

conviction it was impossible to say with certainty that all the defendants were guilty and

so it was not a case in which the proviso could be applied.

Page 7 of 9

Recently His Lordship Aluwihare PC J in the case of Mohamed Iqbal Mohamed

Sadath v. Attorney General, SC Appeal 110/15, (SC Minutes 14.12.2020), held:

Lord Wilberforce went on to state that, on such matters as above, though not

exhaustively stated, it must be decided whether in addition to physical control, he has or

ought to have imputed to him, the intention to possess or knowledge that he does possess,

what is in fact a prohibited substance. The above reasoning in my view is a rational

guideline that should be adopted in deciding as to whether the Accused had the knowledge

(the requisite mens rea) that what he possessed is a prohibited substance, even though he

may not have known the precise nature of the substance. Further, he held that: It would

not be unreasonable to presume that it was well within his knowledge that people do

smuggle contraband into the country under various guises, given the social standing of

the Accused.

In the instant case, the prosecution established the following facts,

1. The van was parked in an isolated area in the early morning.

2. Suddenly a motorcycle approached and gave the parcel to the backside of the van.

3. When the Police opened, they were trying to hide this parcel.

4. It shows that they knew what was contained in the parcel.

Hence the only inference that can be drawn is that the Accused had the requisite

knowledge the parcels contained Heroin.

What is the defense taken by the Accused? They have simply denied it.

Now the issue is once the prosecution discharged their burden, then the Accused

has to create a real doubt. I am mindful of the words uttered by Chief Justice, Mr. Drake,

and Justice Henry, in James MC Namara, 1988 (87) Cr. App. R. 246, Held that;

In the well-known case of Warner v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner (1968) 52

Cr. App. R. 373, [1969] 2 A.C. 256, Lord Wilberforce at p.433 and p. 300 respectively put

the matter thus:

the following propositions seem to us to emerge. First of all a man does not have

possession of something which has been put into his pocket or into his house without his

knowledge: in other words something which is planted on him, to use the

current vulgarism. Secondly, a mere mistake as to the quality of a thing under the

Page 8 of 9

defendants control is not enough to prevent him being in possession. For instance, if a

man is in possession of heroin, believing it to be cannabis or believing it perhaps to be

asprin.

Thirdly, if the defendant believe that the things is of a wholly different nature

from that which in fact it is, then the result, to use the words of Lord Pearce, would be

otherwise, Fourthly. in the case of a container or a box, the defendants possession of the

box leads to the strong inference that he is in possession of the contents or whatsoever it

is inside the box. But if the contents are quite different in kind from he believed, he is not

in possession of it.

.... the prima facie assumption is discharged if he proves (or raises a real

doubt in the matter) either (a) that he was a servant or bailee who had no right to open it

and no reason to suspect that its contents were illicit or were drugs or (b) that although

he was the owner he had no knowledge of including a genuine mistake as to) its actual

contents or of their illicit nature and that he received them innocently and also that he

had had no reasonable opportunity since receiving the package of acquainting himself

with its actual contents.

Here we hold that Accused had failed to create doubt from the statement he created

at the Dock. That he did not possess the requested knowledge.

One of the grounds urged by the defence counsel was that failure on the part of the

prosecution to produce the van to establish that the incident happened inside the van

subject to the information referred to by the counsel has not in our view caused prejudice

to the Accused for the reason that theres evidence by the 2nd Accused that he was inside

the van. Where the raid took place. Therefore, this ground for appeal will fail.

Another point raised by the defence is the failure to call the driver as a witness, as

indicated earlier theres no need to call the driver to give evidence as there's sufficient

evidence for the High Court Judge to believe the story given by other witnesses.

Page 9 of 9

For the above-said reasons, this Court is of the view that the grounds of appeal

raised by the Accused are without merit. We see no reason to interfere with the

Judgement dated 20th of September 2019. The conviction and the sentence are affirmed,

and the Appeal is accordingly dismissed.
