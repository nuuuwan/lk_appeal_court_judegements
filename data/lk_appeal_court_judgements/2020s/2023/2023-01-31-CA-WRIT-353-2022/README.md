Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

A writ of Certiorari is sought by the Petitioner to quash the quit notice (P19) issued against

the Petitioner under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979, as amended,

(Act) in reference to the land morefully described in the schedule (Land) to the said quit

notice. Additionally, the Petitioner seeks a writ of Prohibition to restrain the Respondents

from taking steps to eject her and also an interim order is sought to stay the proceedings in

the Magistrates Court of Balangoda case bearing No. 84337 filed against the Petitioner under

the said Act in respect of the same land.

The Petitioner pleads that the impugned quit notice is illegal, null & void and the decisions

taken by the 1st to 6th Respondents are inter alia illegal, ultra vires and unlawful. The

Petitioners alleged main grounds of challenge are;

i. impugned quit notice P19 was issued without a proper basis as the land concerned

is private land owned by the Petitioners husband

ii. the quit notice does not accurately identify the Land

iii. the quit notice was not duly served on the Petitioner and as such the Petitioner is

not in unauthorized occupation.

iv. summons in relations to the ejectment proceedings in the Magistrates Court of

Balangoda were not duly served on the Petitioner.

Whether the land concerned is private land

The Petitioner submits that her husband became the lawful owner of the subject premises by

virtue of Deed of Transfer, marked P2. A Deed of Declaration P2(a) also has been attested

in favour of the purchaser of the said Deed of Transfer, in respect of the same land. The

Petitioner pleads that the subject premises has been depicted as Lot No.322 in the Surveyor

Generals Final Village Plan No.200 and has been admitted as being private land as far back

in 1938.

The contention of the 1st Respondent is that the Petitioner has been recruited as a trainee clerk

by the 4th Respondent-Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation (SLSPC) and thereafter the

Petitioner was serving at the Hunuwella Estate within which the Petitioner has been provided

with an official quarters. As stated by the 1st Respondent, the impugned quit notice has been

served in respect of the premises of the said official quarters. Upon the Petitioner being

transferred to a different Estate, the Petitioner has been requested to hand over the official

quarters and however, the Petitioner had refused to adhere to the said request. The 1st

Respondent referring to the proceedings of the case bearing No. B/4707/03 in the Labour

Tribunal asserts that such proceedings of the Labour Tribunal and its order, marked R10,

clearly implies that the Petitioner had not contradicted or challenged the stand that the subject

premises was allocated to her as official quarters.

The 1st Respondent strenuously argues that the land described in the schedule of the said Deed

P2 has absolutely no nexus to the official quarters occupied by the Petitioner and her

husband which is situated in the Hunuwella Estate. Now a question arises whether this

Review Court can play the role of a trial judge and analyze evidence to identify the block of

land described in the said Deed P2 and differentiate such land with the Land described in

the Schedule to the quit notice

The precedent enunciated in several judgements of the superior courts is that the Act expressly

precludes the need for an inquiry by a competent authority before he forms the opinion that

any land is State Land (See- Farook vs. Gunawardena Government Agent Ampara (1980) 2 Sri.

L.R. 243).

Page 5 of 11

His Lordship Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere after analyzing the precedent laid down in related

judgements has taken an advanced approach in a recent case Udagedara Waththe Anusha

Kumari Nikaathagoda vs. Jayasinghe Mudiyanselage Chamila Indika Jayasinghe, Divisional

Secretary and others, CA/Writ/293/2017 decided on 18.11.2019 where His Lordship has held;

The principle then is that while no inquiry is needed to form an opinion, there should be a

rational basis to form the opinion that the State is lawfully entitled to the land. The rational basis

should satisfy the Wednesbury test of reasonableness. Thus, a Competent Authority would be

acting reasonably if he were acting on the basis of a Surveyor General's plan, even if the occupant

is claiming prescription. The Competent Authority is not expected to, and indeed is precluded

from, carrying out an inquiry. (Emphasis added)

In terms of Section 3(1) of the Act, if the competent authority is of the opinion; a) that any

land is a state land; b) that any person is in unauthorized possession or occupation of such

land he may take steps to evict the unauthorized occupants.

In light of the above, I take the view that there is no necessity for the Competent Authority to

establish that this Land upon which the quit notice has been served is State Land but his duty

should be to form an opinion under Section 3 of the Act on a rational basis. Hence, there is

no necessity based on the circumstances of the instant Application to investigate whether the

Land is State Land. Anyhow, a requirement exists for this Court to consider whether there

was a rational basis for the Competent Authority to form the opinion that the State is lawfully

entitled to the Land.

Availability of a rational basis

On a careful perusal of the Gazette Extraordinary No.815/10 published on 21.04.1994

(marked R2(d)), it appears that the agricultural and estate lands listed in the said Gazette

Notification including the Hunuwella Estate has been vested in the SLSPC in terms of Section

27A read together with Sections 22, 23 & 42H of the Land Reform Law No.1 of 1972. Thus,

the said Hunuwella Estate which was originally a land vested in the Land Reform

Commission has been subsequently vested in SLSPC in terms of the provisions of the law by

virtue of R2(d). In terms of the Interpretation Section 18 of the said State Lands (Recovery

of Possession) Act, land vested in or under the control of SLSPC falls within the category of

Page 6 of 11

State Land. The Indenture of Lease No.4834, marked R2(e) by which the SLSPC has leased

out the land including the Hunuwella Estate to the Kahawatta Plantations Limited would not

affect the title of the SLSPC to the land.

Now, I need to ascertain whether the official quarters referred to in the instant Application is

situated within the Land described in the Schedule to the quit notice. By letter dated

22.05.2022 (R3), the Superintendent of Hunuwella Estate has informed the Petitioner his

decision to take over the official quarters. The Petitioner has acknowledged the receipt of the

original of the said letter after making an endorsement to that effect on the face of the said

letter. The 1st paragraph of the letter R3;

I write with reference to the discussion I had with you on the even date in the presence of my

Asst.Superintendents Mr.Damith Mohottige and Mr.T.K. Jayaratne. As informed to you I have

decided to take-over the official quarters provided to you in Hunuwella North Division due to

administrative reasons.

In response to the said letter R3, the Petitioner has written the letter dated 09.06.2002

marked R5 wherein she has stated;

Official Quarters

I thank you for your letter dated 22.05.2002Subsequent to a visit by the former Group

Director Mr. R. M. Bondewya, he informed that the Quarters was in a dilapidated condition

and as the Company was having financial constraints if I was able to repair the Quarters he

would permit to moving, I have spent nearly Rs.80000/- and inform the Group director and

former Superintendent of Hunuwella they both confirmed that I could reside in this Quarters

until I am employed by Kahawatte Plantations Ltd.

..I am sincerely hoping that I will be allowed to continue staying in present Quarters.

(Emphasis added).

The Petitioner has made a further request by the letter dated 25.12.2002, marked R6, seeking

for an extension to occupy the said official quarters.

Page 7 of 11

The learned President of the Labour Tribunal of Balangoda in case bearing No. B/4707/03

(marked R10) has observed that the Petitioner had refused to be transferred from the official

quarters citing personal reasons. The said learned President has taken cognizance of the fact

that the Petitioners claim for alleged improvements made to the official quarters worth

Rs.180,000.00. Consequently, the learned Labour Tribunal President has arrived at a

conclusion based on overall evidence of the case that the main reason for not complying with

the transfer orders was the undesirability of the Petitioner to leave the official quarters and

accordingly, there cannot be any constructive termination of services (See-page 17 of R10).

In the circumstances, it can be well assumed that the purpose of issuing the quit notice was

due to the refusal of the Petitioner to vacate the said official quarters. This Court is unable to

resolve with the available material, the title issues in respect of the subject Land and

particularly the arguments of the Petitioner that the land described in the said Transfer Deed

P2 is not the same Land/Premises described in the schedule of the quit notice. Anyhow, for

the purpose of a fuller and proper adjudication of the instant Application, it is sufficient to

identify the Land described in the Schedule to the quit notice. The Review Court examining

the title of parties in an application filed based on the actions or decisions taken under the Act

would tend to undermine the clear intention of the legislature which introduced mighty

provisions to recover the possession of State Land in an expeditious manner.

The Land upon which the ejectment is sought has been morefully described in the schedule

to the quit notice P19 by sufficiently referring to the boundaries and the extent, although no

reference has been made to a specific plan. The Register of Settlements, marked P5 and the

documents, marked P9(a), P10(a) and P10(b), illustrate that the above official quarters is

situated on the Hunuwella Estate which belongs to the SLSPC. I am unable to accept the

Petitioners argument that the Land is private land as the Lot Nos. 311 (Hunuwalawatta)

and 322 (Hunuwala estate), among other, are subject to settlements effected under the said

Register of Settlements P5, according to the provisions of the Land Settlement Ordinance,

although such land comes under a column titled Admitted Private.

Thus, I take the view that the impugned quit notice is in accordance with the dicta enunciated

in M. I. Fernando vs. J. M. C. Priyadharshani-Authorized Officer/Competent Authority and

others, CA/Writ/484/2011 decided on 10.06.2021, a case heavily relied on by the Petitioner.

Page 8 of 11

The 1st Respondent tendering his affidavit to Court has affirmed that he had issued the quit

notice P19 after reaching the opinion that the Petitioner was in unauthorized occupation of

the Land upon consideration of the documents, marked R2(a) to R2(h). As per paragraph

17 of the said affidavit, the Gazette Notification which reflects the vesting order, the

(a)Indenture of Lease No.4834, (b)Field Plan No.1074 and (c)the Google maps are among

the documents he has perused.

It appears that the Kahawatta Plantations PLC has taken several steps to notify the 1st

Respondent of the unauthorized occupation of the land by the Petitioner. The 1st Respondent

by his letter dated 30.08.2017, marked R19, has requested the Petitioner to show cause on her

ownership and however, the Petitioner has failed to respond thereto. (See-R20)

Based on all the material made available to Court and the Order of the learned President of

the Labor Tribunal in case bearing No.B4707/03, I am convinced that the Competent

Authoritys main concern was to evict the Petitioner from the land upon which the said

official quarters is situated. I am compelled to accept the version of the 1st Respondent that

the Petitioner does not dispute the fact that she was given the subject premises as her official

quarters. My above reasoning precludes further evaluation of evidence by this Court as in a

Trial Court to decide whether the quit notice (P19) does not accurately identify the Land.

For the reasons set out above, I am convinced that the 1st Respondent has formed an opinion

on a rational basis under Section 3 of the Act that the State is lawfully entitled to the Land.

Nevertheless, the Petitioner is privileged under Section 12 of the Act to vindicate her title in

an appropriate Court of law.

Service of quit notice

The Petitioner contends that the proof of dispatch of the quit notice by registered post to the

correct person and to the address is a mandatory and essential preliminary requirement to

establish that the quit notice was deemed to be served on intended recipient. The Sections

3(1)(b) and 3(3) deal with the serving quit notices.

Page 9 of 11

Section 3(1)(b) reads;

that any person is in unauthorized possession or occupation of such land, the

competent authority may serve a notice on such person in possession or occupation

thereof, or where the competent authority considers such service impracticable or

inexpedient, exhibit such notice in a conspicuous place in or upon that land requiring

such person to vacate such land with his dependants, if any, and to deliver vacant

possession of such land to such competent authority or other authorized person as may

be specified in the notice on or before a specified date. The date to be specified in such

notice shall be a date not less than thirty days from the date of the issue or the

exhibition of such notice.

Section 3(3);

A quit notice in respect of any State land shall be deemed to have been served on the

person in possession or occupation thereof if such notice is sent by registered post.

The Petitioner heavily relies on the judgement of Gunaratne (Alexis Auction Rooms) vs.

Abeysinghe (Urban Development Authority) (1988) 1 Sri. L.R. 255 in order to emphasize her

above argument. The main two issues in the said Gunaratne case were; (i) when the Act

requires that the specified date to vacate the premises should be a date not less than 30 days

from the date of the issuance of the quit notice under Section 3, the appellant had been given

only 15 days notice to quit, (ii) no notice has been served on the company namely, Alexis

Auction Rooms, which was the tenant of the Respondent (Urban Development Authority).

The argument raised by the appellant in the said case was that the appellant namely,

Gunaratna was a Director of Alexis Auction Rooms (company).

On perusal of the quit notice P19 of the instant Application, it appears that such notice has

been served directly on the Petitioner in the month of May 2018 and a period not less than 30

days has been afforded to the Petitioner to vacate the Land. Before issuing the said quit notice,

the Ministry of Plantation Industries by way of its letter dated 30.08.2017 (R19) has

requested the Petitioner to vacate the Land before the said Ministry takes steps in terms of the

provisions of the Act to evict the Petitioner. Answering the relevant paragraph of the

Page 10 of 11

statement of objections (of the 1st Respondent) by which the said R19 was introduced, the

Petitioner has categorically admitted in her counter affidavit the receipt of the said R19 and

also the fact that she had not responded to the same.

Hence, it is difficult to believe that the Petitioner was totally unaware of any process to evict

her from the Land under the provisions of the Act. Even if there is no proof of dispatch of the

quit notice under registered cover, the circumstances of this case provide that the Petitioner

has received sufficient notice of the quit notice or of the eviction process. Thus, I cannot

assume that the quit notice P19 is defective or it has not been communicated to the

Petitioner. I am satisfied that no substantive prejudice has been caused to the Petitioner based

on the alleged objections under Section 3 of the Act as the learned Magistrate has not issued

any final order to evict the Petitioner up to date. The proceedings of the Magistrates Court

of Balangoda in case bearing No.84337 has been suspended by this Court until an order on

issuance of notice and interim relief is issued by this Court.

Another facet of the Petitioners argument is that the summons in reference to the said case

in the Magistrates Court of Balangoda were not duly served on the Petitioner. In light of my

above findings, I cannot assume that any substantial prejudice has been caused to the

Petitioner by not receiving such summons as pleaded in her Petition.

Competent Authority

Although the Petitioner has pleaded in her Petition that the 1st Respondent is not a Competent

Authority for the purpose of ejecting the Petitioner from the Land, no sufficient and lucid

submissions were made and no adequate material were placed before Court in order to

establish a viable legal ground for this Court to consider and make a determination upon the

said Competent Authority.

Conclusion

Having considered carefully the facts and circumstances of this case along with the principles

enunciated in the decisions of this Court and the Supreme Court on the State Lands (Recovery

Page 11 of 11

of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979, I am not inclined to issue formal notice of this Application

on the Respondents.

This Court in S. Ravindra Karunanayake vs. Attorney General & others, CA/Writ/63/2020

decided on 07.07.2020 has held;

"Whether there is an arguable ground for judicial review includes whether there is some properly

arguable vitiating flaw such as unlawfulness, unfairness, or unreasonableness. The vitiating

ground must be arguably material to the impugned decision. That decision must be arguably

amenable to judicial review see R v Chief Rabbi ex p. Wachmann (1992) 1 WLR 1036 at

1037H

This Court has also taken the view that in an application for judicial review, the Court should

consider whether the case is suitable for full investigation at a hearing at which all parties have

been given notice based on an arguable question. I see there is no appropriate question

available apart from the issues discussed above for this Court to examine even after issuing

formal notice on the Respondents.

Application is refused.
