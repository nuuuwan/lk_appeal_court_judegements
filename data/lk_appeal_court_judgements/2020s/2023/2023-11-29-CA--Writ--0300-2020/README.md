Before: M. T. Mohammed Laffar, J.

S. U. B. Karalliyadde, J.

Counsel:

Lakshman Perera P.C. with Upendra Walgampaya and Ms. L. Fernando for the Petitioners.

Thishya Weragoda with Ms. Thamali Rajapaksha and Ms. Ruchini Jayasinghe instructed by Thamali Dinushi Perera for 1st and 2nd Respondents.

Suranga Wimalasena, DSG for the 3rd Respondent.

Written submissions tendered on:

06.12.2020 by the Petitioners.

08.12.2022 by 1st and 2nd Respondents.

Argued on: 27.10.2022

Decided on: 29.11.2023

S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The 1st to 8th Petitioners are Upasampada Bhikkus of the Udarata Amarapura Sasana

Jothika Parshawaya allegedly belong to the Amarapura Nikaya. They obtained Higher

Ordination (Upasampada) on 26th June 2020 at an Upasampada ceremony held

according to the Buddhist Rules and Rituals and thereafter, they forwarded the

duplicates of the duly filed Upasampada Declarations in the prescribed form A of the

Schedule to the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance, No.19 of 1931 as amended by the

Act, No. 34 of 2013 (the Ordinance) marked as P-1 to P-8 to the Commissioner-General

of Buddhist Affairs (the Commissioner-General), the 3rd Respondent, in terms of

Section 41(2)(a) and 41(2)(b) of the Ordinance. The 3rd Respondent decided not to

4

register the Upasampada Declarations of the 1st to 8th Respondents for the reason that

the Udarata Amarapura Sasana Jothika Parshawaya has not been recognised as a

Chapter (Prashawaya) by the Amarapura Maha Nikaya and by letters dated 12.08.2020

marked as P-9 and P-9(a) to P-9(g) that decision has been conveyed to the Registrar

(Lekakadhikari) of the Udarata Amarapura Sasana Jothika Parshawaya (the 2nd

Respondent). Being aggrieved by the said decision of the 3rd Respondent the Petitioners

in this Writ Application seek the following substantive reliefs;

(b) Issue a mandate in the nature of the Writ of Certiorari quashing the purported

decisions of the 3rd Respondent contained in the documents marked P-9 and P-9(a) to

P-9(g).

(c) Issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus compelling the 3rd Respondent

to register the names of the 1st to 8th Petitioners as Upasampada Bhikkus under and in

terms of the Ordinance.

The position of the learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the Petitioners is that in

terms of Section 41(3) of the Ordinance, the 3rd Respondent is legally bound to register

the names of the Petitioners in the Register for the Registration of Upasampada Bhikkus

and send one copy of the duplicates of the same to the 1st and 2nd Respondents for due

registration. The learned Presidents Counsel argued that the 3rd Respondent is estopped

in law from refusing to register the Upasampada Declarations of the Petitioners as he

is not empowered by the provisions of the Ordinance to recognise and/or refuse to

recognise any Chapter.

5

The argument of the learned DSG appearing for the 3rd Respondent is that the

Ordinance only recognise the Nikaya and not Chapters (Parshawaya) and there is no

Parshawaya as Udarata Amarapura Sasana Jothika Parshawaya under the Amarapura

Maha Nikaya recognised by the Uththarithara Mahanayaka Thero of the Amarapura

Maha Nikaya according to the letter dated 22.06.2020 sent by the acting Mahanayaka

Thero of the Udaratra Amarapura Chapter to the 3rd Respondent (marked as R1).

Therefore, the learned DSG appearing for the 3rd Respondent argues that the refusal to

register the Petitioners as Upasampada Bhikkus were done in terms of the law.

The question that arises to decide in this Writ Application is, whether the 3rd

Respondent has the power to refuse the registration of Petitioners as Upasampada

Bhikkus in terms of Section 41(3) of the Ordinance. The Section 41(3) is read as

follows;

(3) The Commissioner-General of Buddhist Affairs shall on receiving the said forms

in duplicate retain one copy of each for his own use and forward the other to the

Mahanayaka Thera or Nayaka Thera of the nikaya mentioned therein, and it shall

be the duty of both the Commissioner-General of Buddhist Affairs and the said

Mahanayaka Thera or Nayaka Thera to file their respective copies of such forms

and make registers thereof. (Emphasis added)

In terms of Section 41(3) upon receipt of the forms of Upasampada Declarations it

shall be the duty of the Commissioner-General to retain one copy for his use and

6

forward the other copy to the Mahanayaka or Nayaka Thero of the Nikaya mentioned

in the Form and make a register thereof.

The word Shall is an imperative command, usually indicating that certain actions

are mandatory, and not permissive. Black's Law Dictionary 8th Edition at page 1407

defines the word shall as has a duty to; more broadly is required to.

In Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edition at page 284, citing R Vs.

Board of Trade, ex p. St. Martins Preserving Co. Ltd1, interpreting the word shall as

used in the United Kingdom Companies Act states that By section 164 of the

Companies Act 1948, the Board of Trade may appoint an inspector to investigate the

affairs of a company, while section 165 provides that the Board shall appoint one or

more competent inspectors in the circumstances there defined. It was held, contrasting

the permissive language of section 164, that where the specific circumstances occurred,

the Board was bound to appoint an inspector under section 165.

In the case of Mohamed Ali Sameed Smail Vs. Attorney General2, S. Thurairaja PC J.

has held that if in law the word shall is used it means that it must be complied with and

there is no discretion available to the person who is complying with the said law

In terms of Section 41(3) of the Ordinance the Commissioner-General upon receiving

the Upasampada form shall retain one copy and forward the other to the Mahanayaka

Thero or Nayaka Thero mentioned herein and it shall be the duty of the Commissioner-

1 [1965] 1 Q.B. 603.

2 Case No. CA/160/2015

General and the said Mahanayaka Thero or Nayaka Thero to file their respective copies

of such forms and make registers. Therefore, it should be given a

mandatory/compulsory meaning to Section 41(3) where, the Commissioner-General is

compelled to discharge without having the discretion to do otherwise he cannot

question the details mentioned in the Upasampada Declarations marked as P-1 to P-8.

Section 41(5) of the Ordinance has empowered Mahanayaka Thero or Nayake Thero of

a Nikaya to modify the entries by effecting corrections, additions or alterations in the

registries maintained by him in respect of Upasampada Bhikkus and Samaneras to keep

them updated. Upon communicating such modifications by the Mahanayaka Thero or

Nayake Thero, the Commissioner-General shall similarly modify the registers he is

required to keep by Section 41.

In the case of Maha Nayaka Thero of Malwatte Viharaya Vs. Registrar-General3, the

Mahanayaka Thero of the Malwatte Chapter requested the Registrar-General to make

the necessary modification under Section 41(5) of the Buddhist Temporalities

Ordinance regarding the removal of the name of one Thero from his register. The

Registrar-General refused to modify the register on the ground that the Ordinance does

not contemplate expulsion from priesthood and therefore, the Mahanayaka Thero filed

a Writ Application seeking a Writ of Mandamus against the decision of the Registrar-

General. It was held in that case that, the position taken up by the Registrar-General has

3 39 NLR 186.

8

no legal or logical justification and he is performing a ministerial act when he is acting

under Section 41(5) of the Ordinance. Therefore, he has no discretion and he cannot

question the validity of the decision of the Mahanayaka or the Sangha Sabha and he is

under a legal duty under Section 41(5) to remove the name of the Buddhist Priest from

the register on being requested by the Mahanayaka on the ground that the Priest has

been expelled from the order or to make the necessary alterations.

Further, in that case, Soertsz J. observed that;

I am therefore of the opinion that if the matter stood in this position, and no other

considerations arose, a clear case has been made out for the issue of a writ directing

the Registrar-General to modify his register. It is a duty the statute casts upon him

in imperative terms. It gives him no discretion and he is usurping functions he does

not possess when he acts in the manner in which he acted in this case. (Emphasis

added)

In Jain and Jain, The Principles of Administrative Law (1988) 4th Edition at page 325 it

is stated that;

"Functions dischargeable by the administration may either be ministerial or

discretionary. A ministerial function is one where the relevant law prescribes the duty

to be performed by the concerned authority in certain and specific terms leaving

nothing to the discretion or judgment of the authority. It does not involve investigation

into disputed facts or making of choices. The authority concerned acts in strict

9

obedience to the law which imposes on it a simple and definite duty in respect of which

it has no choice."

It is the view of this Court that, the Commissioner-General is performing a ministerial

act when he is acting under Section 41(3) of the Ordinance as well and therefore, has

no authority to refuse to register the Upasampada Declarations of the 1st 8th

Petitioners.

Under the above-stated circumstances, I hold that the decision of the 3rd Respondent

not to register the Upasampada Declarations of the 1st to 8th Respondents is illegal, ultra

vires and should be quashed. Therefore, I issue Writs as prayed for in prayers b and c

in the Petition. The 3rd Respondent should pay Rs. 5000/- each to the 1st 8th Petitioners

as costs of this Application.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL M.T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. I agree.
