Decided on: 31st March 2023

1. Prologue

In VASUDEVA NANAYAKKARA v CHOKSY AND OTHERS (JOHN KEELLS

CASE), the incumbent Chief Justice, with two other judges of the Supreme Court

said,

That the impugned transaction and the granting of benefits to John

Keells Holdings Ltd.; has been an arbitrary exercise of executive power

primarily on the part of the 8th respondent P.B. Jayasundera who

functioned at the relevant time as the Chairman of the Public Enterprise

Reform Commission.

The defence of time bar pleaded by the respondent must necessarily fail

since the impugned transfer was not conducted according to obtain

material documents from sources that were not accessible to him. This is

borne out by the fact that material documents P31 and P37 on which

significant findings have been made were obtained from the Board of

Investments after the applications was filed.

Accordingly, I overrule the objections based on locus standi and time bar

and grant to the petitioner the relief sought in prayer (b) of the petition

that there has been an infringement of the fundamental right guaranteed

by Article 12(1) of the Constitution by executive or administrative action.

Ordinarily, the grant of a declaration that executive or administrative

action is an infringement of the fundamental right guaranteed by Article

12(1) would result in a restoration of the status quo ante. However, since

the jurisdiction vested in this Court in terms of Article 126(4) of the

3 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

Constitution is to grant relief or to make directions as it may seem just

and equitable, it is open to the Court to ascertain whether the implications

of the impugned executive action are severable. On a careful survey of the

findings I am of the view, that the Presidential Grant of the land 8 Acres 2

Roods 21.44 Perches which is within the declared limits of the Port of

Colombo; the grant of investment relief by the Board of Investments to

Lanka Marine Services Ltd., resulting inter alia in relief from the payment

of taxes that are due and, the entering into of the Common Users Facility

Agreement with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority are severable from the sale

of shares. Accordingly, I allow the relief prayed for in prayer (g), (h) and (i)

of the prayer to the petition and declare the Presidential Grant marked P31

as null and void. The 18th, 19th, 20th and 21 st respondents will vacate

the land within one month from today and restore possession to Sri Lanka

Ports Authority. The Common User Facility Agreement dated 20.08.2002

(P19(a)) is declared null and void and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority may

enter into fresh Agreements for the use of facilities within the Port on equal

terms with all parties licensed to supply bunkers.

All agreements entered into between the Board of Investment and

Lanka Marine Services Ltd., are declared null and void and the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue is directed to recover all

taxes due on the basis that such Agreements have not been in force.

In view of the foregoing orders I do not consider it necessary or just and

equitable to make an order as regards the sale of shares per se.

The findings in the judgment demonstrate that the action of P.B.

Jayasundera, 8th respondent has not only been arbitrary and ultra vires

but also biased in favour of John Keells Holdings Ltd., The allegation of

the petitioner that he worked in collusion with S. Ratnayake of John Keells

to secure illegal advantages to the latter, adverse to the public interest is

established. Accordingly I direct the 8th respondent pay a sum of Rs.

500,000/- as compensation to the State.

The 18th to 21st respondents will pay the petitioner a sum of Rs.

250,000/- as costs.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue who is not a party to these

proceedings to take action as directed above.

All parties to the proceedings will take necessary action on the basis of the

findings stated above.

The application is allowed.

The above judgment was dated 21.07.2008.

On 08.10.2008, the court ordered the 08th Respondent Jayasundera to file an

affidavit stating that he will not hold any office in any governmental institution

either directly or indirectly or purport to exercise in any manner executive or

administrative function.

An affidavit in this respect was filed in court on 16.10.2008.

After the retirement of the said Chief Justice in June 2009, Jayasundera filed S.

C. (F. R.) 209/2007, a further Application in the same case No. 209/2007, which

was titled Vasudeva Nanayakkara vs. Choksy and others And Now between

Dr. P. B. Jayasundera vs. The Attorney General (John Keels case No. 2),

which was heard by 07 judges of the Supreme Court presided by the succeeding

Chief Justice in which the judgment was delivered on 13.10.2009.

J.A.N. de Silva, C. J. and Balapatabendi J., held, among other things,

(1) An order to file an affidavit, the contents of which are the dictates of

Court amounts to an order made in excess of jurisdiction and as such the

5 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

validity of the document becomes an issue. Accordingly, the Petitioner is

not bound by its contents.

Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake J., held, among other things,

(1) A citizen of the Republic of Sri Lanka has a fundamental right to

engage in a lawful occupation and such right is guaranteed in terms of

Article 14 (1) of the Constitution. Any restriction would only be based on

the disciplinary procedure in terms of his employment.

Saleem Marsoof J., held, among other things,

(1) The most important characteristic of an affidavit is its voluntary

nature, and there can be no doubt that no Court will act on an affidavit

that has been extracted with coercion. The onus would he on the person

asserting duress or coercion to show that the threat of harm was so

immediate and proximate that it deprived the affidavit of its voluntary

character.

Sripavan J., held, among other things,

(1) It is a fundamental principle that no Bench is empowered to enlarge

the ambit and scope of the judgment or punishment imposed by a previous

Bench, [nothing is to be implied and no inferences could be drawn from

the judgment. One has to look fairly at the language used in the final

judgment, or otherwise the door will be opened for unfettered conclusions

being reached.]

Ratnayake J., held, among other things,

(1) In the absence of the explicit order in the journal entry of 8 th October

2008 to the effect that the 8 th Respondent - Petitioner was ordered by the

Supreme Court not to hold "any office in any Government institution either

directly or indirectly or purport to exercise in any manner executive or

administrative function" as described by the 8 th Respondent - Petitioner

6 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

in paragraph "a" of the amended petition, the necessity to vacate such an

order dated 8 th October 2008 does not arise. Indeed all that the journal

entry dated 8 th October 2008 stated was that the Respondent - Petitioner

"may consider" filing an affidavit in which he may make a statement to the

effect that he would not hold any office in any Governmental institution

either directly or indirectly. . . . The use of the words "may consider" in the

said journal entry makes it unambiguously clear that the making of such

statement in the affidavit was optional on the part of the 8"'Respondent

Petitioner.

Shiranee Thilakawardene J., (dissenting) held, among other things,

An affidavit cannot he retracted from the record once it is filed in Court.

Any retraction on the evidence given by affidavit will entail similar

consequences a s going back on ora(1) The Supreme Court's divisions are

a product of administrative expediency and nothing more, and in the light

of Section 114 (d) presumption under the Evidence Ordinance - which

presumes that judicial acts have been regularly performed - the suggestion

that a change in composition of a particular Bench itself somehow

extinguishes jurisdiction, is proved to be patently incorrect.

(2) The prayer to vacate an Order is a re-visitation of a judgment by the

Supreme Court, and in this case by a Bench differing in composition than

the one which issued the Order. Therefore, we are precluded from being

able to take such action.

(3) In the light of the judgment in "Jeyaraj Femandopulle v. Prernachandra

Silva and Others" when the Supreme Court has decided a matter, that

matter is at an end, and there is no occasion for other Judges to be called

upon to review or revise a matter. To grant relief of the type that reverses

a prior judgment of the Supreme Court is untenable and has no basis in

Law.

(4) An affidavit is a solemn declaration of the truth of the facts stated

therein made by a person from his personal knowledge and is evidence

given on oath for the purpose of being relied on and acted upon and

therefore it cannot withdrawn.

l evidence. The consequence of any person who willfully and dishonestly

swears or affirms falsely, to facts contained in an affidavit, would be guilty

of making a false statement of Court, which attracts penal consequences.

By a majority decision of 6 to 1, the Supreme Court granted relief sought under

paragraph (c) of the petition.

The above is the effect of John Keels Case No. 1 and John Keels Case No. 2.

2. Steps Taken Thereafter

It is stated in paragraphs 1 to 3 of written submissions of the Appellant,

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, dated 13.08.2018, as follows,

1. The primary question of law for the opinion of Your Lordships Court

in this Case Stated is whether the Tax Appeals Commission erred in

interpreting the Supreme Court judgments in Vasudeva Nanayakkara vs.

K. N. Choksey and 30 others, S.C. F. R., 209/2007 dated 21 July 2008

and 13 October 2009.

2. In brief, the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (the Appellant)

took steps against the respondent, Lanka Marine Services, pursuant to a

direction of the Supreme Court in its judgment dated 21st July 2008

(original judgment). As the original judgment had directed the appellant

to take the necessary steps to recover taxes after disregarding the

agreement the respondent had entered into with the Board of Investment,

the appellant proceeded to do so. The time bar was disregarded in view of

the express direction of the Supreme Court.

8 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

3. The Tax Appeals Commission (TAC), however, appears to have held

that the Supreme Court decision in the subsequent order issued pursuant

to Dr. P. B. Jayasunderas application delivered on 13th October 2009

(subsequent order) had set aside all findings of the original judgment.

As the subsequent order does no such thing, it would appear that the TAC

has mistakenly relied upon some other unknown order. The TAC allowed

the appeal on the preliminary issue of time bar, based on such erroneous

premise.

Without saying, perhaps in jest, that, the TAC has mistakenly relied upon some

other unknown order, it could have been said that the interpretation of the order

dated 13th October 2009 by the TAC was erroneous, in that, the said subsequent

order did not set aside the findings of the judgment dated 21st July 2008. What

it set aside was not the judgment dated 21st October 2008, but the subsequent

order in respect of Jayasundera holding government office dated 10th October

2008.

Hence the original order or actually the judgments directions that tax should be

recovered from the Lanka Marine Services Limited, as if the prohibition in the

Board of Investment agreement did not operate, is in force.

What took place after the delivery of the judgment dated 21st July 2008, is stated

in paragraphs 12 to 21 of the above written submissions of the Appellant, as

follows,

12. Upon receipt of the direction contained in the original judgment, the

appellant wrote to the respondent by letter dated 01st August 2008

requesting early submission of the relevant tax computations and payment

schemes.

13. The appellant also sought the opinion of the Attorney General by letter

dated 22nd August 2008, as to whether an assessment could be

maintained in respect of taxable periods 2002/03, 2003/04 and 2004/05

9 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

as the time for assessment for those periods had already lapsed in terms

of section 134(5) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000.

[This is incorrect, because on 31st March 2005, the second proviso to

section 134(5) was amended to say at any time after the end of that

year of assessment.

14. By letter dated 05th December 2008, the Attorney General having

considered the original judgment and the relevant law, informed the

appellant that there is no legal bar against the recovery of taxes from the

respondent for the taxable period 2002/03, 2003/04 and 2004/05.

15. By three separate letters dated 10th December 2008, the respondent

was informed that it had failed to furnish the tax computation requested

and that the returns submitted by it for the taxable periods 2002/03,

2003/04 and 2004/05 respectively were rejected. Accordingly, Notices of

Assessment dated 07th January 2009 were issued for the said periods.

16. The respondent appealed against the said Notices of Assessment by its

letters dated 26th January 2009. The objections included a time bar

objection and other substantive objections.

17. After considering the representations made by the respondent, the

appellant decided to recover Rs. 129 million immediately and hold over the

balance tax assessed pending settlement of the appeals. This decision was

intimated to the respondent by letter dated 24th April 2009.

18. By written submissions dated 14th June 2010 and 05th July 2010, the

respondent raised a preliminary objection on the basis that the

assessments were time barred. The respondent subsequently filed written

submissions dated 09th August 2010 on the substantive issues as well.

The principle substantive issue involved the question of whether the

supply of bunker fuel could be considered an export and as such exempt

in terms of section 15 or subject to the special rate of tax under section 47

of the Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000.

19. By decision dated 03rd December 2010, the appellant confirmed the

assessments. The reasons for the determination were issued on 10th

December 2010. The taxes for the respective years of assessment were

determined as follows:-

Year of Assessment Assessable Income (Rs.) Tax (Rs.)

2002/2003 495,941,863 85,837,219

2003/2004 365,710,433 118,855,891

2004/2005 698,212,965 226,919,214

20. The respondent appealed to the Board of Review under section 138(3)

of the Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000 on 04th January 2011 against

the decision of the appellant. The respondent filed written submissions

dated 17th December 2013 and the appellant filed written submissions

dated 05th December 2013.

21. The TAC after hearing the parties made its decision on 05th August

2014, allowing the appeal on the preliminary matter of time bar on the

basis that the original judgment of the Supreme Court was completely

reversed by the subsequent appointment of a fuller Bench of seven

Supreme Court Judges presided over by the succeeding Chief Justice

Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, which Court was required to consider the

earlier judgment and the fuller Bench in fact set aside all findings of

the earlier court.

This was a completely wrong interpretation of the subsequent order dated 13th

October 2009. The seven Judge Bench was not presided by Dr. Shirani

Bandaranayake and she was not the Chief Justice. This shows that the TAC has

not read the subsequent order. The said order did not reverse the judgment dated

11 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

21st July 2008 except for the direction [which too was not in the judgment but on

the subsequent order dated 08th October 2008 in a journal entry] in respect of

Jayasundera holding a government post.

The appellant wanted a case stated to be referred to this Court. It contained two

questions of law, which are,

(1) Has the TAC erred in interpreting the Supreme Court judgment dated 21st

July 2008, in a Fundamental Rights application filed in the same court

bearing No. S. C. F. R. 209/2007?

(2) Has the TAC misread some other judgment in interpreting Supreme Court

judgment No. S. C. (F. R.) 209/2007 and dated 21st July 2008?

3. Preliminary jurisdictional objection

In written submissions dated 13th August 2018 filed by the respondent, a

preliminary objection has been taken up in respect of the jurisdiction of this

Court.

It basically contains in paragraphs 6 to 18 of the said written submissions

which are as follows,

6. It is the respondents position that Your Lordships Court does not

possess the jurisdiction to answer the above questions of law since these

questions of law do not impinge upon the assessment. Assuming, without

conceding, that the above two questions of law are answered in the

appellants favour it would still have no impact on the amount

assessed which relates to the income tax liability of the respondent.

The primary purpose of the appellants appeal in this instance has been to

challenge the legality of the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission.

The appellant does not invoke the jurisdiction of Your Lordships Court

with the intention of annulling the assessment. In the event that the

appellant sought to annul the assessment or sought any other relief

12 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

contemplated by section 11A (6) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No.

23 of 2011 (as amended), it could invoke the jurisdiction of Your Lordships

Court by way of a Stated Case.

7. It is submitted that Your Lordships Court does not have the jurisdiction

to quash the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission on an appeal

on a question of law in a Stated Case. The jurisdiction in such cases is

limited to giving effect to the Courts opinion on questions of law that

impact upon the amount assessed. The proper remedy in the

circumstances, available to the appellant, would have been to come by way

of judicial review so as to invoke the constitutional writ jurisdiction of Your

Lordships Court for the purpose of quashing the decision of the Tax

Appeals Commission.

8. In any event, it is the respondents respectful submission that the above

questions of law are not fit and proper questions to be determined by Your

Lordships Court by way of a Stated Case appeal.

9. The Tax Appeals Commission has made a determination based on the

preliminary objection raised by the taxpayer and the appellant in the

appeal before the Tax Appeals Commission (i.e., the Respondent in the

instant appeal)

10. It is trite law that a jurisdictional issue can be raised before a statutory

tribunal.

11. H. W. R. Wade and C. F. Forsyth, in their well known work,

Administrative Law [Oxford:- Oxford University Press, 11th edition, 2014],

explain that a statutory tribunal is lawfully entitled to examine a

jurisdictional issue that has been raised before it. They state, at page 210,

as follows,

Where a jurisdictional question is disputed before a tribunal, the

tribunal must necessarily decide it. If it refuses to do so, it is

13 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

wrongfully declining jurisdiction and the court will order it to act

properly. Otherwise the tribunal or other authority would be able to

weild an absolute despotic power, which the legislature never

intended that it should exercise. It follows that the question is within

the tribunals own jurisdiction, but with this difference, that the

tribunals decision about it cannot be conclusive.

12. Wade and Forsyth clearly supports the proposition that a tribunal is

fully entitled to decide a jurisdictional question that has been raised before

it. However if the tribunal has got its answer to the jurisdictional question

wrong this matter could be canvassed in an application for judicial review

or by way of appeal. This position has now been accepted by the Court of

Appeal in Commissioner General of Inland Revenue vs. Koggala Garments

(Pvt.) Ltd., C.A. Tax 1/2008 and affirmed by the Supreme Court.

13. In the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue vs. Koggala

Garments (Pvt) Limited, C. A. Tax 1/2008, Nawaz J., explains the

applicable law, at page 8 9 of his judgment in the following terms:-

The argument is that the Board of Review could not have considered

the jurisdictional objection

I hasten to point out that the law is to the contrary. H. W. R. Wade and C.

F. Forsyth in their well known tome, Administrative Law [Oxford:- Oxford

University Press, 11th Edition 2014] explain that a statutory tribunal is

lawfully entitled to examine a jurisdictional issue that has been raised

before it. They state at page 210, as follows,

Where a jurisdictional question is disputed before a tribunal, the

tribunal must necessarily decide it. If it refuses to do so, it is

wrongfully declining jurisdiction and the court will order it to act

properly. Otherwise the tribunal or other authority would be able to

weild an absolute despotic power, which the legislature never

intended that it should exercise. It follows that the question is within

the tribunals own jurisdiction, but with this difference, that the

tribunals decision about it cannot be conclusive.

Wade and Forsyth clearly support the proposition that a tribunal is fully

entitled to decide a jurisdictional question that has been raised before it.

However, if the tribunal has got its answer to the jurisdictional question

wrong, it is open to the aggrieved party to canvass the wrong answer on

jurisdiction by way of judicial review.

It may be noted, that, Wade does not say that judicial review is the only way of

canvassing the order. This question will be examined in due course. The

respondents written submissions continued,

14. The judgment of the Court of Appeal was affirmed by the Supreme

Court on 04th May 2018 in Commissioner General of Inland Revenue vs.

Koggala Garments (Private) Limited, C. A. Application S. C. Spl L. A.

114/2017, when the Supreme Court refused the petitioner, Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue, Special Leave to Appeal against the judgment

of the Court of Appeal.

15. In Commissioner General of Inland Revenue vs. Koggala Garments

(Private) Limited., C. A. Tax 01/2008, decided by the Court of Appeal on

05th April 2017, Your Lordships Court held that, if the question of law

stated to this court does not arise on the assessments, this court is

denuded of jurisdiction to hear and determine that question of law. (per

Nawaz J., with Malalgoda P/CA agreeing, at page 10 of the judgment).

The question arises, that, if the Court of Appeal being a superior court of record

has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the preliminary objection, in respect

of its jurisdiction, how could the TAC being an inferior tribunal could have

heard and determined the same. The tribunal of the Tax Appeals Commission

doing this was supported by citing Wade in paragraph 13 above that it is a

15 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

must and if the tribunal refuses to do so the court will order to act properly.

Will not the same logic apply to the Court of Appeal, when the Court of Appeal

is confronted with the same preliminary objection? If not, it will be an anomaly

of law, to say the least.

The said written submission continued,

16. Assuming that the appellant, Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue succeeds in his appeal by having the questions of law answered

in his favour, this would not result in the amount of tax assessed being

confirmed since the substantive issues raised in the taxpayers appeal

have not been considered by the Tax Appeals Commission.

17. It is the respondents position that the questions of law raised by the

appellant have no logical nexus or connection with the assessment. It is

further submitted that even if both the questions of law are answered in

favour of the appellant, it would have absolutely no bearing on the

assessment.

18. Article 138 of the Constitution provides as follows:-

138(1) The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the

provisions of the constitution or any other law, an appellate jurisdiction

for the correction of all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed

by any Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution and sole and

exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum,

of all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things of which

such Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution may have taken

justice.

(2)The Court of Appeal shall also have and exercise all such powers and

jurisdiction, appellate and original, as Parliament may by law vest and

ordain.

Then it is cited the case of Martin vs. Wijewardane, [1989] 2 SLR 409, decided

under the Agrarian Services Act to say that Article 138(1) will not grant a right

of appeal.

4. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue vs. Koggala Garments

Limited

At this stage, it is pertinent to examine as to what the Koggala Garments Limited

case says.

It said, The determination of the Board of Review does not deal with the

assessments that were before the Board and it was fairly and squarely a decision

on time bar.

Koggala Garments (Private) Limited, the Appellant before the

Board of Review raised the following objections in limine when its appeal

was taken up..

(li) The first proviso to Section 140(10) of the Inland Revenue Act, No 38 of

2000 (as amended by Section 52 of Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No

37 of 2003), makes it imperative that the Board of Review arrives at its

determination within two years from the commencement of the hearing of

the appeal. Consequently, since this two year period has lapsed the appeal

must be deemed to have been allowed and the Board of Review is functus

officio as far as the appeal made by this Appellant is concerned".

. The Board of Review upheld the second preliminary objection

and allowed the taxpayer's appeal.

.. In fact the argument is to the effect that the Board cannot

even consider the question of time bar and rule on its jurisdiction. If one

looks at the question of law (h), it suggests that questions of law cannot

be gone into at all by the Board of Review. The words in the question of

law (h) " ...... it cannot assume jurisdiction it does not possess to decide

on questions of law .. " are also supplemented by the written submissions

of the Appellant dated 20.02.2017 wherein it is stated in paragraph 21

that "it is respectfully submitted that the jurisdiction of the Board of

Review is limited to confirming, reducing, increasing or annulling the

assessment as determined by the Commissioner-General on appeal or

else, to remit it to the Commissioner General for the revision of the

assessment. It is therefore respectfully submitted that the Board of Review

does not have the power to entertain and/or deal with questions of law

challenging the jurisdiction of the Board of Review itself on the basis of a

time bar which the Appellant alleges denudes the jurisdiction of the

Board."

Hence, in Koggala Garments Limited, itself, in 2017, the argument was raised,

that even the Board of Review cannot consider the question of time bar.

5. Jurisdiction of the Board of Review, Tax Appeals Commission and the

Court of Appeal

The Board of Review, as it appears to this court, had the same limitations

as the respondent now argues, that, this court has. Both the Board of Review

and this court, under relevant sections could confirm, reduce, increase or annul

the assessment or else remit the case to the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue for the revision of the assessment. Hence the argument of this court is

that if the Board of Review [the tribunal] could have considered a question of

time bar, notwithstanding the above section, this court too can hear the said

jurisdictional objection in a stated case under section 11(A) (6) of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act, which is similar in import.

What is the jurisdiction of the Board of Review in an appeal that comes from the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue?

18 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

The Board of Review was established by section 98 of the Inland Revenue Act No.

4 of 1963.

Section 99 said,

99. Any appellant, or the authorized representative of any appellant,

who is dissatisfied with the determination of an appeal under section 97,

may, by petition in writing addressed to the Board, appeal from that

determination within one month from the date of the notice of the

determination..

Section 97 was appeals to the Commissioner. Hence from an appeal to the

Commissioner of Inland Revenue, the taxpayer could appeal to the Board of

Review.

What could the Board of Review do with such an appeal?

Section 101(9) said,

(9) After hearing the appeal, the Board shall confirm, reduce,

increase, or annul the assessment as determined by the

Commissioner on appeal, or as referred by him under section 100, as the

case may be, or may remit the case to the Commissioner with the

opinion of the Board thereon. Where a case is so remitted by the

Board, the Commissioner shall revise the assessment as the opinion of the

Board may require.

The Board of Review was replaced by the Tax Appeals Commission Act No. 23 of

2011. Section 7 provides for an appeal to the TAC from the determination of the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue.

What can the TAC do with such an appeal?

In section 9(10) of the TAC Act it is provided,

19 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

After hearing the evidence, the Commission shall on appeal confirm,

reduce, increase or annul, as the case may be, the assessment as

determined by the Commissioner General or may remit the case to the

Commissioner General with the decision of the Commission on such

appeal. Where a case is so remitted by the Commission, the Commissioner

General shall revise the assessment in order that it is in conformity with

such amount as stated in the decision of the Commission.

This is the same thing the Court of Appeal is empowered to do when it hears a

case stated on questions of law. Section 11(A) (6) of the Tax Appeals Commission

Act says,

Any two or more Judges of the Court of Appeal may hear and determine

any question of law arising on the stated case and may in accordance with

the decision of the Court upon such question, confirm, reduce, increase

and annul the assessment determined by the Commission, or may remit

the case to the Commission with the opinion of the Court, thereon.

Where a case is so remitted by the Court, the Commission shall revise the

assessment in accordance with the opinion of the Court.

So, on an appeal, the Board of Review, the Tax Appeals Commission and the

Court of Appeal have been asked to do the same thing.

The respondent to support its contention that the Board of Review can, nay that

it must, hear the jurisdictional question of time bar, the court in Koggala

Garments Limited cited Wade, quoted under paragraph 13 of the said written

submissions quoted above. The argument of this court is that if Wade in that

paragraph is applicable to an inferior tribunal why not it apply, with the same,

or even more force to this court? What is good for the Goose is good for the

Gander.

6. The characteristics of a Case Stated

This court is aware of the fact that what comes from the Commissioner General

to the Board of Review [or Tax Appeals Commission] is an appeal whereas what

comes to this court is a case stated. But the side note of section 7 of Tax Appeals

Commission Act says Right to appeal to the CommissionThe side note in

section 11(A) is Appeals on a question of law to the Court of Appeal.

In deciding upon the question, what is a case stated, it is pertinent to refer to

the following material, which includes decided cases from this country as well as

other jurisdictions.

First we shall consider a case from New Zealand. The case is IN THE MATTER

OF An appeal by way of case stated from the determination of the Social

Security Appeal Authority at Wellington, DAVID OWEN CREQUER Appellant

vs. THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE MINISTRY OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT

Respondent, decided on 09th July 2015.

The High Court of New Zealand at Christchurch said, under the topic The case

stated regime,

The law is always guided by context. It is therefore useful to

contextualise the concept of cases stated. I think it valuable to first

traverse the genesis of cases stated. In this respect, Gordons article

provides an invaluable starting point.10 In introducing the topic, Gordon

provides the following resume of the procedures history:11

Judges have been given to asserting that a stated case, i.e one stated

by a magistrate or magistrates, is a purely statutory remedy. That

statement seems to be seriously misleading. It is true that the type of

stated case now invariably used is of statutory origin. But the

assertion as usually made implies that stated cases were unknown

to the common law, which is decidedly wrong.

21 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

In the past, not only did justices state cases for several centuries at

common law, but for a short time after statutory stated cases were created

by the Summary Jurisdiction Act 1857, both statutory and common law

cases were in use at the same time. The common law stated case was in

no sense an appeal; it operated through the machinery of certiorari

proceedings to quash. A case stated under the Act of 1857 began to take

on the properties of an appeal, since the Act dispensed with the need for a

certiorari to bring the case before the superior court.

As to these common law species of cases stated, Gordon divides them into

two categories. Helpfully, the latter bears resemblance to the procedure

currently before the Court:12

It should be mentioned that two types of cases were stated by justices

at common law. Justices stated one type of case during the

course of a hearing before them; they set out the facts that

raised a legal problem, and that statement was sent before the

Assize judges for solution. The judges opinion was returned to the

justices, who then completed their hearing and adjudicated in the

light of that opinion.

The other type of stated case was stated after the justices had

made their conviction or order. If a legal problem had arisen on

which they had felt difficulty, they could state the facts and the

problem in the form of an appendix to their conviction or order, and it

was then brought up as part of the record by a certiorari. Then the

Queens Bench quashed or affirmed the adjudication brought up,

according as they agreed or disagreed with the justices legal rulings.

As to the purpose of such a mechanism, it is quite straight forward. It

stems from a desire to ensure that the legal interpretation of inferior

Courts and tribunals is correct. As Beck remarks:13

22 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

Sometimes a point of law arises in proceedings not before the High

Court where it would be wasteful to go through the whole process of

appeal of review. Part 21 HCR makes provision for the court to be

consulted on a point of law where this is authorised by a statute. The

empowering statute governs the nature and purpose of cases that

may be stated for the courts opinion; the rules determine the

procedure to be adopted.

Informed by this history, I think today it is safe to say that the case stated

procedure is simply a species of appeal that is narrow in compass.

However, it has been said that:14

In theory, a case stated appeal is not an appeal in the ordinary sense of

the word but a form of consultation by a tribunal with the Court in order

to obtain an answer on a point of law.

Ordinarily the ability to state a case will be confined to questions of law.

That is not a panoptic statement, of course; as with many facets of our

law, there are exceptions. But, the general position is accurately captured

in Conroy v Patterson, where Henry J stated:15

On an appeal by way of case stated on a point of law only the Court

is concerned with the relevant facts as found and the grounds for

determining the particular question of law, which question itself must

be properly stated. The Supreme Court is not further or otherwise

concerned with the evidence or the other findings which were made.

In my respectful opinion, the position is correctly stated by Paull J. in

McGee v George (1964) 108 S.J. 119, where the learned Judge says

that the object of appeal by way of case stated is that the Court should

look only at the case as stated and the facts as found.

Hence, although the New Zealand High Court said it is a species of appeal that

is narrow in compass, it asserted that it is a form of consultation, not only at

23 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

the end of the determination by the lower tribunal, but also during the course

of a hearing before them. Since the Tax Appeals Commission has not, in the

present case, decided on the assessment, but only on a preliminary point, it can

be considered as during the course of a hearing before them. The dicta of the

New Zealand case therefore shows, that, there is no jurisprudential objection for

a Case Stated to come to this Court on such a question of law.

Vijith K. Malalgoda J., [with Justices Murdu N. B. Fernando and E. A. G. R.

Amerasekera agreeing] also had the occasion to pronounce upon a Case Stated

in Commissioner General of Inland Revenue vs. Janashakthi Insurance

Company Limited, SC. Appeal No. 114/2019, C.A (Tax) Appeal No. 10/2013.

His Lordship said at page 09 and 10 of the judgment,

In addition to the statutory provisions found in the TAC Act, our

Appellate Courts too have considered the process before the Court of

Appeal in a case stated and opined that the Court of Appeals power in

considering the questions of law is not restricted to the questions

identified in the case stated, but the Court is permitted to consider new

questions of law agreed upon by the court, if the answers to new questions

of law may result in the confirmation, reduction, increasing or annulling

the assessment determined by the Commission.

In this regard I am mindful of the dicta of Abrahams C.J., in

Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Sarverimuttu Ratty (Report of

Ceylon Tax Case, Vol 1 page 103 at 109 to the effect,

Incidentally there was no reference to us on this point by the Board

of Review, since that point was not put to the Board when they were

called upon to adjudicate in appeal, but we are not, of cause

precluded from considering any point upon which the actual

decision of the Board might be upheld, no matter what might

have been their reasons for arriving at that decision

24 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

Although Justice Malalgoda has referred to the confirmation, reduction,

increasing or annulling the assessment, the authority His Lordship refers to, of

Sir Sydney Abrahams, the Chief Justice proves the wider scope of a Case

Stated, which the learned Chief Justice made, in respect of a Case Stated from

the Board of Review similar to in this case. Hence this Court has power to

consider about the question of time bar, considered by the Board of Review or

the Tax Appeals Commission, in this Case Stated.

In The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue vs. Dr. S.S.L. Perera

CA/TAX/03/2017 Justice Janak de Silva referring to the question of a Case

Stated said at page 05 and 06,

Section 11A (6) of the TAC Act reads:

"Any two or more Judges of the Court of Appeal may hear and determine

any question of law arising on the stated case and may in accordance with

the decision of Court upon such question, confirm, reduce, increase or

annul the assessment determined by the Commission, or may remit the

case to the Commission with the opinion of the Court, thereon." (emphasis

added).

The words "hear and determine any question of law arising on the stated

case" appeared in section 74(5} of the Income Tax Ordinance No 2 of 1932

and was interpreted by Basnayake e.J. in R.M. Fernando v. Commissioner

of Income Tax (Supra. at 577) to mean that it requires the Court to hear

and determine any questions of law arising on the stated case and not any

question or questions formulated by the Board. Previously in M.P. Silva v.

Commissioner of Income Tax (Reports of Ceylon Tax Cases, Vol. I, page

336 at 338) Canekeratne J. having considered section 74(5} of the Income

Tax Ordinance No 2 of 1932 held that "all questions that could be raised

on the whole case was intended to be left open". The learned Judge chose

to follow the dicta in Ushers Wiltshire Brewery v. Bruce [(1915) A.C. 433

at 465,466].

25 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

Since his lordship said at page 07,

Accordingly, I hold that it is open for this Court to consider questions of

law other than what is set out in the case stated. However, I wish to state

that such a course of action is permissible only if the answers to the new

questions of law may result in the confirmation, reduction, increasing or

annulling the assessment determined by the Commission, or requires the

remitting of the case to the TAC with the opinion of the Court,

it shows that if the considering of the question results in remitting of the case to

the Tax Appeals Commission too, the question can be considered.

As the New Zealand High Court decision of 2015 clearly shows that in a Case

Stated the superior court can consider interim questions, such as time bar

questions and also final determinations on facts, which is akin to a

consultation, if this Court cannot decide the jurisdictional issue on a Case

Stated it is like consulting a higher court and say, you may only speak about

this and no other. In that way, it is not the Case Stated but the writ, which

is limited.

In deciding this question, in respect of the self same Koggala Garments Limited

case, in The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue vs. Janashakthi

General Insurance Co. Ltd., C. A. Tax 14/2013 decided on 20th May 2020,

Justice Janak de Silva, [Justice N. Bandula Karunarathne agreeing] said at page

09, that,

Furthermore, given that the established position is that a tribunal

exceeds its jurisdiction if it makes any error of law [Anisminic Ltd v.

Foreign Compensation Commission (1969) 2 A.C. 147], statutory appeal

procedure will be made redundant in the event it is held that jurisdictional

questions cannot be raised in such appeal procedure.

The Court of Appeal said at page 10,

26 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

Let me give an example. A case before the TAC raises the question of

whether the assessment is time barred in addition to substantive issues.

The TAC decides to take up the time bar issue as a preliminary objection

as raised by the taxpayer. If the TAC overrules [This should be upholds]

the preliminary objection then we are told, by the second part quoted from

Koggala Garment case (supra), that the taxpayer must resort to judicial

review as the TAC has not looked at the substantive issues. Yet if the

taxpayer [This should be Commissioner General of Inland Revenue]

succeeds in its challenge on time bar of assessment, then it is in relation

to a matter arising on the assessment and, we are told by the first part of

the quotation in Koggala Garment case (supra), the Commissioner General

of Inland Revenue can move for a Case Stated to be referred to this Court.

Dr. Sivaji Felix at the oral argument said that the above passage is contradictory.

But it gives meaning, when the confusion between overrules the preliminary

objection is corrected as upholding the preliminary objection and if the

taxpayer succeeds is corrected as if the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue succeeds.

The Court of Appeal also said at page 11,

As explained above, applying the ratio in Koggala Garment case (supra)

creates situations where if a preliminary issue is answered in favour of one

party, the aggrieved party must resort to judicial review, which is

discretionary, whereas if it is answered in favour of the other

party, the aggrieved party may submit a Case Stated which is available

as of right. Secondly, such a situation is in any event contrary to public

policy since it results in two different procedures for two types of parties

arising from the same decision.

Hence, with the greatest of the respect, this court is unable to agree with the

reasoning of the Koggala Garments Limited case, that, the appropriate procedure

27 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

for a party aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Review or Tax Appeals

Commission on a time bar question, is to prefer an application on judicial review.

It was also decided in The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue vs.

Janashakthi General Insurance Col. Ltd C.A. Tax 14/2013 that,

The learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that the judgment of

this Court in Koggala Garment case (supra) was affirmed by the Supreme

Court on 04.05.2018 in Commissioner General of Inland Revenue v.

Koggala Garments (Private) Limited [S.C. Spl. L.A. Application No.

114/2017] when the Supreme Court refused special leave to appeal.

However, in B.M. Karunadasa, Asst. Commissioner of Labour v. W.

Balasuriya, Sports of Kings [CA (PHC) APN 97/2010, C.A.M. 17.07.2013]

Salam J. (with Rajapakse J. agreeing) held that it is a misconception to

come to the conclusion that the refusal of leave by the Supreme Court

constitutes the affirmation of the judgment of the lower court and cannot

be considered as creating a precedent.

This Court while agreeing with the above view, respectfully submits, that the

Supreme Court refusing leave is a refusal to exercise appellate jurisdiction and

jurisprudentially it is different to the Supreme Court confirming the judgment

appealed having given reasons.

In paragraph 22 of the above written submissions, the respondent, has analysed

section 11A (6) which grants jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal, which will be

considered later.

In the case of R. M. Fernando vs. Commissioner of Income Tax (1959)

Reports of Ceylon Tax cases (1960 edition) 652 at 660, which is cited in

paragraph 24 of the said written submissions, Basnayake C. J., has said that

the Board of Review should not state abstract or hypothetical questions. But the

question of time bar arises in this case is neither.

28 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

The case cited at paragraph 26 of the said written submissions is Navaratnam

vs. Commissioner of Income Tax (1949) Reports of Ceylon Tax cases (1960

edition) 431, in which, it was said that where there is no tax in dispute the

question of law was one of pure academic interest and there is no right of appeal.

But in the present case, the questions of law raised by the appellant decide the

question whether the Board of Review has come to the correct decision with

regard to the judgment dated 27.07.2008 and subsequent order dated

13.10.2009 in the John Keels Case Nos. 1 and 2, which is not academic.

What the respondent cites at paragraph 29, Thomas vs. Ingram (Inspector of

Taxes) [1979] STC 1, says, among other things,

It would in my view be quite impossible for me to resolve any such

questions as the taxpayer has now raised as to the propriety of the conduct

of the proceedings before the commissioners without full evidence as to

what transpired. The leading of evidence of that sort is plainly not

appropriate to the procedure by way of case stated: it is a matter for

prerogative order.

The question of time bar which was considered by the Board of Review is not a

question that requires the leading of evidence and the above case does not apply.

Therefore and even otherwise, as paragraph 31 of the said written submissions

say, there is no need of tendering an affidavit.

7. Alleged Time Bar

The Final Consolidated written submissions of the respondent is dated 15th June

2022.

Without prejudice to the preliminary objection, the respondent submits that the

assessments are time barred.

The following table shows the dates on which the particular assessments become

time barred, as per the respondent.

Paragraph 96 of the said written submission quotes from John Keels Case No. 1

and says,

On a careful survey of the findings I am of the view, that the Presidential

Grant of the land 8 Acres 2 Roods 21.44 Perches which is within the

declared limits of the Port of Colombo; the grant of investment relief by the

Board of Investments to Lanka Marine Services Ltd., resulting inter alia in

relief from the payment of taxes that are due and, the entering into of the

Common Users Facility Agreement with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority are

severable from the sale of shares. Accordingly, I allow the relief prayed for

in prayer (g), (h) and (i) of the prayer to the petition and declare the

Presidential Grant marked P31 as null and void. The 18th, 19th, 20th and

21 st respondents will vacate the land within one month from today and

restore possession to Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The Common User Facility

Agreement dated 20.08.2002 (P19(a)) is declared null and void and the Sri

Lanka Ports Authority may enter into fresh Agreements for the use of

facilities within the Port on equal terms with all parties licensed to supply

bunkers.

All agreements entered into between the Board of Investment and Lanka

Marine Services Ltd., are declared null and void and the Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue is directed to recover all taxes due on the

basis that such Agreements have not been in force. [Emphasis added

in the said written submissions]

It is said at paragraph 97 that the Chief Justice cannot be understood to have

meant that taxes should be recovered contrary to law.

The said judgment at page 156 in bold print stated,

The date of the BOI letter granting tax exemption being 11.07.2002

may have some significance since on the very next day - 12.07.2002,

Jayasundera rushed a letter to Ratnayake that the JKH bid was

accepted and that it is proposed to conclude the transaction .

Ratnayake replied on the same day 12.07.2002 stating that they are

willing to conclude the transaction. There is indeed, amazing speed,

in concluding a transaction as to the sale of a public asset which also

included 8 Acres of land in the Port of Colombo. All this was done

when the proposed process of sale had not been even considered by

the Cabinet. The Cabinet considered the process, a month later on

14.08.2002.

It said at page 159,

Whereas, if in effect the monopoly was going to continue for a limited

period of time the bidders may have had a basis to enhance their bids.

Hence Jayasunderas action was adverse to the interests of the State in

securing a better price. He failed to take into account the specific decision of

the Cabinet that the monopoly would at the least would continue to the Port

of Colombo for one year.

It said at page 161,

JKH knew fully well that this was not a mere sale, but a sale of shares

owned by a Public Corporation in an extremely lucrative venture. That,

transparency and action being taken according to law should necessarily

31 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

underpin the validity of the transaction. The declared basis at the Pre Bid

Conference attended by Ratnayake representing JKH was that there will be

no monopoly after the sale and that other suppliers of bunkers would be

issued licenses. This premise would necessarily have inhibited bidders from

quoting a higher price. In any event the object of the Cabinet was not to

secure a higher price by preserving the monopoly. It was, as noted above is

to enhance competition, to lower bunker prices, improve facilities and

thereby increase the revenue yield to the State. Having come in on this

openly declared premise, no sooner the bid was accepted by Jayasundera,

Ratnayake moved quickly to get the former committed to an inclusion of

clause 8.2. The obvious purpose of getting clause 8.2 included was to drive

away competitors as manifested by the subsequent conduct of JKH of

procuring the SLPA to take action against the 32nd respondent and

thereafter by directly instituting legal proceedings against the latter. Hence

I cannot agree with the submission of bona fides.

The judgment said at page 170,

JKH/LMSL pursued their rights under the Agreement P27 and the

Government was compelled to seek extensions of the period of 1 year

granted to "ensure the transfer of the land. There were accordingly 4

amendments to the Agreement. Finally the then President made a Grant

under the Public Seal of the Republic in respect of the land to LMSL under

the State Lands Ordinance. The Grant P30 states that it is made in

consideration of Rs. 1,199,362,500/= paid to the Republic by LMSL. It is

common ground that this statement is incorrect. In fact no money was paid

by LMSL to the Government. The amount is the sum as that paid on

06.09.2002 by JKH to CPC for the purchase of shares of LMSL. Hence the

grant is bad in law solely on the ground of the misstatement as to

consideration. Any Grant made by the Head of State under the Public Seal

of the Republic should have the sanctity of truth in its contents. In normal

circumstances a false statement as to a payment to the Government could

not be made since, it has to be verified by the Treasury. But regrettably, that

check is not there since by now the same Jayasundera who was responsible

for the creation of the fiction in favour of the JKH that there would be no

additional payment in respect of the land, is now ensconced as the

Secretary to the Treasury.

It said at page 176,

When looking at the two letters bearing the same date one gets the

impression that Jayasundera and Ratnayake sat across the table and

exchanged them. Counsel for JKH submitted that they were exchanged by

FAX. Jayasunderas FAX letter bears time 4.45 p.m. and Ratnayakes Fax

the time 5.30. The documents have not been produced by JKH and I have

noted the times based only on submissions. Whatever be the travails of

other bidders, the timing fitted well to Ratnayake's affairs since according

to document P37 (subsequently obtained by the petitioner from the BOI) by

letter dated 11.07.2002 the BOI informed JKH that the application for tax

relief in this regard has been allowed I have already under the heading "E"

dealt with the false and illegal manner in which JKH secured the tax relief.

Then it said at page 180,

On the basis of the aforesaid findings I hold that the entire process of the

sale of shares of Lanka Marine Services Ltd., to John Keells Holdings has

been done without lawful authority. P.B. Jayasundera being the 8th

respondent and the then Chairman of the Public Enterprise Reform

Commission, from the very commencement of the process, has acted outside

the authority, of the applicable law being the Public Enterprise Reform

Commission Act No. 1 of 1996 and the functions mandated to be done by

the Commission as contained in the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers. He

had not only acted contrary to the law but purported to arrogate to himself

33 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

the authority of the Executive Government. His action is not only illegal and

in excess of lawful authority but also biased in favour of JKH.

From the perspective of JKH I hold that the company has secured

advantages and benefits through the illegal process and in specific

instances by misrepresentations that have been made.

It was thereafter, at page 182, that His Lordship the Chief Justice came to the

conclusion, quoted at paragraph 96 of the above written submissions of the

respondent, saying,

The defence of time bar pleaded by the respondent must necessarily fail

since the impugned transfer was not conducted according to obtain material

documents from sources that were not accessible to him. This is borne out

by the fact that material documents P31 and P37 on which significant

findings have been made were obtained from the Board of Investments after

the applications was filed. Accordingly, I overrule the objections based on

locus standi and time bar and grant to the petitioner the relief sought in

prayer (b) of the petition that there has been an infringement of the

fundamental right guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution by

executive or administrative action.

Ordinarily, the grant of a declaration that executive or administrative action

is an infringement of the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 12(1)

would result in a restoration of the status quo ante. However, since the

jurisdiction vested in this Court in terms of Article 126(4) of the Constitution

is to grant relief or to make directions as it may seem just and equitable, it

is open to the Court to ascertain whether the implications of the impugned

executive action are severable. On a careful survey of the findings I am of

the view, that the Presidential Grant of the land 8 Acres 2 Roods 21.44

Perches which is within the declared limits of the Port of Colombo; the grant

of investment relief by the Board of Investments to Lanka Marine Services

Ltd., resulting inter alia in relief from the payment of taxes that are due and,

34 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

the entering into of the Common Users Facility Agreement with the Sri Lanka

Ports Authority are severable from the sale of shares. Accordingly, I allow

the relief prayed for in prayer (g), (h) and (i) of the prayer to the petition and

declare the Presidential Grant marked P31 as null and void. The 18th, 19th,

20th and 21 st respondents will vacate the land within one month from

today and restore possession to Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The Common

User Facility Agreement dated 20.08.2002 (P19(a)) is declared null and void

and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority may enter into fresh Agreements for the

use of facilities within the Port on equal terms with all parties licensed to

supply bunkers.

All agreements entered into between the Board of Investment and Lanka

Marine Services Ltd., are declared null and void and the Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue is directed to recover all taxes due on the basis

that such Agreements have not been in force.

The above reasoning, with its strong emphasis on fraud, does not show an

inclination to stop at an objection of time bar.

Hence it is the decision of this court that the particular findings and decisions

of the Supreme Court in the above case makes that time bar provision has no

avail.

8. Statutory provisions re. assessments pertaining to fraud

Furthermore, what is the law pertaining to imposing such tax, when there

is fraud?

The respondent in paragraph 39 of written submissions dated 13th August 2018

has quoted section 134(5) of Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000. Section 134 is

the first section in Chapter XVIII on Assessments. As quoted by the respondent,

the said section says,

35 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

(5) Subject to the provisions of section 67. no assessment shall

be made, of the income tax payable under this Act. for any year

of assessment by any person who has made a return of his

income,

(a) on or before the thirtieth day of November of the

year of assessment immediately succeeding that year

of assessment, after the expiry of three years from the

end of that year of assessment:

(b) after the thirtieth days of November but on or

before the thirty first day of March, after the expiry of

six years from the end of that year of assessment:

Provided, that nothing in this subsection shall apply to the

assessment of income tax payable by any person in respect of any

year of assessment, consequent to the receipt by such person, of

any arrears relating to the profits from employment of that person

for that year of assessment :

Provided further that, where in the opinion of the

Assessor, any fraud, evasion or willful default has been

committed by or on behalf of, any person, in relation to any

income tax, payable by such person for any year of assessment, it

shall be lawful for the Assessor to make an assessment or an

additional assessment on such person not later than five years

after the end of that year of assessment. [Emphasis added in

this judgment]

This second proviso appeared in the original Act No. 38 of 2000 as follows,

Provided further that. where in the opinion of the Assessor. any fraud,

evasion or willful default has been committed by, or on behalf of, any

person, in relation to any income tax, payable by such person for any year

36 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

of assessment, it shall be lawful for the Assessor to make an assessment

or an additional assessment on such person at any time after the end of

that year of assessment.

The provision in the original second proviso was amended by Inland Revenue

(Amendment) Act No. 37 of 2003, which came into operation on 14th November

2003. The amendment said,

50. Section 134 of the principal enactment is hereby amended in

subsection (5) of that section as follows,.

(2)in the second proviso to that subsection, by the substitution for the

words at any time after the end of that year of assessment, of the

words not later than five years after the end of that year of

assessment.

The said second proviso was again amened by Act No. 08 of 2005, which came

into operation on 31st March 2005. It said,

38. Section 134 of the principle enactment as last amended by Act No.

12 of 2004 [that did not concern the second proviso] is hereby further

amended in subsection (5) of that section as follows,.

(2)in the second proviso to that subsection by the substitution for the

words not later than five years from the end of that year of assessment,

of the words at any time after the end of that year of assessment.

Hence this last said provision was the one in force when notices of assessment

in this case were sent on 07th January 2009.

Hence the section says, Provided further that, where in the opinion of the

Assessor any fraud, evasion or willful default has been committed by, or on

behalf of, any person, in relation to any income tax, payable by such person for

any year of assessment, it shall be lawful for the assessor to make an assessment

37 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

or an additional assessment on such person at any time after the end of that

year of assessment.

As per the above judgment of the Supreme Court, the Assessor is bound to make

such an opinion. Therefore tax can be validly assessed at any time after the end

of that year of assessment.

9. Reasoning on section 11(A) (6) of TAC Act

The argument in respect of the analysis of jurisdiction of this court under

section 11(A) (6) of Tax Appeals Commission Act was already decided by

this court in Cargills Agrifoods Limited vs. The Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue, C. A. Tax 41/2014 decided on 28th February 20231.

In that case, the respondent Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, took up

a jurisdictional objection based on Koggala Garment Limited case, in 2018. But

later in December 2022, the respondent relinquished that argument in favour of

jurisdiction of this court. But in that case, this court, considered the said

objection to jurisdiction in respect of section 11(A) (6), on the basis that parties

cannot by agreement cloth the court with jurisdiction. This court said in that

case,

This was the position of the Respondent in September 2018. By December

2022, the Respondent has abandoned this argument in favour of the

jurisdiction of this Court in a Case Stated in a matter which there is no

determination by the Tax Appeals Commission on the substantial question.

Perhaps, from 2018 to 2022 a number of Respondents apart from the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, taking up the above objection

based on the Koggala Garments case, must have changed the mind of the

present Respondent.

1 Justice Sasi Mahendran and myself.

38 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

But, it is a basic rule of law that if a tribunal or a Court has no jurisdiction,

the parties cannot by consent cloth it with jurisdiction.

What shall the Court of Appeal do when it receives such a case stated?

Section 11A.(6) says,

11A. (6) Any two or more Judges of the Court of Appeal may hear and

determine any question of law arising on the stated case and may in

accordance with the decision of the Court upon such question, confirm,

reduce, increase or annul the assessment determined by the Commission,

or may remit the case to the Commission with the opinion of the Court,

thereon. Where a case is so remitted by the Court, the Commission shall

revise the assessment in accordance with the opinion of the Court.

Hence, any two or more Judges of the Court of Appeal may,

(i) determine any question of law arising on the stated case, It does

not say may determine the determination of the Commission.

(ii) (ii) confirm, reduce, increase or annul the assessment determined

by the Commission,

(iii) (iii) or may remit the case to the Commission with the opinion of

the Court, thereon.

This may or may not be on the determination of the Commission,

because the term thereon refers to any question of law arising on the

stated case.

What does the next sentence mean?

Where a case is so remitted by the Court, the Commission shall revise

the assessment in accordance with the opinion of the Court.

39 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

If the question of law arose was not with regard to the assessment

determined by the Commission, how shall the Commission revise the

assessment?

The answer is, that, the assessment, referred to in the last sentence is,

the assessment made by the assessor.

This is why, the previous sentence refers to the assessment determined by

the Commission but the last sentence just say assessment.

The legislature will not waste words as well as it will not use words without

a meaning.

Hence it is clear that,

(a) there can be a case stated on a question of law other than the

determination of the Commission on tax,

(b) the Court has power to remit the case to the Commission, with its

opinion on the question of law so arose and

(c) the Commission shall, on receiving such an opinion of the Court,

revise the assessment of the assessor.

Hence, this Court has jurisdiction to go into the questions in the present case

stated.

That is the answer of this court to the question raised on the language of section

11(A) (6).

Hence, the preliminary jurisdictional objection is overruled and this Court

decides that it has jurisdiction to decide the Questions of Law in the Case

Stated.

10. Conclusion

As already said, the Tax Appeals Commission has misdirected itself in respect of

the operation of the subsequent order in case John Keels Case No. 2 dated 13th

40 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

October 2009, in that, it decided that the said order completely reversed the

position of the judgment in John Keels Case No. 1 dated 27th July 2008. The way

it misread the subsequent order is clear that it even said that the Supreme Court

in the subsequent case was presided by Chief Justice Dr. Shirani

Bandaranayake, whereas by that date she has not yet become the Chief Justice.

The subsequent order only dealt with restrictions imposed upon Jayasundera

not by the judgment dated 27th July 2008 but by a subsequent order dated 10th

August 2008. The subsequent order did not change anything in the earlier

judgment. Hence the tax liability created by the judgment remains and the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue is bound to issue notice on such

assessment and take subsequent steps.

Therefore the two questions of law are answered as follows,

1. Has the Tax Appeals Commission erred in interpreting the Supreme Court

judgment dated 21.07.2008, in a Fundamental Rights Application filed in

the same court bearing No. S.C. (F.R.) 209/2007?

Yes.

2. Has the Tax Appeals Commission misread some other judgment in

interpreting Supreme Court judgment No. S. C. (F. R.) 209/2007 dated

21.07.2008?

The Tax Appeals Commission was under the wrong impression that the said

judgment dated 21st July 2008 was completely reversed, whereas, it was not

reversed, completely or otherwise.

41 | C . A . T a x 3 0 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 1 s t M a r c h 2 0 2 3

Hence this case is remitted to the Tax Appeals Commission, with the above

opinion of this court, for the Tax Appeals Commission to take further steps

according to the said opinion. There is no order on costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

Hon. Sasi Mahendran J.,

I agree.
