ORDER

P.Kumararatnam,J.

The Petitioner filing this Application has invoked the jurisdiction of this

Court to grant bail to her father who is the Suspect in this case upon

suitable condition as this Court considers appropriate.

CA BAIL 255-2023

3 | P a g e

The Suspect was arrested on 13.03.2020 by the Police officers attached

to Teldeniya Police Station. He was produced before the Magistrate of

Teldeniya.

The Suspect was arrested upon an information that the Suspect was

engaging in trafficking Heroin in Teldeniya Police area. As per the

information Suspect was arrested in Digana Town with the contraband.

The parcel contained some substances which reacted for Heroin

(Diacetylmorphine). The substance weighed about 81.410 grams. The

Suspect was handed over along with the production to the Teldeniya

Police Station for further investigation and necessary action.

The Suspect was produced and facts were reported to the Teldeniya

Magistrate under Sections 54A (d) and (b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984.

The production had been sent to the Government Analyst Department

and after analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded the report to

the Teldeniya Magistrate Court. According to the Government Analyst,

15.329 grams of pure Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) had been detected

from the substance sent for the analysis.

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in

support of her Bail Application.

1. The Accused has been in remand custody more than three years.

2. The Accused is the sole breadwinner of the family and father of

04 children.

3. Wrong previous conviction certificate had been filed in the High

Court.

The Learned State Counsel submitted that the delay is not an

exceptional circumstance to be considered to enlarge the suspect on

bail. Further, the time spent for preparing the indictment does not

constitute an exceptional circumstance. According to the State,

indictment has already been forwarded to the High Court of Kandy.

CA BAIL 255-2023

The suspect is in remand more than three years. According to

Government Analyst Report the pure quantity of Heroin detected is

15.329 grams.

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what

is exceptional circumstances must be considered on its own facts and

circumstances on a case-by-case basis.

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

In CA(PHC)APN 107/2018 decided on 19.03.2019 the court held that

remanding for a period of one year and five months without being

served with the in indictment was considered inter alia in releasing the

suspect on bail. According to the Petitioner, at present her family is

going through untold hardship without proper income and care.

The Section 83 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act

which was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states:

83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under

sections 54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail

by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 84 and 85, a person

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A

and section 54B-

(a) of which the pure quantity of the dangerous drug, trafficked,

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms

CA BAIL 255-2023

5 | P a g e

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A;

and

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment, shall not

be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in exceptional

circumstances.

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in

exceptional circumstances.

In this case the pure quantity of Heroin detected in the production by

the Government Analyst is 15.329 grams. Hence, this court has

jurisdiction to consider granting of bail as per the new amendment.

The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner urged this Court to consider that

detaining a suspect without any legal action for an extended period of

time amounts to a violation of his fundamental rights which can be

considered as an exceptional ground.

Although more than three years passed after the arrest of the Accused,

the trial has not commenced in the High Court of Kandy. Further, no

indication of commencing the trial in near future.

In Nasher v. Director of Public Prosecution [2020] VSCA 144 the

court held that:

a combination of delay, onerous custodial conditions, and the

relative weakness of the prosecution case may, when considered

with all relevant circumstances, compel the conclusion that

exceptional circumstances have been established. [Emphasis added]

The right to trial without undue delay is found in numerous

international and regional human rights instruments; for example, the

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 14(3)(c), the

CA BAIL 255-2023

6 | P a g e

American Convention on Human Rights (Article 8(1), the African

Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (Article 7(1)(d), and the

European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and

Fundamental Freedoms (Article 6(1).

When a person is kept in remand without taking his or her case for trial

for a considerable period of time, he or she should be released on bail

pending trial. Otherwise, this will lead not only to prison overcrowding

but also violates his or her fundamental rights which have been

guaranteed under the Constitution.

Hence, I consider the delay more than three years in remand falls into

the category of excessive and oppressive delay considering the

circumstances of this case. Hence, considering all the circumstances of

this case, the Accused has very good exceptional circumstances to

consider this application in his favour. Further, remanding a suspect

without commencing his or her trial will prejudice his or her rights and

family as well.

Offences under Section 54A(d) and 54A(b) of the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is no

doubt serious offences but seriousness of the offence alone cannot form

a ground to refuse bail. In considering these matters, the court must

bear in mind the presumption of innocence.

Further, bail should never be withheld as punishment. Granting of bail

is primarily at the discretion of the Courts. The discretion should be

exercised with due care and caution taking into account the facts and

circumstances of each case.

Considering all these factors into account, especially the period in

remand, the pure quantity of Heroin detected and the circumstances of

the case, I consider this an appropriate case to grant bail to the

Accused. Hence, I order the Accused be granted bail with following

strict conditions.

CA BAIL 255-2023

7 | P a g e

1. Cash bail of Rs.100,000/=.

2. To provide 02 sureties. They must sign a bond of two million

each.

3. The Accused and the sureties must reside in the address given

until conclusion of his case.

4. Not to approach any prosecution witnesses directly or indirectly

or to interfere with.

5. To surrender his passport if any, to court and not to apply for a

travel document. The Controller of the Immigration and

Emigration is informed of the travel ban on the Accused.

6. To report to the Teldeniya Police Station on the last Sunday of

every month between 9am to 1pm.

7. Any breach of these conditions is likely to result in the

cancellation of his bail.

The Bail Application is allowed and the Learned High Court Judge of

Kandy is hereby directed to enlarge the Accused on bail on the above

bail conditions.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this order to the High

Court of Kandy and the Head Quarters Inspector, Police Station,

Teldeniya.
