Introduction

1) The Petitioners have instituted this action to invoke the Writ Jurisdiction

of this Court to obtain reliefs prayed for in the prayers a, b, c, f and g.

2) The said prayers are referred to in the petition dated 27th September

2022 as follows.

a) Issue notice of this application on the Respondents;

b) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the

decision to hold an interview to decide the eligibility of the Petitioners

to commence the Training Programme of two years duration

conducted by the training branch of CEB as a qualification for the

promotion to the post of Superintendent (Electrical);

c) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of mandamus directing the

2nd to 9th Respondents to permit the Petitioners to follow the Training

Programme of two years duration conducted by the training branch of

CEB as a qualification for the promotion to the post of Superintendent

(Electrical);

f) Grant costs; and

g) Grant such other and further relief as to Your Lordships Court

shall seem fit and meet.

The factual position of this case

3) The Petitioners have contended that they belonged to Billman or Middle

Level Technical Service or Clerical or Allied Services.

4) The Petitioners have stated that the 2nd Respondent had issued a circular

No. 2002/GM/32(3)/Policy for internal recruitment for the post of

Superintendent (Electrical). This circular had been issued in terms of

the revised scheme of recruitment and promotions of Middle Level

C.A. WRIT No. 350 - 22

14

Technical Services. The said circular refers to the internal recruitment as

follows;

1.1. (a) 45% of the cadre of EES should be filled from the CEB

employees who have successfully completed the First

Examination for the Electrical Superintendents Service.

Present qualifications continue to apply.

5) Subsequently, the qualification criteria for recruitment had been revised

by the Board Decisions taken by the 2nd Respondent.

6) Accordingly, the Board approval had been granted to include the

following criteria for employee categories of Billman or Middle Level

Technical Service or Clerical or Allied Services who have passed 3

subjects out of Pure Mathematics, Combined Mathematics, Chemistry or

Physics at the GCE Advanced Level Examination.

7) Subsequently, the Petitioners have received letters from the HR Manager

stating that the Petitioners are eligible to face the interview to be

considered for the recruitment for the post of Electrical Superintendent -

Grade II.

8) It is the general practice of the 2nd Respondent to include the relevant

marking scheme in the letter issued to an employee, to attend an

interview in order to maintain the transparency of the process, but the

letters received by the Petitioners did not contain such information.

9) Further, the Petitioners have stated that, the impression given was that

the purpose of the interview was to ascertain whether the Petitioners had

satisfied the educational requirements as the Petitioners were directed to

produce the originals and photocopies of the respective educational

certificates.

10) The Petitioners were well aware that the qualification criteria for the

promotion to the post of Superintendent (Electronic) do not entail an

interview in order to be eligible to commence the said training

programme.

C.A. WRIT No. 350 - 22

15

11) As the Petitioners were noticed of a marking scheme, they questioned

about the said purported marking scheme, and the interview panel

assured that they had received strict instructions to follow it.

12) The Petitioners were made aware, that the Marking Scheme for Interview

of Recruitment to Superintendents Service from Field Technical Service

(Examination Stream) was used and the Petitioners state that it is not

applicable to the promotion of the Petitioners.

13) It is further stated that Petitioners have not been informed of the

outcome of the said interview despite attempts by the Petitioners to

ascertain the final results. Thus, the Petitioners have also requested

under Right to Information.

14) The Petitioners have become aware that the name lists had been

published from the interview under the title The Electrical

Superintendents required to report to Deputy General Manager (Training)

for training on 15.09.2022.

15) The 2nd to 9th Respondents have failed to state any basis and/or reasons

to justify the decision to afford special treatment and/or preference

and/or priority to the 10th to 60th Respondents. Thus, it is stated that the

2nd to 9th Respondents would continue to afford undue advantage,

preference, special treatment and priority.

16) The Petitioners argued that the purported decisions to hold interviews for

the Petitioners are ex facie arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious and

clearly against the fundamental principles of natural justice, ultra-vires

and of no effect in law, or have taken irrelevant matters into

consideration and misdirected themselves in law and fact.

17) The Respondents have filed the statement of objections and contended

that a candidate must pass the First Board Examination, thereafter will

face an interview and the qualifying candidates will be sent for a two year

training programme.

C.A. WRIT No. 350 - 22

16

18) Upon the conclusion of the two year training programme, an evaluation

will be conducted, namely a trade test and a viva.

19) Those candidates who pass the trade test and the viva will eventually be

recruited to the post of Superintendent (Electrical).

20) The Respondents have denied the position taken by the Petitioners that

they did not have any access to the SORP and/or the marking scheme

applicable to be recruited to the post of Superintendent (Electrical), as

the Petitioners have access to the internet site known as CEB info which

contains all circulars, manuals and guideline.

21) Furthermore, successful candidates who procured the requisite pass

mark at the said interview were duly informed and notified of the training

programme.

22) CEB is preparing a response to the Right to Information requests

forwarded by the Petitioners.

23) As per the decision of the Board dated 11th December 2013 to be

appointed to the post of Superintendent (Electrical), a candidate must

pass the First Board Examination, face an interview and then the

qualifying candidates will be sent for a two year training programme.

24) The Petitioners grievance is that they do not belong to a category of

employees who do possess Experience in the field Technical Service and

therefore will not receive marks under that category at the interview.

25) For such reasons the Petitioners claim that the said marking scheme

cannot be applied to the Petitioners.

26) The Board has decided to allow employees in the Non-Technical Service

category to enter into field service through this recruitment process.

27) An examination is held to select those employees who demonstrate

technical knowledge and expertise at an interview, consequent to which

such employees in the Non-Technical Services may enter into the field

service.

C.A. WRIT No. 350 - 22

17

28) Although Petitioners were not qualified, employees of the same category

of the Petitioners have obtained the requisite pass mark and have been

admitted to the two year training programme.

29) No preferential treatment meted out to any of the candidates.

30) The Respondents have further stated that they have at all times to this

application, acted in good faith and in compliance with all applicable

laws, rules and regulations.

Disputed facts

31) Considering the facts pertinent to the application made by the Petitioners

and on perusal of the documents, written submissions and the

arguments raised before this Court, I am of the view that to grant the

reliefs claimed by the Petitioners in the petition dated 27th September

2022, the following questions should be addressed.

I. Do the Petitioners belong to Billman or Middle Level Technical Service or

Clerical or Allied Services?

II. Are the Petitioners entitled for the revised scheme of recruitment and

promotions of Middle Level Technical Services (Superintendent Service)?

III. Has the 2nd Respondent decided on 11th December 2013, that to be

appointed to the post of Superintendent (Electrical), a candidate must

pass the First Board Examination, face an interview and then the

qualifying candidate will be sent for 2 years training programme?

IV. If so, are the Petitioners entitled for Writ of Certiorari and Writ of

Mandamus prayed for in the prayer of the petition date 27th September

2022 against the Respondents?

C.A. WRIT No. 350 - 22

18

I. Do the Petitioners belong to Billman or Middle Level Technical

Service or Clerical or Allied Services?

32) The Respondents have not challenged that the Petitioners do not belong

to the categories of Billman or Middle Level Technical Service or Clerical

or Allied Services.

33) On perusal of P1 to P7 documents, it is proven that the Petitioners have

been recruited for the aforesaid categories.

34) Thus, there is no dispute in respect of the categories referred to by the

Petitioners as to their employment.

II. Are the Petitioners eligible for the revised scheme of recruitment

and promotions of Middle Level Technical Services (Superintendent

Service)?

35) All the Petitioners have been recruited as Billman or Middle Level

Technical Service or Clerical or Allied Services. That fact is proven by P1

to P7 documents. The said documents are not challenged by the

Respondents.

36) Subsequently, the said Petitioners have duly passed the First Board

Examination. That fact is confirmed by P46 to P79 documents. The said

documents have not been challenged by the Respondents.

37) P36(a) document under which the Petitioners have applied for the revised

scheme of recruitment and promotions of Middle Level Technical Service

(Superintendent Service) is referred to on page 29 of P35 document.

38) It is obvious when observing P36(a) and P36(b) that the Board decisions

of the 2nd Respondent had decided that the Billman who passed the First

Board Examination will be eligible for promotion to the post of

Superintendent.

39) The relevant portion of the said P36(a) document is reproduced as

follows;

C.A. WRIT No. 350 - 22

19

Note: Employees in category i, ii and iii other than Billman, who

pass the First Board Examination will be eligible for promotion to

the Post of Superintendent (Electrical, Mechanical or Civil) on

successful completion of;

a) Two years service in the skilled field service

b) Training program of three months duration conducted by the

training branch, and

c) Passing of Trade test and viva

40) Further, the relevant portion of the P36(b) document is reproduced as

follows;

The Board approval was granted to include following qualification

criteria for employee categories of Billman, Middle Level Technical

Service and for Clerical and Allied Services who had passed three

subjects out of Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Combined

Mathematics, Chemistry or Physics at GCE Advanced Level

Examinations, as recommended in the Board Paper to the decision

under minute number 13.17.98.

Billman who pass the first board examination will be eligible for

promotion to the post of Superintendent (Electrical) on successful

completion of

i) Two years service in the skilled field service

ii) Training program of two years duration conducted by the

training branch, and

iii) Passing of trade test and viva

Employee in the categories of middle level technical service and

clerical and allied service who passed the 1st Board Examination

will be eligible for promotion to Post of Superintendent (Electrical,

Mechanical or Civil) on successful completion of

C.A. WRIT No. 350 - 22

20

i) Training Program of 2 years duration conducted by the

training branch, and

ii) Passing of trade test and viva.

41) In considering the said two documents it is obvious that the Petitioners

category employees are eligible, after passing the First Board

Examination to be promoted to the post of Superintendent.

42) Now, I draw my attention to the document marked and produced as P8.

The said P8 document is issued by the Human Resource Manager who is

the 6th Respondent.

C.A. WRIT No. 350 - 22

21

43) In the said document it states that the employment category that the

Petitioners belong to, are eligible to be considered to face the interview for

the recruitment to the post of Electrical Superintendent - Grade II.

44) In view of P8, P36(a), P36(b) and considering the recruitment letters of

the Petitioners P1 to P7 and P46 to P79 documents on which the

Petitioners have passed the First Board Examination had given them the

eligibility to face the interview to be considered for the post of Electrical

Superintendent - Grade II.

III. Has the 2nd Respondent decided on 11th December 2013 that to be

appointed to the post of Superintendent (Electrical), a candidate

must pass the First Board Examination, face an interview and then

the qualifying candidate will be sent for 2 years training

programme?

45) On perusal of P36(b) the 2nd Respondents Board Decision, it has

specifically stated that Billman who passes the First Board Examination

will be eligible for promotion to the post of Superintendent on the

successful completion of

i) 2 years service in the skilled field service,

ii) training program of 2 years duration conducted by the training

branch,

iii) passing of trade test and viva.

46) Further, in P36(a) the Board Meeting of the 2nd Respondent had

reiterated the same P36(b) criteria.

47) Beside these facts, P8 document confirms that the 6th Respondent, the

Human Resources Manager of the 2nd Respondent had issued the letter

dated 30th June 2022 stating that the Petitioners are eligible to face the

interview to consider for the recruitment to the post of Electrical

Superintendent - Grade II.

C.A. WRIT No. 350 - 22

22

48) In the said circumstances, it is obvious by P36(a), P36(b) and P8

documents that the employees of the category of the Petitioners Grade

are eligible to face an interview and then the qualifying candidates will be

sent for 2 years training programme.

IV. If so, are the Petitioners entitled for Writ of Certiorari and Writ of

Mandamus prayed for in the prayer of the petition dated 27th

September 2022 against the Respondents?

49) In the instant application the Petitioners have raised their arguments

based on the documents marked as P35, P36(a), P36(b) and P8. The

Presidents Counsel Shamil Perera brought to the notice of the Court that

the category on which the Petitioners are eligible is different to the Field

Technical Service category employees, who are eligible to face the same

interview.

50) The position taken by the Respondents is that the eligible candidates had

been interviewed and recruited as per the marking scheme marked and

produced as R1.

51) Further, the Counsel for the Respondents had reiterated that the

technical knowledge possessed by the eligible candidates had been

considered as per P35 document.

52) However, the Counsel for the Petitioners challenged the said argument

and brought to the notice of the Court that P35 document promotion

scheme under 5.1 states that only Field Technical Service employees are

eligible to face the said interview and should possess technical

experience.

53) None of the Board Circulars contain that the Billman category should

possess technical knowledge. It is obvious that the Billman category

employees will not have the opportunity of gaining technical experience

during their career.

C.A. WRIT No. 350 - 22

23

54) Thus, after taking the Board Decisions reflected in P36(a) and (b) to

recruit the Billman category to the post of Electrical Superintendent and

rejecting their applications on the ground that they have no technical

experience is arbitrary and unreasonable to my considered view.

55) In considering the facts pertinent from P5 to P107 documents and R1

and R2 documents, the marking scheme which had been given to the

field officers or which is in the website of CEB Info is immaterial

pertinent to the recruitment eligibility for the post of Electrical

Superintendent - Grade II.

56) Thus, to my view as per P35, P36(a), P36(b) and P8 documents the

Petitioners have a legitimate expectation that they will be recruited for

the post of Electrical Superintendent - Grade II.

57) In view of that, the Petitioners have the right to obtain a Writ of Certiorari

to review that the appointment is unreasonable.

58) In Writ of Certiorari court has to consider;

1. Want or excess of jurisdiction

2. Denial of Natural Justice

3. Unreasonableness

59) The said 3 principles are relevant to this application. Lord Denning in the

case of Metropolitan Properties Co. V Lannon and Others1 had

emphasized that what is important is that there is no appearance of bias,

stating:

The Court will not inquire whether he did, in fact, favour one

side unfairly. Suffice it that reasonable people might think he

did. The reason is plain enough. Justice must be rooted in

confidences and confidence is destroyed when right-minded

people go away thinking: "The Judge was biased".

1 [1968] EWCA Civ 5, [1969] 1 QB 577.

C.A. WRIT No. 350 - 22

24

60) Further, Justice Palakidnar in the case of Podimahtthaya V the Land

Reform Commission2 had said that;

On the more basic circumstance of the interference of this

Court by a writ, one must examine whether there was

reasonableness This Court can interfere where there is

manifest unreasonableness in an administrative act. The test

is whether the administrative authority has acted within the

rules of reason and justice. The conduct of the administrative

authority must be legal and regular as one correlates the acts

complained about to the powers given under the statute.

61) Further, it is reported in the case of Premachandra V Montague

Jayawickrama and Others3. His Lordship the Chief Justice in the said

judgement had referred to as follow;

It is a cardinal maxim that every power has legal limits,

however wide the language of the empowering Act. If the

Court finds that the power has been exercised oppressively or

unreasonably, or if there has been some procedural failing,

such as not allowing a person affected to put forward his

case, the act may be condemned as unlawful. There are no

absolute or unfettered discretions in public law; discretions

are conferred on public functionaries in trust for the public, to

be used for the public good, and the propriety of the exercise

of such discretions is to be judged by reference to the

purposes for which they were so entrusted.

62) In the case of Kotakadeniya V Kodituwakku and Others4 as per the

facts of the case, the De Silva J. held that;

2 [1990] 2 SLR 416 at page 419. 3 1994 2 SLR 90. 4 [2000] 2 SLR 175.

C.A. WRIT No. 350 - 22

There are several decisions of the Supreme Court where it

has been held that the ouster clause would be of no effect if

the order is made by an officer who does not have legal

authority to do so. In such case the decision is null and void

and the preclusive clause in the Constitution is no bar to

review.

63) As per the said judgements it is obvious when the conduct of an

institution is unreasonable against the employees, the Court has the

power to review it.

64) The 2nd relief claimed by the Petitioners is to issue a Writ of Mandamus.

A Writ of Mandamus is sought by a party to compel the performance of a

public duty.

65) In the decision of Karawita and Others and Welikanna V Inspector

General of Police and Others5 Gamini Amaratunga, J.

held that;

Within the field of Public Law, the scope of Madamus is still

wide and the Court may use it freely to prevent breach of duty

and injustice The absence of precedent does not deter me

when I am convinced that the only effective remedy to remedy

the injustice caused to the petitioners is an order of

Mandamus.

66) In considering the aforesaid decisions, my candid view is that the 2nd

Respondent had acted arbitrarily and unreasonably without considering

the Borad decision which is reflected in P36(a), P36(b) and letter of

interview P8 documents.

67) Therefore, the Petitioners in the instant application have proven the facts

that their rights were arbitrarily deprived by the 2nd Respondent in the

interview for them to gain marks under technical experience category.

and (f) subject to tax cost as prayed for in the prayer of the petition dated

27th September 2022.
