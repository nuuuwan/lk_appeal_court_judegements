Argued on: 15.12.2022

Decided on: 01.02.2023

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to obtain bail to the Suspect-Petitioner

namely, Withanachchi Koralage Sandamal Nilantha under the Provisions of

the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act.

The suspect had been initially arrested and produced for raping a girl of 12

years by the name of Piyumi Samanali on 31.01.2021.

On being released on bail the suspect is supposed to have gone to their house

and had threatened the victim and the parents. Thereafter, the police had

produced the suspect under the instant Act under BR 123/2021. The

Magistrate had remanded the suspect. The suspect had been in remand

since then.

The Counsel for the suspect did not submit any exceptional ground.

But the Counsel appearing for the Respondent stated that the indictment

with regard to the instant matter is ready and is about to be dispatched to

the relevant High Court.

The bail pertaining to the instant matter is that a suspect or an accused

produced under the instant Act, has to submit exceptional ground to be

enlarged on bail by the Court of Appeal. The term exceptional has not been

defined in the Act. But the literal meaning of the term is that, it is something

which is out of the ordinary. The cases so far decided it has been held that

what is out of the ordinary depends on the facts of each case. Therefore, in

Page 4 of 4

the instant matter we see no such submissions being made by the Counsel

for the suspect. As such, the instant application for bail is dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

I agree.
