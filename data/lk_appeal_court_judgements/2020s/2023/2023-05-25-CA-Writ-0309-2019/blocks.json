As I have already stated above in this order, by the said letter, the Secretary to the Ministry has informed the NFC that the agreements entered between the NFC and the private circuits are null and void and to inform the parties not to engage in the distribution of films in the future. However, it is an admitted fact that the Petitioners have already instituted an action in the District Court bearing No. DSP 99/2018 (P 17(i)) seeking relief regarding the agreement between the NFC and the private circuits. According to P 17(i) the reliefs sought inter-alia are that the agreements are valid, binding, operative, and in force. Further, a declaration that the agreements cannot be unilaterally terminated and/or unilaterally declared null and void. Hence, it appears that the Petitioners have already sought relief from the District Court with respect to the same agreements, the matter in issue in the instant case. Accordingly, the Petitioners themselves have acknowledged that the relationship between the NFC and the private circuits is contractual and resorted to the alternative remedy available.",
