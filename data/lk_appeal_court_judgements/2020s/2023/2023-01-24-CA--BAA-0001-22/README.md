This is an appeal filed against the order of the learned High Court Judge

of the Kuliyapitiya High Court in case No. HCBA/Kuliyapitiya/027/2021

delivered on 13.10.2021. The impugned order refused the bail application

made in terms of section 83(1) of the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance, No. 17 of 1929, as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984

(hereinafter, the Ordinance) on the basis that inter alia, no exceptional

circumstances had been established by the petitioner-appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the appellant).

The facts of the case according to the B Report submitted to Kuliyapitiya

MC are as follows. The suspect has been arrested on 09.09.2020 while

travelling in his car by the police officers who were on duty at a road block.

Upon searching the suspect, 100 grams of Diacetylmorphine alias heroin

has been found in his pocket. The pure quantity of the findings is yet to

be confirmed by the Government Analysts report. The suspect had been

arrested under Section 54(B) of the Ordinance and the learned High Court

Judge of Kuliyapitiya had rejected the bail application of the appellant by

the aforementioned order dated 13.10.2021. It is the contention of the

appellant before this Court that such order is illegal, wrongful, contrary to

law, and unreasonable based on eight grounds submitted by the appellant.

The High Court Judge of Kuliyapitiya had considered the bail application

in an inquiry held on 01.10.2021 where submissions were made by either

party, and the order was reserved for 13.10.2021. However, this Court

observes that two final orders have been issued by the learned High Court

Judge of Kuliyapitiya for the same bail application on the same date, i.e.

13.10.2021. One order is from pp. 69-73 and the other order from pp. 74-

4

BAA-01-22 Page 4 of 7 24/01/2023 IJ-03-23

77 in the Appeal Brief. Nevertheless, both orders have refused the bail

application, even though the content and reasoning are different from one

another.

In perusing the journal entries, a side note on page 54 of the Appeal Brief

indicates that the order was filed on 13.10.2021 ("2021/10/13

. 2021/10/13") and below that note another side note

indicates that proceedings dated 13.10.2021 is filed 11.11 ("2021/10/13

11/11"). It is unclear and ambiguous as to

which order was issued at first and the purpose of issuing a subsequent

order. Furthermore, no reasons have been provided or recorded in this

regard. Once a judgment/order is delivered, it is considered to be the end

of the proceedings as far as the judge who made the decision is concerned

(functus officio). Generally, a judge cannot amend, alter, vary, interpolate

or review his or her judgment or order. However, there are certain

exceptions.

The courts have inherent powers to revise orders under certain

circumstances. In Jeyaraj Fernandopulle vs Premachandra De Silva

and Others, 1996 1 Sri L.R. 70 it was held that, However, all Courts have

inherent power in certain circumstances to revise an order made by them

such as -

(i) An order which has not attained finality according to the law or

practice obtaining in a Court can be revoked or recalled by the Judge or

Judges who made the order, acting with discretion exercised judicially

and not capriciously.

(ii) When a person invokes the exercise of inherent powers of the Court,

two questions must be asked by the Court:

(a) Is it a case which comes within the scope of the inherent powers

of the Court?

(b) Is it one in which those powers should be exercised?

5

BAA-01-22 Page 5 of 7 24/01/2023 IJ-03-23

(iii) A clerical mistake in a judgment or order or some error arising in a

judgment or order from an accidental slip or omission maybe corrected.

(iv) A Court has power to vary its own orders in such a way as to carry

out its own meaning and where the language is doubtful, to make it

plain or to amend it w here a party has been wrongly named or

described but not if it would change the substance of the judgment.

(v) A judgment against a dead party or non-existent Company or in

certain circumstances a judgment entered in default or of consent will

be set aside.

(vi) The attainment of justice is a guiding factor.

(vii) An order made on wrong facts given to the prejudice of a party will

be set aside by way of remedying the injustice caused.

It is the view of this Court that, if a judge is to issue a subsequent final

order on the same matter due to per incuriam or such other instances

which warrants a correction as elaborated in the aforementioned case, it

has to be properly rectified with reasons, proper recording, and giving due

notice to the relevant parties. If such a process is not followed, then both

orders are deemed to be vitiated. The situation becomes highly complicated

when both orders are issued on the same date as has occurred in the

instant application. In the instant matter, there are two specific orders,

with no means of identifying which order was issued at first and which

was issued subsequently.

As filing two final orders/judgments for the same matter is a rare

occurrence, not provided for by the statutory laws, this Court would like

to resort to Indian jurisprudence at this juncture which has previously

dealt with a similar situation. In Behari Lal and Another Vs M.M.

Gobardhan Lal and Others AIR 1948 All 353, Raghubar Dayal J. states

that,

6

BAA-01-22 Page 6 of 7 24/01/2023 IJ-03-23

It is within the realm of possibility that the reviewing Court and the

appellate Court may finally dispose of the review and the appeal without

knowing the existence of the other. What would be then the legal position

about the two orders? It may be said that whichever order was decided first

would be operative and the subsequent order would be held to have been

passed without jurisdiction. It may be argued that the order of the appellate

Court should be preferred to the order of the reviewing Court. It would be

very difficult if the two orders happen to be passed on one and the same

date because it would not be possible then to piece the two orders according

to their respective priority in time. Surely such a remote possibility could not

have been contemplated by the Legislature without providing for it and the

interpretation of the various provisions of the Civil Procedure Code should,

if possible, be such as to avoid the happening of such a contingency in which

it would be difficult to see as to which order should be treated as a valid

order and which should not be treated as a valid order.

In the above case the Court makes a determination on a matter where

there are two judgements by two different judges by way of review and

appeal. The circumstances of the instant case are not quite similar to the

facts of the above case, and are more intricate. The same judge has

delivered two orders on the same date. As she enters the subsequent order

(if it was entered following the proper processes), the first order vitiates.

No judge is entitled to issue two judgments on the same exact issue.

Therefore, it is impossible for this Court to determine which order of the

learned High Court judge is operative for this appeal as both final orders

are issued on the same date. Thus, as the legality of the orders issued by

the High Court Judge being is in doubt.

Therefore, this Court deems both orders by the learned High Court Judge

of Kuliyapitiya dated 13.10.2021 to be invalid. The conduct of the learned

High Court Judge is condemned by this Court as it is found to be

deleterious in administering justice efficiently. It is expected from all

judges to exhibit and promote high standards of judicial conduct so as to

reinforce public confidence, which is the cornerstone of judicial

7

independence. It is an irrevocable duty of a judge to act with due diligence

and assiduousness at all times in a manner that promotes public

confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the

judiciary.

This Court rescinds the purported order/s. The appellant may file a fresh

application, if he is so advised, in a proper forum, as per the changes

brought about by the newly enacted Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs (Amendment) Act, No. 41 of 2022.
