Before: Menaka Wijesundera J.

Neil Iddawala J.

Counsel: V. Dharmasena Vidyaratne for the Petitioner.

Ridma Kuruwita, SC for the Respondents.

Argued on: 18.01.2023

Decided on: 21.02.2023

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The suspect petitioner in the instant matter has been produced before

the Magistrate for offences of rape and abduction of a 15 year old girl.

The petitioner had been produced before the Magistrate for an

identification parade on 19.4.2022 and the victim and parents had come

for the parade. The parents of the victim and victim herself allege that

they were threatened by the petitioner and the accused in the main case

asking them to withdraw the case.

The above complaint had been lodged against the suspects and the police

had produced them before the Magistrate under the provisions of

Assistance to and Protection of Victims and Witnesses act as such they

had been remanded by the Magistrate.

The Counsel for the suspect stated that although the suspect was

arrested and produced under the instant act meaningful action is yet to

be taken against the suspect by the authorities.

The law pertaining to the instant matter is that if a suspect is to be

enlarged on bail under this act, he has to show exceptional circumstances

to be considered by the Court of Appeal.

The term exceptional has not been defined in the act but in the cases so

far decided, it has been held that exceptionality of circumstances have to

be determined case by case.

In the instant matter we observe that the complainant had been

threatened while trying to participate in a judicial proceeding, hence it is

a blatant violation of the fundamental purposes of the act.

As such this Court is of the opinion that considering the tender age of the

victim this Court is of the opinion that the instant application should not

be considered at this juncture.

As such the instant application for bail is dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Neil Iddawala J.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
