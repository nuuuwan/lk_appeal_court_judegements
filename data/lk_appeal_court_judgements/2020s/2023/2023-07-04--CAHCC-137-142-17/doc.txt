The Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) along with

Pathinathan Divadayalan 3rd Accused and Munungoda Hewage Wijesinghe 8th Accused,

(both acquitted after trial) were indicted for the commission of an offence punishable

under the provision of Section 2 of the Convention against Torture and other Cruel,

Inhuman or Degrading Treatment Act No. 22 of 1994 read with the provisions of Section

32 of the Penal Code for torturing Sriskandarajah Sumanan(hereinafter rereferred to as

the deceased) whilst detained in custody on suspicion of the commission of robbery along

with 4 other accused persons during the 25th of November 2011 and 28th of November 2011

in order to obtain information or confession or intimidate or force him to do something or

discriminating him.

On 19th of October 2016 except the 7th accused all others were present and pleaded not

guilty to the charge. Thereafter steps were taken in terms of Section 241 of the Code of

criminal procedure and proceeded the case against the 7th Accused in his absence

however he was represented by the Attorney At Law in terms of the provision Section

241(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The prosecution lead 10 witnesses along with the Judicial Medical Officer and

Closed its case with documents marked P1 to P11B. The Accused gave dock statements.

Both prosecution and defence made submissions.

On the 3rd of May 2017, the Learned High Court judge delivered the judgement

finding the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th guilty to the charge and imposed a sentence of 10

years of imprisonment, fined, awarded compensation and acquitted the 3rd and 8th

Accused.

Being aggrieved by the said judgement and sentence the accused preferred this

appeal.

On the 8th of May 2023 When the matter came for argument the counsel for the 7th

accused informed that since the other accused have already served their sentences they

are not canvasing this appeal.

Page 4 of 11

The following are the Grounds of Appeal urged by the accused in their written submission.

1. The Learned trial Judge has not considered the favourable evidence to the

Appellants.

2. The Learned trial Judge has not considered the defence of the Appellants.

3. The Learned trial Judge has also misdirected himself in analysing the evidence

against the Appellants and has failed to consider the evidence adduced by the

Appellants and witnesses.

4. The evidence led by the prosecution, if properly evaluated by court, could have led

to the acquittal of the Appellants.

5. The Learned trial judge has not considered the contradictions of the prosecution

witnesses.

6. The Concept of proof beyond reasonable doubt was not properly applied to the facts

of the case.

Before we analyse the evidence lead at the trial it is pertinent to refer to the

relevant section which describes torture.

Section 12 of the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or

Degrading Treatment Act No. 22 of 1994., read as follows;

Torture with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions, means any act

which causes severe pain, whether physical or mental, to any other person, being an act

which is

a. done for any of the following purposes that is to say-

i. Obtaining from such other person or a third person, any information or

confession; or

ii. Punishing such other person for any act which he or a third person has

committed, or is suspected of having committed; or

iii. Intimidating or coercing such other person or a third person; or

b. Done for any reason based on discrimination, and being in every case, an act which

is done by, or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public

officer or other person acting in an official capacity.

In addition to the above, there is a provision available in the Constitution

that prohibits torture.

Page 5 of 11

Article 11 of the constitution reads as follows No person shall be subjected to torture or

to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

Now we have to consider whether the prosecution has led sufficient evidence to establish

a charge of torture beyond reasonable doubt which is punishable under the said act.

The facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that:

According to PW1 Rajadurai Suresh who is an eye witness has stated that he was

arrested on the 23rd of November 2011 by the 1st, 2nd, 7th Accused and other Police officers

for the count of theft. He was held in custody inside a room behind the traffic room

situated at the Chunnakam Police Station. PW1 and the Deceased were confined and

tortured in the same room amongst the agonizing torture endured by PW1 he also

witnessed Sumanan being tied and restrained on a table and was assaulted after he was

suspended above the ground. Sumanan had pleaded not to assault him because he is a

patient under medication. Sumanan died during the course of the torture where he was

seen to have been bleeding from his nose and mouth whilst the 1st, 2nd, 7th Accused and

the other police officers proceeded to assault his lifeless body, after his death the deceased

body was loaded on to a pickup and they departed. It was later revealed that the

deceaseds lifeless body was disposed of in the Iranaimadu tank.

The following excerpt expounds on how the deceased was assaulted by the Accused.

In Page 193-194 of the translated brief;

Q: You said that you and Suman were kept in one room and were tortured, who tortured

you like that.

A: Gopi, Mayuran, Chinthaka Bandara Prasath and another two Sinhala Policemen.

Q: What did they do to you and Suman after detaining both of you?

A: I was asked to be on my knees and tied both my hands behind to a pillar found in the

middle. They tied the hands and legs of Suman to a table and hit him after lifting it up.

They lifted him up tying his legs. He was hanging on one side of the table with his head

and one leg with the table lifted up on both sides. They hit asking where the stolen

Jewellery and cash were when he said that he was a patient and asked them not to hit

him, they hit us both one after the other. It was then he died when he was hit. Even

Page 6 of 11

after his death, they hit his body in a rage continually. Mayuran told the police not to

hit him since he was about to die. Thereafter there was no breathing of Suman and he

lay still. There was bleeding from his nose and mouth. He had died. After he died, they

lowered him and took his body putting it in a pickup. It was after that I was taken to

the residence of the Magistrate.

Q: You said you and Suman were tied inside a room and were assaulted. Do you know

who were the people who assaulted both of you?

A: It was Mayuran, Gopi, Chinthaka Bandara and another two Sinhala Policemen. I

know all of them.

When we consider this evidence, this court observes his evidence was consistent and

there is no contradiction in his evidence. We dont see any reason to disbelieve or reject

his evidence. This court observes the way this witness answered the following question.

The question propounded by the counsel was as to why did he not divert to the judge

when he was produced.

In Page 214 of the translated brief

Q: At that time, you had told about the beating of you. Why didnt you tell the matter of a

person who was beaten to death in your presence.

A: I was in fear of being beaten to death thinking that I too might be killed. Hence I did

not mention it. They said that they would file a new case- a Ganja case.

He has given a reason for the delay in providing the relevant information. This

court accepts the explanation given by the witness.

This court is mindful of how our courts take into consideration with regard to these

belated statements.

In Dharmasiri vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka 2012 (1) SLR 268 Tilakawardane, J held

inter alia;

"Two critical tests before considering belated evidence as reliable evidence are: firstly

reasons for delay and secondly, whether those reasons are justifiable."

Page 7 of 11

In Dharmasiri v Republic of Sri Lanka the Court of Appeal (2010 (2) SLR 241)

Sisira de Abrew, J held inter alia;

"Because the witness is a belated witness, Court ought not to reject his testimony

on that score alone. Court must inquire into the reason for the delay and if the reason for

the delay is plausible and justifiable the Court could ad on the evidence of the belated

witness."

It is clear that the reason for PW1s delay in implicating the accused was due to

the fear of his own safety. This court accepts the reason for delaying which is

justifiable. Therefore this court could act on the evidence of the belated witness.

On careful consideration of this evidence, this witness version is

intrinsically credible. We dont see any reason for the witness to have forcefully

implicated this accused, also theres no suggestion presented by the accused. This

witnesss version of the evidence is well supported by the evidence corroborated by

PW3 and PW26 the Judicial medical officer.

According to the evidence delivered by PW3 namely Thurairasa Logeswaran, he

expounds that he was arrested by the Chunnakam police by the 1st, 2nd Accused and other

Police officers for commemorating the Maveerars and for robbery with 4 other suspects

on the 21st of November 2011, and was held in custody for 5 days where he was tortured

by the methods of Electrocution with wires.

On the day of the arrest was the first time he had met the deceased Sriskandarajah

Sumanan where he was held in a separate room, although he didnt see the deceased being

beaten he identified that the deceased was bleeding from his forehead when brought by

the 1st and 2nd Accused passing PW3s cell on the 24th of November 2011.

Page 184 of the translated brief

Q: When you were detained in the police station, when did you see Sumanan for the 1st

time?

A: On the 24th.

Page 8 of 11

Q: In what condition did you see him?

A: I saw him bleeding from his forehead. I saw Sumanan when he was brought by police

officer Chinthaka Bandara and Mayuran.

Q: Did you see Sumanan in the Police Station thereafter?

A: I did not see him.

It is evident that when this witness was cross examined two contradictions were

marked. This court has to consider whether the said contradictions have created any

doubt to disbelieve or reject this witness.

This court is mindful of the dictum of Sisira De Abrew J with regard to the

contradiction.

In Oliver Dayananda Kalansuriya alias Raja Vs The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka, CA 28/2009 decided on 13.2.2013, His lordship held:

His conduct is, therefore, in my view, very much compatible with a conduct of a normal

human being.

It is an accepted principle that a criminal case cannot be proved with a

mathematical accuracy as it has to be proved by the evidence given by human witnesses.

Thus discrepancies, errors and contradiction are bound to occur. If they do not create a

reasonable doubt in the prosecution case court should disregard them. Courts should not

reject evidence of witnesses on the basis of minor discrepancies and contradictions.

In light of the above said authority, the said contradictions have not created any

doubt to disbelieve or reject this witness.

The following observation made by PW26 Dr. Ramesh Alagiyawanna who conducted

the postmortem on the 28th of November 2011 of the deceased Sriskandarajah Sumanan

with regard to the injuries sustained in his body corroborated with the version of PW1.

The following excerpt from his evidence is reproduced below.

Page 9 of 11

In Page 319-320 of the translated brief;

Q: Explain about the 4th part.

A: Based on my examination especially after I peeled the skin, I was able to observe

many multiple muscular contusions. They were not grievous injuries. I arrived at a

conclusion that they had been caused by blunt weapon (blunt force trauma). They had

been caused by force used with blunt weapons.

Q: That is if it is said that attacking with a clenched fist using force, could that be said

as a force.

A: Yes.

Q: Can this take place when using a pole or as you say, using force with a blunt weapon?

A: Yes.

Q: You said you observed few injuries in the buttocks of the deceased in your

Postmortem Report. In your opinion, what would have been the condition of the victim

so as to make these injuries.?

A: These injuries could be caused when attacking a person who is bending forward on

the buttocks or where a person. Falls in such a manner that his buttocks hit the ground.

Q: Are there possibilities of internal injuries from 09-16 when that persons legs and

hands are tied in the front?

A: Those injuries could take place when a persons hands are tied and by falling

continually when that person is attacked by another.

Q: Are all the external injuries mentioned from 01-06, abrasions?

A: Yes.

Page 10 of 11

Q: Are there possibilities for the said abrasion from 1-6 to occur while a person is kept

tied or while pulsing that person in that position with force.

A: Yes. Both the 3rd and 6th external injuries had similar marks. External injuries

No,01,02,04,05 had been caused by using a weapon with a rough surface or with a

weapon is used on the body.

The above said medical evidence corroborates with the evidence of PW1s version

that PW1 had seen the way the Accused assaulted the deceased with blunt weapons.

Therefore, this court accepts PW1s Evidence as reliable and truthful.

The other point taken in by the Defence is whether the learned High Court Judge

has rightly evaluated the dock statement. In this regard, the relevant excerpt from the

judgement is reproduced below. (On page 449 451 of the translated Brief Judgment

dated 03.05.2017);

The Dock Statement of the 1st accused corroborated most of the evidence of the

prosecution witnesses. This is a charge made of torture. It is important that the accused

had not mentioned anything about the charge in his dock statement.

The 2nd accused in his dock statement had denied that he was engaged in

assaulting or threatening Sumanan and denied the torture charge. The dock statement of

the 2nd accused made above corroborated most of the evidence of the Prosecution

witnesses.

The Court rejects the claim of the accused that he did not engage in torturing.

The 3rd accused and the 8th accused had given dock statements. Their dock

statements are that of credibility.

The 4th, 5th, and the 6th accused having made the dock statement, had denied the

charges. Their dock statements are found to be unreliable. Therefore the Court rejects the

dock statement as unreliable.

Page 11 of 11

On analysing this excerpt, we are of the view that the learned High Court Judge

has rightly considered the dock statement and their Defence. We hold that the learned

Trial Judge has correctly concluded that the dock statement has not created any

reasonable doubt in the evidence of the Prosecution.

Additionally, the Accused has not been successful in establishing any of the limbs

set out in the dictum of Shah J. in the case of Kirpal Singh v The State of Uttar Pradesh

AIR (1965) SC 712, which was insisted upon by our courts. For the purpose of convenience,

it is pertinent to set out the said dictum of Shah J;

"The conclusion recorded by the Court of First Instance and affirmed by the High

Court is based upon appreciation of evidence and no question of law arises therefrom.

Normally this Court does not proceed to review the evidence in appeals in criminal cases,

unless the trial is vitiated by some illegality or irregularity of procedure or the trial is

held in a manner violative of the rules of natural justice resulting in an unfair trial or

unless the judgment under appeal has resulted in gross miscarriage of justice. "

Considering the same, this Court is of the view that the Accused has failed to

satisfy us of any such gross miscarriage of justice. Therefore, we see no reason to interfere

with the judgment dated 03.05.2017. The conviction and the sentence are affirmed, and

the appeal is accordingly dismissed.
