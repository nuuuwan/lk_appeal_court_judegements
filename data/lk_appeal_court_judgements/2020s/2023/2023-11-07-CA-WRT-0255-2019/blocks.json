The Petitioner further states that in terms of Section 68 (2) of the Land Development Ordinance, a nominated successor has to enter into possession of the land within six months from the death of the spouse of the original permit holder, and failing which it would amount to a failure to succession. In this case, since the 4th Respondent failed to enter into possession within six months from the death of the spouse of the original permit holder, the 4th Respondent has lost his rights as the successor. In those circumstances, the Petitioner states that the decision made by the 1st Respondent to insert the name of the 4th Respondent as the permit holder of the land in suit is contrary to the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance. Hence, the contention of the Petitioner is that not holding an inquiry to determine the rights to the lands and abandoning the steps taken for cancellation of the permits already issued to the 4th Respondent are ultra-vires.",

The 4th Respondent, in paragraph 16 of his affidavit denied the aforesaid position of the Petitioner and further averred that as the duly nominated successor the 4th Respondent had the constructive possession of the lands and enjoyed the benefits, though the Petitioner was also living in the house with the parents. It is pertinent to note that having accepted the possession of the 4th Respondent in respect of the lands in dispute, the 1st Respondent had issued permits to the 4th Respondent. Subsequently, the relevant Grama Niladari of the Division within which the paddy land pertaining to the Permit P12 is situated reported to the 1st Respondent that the 4th Respondent was not in possession of the paddy land and was also not developing the same (R4). Accordingly, under Section 106 of the said Ordinance, having issued a show cause notice to the 4th (R6) Respondent, the 1st Respondent had already initiated steps to cancel the permit P12. Since there is no report from the Grama Niladari or materials before the 1st Respondent as to the fact that the 4th Respondent is not in possession of the high land(P11), the 1st Respondent has not taken steps under Section 106 of the said Ordinance in respect of the high land (P11).",
