The trial at the High Court commenced on 30.09.2020. Although PW1

started to give evidence but could not complete his evidence due to covid

-19 pandemic and some other difficulties faced by the country.

Though the Petitioner had made several applications for bail before the

High Court of Colombo, he was not granted bail by the Learned High

Court Judge. Lastly, he had applied for bail on 03.02.2022 and after an

inquiry, the Learned High Court Judge had refused bail on the same day.

Aggrieved by the said order, the Petitioner had filed this Revision

Application to revise the said order.

The Petitioner filing this Application has invoked the jurisdiction of this

Court to grant bail to him upon suitable condition as this Court considers

appropriate.

Despite the fact that the Learned DSG contended about the

maintainability of this application before this Court in view of the recently

amended Act No. 41 of 2022 to the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance, this Court has decided to consider this application as a bail

application as the Petitioner only seeks bail for him.

The Section 83 of the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance which was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states:

83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under sections

54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail by the High

Court except in exceptional circumstances.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 84 and 85, a person

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A

and section 54B-

(a) of which the pure quantity of the dangerous drug, trafficked,

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A;

and

CA(PHC)APN 76-2022

4 | P a g e

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment, shall not be

released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in exceptional

circumstances.

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in exceptional

circumstances.

In this case, the pure quantity of Heroin detected in the production by

the Government Analyst is 5947 grams. Therefore, by virtue of the new

amendment to the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, this

Court has jurisdiction to consider granting of bail.

On 07.03.2017, the Petitioner was arrested by officers from the Colombo

Crime Division alleging that he had aided and abetted the 1st Accused

named above to traffic 5947 grams of Heroin (Diacetylmorphine). The

Petitioner was arrested at Pallanhena Junction, Kochchikade since he

was suspected to be the driver of the car bearing No.WP KO 7261 which

was the suspected vehicle alleged to have been used for the

transportation of Heroin. According to the Petitioner, he was arrested

solely upon the information given by the 1st Accused.

The 1st Accused named in the Petition was arrested on 06.03.2017 and

was produced to the Magistrate Court of Maligakanda under Section

54A(b) and 54A(c) of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance

as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 and a detention order was obtained

for further investigations under Section 82(3) of the said Act.

The production had been sent to the Government Analyst Department on

07/03/2017. After analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded the

report to Court on 20/12/2017. According to the Government Analyst,

5947 grams of pure Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) had been detected from

the substance sent for the analysis.

The contention of the prosecution is that the Petitioner was the driver of

the vehicle bearing No. WP KO 7261 in which the Heroin had been

transported to Colombo. According to the Petitioner, no illegal substance

CA(PHC)APN 76-2022

5 | P a g e

was recovered either from him or inside the vehicle at the time he was

taken into custody by the officers of the Colombo Crime Division.

According to the Government Analyst, no traces of Heroin was found in

the vehicle referred above. The Petitioner further alleges that according

to the evidence given by PW1 so far in the High Court Colombo Case

bearing No. 624/2019 does not reveal any evidence regarding his

complicity.

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in

support of his Revision Application.

1. The Learned Trial Judge has erred in law by failing to consider the

facts, material evidence and the circumstances averred by the

Petitioner in the bail application made by his Counsel to the High

Court.

2. The Learned Trial Judge has erred in law by failing to consider the

exceptional circumstances in this regard.

3. The Learned Trial Judge has erred in law by failing to consider the

fact that the Petitioner did not have possession of Heroin at any

time.

4. The Learned Trial Judge has erred in law by failing to consider the

facts that the Petitioner was indicted only for conspiracy and aiding

and abetting for the alleged offence of the 1st Accused.

5. The Learned Trial Judge has erred in law by failing to consider the

facts that the Petitioner was arrested solely on the alleged

information given by the 1st Accused.

6. The Learned Trial Judge has erred in law by failing to consider the

facts that the 3rd and 4th Accused who are husband and wife and

was indicted for the similar offences of the Petitioner were granted

bail on 10.12.2019 and 17.12.2021 respectively, thereby treated

the Petitioner in unequal and unfairly between accused persons

and therefore creating a discrimination.

CA(PHC)APN 76-2022

7. The Learned Trial Judge has erred in law by failing to consider that

there would be a substantial miscarriage of justice to the Petitioner

in the event, that if he is not enlarged on bail.

8. The Learned Trial Judge has erred in law by failing to consider the

fact that the right to a fair trial of the Petitioner was violated.

9. The Learned Trial Judge has erred in law by failing to consider the

facts that though the said indictment was filed on 19.08.2019, only

half of the evidence-in-chief of PW1 had been led.

10. The Learned Trial Judge has erred in law by failing to consider the

fact that the Petitioner has been in remand custody for over 5

years and 4 months.

According to the Learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG), the Petitioner

was arrested in connection of aiding and abetting the 1st Accused for

trafficking of 5947 grams of Heroin. Indictment had already been filed in

the High Court of Colombo and the case number is HC 624/2019. The

trial has already begun and PW1 has started to give evidence. Hence,

Learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that the delay is not an

exceptional circumstance to be considered to enlarge the suspect on bail.

Further, the time spent for preparing the indictment does not constitute

an exceptional circumstance.

The Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the

suspect has been in remand for more than five years. Considering the

facts and the circumstances of this case, the prosecution will not be able

to establish a prima facie case against the Petitioner.

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what is

exceptional circumstances must be considered on its own facts and

circumstances on a case by case. Due care must be exercised after taking

into account the facts and circumstances of each case.

CA(PHC)APN 76-2022

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

In CA(PHC) APN 17/12 and CA(PHC) APN 16/12 the court observed the

fact that indictment was not served even after the laps of one year from

the producing of the Government Analysts Report was considered as

exceptional circumstances.

In CA(PHC)APN 107/2018 decided on 19.03.2019 held that remanding

for a period of one year and five months without being served with the in

indictment was considered inter alia in releasing the suspect on bail.

According to the Petitioner, at present his family is going through untold

hardship without proper income and care. His sister and father both are

medically condemned persons. At present only his mother is looking after

them. To support his claim medical reports of his sister and father are

attached to the petition.

The Counsel for the Petitioner had drawn the courts attention regarding

some circumstances which are certainly going to affect the prosecutions

case. The Learned DSG opposing this submission submitted that the

evidence or circumstances should not be considered when adjudicating

a bail application.

In Nasher v. Director of Public Prosecution [2020] VSCA 144 the court

held that:

a combination of delay, onerous custodial conditions, and the

relative weakness of the prosecution case may, when considered

with all relevant circumstances, compel the conclusion that exceptional

circumstances have been established. [Emphasis added]

In a bail inquiry when the Petitioner brings to the notice of the Court the

circumstances which could be capable of shaking the prosecution case,

CA(PHC)APN 76-2022

8 | P a g e

the Court has the discretion to tentatively look to the facts and

circumstances of the case to ascertain whether a reasonable ground

exists or not either to grant or refuse bail. The Court should not probe

into the merits of the case, but restrict itself to the material placed before

it. But, even for the purpose of bail any benefit of doubt arising in the

case must accrue to the Petitioner.

Dr.A.R.B.Amerasinghe in his book titled Judicial Conduct, Ethics

and Responsibilities at page 284 observes that:

However, Article 13(5) of our Constitution states that every person

shall be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty. Article 13(2)

further provides that a person shall not be deprived of personal liberty

except upon and in terms of the order of a judge made in accordance

with procedure established by law.

The State imposes a punishment on the suspect indirectly by keeping

him in remand custody for an uncertain period. Obviously, that was

not the intention of the legislature when it enacted Article 13(5) of the

Constitution.

One of the grounds urged by the Petitioner is that the Learned Trial Judge

has erred in law by failing to consider the facts that the Petitioner was

arrested solely on the alleged information given by the 1st Accused.

If the prosecution does not have any incriminating evidence against the

Petitioner other than the confessional statement of the co-accused, this

circumstance could be considered in adjudicating his bail application.

Next, considering the fact that there has been a delay of more than 5

years since the remand, it falls into the category of excessive and

oppressive delay taking into account the circumstances of this case.

Although the Government Analyst Report was received by the Magistrate

Court of Maligakanda on 20.12.2017, the Hon. Attorney General had

forwarded the indictment only on 10.01.2019.

CA(PHC)APN 76-2022

9 | P a g e

Further, granting bail to 3rd and 4th Accused who are husband and wife

and was indicted for the similar offences of the Petitioner at the very early

stage, rendered that the Petitioner had been treated in an unequal and

unfairly manner which certainly created a discrimination among the

Accused and the Petitioner.

Offences under Section 54A(b) of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is no doubt

serious offences but seriousness of the offence alone cannot form a

ground to refuse bail. In considering these matters, the court must bear

in mind the presumption of innocence.

Further, bail should never be withheld as punishment. Granting of bail

is primarily at the discretion of the Courts. The discretion should be

exercised with due care and caution taking into account the facts and

circumstances of each case.

Considering the above factors, this court has come to a conclusion that

the Petitioner has established exceptional grounds for the granting of

bail. Hence, the Petitioner is granted bail with following condition.

1. Cash bail of Rs.50,000/=.

2. To provide 02 sureties. They must sign a bond of two million each.

3. The suspect and the sureties must reside in the address given until

conclusion of his case.

4. Not to approach any prosecution witnesses directly or indirectly or

to interfere with.

5. To surrender his passport if any, to court and not to apply for a

travel document. The Controller of the Immigration and Emigration

is informed of the travel ban on the Petitioner.

6. To report to the Colombo Crime Division, Colombo-09 on the last

Sunday of every month between 9am to 1pm.

7. Any breach of these conditions is likely to result in the cancellation

of his bail.
