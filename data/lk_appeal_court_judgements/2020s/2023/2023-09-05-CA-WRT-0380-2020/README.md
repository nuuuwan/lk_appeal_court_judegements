De Abrew, ASG and Manohara Jayasinghe, DSG for the Respondents. Argued on: 08.02.2023 Written Submissions on: 02.06.2023 by the Petitioner Not tendered by the Respondents Decided on: 05.09.2023 MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioner is seeking, inter-alia, a Writ of Certiorari quashing the

decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as

the AAT) dated 23-10-2018 and a Writ of Mandamus directing the AAT to

allow the appeal preferred by the Petitioner.

On 12-04-2010, IP Pushpalal and his team of Officers of the Kahawatte

Police apprehended a lorry for the offence of transporting beef without a

permit and brought the same to the Police Station. The allegation leveled

against the Petitioner was that the Petitioner, without initiating any legal

action against the persons who had transported beef without a valid

permit, instructed IP Pushpalal to release the said vehicle, persons and

beef, thereby the Petitioner had committed an offence punishable under

section 4 (4) of the appendix to the Police Department Orders A 7B.

Moreover, uttering the falsehood that he did not instruct IP Pushpalal to

release the vehicle, persons and the beef, which is punishable under

section 5 (B) of the Disciplinary Code in the appendix to Police Department

Orders A 7B.

As per the preliminary investigation report of ASP Amarasingha dated 11-

10-2012, marked and produced as P15, it transpired that the Petitioner

had instructed the lorry to be released despite the lorry not having a

license to transport cattle meat. Accordingly, the Petitioner was charge-

sheeted on 30-12-2012 for neglect of duty and prevarication (P16).

Thereafter, a disciplinary inquiry was held against the Petitioner. As per

the disciplinary inquiry report of SSP Palitha Fernando dated 03-11-2014

marked as P19, the Petitioner was found guilty of charge N0.1, neglect of

duty and found not guilty for charge N0.2, prevarication, and accordingly,

the Inspector General of Police by Order dated 02-05-2015 imposed the

punishment as follows (P20);

1. Deferment of Salary increment by one year.

2. To pay Rs. 30,000/- in 24 months installment.

Being aggrieved by the disciplinary Order, the Petitioner appealed to the

Public Service Commission, thereupon, the same was forwarded by the

Page 7 of 11

said Commission to the National Police Commission. The National Police

Commission on 24-01-2017 decided to remove the Rs. 30,000/- fine

imposed by the Inspector General of Police and affirmed the rest of the

aforesaid punishment. Being aggrieved by the said decision, the Petitioner

preferred an appeal to the AAT, whereas the AAT by Order dated 23-10-

2018 dismissed the appeal and affirmed the Disciplinary Order of the IGP

marked as P20. In these circumstances, the Petitioner states that the

Order of the AAT is arbitrary, capricious, illegal, unreasonable, irrational

and against the rules of natural justice.

It is pertinent to be noted that this is not an appeal and this is a judicial

review. How does one differentiate between an appeal and a judicial

review? In a judicial review proceeding we challenge the way in which the

decision was made, rather than whether the decision or the conclusion

reached is correct. In this way, judicial review is not really concerned with

the conclusion; it focuses more so on the procedures that have been

followed. A review is not a statutory right of the people and is at the

discretion of the court, which can reject the request. A review is based on

procedural irregularity, impropriety, irrationality, and illegality. In judicial

review the Court will not annalize the evidence adduced and whether the

decision was in accordance with the evidence adduced, which has to be

considered in an appeal.

With an Appeal, you can challenge the courts decision by appealing it at

a higher court than the one that passed the verdict. An appeal is a plea for

the matter to be judged again. An appeal is requested to ask the higher

court to change the decision of the lower court. The decision of the lower

court can stay the same or the Higher Court can change it.

It was argued by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that even though

the National Police Commission had removed the punishment No. 2,

imposing a fine of Rs. 30,000/-, by the IGP, the AAT has reimposed the

same which is totally illegal, irrational and unreasonable.

It is evident from the report marked as P19, a disciplinary inquiry was

properly conducted by SSP Palitha Fernando, and accordingly, having

considered the oral and documentary evidence adduced, the Petitioner was

found guilty of charge No.1 and observed that charge No.2 was not

established. Having scrutinized the report marked P19, the IGP issued a

Disciplinary Order against the Petitioner, namely Deferment of Salary

Increment by one year and a fine of Rs. 30,000/-to be paid in 24 months

installments.

It is to be noted that the National Police Commission, without adducing

any reasons, had removed the fine of Rs. 30,000/- imposed by the IGP in

his well-considered Order based on Report P19. Hence the decision of the

National Police Commission is arbitrary, illegal and unreasonable. Even

the Petitioner, in paragraph 37 of the Petition conceded to the fact that the

National Police Commission has not furnished any reasons for its

determination.

In Choolanie Vs. Peoples Bank1 the Supreme Court observed that;

Satisfactory reasons should be given for administrative decisions. A

decision not supported by adequate reasons is liable to be quashed

by Court.

Per Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, J.

1 2008 (2) SLR 93

Page 9 of 11

"...... giving reasons to an administrative decision is an important

feature in today's context, which cannot be lightly disregarded.

Furthermore, in a situation, where giving reasons have been ignored,

such a body would run the risk of having acted arbitrarily in coming

to their conclusion.

In light of the above determination of the Supreme Court, it is the view of

this Court that the decision of the National Police Commission to vary the

punishment imposed by the IGP without any reasons is arbitrary and

therefore liable to be set aside in-limine. In this context, the decision of the

AAT, without adhering to the decision of the National Police Commission

and reaffirming the Disciplinary Order of the IGP is reasonable and

justifiable in law.

Having scrutinized the Order of the AAT marked as P23, it is manifestly

clear that the AAT has properly considered the evidence adduced at the

Disciplinary inquiry before making its Order. IP Pushpalal in his evidence

categorically stated that he was ordered by the Petitioner to release the

vehicle, persons and the beef, and accordingly, he did so. At this point, the

Petitioner had an opportunity to contradict and disprove the evidence of

Pushpala. It is to be noted that the Petitioner opted not to give evidence

and not to call witnesses to establish his case. Under section 114 (f) of the

Evidence Ordinance, the Court may presume that evidence that could be

and is not produced would if produced, be unfavorable to the person who

withholds it. In the case of Rodrigo Vs. St.Anthonys Ltd2 the Supreme

Court enunciated that;

2 1995 (1SLR) 07

Page 10 of 11

the first defendant did not give evidence and the Court is entitled to

draw the presumption that, had he given evidence, such evidence

would have been unfavorable to the case of the defendant.

The Supreme Court of India in the Case of the Registrar of Delhi

University vs Ashok Kumar Chopra, on 9 October, 1967-ILR 1968

Delhi 364, observed that; Where there is an inherent duty of one person

to inform the other person of accurate facts and circumstances but remains

silent, his failure to discharge this duty will work as estoppels against him.

Moreover, the AAT has rightly observed that the preliminary investigation

had been conducted by a Gazetted Officer on the Order of the SSP

Ratnapura Division and the Charge sheet was issued by the IGP. As such,

the investigation and the inquiry into the allegations against the Petitioner

have been conducted in accordance with the law. The AAT rightly further

observed that in commensurate with the serious nature of the charges, the

finding of guilt of the Petitioner on charges No. I and II and the punishment

imposed on the Petitioner are correct.

In the case of Jayaweera Vs. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian

Services3 it was held that;

There is a presumption that official and legal Acts are regularly and

correctly performed.

Per Jayasuriya, J.

" A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a

Writ of Certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a

matter of right or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief,

still the Court has the discretion to deny him relief having regard to his

3 1996 (2) SLR 70.

Page 11 of 11

conduct, delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction - are all valid

impediments which stand against the grant of relief."

For the above reasons, I am of the view that there is no basis to

interfere with the Order of the AAT dated 23-10-2018. Thus, the

Application is dismissed without costs.

Application dismissed.
