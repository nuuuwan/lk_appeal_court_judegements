JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted by the Attorney General under

Sections 354 and 365 B (2) (b) of the Penal Code for committing the offence

of Kidnapping from lawful guardianship and Grave Sexual Abuse on

Kankanam Kapuge Tharushika on 02/06/2013.

The trial commenced on 12/02/2018. After leading all necessary witnesses,

the prosecution closed the case. The learned High Court Judge had called

for the defence and the Appellant had made statement from the dock and

closed his case.

The learned High Court Judge after considering the evidence presented by

both parties before him and his predecessor, convicted the Appellant as

charged, and sentenced the Appellant to 05 years of rigorous imprisonment

and imposed a fine of Rs.5000/- subject to a default sentence of 03 months

simple imprisonment for the first count.

For the second count the Appellant was sentenced to 12 years of rigorous

imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs.5000/- subject to a default sentence

of 06 months simple imprisonment.

3 | P a g e

In addition, a compensation of Rs.300000/- was ordered with a default

sentence of 03 years rigorous imprisonment. The Learned High Court Judge

had further ordered the sentences imposed on count one and two to run

concurrent to each other.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. During the argument he was connected via Zoom platform from

prison.

The Facts of this case albeit briefly are as follows.

According to PW1 - the victim of this case, she had been about 08 years old

when she faced this bitter ordeal. When she gave evidence, she was 12 years

old and was schooling. The victim and her other two siblings had been

staying with the grandparents at the time of the commission of the offence

as her father had deserted the family when she was a small girl. Her mother

was suffering from a mental illness. Hence, the children were looked after by

the grandparents.

In the afternoon on the day of the incident, being a school holiday, when the

children were playing, the Appellant had called the victim from a distance to

take an axe to the village temple. At that time, the grandparents were not at

home as they had gone for employment. When the victim went near the

Appellant to collect the axe, the Appellant forcibly held her and had taken

under a nearby tree, made her lie on the ground on his sarong laid under

the tree. After removing the skirt and the pair of shorts of the victim, the

Appellant had kept his male organ between her legs close to her vagina and

committed grave sexual abuse on her. Although she resisted, she could not

escape from the captivity of the Appellant. The victim was freed after having

seen the approach of somebody. She had divulged this incident to her

4 | P a g e

grandmother when she came home after two days. By this time, someone

had given an anonymous called to the police under emergency number 119.

The JMO who had examined the victim had opined that the examination

findings of genital area are consistent with alleged sexual abuse involving

genital area.

After the closure of the prosecutions case, the defence was called, and the

Appellant had given statement from the dock and closed his case.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant:

1. The Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself with regard to the

Medical Evidence.

2. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider the failure of the

prosecution to call PW4.

3. The Learned Trial Judge had failed to consider the glaring

contradictions which diminish the credibility of the victim.

In a case of this nature, the testimonial trustworthiness and credibility of

PW1, mainly the probability should be assessed with utmost care and

caution by the trial judge. The learned Trial Judge must satisfy and accept

the evidence of a child witness after assessing her competence and credibility

as a witness. Hence, before analysing the grounds of appeal advanced in this

case, I consider it of utmost importance that the following authorities from

other jurisdictions on the topic be appraised.

It was recognized in England as early as 1778 that children could be

competent witnesses in criminal trials.

5 | P a g e

In R v. Brasier168 Eng. Rep.202 [1779] the court held:

.that an infant, though underage of seven years, may be sworn in

a criminal prosecution, provided such infant appears, on strict

examination by the Court, to possess a sufficient knowledge of the

nature and consequences of an oath for there is no precise or fixed

rule as to the time within which infants are excluded from giving

evidence; but their admissibility depends upon the sense and reason

they entertain of the danger and impiety of falsehood, which is to be

collected from their answers to questions propounded to them by the

Court; but if they are found incompetent to take oath, their testimony

cannot be received ..

In Ratansinh Dalsukhbhai Nayak v. State of Gujarat [2004] 1 SCC 64 the

court held that:

The decision on the question whether the child witness has sufficient

intelligence primarily rests with the trial Judge who notices his manners,

his apparent possession or lack of intelligence, and said Judge may

resort to any examination which will tend to disclose his capacity and

intelligence as well as his understanding of the obligation of an oath.

The decision of the trial court may, however, be disturbed by the higher

Court if from what is preserved in the records, it is clear his conclusion

was erroneous. This precaution is necessary because child witnesses

are amenable to tutoring and often live in a world of make beliefs.

Though it is an established principle that child witnesses are dangerous

witnesses as they are pliable and liable to be influenced easily, shaked

and moulded, but it is also an accepted norm that if after careful scrutiny

of their evidence the Court comes to the conclusion that there is an

impress of truth in it, there is no obstacle in the way of accepting the

evidence of a child witness.

6 | P a g e

In Ranjeet Kumar Ram v. State of Bihar [2015] SCC Online SC 500 the

court held that:

Evidence of the child witness and its credibility would depend upon the

circumstances of each case. Only precaution which the court has to bear

in mind while assessing the evidence of a child witness is that the

witness must be a reliable one.

In R v. Baker EWCA Crim 4 [2010] Lord Chief Justice (England and Wales

of Court of Appeal) held that:

(At para 40) .. We emphasise that in our collective experience the age

of a witness is not determinative on his or her ability to give truthful and

accurate evidence. Like adults some children will provide truthful and

accurate testimony, and some will not. However, children are not

miniature adults, but children, and to be treated and judged for what

they are, not what they will, in years ahead, grow to be. Therefore,

although due allowance must be made in the trial process for the fact

that they are children with, for example, a shorter attention span than

most adults, none of the characteristic of childhood, and none of the

special measures which apply to the evidence of children carry with

them the implicit stigma that children should be deemed in advance to

be somehow less reliable than adults. The purpose of the trial process

is to identify evidence which is reliable and that which is not, whether

it comes from an adult or a child. If competent, as defined by the

statutory criteria, in the context of credibility in the forensic process, the

child witness starts off on the basis of equality with every other witness.

In trial by jury, his or her credibility is to be assessed by the jury, taking

into account every specific personal characteristic which may bear on

the issue of credibility, along with the rest of the available evidence.

7 | P a g e

In R v. B. (G),1990 CanLII 7308 (SCC); [1990] 2 S.C.R. 30, at pp.54-55

the Court held that:

...it seems to me that he was simply suggesting that the judiciary

should take a common-sense approach when dealing with the

testimony of young children and not impose the same exacting

standard on them as it does on adults. However, this is not to say

that the courts should not carefully assess the credibility of child

witnesses and I do not read his reasons as suggesting that the

standard of proof must be lowered when dealing with children as

the appellants submit. Rather, he was expressing concern that a

flaw, such as a contradiction, in a child's testimony should not be

given the same effect as a similar flaw in the testimony of an adult. I

think his concern is well founded and his comments entirely

appropriate. While children may not be able to recount precise

details and communicate the when and where of an event with

exactitude, this does not mean that they have misconceived what

happened to them and who did it. In recent years we have adopted

a much more benign attitude to children's evidence, lessening the

strict standards of oath taking and corroboration, and I believe that

this is a desirable development. The credibility of every witness

who testifies before the courts must, of course, be carefully assessed

but the standard of the "reasonable adult" is not necessarily

appropriate in assessing the credibility of young children.

E.R.S.R Coomaraswamy in his Law of Evidence Volume 2 Book 2 at page

658 has stated referring to child witness;

There is no requirement in English law, that the sworn evidence of a

child witness needs to be corroborated as a matter of law. But the jury

8 | P a g e

should be warned, not to look for corroboration, but of the risks involved

in acting on the sole evidence of young girls and boys, though they may

do so if convinced of the truth of such evidence.This requirement is

based on the susceptibility of children to the influence of others and to

the surrender to their imaginations.

At page 659 it states, As regards the sworn testimony of children, there

is no requirement as in England to warn of the risk involved in acting on

their sole testimony, though it may desirable to issue such a warning,

though the failure to do so will generally not affect the conviction.

Barry Nurcombe, M.D., F.R.A.C.P. in his article The Child as Witnesses:

Competency and Credibility states:

Before the trial, the child is expected to recount the details of the

alleged offense, again and again, to strangers. Repeated court

appearance may be required. In court, the child will eventually be

confronted by the accused who is exercising his or her constitutional

rights. In contrast to the accused, the child has no advocate. His or

her testimony is open to direct challenge on the grounds of

incompetence, confabulation, or fabrication. These considerations

deter victims from reporting offenses, lead to false restrictions, and

erode the apparent credibility of honest witnesses.

Considering the above cited judicial decisions and the writings, as the

credibility of the evidence of a child witness would predominantly depend on

the circumstances of each case, it is the duty of the Learned Trial Judge to

assess and decide on the evidence given by the child witness.

In the first ground of appeal, the Learned Counsel argued that the Learned

High Court Judge misdirected himself about the Medical Evidence.

9 | P a g e

The Learned Counsel drew the attention to the history narrated to the doctor

by the victim. In her history she had said that the Appellant had spread her

legs and licked her vagina and nothing else. But in her evidence, she had

said that the Appellant had kept his male organ on her vagina. Hence the

Counsel argued that the evidence given by the victim is not consistence with

her history to the doctor.

The admissibility of the recorded history in the Medico-Legal Report as

evidence in criminal trials has been discussed in several decided cases.

In Gamini Dolawatte V. Attorney General [1988] 1 Sri. L. R 221 held that:

While a Medico-Legal Report is admissible in evidence under Section

414(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, hearsay evidence by way

of the case history embodied in such a report is not admissible as such

history is information is not ascertained by the Doctor from his own

examination of the injured.

In Bhargavan v.State of Kerala AIR 2004 SC 1058 (Supreme Court of

India)

At para 20: So far as non-disclosure of names to the doctor, same is

really of no consequence. As rightly noted by the Courts below, his

primary duty is to treat the patient and not find out by whom the injury

was caused.

Although the victim had not revealed to the doctor about the sexual abuse

committed on her in her history, the doctor after the genital examination of

the victim found two symmetrical reddish patches, each measuring 3mm X

3mm on inner sides of both labia minora on sides of the hymeneal orifice.

Further, the doctor had opined that the examination findings of genital area

are consistent with alleged sexual abuse involving genital area.

10 | P a g e

As the finding of the doctor is immensely consistent with the evidence given

by the victim in court, there is no justification for undervaluing the victims

testimony in this case. Hence, this ground has no merit at all.

In the second ground of appeal, the Counsel contended that the Learned

High Court Judge had failed to consider the failure of the prosecution to call

PW4.

In King v. Chalo Singho 42 NLR 269 the court held:

Prosecuting Counsel is not bound to call all the witnesses named

on the back of the indictment or tender them for cross-

examination. In exceptional circumstances the presiding Judge

may ask the prosecuting counsel to call such witnesses or may

call him as a witness of the Court.

It is trite law that it is not necessary to call a certain number of witnesses to

prove a fact. However, if court is not impressed with the cogency and the

convincing nature of the evidence of the sole testimony of the witness, it is

incumbent on the prosecution to corroborate the evidence.

In this case, the creditworthiness of the evidence given by the victim did not

suffer at any stage of the trial. No contradictions or omissions were

highlighted in her evidence. The learned High Court Judge had considered

the evidence given by PW1 with caution and care and correctly held that her

evidence is convincing and cogent and sufficient on its own to prove the case

against the Appellant.

The victims evidence is further supported by the evidence given by her

grandmother PW2. In her evidence she said that when she was informed

about the incident to her by the victim, she had confronted with Appellant

immediately. At that time, the Appellant had admitted the crime committed

on the victim. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

Under the cross examination too, PW2 maintained the same which certainly

strengthens the version of the victim. The relevant portion is re-produced

Hence, the argument put forward by the learned Counsel under this ground

of appeal regarding the corroboration cannot be accepted. Further, as stated

above, in this case the prosecution had adduced all necessary witnesses to

prove their case. It is incorrect to say that the prosecution had withheld the

independent witness to prove their case. Due to reasons given above, this

ground is also not successful.

In the final ground of appeal, the Counsel for the Appellant contended that

the Learned Trial Judge had failed to consider the glaring contradictions

which diminishes the credibility of the victim.

Although the Learned Counsel argued that the victim gave contradictory

evidence, not a single contradiction or omission was marked on her evidence

by the defence.

In the examination-in-chief, the victim had said that she was only wearing a

skirt and a pair of shorts and those were the garment the Appellant removed

before committing the offence. But in her cross examination she had said

that she was also wearing underwear and the Appellant removed it as well.

The Learned DSG highlighting this evidence of the victim rightly submitted

that even if this was to be considered as an omission, it is not forceful enough

to shake the credibility of the victim or the core issues of the case against

the Appellant.

In sexual offence cases, corroboration is not a sine qua non to secure a

conviction. As long as the victims evidence does not suffer from ambiguity

or infirmity in a manner which affects the root of the case, there is no bar for

the court to act and rely on the said evidence to decide the case. Hence, this

ground of appeal also devoid any merit.

13 | P a g e

The Learned High Court Judge when writing the judgment had combined the

history given to doctor and the evidence given in court by the victim.

Although this is a misdirection, it had not caused any prejudice to the

Appellant.

Article 138 of The Constitution of Democratic Republic of Sri Lanka

states:

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to

the provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an

appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact

or in law which shall be committed by the High Court, in

the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by

any court of First Instance, Tribunal or other institution

and sole and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal,

revision and restitution in integrum, of all cases, suits,

actions, prosecutions, matters and things of which such

High Court of First Instance, Tribunal or other institution

may have taken cognizance;

Provided that no judgment, decree, or order of any

court shall be revised or varied on account of any

error, defect, or irregularity, which has not prejudiced

the substantial right of the parties or occasioned a

failure of justice. [Emphasis added]

The above-mentioned provision of the Constitution clearly

demonstrates that any failure to adhere to the legal provisions can be

considered only if such failure prejudices the substantial rights of the

parties or occasion a failure of justice.

14 | P a g e

Considering the evidence led in this case and guided by the judgements

mentioned above, I conclude that this is not an appropriate case in which

the judgement delivered by the learned High Court Judge on 18/10/2018

against the Appellant can be interfered upon. I therefore, dismiss the appeal.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgement to

the High Court of Monaragala along with the original case record.
