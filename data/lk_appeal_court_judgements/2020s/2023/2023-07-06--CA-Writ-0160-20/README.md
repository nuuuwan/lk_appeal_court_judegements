Written submissions tendered on: 16.09.2022 for the Petitioner

Argued on: 04.08.2022

Decided on: 06.07.2022

S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner to this Writ Application is the owner of the beef stall and cattle

slaughtering house carried upon an annual license issued under Section 4 of the

Butchers Ordinance No. 9 of 1893 (as amended) (the Ordinance), located at No 96/A,

Panapitiya, Karandeniya. The said business is registered as an individual business under

the Business Names Ordinance (P1) and situated within the Karandeniya Pradeshiya

Sabha area. The Petitioner averred that traditionally his family has been engaged in the

meat trade as a family business and he continued the business from 2007 to 2019 under

the valid licenses issued by the 3rd Respondent, Karandeniya Pradeshiya Sabha (the

respective licenses are marked as P1 to P15). In 2019, for the period from 11.03.2019

to 17.03.2019 a temporary permit has been issued to the Petitioner to slaughter cattle.

However, the temporary permit was not extended nor a new permit was issued to the

Petitioner for the reason that he has failed to fulfil the environmental protection

requirements. Thereafter, the Petitioner duly complied with the directions of the

National Environment Authority and obtained the Environmental Protection License

6

from the National Environmental Authority (P-19) for the period of 11.03.2020 to

10.03.2021. Upon completion of the necessary requirements, the Petitioner applied for

the license from the 3rd Respondent for the cattle slaughtering house as well as for the

meat stall. However, the 3rd Respondent has not issued him the permit. The Petitioner

argues that in terms of section 14 of the Ordinance, once the necessary requirements

are fulfilled, it is mandatory to issue the permit for slaughtering of cattle, and therefore

the decision of the 3rd Respondent not to issue the license is ultra vires and contrary to

the law. It is also contended that the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha, the 1st

Respondent has no authority to appoint a Committee to examine the possibility of

issuing a license to the Petitioner. By this writ Application the Petitioner seeks to issue

a writ of Certiorari quashing the decision mentioned in the letter dated 16.06.2020

marked as P 24 issued by the Secretary of the Pradeshiya Sabha, the 4th Respondent.

By that letter, the 4th Respondent has informed the Petitioner that the Committee

appointed to consider issuing the permit to the Petitioner for the slaughtering house

recommended not to issue the permit and after considering that recommendation the 3rd

Respondent decided to refer the matter to the Commissioner General of Local

Government, the 5th Respondent and until the 5th Respondents instructions are received

not to issue the license. It has been further informed by P 24 that after receiving the

instructions of the 5th Respondent is received steps will be taken to issue the permit

forthwith. The Report of the Committee appointed to consider issuing the license is

tendered to Court by the 1st to 4th Respondents marked as R1. In terms of paragraph

7

xxvi of sub-section, 1 of Section 19 of the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act, No. 15 of 1987 (the

Act) the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha has powers to appoint its Officers to hold

inquiries for any of the purposes of the Act. Accordingly, this Court could be satisfied

that the Chairman of the Pradehsiya Sabha, the 1st Respondent has appointed Members

of the Pradeshiya Sabha, the 8th, 10th, 12th to 14th and 17th Respondents to submit a

Report (R1) regarding the slaughtering house according to the provisions of the Act and

hence the appointment of those Respondents to hold an inquiry is according to law.

When considering the above-stated facts it is clear that the Petitioner is seeking the writ

of Certiorari to quash the decision mentioned in P24 which is not a permanent decision.

The decision taken not to issue the permit is a temporary decision valid until the 3rd

Respondent receives the directions of the 5th Respondent. It is trite law that a writ of

Certiorari can be issued only to quash a final determination of a public body. Since the

decision contained in P 24 is not a final decision the Petitioner is not entitled to a writ

of Certiorari to quash it.

By Section 102 of the Act the Chairman of a Pradeshiya Sabha is empowered with the

discretion to issue, suspend or revoke a license issue to carry on slaughterhouses as to

him may seem necessary. Therefore, since the 1st Respondent being the Chairman of

the Pradeshiya Sabha has a discretion in issuing the license, even if the 5th Respondents

advice is to issue the permit to the Petitioner, considering the conduct of the Petitioner

the 1st Respondent could disregard the advice of the 5th Respondent to issue the permit.

8

The Petitioner has averred in paragraph 9 of the Petition that traditionally his family is

engaged in the meat trade as a family business and the Petitioner is engaged in that

business continuously from 2007. It is borne out by R2 that the son of the Petitioner

had been prosecuted before the Magistrates Court of Balapitiya in two cases for

slaughtering two cows without having a valid license which are offences punishable

under the Ordinance. Apart from that, the Petitioner had been prosecuted before the

High Court of Balapitiya under the Cruelty to the Animals Act for transporting cattle

and after convicting the Petitioner for the offence Court had imposed a fine of Rs.

50,000/-. In terms of Section 8 of the Ordinance, the proper authority upon just and

reasonable grounds could make an order revoking the license granted to any person to

carry on the trade of a butcher. In terms of Section 3 of the Ordinance proper authority

in respect of this writ application is the 1st Respondent. The position of the Respondents

is that the decision of the 1st Respondent not to issue the license to the Petitioner for the

slaughterhouse was taken after considering the violations of the terms of the permits

issued to the Petitioner previously and the Court proceeding against the Petitioner and

his son for violations of the provisions of the Ordinance. Under such circumstances, in

terms of section 8 of the Ordinance, the 1st Respondent is entitled to consider the Court

proceedings against the Petitioner and his son as well as the violations of the conditions

mentioned in the permits issued previously as just and reasonable grounds for not to

issue the license to the Petitioner and refuse to issue the license. Since the meat trade

is a family business of the Petitioner, in terms of Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance

9

the offences committed by the son of the Petitioner also can be considered as offences

committed in respect of the meat business and therefore done by the Petitioner.

Therefore, the decision of the 1st Respondent not to issue license to the Petitioner is

according to law. On the other hand, the Petitioner has not disclosed the Court

proceedings which are material to this writ application. It is also trite law that

suppression of material fact is a ground to refuse an application for writs.

Considering all the above stated facts and circumstances, I hold that the Petitioner is

not entitled to the reliefs sought in the Petition. Writ application is dismissed. The

Petitioner should pay Rs. 50,000/- to the 4th Respondent as costs of this application.
