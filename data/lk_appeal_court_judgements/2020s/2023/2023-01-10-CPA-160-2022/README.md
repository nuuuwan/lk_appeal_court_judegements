Order

The Petitioner-Petitioner is the Mayor of the Kurunegala Municipal Council and the 1st

Respondent-Respondent is the Governor of the North Western Province. 2nd, 3rd and 4th

Respondent-Respondents are Governors Secretary, Chief Secretary North Western

Province and Commissioner of Local Government respectively and 6th Respondent-

Respondent is the Municipal Council of Kurunegala and the 7th Respondent-Respondent

is the Municipal Commissioner of Kurunegala.

It appears that the Petitioner-Petitioner [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Petitioner] had instituted writ application bearing No. HCW 17/2022 in the High Court

of Kurunegala against the 1st-4th Respondent-Respondents [hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents] seeking a writ of Certiorari quashing

the gazette notification bearing No. 2305/12 dated 22.11.2009 marked as P4.

According to the said gazette notification, Governor of the North Western Province

had appointed the 5th Respondent-Respondent [hereinafter referred to as the 5th

Respondent] to inquire and report within a period of three months from the date of

this notification, whether the Mayor of Kurunegala Municipal Council has committed

any offences referred to in Section 277 (1) of the amended Municipal Council Ordinance

(Chapter 252) and the 5th Respondent had given the authority to a commission

appointed under the Commission of Inquiry Act in relation to the inquiry.

Further, the Petitioner had sought a writ of Prohibition preventing the 5th Respondent

from commencing and/or continuing with any inquiry against the Petitioner in terms

of gazette marked as P4.

The Petitioner sought to challenge the said gazette notification bearing No. 2305/12

dated 09.11.2022 [P4] on the basis that it has been promulgated by the 1st Respondent,

the Governor of the North Western Province arbitrarily and illegally, ultra vires the

Page 5 of 12

provisions of the Municipal Council Ordinance (as amended) and that the decisions

contained therein are tainted with malice.

It is seen that the Petitioners said application was taken up before the learned High

Court Judge of Kurunegala for support and having heard the submissions made on

behalf of the Petitioner as well as the 1st-4th Respondents and the 6th Respondent-

Municipal Council of Kurunegala and the 7th Respondent-Municipal Commissioner of

Municipal Council of Kurunegala, the learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala had

refused the Petitioners application for notice and interim relief and had dismissed the

said application of the Petitioner on 29.11.2022.

Being aggrieved by the said Order marked as [A4], the Petitioner invoked the

revisionary jurisdiction of this Court seeking to revise, set aside or vacate the said

Order dated 29.11.2022 by the learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala in writ

application bearing No. HCW 17/2022 and the reliefs sought therein.

The learned Presidents Counsel made submissions in support of the application and

sought an interim order, suspending the operation of the gazette notification marked

P4 until the final determination of this application and also prayed for an interim order

preventing the 5th Respondent from commencing and/or continuing with any inquiry

against the Petitioner and also submitting any report and/or recommendation to the

1st Respondent in respect of the inquiry initiated by the gazette notification marked

P4.

Furthermore, an interim order was sought until the final determination of this

application, preventing the 1st Respondent from acting in terms of Section 277 (1) of

the Municipal Council Ordinance based on any report and/or findings made by the 5th

Respondent.

On behalf of the 1st-4th Respondents, Additional Solicitor General made submissions in

the opposition. Thereafter, the Court reserved its Order in respect of granting interim

orders prayed in terms of prayers (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of the Petition.

Page 6 of 12

The main contention of the Petitioner is that the gazette notification [P4] is ultra

vires, null and void and ex facie illegal. In view of the North Western Provincial Council

Statute No. 01 of 1990, the said gazette notification is void and of no force or avail in

law within the North Western Province in as much the provisions of the Municipal

Council Ordinance referred to therein cannot be invoked by those bound and governed

by the aforementioned statute. Thus, P4 had not been promulgated in terms of the

North Western Provincial Council Statute No. 01 of 1990.

It was submitted on behalf of the Petitioner that consequent to instituting the High

Court proceedings, the Petitioner became aware that the North Western Provincial

Council has enacted the North Western Provincial Statute No. 1 of 1990 which is cited

as 1990 1 (

) which is marked as X with the Petition.

Therefore, it was the contention of the Petitioner that by virtue of the said statute

being enacted and assented by the Governor of the North Western Province, the

provisions of the Municipal Councils Ordinance referred to in the said Gazette

notification marked P4 are rendered inapplicable within the North Western

Province.

It was further submitted by the Petitioner that since the impugned Gazette notification

marked P4 has been promulgated with reference to the Municipal Councils Ordinance

and not with reference to the said statute. Thus, the said Gazette notification is void

ab initio and has no force or avail in law.

Moreover, it was submitted that,

a. A Provincial Council is entitled to make Statutes in respect of subjects and

functions set out in the Provincial Council List of the Ninth Schedule to the

Constitution in terms of Article 154G (1) of the Constitution of the Republic.

b. Once such Statute comes into force, the provisions of existing Law would remain

inoperative within the said Province.

Page 7 of 12

c. Where such Statute has an inconsistency with an existing law, then the said

Statute in its long title has to specify that the said Statute is inconsistent with

a particular existing law.

In this regard, Petitioner has drawn the attention of Court to the decision of the

Supreme Court in the case of In Re Local Authorities Housing Statute No. 2 of 1995

of the Provincial Council, North Central Province [1997] 3 SLR 344. The gravamen

of the said case was whether a Provincial Statute that had provisions inconsistent with

the provisions of an existing law should in its long title state that it was inconsistent

with the said law. The Supreme Court held that Statute should have been described in

its long title as being inconsistent with that law as required by Article 154G (8).

On this premise, it was argued on behalf of the Petitioner that in view of the said

decision of the Supreme Court, it is evident that where a provision of a Provincial

Statute is inconsistent with an existing Law, it should specify such inconsistency in its

long title. Hence, it is axiomatic that where there is no inconsistency there is no

necessity to specify so in the Statutes long title. Thus, the aforementioned Statute is

valid and operative within the Province.

As such, it was submitted on behalf of the Petitioner that where a validly incorporated

Statute is operative within the Province, it is the said Statute that has to be invoked

by the Provincial actors. Thus, the Provincial Minister would be required to act in terms

of the Statute that is promulgated for the province. As the Governor in this instance is

exercising the powers of the Provincial Minister, under the Provincial Councils

(Consequential Provisions) Act No. 12 of 1989, the Governor cannot act outside the

scope of powers of the Provincial Minister.

Accordingly, the relevant Provincial Minister could only have acted under the said

Statute, and therefore, the invocation of the Municipal Councils Ordinance by the

Governor is bad in law and void ab initio.

As such, the position taken by the Petitioner was that in view of the North Western

Provincial Council Statute No. 1 of 1990, the said Gazette notification is void and of

no force or avail in law within the North Western Province, in as much the provisions

Page 8 of 12

of the Municipal Council Ordinance referred to therein cannot be invoked, by those

bound and governed by the aforementioned Statute.

Hence the Petitioner contended that the North Western Provincial Council Statute No.

1 of 1990 overrides the provisions of the Municipal Councils Ordinance and that the

promulgation of any Gazette could only be done in terms of the North Western

Provincial Council Statute No. 1 of 1990.

In this respect, it was submitted on behalf of the 1st 4th Respondents that it is trite

law that a Provincial Council Statute would override dealing with a matter in the

Provincial Council List (including the Municipal Councils Ordinance) only to the extent

that there is any inconsistency between the two. It is noteworthy that this position is

premised on Article 154G of the Constitution.

Article 154G (1) enables every Provincial Council to promulgate provincial Statute and

provides as follows;

Every Provincial Council may, subject to the provisions of the Constitution,

make statutes applicable to the Province for which it is established, with

respect to any matter set out in List I of the Ninth Schedule (hereinafter

referred to as the Provincial Council List).

Court draws the attention to Article 154G (8) of the Constitution;

Where there is a law with respect to any matter on the Provincial Council List

in force on the date on which this Chapter comes into force and a Provincial

Council established for a Province subsequently makes a statute on the same

matter and which is described in its long title as being inconsistent with that

law, then, the provisions of the law shall, with effect from the date on which

that statute receives assent and so long only as that statute is in force, remain

suspended and be inoperative within that Province.

In terms of Article 154G (8), a Provincial Council Statute would override any law in

respect of any matter in the Provincial Council list only where;

Page 9 of 12

i. There is a law in respect of any matter on the Provincial Council List in force,

and,

ii. The Provincial Council subsequently makes a statute on the same matter

which is in turn described in the long title as being inconsistent with the

aforesaid law in force.

Hence, for any Provincial Council Statute to override any law in respect of a matter on

the Provincial Council List, the statute must expressly refer to the inconsistency in its

long title.

On this premise, it is observable that the long title of the North Western Provincial

Council Statute No. 1 of 1990 does not describe the statute as being inconsistent with

the Municipal Councils Ordinance.

Therefore, it was submitted on behalf of the 1st 4th Respondents that the

constitutional pre-requisite provided in Article 154G (8) for the North Western

Provincial Council Statute No. 1 of 1990 to override the provisions of the Municipal

Councils Ordinance is not fulfilled.

It was further submitted that the North Western Provincial Council Statute No. 1 of

1990 does not in any way override and/or negate the provisions of the Municipal

Councils Ordinance.

It is relevant to note that for the law to remain suspended and be inoperative within

the province, the competing Statute of the Provincial Council must describe in its long

title that the said statute is inconsistent with the law.

It is not the function of this Court to compare the statute and the law for the purpose

of ascertaining whether there is any inconsistency between the statute and the law.

Under Article 154G (8), what is required for the law to be inoperative in a Province is

the existence of a description of inconsistency between the Statute and the law.

Page 10 of 12

It clearly manifests from the long title of the Statute [ 1990

01 ( )

] that it does not refer to any inconsistency with the law.

Eg- Municipal Council's Ordinance.

In contradistinction, a similar Statute enacted by the Western Provincial Council

[ 1991 04 (

) ] includes such description to the effect that

the Statute is inconsistent with the law.

The long title of the said Western Provincial Council Statute "Delegation of supervising

authority of Local Authorities Statute No.4 of 1991" [1991 4

( ] stipulates;

. ,

(252 ) XIV 277 ,

(255 ) 08 184 1987

15 185 (inconsistent) .

It is to be observed that the long title of the North Western Province Statute

Delegation of Supervising Authority of Local Authorities Statute No. 04 of 1991, does

not indicate the word (inconsistent).

The long title of the said Statute states that;

.

Page 11 of 12

In this circumstance, it is apparent that the 1st Respondent is fully empowered by law

to issue the Gazette marked P4 under and in terms of Section 277(1A) of the Municipal

Councils Ordinance.

The Petitioner contended that the use of the word offences in the Gazette marked

P4 somehow deprives the said Gazette of any legal validity. However, the Petitioner

has failed to provide any legally valid rationale to substantiate the same.

The said Gazette P4 does not merely refer to offences but refers to the offences in

Section 277(1) of the amended Municipal Councils Ordinance.

It was submitted by the Respondent that since the wording used clearly refers to

Section 277(1) of the Municipal Councils Ordinance, there is no ambiguity or

uncertainty in the scope of the inquiry to be conducted by the retired judicial officer

who was appointed by the said Gazette. It is expressly limited to the provisions of

Section 277(1) of the Municipal Councils Ordinance.

Irrespective of the terminology used, it is obvious that the retired Judicial Officer (the

5th Respondent) is to carry out an inquiry pertaining to the item listed in Section 277

(1) of the Municipal Councils Ordinance.

In other words, in terms of the Gazette, the retired judicial officer will carry out an

inquiry to ascertain whether there was;

a) Incompetence; or

b) Persistent default in the performance of the duties imposed by this Ordinance

or any other written law; or

c) Persistent refusal or neglect to comply with any provisions of law; or

d) Abuse of the powers conferred by this Ordinance or any other Written law; or

e) Persistent refusal to hold or attend any meetings or to vote or to transact

business at any meeting to be held, on the part of the Petitioner.

Moreover, the learned High Court Judge has considered the Sinhala version of the

Gazette and correctly identified that the Sinhala version provides as follows;

Page 12 of 12

277(1)

.

The use of the term "" is not in any way inconsistent with the wording of Section

277(1) of the Municipal Councils Ordinance.

Therefore, it is apparent that the Petitioners position is misconceived, that the

wording used in the Gazette marked P4 does not in any way deprive the same of legal

validity and that the said gazette is not vague. Thus, the said Gazette notification

marked P4 is not ultra vires, illegal or bad in law and has not been issued in

contravention of the due process and principles of natural justice.

Taking into consideration all the facts and law placed before Court on behalf of the

Petitioner and the 1st 4th Respondents, I see no reason to interfere with the Order of

the learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala dated 29.11.2022. Thus, I hold that there

is no legal basis to issue formal notice of this application on the Respondent-

Respondents.

Hence, this application is dismissed with cost.
