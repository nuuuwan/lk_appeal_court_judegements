Judgment

This is an appeal that emanates from the order made by the learned High Court Judge of

Tangalle exercising revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Southern

Province holden in Tangalle seeking to aside the Order of the learned Magistrate made in

terms of Section 68 (3) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 in favour of the

1st Party Respondents and directing the 2nd Party-Respondent to hand over the possession of

the disputed land to the 1st party-Respondents.

It appears that in the revision application the learned High Court judge held against the 1st

Party Respondent-Respondent on the basis that in terms of section 68 (1) of the Primary Court

Procedure Act, the 2nd party Respondent-Petitioner was in possession of the disputed portion

of land on the date of filing of the information and overruled the decision of the learned

Magistrate.

Apparently, the learned High Court Judge had come to the aforesaid conclusion on the basis

that since the information was filed on 23.01.2012 by the officer in charge of the police

station Katuwana pursuant to the complaint made by the 1st Party-Respondent, R. P.

Dayawathi on 27.03. 2011.

Consequent to the said complaint of R.P. Dayawathi, the 2nd Party-Respondent Amarapala

Jayawardene alias Hitchchi Mahaththaya had made a statement to the Katuwana police

station that,

.

.

In this instance, court observes that the said 2nd Party-Respondent, Amarapala Jayawardene

had made a complaint to the police station on 01.12.2011 stating that,

.

, , ,

.

It appears that the Katuwana police had inquired about the said complaint of the 2nd Party-

Respondent Amarapala Jayawardene and consequently had made observation notes on

02.12.2012. Statements were also recorded on 03. 02.2012 from 1st Party-1st Respondent

R.P. Dayawathi, and 1st Party-2nd Respondent A. A. Ajith Kumara.

Therefore, it is imperative to note that the officer in charge of police station Katuwana had

filed information on 23.01.2012, not on the complaint made by said R.P. Dayawathi on 27.

03. 2011, it was filed on the statements made by said R. P. Dayawathi and A.A Ajith Kumara

Page 5 of 6

on 03.12. 2011 consequent to the complaint made by the 2nd party Respondent, Amarapala

Jayawardene.

As such, it clearly shows that the said information was filed on the dispute that arose between

the 1st party, 2nd,3rd,4th Respondents, and the 2nd party Respondent with regard to the blocks

of land claimed by the 1st party Respondents when they made an attempt to demarcate

boundaries of their lots by fencing the respective blocks of land.

Therefore, the learned High Court Judge misdirected himself and had come to an erroneous

conclusion that the impugned information was filed consequent to the complaint made by

the 1st party-1st Respondent the said R.P. Dayawathi on 27.03.2011.

Hence, it clearly manifests that the learned High Court judge erred in law and facts and held

against the 1st Party-Respondents on the assumption that the 2nd party Respondent was in

possession of the disputed blocks of land on the date of filing of the information in terms of

Section 68(1) of the Act. Thus, the order dated 06. 05. 2014 of the learned High Court Judge

stands to be set aside.

In view of the statements made by said R. P. Dayawathi on 03.12.2011, it states that,

2011.12.01

04 . 04

.

Since the 2nd Party-Respondent Amarapala Jayawardene had made the complaint on

01.12.2011 against the 1st Party-Respondent, it clearly demonstrates that the immediate

dispute arose between the 1st Party-Respondents and the 2nd Party-Respondent just before

filing of the information on 01.12.2011. In view of the complaint made by the 2nd party

Respondent and the statements made by the 1st Party-Respondents, it is apparent that the 1st

Party Respondents were dispossessed, or their possession had been disturbed by the 2nd party-

Respondent. Thus, the learned Magistrate had correctly applied the relevant provisions of the

Page 6 of 6

Primary Court Procedure Act and has held that in terms of Section 68(3) of the Act, the 1st

Party-Respondent's position in respect of the disputed land was disturbed or had been

dispossessed by the 2nd Party-Respondent within two months prior to the date of filing of the

information. It is seen that the learned Magistrate acting as the Primary Court Judge had

come to the correct findings of fact and law and decided the matter in favour of the 1st party

Respondent. Thus, we set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge and uphold the

order dated 18.06. 2012 of the learned Magistrate.

Hence, we allow the appeal of the 1st-Party-2nd,3rd, and 4th Respondent-Respondent-

Petitioners [Appellant] and direct the 2nd Party Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent to hand

over the position of the respective disputed portions of land to the 1st Party-1st,2nd,3rd and 4th

Respondent-Petitioner [Appellants].

The costs are fixed at LKR. 25,000 to be paid by the 2nd Party Respondent-Petitioner-

Respondent to the 1st Party-2nd ,3rd ,4th Respondent-Respondent-Petitioners [Appellants].

Appeal allowed.
