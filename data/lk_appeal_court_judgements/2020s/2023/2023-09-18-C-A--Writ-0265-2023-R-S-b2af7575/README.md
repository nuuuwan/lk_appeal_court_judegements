as;

.

,

Facts of the case

3) The Petitioner has contended that she was appointed to the post of

Technology Transfer Officer on 1st December 2011 in the Technology

Transfer Division. In the said Division the Petitioner has worked for over

10 years without any incumbrances. She has discharged her duties with

the utmost good faith and won the good will of her subordinates.

4) The Petitioner had sought a transfer in 2017 to the Genetics and Plant

Breeding Division which had been refused by the Director General of the

Department of Management Services.

5) Subsequently, by letter dated 4th January 2021 the Petitioner was

transferred to a different Division of the 1st Respondent Institute. As the

Petitioner is a Technology Transfer Officer, she cannot be placed as a

Research Officer, even though the recruiting processes are the same, the

duties of the posts are different.

6) Subsequently, the Petitioner had reported for duty on 19th January 2021

at the Crop Protection Division and signed the attendance register in the

Technology Transfer Division. After reporting to work for 2 weeks, the

15th Respondent had disallowed the Petitioner to report to work. The

Petitioner had made complaints to the Human Rights Commission and

filed a Fundamental Rights case.

7) After filing the Fundamental Rights case the Board of Directors of the 1st

Respondent had interdicted the Petitioner without an inquiry. Upon the

Petitioner withdrawing the Fundamental Rights case, the Petitioner was

issued a charge sheet by the 1st Respondent. The Petitioner was not

given the opportunity for a fair and formal inquiry and was convicted for

all charges.

8) On that, the Petitioner has filed this case to invoke the Writ Jurisdiction

of this Court.

6

9) The Limited Objections filed by the 3rd Respondent has denied the facts

stated by the Petitioner and has contended by the Letter of Appointment

R1 that the Petitioners service is transferable.

10) As the Petitioner had sought a transfer in 2017, the Petitioner was

transferred to the Research Division giving an attachment to the said

Division for 3 years.

11) Subsequently, the Petitioner had complained to the Human Rights

Commission and had not reported to assume duties. On that, she had

been interdicted as she had not attended to duties which is evinced by

the attendance record marked as P7.

12) Later, the Petitioner had refused to follow the instructions given by the

superior officers which prompted to issue a charge sheet and to interdict

the Petitioner. Thereafter, an inquiry had been held where initially the

Petitioner had participated and later the Petitioner was absent during the

inquiry proceedings.

13) On that the Petitioner was convicted for the charges on the charge sheet

and the Respondents had contended that this Court has no jurisdiction

to hear and determine this application as the Petitioner had failed to

resort to alternative remedies and had not established her case to get any

reliefs under Writ of Mandamus or Certiorari.

Disputes between the Petitioner and the Respondents to be considered on

the issuance of notice and interim order

14) Considering the facts pertinent to the application made by the Petitioner

and on perusal of the documents and the argument raised by the

Counsel for the Petitioner, Attorney-at-Law P. K. Prince Perera and for

the Respondents, S.S.C. M.Amarasinghe argued the case. To decide the

issuance of notice and interim reliefs, the following disputed facts can be

considered.

7

I. Was the Petitioner employed by the 1st Respondent?

II. Has the 1st Respondent interdicted and terminated the Petitioners

service arbitrarily and/or illegally?

III. If so, can this Court invoke Writ Jurisdiction to grant reliefs sought by

the Petitioner in the petition dated 22nd May 2023?

I. Was the Petitioner employed by the 1st Respondent?

15) On perusal of the documents marked as P3 and P4, the Petitioner had

been employed by the 1st Respondent the Coconut Research Board. That

fact had not been challenged.

16) The Senior State Counsel who appeared for the Respondents had

admitted that the Petitioner was an employee of the 1st Respondent. The

3rd Respondent had confirmed the said fact by filing the Letter of

Appointment marked as R1.

17) In the said circumstances, it is an admitted fact that the Petitioner was

an employee of the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

II. Has the 1st Respondent interdicted and terminated the Petitioners

service arbitrarily and/or illegally?

18) The crux of this case is based on the interdiction and the termination of

the service of the Petitioner. The Counsel appearing for the Petitioner

Attorney-at-Law Prince Perera argued that the Petitioner was interdicted

without any valid reason and thereafter, served a charge sheet and held

a disciplinary inquiry arbitrarily and terminated the service of the

Petitioner.

19) The Senior State Counsel vehemently denied the aforesaid position taken

by the Petitioner and reiterated the position taken by the Respondents by

the Letter of Appointment R1 that the Petitioners service is a

transferable service.

20) The Petitioner had requested by the letter dated 16th January 2017

which is marked as P5 to grant permission for a Divisional Transfer.By

8

letter marked as R2 the said application made by the Petitioner was

allowed. The said fact is supported by document R4 and the annexure to

R4.

21) Subsequently, the Petitioner had been transferred to a separate Division

by letter R6 dated 4th January 2021. The dispute had arisen after the

Petitioner had been transferred to the Division referred to in letter R6.

22) The Counsel for the Petitioner argued that the Petitioner was transferred

to a separate Division which is completely different from the basis on

which she was recruited. However, the Petitioner had reported to work

in the said Division and later she was restrained from reporting to work

by the 15th Respondent.

23) However, the Senior State Counsel denied the said facts and brought the

notice of attendance registers R7 and R8 that the Petitioner had failed to

report to work after she was transferred.

24) Later, by document R10 the Respondents had held a preliminary inquiry

subject to the complaints made by the Petitioner and had decided to

issue a charge sheet against the Petitioner.

25) After serving the charge sheet at the inquiry, initially the Petitioner had

participated and later on the Petitioner had failed to attend the said

inquiry. The proceedings of the inquiry marked as R12 had supported

that position.

26) Based on Inquiry R12 the Petitioners service had been terminated.

Those facts had been supported by the documents R12 to R18. Position

taken by the Counsel for the Petitioner is that the proceedings conducted

at the inquiry and terminating the Petitioners service is arbitrary and

illegal. On that ground the Petitioner has proceeded to invoke the Writ

Jurisdiction of this Court.

27) When the Court questioned from the Counsel for the Petitioner whether

the Petitioner had not sought the alternative reliefs, his answer was

Petitioner could come to the Labour Tribunal or seek Writ Jurisdiction.

9

III. If so, can this Court invoke Writ Jurisdiction to grant reliefs sought

by the Petitioner in the petition dated 22nd May 2023?

28) In the instant application considering the facts, documents and the

arguments raised by the Counsel for the Petitioner, the dispute between

the Petitioner and the Respondents are, interdicting the Petitioner and

terminating the Petitioners service arbitrarily and illegally and the

inquiry conducted by the Respondents had denied a fair and formal

disciplinary inquiry of the Petitioner.

29) In the said circumstances, on the face of it, the Petitioner should have

sought reliefs from the Labour Tribunal as it is a dispute between the

Servant and the Master.

30) The Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 19501 defines what sort of disputes

should be instituted before them. Further, Industrial Dispute is

defined as;

Any dispute or difference between an employer and a

workman or between employers and workmen or between

workmen and workmen connected with the employment or

non-employment, or the terms of employment, or with the

conditions of labour, or the termination of the services, or the

reinstatement in service, of any person, and for the purposes

of this definition workmen includes a trade union consisting

of workmen.

When the statutory power is provided to resolve the nature of

disputes between the Master and the Servant, I do not see that the

Petitioner has any right to invoke the jurisdiction of this court.

31) In Ranaweera V Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka and Another2

Justice Marsoof (P/CA) has decided as follows;

I have come to the conclusion that the Petitioner is not entitled

to the reliefs prayed for by him. The Petitioner has sought a

1 Hereinafter referred to as Industrial Disputes Act. 2 [2004] 2 Sri L.R 346.

10

writ of mandamus with a view of enforcing the order of the

Labour Tribunal as modified by the order of the Provincial

High Court. Mandamus simply does not lie to enforce an order

of the Labour Tribunal or an order made on appeal by the

Provincial High Court... The writ of mandamus would not be

available where there is an effective alternative remedy.

32) In considering the said decision it is clear that the Industrial Disputes

Act has provided an effective procedure to consider the nature of the

dispute arisen in this application. The Petitioner has failed to seek

the reliefs from the Labour Tribunal which is the relevant authority to

decide her grievances as provided by the statue.

CONCLUSION

33) In relation to the aforesaid facts and documents we are of the view that

as the Petitioner has alternative reliefs provided by the statue, the

Petitioner cannot invoke the Writ Jurisdiction of this Court. On that we

dismiss the petition dated 22nd May 2023 subject to the payment of Tax

cost to the Respondents.
