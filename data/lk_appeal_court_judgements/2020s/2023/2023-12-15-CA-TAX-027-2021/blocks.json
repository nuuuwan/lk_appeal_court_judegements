    "text": "15 [The rest of the Note is reproduced here in footnote] Macmillans appointment of Lord Denning to the Court of Appeal, as Master of the Rolls, in April 1962 could be seen in this context as an unorthodox, but inherently conservative, attempt to modernise the institution of the law along similar lines to those which Macmillan adopted with regard to other institutions during the period of his premiership. Lord Dennings appointment came between the Orpington by-election, in the seat next door to that of the Prime Minister, which the Conservatives lost to the Liberals, and the so called night of the long knives on 13th July 1962 when Macmillan sacked seven Cabinet ministers, including the Lord Chancellor. It was a time of decided instability in the fortunes of the Conservative government. In this context, Macmillans appointment of Lord Denning to conduct the inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the resignation of John Profumo in June 1963 should be considered an astute manouevre; the deployment of a conservative, but unorthodox, judge of Lord Dennings calibre was perhaps the only way in which the gravest crisis of his premiership could have been resolved satisfactorily. In the febrile atmosphere of the summer of 1963, a judge of the stamp of Lord Simonds would not have been able to construct a report which would been credible, let alone have saved the government. Lord Denning did not disappoint; his Report saved Macmillan, perhaps even the Establishment itself. Despite his modest criticism of his conduct as Prime Minster during the affair, Lord Denning retained a substantial amount of respect for Harold Macmillan. He concluded his account of the whole business in Landmarks in the Law by",

    "text": "18 This case is about a complaint made by Dr. Frederick Guilder Julius against the Rev. Thomas Thellusson Carter, rector of the parish, in respect of unauthorized deviations from the ritual of the Church in the Communion Service, and the use of unauthorized vestments. Dr. Julius preferred a complaint to the Bishop of Oxford and required the Bishop to issue a commission under the Church Discipline Act third and 4th Victoria chapter 86, to inquire into this charge. The Bishop, in the exercise of his discretion, declined to issue this commission. The Court of Queens Bench directed a writ of mandamus to issue commanding the Bishop either to issue the commission which Dr. Julius had applied for or to send the case by letters of request to the Court of Appeal of the province under the Statute. The Court of Appeal reversed this decision1. The House of Lords heard this case on Tuesday 23rd March 1880 and had to decide whether or not the Court of Queens Bench was right in awarding this mandamus1. Lord Chancellor Cairns observed that the words it shall be lawful in section 3 of the Church Discipline Act conferred a faculty or power, and they did not of themselves do more than confer a faculty or power2.",
