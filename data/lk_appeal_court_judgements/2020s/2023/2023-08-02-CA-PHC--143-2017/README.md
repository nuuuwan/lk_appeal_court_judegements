The claimant-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant)

preferred this appeal being aggrieved by the order dated 24th August 2017,

where the revision application filed by him before the High Court of the

Western Province holden in Awissawella was dismissed by the learned High

Court Judge of Awissawella by the impugned order.

The appellant is the registered owner of the vehicle bearing No- SG LD 0856.

The said vehicle had been detained by the officers of Eheliyagoda police for

allegedly transporting Jak and Nadun timber without a valid permit, which is

an offence punishable in terms of the Forest Ordinance.

Accordingly, the driver of the vehicle had been charged before the Magistrate

Court of Awissawella and he had pleaded guilty to the charge on 25-02-2015.

He had been fined Rs. 20000/- with a default sentence of two months simple

imprisonment, and the illegally transported timber had been confiscated.

The learned Magistrate of Awissawella, apparently, acting in terms of section

40 of the Forest Ordinance as amended by Forest (Amendment) Act No-65 of

2009, had ordered the owner of the vehicle to show cause as to why the vehicle

involved in the offence should not be confiscated.

At the ensuring inquiry, the appellant who is the registered owner of the vehicle

has given evidence claiming the vehicle, and the driver of the vehicle, who was

the accused in the case, has also given evidence on behalf of the registered

owner.

The appellant in his evidence has taken up the position that he used the

vehicle for the purposes of his timber mill, but used to give the vehicle on hire

on other occasions. He has employed the accused as his driver and had given

specific instructions to him not to engage in illegal activities like transporting

timber or sand without a valid permit. It had been his evidence that he used to

be vigilant as to the activities of the driver, but on the day in question, he was

Page 5 of 15

informed that the driver had been arrested for transporting timber without a

permit. He had urged for the release of the vehicle on the basis that he took all

the necessary precautions to prevent the offence and he had no knowledge of

the offence been committed.

The driver of the vehicle in his evidence has stated that he had instructions

form the owner of the vehicle not to engage in illegal activities like transporting

of sand and it was he who accepted hires from others and earn money on

behalf of the owner. He has explained the arrangement they had to share the

earnings. He has claimed that on the day in question, while he was in

Thalavitiya area expecting hires, he was engaged by a person to transport

timber to a timber mill in Eheliyagoda. He has stated that he was arrested by

the police in that process, and his employer discontinued his service after the

incident.

The position of the prosecution had been that both the registered owner of the

vehicle and the driver knew very well each others actions and the timber was

transported to the mill owned by the appellant on his instructions. The

prosecution had moved for the confiscation of the vehicle in terms of the Forest

Ordinance.

The appellant has preferred an application in revision to the High Court of the

Western Province holden in Awissawella, challenging the order of confiscation

by the learned Magistrate of Awissawella.

The main contention of the appellant in his revision application before the High

Court had been that although the accused of the Magistrate Court action had

pleaded guilty to the purported charge against him, there was no valid charge

before the Court and there was no basis to confiscate the vehicle.

In addition, the appellant has claimed that the learned Magistrate failed to

appreciate the evidence led at the inquiry in its correct perspective, and was

misdirected in analyzing the evidence.

Page 6 of 15

After hearing the parties, and giving an opportunity to file written submissions

as to their respective stands, the learned High Court Judge of Awissawella by

his order dated 24th august 2017 has dismissed the application of revision.

It had been determined that the appellant has no basis to contend that there

was no valid charge against the accused in the Magistrate Court case, since the

accused has pleaded guilty to the charge preferred against him, and he is not

entitled to raise an objection to the charge at the stage of the inquiry held in

terms of section 40 of the Forest Ordinance.

The learned High Court Judge has relied on the decided Court of Appeal case of

H.G.Sujith Priyantha Vs. The Attorney General CA (PHC) 157/12 decided

on 19-12-2015, where it was held that a claimant of a vehicle in terms of the

proviso of section 40 of the Forest Ordinance cannot raise the defects of the

charge preferred against the accused, once the accused in the case pleads

guilty to the charge against him, preferred under section 40 of the Act.

The leaned High Court Judge has decided not to consider the Court of Appeal

decision cited by the appellant at the inquiry, namely, the judgment in the case

of Abubackerge Jaleel Vs. The Attorney General CA(PHC) 108/2010

decided on 26-08-2014, on the basis that it relates to a situation where there

was no charge before the Magistrate when the accused in the case was found

guilty, which was not the case in relation to the revision application before the

High Court.

After considering the evidence placed before the Court by the appellant at the

inquiry, the learned High Court Judge has decided that the appellant has failed

to establish that he took all the necessary precautions to prevent the offence

being committed, and he has no basis to interfere with the order of the learned

Magistrate of Awissawella.

Page 7 of 15

At the hearing of this appeal, one of the main grounds of appeal urged by the

learned Counsel for the appellant was that there was no valid charge before the

Magistrate Court for the accused to be found guilty, even on his own plea, and

therefore, there was no basis for the learned Magistrate to call for the owner of

the vehicle to show cause as to why the vehicle belonging to him should not be

confiscated.

Apart from the above legal contention, it was the position of the learned

Counsel that the appellant had adduced sufficient evidence before the Court to

justify his claim, but the learned magistrate as well as the learned High Court

Judge failed to appreciate the evidence in its correct perspective.

It was the position of the learned State Counsel that the evidence placed before

the Court by the appellant at the inquiry held in terms of section 40 of the

Forest Ordinance was wholly inadequate to come to a finding that the appellant

had taken all the necessary precautions to prevent the offence being committed

and that he was unaware of the offence committed by the driver of the vehicle.

The learned State Counsel cited the discrepancies in the evidence adduced by

the appellant and his driver to substantiate his claim to the vehicle, and moved

for the dismissal of the application on the basis that it has no merit.

As this appeal involves questions of law as well as questions of facts, I will now

proceed to consider the question of law raised by the learned Counsel for the

appellant in relation to the facts of the matter under consideration.

The position taken on behalf of the appellant was that there was no valid

charge before the Magistrate Court and hence, there was no basis to attract the

provisions of Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance in relation to the vehicle,

which was the subject matter of the inquiry.

For the better understanding of the above position, I would now procced to

consider the Court of Appeal Judgments relied on by the learned High Court

Judge in more detail.

Page 8 of 15

In the judgment of H. G. Sujith Priyantha Vs. The Attorney General CA

(PHC) 157/12 decided on 19-12-2015, the learned Magistrate of Galle, after

an inquiry held in terms of section 40 of the Forest Ordinance, held that the

claimant of the vehicle failed to show sufficient cause as to why the vehicle

involved in the crime should be released to him, and confiscated the vehicle in

terms of the Ordinance. At the consideration of the revision application filed

before the relevant High Court challenging the order of the learned Magistrate,

an objection was raised, apparently based on a technicality of the charge

preferred against the accused of the Magistrate Court case on the basis that

that there was no valid charge before the Magistrate Court against the accused

and hence, no basis to hold an inquiry as to the vehicle involved.

It was held:

The accused in the Magistrate Court case was convicted on their own plea

under section 38(a) and 40(a) read with section 25(2)(b) of the Forest

Ordinance as amended, for transporting timber in the relevant vehicle

without a valid permit. After facing an inquiry in terms of the proviso of

section 40 of the Forest ordinance, the owner of the vehicle cannot now

challenge the conviction of the accused based on a defect of the charge

preferred against them at the appeal.

It is clear from the reasoning of the judgment that the rationally behind was

that the owner of the vehicle who claimed the vehicle before the Court, or the

accused, were not misled as to the charge against them as the relevant sections

under which the accused were charged were known to them when the inquiry

was held in terms of the proviso of section 40 of the Forest Ordinance,

although there may have been technical defects in the charge.

Page 9 of 15

The facts under which the Court of Appeal decided the case of Abubackerge

Jaleel Vs. The Attorney General CA(PHC) 108/2010 decided on 26-08-

2014 were very much different to the facts of the matter considered earlier.

The police filed a report under section 136(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act informing the Court that the accused had committed the

offences of causing cruelty to animals and transporting them without a permit,

which are offences in terms of the Cruelty to the Animals Act and Animals Act

respectively.

The Animals Act has similar provisions where a vehicle involved in a

transportation of the Animals without a permit can be confiscated.

It was found at the hearing of the appeal against the confiscation of the vehicle,

which transported the animals, that although the learned Magistrate had

recorded a plea of guilty from the accused, there was no charge framed against

them, but only a seal in the case record that the accused was found guilty on

his plea.

A.W.A.Salam, J. (P/CA), after considering several judicial decisions on the

necessity of framing a charge by a Magistrate, held;

Thus, it would be seen that farming of a charge to give validity to a

criminal prosecution or subsequent conviction is absolutely indispensable.

The absence of a charge is fatal to the validity of the trial and the

conviction as well. This principle has been exhaustively discussed in

Abdul Sameem Vs. The Bribery Commissioner (1991) 1 SLR 76 in

reference to a long line of decided authorities including a full bench

decision.

Page 10 of 15

Held Further;

An order of confiscation is in fact a punishment which is imposed in

addition to the ordinary punishment imposed on the offender. However, if

the vehicle used in the commission of the offence belongs to a third party,

it is confiscated only after the third party is afforded an opportunity of

being heard.

The confiscation of the vehicle has to be based on a conviction which is

acceptable in law. If there is no conviction, then there is no confiscation. In

other words, a valid conviction is a condition precedent to proceed to call

upon the owner of the vehicle, if he is not the offender, to explain himself.

With the above judicial decisions in mind, I will now focus my attention to the

purported charge preferred against the accused in the appeal under

consideration.

The charge dated 25-02-2015, filed of record in the Magistrate Court case

reads as follows;

,

It is clear from the above charge that the accused had been informed that he

would be charged for an offence punishable in terms regulation 25 read with

regulation 9(1) of the Forest Regulations promulgated by the subject Minister

under the powers vested in him in terms of the Forest Ordinance as amended,

and published in the Extraordinary Government Gazette No-68/14 dated 26-

12-1979 and No-429/08 dated 26-11-1986.

It is therefore clear that when the accused was charged before the Magistrate

Court for the alleged offence committed by him, he had been informed that he

would be punished under the terms of the Forest regulations mentioned in the

charge.

He has not been informed of any punishable section under the Forest

Ordinance, which attracts the provisions of section 40 of the Forest Ordinance,

if found guilty.

The relevant section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance as amended by Forest

(Amendment) Act No-65 of 2009 reads as follows;

40. (1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence-

(a) All timber or forest produce which is not the property of

the state in respect of which such offence has been

committed; and

(b) All tools, vehicles, implements, cattle, and machine used in

committing such offence,

Page 12 of 15

shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such offence,

be confiscated by order of the convicting Magistrate.

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicle,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence,

is a third party, no order of confiscation shall made if such owner

proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements,

cattle and machines, as the case may be, for the commission of the

offence.

Interestingly, leave aside the fact that the relevant punishable section or

sections in terms of the Forest Ordinance have not been mentioned in the

charge, the mentioned regulation 9(1) and the regulation 25 of the Forest

Regulation No 02 of 1979 refers to the conditions of the permits issued to a

party to transport timber.

The Regulation 09(1) reads thus;

9(1). Where any permit issued for the transport of private timber

from any area has expired before such timber has been so

transported, the transport of such timber shall not be commenced

or continued until the owner or other person time being in charge of

the timber has obtained an extension of the time allowed for the

permit.

The Regulation 25 reads thus;

25. Every permit issued under the preceding of these regulations

shall be subject to such conditions as may be specified in such

permit and any infringement of any such conditions shall be deemed

to be an offence punishable under section 25 of the Ordinance.

Page 13 of 15

This goes on to show that the two regulations mentioned in the charge are

regulations that govern situations once a permit to transport timber has been

issued and violation of the conditions attached to such a permit.

It is, therefore, amply clear that the purported charge upon which the accused

of the case was found guilty was a charge without mentioning any of the penal

provisions of the Forest Ordinance, which attract the provisions of section 40 of

the Forest Ordinance, upon which a vehicle involved with the crime can be

confiscated.

Under the circumstances, I am unable to find under what provisions of the law

the learned Magistrate proceeded to convict the accused and impose a fine on

him, and decided to hold an inquiry in relation to the vehicle, which was

confiscated.

There is no doubt that the Magistrate Courts are inundated with work, and

under normal conditions, it is the prosecution who tender the draft charge.

However, since it is the paramount duty of a Magistrate to frame the charge

against an accused, it is the duty of the Magistrate to make sure that a proper

charge with the necessary ingredients of a charge is in place before recording a

plea from an accused person.

It is the view of this Court that convicting a person under an imaginary penal

provision, although there is a purported charge before the Court, amounts to

convicting without a charge, and the owner of the vehicle whose vehicle that

would be subjected to confiscation as a result of such a conviction is entitled to

take up an objection in that regard, even at the appeal stage, as it is a matter

that involves his property rights.

Salam, J. (P/CA) in the earlier considered case of CA (PHC) 108/2010 after

considering whether the claimant of a vehicle has any locus standi to challenge

the conviction when the accused has not elected to challenge the same

observed;

Page 14 of 15

It has to bone in mind that an order of confiscation of property whether

movable or immovable leads to deprivation of property rights of a citizen.

Inasmuch as the Court has to approach the issue relating to the liberty of

the subject by giving a strict interpretation of the provisions of the law and

the same approach has to be aimed at resolving the issues relating to the

legality of the confiscation orders as well, since the confiscatory provisions

in any enactment though it may not be strictly called a draconian measure,

yet it has such a draconian flavour.

Therefore, it is my considered view that the learned High Court Judge was

misdirected as to the relevant principles of law when he decided not to follow

the stare decisis of the case CA(PHC) 108/2010, and to follow the case of

CA(PHC) 157/12.

I am of the view that the facts relevant to the case under appeal is not a

situation where there was a proper charge, but with some technical defects,

which has not caused any prejudice to the accused as well as the owner of the

vehicle, as contemplated in the case considered by the learned High Court

Judge to dismiss the application before him.

It is my view that there was no valid conviction of the accused under the

provisions of the Forest Ordinance, and therefore, there was no basis for the

owner to be called upon to show cause against a possible confiscation, which

was an order based on illegality. I am of the view that consideration of the

evidence adduced at the inquiry was not necessary for the learned High Court

Judge, if the above legal requirement was considered in its correct perspective.

For the reasons considered above, I am of the view that there were sufficient

exceptional grounds before the learned High Court Judge warranting the

invoking of the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court to set aside the order

of confiscation of the vehicle owned by the appellant.

Page 15 of 15

Accordingly, I set aside the order dated 04-11-2015 by the learned Magistrate

of Awissawella where the vehicle No-SG LD 0856 owned by the appellant was

ordered to be confiscated, and the order dated 24-08-2017 of the learned High

Court Judge of Awissawella, as both the orders cannot be allowed to stand.

It is ordered that the relevant vehicle shall be released to the appellant.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the

relevant High Court as well as the relevant Magistrate Court for necessary

action.
