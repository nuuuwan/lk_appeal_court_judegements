ORDER

P.Kumararatnam,J.

The Petitioner had applied for bail on behalf of the suspect in the High

Court of Galle in the case bearing No. BA 203/2021. After an inquiry,

the Learned High Court Judge had refused bail on 29.03.2022.

Aggrieved by the said order, the Petitioner had filed this Revision

Application to revise the said order. The Petitioner is the mother of the

suspect.

On 18.04.2021, upon receiving an information, the suspect was

arrested by officers attached to Galle Police Station and recovered a

parcel from his sarong knot. The parcel contained some substances

which reacted for Heroin (Diacetylmorphine). The substance weighed

about 126.405 grams. The police also taken into their custody a vehicle

bearing No. SP CBK 6017 and cash Rs.38000/- from the custody of the

Suspect.

The Suspect was produced and facts were reported to the Galle

Magistrate under Section 54A (1) (d) and (b) and of the Poisons, Opium

and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984.

The production had been sent to the Government Analyst Department

on 22/04/2021. After analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded

the report to Galle Magistrate Court on 04/10/2021. According to the

Government Analyst, 10.72 grams of pure Heroin (Diacetylmorphine)

had been detected from the substance sent for the analysis. Although

the police had noted the weight as 126.405 grams, according to the

Government Analyst the substance weighed about 129.20 grams in

excess about 3 grams.

According to the Petitioner, the Suspect had engaged in land and

vehicle brokering in addition to running a small boutique at his

residence. The suspect is a married person and blessed with a child. He

is the sole breadwinner of the family and spends money for his younger

brothers studies.

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in

support of her Revision Application.

1. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider that the

Suspect had been incarcerated since 19.04.2021.

2. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider that it

would take a long time to serve an indictment.

3. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider that the

version of the 1st Respondent-Respondent is highly improbable.

4. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to give due

consideration that the prosecution will face a frontal attack in

respect of the major discrepancy between the weight of the

substance recovered by the police officers and the weight received

by the Government Analyst.

5. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to evaluate the version

of the Suspect in the impugned order.

6. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider that

detaining a suspect without any legal action for an extended

period of time amounts to a violation of his fundamental rights

which can be considered as an exceptional ground.

One of the preliminary objections taken up by the State is that the

Petitioner has failed to explain the delay of four months invoking the

revisionary jurisdiction before this Court. Hence, the State pleads that

this matter should be dismissed in limine as no valid reason had been

explained by the Petitioner for his delay.

CA PHC APN 63-2022

5 | P a g e

The Learned State Counsel submitted that the delay is not an

exceptional circumstance to be considered to enlarge the suspect on

bail. Further, the time spent for preparing the indictment does not

constitute an exceptional circumstance. According to the State, all

steps has been taken to send out indictment against the Suspect under

AG reference No.CR3/389/2022 within reasonable period of time.

The suspect is in remand for little more than more than two years.

According to Government Analyst Report the pure quantity of Heroin

detected is 10.72 grams.

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what

is exceptional circumstances must be considered on its own facts and

circumstances on a case by case.

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

In CA(PHC)APN 107/2018 decided on 19.03.2019 the court held that

remanding for a period of one year and five months without being

served with the in indictment was considered inter alia in releasing the

suspect on bail. According to the Petitioner, at present her family is

going through untold hardship without proper income and care.

The Section 83 of the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act

which was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states:

83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under

sections 54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail

by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 84 and 85, a person

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A

and section 54B-

(a) of which the pure quantity of the dangerous drug, trafficked,

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A;

and

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment, shall not

be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in exceptional

circumstances.

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in

exceptional circumstances.

In this case the pure quantity of Heroin detected in the production by

the Government Analyst is 10.72 grams. Hence, this court has

jurisdiction to consider granting of bail as per the new amendment.

According to the Learned High Court Judge, the sole reason for

rejection of bail to the suspect is non submission of exceptional

circumstances by the Petitioner.

The Counsel for the Petitioner urged this Court to consider that

detaining a suspect without any legal action for an extended period of

time amounts to a violation of his fundamental rights which can be

considered as an exceptional ground.

CA PHC APN 63-2022

In Nasher v. Director of Public Prosecution [2020] VSCA 144 the

court held that:

a combination of delay, onerous custodial conditions, and the

relative weakness of the prosecution case may, when considered

with all relevant circumstances, compel the conclusion that

exceptional circumstances have been established. [Emphasis added]

Upon perusal of the Government Analyst Report, the production had

been received by them on 22.04.2021 and the analyst report was

received by the Magistrate Court, Galle on 04.10. 2021.Although nearly

19 months passed after receiving the Government Analyst Report,

which is one of the deciding factors in a case of this nature, the

prosecution is unable to forward indictment to the High Court to date.

This is a very serious laps on the part of the prosecution.

The right to trial without undue delay is found in numerous

international and regional human rights instruments; for example, the

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 14(3)(c), the

American Convention on Human Rights (Article 8(1), the African

Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (Article 7(1)(d), and the

European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and

Fundamental Freedoms (Article 6(1).

When a person is kept in remand without filing charges for a

considerable period of time, he or she should be released on bail

pending indictment. Otherwise, this will lead to prison overcrowding.

Hence, I consider the delay more than two years in remand falls into the

category of excessive and oppressive delay considering the

circumstances of this case. Considering other matters which had

escaped the attention of the Learned High Court Judge of Galle, the

suspect has very good exceptional circumstances to consider this

CA PHC APN 63-2022

application in his favour. Further, remanding a suspect without filing

any charge will prejudice his rights and his family as well.

Offences under Section 54A(b) and 54A(c) of the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is no

doubt serious offences but seriousness of the offence alone cannot form

a ground to refuse bail. In considering these matters, the court must

bear in mind the presumption of innocence.

Further, bail should never be withheld as punishment. Granting of bail

is primarily at the discretion of the Courts. The discretion should be

exercised with due care and caution taking into account the facts and

circumstances of each case.

Considering all these factors into account, especially the pure quantity

of Heroin detected and the circumstances of the case, I consider this an

appropriate case to grant bail to the suspect. Hence, I order the suspect

be granted bail with following strict conditions.

1. Cash bail of Rs.100,000/=.

2. To provide 02 sureties. They must sign a bond of two million

each.

3. The suspect and the sureties must reside in the address given

until conclusion of his case.

4. Not to approach any prosecution witnesses directly or indirectly

or to interfere with.

5. To surrender his passport if any, to court and not to apply for a

travel document. The Controller of the Immigration and

Emigration is informed of the travel ban on the suspect.

6. To report to the Galle Police Station on the last Sunday of every

month between 9am to 1pm.

7. Any breach of these conditions is likely to result in the

cancellation of his bail.
