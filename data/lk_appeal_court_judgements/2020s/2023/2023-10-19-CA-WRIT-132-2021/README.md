1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents - 11.05.2023

Decided on: 18.10.2023

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioners state that the instant Application has been made for and on behalf of the

Senior Deputy Commissioners (SDC) of the Inland Revenue Department (IR Department),

out of which 276 are members of the 1st Petitioner Union. The main contention of the

Petitioners is that the officers of the IR Department who are promoted to Grade I of the Inland

Revenue Service or to the post of SDC are entitled to official vehicles, including the

entitlement of using such vehicles for private traveling or in lieu of such, a traveling allowance.

The Petitioners are making this claim in terms of the Public Administration Circular No.

22/99 dated 08.10.1999 marked 'P4', as amended by the Public Administration Circular No.

22/99 (XXX) dated 17.11.2014 marked 'P6'.

For a public officer to be entitled to such an official vehicle, it is the Petitioners contention

that he must meet the criteria outlined in 'P6', which in the view of the Petitioners, consist of

the following three specific conditions:

i) The officer must be in Grade I of an All Island Service or a Departmental Service,

ii) The Officer must be appointed on a permanent basis to a post approved by the

General Treasury, and

iii) The officer must be on the salary scale of SL 1-2006 as per Public Administration

Circular 06/2006.

Page 4 of 9

The Petitioners assert that the SDC are Grade 1 officers in the Sri Lanka Inland Revenue

Service and their post which is entitled to the salary scale of SL 1-2006 is permanent as

approved by the General Treasury. As such, the Petitioners claim that they have satisfied the

above three conditions for them to be entitled to an official vehicle or other facilities under

'P6'.

The said circular 'P6' provides for official transport facilities to Public Officers; Provincial

Public Officers; Judicial Officers. At this stage, it is important to conduct an in-depth analysis

of 'P6' in order to ascertain the specific requirements for the Petitioners to be entitled to an

official vehicle or other privileges set down in the said Circular. The provisions most relevant

to the issues of this case are Clause 2. 1:1:1 (XXXI) or 2:2:1 (XXI) [which are identical] of the

said P6.

1:1:1 (XXXI) Officers in Class I of an All Island Service or a Departmental Service

appointed on a permanent basis to a post approved by the General Treasury as a

permanent post in Class I of an All Island Service or a Departmental Service which is

entitled to the salary scale SL 1-2006 as per the provisions of the Public Administration

Circular 06/2006.

2:2:1 (XXI) Officers in Class I of an All Island Service or a Departmental Service

appointed on a permanent basis to a post approved by the General Treasury as a

permanent post in Class I of an All Island Service or a Departmental Service which is

entitled to the salary scale SL 1-2006 as per the provisions of the Public Administration

Circular 06/2006.

The above paragraph 1:1:1 (XXXI) in the copy of the said Circular published in Sinhala

language provides more clarity. It reads:

1:1:1 (XXXI) 06/2006 SL 1-2006

, I

I

Page 5 of 9

On a careful perusal of the relevant provisions, I take the view that, in slight contrast to the

Petitioners' stand in this regard, the following requirements must be satisfied for entitlement

of the benefits under 'P6'.

a) The public officer's salary scale should be SL 1-2006 as per the provisions of the

Public Administration Circular No. 06/2006.

b) The public officer should be in Class I of an All Island Service or a

Departmental Service

c) The officer's post should be a permanent post in Class I of an All Island Service

or a Departmental Service, approved by the General Treasury

d) The public officer should have been appointed on a permanent basis to such

post

I am convinced as per the material submitted to this Court that the Petitioners fall within the

criteria mentioned in the above paragraphs a), b) and c). The question that arises in the instant

Application is, whether the Petitioners have been appointed to a permanent post on a

permanent basis without any hindrance or subject to any conditions, as intimated in the above

paragraph d). This arises based on the submissions made on behalf of the Respondents that

the post of SDC is an official designation given merely to the seniority. The contention of the

Respondents is that the post of SDC is the designation of officers in Grade I who were

promoted from Grade II to Grade I, but not assigned the post in Grade I of the Sri Lanka

Inland Revenue Service. This submission revolves around the Service Minute of the Sri Lanka

Inland Revenue Service published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1804/50 (dated

05.04.2013) marked 'P12'.

Now I must draw my attention to the background to such Service Minutes. The Service

Minute 'P12' are published by the Public Service Commission ('PSC') which has been

constituted under Article 54 (1) of the Constitution1. In terms of Article 55(1), the Cabinet of

Ministers shall provide for and determine all matters of policy relating to public officers,

including policy relating to appointments, promotions, transfers, disciplinary control and

dismissal. The appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of public

1 1978 Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka

Page 6 of 9

officers is vested in the PSC by virtue of Article 55(3), subject to the provisions of the

Constitution. Accordingly, the powers of the PSC are well entrenched in the Constitution.

The PSC, in view of Article 61B, has the power to formulate rules, regulations and procedures

relating to the public service. Under such powers, the PSC, among other matters, deals2 with

the formulation and publication of procedural rules, issuance of circulars and general

instructions relating to the public service as well as the setting up of Service Minutes and

Schemes of Recruitment. At the inception of the PSC, there were no Service Minutes in

respect of several services of the Government. However, it is noted that the PSC currently has

taken steps to implement a Service Minute for almost each approved service in the public

service and a Scheme of Recruitment for several posts in semi-government institutions.

The usual practice, as I am aware, is that the PSC when drafting a Service Minute or Scheme

of Recruitment uses its discretion to approve, reject or approve subject to conditions the

requirements forwarded by a Secretary to a Ministry in relation to appointments, promotions

etc,. The purpose of a Service Minute and a Scheme of Recruitment, as I can understand, is

to uphold fairness, transparency and consistency when making appointments and promotions

to the posts in public service and other related services. In my opinion, the PSC's obligation

with regard to Service Minutes and Schemes of Recruitment is to formulate criteria in line

with the concepts of the Rule of Law in response to any requests for appointments,

promotions, etc, made by the Secretaries of the relevant Ministries and other designated

authorities based on the public administration's policies. The general perception is that the

PSC when exercising such powers collaborates with the Ministry of Public Administration,

National Pay Commission and the Department of Management Services. In this regard, the

Public Administration Circulars also play a vital role. As such, the Service Minutes which is

material to this case are legal instruments formulated by the PSC under its powers flowing

from the Constitution.

The crux of the argument relied on by the Respondents is that the Public Administration

Circulars cannot override the Service Minutes approved by the PSC. The Respondents prime

2 See <https://www.psc.gov.lk/index.php?lang=en>

Page 7 of 9

argument emanates from the Note attached to Clause 12(1) of the Service Minute marked

'P12' which deals with the appointment to the post of SDC. The said Note reads:

The post of Senior Deputy Commissioner is the designation of officers in Grade I who were

promoted from Grade II to Grade I, but not being assigned the post in Grade I of the Sri Lanka

Inland Revenue Service. This post is an official designation given merely to the seniority and not

having any change in the role, responsibility or benefits relating to the post

In view of the said Clause 12(1), the qualifications required for the post of Commissioner and

SDC are equivalent and such qualifications are: to be an officer in Grade I of the Sri Lanka Inland

Revenue Service. The qualifications for the post of Deputy Commissioner are: to be an officer

in Grade II of the Sri Lanka Inland Revenue Service. Thus, it appears the SDC is a post that falls

between the post of Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner, two posts each of which

requires distinct qualifications. This position is further reinforced in line with the contents of

the above Note attached thereto. It can be assumed that the intention of the PSC or the

Secretary to the relevant Ministry is merely to promote the Deputy Commissioners in Grade

II of the Sri Lanka Inland Revenue Service to its Grade I, without assigning the post of

Commissioner (in Grade I). On the other hand, the said promotion is only a Grade-to-Grade

promotion and not a Post-to-Post promotion. Thus, the concern that emanates from the fact

of promoting a Deputy Commissioner to the post of SDC is whether such appointments are

in a conditional nature rather than being made unconditionally as in other usual promotions.

I am aware that during the recent past, the PSC has given approval for such promotions

without assigning the post related to the respective Grade. The reason for this may be to confer

benefits to certain categories of officers who serve in one particular Grade for a long period

without being promoted to the next substantive post. I consider this concept or policy as a

method of facilitating such stagnated officers by granting them the salary of the higher post

but without assigning other benefits associated with such substantive higher posts. In the

meantime, the scenario in the instant Application can be viewed as a better privilege since the

SDC was given a designation that raises their status in addition to the higher salary scale.

Upon an independent study I have done on the aforesaid policy, I have come across several

instances where the Government has adopted the above policy in order to cater to officers

Page 8 of 9

who are stagnating at the maximum point of their salary scales. Accordingly, certain

categories of employees of the public service have been granted salary increments for

stagnating at the maximum point of their salary scale as of a specific date. Mostly such

arrangements were made after issuing the Public Administration Circular No. 06/2006 and

its amendments on restructuring of public service salaries based on budget proposals presented

to Parliament in the year 2006. In fact, this Court inquired from the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner and the learned State Counsel on these points of view at the hearing stage of this

case.

Having observed the above legal surroundings in respect of the Service Minutes, I take the

view that the Service Minute marked P12 approved by the PSC is specific on the point where

the post of Senior Deputy Commissioner (SDC) is only a designation assigned to the officers

in Grade I of the Sri Lanka Inland Revenue Service who are promoted from Grade II to

Grade I. In a nutshell, the Petitioners lack the privilege to meet the criteria described in the

above paragraph d) of the requirements outlined by me earlier in this Judgement, for them to

claim benefits under 'P6'.

Therefore, I am not inclined anyway to express that the Note attached to Clause 12(1) of P12

is irrational. In this backdrop, I hold that the appointment to the post of SDC cannot be

regarded as an appointment on a permanent basis comparable to those specified in Clause

2.1:1:1 (XXXI) and 2:2:1 (XXI) of the P6 since such appointments are clogged by a

legitimate restriction preventing them from claiming benefits assigned to the post of

Commissioner. I do not intend to engage in an exercise here whether the Service Minute (such

as P12) approved by the PSC supersede the Public Administration Circulars (such as P6).

But my task is to give an effective interpretation to the Note attached to Clause 12(1) of P12

based on all the above circumstances. Due to the restrictions laid down in the Note attached

to Clause 12(1) of P12 the Petitioners will not be entitled to the benefits relating either to the

post of SDC or Commissioner.

Furthermore, by promoting the Deputy Commissioners to Grade I from Grade II of the

relevant service, their role as a Deputy Commissioner will not be changed. This is further

established in Clause 21.6 of P12 which states: Duties performed or scheduled to be performed

by the Senior Assessors, as per the provisions of the statutes, any other regulations and circular incidental

Page 9 of 9

thereto, which are coming under or to be brought under the administration of the Commissioner General

of Inland Revenue, will be performed by Senior Deputy Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners

mentioned in this Minute.

For the reasons said forth above, I take the view that there are no valid grounds for me to hold

the impugned letter marked P11 ultra vires/capricious/irrational/unreasonable as claimed

by the Petitioners. The Director General of Establishments, who is the author of the said

P11, has lawfully expressed his observations based on the Note attached to Clause 12(1) of

the said Service Minute marked P12.

The Respondents have taken up several objections on maintainability of the instant

Application. Not having necessary parties before Court, futility and lashes are some of those

objections. The Respondents argue that the Petitioners cannot invoke the writ jurisdiction of

this Court in an indirect manner to challenge the Service Minutes approved by the PSC and

such assertions are made on the doctrine of colourability. In view of my above findings and

based on the circumstances of this case, there is no necessity for me to make an additional

effort to analyze the Respondents objections which were sought to be addressed at the initial

stages.

Hence, I hold that the Petitioners are not entitled to any of the reliefs prayed for in the prayer

of the Petition. I proceed to dismiss the Application without costs.
