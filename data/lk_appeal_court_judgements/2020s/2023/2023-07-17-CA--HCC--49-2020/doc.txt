The Accused-Appellant abovenamed (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was

indicted before the High Court of Gampaha for having committed the offence of murder of

one Kongasdeniyage Ajith Kumara Sampath an offence made punishable under Section 296

of the Penal Code.

Page 3 of 13

Prosecution led the evidence of five witnesses and evidence marked as P1 to P14. The

accused made a dock statement. After the trial, the Learned High Court Judge convicted the

accused for the murder, and the death sentence was imposed.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence the Accused has appealed to this

court.

The following grounds were set out in the written submission.

i. In arriving at the judgment, has the learned Trial Judge failed to consider the

contradictions in the testimonies between PW2 and PW3 which have gone to the

root of the case?

ii. Has the Learned High Court Judge not considered the infirmities and

contradictions between the evidence of the eye witness PW2 and the Specialist

Judicial Medical Officer (PW14)?

iii. Has the Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself when he determined that

it was not possible to challenge the failure of PW14 to identify the signature of the

deceased doctor who compiled the post mortem Report since the deceaseds

qualifications etc, and death was recorded as admissions under Section 420 of the

Criminal Procedure Code No 15 of 1979?

iv. Although both PW2 and PW3 have clearly stated in evidence that the deceased

and the Appellant had fought with each other, has the Learned High Court Judge

erred when he determined that there was no such fight between the deceased and

the appellant and thereby wrongly concluding that the right of Private Defence is

not available to the Appellant in an occasion of a sudden fight?

v. Has the Learned Trial Judge in his judgment failed to consider to the benefit of

the Accused Appellant the fact that PW2 and PW3 have both stated in evidence

that they have not seen the stabbing incident and further the contradictions in the

Page 4 of 13

evidence in relation to the actual place where it is alleged that a fight broke out

between the Accused and deceased?

vi. Has the Learned Trial Judge failed to consider that, the position taken by the

Appellant in his Dock Statement, that he was defending himself when this

incident happened challenges the evidence of the prosecution?

vii. Has the Learned Trial Judge erred when considering the Appellants Dock

Statement in isolation and not against the entirety of the evidence led?

viii. Has the Learned Trial Judge erroneously considered presumptions as to the

behaviour of the Appellant not recognized in law?

ix. Has the trial judges failed to consider that the evidence of PW3 corroborates the

Dock Statement of the Appellant?

x. In the totality of the evidence led, has the Learned Trial Judge failed to consider

whether the alleged act of the Appellant could be treated as one falling under a

limb of culpable homicide not amounting to murder?

xi. Has the Learned High Court Judge failed to accrue the benefit of the doubt

manifest when considering the totality of evidence to the appellant?

When the matter came for argument on the 10th of June 2020. It was the contention

of the Appellant that the Prosecution had failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt

cementing that it was the Accused that caused the death of the Deceased.

The facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that:

Page 5 of 13

According to the evidence given by the eye witness PW2 namely Panagoda Liyanage

Sanjeewa Lakshman Seneviratne, on the day in question 27th of May 2006, he hired a three

wheeler driven by the Deceased to visit his mother at Weerasooriya Kanda. Due to PW2s

necessity to take a call they stopped by a nearby shop which upon reaching they found to be

closed.

They both sat on a bed that was placed on the veranda of the shop and waited until

the shop opened. Later on, they saw PW3 arrive along with his daughter. Subsequently, the

Accused visited the shop and asked if the shop was closed and left right afterward. After 30

minutes, the Accused returned to the shop at 4:00 pm this time carrying an umbrella, charged

at the Deceased closing the umbrella and engaged in a scuffle and stabbed the Deceased in

front of the shop where they were seated.

It must be noted that the distance between PW2 and the transpiring scuffle was 6 feet

away. Albeit PW2 states that he did not see the knife but he did see the Accused stabbing the

Deceased which was affirmed in his cross examination. After the fatal events the Accused

left the crime scene with his umbrella and thereafter the Deceased holding on to his injured

and bleeding neck approached PW2 and handed the keys to PW2 to drive the three wheeler,

PW2 who possessed no knowledge of driving a three wheeler made two stops before

ultimately reaching a three wheel park upon which he sought help from another three wheel

driver who helped take the deceased to the hospital. After admitting the deceased at the

hospital, PW2 visited the Nitambuwa Police station to lodge his complaint which he later

Page 6 of 13

learned that the deceased had passed away.

: . . The main objection taken by the defense was that the witness PW2s evidence could not be believed as there are a number of contradictions and discrepancies. For that, the counsel for the Accused has mentioned the following contradictions.

1. Prior to the alleged act of the stabbing, he did not see the Accused and the

Deceased engaged in a scuffle according to the cross examination. Whereas the evidence-in-chief says that he had seen the scuffle in his witness statement.

2. Further contradictions between this witness and PW3s version. regarding to

not mentioning the group of people near the van and also not mentioning the other persons name (Dileepa). We are mindful that PW2 is a stranger to this area and PW3 is a resident of that area.

When we pursue his evidence, we don't see any major contradictions in PW2s evidence, as he is consistent throughout. Minor contradictions in evidence are usually found in witness testimony, especially when the witness has to recollect their memory years after the events. Were mindful of the observations made by Justice Thakkar with regard to the contradiction in Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai vs State of Gujarat 1983 AIR HC 753;

Page 7 of 13

(1) By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape is replayed on the mental screen. (2) ordinarily it so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to be attuned to absorb the details. (3) The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one may notice, another may not. An object or movement might emboss its image on one person's mind whereas it might go unnoticed on the part of another. (4) By and large people cannot accurately recall a conversation and reproduce the very words used by them or heard by them. They can only recall the main purport of the conversation. It is unrealistic to expect a witness to be a human tape recorder. (5) In regard to exact time of an incident, or the time duration of an occurrence, usually, people make their estimates by guess work on the spur of the moment 1.1 at the time of interrogation. And one cannot expect people to make very precise or reliable estimates in such matters. Again, it depends on the time- sense of individuals which varies from person to person (emphasis added)

In State of Uttar Pradesh v. M.K. Anthony, by D. A. Desai J, reported in Supreme Court

Journal 1984 (2) page 498,

While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be whether the

evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth. Once that impression

is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the court to scrutinize the evidence more

particularly keeping in view the deficiencies, draw-backs and infirmities pointed out in the

evidence as a whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor of

the evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of the evidence is

shaken as to render it unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not touching

the core of the case, hyper-technical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here or

there from the evidence, attaching importance to some technical error committed by the

investigating officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection

of the evidence as a whole. If the court before whom the witness gives evidence had the

opportunity to form the opinion about the general tenor of evidence given by the witness, the

appellate court which had not this benefit will have to attach due weight to the appreciation

of evidence by the trial court and unless there are reasons weighty and formidable it would

Page 8 of 13

not be proper to reject the evidence on the ground of minor variations or infirmities in the

matter of trivial details. Even honest and truthful witnesses may differ in some details

unrelated to the main incident because power of observation, retention and reproduction

differ with individuals.

(emphasis added)

The above said judgement was referred by Sisira De Abrew J, in the case of Oliver

Dayananda Kalansuriya alias Raja Vs The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, CA

28/2009 decided on 13.2.2013 his Lordship held:

His conduct is, therefore, in my view, very much compatible with a conduct of a

normal human being. It is an accepted principle that a criminal case cannot be proved with

a mathematical accuracy as it has to be proved by the evidence given by human witnesses.

Thus discrepancies, errors and contradiction are bound to occur. If they do not create a

reasonable doubt in the prosecution case court should disregard them. Courts should not

reject evidence of witnesses on the basis of minor discrepancies and contradictions.

Upon assessing the above authorities we hold that this contradiction pointed out by the

accused are trivial matters and unrelated to the main incident, therefore there is no reason

to reject his evidence.

We further hold that it is perspicuous according to what is found in the cross

examination of PW2, we cannot reject his testimony as he acts as a sole unbiased witness

and these discrepancies are not material to decide the issues in this case. Therefore PW2s

witness testimony is paramount evidence in establishing that the stabbing by the Accused

against the Deceased transpired.

PW3 namely Athugal Pedige Viraj Niroshan Amarasinghe testified according to what

he witnessed on the 27th of May 2006 at the premises of the shop he had visited along with

his daughter. Where he had met with the Deceased and PW2 while waiting for the shop to

be opened, he then went on to sit on the other side of the shop with his child.

Further, he narrated that two other people arrived one being Dileepa and the other

being the Accused whom he recognized to be Sajeewa from his village. Sajeewa returned to

the shop again after 5 to 10 minutes where he had changed his clothes previously from a

brown colored saron to a pair of brown pants and a shirt along with an umbrella, according

to PW3 the Accused had gone up to the Deceased, PW3 then heard a noise out of fear he left

the shop. He dropped his daughter off at his house which was 2 to 3 meters away when he

returned, he witnessed the Deceased running away drenched in blood where he was helped

onto the three wheeler by two other men and left the area whilst the Accused also left the

scene of the crime where he was last seen heading towards his house.

On Page 106 of the brief:

According to this evidence, it had been established the way the Accused behaved after

seeing the Deceased had gone home and changed his clothes, and returned with an umbrella

where the umbrella was used to stab the Deceased.

Page 10 of 13

This witness has corroborated the evidence of PW2 regarding the fight, the fact that the

Accused was carrying an umbrella, and the Deceased covering his bleeding neck.

PW7 Walpola Arrachilage Nihal Walopa Police inspector, states that he arrived at the

scene of the crime at 5:30 pm on the 27th of May 2006 along with some police officers. Upon

arriving at the scene of the crime, he discovered blood stains near the bed. PW7 also states

that he had visited the Accuseds house in search of him which was situated 50 meters away

from the shop but was unable to find him. Later on in the night, the Accused surrendered

himself to the Nittambuwa police at 11:45 pm on the day in question. The Accuseds

statement was obtained on the 28th of May 2006 at 6:40 am. Thereafter PW7 states that the

Accused opted to show where the knife was hidden when they conducted their search at 7:10

am on the same day, the Accused presented the knife which was concealed under a rock near

a well which was situated in the property belonging to the Accused.

This piece of evidence was not challenged by the Accused when he gave evidence in the

dock statement.

Our courts have considered the impact of the recoveries made on the information

provided by the Accused.

In Ariyasinghe And Others V Attorney General (G. C. Wickremasinghe Abduction

Case) 2004 (2) Sri L.R 357 at 386 Amaratunga J held that;.

According to the analysis, there were three ways in which the accused persons could

have acquired their knowledge about the places where G/66 notes were found. The following

are the three ways.

i. The accused himself concealed those G/66 notes found in the place where they were

found.

ii. The accused saw another person concealing the notes in that place

iii. A person who had seen another person concealing those notes in that place has told

the accused about it.

Page 11 of 13

In the instant case, the accused had not raised any objection regarding the recoveries

made under Section 27 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

The Accused not only gave the information but also guided the police to find the knife.

Considering the facts of this case, it is conspicuous that the Accused owes an explanation to

the court but he has failed in providing one. Other than a flat denial there is no explanation

offered by the Accused that would pronounce that there is no specific denial nor explanation

for the recovery of the said knife by the Accused.

PW14 Bulathsinhalage Chaminda Suranga Perera the Judicial Medical officer, as

contained in the postmortem report, it is documented that there had been 6 wounds

consisting of 2 stab wounds and 4 cut wounds. It is evident that the 1st injury which is

deduced as a stab wound was found on the left side of the neck, the cause of death had

resulted from the haemorrhage and shock which had manifested from the injuries sustained.

The Judicial Medical officer in his expert opinion gives evidence, the injuries are likely

caused by a knife like causative agent and that some force is required in order to inflict such

harm on the Deceased.

When we consider this medical evidence, the Court can come to a conclusion based on

how much force was used to inflict such an injury.

Another objection taken by the Accused was that the prosecution has failed to prove

the murderous intention.

It is pertinent that we follow the fundamental elements laid out by E,R,S,R,

Coomaraswamy in his Book The Law of Evidence (Book 2 Vol. 2 page 932) which states;

The judge must in a case of murder or culpable homicide direct the jury on the

necessary ingredients of the relevant offence;

a. The death of the deceased;

b. That the accused caused the death;

Page 12 of 13

c. That the accused had the murderous intention in a case of murder or the

necessary intention or knowledge in a case of culpable homicide not amounting

to murder.

We are mindful of the observation made by Sisira De Abrew J in the case of CA

112.2006 Thommeyahakuru Somasiri vs. Republic of Sri Lanka. decided on the11.02.08 held:

In a criminal case it is difficult for the prosecution to find direct evidence to establish the

murderous intention. The murderous intention must be understood from the factors such as,

place of injury, the weapon used, number of injuries, gravity of the injury and the force used

by the assailants.

In my view, to establish a murderous intention the authority held by His Lordship

Justice Sisira De Abrew is relevant to the instant case. It is true that there is no direct

evidence with regard to the murderous intention of the Accused In such a case, medical

evidence is very helpful to find out whether the Accused had a murderous intention to cause

the death of the Deceased. In line with the reasoning given in the above judicial authorities.

If we apply the above dictum the injury caused on the neck of the Deceased and the

force used by the Accused it is possible to establish that the Accused had a murderous

intention. In other words, the medical evidence establishes that the Accused had a murderous

intention to cause the death of the Deceased.

Now we have to consider whether the dock statement made by the Accused has

created reasonable doubt. According to the dock statement, the Accused stated that the

deceased had a knife and he had started the fight and his version not was put forward to any

witnesses.

This court is mindful that the observation made by W.L.Ranjith Silva,J with regard

to the defense version in the case CA 186/2009 Kiribandara Muhandiramlage Rohana Tissa

Kumara v. AG decided on 18.10.2011

When the prosecution witness gave evidence, the investigating officer the Appellant

never challenged him or at least suggested to him that three other people or strangers

Page 13 of 13

assaulted the deceased. Therefore the defence put forward by the Appellant that three other

people assaulted the deceased was never suggested to the witnesses for the prosecution in

cross examination and the failure to challenge or suggest the defence version to the witnesses

would be detrimental to the defence. In other words this position taken by the appellant has

to be treated as an afterthought.

We hold that the learned High Court Judge had correctly rejected the defense tendered

by the Accused.

We find that the Prosecution had submitted sufficient evidence to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, we see no reason to interfere with the judgement dated

on the 10th of June 2020, the conviction and the sentence are affirmed, and the appeal is

accordingly dismissed.
