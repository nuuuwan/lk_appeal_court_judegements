Judgment

The headquarters inspector of Police Station Puttalam has filed an information on

16.01.2016 in terms of Section 66 (1) (a) of the Primary Court Procedure Act No 44 of 1979,

in a case bearing No.110/65/15/P1 in order to prevent breach of peace among the parties.

Consequently, the learned Magistrate acting as the Primary Court Judge had published

notices in accordance with Section 66(4) of the aforementioned Act. As no other parties had

intervened in the said action it seems that other parties were not interested in the subject

matter of the action. Thereafter, the learned Magistrate had taken up the matter for inquiry.

At the inquiry party of the 1st Part-Respondents and the 2nd Party-Respondents filed their

respective affidavits, counter affidavits together with annexed documents, and written

submissions.

After the conclusion of the inquiry, the learned Magistrate made an Order on 29.07.2015

holding inter alia that he cannot make an Order under part VII of the Primary Court

Procedure Act, since the subject matter of the said action is a cemetery which does not come

within the purview of the said Act.

Whilst refusing to make an Order under the Primary Court Procedure Act, the learned

Magistrate further held that the proper authority in terms of Cemeteries and Burial grounds

Ordinance No. 9 of 1895 to hold possession is the Municipal Council of Puttalam and ordered

the service of notice on the Mayor and the Secretary of the Municipal Council of Puttalam to

act in terms of the Cemeteries and Burial Grounds Ordinance. Furthermore, the learned

Magistrate has not granted possession of the subject matter to either of the parties involved

in the dispute.

Being aggrieved by the said order dated 29.07.2015, by the learned Magistrate 1st Party-

Respondent-Petitioners had invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court

of the North-Western province holden in Puttalam. After supporting the application by the

Petitioners, the learned high court judge having been satisfied by the submissions made

before him and issued notices on the 2nd party-Respondent Respondents.

However, the 2nd party Respondent-Respondents had not filed objections but instead made

oral submissions at the hearing of the application. Thereafter the parties agreed to dispose

the matter by way of written submissions. Although the 1st-party Respondent-Petitioners filed

their written submissions, the 2nd-party Respondent-Respondents had not filed written

submissions. Subsequently, the learned high court judge pronounced the order dated

Page 5 of 13

22.11.2016 dismissing the application made by the 1st party-Respondent-Petitioners and

affirmed the order of the learned Magistrate dated 29.07.2015.

Thereafter, being dissatisfied with the said order of dismissal, the 1st party-Respondent-

Petitioner-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Appellants) have appealed against the

said dismissal to the Court of Appeal.

When this appeal was taken up for hearing, the Appellants submitted that the jurisdiction to

inquire into disputes relating to land after filing of an information in terms of Section 66 of

the Primary Court Procedure Act, vests within the Primary Court under Section 66(2) of the

said Act. Accordingly, it was submitted that the Primary Courts should inquire into the

dispute regarding which the information was filed and make a determination or an order in

the manner provided in Part VII of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

It was further submitted on behalf of the Appellants that what the Primary Court is vested

with is a limited jurisdiction to make a determination or an order as provided in Part VII of

the Act and it is not broad discretion that enables the court to abdicate jurisdiction conferred

by the Act and/or to make orders which are outside the scope of the said Act or based on

other laws.

In the instant case learned Magistrate had relied upon the ratio decedendi of the judgement

in Mansoor and another v O.I.C Avissawella Police and another [1992 (2) S.L.R. 75] where

it has been held that Where a statute creates a right and, in plain language, gives a specific

remedy or appoints a specific tribunal for its enforcement, a party seeking to enforce the

right must resort to that tribunal and not to others.

It is observable that the aforesaid case cited relates to a dispute between a tenant cultivator

and landowners, where such disputes with regard to possession were to be referred to the

Agricultural Tribunal or the Commissioner of Agrarian Society in terms of Agrarian Services

Act No. 58 of 1979.

In the instant case, the learned Magistrate resorts to the Cemeteries and Burial Grounds

Ordinance and has held that the learned Magistrate cannot make an Order under the Part

VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act. Further, it was held that since the dispute between

the parties relates to the possession of a burial ground, if possession of a cemetery/burial

ground is given to a particular person, the person getting such possession is entitled to occupy

the land in dispute and/or do any act in respect of the impugned land.

After carefully perusing the provisions of the Cemeteries and Burial Grounds Ordinance (as

amended), it clearly manifest that the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge

Page 6 of 13

had dealt with the matter operating under a wrong assumption that, possession of a cemetery

or a burial ground has been dealt under the above ordinance.

It is worthy to note that the Cemeteries and Burial Grounds does not provide for possessory

remedies. In fact, under Chapter IV of the said Ordinance only provides power to the

Magistrate Courts to adjudicate over penal offences that are set out in the Ordinance, or any

other law as stated in Section 42 of the said Ordinance. In contrast, the Agrarian Services Act

provides for resolution of disputes with regards to possession unlike the Cemeteries and

Burial Grounds Ordinance.

Under Section 42 of the said Ordinance, Magistrates Courts are hereby empowered to deal

summarily with all cases instituted under this Ordinance or any by- law made in pursuance

thereof, and to impose the full penalties herein prescribed, anything in the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, or any other enactment to the contrary notwithstanding.

It appears that the Cemeteries and Burial Grounds Ordinance does not contain any provisions

in respect of granting of possession of a disputed land. It only deals with regulations of usage

of cemeteries and burial grounds.

As such, it should be noted that the instant case is not a case instituted under the provisions

of the Cemeteries and Burial Grounds Ordinance as the remedy that is being sought is a

possessory remedy which does not fall within the ambit of the offences under the said

Ordinance.

It is noteworthy that, Cemeteries and Burial Grounds Ordinance does not specifically bar any

person of being in possession of a cemetery or burial grounds, it only prohibits the usage of

a Cemetery for other purposes.

The Learned Magistrate had come to the conclusion that he cannot grant possession to any

person other than the Proper Authority defined in the Cemeteries and Burial Grounds

Ordinance by misinterpreting the provisions of the said Ordinance.

According to Sections 6, 9.11, 17, 19. 22 and 38 of the said Ordinance, it evident that the

Proper Authority can only regulate and make by laws. Proper Authority does not have the

power to take possession or be the caretaker of the cemeteries and burial grounds.

The relevant provisions of stipulated in the Cemeteries and Burial Grounds Ordinance has

been reproduced below;

Section 6: It shall be the duty of the Municipal Council of a Municipal town, and of the

Urban Council or Town Council of a town for which an Urban Council or Town Council is

constituted, on the request of the Minister, to provide land for the purpose of the

Page 7 of 13

establishment of a general cemetery for the burial or cremation of persons dying within the

limits of such town, or for the addition to the area of any cemetery herebefore or to be

hereafter established.

Section 7: No land which shall have been consecrated or exclusively set apart for the burial

of the dead, and in which burials shall have been discontinued under the provisions of

Ordinance No. 12 of 1862* or of this Ordinance, shall be sold, disposed of, or made any use

of for any purpose whatsoever without the permission of the Minister; and every sale and

disposal of such land without the permission aforesaid shall be null and void ; and any person

making any use of such land without the permission of the Minister shall he guilty of an

offence, and be liable on conviction to a fine not less than two thousand rupees and not

exceeding five thousand rupees.

Section 9: The proper authority may authorize the erection of chapels and other buildings

for the performance of burial services or cremation within the limits of a cemetery.

Section 10(1): The proper authority may sell a portion of any cemetery for the special use of

the of any religious denomination applying for the same, and the portion so sold shall for the

purposes of this Ordinance, but for no other purpose whatever, vest in the person or persons

to whom such portion has been or may hereafter be conveyed by deed executed by the proper

authority in trust for such denomination

Section 17: The proper authority may make regulations-

(a) for ensuring that all burials within the cemetery are conducted in a decent and solemn

manner, and that the graves are of a proper depth;

(b) for setting apart any portion of any cemetery not included in the portions sold under

section 11 as a ground for cremation, and regulating the manner in which such cremation

shall be carried out;

(c) for preventing the reopening of graves within specified periods; and

(d) for defining the duties of cemetery keepers, caretakers, and grave-diggers.

Section 19(1): The proper authority may sell, or, with the sanction of the Minister, make free

grants of portions of the cemetery not included in the portions sold under section 11 of this

Ordinance, either in perpetuity or for a limited time, and, subject to any conditions which he

may think fit, the exclusive right of burial in any such portions of the cemetery so sold or

granted, or the rights of one or more burials therein, and may sell or grant the right of placing

any monument or gravestone in any part of the cemetery not included in the portions sold

under section 11, or any tablet or monumental inscription on the walls of any chapel or other

building within any such part.

Page 8 of 13

Section 22(1): The proper authority shall make regulations as to the fees to be paid to the

cemetery keeper, and the fees for the performance of burial services in respect of any portion

of any cemetery not sold or set apart for the special use of any religious denomination, and

the fees for digging graves and for cremations, and such other services in any cemetery

situated within the territorial limits of such proper authority,

Section 38: It shall be lawful for the proper authority, from time to time, to make by laws for

the following purposes:-

(a) for the inspection of burial grounds;

(b) for the proper regulation of the burial and cremation of corpses in such burial grounds,

and for ensuring that the graves are of proper depth;

(c) for the registration of burial grounds within specified areas, the limits of which shall be

therein defined;

(d) and generally for the proper management, regulation, preservation, and control of all

burial grounds, and for the maintenance of order, decency, and cleanliness within the limits

thereof, and such by-laws at any time to repeal, alter, or amend.

Therefore, the learned Magistrate has erred in law when he determined that he cannot grant

possession to either the1st Party Respondents or the 2nd Party Respondents and that he can

only grant possession to the Proper Authority. The learned Magistrate had not granted

possession of the disputed land to either party in dispute on the assumption that such Party

would get the power to do anything on the land in dispute.

However, Sections 11, 12 19, 20 and 24 of the Cemeteries and Burial Grounds Ordinance

clearly address how cemeteries may be sold, assigned or set apart for exclusive burials

therefore, parties do not have such freedom.

Furthermore, under Section 12 of Cemeteries and Burial Grounds Ordinance, it clearly states

that any land vested for a burial ground can be used only for the purpose of burial or

cremation of the dead.

Section 12 of the Ordinance is reproduced below,

No part of any cemetery shall be used for any purpose except for the purpose of a cemetery;

and any person making any other use of such land, except for the burial or cremation of the

dead and purposes relative to such burial or cremation, shall be guilty of an offence, and

liable on conviction to a fine not less than two thousand rupees and not exceeding five

thousand rupees for every such offence.

As such any person who commits any act which constitute to an offence under the ordinance,

or any other law becomes liable for punishment under the Chapter IV of the said Ordinance.

Page 9 of 13

It is imperative to note that the learned High Court Judge affirming the impugned order of

the learned Magistrate has stated that the Cemeteries and Burial Grounds Ordinance is

applicable to this dispute and Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act does not apply.

Thus, Primary Courts do not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute between the Parties.

The learned High Court Judge also relied on the case of Mansoor and another v OIC

Avissawella and another [supra] in reaching this conclusion. As the Cemeteries and Burial

Grounds Ordinance does not contain a single provision with regard to determining

possession, unlike in the case of Agrarian Services Act, which the learned Magistrate as well

as the learned High Court Judge relied upon, the above ordinance cannot be utilized to deal

with the issue of possession raised in the instant case.

Therefore, it is crystal clear that the Cemeteries and Burial Ordinance cannot be applied to

determine the possession in respect of the disputed land between the Parties of the instant

case.

Therefore, I hold that the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge had come to

an erroneous conclusion that they cannot make an order under Part VII of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act and held that Proper Authority in terms of the Cemeteries and Burial Grounds

Ordinance to hold Possession of the disputed premises is the Municipal Council of Puttalam

and has ordered to serve notices on the Mayor and the Secretary of the said Municipal

Council to take charge of the disputed property.

Thus, it appears that possession of the subject matter was not granted to any of the Parties

who claimed rights of possession, it has been granted to a party totally outside the scope of

the instant action.

It is pertinent to note that after serving notices under Section 66(4) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act neither the Municipal Council nor any other Party sought to intervene into the

instant action.

As such, the learned Primary Court Judge had given possession of the disputed premises to a

Party who is not a party to the instant action and a party who had no interest in the property

in dispute.

In view of the aforesaid reasons, it is apparent that the learned Magistrate who was acting as

the Primary Court Judge has erred in law and facts and had determined the instant action.

Therefore, the impugned order has to be set aside. As the learned High Court Judge too has

affirmed the order of the learned Magistrate, the order of the learned High Court Judge is

also set aside.

Page 10 of 13

It should be noted that as the dispute relates to the possession of a disputed land the instant

action has to be determined under Section 68(1) or Section 68(3) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act.

Section 68(1) and (3) have been reproduced below.

Section 68(1) Where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or part thereof it shall

be the duty of the Judge of Primary Court holding the inquiry to determine as to who was in

possession of the land or the part on the date of filing of the information under Section 66

and make order as to who is entitled to possession of such land or part thereof.

Section 68 (3) Where at an inquiry into a dispute relating to the right to the possession of

any land or any part of a land the Judge of the Primary Court is satisfied that any person who

had been in possession of the land or part has been forcibly dispossessed within a period of

two months immediately before the date on which the information was filed under Section

66, he may make a determination to that effect and make an order directing the party

dispossessed be restored to possession and prohibiting all disturbance of such possession

otherwise than under the authority of an order or decree of a competent Court.

Accordingly, the main issue for the determination under Section 68(1) is, as to who was in

possession of the land or part thereof on the date of filing of the information under Section

66. However, when there is an allegation of a forcible dispossession, the Court can act under

Section 68(3) and make a determination as to whether such dispossession has been affected

within two months prior to the date of filing of the information.

It is settled law that Section 68(3) becomes applicable only if the Judge of the Primary Court

can come to a definite finding that some other party had been forcibly dispossessed within a

period of 2 months immediately before the date on which the information was filed under

Section 66 of the Act.

According to Section 68(3), satisfying himself (by the Judge) of such forcible dispossession

within the said time period is a necessary and mandatory pre-requisite when making a

determination to that effect. It is only if such a determination could be made, the Judge of the

Primary Court is empowered to make an order of restoration of possession. In other words,

the Section bears no ambiguity, hence if the Judge of the Primary Court is not satisfied that

there has been such forcible dispossession within two months prior to the filing of

information, he is neither expected to make a determination, nor a subsequent order of

restoration of possession.

Furthermore, Section 68(3) of the Act, emphasizes the need for a Judge to satisfy the elements

of a forcible dispossession. Since the Primary Court Judge is empowered to make an order of

Page 11 of 13

restoration of possession, it could be made only after a determination of forcible

dispossession.

In order to make such a determination court also draws attention to section 72 of the Primary

Courts Act. In terms of Section 72 of the Act, A determination and order under this part shall

be made after examination and consideration of

(a) the information filed and the affidavits and documents furnished;

(b) such other evidence on any matter arising on the affidavits or documents furnished as

the court may permit to be led on that matter; and

(c) such oral or written submission as may be permitted by the Judge of the Primary Court in

his discretion.

The information was filed by the Headquarters Inspector of Police station of Puttalam on

16.01.2015, the learned Magistrate has to look into the period of 2 months prior to the date

of filing of information with regard to the determination of possession under Section 68 of

the Act. It appears that this period is between 16.11.2014 to 16.01.2015.

It is seen from the evidence placed before the learned Magistrate, the party of the first part

had employed security personnel in the disputed premises and they had vacated the premises

on 13.01.2014 due to a dispute with regard to the payment of wages.

This position is substantiated by the statement (2 7) made by security personnel Sanath

Kalinga Wewansa to the Police station of Puttalam on 18.01.2015. He has stated that he went

to the land in question on 21.10.2014 and stayed there on behalf of the church (Appellants)

looking after that land.

Initially he was paid LKR 45,000 and subsequently the amount was reduced by the company.

Therefore, due to a dispute with regard to the payment of wages he vacated the land on

13.01.2015.

The said position was further established by the fact that after the initial complaints made by

both Parties in July and August 2014, the only other complaint had been made on

12.10.2014 by the 1st Appellant with regard to a trespass. Consequent to the said complaint

the 1st Respondent namely Moses De Silva was arrested and produced in court.

It was submitted on behalf of the Appellants that thereafter there had been no attempts by

the Respondents to encroach on to or trespass into the land in question until the security

personal vacated the disputed premises on 13.01.2015.

Page 12 of 13

In these circumstances, it is apparent that the Appellants were in possession two months prior

to the date of filing of the information.

The attention of the court was drawn to the order made by the learned Magistrate - which

states that the Appellants had taken various steps after 27.07.2014 to secure their possession

- such as securing the boundaries by putting up a metal sheet cover, employing security

personal, establishing a tube well and a toilet at the land and obtaining electricity. The

learned magistrate had observed that all the documenting evidence produced by the

Appellants are related to the period from October to November 2014.

Further, the learned Magistrate stated that prior to the complaint made to the Police

regarding destroying of tombs on the burial grounds, no evidence was produced by the

Respondents to establish their possession to the disputed premises.

In view of the evidence placed before the learned Magistrate it is seen that the Respondents

had not adduced any evidence to establish their possession two months prior to the date of

filing of the information. Thus, the Respondents had not proved their possession to the

disputed premises for the relevant period in terms of section 68(3) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act.

In this instance, courts attention is drawn to the instrument dated 28.02.1879 marked and

produced in evidence as 1 and 12. It is a crown grant given by Governor of Ceylon set

apart for special use of the Church of England for burial of Anglicans. Thus, the members of

the Church of England (now known as the Church of Ceylon) have every right to be in

possession of the disputed land.

It is observable that the Appellants are members of the clergy of the Church of Ceylon

(Anglican Institution) and the Respondents are not members of the Church of Ceylon and

they have clearly stated that they are Roman Catholics.

The aforesaid reasons, clearly manifests that the possession of the disputed land was with

clergy of the Church of Ceylon throughout since the Crown grant was made in 1879.

In view of the foregoing reasons, it clearly shows that the Appellant had been in possession

of the disputed premises for the relevant period and their possession was disturbed by the

Respondents on or before 14.01.2015 thereby dispossessing Appellants from the disputed

property.

As such, in terms of Section 68(3) of the Primary Court Procedure Act, Appellants are entitled

to be restored to possession and all disturbances of such possession otherwise than under the

authority of an order or decree of a competent court are hereby prohibited.

Page 13 of 13

In light of the foregoing, this court vacates the learned Magistrate's order dated 29.07.2015,

finding that the learned Magistrate had erred in law and fact by assuming that the Cemeteries

and Burial Grounds Ordinance deals with possession of a burial ground and granting

possession to the Proper Authority. This court holds that such a manifest error in law

amounts to exceptional grounds required to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court. Therefore, the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Puttalam

dated 22.11.2016, which affirms the learned Magistrate's order, is also hereby set aside.

Furthermore, pursuant to Section 68(3) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, this court

orders the possession of the disputed premises (cemetery) to be granted to the Appellants (the

Church of Ceylon).

Hence, the Appeal is allowed.
