Judgement

The Officer-in-charge of the Police station of Yakkalamulla being the Complainant, had filed an

information on 23.03.2010 in the Magistrate court of Kottawa in terms of section 66(1)(a) of

the Primary Court Procedure Act no 44 of 1979. It was informed to court by the said information

that the breach of peace is threatened or likely to be threatened due to a dispute between the 1st

Party and the 2nd Party.

The learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge had inquired into the matter

between the said Parties and delivered the order on 13.07.2010 determining that 2nd Party is not

entitled to a servitudanal right over the subject matter and possession of the same was handed

over to the 1st Party.

Being aggrieved by the said order the 2nd Party 1st and 2nd Petitioners had invoked the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial high Court of the Southern Province holden in Galle.

The learned High Court Judge having inquired the matter before him, and affirmed the order of

the learned Magistrate.

Thereafter, the 2nd Party 1st and 2nd Party Petitioners being aggrieved by the order of the learned

High Court judge had preferred this appeal to the Court of Appeal seeking relief prayed in the

prayer of the Petition of Appeal.

It is observable in the prayer to the Petition of Appeal, that the 2nd Party-1st and 2nd Petitioner-

Appellants (herein after referred to as the Appellants) had prayed only to revise or set aside the

order of the Learned Magistrate and not sought to set aside or revise the order of the learned

High Court Judge against which this appeal was preferred.

Be that as it may, the facts of the instant case is as follows;

The dispute between the Parties is relating to a right of way claimed by the Appellants over a

land belonging to the 1st Party-1st and 2nd Respondent-Respondents.

Therefore, it appears that the dispute affecting the subject matter comes within the purview of

section 75(d) of the said Act (reproduced below).

Section 75(d): In this Part dispute affecting land includes any dispute as to the right to the

possession of any land or part of a land and the buildings thereon or the boundaries thereof or

as to the right to cultivate any land or part of a land, or as to the right to the crops or produce of

any land, or part of a land, or as to any right in the nature of a servitude affecting the land and

any reference to land in this Part includes a reference to any building standing thereon.

Thus, it is the burden of the Appellants to prove that they have a right to use the disputed pathway

in the nature of servitude.

It was submitted on behalf of the Appellants that the Appellants enjoyed the disputed pathway

from 1990 1999 and the only access road to their land lies over the land belonging to the

Respondent.

5 of 7

It was further submitted that the pathway which was originally used by the Appellants was

closed by the Respondents and thereafter a new pathway was provided from the same land and

the dispute arose after the said new pathway was closed.

It was the contention of the Appellants that they have been enjoying the disputed pathway as a

right of way in the nature of a servitude and the said right has been created by enjoying the same

since 1990 by the predecessor of the Appellants up-to date.

Thus, the learned Magistrate and the learned high Court Judge had failed to consider the

aforesaid affidavit marked 21, and the Appellants have the right to use the disputed pathway

since 1990.

Furthermore, it was submitted that Gramaniladari has reported in his report that he was aware

that the Appellants were enjoying the right of way over Dayawathis land.

Moreover, the Appellants submitted that their supporting affidavits demonstrate that Appellant

did not have an alternative roadway other than the disputed pathway.

However, it is imperative to note that according to the Appellants the roadway which was

originally used was closed by the Respondents. Afterwards, Respondents provided a new

pathway. Thus, it seems that the Respondents had given license to the Appellants to use the new

pathway.

The section 72 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act stipulates that,

A determination and order under this Part shall be made after examination and

consideration of-

(a) the information filed and the affidavits and documents furnished;

(b) such other evidence on any matter arising on the affidavits or documents furnished

as the court may permit to be led on that matter; and

(c) such oral or written submission as may be permitted by the Judge of the Primary Court

in his discretion.

The dispute between the Parties is a matter to be adjudicated by a competent civil court. On the

other hand, it was revealed in affidavit evidence that the Appellants do not have an alternative

road access to their land.

6 of 7

As such, it is also a matter to be determined by a civil court whether the Appellants can claim a

servitudanal right by way of necessity or prescription.

The attention of court was drawn to the affidavit given by one Mahadurage Namaratne [marked

as 21]. According to the said affidavit the land occupied by the Appellants is a state land called

Walaemba Mukulana in extent of 3 acres.

The said Namaratne had enjoyed the property since 1990 and has handed over the same to the

Appellants for them to apply for a permit in their name from the state. Subsequently, Appellants

started enjoying the property since 1999.

It is seen that, the only access road to the said land enjoyed by the Appellants, lay over the land

belonging to the Respondents.

Nevertheless, the Respondents have taken up the position that the said land occupied by the

Appellants were not owned by them and it is a state land. Thus, the Respondents contended that

the dominant land is a state land, and no prescription will run against a state land even though the

Appellants have possessed the same for well over 10 years.

In this respect, it is worthy to note that the Appellants are claiming a right of way over the

Respondents land and not claiming a prescriptive title over the state land.

Although the dominant land is a state land, it is not a matter to be considered in terms of section

66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act, since question regarding title of land does not arise.

The order of the court made in actions instituted under section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure

Act are provisional orders, made to resolve the dispute temporarily to preserve the peace

between/among the Parties.

It appears that the learned Magistrate held that no resident, occupying an unauthorised land can

claim a servitudanal right by way of prescription.

It is settled law that under section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act, the Primary Court Judge

has no jurisdiction to question or determine the title of the disputed land or the land relating to the

dispute.

Therefore, it is imperative to note that the learned Magistrate had come to an erroneous conclusion

that the Appellants are precluded by claiming a right of way over the Respondents land.

7 of 7

Hence, I hold that the learned Magistrate had misled himself and had not come to a correct finding

of fact and law. Thus, the learned Magistrate had erred in law and thereby held against the 2nd

Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant.

In view of the aforesaid reasons, we set aside the order dated 13.07.2010 of the learned Magistrate

and hold that the 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant is entitled to use the impugned

pathway to access the land occupied by the Appellants.

The learned Provincial High Court judge affirmed the findings of the learned Magistrate and

dismissed the revision application on the ground that no exceptional grounds exist to revise the

order of the learned Magistrate since we hold that the learned Magistrate had come to an erroneous

conclusion and held against the 2nd Party-1st and 2nd Petitioner-Appellants, we set aside the order

made by the learned Provincial High Court Judge dated 13.6.2012 as well.

Therefore, we allow the appeal of the 2nd Party-1st and 2nd Petitioner-Appellants and order the cost

to be paid by the Respondents.

Appeal allowed with cost.
