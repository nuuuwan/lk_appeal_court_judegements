JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The Criminal Investigation Department had filed a case against

Jayaweera Muhandiram Premaratne the Accused-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the Accused) for committing criminal breach

of trust upon a complaint lodged by the Complainant-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) in the Magistrate Court of

Colombo under the case No. 34991/2/15 on 03.10.2016.

As the property involved in the case is a Montero Jeep bearing

registration No. WP-KI 9486, the Learned Magistrate held an inquiry

under Section 431 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979

and handed over the possession of the vehicle to the 2nd Party-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) by his order

dated 03.10.2016. The Learned Magistrate had considered number of

judgments for and against of handing over the vehicle to the person

who had possessed last when the matter came before the court.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Magistrate, the Appellant filed a

revision application in the Provincial High Court of Western Province

Holden at Colombo to revise the order of the Magistrate of Colombo.

After an inquiry, the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo had

affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate of Colombo and dismissed

the said revision application subject to a cost of Rs.100000/ payable to

Respondent.

Now the Appellant filed this appeal to set aside the both orders of the

Learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 11/05/2018 and Learned

Magistrate of Colombo dated 03.10.2016 and to declare that the

Appellant is entitled to possess the vehicle bearing registration No. WP

KI 9486.

Background of the case albeit as follows:

The Appellant had purchased the subject matter the Montero Jeep from

W.M.W. Mohammed Aslam of Mawanella for a sum of Rs.6.5 million on

open papers. At the time of the purchase, the registered owner of the

vehicle was one Sujeevi Sandra Samaranayeke as per the documents he

had received.

As the Appellant wanted to sell the said vehicle, he entrusted the same

to the Accused who is a known associate of him for a long period of

time. In November 2014, the Accused had informed the Appellant that

he had found a prospective buyer for a sum of Rs.6.2 million and the

Accused had paid an advanced of Rs.400000/- which was

acknowledged by the Appellant in writing.

As the transaction was not materialized as expected the Appellant had

contacted the Accused several times but he was not satisfied with the

explanations given by the Accused. As such he had gone to the Accused

premises to collect the vehicle but was not to be found in the premises

of the Accused. Hence, he had lodged a complaint against the Accused

in the Criminal Investigation Department on 21.09.2015. As up to that

point the said vehicle was on open papers, the Appellant took steps to

register the same in his name and accordingly it was transferred in to

his name on the 05.06.2016.

After the investigation the Criminal Investigation Department had

arrested and produced the Accused before the Magistrate Court of

Colombo. The aforementioned vehicle was seized from the possession of

the Respondent and produced before the Court. At present the main

case is pending before the Magistrate Court of Colombo.

The Appellant submitted following grounds of appeal:

1. The orders of the Learned High Court Judge and the Magistrate

are contrary and against the weight of evidence as vehicle in

question is registered in the name of the Appellant.

CA PHC 99/18

5 | P a g e

2. Both the Learned magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge

had come to wrong conclusion that the Respondent is a bona

fide purchaser.

3. The Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge had

failed to consider Section 2(1) of the Motor traffic Act which

states that the person for the time being entitled to the

possession of the vehicle is registered as the owner.

4. The Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge

erred in handing over the vehicle to the party whose possession

it was in prior to being taken in by the police under section

431(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code when the registered

owner of the vehicle was available and was therefore entitled to

possession.

5. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider that in any

event the title of the vehicle has not passed on to the

Respondent.

6. In any event costs of Rs.100000/- is excessive considering the

nature of the case.

As the 1st to 5th appeal grounds are interconnected, all said appeal

grounds will be considered together in this appeal.

The Learned Magistrate after considering plethora of Assizes Court

decisions come to a conclusion that the Respondent is a bona fide

purchaser and therefore, his possession of the vehicle had not caused

no any illegality. Therefore, proceeded to release the said vehicle to the

Respondent. The relevant portion of the order of the Learned Magistrate

is re-produced below:

The Learned High Court Judge while agreeing with the order of the

Learned Magistrate went in to say that the Appellant knowing that the

vehicle was sold to a third party, got the vehicle registered in his name.

As such the Appellant had not come before the High Court with clean

hands. The relevant portion of the order of the Learned High Court

Judge is re-produced below:

The position of the Appellant is that in November 2014, as per the

entrustment to sell his vehicle, the accused had informed the Appellant

that he had found a prospective buyer for a sum of Rs.6.2 million and

paid an advanced of Rs.400000/- which was acknowledged by the

Appellant in writing. After receiving the advance payment of

Rs.400000/- from the accused, the Appellant heard nothing from the

Accused nor from anybody regarding the sale of the vehicle to a third

party. As he could not find the vehicle from the Accuseds premises the

Appellant took steps to register the vehicle in his name and lodged a

complaint at the Criminal Investigation Department.

Further, the Respondent who claims that he bought the vehicle from

the Accused on 21.10.2014, had not taken any meaningful action to

register the vehicle in his name till the complaint was lodged at the

Criminal Investigation Department on 21.09.2015 by the Appellant.

The failure to act within the law and tender to the Registrar of Motor

Vehicles the necessary documents to register the ownership of the

vehicle in his name by the Respondent, clearly demonstrates that he is

not a bona fide purchaser. Had he been the bona fide purchaser he

should have taken meaningful and legal action to register the said

vehicle in his name. Also, he should have approached the Appellant to

have all original documents to act on the registration.

Further, the Respondent had not taken any endeavour to contact the

Appellant to get the necessary documents to register the vehicle in his

name. According to the Appellant, the Respondent had only contacted

him after the case was filed. This lethargic attitude of the Respondent

also amplifies the demonstration that he is not a bona fide purchaser.

In Sugathapala v. Thambirajah 67 NLR 91 the court held that:

that it is open to a Magistrate, when he acts under section

419 (1), to direct the property found in the possession of one

person to be delivered to another person who is entitled to

possess it. Section 419 has conferred jurisdiction on the

CA PHC 99/18

8 | P a g e

Magistrate to decide who is entitled to the possession of such

property. In exercising that power, the Magistrate is not

deciding a civil dispute, but only the right of possession in

respect of the property. In the absence of anything to show

the title to the property, it should be ordered to be delivered

to the person in whose possession it was when it was seized

by the police.

Considering the above cited judicial decision, I set aside the order dated

03.10.2016 by the Learned Magistrate of Colombo and the order of the

Learned High Court Judge dated 11.05.2018 as they cannot be allowed

to stand.

I direct that the vehicle No. WP-KI 9486 which was the subject matter of

this action shall be released to the Appellant who is the registered

owner of the vehicle.

Therefore, this appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this order to the

High Court of Colombo and the Magistrate Court of Colombo along with

the original case record for necessary action forthwith.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

SAMPATH B. ABAYAKOON, J.

I agree.
