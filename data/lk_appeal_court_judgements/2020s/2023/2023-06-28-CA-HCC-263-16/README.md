This is an appeal filed by the 2nd Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the Accused) against an Order of the learned High Court Judge of Nuwara Eliya

dated 9th August 2016 in terms of Section 241(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code

refusing his application to set aside the conviction and sentence and for the Accused

to be tried de novo. The Petition of Appeal dated 18th August 2018 prays for setting

aside the substantive conviction (the Accused was convicted of counts 1 to 8 in the

indictment by judgment dated 15th July 2014) or, in the alternative, an imposition of

a lenient sentence. It must be noted that this Petition does not seek to revise or set

aside the Order of the learned High Court Judge made in terms of Section 241(3). The

learned High Court Judge refused the same on the basis that the Accused was not

able to demonstrate that his absence from the trial was bona fide.

The learned Counsel for the Respondent raised a preliminary objection on the

maintainability of this appeal, specifically that the Accused has in effect appealed the

substantive conviction, which is now out of time (conviction date is 15th July 2014),

having not sought to revise the Order of the learned High Court Judge in terms of

Section 241(3). As such, the question this Court is grappling with is whether the

Accused is entitled to appeal the substantive conviction in the absence of a prayer to

set aside the Order made in terms of Section 241(3) (if there is such a right of appeal)

or an application by way of revision to set aside the Order in terms of Section 241(3)

which was made on 9th of August 2016.

According to Section 241(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, after the

conclusion of the trial of an Accused person in his absence if he appears before Court

and satisfies the Court that his absence at the trial was bona fide the Court shall set

aside the conviction and sentence and order that the Accused be tried de novo. If the

Accused is unsuccessful the initial conviction and sentence stand unchallenged.

To support his stance that the Accused is entitled to an unconditional right of

appeal the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner strongly relied on several

judgments of the Supreme Court which expound the sanctity of the right of appeal.

One of which is the notable judgment of Sudharman v. Attorney General [1986] 1

SLR 9. In the said judgment his Lordship Sharvananda C.J. contended that an

Accused is not estopped by his contumacious conduct from invoking the statutorily

conferred right to appeal against a sentence and conviction. In what appears to be an

interesting exchange with the Counsel for the Respondent their Lordships had posed

the question, what was the distinct advantage which an absconding accused had

over persons who respected the law and presented themselves for trial. In response

to which, their Lordships observed, he [Counsel for the Respondent] was hard put to

demonstrate such advantage. He had to concede that, on the other hand, an accused

who presents himself for trial will definitely be at an advantage in that he will be

able to cross-examine prosecution witnesses and himself give evidence and call

witnesses in his support.

Their Lordships held (at p. 13):

Section 14 of the Judicature Act has specifically endowed an accused who is

convicted with a substantive right namely, a right of appeal and this right of appeal

cannot be taken away from him, on the ground that he had been acting

contumaciously or in defiance of the law. When the legislature has vested in the

accused an absolute right of appeal "as a matter of right" it is not open to a court to

qualify or condition that right on the ground that "An appeal as a matter of right can

be available only to a person who obeys the law and its sanctions and not to any

person who has defied and acted in contempt of it." The Court of Appeal has taken

the view that to recognise such a "right in the appellant can only have the effect of

bringing the law and the institutions of justice into ridicule and contempt. [emphasis

added]

In a more recent judgment, H.K. Sumanasena v. Mallawarchchige Kanishka

Gunawadhana SC Appeal No. 201/2014 S.C. Minute 15.03.2018, his Lordship

Aluwihare P.C. J. analyzing the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil

and Political Rights Act No. 56 of 2007 (ICCPR Act), specifically Section 4(2),

explained that the said Section stipulates that every person convicted of a criminal

offence under any matter shall have the right of appeal to a higher court against such

conviction and any sentence imposed. His Lordship further observed (at p. 8):

In instances where no right of appeal is conferred by a statute, a party

aggrieved, could invoke the revisionary jurisdiction to have a decision of an original

court reviewed and our courts have always recognized revisionary jurisdiction in such

instances. The provision embodied in Section 4 (2) of the ICCPR Act has now

expanded the scope (of jurisdiction) to appeals in the case of all criminal offences.

While the expansion of the appellate jurisdiction by virtue of section 4 (2) of the

ICCPR Act relates exclusively to criminal cases, concomitantly, it must be stated,

that Section 4 (2) of the ICCPR Act has no application whatsoever to civil cases.

Contrary to the stance of the Accused, the learned Counsel for the Respondent

heavily contended that as long as the Order of the learned High Court Judge in terms

of Section 241(3) is not revised or set aside there is a barrier in the Accuseds path to

invoke this Courts appellate jurisdiction. Learned Counsel relied on the judgment of

N. Arumugam v. T. Kumaraswamy [2000] BLR 55. His Lordship Wigneswaran J. in

the Court of Appeal observed that in terms of the Civil Procedure Code a Defendant

who does not participate in the trial must first purge his default in terms of Section

86 if he is to get into the case legitimately. The Court observed (at p.58):

The learned Presidents Counsel argued that only if a judgment is entered in

favour of the Plaintiff against a Defendant on his default that the Defendant is

expected to purge his default. This is not so. The defendant having failed to file his

answer in terms of Section 84 is deemed to be in default. To be in default means that

Page 6 of 10

the Defendant had neglected to do what the law required. His neglect has nothing to

do with the judgment being given in favour of the Plaintiff or against him. His

primary duty is to Court to have his default purged. Only on his default being purged

would the Defendant have a right of audience before Court. [emphasis added]

It is a well-established principle of law that an appeal is a continuation of

proceedings from the original court. Although both Sudharman (supra) and

Arumugam (supra) appear to be diametrically opposed to each other, the one common

ground is this principle.

In Sudharman (supra), his Lordship Sharvananda C.J. held (at p. 13):

An appeal is not a fresh suit but is only a continuation of the original proceedings

and a stage in that suit itself.

In Arumugam (supra) this Court citing Justice Soertz in De Silva v. Edward

30 CLW 81 and 82 observed (at p. 57):

the effect of a right of appeal is the limitation of one jurisdiction and the

extension of the jurisdiction to another. What this means is that the status of parties

do not change on appeal. When the original Court had been clothed with the

jurisdiction to grant permission to participate or to be excluded from proceedings, it

is that Court which has the right to make such an order. [emphasis added]

As such, this appeal cannot be looked at as a fresh suit.

An Accused is not compelled to avail the benefit of the provisions of Section

241(3). It is in the interests of and in furtherance of the sacred right of a fair trial

that the legislature has been merciful to permit an Accused who has been absent from

trial (provided his absence was bona fide) the ability to purge that default. Thus,

Page 7 of 10

whether an Accused seeks to reopen proceedings in terms of Section 241(3) is their

choice. If the Accused does not opt to do so, there is nothing preventing the Accused

from directly appealing the substantive conviction as well, as clearly opined in the

aforementioned judgment of Sudharman (provided, however, that the appeal is filed

on time).

If, however, an Accused does submit himself to the jurisdiction of the Court in

terms of Section 241(3) then it is incumbent upon him to satisfy Court that his

absence was bona fide. His failure to so satisfy would result in the substantive

conviction standing as it is. If his application under Section 241(3) is rejected he

would be out of time to challenge the substantive conviction and sentence (vide CA

Appeal No. 81/2003 CA Minutes 22.10.2007 reported in (2007) ACJ 181).

If he is able to so satisfy Court then he is entitled to the privilege of leading

evidence and cross-examining witnesses, which is less burdensome than having to

convince a judge sitting in appeal of his innocence (if he is convicted). That is an

incentive legislature has offered for an Accused (whose absence was genuine and not

to circumvent the law) to purge his default. Further, in an appeal, unlike in the

reopening of proceedings in terms of Section 241(3), the presumption of innocence is

lost. As her Ladyship Shiranee Tilakawardena J. noted in Attorney General v.

Letchchemi [2006] BLR 16 at 17, ..the presumption of innocence that inures in

favour of those suspected or accused or connected with the commission of an offence,

ceases to operate after conviction by a Court of competent jurisdiction. Indeed, after

conviction the burden shifts to the accused.

In the instant matter, the Accused tried to reopen proceedings and purge the

default. The learned High Court Judge has not held in his favour. The resulting

position is that his substantive conviction stands valid. There was no attempt to

revise or appeal this Order or any challenge to the learned High Court Judges

findings. In the Petition of Appeal dated 18th August 2016 what is prayed for is,

reproduced verbatim, as follows:

1. .

2. .

3. .

Thus, it is seen that there is nothing prayed for to set aside or vacate the Order

made in terms of Section 241(3) agitating that the learned High Court Judge was

wrong to conclude that his absence was not bona fide. Instead, what is sought is the

wiping out of the substantive conviction or a lenient sentence. In the facts of the

present case, the absence of such a challenge leads us to believe that the application

made under Section 241(3) was made for the purpose of trying to take a second bite

of the cherry by circumventing the time limit within which an appeal must be lodged;

time which the Accused is clearly out of.

This is not a devaluation of the right of appeal of the Accused. Indeed, the value

of such a right has been reiterated and its significance dealt with in many judgments

of this Court and the Supreme Court. For instance, her Ladyship Shiranee

Thilakawardane J. in Gunasekara v. Attorney General [2012] BLR 215 held (at p.

217):

It is important to note the right of appeal is a fundamental human right

enshrined by domestic and international law.

Her Ladyship citing Section 4(2) of the ICCPR Act observed (at p. 217):

Page 9 of 10

[Section 4(2)] states that every person convicted of a criminal offence under

any written law shall have the right to appeal to a Higher Court against such

conviction any sentence imposed and therefore as of right a convicted person has a

right to have that conviction and sentence reviewed by a higher forum. Perhaps some

irregularity in procedure may deprive the Appellants of the opportunity to file his

appeal within the time prescribed by law. But the right to review is a recognised

substantive right.

Thus, the right of appeal, although as the nomenclature suggests is claimed as

of right, there are certain procedural steps that must be complied with to enjoy the

benefit of this right. One imperative procedural requirement is the time requirement.

An application cannot be made under Section 241(3) merely for the purpose of

circumventing the strict requirement of Section 331(1) of the Criminal Procedure

Code, and indirectly claiming a right of appeal. The absence of a challenge to the

Order of the learned High Court Judge which has disbelieved the version of the

Accused appears, ex facie from the two Petitions of Appeal which have sought

identical relief that, to have been filed for the purpose of circumventing the time bar.

The benefit conferred on an Accused who was absent from a trial because of bona fide

reasons cannot be taken advantage of by an Accused that has failed in the bona fide

test to circumvent a well established and a well honoured time limit.

We are of the view that the Accused filed the application in terms of Section

241(3) for the purpose of circumventing this imperative time limit for filing an appeal.

We were also invited to exercise our ample revisionary jurisdiction to set aside

or revise the substantive conviction. However, the absence of a challenge to the

learned High Court Judges finding that his absence from the trial was not bona fide,

a finding that remains uncontroverted; an absence of any explanation from the

Accused as to the reason such finding was not challenged; and an absence of any

evidence to controvert such finding before this forum leads us to the inescapable

Page 10 of 10

conclusion that the discretionary revisionary jurisdiction must not be exercised in

favour of the Accused.

As observed by his Lordship Sharvananda C.J. Sudharman (supra) at p. 14,

Contumacious conduct on the part of the applicant is a relevant consideration when

the exercise of a discretion in his favour is involved. Citing this dictum, his Lordship

Janak De Silva J. in Rankothpedige Harindra Prasad v. Attorney General CA PHC

APN 81/2015 CA Minutes 26.01.2018 concluded (at p. 6), the Accused, who by his

contumacious conduct placed himself beyond the reach of the law in treating the

original courts and their authority with contempt, should not be allowed to invoke

the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.

Additionally, our conclusion is buttressed by the absence of any exceptional

circumstances pleaded, which is the threshold requirement for this discretionary

jurisdiction to be invoked.

We, therefore, uphold the preliminary objection raised by the learned Counsel

for the Respondent. This appeal is dismissed.
