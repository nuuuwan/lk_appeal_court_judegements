32nd and 33rd Respondents C/O The Registrar University of Kelaniya, Kelaniya Respondents

Before: M. T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

S. U. B. KARALLIYADDE, J. Counsel: K.G. Jinasena, instructed by D.K. Vikum Jayantha for the Petitioner. N. De Zoysa SC for the 1st to 25th and 31st Respondents. Argued on: 07.08.2023 Written Submissions on: 14.10.2023 by the Petitioners Filed out of time by the Respondents. Decided on: 07.12.2023 MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioner is seeking, inter-alia a Writ of Certiorari quashing the

decision of the Council of the University of Kelaniya to issue letters

of Appointment in the Department of Pali and Buddhist Studies at

the Faculty of Humanities to the 26th, 27th and 28th Respondents. The

Petitioner also seeks a Writ of Certiorari quashing the letter of

Appointment issued by the Council of the University of Kelaniya for

the post of Lecturer (Probationary) in the Department of Pali and

Page 4 of 9

Buddhist Studies at the Faculty of Humanities, a Writ of Certiorari

quashing the decision of the University of Kelaniya to appoint the

32nd Respondent for the post of Lecturer (Probationary) in the

Department of Pali and Buddhist Studies at the Faculty of

Humanities, a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of Selection

Committees to recommend the 32nd Respondent for the post of

Lecturer (Probationary) in the Department of Pali and Buddhist

Studies at the Faculty of Humanities of the University of Kelaniya, a

Writ of Quo Warranto to declare that the 26th, 27th,28th and 32nd

Respondents are not eligible and entitle in law to hold the said

positions as Lecturer (Unconfirmed) and Lecturer (Probationary) in

the Department of Pali and Buddhist Studies at the Faculty of

Humanities of the University of Kelaniya and to issue a Writ of

Mandamus compelling the Council of the University of Kelaniya of

which 2nd and 22nd Respondents are members to appoint the

Petitioner for a post of Lecturer (Unconfirmed) or Lecturer

(Probationary) in the Department of Pali and Buddhist Studies

Faculty of Humanities at the University of Kelaniya.

However, there are two preliminary objections taken by the State

Counsel for the 1st to 25th Respondents and the 31st Respondent as

to the maintainability of this Application. In the first of these

objections the Counsel for the Respondents submits that the

Petitioner has already invoked the alternative remedy provided under

Section 86 of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 by going before the

Universities Services Appeal Board. Secondly, he submits, that the

Petitioner has failed to make a frank and full disclosure of all relevant

Page 5 of 9

material facts, in specific that the Petitioner has suppressed material

facts pertaining to the invocation of the alternative remedy by the

Petitioner.

Given two preliminary objections were raised, I move to adjudicate

on these first. It can be said that a preliminary objection by Nature

is such that, it obviates the need for any consideration to be given to

the Merits of the case. In support I cite the case of Sangamaya Vs.

Sri Lanka Ports Authority and another1 wherein Thilakawardena,

J. stated that,

.A determination of a preliminary objection obviates or makes

unnecessary, any consideration of the facts contained in the

pleadings and/or the merits of the case..

It is trite law that a Preliminary objection is not limited to rise out of

a pure question of law but that it may be given rise to as a mixed

question of law and fact or on a question of fact alone where there

are ex facie either no dispute or a frivolous dispute on the

fundamental facts that are being urged before the court and

contained in the pleadings that have been filed.

However, while it is tempting to take Preliminary Objections to

dismiss a matter in limine to dispose of that matter expeditiously, it

is important to give proper consideration to the question of a

Preliminary Objection, in other words to not conflate every objection

as a preliminary objection and to give due consideration for the need

1 [2003] 3 Sri. L.R 146 at 148.

Page 6 of 9

for justice to be done in each case. For these reasons, I shall

emphasize how a clear distinction of a Preliminary objection can be

drawn. There are two considerations for the Court in this regard.

Firstly, whether it prima facie appears to be a question on the

maintainability of an Application or on the basis of the assumption

of the truth of all the averments of fact made by the suitor. Secondly,

whether the objection before the Court is one which can be taken in

argument though not raised in the written defence. If both these

criterium are met, the objection raised may qualify as a Preliminary

Objection.

In the immediate matter, the Court on the question of the first

preliminary objection is confronted with a question of law. Mainly,

whether the Petitioners Application should be dismissed as he has

invoked an alternative remedy and has invoked the discretionary

jurisdiction while that matter is pending. To delineate our law in this

regard I would like to quote from a recent judgement of this Court. In

Pinnaduwage Baby Mallika Chandraseana vs C.W Abeysuriya2

having carefully considered judicial developments in the law this

Court held,

Prerogative Writs are discretionary remedies, and therefore, the

Petitioner is not entitled to invoke the Writ jurisdiction of this

Court when there is an alternative remedy available to him.

However, this Court further held

2 CA/WRIT/457/2019

Page 7 of 9

It is to be noted that, the alternative remedy is, always, not a

bar to invoke the Writ jurisdiction of this Court. If the Court is of

the view that, the alternative remedy is inadequate, where there

has been a violation of the principle of Natural Justice, where the

impugned order is without jurisdiction and there are errors on the

face of the record, the Petitioner is permitted to invoke the Writ

jurisdiction before exhausting the alternative remedies provided

in law.

According to Section 86 (a) of the Universities Act No.16 of 1978

which reads,

The Appeals Board shall have and may exercise the following

powers, duties and functions:

(a) to conduct investigations into appointments and promotions

alleged to have been made to the staff of the Commission and

to Higher Educational Institutions in contravention of the

schemes of recruitment and the procedures for appointment in

force at the time such appointments or promotions were made;

It is the view of this Court that in the immediate matter there is an

adequate and effectious statutory remedy provided to redress the

Petitioners grievances under Section 86 of the Universities Act No.16

of 1978. Therefore, in the instant Application since the Petitioner has

already invoked an alternative remedy provided in law, while that

matter is pending the necessity to invoke the Writ jurisdiction of this

Court does not arise.

Page 8 of 9

In regard to the second preliminary objection, the uberrima fides duty

of the Petitioner to make a full and frank disclosure of all material

facts relevant to an Application. Our law in this regard can be

summed up by the case of, Fonseka vs. Lt. General Jagath

Jayasuriya and Five Others3 wherein a divisional bench of this

Court held that,

a Petitioner who seeks relief by writ which is an extra-ordinary

remedy must in fairness to Court, bare every material fact so that

the discretion of Court is not wrongly invoked or exercised.

Further, in Dahanayake and Others v. Sri Lanka Insurance

Corporation Ltd. and Others4 wherein this Court held that,

if there is no full and truthful disclosure of all material facts, the

Court would not go into the merits of the Application but will

dismiss it without further examination.

The Petitioner in the immediate matter breached this principle by

supressing material facts concerning the invocation of the alternative

remedy under Section 86 of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 and

its pending nature to this Court. Whereby, I find that the Petitioner

through such suppression of material facts have attempted to pollute

the pure stream of justice.

For the foregoing reasons, I uphold the preliminary objections raised

and dismiss the Application. Thus, the Application is dismissed. No

costs.

Application dismissed.
