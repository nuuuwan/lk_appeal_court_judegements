B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Petitioners are contract-based employees of the National Water Supply and

Drainage Board (1st Respondent) who are seeking this Courts intervention to grant and

issue a Writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, 9th, 10th,12th,13th and 14th

Respondents to confirm their services in accordance with Public Administration Circulars

Nos. 25/2014 (P3), 25/2014(I) (P4) and 29/2019 (P17) dated 12th November 2014, 29th

December 2014 and 18th September 2019, respectively.

The sole grievance of the Petitioners is that their legitimate expectation of being

absorbed into the permanent cadre of the Respondent Board, in terms of the aforesaid

Public Administration Circulars, has been frustrated. As a result, it is averred that the

failure or refusal of the Respondent authorities to do so is unlawful.

A brief exposition of the doctrine of legitimate expectations, the key ground on

which this Court is invited to review this apparent unlawful decision must be set out prior

to delving into the merits.

13

The doctrine of legitimate expectations is relatively a newcomer in the armoury

of judicial review. In English administrative law, this doctrine was first enunciated by

Lord Denning in the year 1969, in the case of Schmidt v. Secretary of State for Home

Affairs [1969] 2 Ch 149 thus:

The speeches in Ridge v Baldwin show that an administrative body, may in a proper case,

be bound to give a person who is affected by their decision an opportunity of making

representations. It all depends on whether the person has some right or interest, or, I would add,

some legitimate expectation of which it would not be fair to deprive him without hearing what he

has to say. [emphasis added]

The doctrine of legitimate expectations, to use the words of Professor Paul Craig

in his treatise, Administrative Law (9th Edition at p. 728), is predicated on a range of

values, such as equitable notions of fairness; rule of law principles such as the need to

protect against the abuse of power; legal certainty; and protection of the citizens trust in

the administrative system. In their monumental tome, Administrative Law (11th Edition

at p. 450) Sir H.W.R. Wade & Professor C.F. Forsyth observe:

Where some boon or benefit has been promised by an official that boon or benefit may be

legitimately expected by those who have placed their trust in the promises of the official. It would

be unfair to dash those expectations without at least granting the person affected an opportunity

to show the official why his discretion should be exercised in a way that fulfils his expectation.

Lord Diplock in the landmark judgment of Council of Civil Service Unions v.

Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374 (the GCHQ Case) noted that it is preferable

to refer to such expectations as legitimate instead of reasonable so as to indicate that

the former has consequences to which effect will be given in public law. His Lordship

observed legitimate expectations arise when decisions affect a person:

by depriving him of some benefit or advantage which either (i) he had in the past been

permitted by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately expect to be permitted to

continue to do until there has been communicated to him some rational grounds for withdrawing

it on which he has been given an opportunity to comment; or (ii)he has received assurance from

the decision-maker will not be withdrawn without giving him first an opportunity of advancing

reasons for contending that they should not be withdrawn.

The doctrine of legitimate expectations, in its formative years, was given protection

only if the expectation was categorised as a procedural legitimate expectation. That is an

expectation that denotes the existence of some process right the applicant claims to

14

possess as a result of a promise or behaviour by the public body that generates the

expectation (Craig, supra at p. 727). In contrast, Substantive legitimate expectations or

expectations that a particular or favourable decision by the authority would occur were

considered beyond the bounds of judicial competence and authority (Wade & Forsyth,

supra at p. 460) and thus not protected for reasons such as the fettering of a public

authoritys statutorily conferred discretion and autonomy. Unwilling to be tied down by

tradition and a refusal to discriminate between procedural and substantive legitimate

expectations, the landmark judgment of the Court of Appeal in R v. North & East Devon

Health Authority ex p. Coughlan [2000] 3 AER 850, settled beyond doubt that substantive

legitimate expectations are now equally protected. We are reminded of the words of an

eminent judge and jurist Justice C.G. Weeramantry, as his Lordship wrote in An

invitation to the Law (at p. 218), if judges are dominated by the common law attitude of

conformity rather than by attitude of innovation which characterised equity in its great

formative stage, judicial decision making can lose some of its thrust.

Having analysed the English law position, his Lordship Prasanna Jayawardena J.

in Ariyarathne & Others v. Illangakoon & Others (SC FR Application No. 444/2012 SC

Minutes 30.07.2019) provided a comprehensive exposition of the doctrine of legitimate

expectations in our legal system. As amply demonstrated in our extensive writ and

fundamental rights jurisprudence, the doctrine of legitimate expectations is much in

vogue.

In order to protect or enforce this legally protected expectation (Professor

Timothy Endicott, Administrative Law 5th Edition at p. 313), which the law gives some

form of protection in judicial review, a Court must first be satisfied as to the legitimacy

of the expectation, and second, it must be satisfied that there is no overriding or

countervailing consideration that will frustrate the expectation. The legitimacy of an

expectation largely depends upon the nature of the representation on which the claimant

relies. A legitimate expectation, set out in case law, stems from a clear, unequivocal, and

unambiguous representation by the relevant authority in the nature of either a promise,

practice, or policy. In addition, such representation must not be ultra vires; it must not

conflict with statutes, and the claimant should not have foreseen that the expectation was

likely to be frustrated. If there was sufficient and adequate notice of the change in the

status quo it would not amount to a legitimate expectation.

15

Secondly, if an expectation is deemed to be legitimate there are three approaches,

as set out in Coughlan (supra) which a Court is faced with. The first is to determine

whether the expectation was only a mandatory relevant consideration. If the expectation

is categorised as such, the Court may either judge whether the expectation has been

considered at all as a relevant consideration, and if it has not been so considered at all,

quash the decision to resile from the expectation for want of taking into account a relevant

consideration. If the expectation has been considered, but if it appears to Court that the

failure to enforce the expectation, in the circumstances of the case, was so unreasonable

(in the Wednesbury unreasonable sense) the decision to resile from the expectation can

be quashed. The second, exclusively dealing with procedural legitimate expectations, the

Court would require that represented process be carried out, provided the expectation is

not outweighed by an overriding reason. Third, dealing exclusively with substantive

legitimate expectations, the Court must determine whether the frustration of the

expectation was so unfair that it was tantamount to an abuse of power. Inherent in this

approach as well is the task of weighing the claimants expectation against the overriding

reason submitted by the authority for its change in direction. These three approaches as

described in the case of Coughlan (supra) are thus:

(a) The court may decide that the public authority is only required to bear in mind its

previous policy or other representation, giving it the weight, it thinks right, but no more, before

deciding whether to change course. Here the court is confined to reviewing the decision on

Wednesbury grounds.

(b) the court may decide that the promise or practice induces a legitimate expectation of,

for example, being consulted before a particular decision is taken. Here it is uncontentious that the

court itself will require the opportunity for consultation to be given unless there is an overriding

reason to resile from it. In which case the court will itself judge the adequacy of the reason

advanced for the change of policy, taking into account what fairness requires.

(c) Where the court considers that a lawful promise or practice has induced a legitimate

expectation of a benefit which is substantive, not simply procedural, authority now establishes that

here too the court will in a proper case decide whether to frustrate the expectation is so unfair that

to take a new and different course will amount to an abuse of power. Here, once the legitimacy of

the expectation is established, the court will have the task of weighing the requirements of fairness

against any overriding interest relied upon for the change of policy. [emphasis added]

16

The Coughlan standards of review have been adopted in our jurisprudence. For

instance, his Lordship Arjuna Obeyesekere J. in Captain (Temporary) H.D.C. Perera v.

Lt. Gen N.U.M.M.W. Senanayake & Ors (CA Wrt 408/2018 CA Minutes 31.08.2020)

studied the application of these standards. Similarly, his Lordship Janak De Silva J. in

Galle Municipal Council v. Galle Festival (Guarantee) Limited (CA (PHC) No. 155/2010

CA Minutes 01.03.2019) discussed the applicability of Coughlans third standard of review

in our law.

Bearing this in mind, we must now determine whether the Petitioners in the

instant application will overcome these obstacles.

In the instant case, some Petitioners have completed more than 3 years of service

at the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, whilst others have completed more

than 23 years of service.

As alluded to above, the representation that the Petitioners are relying on is the

circulars; Public Administration Circulars Nos. 25/2014 (P3), 25/2014(I) (P4) and

29/2019 (P17) dated 12th November 2014, 29th December 2014 and 18th September 2019,

respectively, issued to all Secretaries of Ministries, Heads of Departments and Heads of

all State Corporations and Statutory Boards. As stated in the body of the circulars, the

same has been issued with the concurrence of the Treasury. This was pointed out by the

Petitioners to dispel the notion that their absorption into the permanent cadre would not

burden the countrys finances. Further, the first two circulars state that contract,

substitute, daily, and temporary employees can be made permanent provided they have

satisfied certain conditions such as the completion to the satisfaction of the employer

continuous 180 days of service, and minimum educational qualifications depending on the

grade/post of the relevant employees. P4 (at para. 5) includes temporary, contract

employees who are serving in foreign-funded projects as well.

However, Public Administration Circulars Nos. 25/2014 (P3), 25/2014(I) (P4)

were revoked by Public Administration Circular No. 25/2014(II) dated 4th April 2016

(P16). The said Circular communicated the decision of the Cabinet dated 23rd February

2016 to revoke the previous two Circulars in a manner that would not cause any prejudice

to those employees who would have been made permanent under those Circulars. The

relevant paragraph reads:

17

l%shdud.hlg fofha

2016.02.23 .

On the 18th of September 2019, Circular P16 was rescinded by Circular 29/2019

(P17), which reinstated Circulars P3 and P4. The circular too depicts that it was

issued with the concurrence of the Treasury. The relevant portion reads:

02. 25/2014 25/2014 (i ) imqK

2019.09.01 imqK i

ii 25/2014 25/2014 (i)

2019.09.17 .

i.

imqK imqK

.

ii. i imqK

.

Ex facie, these circulars would give any reasonable person a legitimate expectation to

be made permanent. If these Circulars are in fact applicable to the employees of the 1st

Respondent, it is rather unequivocal that those employees satisfying the minimum

criteria therein might expect to be absorbed as permanent cadre.

Notwithstanding the issue of whether the circular has statutory force (for instance,

see Basnayake v. Secretary of the Treasury [2006] 2 SLR 9), as Dr. Sunil Coorey in his

influential, Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka (4th Edition - Volume 1 at p.

458) notes:

Circulars, instructions and rules, issued by State officials for the guidance of themselves or

their subordinates, not under any empowering statutory provisions and therefore not enforceable

as law, but laying down criteria on which they would act in different types of cases, will create

the legitimate expectation in the minds of the general public that those circulars would be adhered

to in individual cases.

18

Despite the finding of a legitimate expectation, that expectation in order to be legally

enforceable must withstand any countervailing consideration that is thrown at it.

It must also be noted that subsequent to these Circulars, recruitment and filling

vacancies was regulated by Circulars of the Ministry of Finance such as DMS/Cir/2020

dated 21st February 2020 (1R4), which is alluded to in DMS/Cir/2020 dated 26th October

2020 (1R5).

Nonetheless, we are of the view that the standard of protection this expectation would

garner is that of the first standard set out in the aforesaid Coughlan test. That is, these

expectations would only amount to a mandatory relevant consideration on the part of the

authorities. There is evidence to suggest that the authorities had considered it, as set out

in paragraph 16 of their statement of objections. Although, the circulars were issued in

2014 and 2019, and with the concurrence of the Treasury, given the present economic

predicament of the country we cannot, regrettably, in the absence of any material

demonstrating the continuity of the Treasurys concurrence, insist the implementation of

the circulars. This is also due to the subsequent circulars that have suspended and/or

regulated recruitment to the public service.

We are of the view that it is a vital consideration that we cannot ignore and that it

deals with a polycentric question involving finite resources. It is with situations such as

the present in mind that Lord Laws observed in R v. Department of Education and

Employment, ex p Begbie [2000] 1 WLR 1115, that the first and third categories are not

hermetically sealed. We cannot, as the learned Judge said, don the garb of a policy

maker. His Lordship Arjuna Obeyesekere J. in Captain (Temporary) H.D.C. Perera v. Lt.

Gen N.U.M.M.W. Senanayake & Ors (supra) observed:

This is especially so in relation to the first and third categories, where a policy decision,

as stated in the first category may have the effect of depriving a previously promised substantial

benefit, as envisaged by the third category.

In addition, the Petitioners contend that by the conduct of the Respondent

authorities, such as by treating them as similar to permanent employees, whenever a

project came to an end, assigning them to a new project would give rise to a legitimate

expectation that they would be made permanent. However, we are unable to agree with

this contention since in these circumstances we are not satisfied that a legitimate

expectation can be generated. As noted above, there must be a clear, unequivocal, and

unambiguous representation from the relevant authority, in this case, the relevant

19

Respondent authorities which gives rise to such an expectation. In the instant case,

factors such as them being paid the same as permanent employees or assigned duties in

the Water Board as done for permanent employees have not crystallised into the standard

expected by law for the expectation to be legally protected, in the absence of a clear

promise or practice. Their contracts of employment made it clear that they were hired on

a temporary basis for the duration of their contract.

Further, the Respondent Board notes that the Petitioners have been recruited

after the completion of a project to other projects for the duration of those projects.

However, it maintains the position that the Petitioners were always employed on a

contract basis. This is not uncommon or a strange occurrence. Firstly, the term project

itself denotes a collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned to achieve a particular

aim. This means one cannot expect a project to continue in perpetuity. (In terms of the

Management Services Circular No 01/2019 (1R8), issued by the Ministry of Finance, a

project was defined as a planned set of interrelated tasks to be executed over a fixed

period of time and within certain costs and other limitations to achieve a particular

objective/s. Secondly, hiring employees on a contractual basis for various projects is well

within reason. If a person is hired for a particular project, and such persons performance

is satisfactory to the employer, the employer would prefer to keep such person until the

life of that project terminates, and if there are opportunities where such employees

services can be made use of in another project, any prudent employer would prefer that

employee for the job. In a scenario where the employee, such as in the present case, has

served the relevant authority during the life of a project and seen it to completion, we do

not think it is reasonable for the employee to compel the employer to hire the employee

for some other project if there are no projects or if there are no vacancies in ongoing

projects. Perhaps, there may be a moral obligation that a generous employer may render

in the form of an ex gratia payment or finding employment for the hard-working employee

elsewhere, but that would be at the discretion of each employer, and that remains purely

a moral consideration; that is a matter of conscience rather than a legal obligation.

In the latter circumstance in which the Petitioners claim a legitimate expectation

has arisen (i.e. their apparent treatment as permanent employees), if what had been

sought was fulfilment of an expectation of being considered in the pool of candidates for

the new recruitment or merely to be interviewed, instead of the expectation of being

recruited itself, the unenviable judicial task of balancing competing interests would have

been easier to perform and the scales may have tilted in favour of the Petitioners.

20

Related to this application, especially in the light of the sole prayer for a writ of

mandamus, is another question that arises for consideration.

The issuance of a writ of mandamus is based upon the satisfaction of certain

criteria that have been laid out in our case law. The clearest of such an enumeration of

criteria is found in Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka v. Messrs Jafferjee and

Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd [2005] 1 SLR 89. His Lordship J.A.N. De Silva, J. (as he then was),

with their Lordships S.N. Silva C.J. and Weerasuriya J. agreeing, set out some of the

prerequisites for issuing a Writ of Mandamus:

There is rich and profuse case law on Mandamus on the conditions to be satisfied by the

Applicant. Some of the conditions precedent the issue of Mandamus appear to be:

(a) The Applicant must have a legal right to the performance of a legal duty by the parties against

whom the Mandamus is sought (R v Barnstaple Justices). The foundation of Mandamus is the

existence of a legal right (Napier Ex Parte)

(b) The right to be enforced must be a Public Right and the duty sought to be enforced must be of

a public nature.

(c) The legal right to compel must reside in the Applicant himself (R v Lewisham Union)

(d) The application must be made in good faith and not for an indirect purpose

(e) The application must be preceded by a distinct demand for the performance of the duty

(f) The person or body to whom the writ is directed must be subject to the jurisdiction of the court

issuing the writ

(g) The Court will as a general rule and in the exercise of its discretion refuse writ of Mandamus

when there is another special remedy available which is not less convenient, beneficial and

effective.

(h) The conduct of the Applicant may disentitle him to the remedy.

(i) It would not be issued if the writ would be futile in its result.

(j) Writ will not be issued where the Respondent has no power to perform the act sought to be

mandated.

The above principles governing the issue of a writ of Mandamus were also discussed at length in

P.K. Benarji v H.J. Simonds. Whether the facts show the existence of any or all pre-requisites to

the granting of the writ is a question of law in each case to be decided not in any rigid or technical

view of the question, but according to a sound and reasonable interpretation. The court will not

21

grant a Mandamus to enforce a right not of a legal but of a purely equitable nature however

extreme the inconvenience to which the applicant might be put.

A key criterion is the existence of a legal right, and correspondingly a legal duty,

similar to a Hohfeldian analysis of rights.

This has been the requirement in many cases. His Lordship Sharvananda J. (as

he then was) in Weligama Multi-Purpose Co-Operative Society v. Chandradasa

Daluwatta [1984] 1 SLR 195 held that Clause 7(1) of a particular circular issued by the

Secretary of the Co-operative Employees Commission which stated that an interdicted

employee was entitled to such payment pending the conclusion of his inquiry did not

impose an obligation to do so, and that such a direction could not be elevated to a

regulation having statutory efficacy. His Lordship held (at p. 199):

Mandamus lies to secure the performance of a public duty, in the performance of which

an applicant has sufficient legal interest. To be enforceable by Mandamus the duty to be performed

must be of a public nature and not of merely private character.. A public duty may be imposed by

either statute, charter or the common law or custom.-Short on Mandamus at page 228.

It is settled that where an entirely new right is given by statute. Mandamus is the remedy,

though it is otherwise where an old right only is enforced -Per Wood V.C. in Simpson v. Scottish

Union Insurance Company.

Today the chief function of the Writ is to compel the performance of a public duty prescribed

by statute, though it lies as well for the enforcement of common law public duty. Vide Ratnayake

v. Perera.

The Writ will not issue for private purpose, that is to say for the enforcement of a mere

private duty stemming from a contract or otherwise. Contractual duties are enforceable by the

ordinary contractual remedies such as damages, specific performance or injunction. They are not

enforceable by Mandamus which is confined to public duties and is not granted where there are

other adequate remedies.

This was cited with approval in the case of Hakmana Multi Purpose Co-operative

Society Ltd. v. Ferdinando [1985] 2 SLR 272 SC. The requisite of public or statutory duty

was discussed in the cases such as Piyasiri v. People's Bank [1989] 2 SLR 47; Sannasgala

v. University of Kelaniya [1991] 2 SLR 193 and Samaraweera v. Minister of Public

Administration [2003] 3 SLR 64.

His Lordship Amaratunga J. in Vasana v. Incorporated Council of Legal Education

[2004] 1 SLR 154 at p. 163 observed:

A writ of mandamus is available against a public or a statutory body performing statutory

duties of a public character. In order to succeed in an application for a writ of mandamus the

petitioner has to show that he or she has legal right and the respondent corporate, statutory or

public body has a legal duty to recognize and give effect to the petitioners legal right. In the instant

case the Council of Legal Education has decided to admit to the Law College in 2002 all those

candidates who have scored 70 marks and above at the Entrance Examination held in September

2001. The petitioner who has obtained only 56 marks at the said Examination has no legal right

to be admitted to the Law College on the results of the said Examination. Accordingly, there is no

corresponding legal duty on the Council of Legal Education to admit the petitioner to the Law

College.

A pertinent observation of his Lordship that is worth re-iterating is thus:

The most important principle to be observed in the exercise of jurisdiction by Mandamus

which lies at the very foundation of rules and principles regulating the use of this extra ordinary

remedy is based on the distinction between duties of mandatory nature and those which are

discretionary in character. The respondents having acted fairly, reasonably, and in accordance

with the principles of natural justice in affording an opportunity to the petitioner to examine her

answer script will not be compelled to admit the petitioner to Law College by this Court in the

exercise of its discretionary jurisdiction. In the result the petitioners application for a writ of

mandamus also fails.

Therefore, it appears trite that there must be a public/ statutory duty or legal duty

(not merely equitable duty/obligation), or evidence of the same, in order for a writ of

mandamus to be issued. The issue then is whether the doctrine of legitimate expectations

which is based on equity can generate a legal or statutory duty to compel the relevant

authority to keep to its representation and enforce the expectation.

It must be noted that the doctrine of legitimate expectations has been invoked in

the fundamental rights jurisdiction as well. This is what Dr. Jayampathy Wickremaratne

P.C. in his tome, Fundamental Rights in Sri Lanka (3rd edition at p. 565) refers to as the

constitutionalisation of administrative law. The learned author explains that

administrative law principles such as legitimate expectations, natural justice have been

relied on when determining violations of the equal protection clause and thus given rise

to constitutional remedies in addition to remedies in administrative law. He cites the

cases of Dayarathna v. Minister of Health [1999] 1 SLR 393, Chathurika Silva v. Sunil

23

Hettiarachchi and Chanima Wijebandara v. Sunil Hettiarachchi SC FR 228/2018 and SC

FR 229/2018 SCM 18.06.2020 as examples. In this regard, the fundamental rights

jurisdiction is not trammelled by the criteria for the issuance of mandamus; there is no

necessity therefore to demonstrate a right and a corresponding duty, unlike the writ

jurisdiction conferred on this Court by Article 140 of the Constitution, when granting a

writ of mandamus. It is then a distinction that must be borne in mind when analysing the

legitimate expectations jurisprudence since it is a distinction that is capable of being

overlooked.

Most recently, her Ladyship Murdu Fernando P.C. J. recognised this subtle

distinction in Dayanthi Dias Kaluarachchi v. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation SC Appeal

43/2013 SCM 19.06.2019 :

I re-iterate the observations of JAN de Silva J., quoted above that the foundation of

mandamus is the existence of a legal right. A court should not grant a writ of mandamus to enforce

a right which is not legal and not based upon a public duty. Judicial intervention based upon

legitimate expectation should not be used as a tool for enforcing a right purely of an equitable

nature.

The question we are grappling with is whether the criterion of mandamus should

be sacrificed on the altar of legitimate expectations. Whether a legitimate expectation,

such as in the present case, can be enforced through a writ of mandamus is doubtful. This

is an issue that merits further consideration.

For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the petition, without costs.
