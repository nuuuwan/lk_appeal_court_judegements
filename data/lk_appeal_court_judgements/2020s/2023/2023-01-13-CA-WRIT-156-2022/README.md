Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner in the instant Application claims that the Petitioner is entitled to invoke the

writ jurisdiction of this Court in order to get the importation documents relating to the

vehicle imported by the Petitioner in 2017 released. The Petitioner seeks such relief based

on the assessed excise duty already paid by the Petitioner for the importation of the said

vehicle and without any increased excise duty. According to the Petitioner the said vehicle

which is a Mercedes Benz Elegance Hearse (Hearse) was a used vehicle with an engine

capacity of 2,685 cc and the Petitioner has purchased the said Hearse for the purpose of

importing the same to Sri Lanka under HS Code No. 87.03.23.40.

The Department of Imports and Exports Control issued a license on 26.07.2017 (P3) for

the importation of the said Hearse and a Letter of Credit has been opened on 17.08.2017.

The Petitioners contention is that, at the time of opening of the aforesaid Letter of Credit,

the excise duty levied for the importation of motor vehicles including Hearses was

governed by the provisions of the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1992/29 dated 10.11.2016

(P5) and accordingly, the excise duty payable, inter alia, for Hearses imported by

Registered Funeral Undertakers at the rate of 50% of the value with the approval of the

Page 3 of 10

Ministry of Finance as set out in item 4 of Schedule II thereof. The Petitioner, based on

the tax regime applicable at the time of opening the aforesaid Letter of Credit claims that

the Petitioner had a legitimate expectation that the excise duty payable on the importation

of the said Hearse would be a sum of Rs.1.8 Million. The said Hearse was shipped on

board in the United Kingdom on 29.10.2017 and arrived in Sri Lanka on 16.11.2017.

After opening the Letter of Credit, the Petitioner has applied to the Department of Fiscal

Policy for a duty rebate to be granted as applicable for the import of a used Hearse and the

said Department accordingly, granted approval for concessionary excise duty in terms of

the said item 4 of Schedule II of the Gazette Notification P5 by way of the document

dated 22.11.2017 (P7). Consequently, Sri Lanka Customs (Customs) issued a Notice of

Assessment dated 27.11.2017 (P9) assessing the excise duty payable for the importation

of the said Hearse at Rs.1,806,401.00. The Petitioner settled the said amount on

29.11.2017.

The Petitioners complaint is that even after the payment of the excise duty pertaining to

the importation of the said Hearse, the 2nd Respondent arbitrarily prevented the release of

the vehicle on account of a budget revision. Apparently, the said Gazette Notification,

marked P5 under which the excise duty for the said Hearse was calculated, has been

rescinded by the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2044/32 dated 09.11.2017 (P10) and

thereby, the computation of excise duty has been revised. In the meantime, another

Gazette Notification (P11) has been published on 28.11.2017 to grant certain reliefs by

way of revising and staying the applicability of the Gazette Notification P10 to several

classes of vehicles where Letters of Credit have been opened prior to 09.11.2017.

Additionally, the Government Gazette Extraordinary No. 2117/48 dated 04.04.2019

(P14) was also issued revising and staying the applicability of P10.

However, the subject vehicle has not been taken into the category of vehicles described in

P11 & P14. Accordingly, the Petitioner was informed to pay an additional excise duty

amounting to a sum of Rs.6,300,000.00 in order to get the Hearse released.

The Petitioner asserts that it was not served with a revised Notice of Assessment for the

enhanced excise duty and the enhanced assessment was only an internal note on the

reverse of the letter dated 19.02.2018 (P12(d)(1)) sent by the Petitioner to the Director

General of Customs. In a subsequent development, the Hearse has been released to the

Page 4 of 10

Petitioner upon submission of a Bank Guarantee for the value of Rs.6,300,000.00.

However, the Customs retained the Petitioners import documents such as Letter of

Credit, Import Control License etc., which are essential for the registration of the said

vehicle.

The Petitioner pleads that the Petitioner has been unfairly and unjustly excluded from the

reliefs granted by the Gazette Notifications, marked P11 & P14, and the Petitioner was

gravely prejudice by such Gazette Notifications. The Petitioner made several

representations to the Ministry of Finance and to Sri Lanka Customs and such

communications between the Petitioner and the relevant authorities are annexed to the

Petition marked as P15a to P15c and P16 to P23. The stand taken by the Respondents

in those communications is that the date of importation shall be the date of delivery and

no duty relief can be accommodated in respect of the Hearse within the existing legal

provisions.

The effect of Section 3 of Act No. 1 of 2006

The Respondents heavily rely on the provisions of Section 3 of the Protection of

Government Revenue (Special Provisions) Act No. 1 of 2006. The said Section 3;

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any of the laws specified

in Part II of the Schedule hereto, for the purpose of levying or charging any tax,

duty, surcharge, levy or other charge on the importation or exportation of goods

into or from Sri Lanka, the date of importation or exportation, as the case may be,

shall be the date of delivery to the Director-General of Customs, of the bill of entry

relating to the goods on which such tax, duty, surcharge, levy or other charge is

levied or charged.

If this matter is dealt only with a narrow interpretation of the said Section, the Petitioner

may be levied charges based on the provisions of the Gazette Notification, marked P10,

as it has been issued on 09.11.2017, prior to the delivery of the subject vehicle. It is a

standard norm that the orders or regulations promulgated under certain Statues should not

be violative of any other law prescribed by an Act of Parliament unless the Legislature

itself has made provisions to that effect. The Petitioner argues that granting concessions to

several other importers by the orders prescribed in the Gazette Notifications, marked P11

and P14 itself amounts to a violation of the provisions of the said Act No. 1 of 2006. The

Page 5 of 10

ground for such argument is that the Gazette Notification P11 by which certain

concessions have been granted specifies the date of applicability for the imposition of

excise duty as being based on the time of the opening of the Letter of Credit. An excise

duty thereof will be calculated as per the rescinded Gazette Notification, marked P5 and

not on the date of submission of the bill of entry. Similarly, the Gazette Notification,

marked P14, specifies the applicability of special duty being the rate of excise duty

applicable at the time of opening of the respective Letters of Credit and not on the date of

the submission of the bill of entry. Thus, a reasonable question arises as to whether the

subsequent Gazette Notifications P11 and P14 are lawful. However, this Court is not

invited to consider such question in the instant Application.

Petitioners legitimate expectation

Another foremost claim is that the Petitioner had a legitimate expectation that the

prejudice caused to the Petitioner would have been rectified by way of a subsequent

Gazette Notification as several persons who imported certain other categories of vehicles

during the same time have been accorded with concessions to overcome the effect of P10.

In response to the arguments formulated by the Petitioner on its legitimate expectation,

the Respondents referring to the judgement in Ranasinghe Bandara vs. Director District

Land Reform Commission and others, CA/Writ/233/2017 decided on 17.06.2019 asserts that

there cannot be any legitimate expectation created by an ultra vires representation.

Anyhow, the Petitioner cited several judgements in order to establish the fact that when

there is a change in policy an opportunity should be accorded for a reasonable remedy for

the parties whose legitimate expectation was frustrated.

In Dayaratne and others vs. Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine and others (1999) 1

Sri. L.R. 393;

When a change of policy is likely to frustrate the legitimate expectation of individuals,

they must be given an opportunity of stating why the change of policy should not affect them

unfavourably. Such procedural rights have an important bearing on the protection afforded

by Article 12 of the Constitution against unequal treatment, arbitrarily, invidiously,

irrationally or otherwise unreasonably dealt out by the executive.'

Page 6 of 10

But it is also well-established that it is a misuse of power for (a public body) to act unfairly

or unjustly towards the private citizen when there is no overriding public interest to warrant

it

there is a substantive requirement that there must be an overriding public interest if a

change of policy were to set at nought an individual's prior expectation

The Supreme Court in Ratnakumara and others vs. Postgraduate Institute of Medicine SC

Appeal 16/2014, SC minutes 30.03.2016 (this case has been referred to even in Dr. Chanaka

Harsha Talpahewa vs. Mr. Prasad Kariyawasam, Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

and others, SC/FR Application No. 378/2017 decided on 21.06.2022) considered the

immediate change of a regulation without giving adequate prior notice as follows;

any person who commences an act under a particular Regulation has an expectation

to finish the same under the same terms and conditions stated in the said Regulations. Thus,

it gives rise to a legitimate expectation for such persons to complete their actions under the

same terms and conditions.

Reasonable criteria

Other than the assertions on the legitimate expectation, the salient feature that needs to be

taken into consideration is assessing the Notice of Assessment (P9) based on the

provisions of P5 by Customs despite the fact that the Hearse arrived in Sri Lanka after

issuing the Gazette Notification P10. The contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor

General who appears for the Respondents is that the duty rebate sought by the Petitioner

has been considered based on the Gazette Notification, marked P5 and anyhow, it has

been done inadvertently without referring to the revised excise duty reflected in the

Gazette Notification P10. It is stated that the said Notice of Assessment (P9) has been

issued under the excise duties described in P5 owing to a failure on the part of the

Customs to update the particular computerized system to include the new excise duty rates

during the time the Customs issued the said Notice of Assessment to the Petitioner.

Now I need to examine whether the Respondents have adopted a reasonable criteria after

committing a purported error or mistake in respect of the said Notice of Assessment upon

which the total amount therein has been paid by the Petitioner and also whether the claims

Page 7 of 10

on legitimate expectation of the Petitioner outweigh the provisions of Section 3 of the said

Act No. 1 of 2006.

It is important to note that the Customs has accepted the payment of Rs.1,806,401.00 on

29.11.2017 from the Petitioner and nowhere in the subsequent communications the

relevant officials have categorically informed the Petitioner that they had made a mistake

or an error in calculating the excise duty based on a wrong Gazette Notification. Instead,

the relevant authorities continuously responded to the Petitioners requests for relief

stating that the rate of excise duty applicable on the Hearse was the rate prevailed at the

time of submission of bill of entry and those are the rates described in the Gazette

Notification P10 and not in P5 upon which the Notice of Assessment (P9) has been

made. All the requests made by the Petitioner for a concession similar to what was given

to certain categories in P11 and P14 were turned down by officials on the basis that such

relief cannot be afforded within the existing legal regime in reference to the importation of

the Hearse.

In terms of the said Section 3 of the Act No. 1 of 2006, the date of importation or

exportation for the purpose of levying any tax or duty shall be the date of delivery of the

bill of entry relating to the relevant goods. There is no issue in the instant Application on

the date of the bill of entry as the Petitioner has clearly declared in Custom - Goods

Declaration, marked P8, that the vessel has arrived at the Port of Colombo on

16.11.2017. Thus, what needs consideration at this stage is whether overcharging the

Petitioner is rational at a time where the transactions have been completed by settling the

tax/duty upon the Notice of Assessment P9.

If there is an obvious error in calculating charges, I am of the view that the relevant

authorities can adopt a suitable criteria to rectify such error/mistake. It needs to be

inquired as to whether any evidence has been tendered to Court by the Respondents to

show that there was a mistake. Only in oral and written submissions made on behalf of

Respondents, it was admitted that the issuance of the Notice of Assessment based on P5

was a mistake. Even the endorsement made by the Deputy Director of Customs (DDC)

reflected in P12(d)(1) does not refer to any mistake/error, but it illustrates only the fact

that the computerized system has not been modified after issuing P10. The said DDC

has stated therein;

Page 8 of 10

However, the system has not been modified to collect taxes based on Engine Capacity for

Hearses. This new tax system came into effect after 2018 budget.

Having observed that the computerized system has not been updated with the new tax

regime, the said DDC without any further clarification has arrived at the following

conclusion;

According to new X1D Gazette Rupees 8,005,000.00 should have been paid for this Hearse

but as per 4000-XH1 code only 1,789,094.00 has been recovered for this Cusdec

It appears that the DDC has completely ignored the fact that the computer system had not

been updated for period of 11 days starting from 09.11.2017 (the date of P10) up to the

date of the Notice of Assessment (P9) i.e., 27.11.2017. Do the Respondents expect this

Court to believe that the Customs has not updated their computer system after publishing

P10 for 11 days and if so, what was the criteria and procedure adopted by the Customs

for the goods imported during that period? Hasnt the Customs cleared any goods other

than the Hearse imported during the said period? Anyhow there is no evidence before

Court as to how long exactly the said system was functioning without the revised data

being updated. Moreover, the Petitioner speaks not about 11 days but about a period of 3

weeks within which the said system has not been updated. To my mind, it is impossible to

justify even a single day without an updated computerized system at the Customs which

is vital for the process of levying tax/duty in respect of imported goods.

It is observed that none of the communications addressed to the Petitioner by the relevant

officials stipulate that the Customs has made a mistake and there had been a necessity to

rectify such error. Certain provisions are available in the Interpretation Ordinance also to

amend, vary, rescind or to revoke orders by the authority who made the same orders. If a

public officer or a public institution makes a mistake, procedures are in place which enable

them to rectify such mistakes according to law. Not issuing a revised Notice of Assessment

up to date itself emphasizes that the Customs has not followed any reasonable criteria in

order to overcome any purported repercussions of not updating the computerized system.

Rights of the Petitioner

In light of the above, it is important to examine whether the rights of the Petitioner can be

undermined by clinging only to the provisions of the said Section 3 of the Act No. 1 of

2006 when the subsequent Gazette Notifications P11 and P14 are silent on the class or

Page 9 of 10

category of vehicles such as the Hearse. The Petitioner contends that despite the fact that

all excise duty assessed by the Customs have been paid, the import documentation in

relation to the Hearse have been retained by the Customs unfairly and unjustly. The

Petitioner further pleads that the failure to include the category of vehicle imported by the

Petitioner in the Gazette Notifications marked P11 and P14 which granted relief only

to a certain category of persons caused grave prejudice and unfairness to the Petitioner.

It needs to be stressed that the Petitioner should not get any undue advantage due to any

reasonable mistake of the Customs. But I cannot avoid any contrary conclusion if the

rights of the Petitioner are affected due to the irrational conduct of the Respondents. For

the reasons set out above and also based on the circumstances of this case, it can be

assumed ex-facie that the Petitioners rights have been affected due to the conduct of the

Customs and the Department of Fiscal Policy as discussed above. This prompts me to be

wide-awake upon the contention of the Petitioner that there is no provision in law for the

Customs to release an imported motor vehicle on a bank guarantee with a condition of

retaining all relevant documents which prevents the Petitioner from registering the Hearse

with the Department of Motor Traffic.

By looking at the issues from a different angle, the Customs cannot, in terms of the

principles of Rule of Law, accord preferential treatment or special privileges to the

Petitioner by delaying the issuance of a revised notice of assessment or not following a

reasonable criterion to rectify promptly any error made by them. Since 2017 the Customs

has been failed to follow a reasonable and non-discriminatory criterion to recover any

additional duty/taxes, if any, from the Petitioner. An act of merely responding to the

letters of the Petitioner stating that an additional tax/duty should be recovered based on

the date of the bill of entry cannot be regarded as an appropriate criterion.

If a scheme or criterion adopted to recover additional duty/taxes are prima facie

unreasonable and irrational or discriminatory because they are not based on a criteria

having a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, then the party whose rights

were affected due to such scheme or criteria will be entitled to discretionary remedy of this

Review Court. Sisira De Abrew J. in Sri Lanka Telecom Ltd. vs. Human Rights Commission

of Sri Lanka and others, SC Appeal No. 215/12 decided on 01.03.2017 considering several

legal literature, held that if a recommendation of a Public Body affects the right of an

Page 10 of 10

individual, Superior Courts, in the exercise of their writ jurisdiction, have the power to

quash such a recommendation by issuing a writ of Certiorari.

Conclusion

Judicial control over public power has been expanded through judicial activism. The

process of considering Rights as an independent ground of review has been recognized

by our Courts since the Supreme Court made pronouncements in the judgement of Perera

vs. Prof. Daya Edirisinghe and others (1995) 1 Sri. L.R. 148. Even if this Court disregards

the submissions of the parties on legitimate expectation, my above findings in reference to

the Petitioner whose rights have been affected, are sufficient for the purpose of full and

proper adjudication of the instant Application. Thus, I do not make any determination on

the reliefs prayed for based on the alleged legitimate expectation. Anyhow, I am mindful

of the statement of Lord Woolf MR in R vs. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex p.

Coughlan (2000) 3 All E.R. 850 (at p.872), where he has stated that Once the legitimacy of

the expectation is established, the court will have the task of weighing the requirements of

fairness against any overriding interest relied upon for the changing policy. It is true that

the governments are free to change policy, however, in certain circumstances the Review

Courts have tended to uphold the expectation generated by the old policy.

In the circumstances, I proceed to issue writs as prayed for in paragraphs (b), (e)(i) and (f)

of the prayer of the amended Petition dated 08.08.2022 of the Petitioner.
