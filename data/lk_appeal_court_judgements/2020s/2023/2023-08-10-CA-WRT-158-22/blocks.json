Hence, at this stage what needs consideration is whether the total period of service of the 3rd Respondent should be taken into consideration for gratuity benefits under the Payment of Gratuity Act despite that the Petitioner has entered into several contracts with the 3rd Respondent with insignificant gaps in between. However, the mere fact that there exist gaps between the fixed-term contracts does not necessarily mean that there was a termination of employment or an interrupted service every time the fixed-term contract ended due to effluxion of time. I am of the view that if such gap is not too long, if the employee is offered a new contract on the same terms and conditions as the previous contract and if the employee accepts the new contract, a gap in between one fixed term contract ending and another starting will not necessarily break continuity. When the circumstances of the instant scenario are taken into consideration, it appears that the breaks in between the fixed-term contracts i.e. approximately one-month in between, in subject are insignificant and the Further, it is observed that the terms and conditions of the fixed-term contracts in subject are identical to each other and the 3rd Respondent has effectively accepted the fixed-term contracts in subject. As such, it is apparent that the work done by the employee in question was of a continuous nature.",

This Court was of the view that it is significant to obtain a clarification from the parties in respect of the nature of the contracts of employment entered into between the Petitioner and the 118 other employees whose names are scheduled in Schedule 4 of P2. Despite such an undertaking, the parties have failed to follow through on the said commitment. It would have been easier to determine the nature of the 3rd Respondent's employment with the Petitioner if clarification had been provided. However, no reasonable grounds have been submitted to the court to differentiate the 3rd Respondent from the whole bulk of employees who have been absorbed into the Petitioner company.",
