Prasantha De Silva J.,

Judgment

The Complainant Party of the First Part, R. J. Siriweera and K. J. Siriweera had filed an

information by way of a Plaint on 18.03.2002 in terms of Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary

Court Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 at the Primary Court of Kaduwela in the Case bearing

No. 72717 against the Respondent Party of the Second Part namely, Dinesh Liyanage and

Others.

After supporting the Application, the learned Magistrate issued an Interim Order against the

Respondents and issued notice to the 1st to 17th Respondents.

The genesis of this matter relates to a dispute over a land which is two perches in extent,

where there was a well existing till 1999 which was abandoned. Thereafter, t remained a

bare land.

The said land, two perches in extent was created by virtue of a sub-division and blocking out

of a larger estate called Mount Leo Estate.

The learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge inquired into the matter

and dismissed the case of the Complaint Party of the First Part and dissolved the Interim

Order.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Complainant Party of the First Part Petitioners had

invoked the Revisionary Jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Western Province holden

in Colombo in Case bearing No. HCRA 225/2005.

Written Submissions filed on 24/01/2023 and 02.05.2023 by the 1st

and 2nd Respondent Party of the Second Part Respondent-Respondents

Delivered on: 31.08.2023

Page 9 of 10

After the filing of the objections by the Party of the Second Party Respondents, both parties

filed their respective Written Submissions and thereafter the learned Provincial High Court

Judge delivered the Order on 14.10.2015 upholding the Order of the learned Magistrate and

dismissing the Revision Application of the Complainant of the First Part-Petitioner.

Consequently, the Complainant of the First Part Petitioner-Appellant [hereinafter referred to

as the Appellants] had preferred an Appeal to the Court of Appeal seeking to set aside the

Order made by the learned Provincial High Court Judge dated 14.10.2005 and the Order of

the learned Primary Court Judge dated 27.08.2002.

It is noteworthy that the learned High Court Judge in his Order analysed and evaluated the

evidence placed before the learned Magistrate and had come to the findings that the two

perch land in question had been possessed and used in common by all parties. Thus, the

Appellant had not been in exclusive possession of the land in question. Furthermore, the

Appellants have not possessed it to the exclusion of the others, and nor have they derived any

right in terms of section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

The learned Provincial High Court Judge has essentially confirmed the reasoning of the

learned Magistrate and affirmed the Order, which concluded that all parties are entitled to

common possession of the two perch disputed land until the matter is decided by a competent

court.

Hence, if the Appellants have the legal right to claim the two perch land, the Appellants

should have instituted action in a Civil Court to determine their rights, nevertheless, they

have not taken any interest in civil litigation. Thus, it can be presumed that the Appellants

are trying to grab the portion of land in dispute to their land which is 18.8 perches in extent.,

making use of the provisions of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

It is significant to note that the Appellant had not shown any injustice being caused to them

by the Order of the learned Magistrate nor did any miscarriage of justice occur for the

Appellants to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Colombo

against the Order of the learned Magistrate.

In view of the aforesaid reasons, I hold that the learned Provincial High Court Judge has very

correctly affirmed the Order of the learned Magistrate and dismissed the revision application

of the party of the First Part Petitioner-Petitioner(Appellants).Therefore, we see no reason to

interfere with the Order of the learned Provincial High Court Judge dated 14.10.2005 and

the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 27.08.2007.

Hence, the appeal is dismissed with tax costs.

Appeal dismissed.

I agree.
