*****************************

JUDGMENT

The Petitioner had applied for bail on behalf of the suspect in the High

Court of Negombo in the case bearing No. Bail 137/2022. After an

inquiry, the Learned High Court Judge had refused bail on 12.08. 2022.

Aggrieved by the said order, the Petitioner had filed this Revision

Application to revise the said order. The Petitioner is the wife of the

suspect.

On 02.11.2022, upon receiving an information, the suspect was

arrested by officers attached to the Anti-Corruption Unit of Colombo

who were on petrol duty at Pamunugama Police area and recovered a

parcel from his trouser pocket. The parcel contained some substances

which reacted for Heroin (Diacetylmorphine). The substance weighed

about 43.200 grams.

The suspect was produced and facts were reported to the Welisara

Magistrate under Section 54A (1) (a) and (b) and of the Poisons, Opium

and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984

and a detention order was obtained for further investigations under

Section 82(3) of the said Act.

The production had been sent to the Government Analyst Department

on 17/11/2021. After analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded

the report to Court on 01/11/2022. According to the Government

Analyst, 27.34 grams of pure Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) had been

detected from the substance which was sent for the analysis.

Clarifying the name difference in the High Court Bail Application and

the corresponding affidavit filed, the Petitioner confirmed that her name

is A.Nishanthi Pradeepthani, as mentioned in her National Identity

Card. As such she has mentioned both names in this Revision

Application.

According to the Petitioner, the suspect is a three-wheeler driver by

profession and sometime drives his lorry on hire as well. Further, he is

a father of four children and two younger children are living under his

care at present. He is the sole breadwinner of the family.

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in

support of her Revision Application.

1. The suspect was arrested on 02.11.2021 and remanded to date

without filing any charge which prejudice his rights and his

family as well.

2. The suspect has undergone an eye surgery and after the surgery

he was not provided with a clean environment in the prison.

3. The statement of objection of the 1st Respondent was filed on

06.06.2022 and it is mentioned in the said statement that it has

been revealed that the suspect is a main suspect who takes large

quantities of Heroin from Pamunugama, Isiyogama area and

packs them in the Isiyogama area and distributes to several

areas. However, the same was not mentioned in the B Report

dated 03.11.2021 and /or any further reports filed before the

Magistrate Court, Welisara. Therefore, the 1st Respondent has

submitted false information before the Court to object to granting

of bail to the suspect.

4. According to the 1st B Report, the suspect was searched at No.04,

Isiyogama, Unswetakeiyawa and found drugs from his trouser

pocket. The Petitioner states that aforementioned address is the

address of the house of the Petitioner.

CA PHC APN 143-2022

5. No drugs were found in the possession of the suspect by the

police officers and he was taken to the police station and

introduced Heroin at the police station upon the influence of a

person called Roshan Dias.

6. No information was revealed relating to the trafficking of Heroin

as per the B Report filed first and further reports filed before the

Magistrate Court of Welisara.

7. The suspect has no previous conviction or pending case before

any court.

The State opposing to bail submitted that the indictment pertaining to

the offence is already being sent to the High Court of Negombo. Hence,

Learned State Counsel submitted that the delay is not an exceptional

circumstance to be considered to enlarge the suspect on bail. Further,

the time spent for preparing the indictment does not constitute an

exceptional circumstance.

The suspect is in remand for little more than one and half years.

According to Government Analyst Report the pure quantity of Heroin

detected is 27.34 grams.

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what

is exceptional circumstances must be considered on its own facts and

circumstances on a case by case.

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

In K.Sithum Shamika v. The Attorney General CA(PHC)APN

107/2018 decided on 19.03.2019 the court held that remanding for a

period of one year and five months without being served with the in

indictment was considered inter alia in releasing the suspect on bail.

CA PHC APN 143-2022

According to the Petitioner, at present her family is going through

untold hardship without proper income and care.

The Section 83 of the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act

which was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states:

83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under

sections 54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail

by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 84 and 85, a person

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A

and section 54B-

(a) of which the pure quantity of the dangerous drug, trafficked,

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A;

and

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment, shall not

be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in exceptional

circumstances.

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in

exceptional circumstances.

In this case the pure quantity of Heroin detected in the production by

the Government Analyst is 27.34grams. Hence, this court has

jurisdiction to consider granting of bail as per the new amendment.

According to the Learned High Court Judge, one of the reasons for the

rejection of bail to the suspect is the non-availability of the Government

Analyst report. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

Hence the Learned High Court Judge has considered that the

Government Analyst Report is one of the factors to be considered when

deciding a bail application.

In this case the net quantity of the Heroin is 27.34 grams. Further the

suspect is a first offender. I conclude these matters need to be

considered when granting of bail to the suspect.

Further, the Counsel for the Petitioner argued that the statement of

objection of the 1st Respondent was filed on 10.01.2023 in this Court

and it is mentioned in the said statement that it has been revealed that

the suspect is a main suspect who takes large quantities of Heroin from

Pamunugama, Isiyogama area and packs them in the Isiyogama area

and distributes to several areas. However, the same was not mentioned

in the B Report dated 03.11.2021 and /or any further reports filed

before the Magistrate Court, Welisara. Therefore, the 1st Respondent

has submitted false information before the Court to object to granting of

bail to the suspect.

CA PHC APN 143-2022

8 | P a g e

Upon perusal of the B Reports filed by the Officer-in-Charge,

Pamunugama Police Station nowhere mentioned that the suspect is the

person from Isiyogama area takes large quantities of Heroin packs and

distributes to several areas. As the 1st Respondent has taken up this

position first time in this Court, I too agree with the Learned Counsel

for the Petitioner that the 1st Respondent had submitted false

information to object for bail.

The Counsel for the Petitioner contended that the Learned High Court

had disregarded that the suspect had been falsely accused over a

money transaction and the affidavit of the daughter of the person who

caused the suspect to be so falsely accused. The relevant portion of the

order of the Learned High court judge is re-produced below:

On perusal of the said portion of the order the Learned High Court

Judge, it reveals that the rejection is solely based on the assumption of

the Learned High Court Judge.

In Nasher v. Director of Public Prosecution [2020] VSCA 144 the

court held that:

a combination of delay, onerous custodial conditions, and the

relative weakness of the prosecution case may, when considered

with all relevant circumstances, compel the conclusion that

exceptional circumstances have been established.

CA PHC APN 143-2022

In this case, as per the submission of the Learned State Counsel, the

indictment had already been dispatched to the High Court of Negombo.

Trial has not commenced yet.

Hence, I consider the delay more than one and half years in remand

falls into the category of excessive and oppressive delay considering the

circumstances of this case. Considering other matters which had

escaped the attention of the Learned High Court Judge of Negombo, the

suspect has very good exceptional circumstances to consider this

application in favour of him.

Offences under Section 54A(b) and 54A(c) of the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is no

doubt serious offences but seriousness of the offence alone cannot form a

ground to refuse bail. In considering these matters, the court must bear in mind

the presumption of innocence.

Considering all these factors into account, especially the pure quantity

of Heroin detected and the circumstances of the case, I consider this an

appropriate case to grant bail to the suspect. Hence, I order the suspect

to be granted bail with the following strict conditions.

1. Cash bail of Rs.100,000/=.

2. To provide 02 sureties. They must sign a bond of two million

each.

3. The suspect and the sureties must reside in the address given

until conclusion of his case.

4. Not to approach any prosecution witnesses directly or indirectly

or to interfere with.

5. To surrender his passport if any, to court and not to apply for a

travel document. The Controller of the Immigration and

Emigration is informed of the travel ban on the suspect.

6. To report to the Pamunugama Police Station on the last Sunday

of every month between 9am to 1pm.

CA PHC APN 143-2022

7. Any breach of these conditions is likely to result in the

cancellation of his bail.

The Revision Application is allowed and the Learned High Court Judge

High Court of Negombo is hereby directed to enlarge the suspect on bail

on the above bail conditions.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this Judgment

to the High Court of Negombo and Officer-in-Charge of the Police

Station Pamunugama.

The Application is allowed.
