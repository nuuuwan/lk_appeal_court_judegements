JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) along with 1st accused were indicted jointly in the High Court of

Polonnaruwa under Section 296 of the Penal Code for committing double

murder of Mullegama Randilisi Mudiyanselage Ciciliya and Keliyegedera

Jayathilaka on or about 25th July 1993. As the 1st accused passed away

during the pendency of the trial, the indictment was amended accordingly.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Polonnaruwa as the

Appellants had opted for a non-jury trial. After the conclusion of the

prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge had called for the defence

and the Appellants had given evidence from the witness box and subjected

to lengthy cross examination by the prosecution. After considering the

evidence presented by both parties, the learned High Court Judge had

convicted the Appellants as charged and sentenced them to death on

04/06/2015.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants have given consent to argue this matter in their absence due to

the Covid 19 pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellants were

connected via Zoom platform from prison.

Background of the Case.

The prosecution case is rest on testimony of an eye witness and

circumstantial evidence.

PW1 Seelawathie is the eye witness in this case. The incident had

happened in the house of 1st deceased Cicilia who is the aunt of this

witness. The 2nd deceased Jayathilaka is the son of 1st deceased and the

cousin of this witness. The 1st accused and the 1st Appellant in this case

were the brothers-in-law of 2nd deceased Jayathilake who had married to

their elder sister. At the time of the incident, they were estranged as their

marriage had broken off. The witness had moved to this house as most of

the time the 2nd deceased was away from home leaving the 1st deceased

alone.

On the date of the incident after dinner while they were watching T.V.

around 9.00 p.m. the 2nd deceased went into his room to sleep and the 1st

deceased carrying a plastic cup had gone towards the front of the house to

brush her teeth. Within 2-3 minutes after 1st deceased went out, the

witness had heard her screaming thrice. (wfma wmafmda wfma wmafmda wfma wmafmda)

Hearing the scream when she ran towards the front door had seen 2nd

deceased also coming out of his room and three persons had surrounded

him at the entrance of the room. She had identified the intruders as the 1st

accused (now deceased),1st Appellant and 2nd Appellant from the light

emanating from the lights which were on in the hall, the portico and the

T.V. The 1st accused and the 1st Appellants were known person to PW1 and

the 2nd Appellant was identified at the identification parade by PW1. She

had seen 1st accused and the 1st Appellant holding 2nd deceased and 1st

Appellant cutting him with a sword.

Due to fear PW1 had escaped the house from rear door and cried for help

running towards PW3 Kusumawathies house. She had only come to the

house after the arrival of the police. At that time, she had seen the 1st

5 | P a g e

deceased fallen down face downwards close to the main door. As the 2nd

deceased had been taken to hospital, she had only noticed blood and two

severed fingers said to be that of the 2nd deceased lying fallen close to the

room.

As the wife of 2nd deceased and the sister of 1st accused and 1st Appellant

had left house of 2nd deceased, both parties were not in good terms during

this period. On two occasions the 1st accused and 2nd Appellant had

threatened the 1st deceased and PW1.As such the 1st deceased had lodged a

complaint at the Polonnaruwa Police Station.

PW2 Anula Jayanthi is a relation to the deceased party. She lived closed to

the 1st deceaseds house. On the day of the incident, hearing the screaming

of 1st deceased (wfma wmafmda wfma wmafmda) when she came out of her house and

remained there for about 10 minutes, the 1st Appellant who had been

known to her from her school days come up to the fence and threatened

her not come forward to give evidence. (wfma wmafmda wfma wmafmda lsh,d lE

.;a;d fu;k fudkjd yrs fjkjd lsh,d') She identified him by his voice. She

also confirmed the existence of animosity due to the breakdown of 2nd

deceaseds marriage.

PW3, Kusumawathie had corroborated the evidence given by PW2, but she

had failed to identify the person who had threatened them not to give

evidence.

PW19, the main investigating officer IP/Prasanna who visited the scene of

crime had noted a plastic cup fallen near the 1st deceaseds body. Further

he had noted blood and severed part of human fingers near the door of the

2nd deceaseds room.

PW16, PC/19000 Weerasinghe had arrested the 1st Appellant and the 1st

accused when they surrendered to police on 26.07.1993 with a sword and

an iron rod.

The doctor who held the post mortem of the deceased Ciciliya had noted 08

cut injuries on her head and back of the shoulder. According to him the

6 | P a g e

cause of death is due to severe brain damage due to cut injuries on the

head.

The AJMO who held the post mortem of Jayathilaka had noted 16 cut

injuries on the head, left upper limb and right upper limb. According to

him the cause of death is due to Cranio Cerebral injuries caused by sharp

cutting weapon.

The Appellants had separately canvassed their Appeal grounds through

their counsel.

The First Appellant had filed the following grounds of appeal.

1. The infirmities in the evidence of the main eye witness have not

been given due consideration.

2. The Learned High Court Judge did not observe any of the eye

witnesses give evidence.

3. The suspicious nature of the evidence of garments of the accused

taken as productions should have been carefully analyzed by the

trial judge.

4. The alibi taken by the accused have not been adequately

considered by the Learned Trial Judge.

The Second Appellant had filed the following grounds of appeal.

1. Identification of the 2nd Appellant at the scene of crime is

doubtful.

2. The evidence of 2nd Appellant who gave evidence under oaths had

not been evaluated and no reason given for its rejection.

3. Contradiction V1 which goes to the root of the case was not

considered by Learned High Court Judge.

7 | P a g e

The Learned Presidents Counsel for 1st Appellant had contended under 1st

ground of appeal that the infirmities in the evidence of the main eye

witness have not been given due consideration.

The Learned Presidents Counsel strenuously argued that the Learned Trial

Judge had failed to consider all the circumstances whether PW1,

Seelawathie had witnessed the incident as claimed by her in her testimony.

As stated above, PW1 Seelawathie who is an eye witness had vividly

explained how this gruesome incident had happened. She had clearly seen

the attack on the 2nd deceased Jayatilaka before she could escape from the

house.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment had considered the

evidence given by PW1 extensively and properly analyzed her evidence in its

correct perspective. Further learned High Court Judge had reasonably

considered all evidence direct and circumstantial to come to his decision.

Further, the eye witness PW1 had given evidence in the High Court nearly

17 years after the incident. I consider her evidence is clear and cogent and

not shaken her credibility or testimonial trustworthiness.

Although motive is not necessary to prove in a criminal trial, existence of a

motive would strengthen the prosecution case. In this case the evidence

revealed that an enmity existed between parties due to the sister of 1st

accused and 1st Appellant who married to the 2nd deceased Jayathilaka had

left her matrimonial house due to a family dispute with her husband the

2nd deceased. This had led to the 1st accused and 1st Appellant threatening

1st deceased Cicilia with regard to their sisters issue of leaving the

matrimonial house.

As the Learned High Court had Judge had considered all these evidence in

his judgment, it is incorrect to say that the Learned High Court Judge had

failed to give due consideration to the evidence of PW1, Seelawathie. Hence,

I conclude this ground has no merit.

8 | P a g e

Under 2nd ground of appeal of 1st Appellant, the Learned Presidents

Counsel contended that the Learned High Court Judge did not observe any

of the eye witnesses give evidence in the court.

In a criminal trial it is not always possible to a trial judge to observe all the

witnesses who had testified before a court. This is due to various factors

including the transfers and retirement of judicial officers.

In this case the learned High Court Judge even though he had not had the

benefit to observe the demeanor and the deportment of the witness who

gave evidence during the trial, had properly evaluated the evidence given by

both sides to arrive at a correct finding. Considering the entirety of the

judgment, it is incorrect to say that the learned High Court Judge had

totally disregarded Section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No.15 of 1979. Hence, this ground too has no merit for consideration.

In the 3rd ground of appeal of the 1st Appellant, the Learned Presidents

Counsel argued that the suspicious nature of the evidence of garments of

the accused taken as productions should have been carefully analyzed by

the trial judge.

According to PW16, PC Weerasinghe, he had arrested the 1st accused and

the 1st Appellant when they surrendered to police on 26/07/1993 with a

sword and an iron rod. Further he had taken into custody the blood-

stained clothes from them.

The Learned Presidents Counsel argued that as PW16 got into difficulty

when he was questioned by court on this matter during course of his

examination-in-chief, his evidence should have been carefully analyzed by

the trial judge due to the reason that the 1st Appellant vehemently denied

that they handed over any weapon to the police upon their surrender.

Hence, Learned Presidents Counsel further argued that said evidence given

by PW16 regarding productions was a fabrication against them.

9 | P a g e

The Learned High Court Judge in his Judgment had considered the

evidence of PW16 extensively. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

As the Learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence of PW16 in

his judgement, this ground of appeal also devoid any merit.

In the final ground appeal of the 1st Appellant, the Learned Presidents

Counsel contended that the alibi taken by the accused have not been

adequately considered by the Learned Trial Judge.

It is trite law that no burden is cast upon the accused to prove his alibi, as

alibi is not a defence. It is the duty of the Learned High Court Judge to

consider the alibi and if doubt arises in the mind of the Learned Trial

Judge, the benefit of the doubt be awarded to the accused.

The Learned High Court Judge in his evidence at pages 810 to 816 of the

brief had considered the evidence given by the 1st Appellant. Although he

had taken up the position that he had spent the night in the paddy field,

but had denied that he told police that he spent the night in the paddy

10 | P a g e

field. This contradiction had been marked as D8 by the prosecution. The

relevant portion is re-produced below:

As this a vital contradiction on the evidence given by the 1st Appellant with

regard to his alibi, I consider it is reasonable to disregard his evidence by

the Learned High Court Judge in this case. Hence, this ground also has no

merit.

I will now consider the appeal grounds advanced by the 2nd Appellant.

In his 1st ground of appeal, the Counsel for the 2nd Appellant contended

that the identification of the 2nd Appellant at the scene of crime is doubtful.

This is because PW1 is a close relation of both the deceased and he was

living with the 1st Appellants house 2-3 years prior to the incident and

therefore, he was a known person to the witness.

In this case PW1 had clearly implicated that the 2nd Appellant was

positively aided by holding the 2nd deceased when he was cut. This stance

was never changed by the witness. Although the 2nd Appellant was not

identified by his name, the witness had clearly said that she could identify

him if she sees him again. Although PW1 knew that 2nd Appellant was

residing in the 1st Appellants house, but she had seen him first time at the

crime scene along with 1st accused and 1st Appellant. The marked

contradictions V1 and V2 on her evidence are not pertains to 2nd Appellant.

According to PW1 after hearing the cries of 1st deceased Cicilia when she

looked at the front door, the 1st accused, and the Appellants were standing

near the door of the 2nd deceaseds room. Her stance that she did not see

the Appellants and the 1st accused entering the house had been maintained

throughout her evidence. Hence contradiction marked as V3 is not forceful

enough to create a doubt on the prosecution case, the rejection of that

11 | P a g e

contradiction has not caused any prejudice to the 2nd Appellant. Further,

none of the witnesses are expected give 100% accurate evidence in a trial.

In State of Uttar Pradesh v. M. K. Anthony [AIR 1985 SC 48] the court

held that:

While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach

must be whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole

appears to have a ring of truth. Once that impression is formed,

it is undoubtedly necessary for the court to scrutinise the

evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies,

draw-backs and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a

whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the

general tenor of the evidence given by the witness and whether

the earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken as to render it

unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not

touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach by

taking sentences torn out of context here or there from the

evidence, attaching importance to some technical error

committed by the investigating officer not going to the : root of

the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence

as a whole. Even honest and truthful witnesses may differ in

some details unrelated to the main incident because power of

observation, retention and reproduction differ with individuals.

Cross examination is an unequal duel between a rustic and

refined lawyer.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment at pages 787-788 and

pages 808-809 of the judgment had considered the evidence pertains to the

identification of 2nd Appellant as follows:

Therefore, this ground of appeal has no merit as the Learned High Court

Judge had correctly considered the positive evidence pertains to identity of

the 2nd Appellant.

In his 2nd ground of appeal, the Learned Counsel for the 2nd Appellant

argued that the evidence of 2nd Appellant who gave evidence under oaths

had not been evaluated and no reasons given for its rejection.

The Learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence given by 2nd

Appellant in his judgment. After the evidence given by 1st and 2nd Appellant

the Learned High Court Judge had considered their evidence in keeping

with the legal principles that has to be followed in deciding a criminal trial.

The Learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence presented by

the prosecution as true and therefore rejected the evidence of the defence.

Hence, this ground also has no merit.

In the final ground the Counsel for the 2nd Appellant contended that the

Contradiction V1 which goes to the root of the case was not considered by

Learned High Court Judge.

According to PW1, 2nd Appellant was the person who possessed the sword

and cut the 2nd deceased mercilessly and 1st accused had possessed an

14 | P a g e

iron rod. But in the non-summary she had said that 1st accused had cut

the 2nd deceased with a sword. This contradiction was marked as V1 by the

defence.

Considering the fact that witness PW1 had given evidence after 17 years of

the incident the contradiction marked V1 does not impeach the credibility

or the testimonial trustworthiness of her evidence. Further learned High

Court Judge had given due consideration to her evidence when he analyzed

her evidence in his judgment.

In The Attorney General v.Sandanam Pitchai Mary Theresa [2011] 2

SLR 292 the court held that:

Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect

the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that

the Court must exercise its judgment on the nature of the inconsistency

or contradiction and whether they are true material to the facts in

issue.

Considering the circumstances under which the eye witness had witnessed

the incident and the time period she had given evidence after the incident

before the High Court, I consider the contradiction highlighted under this

ground of appeal has no significant to this case as it is not forceful enough

to affect the root of the case.

In this case the learned High Court Judge had considered and analyzed the

evidence accurately even though he did not have the advantage of seeing

the demeanour and deportment of the witnesses who had given evidence

before his predecessor.

Further, the Appellants had given evidence under oaths and had been

subjected to cross-examination by the State Counsel.

The single most important criterion in evaluating the fairness of a trial is

the observance of the principle of equality of arms between the defence and

the prosecution. Equality of arms, which must be observed throughout the

15 | P a g e

trial, means that both parties are treated in a manner ensuring their

procedurally equal position during the course of the trial.

In this case the learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence

presented by both parties to arrive at his decision. He has properly

analyzed the evidence given by both sides in his judgment. As the evidence

adduced by the Appellants failed to create a doubt over the prosecution

case, the conclusion reached by the learned High Court Judge in this case

cannot be faulted.

As discussed under the appeal grounds advanced by the Appellants, the

prosecution had adduced strong and incriminating evidence against the

Appellants. The Learned High Court Judge had very correctly analyzed all

the evidence presented by all the parties and come to a correct finding that

the Appellants were guilty of committing the murder of both deceased in

this case.

Therefore, I affirm the conviction and dismiss the Appeal of the Appellants.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgement to

the High Court of Polonnaruwa along with the original case record.
