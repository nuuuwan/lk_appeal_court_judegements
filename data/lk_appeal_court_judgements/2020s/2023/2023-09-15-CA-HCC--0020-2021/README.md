CA/HCC 0020/2021

3 | P a g e

High Court Judge had called for the defence and the Appellant had made a

dock statement and closed the case. After considering the evidence presented

by both parties, the learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellant

as follows:

1. For the 1st count he was sentenced to death.

2. For the 2nd count he was sentenced to 8 years rigorous imprisonment

with a fine of Rs.15,000/-. In default a term of 1-year simple

imprisonment imposed.

3. For the 3rd count he was acquitted from the charge.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellant was connected via

Zoom platform from prison.

Counsel appearing for the Appellant has submitted the following grounds of

appeal.

1. The prosecution has failed to establish the corpus delicti beyond

reasonable doubt.

2. The Learned High Court Judge erred by relying upon the last seen

theory.

3. The ingredients of the charges are not proved beyond reasonable

doubt.

Background of the Case albeit briefly is as follows

According to PW1 Damayanthi, the Appellant is her brother-in-law. The

deceased is her sister who was married to Susantha Deepal, who is the 16th

witness in this case. Her mother, PW2, had a plot of land grown with tea.

CA/HCC 0020/2021

4 | P a g e

She had divided the same among her children keeping a portion for herself

too. All recipients of the land used to work in their respective portions of

land. On 03.09.2005, although it was a rainy day, the deceased had gone to

her land for work but had not returned. The deceased had gone to her land

despite the advice not to go, given by PW1 and PW2.The deceased was last

seen with a black pleated skirt and a black sleeveless T shirt. Further, she

had worn a pair of tussle earrings and a gold chain with a flower shaped

pendant. The deceased had left home between 7 to 7.30 am on that day. The

distance between her home and the land is approximately about 2 km. At

the relevant time, the deceaseds husband was in remand. Usually, the

deceased returns home at about 4.00 pm, after work. However, on that day

she had not returned home by that time. A search was carried out to find

out the deceased was not to be found. Hence, the witnesss elder sisters

husband PW7 had lodged a complaint at the Nivithigala Police Station on the

following day. The witness had looked for her sister for about one year but

she couldnt find her sister.

In the meantime, on 02.09.2006, two police officers from Nivithigala Police

Station had come to her house. At that time, the Appellant was in her house.

Although the police officers insisted the Appellant to come to the police

station to record a statement, the Appellant had surreptitiously evaded them.

The two police officers and PW1 had looked for the Appellant till in the

evening but the Appellant was not to be found.

On 05.09.2006, PW1 had received a call from the Appellant and he informed

PW1 that he knows where the Appo was Appo is the nick name of the

deceased. When she confronted with the Appellant about this information,

he said nothing. Thereafter, she had requested the Appellant to pass this

information to the police but he had done nothing.

On 07.09.2006, while PW1 was attending work at her plot of land, a woman

namely, Sumanawathi had told her that the Appellant had come to her

house. When she rushed to her house, she found the Appellant was inside

CA/HCC 0020/2021

5 | P a g e

and some people gathered outside.PW7 and a person called Rathasena had

taken the Appellant to the police. On 08.09.2006, PW1 had received a call

from the police. As per the request of police PW1 and her mother PW2 had

gone to a cave located within the close proximity of her house. As per the

request, when she and her mother looked into the cave, they had seen bones.

Thereafter the police had produced an earring worn by the deceased allegedly

to have been discovered from the place where the bones were scattered.

At the trial, PW1 had identified the earrings, a gold chain with a pendant and

the clothes worn by the deceased on the last date the deceased was seen

alive.

PW2, Agnes Nona had corroborated the evidence given by PW1.

According to PW3, Piyasena, he too had a plot of land close to the land

belonging to PW2. On the date of incident, he too had gone to his land to cut

a Kittul flower. As his Wadiya was situated close to the Kittul tree, he had

gone there to pluck some beetle. When he was in his Wadiya, the Appellant

had come there between 8.00-9.00 am, and asked for a bottle of Arrack. As

he was not in possessed immediately, he promised that he could arrange it

in the evening. Thereafter, both had gone to another Wadiya owned by PW5,

Peiris. He has seen the deceased also there. All had consumed tea and he

left the place leaving PW5 and the deceased. At that time PW4, Mallika also

had come there. After leaving the Wadiya of Peiris, he had not seen the

deceased alive after that.

PW4 Mallika also had corroborated the evidence of PW3. Further, she had

seen the deceased working in her plot of land in the morning.

According to PW16, Susantha Deepal, husband of the deceased, during the

relevant time was in the Kuruwita Prison and the deceased visited him and

advised him not to smoke cigarette, and not to have bad friendship. The

deceased last visited him on 25.08.2005. He had identified the gold chain of

the deceased.

CA/HCC 0020/2021

6 | P a g e

The Appellant had also visited PW16 and told him that there is a rumour

that the deceased had been concealed among rocks.

PW10, Ajith Tennakoon, the Consultant JMO carried out the post mortem

on the remains submitted to him by the police.

The clothes last worn by the deceased had been identified by her sisters. The

JMO had noticed a noose amongst the skeletal remains. According to the

JMO, the skull of the skeletal remains is belonged to a female. The said

opinion was arrived based on the smoothness of the skull and the fact that

it was small in size. The said conclusion was based on the premise that the

area of the skull bone which touches and flesh to not to have been formed

properly. Further, the front portion of the skull the forehead area of the skull

to be jutting out. The mastoid bone of the skull had been small in size and

naso frontal angle which is triangular in shape had also been observed to be

wide. The eye holes of the skull had also been circular in shape. According

to the JMO all these features were identified to be characteristic of a female

skull.

Further, the examination revealed basisphenoids suture to be fully closed.

This feature, according to the JMO, appear on a person who is more than 20

years. The JMO opined that the skull sutures get closed completely when

one is over 30 years of age. The JMO having examined the placing of the

basisphenoids suture and the skull suture arrived at the conclusion that the

skeleton remains belonged to a female between the age of 21 and 30 years.

According to the JMO, the lower jaw and the hip bone of the skeleton remains

had also comprised of a female characteristic. The front aspect of the hip

bone referred to as the symphysis comprises of gutters and protrusions when

the person is young. This too had been considered to be an age indicator. As

the person gets older these gutters and protrusions will disappear.

CA/HCC 0020/2021

7 | P a g e

Furthermore, examination revealed that the sacrum to be wide and circular

in shape. According to the JMO, this is an indicator that the bones belong to

a female.

The JMO had observed one of the ribs on the left side frontal aspect of the

body being subjected to an ante-mortem fracture. Further, the hyoid bone

had gone missing.

Following comments were made by the JMO in his Post Mortem Report.

1. The examination of the skeleton remains revealed that those bones

were of human origin and belongings to a female of 25-30 years of

age.

2. The deceased was identified by the relatives by the clothing found

with the remains.

3. There was a single ante-mortem rib fracture which may have been

caused by the blunt force. (This could have been caused by blow

from a fist)

4. There was no evidence of fatal injuries in bones to establish the

cause of death.

5. Presence of a ligature made from a meshy gunny bag with a running

knot may suggest strangulation.

The JMO opined that the fracture on the left rib could have been caused by

a person sitting on the body of the deceased for the purpose of fixing the

noose on the neck of the deceased. Further, the JMO had identified the

fracture to be ante-mortem injury based on the following:

The fact that there was evidence that there had been a flowing of blood

on the bone,

As the bone had got discoloured by the blood.

CA/HCC 0020/2021

8 | P a g e

The JMO had categorically ruled out the impossibility of suicide based on

the premise that the material used to make the noose had not been strong

enough and there cannot be a rib fracture in the event a suicide had taken

place.

The remains were not sent for DNA test as there was no facility available at

that time.

PW11 IP/Malawiarachchi was the Officer-in-Charge of the Crime Unit of the

Nivithigala Police Station in the year 2005. After receiving the complaint with

regard to the disappearance of the deceased, he had commenced proper

investigation in to the disappearance of the deceased upon receiving a letter

from the PW16, the husband of the deceased. He had sent the letter while he

was in the Kuruvita Prison. PW11 had commenced his investigation on

08.09.2006.

Firstly, the Appellant was taken into custody at his wifes residence. At the

time of arrest, the Appellant had tried to escape from the police custody. A

statement was recorded in the police jeep itself. The Appellant made a

statement under section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance and revealed where

the deceaseds body was and pawning receipt of deceaseds gold chain.

As per the information, the police team had gone in the jeep up to a place

called 26 Kella with the Appellant. Thereafter the team had gone into forest

reserve with much difficulty. From there the team had gone to a place called

26 Dola. The Appellant had then pointed a rocky cave like structure which

had comprised of two rocks covered by another rock hidden under a mass of

thorny bushes and reeds. Thereafter, on the pointing of the Appellant, they

recovered the skeleton remains of the deceased inside a rocky cave which is

about 5 feet in height. The rocky cave only surfaced after the cleaning of the

thorn bushes and reeds with much difficulty. As it was dark inside the cave,

after flashing a torch PW11 had spotted the skull and a ball of hair lying next

to the skull. There had been a piece of black cloth amongst the ball of hair.

CA/HCC 0020/2021

9 | P a g e

Next the witness had spotted a skeleton remain of a foot lying near the mouth

of the cave. Upon further search, an earring which glittered under the torch

light was found lying inside the cave.

Thereafter, PW11 and several police officers had gone to the Appellants

house and recovered a pawning receipt from a tube used to fix the lamp. The

receipt number is 3602819, issued by the Peoples Bank Kahawatta Branch

in the name of the Appellant and his identity card number for pawning a gold

chain for Rs.11000/-.Upon a Court order the gold chain was taken into

police custody.

After the Magisterial inquiry, the skeleton remains were sent for post mortem

examination. The prosecution had closed the case after leading prosecution

witnesses and marking productions P1-16. When the defence was called the

Appellant made a dock statement and closed the case.

In his dock statement the Appellant while denying the charge, admitted the

fact that he lived with his wife in his wifes house. In definite terms the

Appellant had stated that the deceased had joined him to go to the estate

and also that she had left earlier.

In this case, the conviction is solely based on circumstantial evidence. It is

well settled law that when the conviction is solely based on circumstantial

evidence, the prosecution must prove that no one else but the Appellant had

committed the crime. The below cited authorities set out the position

succinctly.

In King v. Abeywickrema Et Al 44 NLR 254 the court held that:

In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the Jury

must be satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt

of the accused and inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis

of his innocence.

CA/HCC 0020/2021

10 | P a g e

In the case of Tamil Nadu v. Rajendran Appeal (Cr.L) 917 of 1996 the Indian

Supreme Court observed that:

In a case of circumstantial evidence when an incriminating

circumstance is put to the accused and the said accused either

offers no explanation or offers an explanation which is found to

be untrue, then the same becomes an additional link in the chain

of circumstances to make it complete.

Hence, it is incumbent upon the prosecution that none other than the

Appellant had committed the murder of the deceased.

In this appeal as the 1st and 3rd grounds raised are interconnected, those two

grounds will be considered jointly hereinafter. In the first ground of appeal,

the Appellant contend that the prosecution has failed to establish the corpus

delicti beyond reasonable doubt. In the third ground of appeal, the Appellant

contends that the ingredients of the charges are not proved beyond

reasonable doubt.

Corpus delicti literally means "body of the crime" in Latin. In its original

sense, the body in question refers not to a corpse but to the body of

essential facts that, taken together, prove that a crime has been

committed. In popular usage, corpus delicti also refers to the actual

physical object upon which a crime has been committed. In a case of

murder case, the victim's corpse.

E.R.S.R.Coomaraswamy in his book The Law of Evidence (Book 2

Vol.page 932) states:

The judge must in a case of murder or culpable homicide direct the

jury on the necessary ingredients of the relevant offence;

a) The death of the deceased,

b) That the accused caused the death,

CA/HCC 0020/2021

11 | P a g e

c) That the accused had the murderous intention in a case of

murder or the necessary intention or knowledge in a case of

culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

When a charge of murder is preferred against an accused, the evidence

offered has to connect the accused with the crime.

In this case, the deceased went to her tea plantation on 03.05.2005 in the

morning in a rainy weather. But she had not returned. The Appellant

admitted in his dock statement that the deceased went with him together

but she had returned earlier. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

While the investigation was going on, according to PW1, on 02.09.2006, two

police officers had come to her house. At that time the Appellant had been

there. When the police officers asked the Appellant to come to the Nivithigala

Police Station to record a statement regarding the disappearance of the

deceased, the Appellant had however managed to escape from the police on

that day.

Further on 05.09.2006, PW1 had received a call from the Appellant and he

informed that he knew where Appo was. Appo is the nick name of the

deceased. When she told the Appellant to pass this information to police, he

did not do it.

CA/HCC 0020/2021

12 | P a g e

In RM Malkani v State of Maharashtra, AIR 1973 SC 157, conversation

over telephone for settling details for passing bribe-money was recorded by

secret instruments. This was held by Apex Court to be evidence of conduct.

According to PW16, the husband of the deceased, the Appellant had visited

him at the Kuruwita Prison and told him that his wife has been concealed

among rocks. When he confronted with the Appellant about this story, he

just left the place abruptly. As this caused serious doubt on the Appellant,

he had told this to the Prison Superintendent who wrote it down and

forwarded it to the police.

The relevant portion is re-produced below:

The previous and subsequent conduct of the Appellant also gives rise to a

reasonable suspicion about him. Now I consider whether the previous and

subsequent conduct of the Appellant are relevant to this case.

Section 8(1) and 8(2) of Evidence Ordinance are read as follows:

8 (1) Any fact is relevant which shows or constitute a motive or

preparation for any fact in issue or relevant fact.

8 (2) The conduct of any party, or of any agent to any party, to any suit

or proceedings in reference to such suit or proceedings or in reference

to any fact in issue therein or relevant thereto, and the conduct of any

person an offence against whom is the subject of any proceeding, if

CA/HCC 0020/2021

13 | P a g e

such conduct influences or is influenced by any fact in issue or

relevant fact, and whether it was previous or subsequent thereto.

The three incidents mentioned above clearly shows the suspicious conduct

of the Appellant.

The court has to take into account, most seriously, both the previous and

subsequent conduct of the accused before drawing any conclusion regarding

the guilt or innocence of the accused and very rightly so. It is by analysing

carefully the conduct of the accused both previous and subsequent that the

court draws its own logical inference. Therefore, the role of conduct and

importance of its evidentiary value can never be overlooked or

underestimated by any court in determining the conviction or acquittal of

the accused. In certain cases, the previous conduct of the accused throws

light on whether the accused is innocent or guilty whereas in some cases it

is the subsequent conduct that becomes very important in determining the

innocence or guilt of the accused. So, it is the bounden duty of all the

concerned courts to analyse carefully both the previous and subsequent

conduct of the accused before drawing any definite conclusions.

The legality of the recovery made under Section 27(1) Evidence Ordinance

has been discussed in several cases in our jurisdiction.

According to Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance-

When any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of

information received from a person accused of any offence, in

the custody of a police officer, so much of such information,

whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly

to the fact thereby discovered may be proved.

CA/HCC 0020/2021

14 | P a g e

The Supreme Court in the case of Somaratne Rajapakse Others v. Hon.

Attorney General (2010) 2 Sri L.R. 113 at 115 stated that:

A vital limitation on the scope of Section 27 of the Evidence

Ordinance is that only the facts which are distinctly related to

what has been discovered would be permitted in evidence. 'There

should be a clear nexus between the information given by the

accused and the subsequent discovery of a relevant fact. A

discovery made in terms of Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance

discloses that the information given was true and that the

Accused had knowledge of the existence and the whereabouts of

the actual discovery.

After the arrest of the Appellant, PW11 had recorded his statement and

recovered the skeleton remains of the deceased and the gold chain of the

deceased under section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

PW11 in his evidence stated that they reached the place where the skeleton

remains were found with much difficulty as the place was under a mass of

thorny busses and reeds. The rocky cave had surfaced only after the cleaning

of the thorn busses and reeds with the greatest difficulty.

In De Saram v The Republic of Sri Lanka [2002] 1 SLR page 288 held that:

for the basis of admissibility of the accused statement was not that the

accused confessed to the crime but the fact that he knew where the

deceaseds body was buried. Evidence of the accuseds information

was therefore admissible under section 27(1) of the Evidence

Ordinance.

In this case, after the arrest of the Appellant, the investigating officer had

properly followed the necessary requirements under section 27(1) of

Evidence Ordinance and had recovered the skeleton remains of the deceased

CA/HCC 0020/2021

15 | P a g e

and the gold chain of the deceased and presented it to court properly to

establish nexus to the alleged offence by the Appellant. As no improper

procedure has been followed to adduce this evidence in the trial, the Learned

High Court Judge had very correctly considered this as admissible evidence

in his judgment.

PW10, Dr.Ajith Tennakoon, a well experienced Consultant Judicial Medical

Officer had conducted the post mortem on the remains recovered under

section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance. Using his expertise and knowledge

in the field of Judicial Medical Science, he had expressed his opinion with

credible reasons that the recovered skeleton remains were belonging to a

female who was between ages of 21 to 30 years. Further, he had come to

logical conclusions correctly by excluding the possibility of suicide. The High

Court Judge had correctly accepted his opinion expressed under Section 45

of the Evidence Ordinance.

Considering the evidence that the PW1 had looked for the deceased about

one year, the Appellants evasion from giving statement and evading giving a

statement to the two police officers who came to PW1s residence for

investigation, the Appellant giving a phone call to PW1 and informed that he

knows whereabouts of the deceased also known as Appo, the Appellant

meeting the deceaseds husband at the Kuruwita Prison and informing him

that he knew that the deceased was concealed among rocks, the attempt to

run away when he was arrested, the recovery of the remains of the deceased

upon the statement of the Appellant made under section 27(1) of the

Evidence Ordinance, identification of the deceaseds earrings and clothes

worn at the time of her disappearance, the recovery of the gold chain of the

deceased pawned in a bank in the name of the Appellant and his identity

card, the conclusion reached by the JMO that the skeleton remains belonged

to a human being, between the ages of 21-30 years, the relations identified

the remains as to the deceaseds by her last worn clothes and the earring,

ante-mortem rib fracture caused by a blunt weapon and there is a possibility

CA/HCC 0020/2021

16 | P a g e

that the death would have been caused by a ligature strangulation are indeed

a clinching and definitive character unerringly leading to the inference that

the victim concerned has met with a homicidal death. It is further established

that the evidence led was sufficient to come to the conclusion that within all

the probability, the deceased had been murdered by the Appellant. Hence,

the 1st and 3rd appeal grounds have no merit at all.

In the 2nd ground of appeal, the Counsel for the Appellant contends that the

Learned High Court Judge erred by relying upon the last seen theory.

In this case according to PW3 and PW4, all had tea at a Wadiya owned by

Peiris Aiya. But none of the witness said that they had last seen the deceased

with the Appellant. Hence, I too agree that the application of last seen theory

in to this case is not proper. Hence, I conclude that the 2nd ground of appeal

has merit.

It is well settled law that when the conviction is solely based on

circumstantial evidence, the prosecution must prove that no one else but the

Appellant had committed the crime. In this case, considering all the

circumstances, the only cogent inference that can be drawn is that the

Appellant had committed the offence.

The Appellant in his dock statement denied the allegation levelled against

him. Though he has not been bound by law to offer any explanation, he failed

to offer an explanation when strong and incriminating evidence had been led

against him.

Having with regard to the nature of the circumstantial evidence led by the

prosecution, I am inclined to accept the submissions of the learned Deputy

Solicitor General that the strong items of circumstantial evidence

unexplained by the Appellant would itself be adequate to establish the

charges against the Appellant. Hence, I am of the view that the learned trial

Judge has rightly convicted the Appellant for the charges of Murder and

CA/HCC 0020/2021

17 | P a g e

Robbery levelled against him. In the said circumstances I see no reason to

interfere with the Judgement of the High Court Judge dated 11.02.2021.

Hence, I affirm the conviction and dismiss the Appeal of the Appellant.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Ratnapura along with the original case record.
