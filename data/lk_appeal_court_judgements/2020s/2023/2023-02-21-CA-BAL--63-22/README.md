Argued on: 19.01.2023

Decided on: 21.02.2023

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to obtain bail for the suspect

namely Yaddehige Saman under the provisions of the Assistance to and

Protection of Victims and Witnesses act.

The allegation against the suspect had been made by Kasun Pushpa

kumara who has made a statement to police on 31.5.2022 stating that

when he came to give evidence against the suspect on 5.5.2022 that the

suspect while waiting for his case to be called in Magistrates Court of

Matara the suspect had told the witness not to give evidence against him.

As such the witness had refrained from giving evidence and the learned

Magistrate also had made an observation in the case record that the

witness is willfully refraining from giving evidence and had moved to

remand the witness.

As such the police had reported facts under the instant act against the

suspect and has recorded the statement of the above mentioned

witness and he had admitted that he was under threat and duress on

5.5.2022 in Court.

The Counsel appearing for the Respondents vehemently objected to the

application on the basis that the suspect had put a witness under threat

and duress inside the Court premises and the learned Magistrate had

observed his reluctance to give evidence in the case record which is a

good enough testimony of the conduct of the suspect.

The Counsel for the suspect stated that although the suspect was

arrested and produced under the instant act meaningful action is yet to

be taken against the suspect by the authorities.

The law pertaining to the instant matter is that if a suspect is to be

enlarged on bail under this act he has to show exceptional circumstances

to obtain bail by the Court of Appeal.

The term exceptional has not been defined in the act but in the cases so

far decided have held that exceptionality of circumstances have to be

determined case by case.

But in the instant matter we observe that the complainant who has come

to Court to give evidence has been dealt by the suspect inside Court

premises which shows scant disregard for the entire Court system. As

such if bail is considered for the instant suspect at this juncture, we

conclude that it is a mockery of justice and violates the fundamental

purpose of the act which is to safeguard the rights of victims and

witnesses.

As such the instant application for bail is hereby refused.
