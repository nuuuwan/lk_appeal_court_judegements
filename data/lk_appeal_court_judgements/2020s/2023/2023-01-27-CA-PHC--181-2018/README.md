Judgment

The 2nd Party-Petitioner-Appellant had preferred this appeal seeking to set aside the

Order made by the learned High Court Judge dated 04.10.2018 in HCRA 113/2018

and Order made by the learned Magistrate of Nugegoda dated 04.09.2018 in

Magistrates Court case No.24055.

Page 3 of 7

It appears that the Officer in Charge of the Police Station-Kohuwala had filed an

information on 29.03.2018 in terms of the Primary Courts Procedure Act naming

Liyanarachchige Sandya Namali as 1st Party and Liyanarachchige Namal as 2nd Party.

It is seen that the said report was filed by Police upon the statement made by the

1st Party on 02.03.2018, consequent to the complaint made by the 1st Party by way

of a fax message. Apparently, in the said fax message, it was inadvertently dated

23.02.2017 instead of 23.02.2018. The said fax message had been affixed in the

information book on 26.02.2018.

It was stated by the 1st Party that after sending the said complaint by way of a fax,

the 1st Party arrived in Sri Lanka on 02.03.2018 and on the very same day made the

said statement to the Police Station-Kohuwala.

The position taken by the 2nd Party was that he had been residing in the premises

bearing No. 24, Bandaranayake Mawatha, Kalubowila, Dehiwala with his

grandmother who helped him build a portion of the said premises referred to as No.

24/1, Bandaranayake Mawatha, Kalubowila, Dehiwala.

However, after the conclusion of the said Magistrates Court case, the learned

Magistrate acting as the Primary Court Judge had delivered the Order on 04.09.2018

in favour of the 1st Party. Being aggrieved by the said Order, the 2nd Party-Petitioner

had invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Western

Province holden in Colombo through case bearing No. HCRA 113/2018.

After the supporting of the application on behalf of the 2nd Party-Petitioner and the

learned High Court Judge having heard the submissions made on behalf of the 2nd

Party-Petitioner in support of the application, had made an Order refusing to issue

notice on the Respondents and dismissed the application of the 2nd Party-Petitioner

in limine on 04.10.2018.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of dismissal, the 2nd Party-Petitioner-Appellant

[hereinafter referred to as the Appellant] had preferred this appeal against the 1st

Party-Respondent-Respondent [hereinafter referred to as the Respondent].

It was contended by the Appellant that learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider that although the initial fax message dated 23.02.2017 which is corrected

as 23.02.2018 (document marked as P2a) is pertaining to a premises referred to

Page 4 of 7

as No. 24A, Bandaranayake Mawatha, Kalubowila, Dehiwala. Nowhere else does the

Respondent refers to the said premises on the documents submitted to Courts in

support of the case. Instead, the Respondent refers only to premises bearing No.

24/1, Bandaranayake Mawatha, Kalubowila, Dehiwala.

As such, it was submitted that the property which forms the subject matter of this

application remains uncertain. In this backdrop of uncertainty, it was contended

that it is contrary to the spirit of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979

to deprive the Appellant of his propriety rights in this manner and to adjudicate on

such premise which itself is uncertain. It is to be observed that the Appellant had

not taken up the said position before the learned High Court Judge.

The statement made by the Respondent on 02.03.2018 indicated the assessment

number of the premises in dispute as No. 24/1, Bandaranayake Mawatha,

Kalubowila, Dehiwala. Moreover, affidavits filed by the Respondent and Welu

Jayakumar referred to the assessment number of the disputed premises as No. 24/1.

It is pertinent to note that the report filed by the Officer in Charge of the Police

Station-Kohuwala also indicates the disputed premises as No. 24/1, Bandaranayake

Mawatha, Kalubowila, Dehiwala. Therefore, it is clear that the disputed premises is

No. 24/1, Bandaranayake Mawatha, Kalubowila, Dehiwala.

On behalf of the Appellant, it was submitted that the learned High Court Judge has

failed to consider the failure of the learned Magistrate to appreciate as to under

what provision of law, the instant action has been instituted.

The attention of Court was drawn to document P2 report filed by the Officer in

Charge of Police Station-Kohuwala, which indicated the facts reported in the

information were under Section 66 (1) (b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No.

44 of 1979. Similarly, the learned Magistrate in her Order dated 04.09.2018 has

referred to Section 66 (1) (b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979.

It is pertinent to note that the learned High Court Judge has addressed the said

position in his Order.

Since the Officer in Charge of the Police Station-Kohuwala had initiated proceedings

in the Magistrates Court of Nugegoda, the said information has to be filed under

Section 66(1) (a) of the Act and not as a private plaint in terms of Section 66(1) (b)

Page 5 of 7

in the Magistrates Court. Hence, it is apparent that report (P2) and the Order of

the Magistrate had inadvertently referred to Section 66 (1) (b) instead of Section 66

(1) (a). However, even if it refers to Section 66 (1) (b), no material prejudice has

been caused to the Appellant. Thus, it is not a ground to vary or set aside the Order

of the learned High Court Judge or the learned Magistrate.

Furthermore, it was the contention of the Appellant that the learned High Court

Judge has failed to consider the failure of learned Magistrate in examining and

considering the numerous affidavits and documents tendered to Court as evidence

in favour of the 2nd Party-Petitioner-Appellant as the contents of the documents in

P2c and P2d substantiate the contention of the Appellant.

Apparently, the learned High Court Judge has considered the Order of the learned

Magistrate and found that the learned Magistrate has analyzed and evaluated the

evidence placed before her by both parties and come to the correct finding of facts

and law and determined the matter in terms of Section 68 (3) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act.

It is apparent that after complaining to the Kohuwala Police by way of a fax,

Respondent arrived in Sri Lanka on 02.03.2018 and made a statement to the

Kohuwala Police on the same day against the Appellant regarding the dispute

pertaining to premises bearing No. 24/1, Bandaranayake Mawatha, Kalubowila,

Dehiwala.

It is evident that Respondent had been in possession of the premises since 1991.

When the Respondent left the country, her belongings had been kept inside one

room thereof and the balance part of the premises had been leased out to a person

named Velu Jayakumar when the Respondent was abroad. The Appellant had got the

said lessee Velu Jayakumar to vacate the premises which was leased out and

subsequently the Appellant had entered the disputed portion of the premises on

19.02.2018.

Furthermore, the Respondent had produced documents marked 11 to 112 along

with the first affidavit of the Respondent to establish the possession of the

Respondent to the said premises in dispute. Moreover, the affidavits marked as

Page 6 of 7

114 and 115 given by the lessee said Velu Jayakumar and a relative of the

Respondent substantiated the contention of the Respondent.

It is significant to note that the Appellant had not denied the said Velu Jayakumar

was a lessee of the Respondent or that he was in possession of the disputed premises

till the 19.02.2018.

According to the Lease Agreement 11 (3) (), the Respondent had leased the

premises bearing No. 24/1, Bandaranayake Mawatha, Kalubowila, Dehiwala to the

said Velu Jayakumar from 01.07.2017 to 30.06.2018.

According to the affidavit of the Appellant, the said lessee Velu Jayakumar was in

occupation of the premises in dispute until 19.02.2018 and he had to handover the

premises to the Appellant and vacate the same.

In view of the Judgment Iqbal Vs. Majeudeen and others [1993] 3 SLR 213,

The fact for determining whether a person is in possession of any corporeal

thing, such as a house, is to ascertain whether he is in general control of it.

It was emphasized by Gunwardene, J. that Law recognizes two kinds of possession.

1. When a person has direct physical control over a thing at a given time

Actual Possession.

2. When he, though not in actual possession has both power and intention at

a given time to exercise dominion or control over a thing either directly or

through another personConstructive Possession.

In view of the said Judgment, it clearly manifests that the Respondent had

possession of the disputed premises until 19.02.2018 and it is apparent that

dispossession had taken place on the same day. Admittedly, the Appellant had stated

in his statement to the Kohuwala Police Station that he broke open the padlock of

the store room. Since the Officer in Charge of the Police Station-Kohuwala filed the

information on 29.03.2018, it amply proves that the Respondent was forcibly

dispossessed by the Appellant within a period of two months immediately before the

date on which the information was filed under Section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act.

Page 7 of 7

Thus, the learned Magistrate who was acting as a Primary Court Judge has

determined that Respondent was forcibly dispossessed by the Appellant from the

premises in dispute and the learned Magistrate had directed the Respondent to be

restored to possession and prohibited all disturbances of such possession otherwise

than under the authority of an Order or decree of a competent Court.

Therefore, it is apparent that no injustice was caused to the Appellant by the Order

of the learned Magistrate and no miscarriage of justice occurred.

Hence, no exceptional circumstances exist for the 2nd Party Petitioner-Appellant to

invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Western

Province holden in Colombo.

As such, the learned High Court Judge has correctly dismissed the application of the

2nd Party Petitioner in limine. We see no reason to interfere with the Order dated

04.10.2018 of the learned High Court Judge.

Hence, the appeal is dismissed with cost.
