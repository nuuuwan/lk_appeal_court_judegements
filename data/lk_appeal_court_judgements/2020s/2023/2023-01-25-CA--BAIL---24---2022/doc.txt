MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for bail has been filed to obtain bail for the

suspect under the provisions of the Assistance to and protection of

Victims of Crime and Witness act.

The main contention of the Counsel for the petitioner is that the mother

of the suspect has complained against the suspect for assaulting her over

a family dispute and thereafter he had been arrested and produced

under the instant act in 2019 and he has been in remand ever since

The Counsel appearing for the Respondents stated that the suspect is a

registered criminal and he has several pending cases of similar nature

and the seventy year old mother had been beaten by the suspect many

times before and as such objected for bail being granted, to the suspect.

The law pertaining to the instant act is that if a suspect or an accused is

produced under this act the said suspect or accused can be enlarged on

bail only upon exceptional circumstances.

The law pertaining to the instant matter is that an accused or a suspect

produced under this act, can obtain bail only upon exceptional

circumstances from the Court of Appeal. The term exceptional has not

been defined in the Statute. But the literal meaning of the term is that

something which is out of the ordinary, but as the Statute had not

defined what is out of the ordinary, the cases so far decided have

concluded that what is out of the ordinary is something which depends

on the facts of each case.

In the instant matter the exceptionality urged is the long period of

remand of the suspect without any finality being reached in the case

against him

But in view of the conduct of the suspect it is the opinion of this Court

that it is only but fair to refuse the instant application for bail.

As such the instant application for bail is dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
