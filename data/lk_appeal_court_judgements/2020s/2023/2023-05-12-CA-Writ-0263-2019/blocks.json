Accordingly, it was argued that if the Petitioner did not possess the required qualifications, he should not have been called for the interview and his application should have been rejected in limine. The Petitioner stated that had the Petitioners application been rejected at the inception, he could have applied at a subsequent stage or even applied for other advertised positions. In my view, when the notice sets out the minimum qualifications, it is understood that only those applicants who meet the required qualifications may apply. I agree that the interview board should also have reviewed the petitioner's qualifications at the interview. Yet, in the first place, the Petitioner should not have applied for the position, as he does not meet a criterion enabling him to apply for the position.",
