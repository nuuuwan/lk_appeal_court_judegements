MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioner has invoked the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court under

Article 140 of the Constitution seeking, inter alia, the following main

reliefs;

1. A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and 2nd Respondents to provide

the Petitioner (in joint ownership with the 5th to 58th Respondents)

with 168 hectares of land as promised and provided in documents

dated 12-06-2017 and 25-09-2017 produced marked as P45 and

P47. And in the alternative:

2. A Writ of Certiorari quashing the Indenture of Lease bearing No. 685

dated 03-02-1999 produced as P22.

3. A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and 2nd Respondents to

forthwith place the Petitioner (and 5th to 58th Respondents) in

possession of their entitlements of Rassagala Estate, which has been

identified and demarcated by the 4th Respondent in document dated

20-09-1996 produced as P8. And in the Alternative:

4. A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to pay to the

Petitioner (and 5th to 58th Respondents) the present market value of

their share of Rassagala Estate.

Page 7 of 15

5. A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to pay to the

Petitioner (and 5th to 58th Respondents) the proper value of the rental

for their share of Rassagala Estate from 01-01-1995 to 01-01-2019.

The contention of the Petitioner in a nutshell:

The land, generally referred to as the Rassagala Estate, spanning a total

extent of approximately 2172 Acres 03 Roods and 29 Perches (A2172-R03-

P29) was leased by its owners to the North Sylhet Tea Company Limited

and the South Sylhet Tea Company Limited for 99 years from 01-01-1896

to 31-12-1994. By the indenture of lease No. 2158 dated 19-08-1897

marked as P1 the said lease was assigned to the Consolidated Tea and

Lands Company Limited by the owners. Subsequently, the Consolidated

Tea and Lands Company Limited had been assigned to a Company called

the Ango-American Direct Tea Trading Company Limited. The Ango-

American Direct Tea Trading Company Limited had transferred its

leasehold rights of this Estate to the 1st Respondent (Sri-Lanka State

Plantations Corporation) by deed bearing No. 548 dated 30-12-1971

marked as P4. The Original owner, by deed bearing No. 7150 dated 23-10-

1911 marked as P2 had gifted a portion of this Estate to Ellen

Mahawalatenne Gunasekera, Ezlina Mahawalatenne Ellawala, Jane

Sophia Mahawalatenne Jayawardene, Rosamund Constance

Mahawalatenne and Mabel Augusta Mahawalatenne. It is averred that the

Petitioner and the 5th to 58th Respondents are the descendants of the

aforesaid co-owners. Thereafter, under the provisions of the Land Reform

Law No. 01 of 1972 (as amended) the said Estate was vested with the 4th

Respondent (Land Reform Commission). However, the portion of the

Rassagala Estate owned by the Petitioner and the 5th to 58 Respondents

Page 8 of 15

had not been vested with the Commission as they did not come to the

statutory ceiling for holdings. It is stated that the entire Rassagala Estate

was subject to the said lease agreement. Despite the fact that the said

lease agreement had expired on 31-12-1994, the 1st to 3rd Respondents

failed to hand over the vacant possession of the portion of the said Estate

to the owners, namely the Petitioner and the 5th to 58 Respondents. Thus,

the Petitioner in prayer (e) of the Petition, seeking a mandate in the nature

of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and 2nd Respondents to forthwith

place the Petitioner (and 5th to 58th Respondents) in possession of their

entitlements of Rassagala Estate, which have been identified and

demarcated by the 4th Respondent in a document dated 20-09-1996

produced as P8.

Moreover, it is averred that the Chairman of the 1st Respondent

Corporation by letter dated 12-06-2017 marked as P45 addressed to the

Petitioner consented to give alternative land to the Petitioner and the 5th

to 58th Respondents in lieu of the land purportedly owned by them, and

the Minister of State Plantation Development by letter dated 25-09-2017

marked as P47 addressed to the Chairman State Plantation Corporation,

recommending to give alternative land to the Petitioner and the 5th to 58th

Respondents. As such, the Petitioner, in prayer (c) of the Petition, is

seeking a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and 2nd Respondents to

provide the Petitioner and the 5th to 58th Respondents with 168 hectares

of land as promised in P45 and P47 on the basis of a legitimate

expectation. The Petitioner further states that the 1st Respondent by the

lease agreement No. 685 dated 03-02-1999 marked as P22, leased the

Rassagala Estate to Balangoda Plantation Limited for a period of 53 years,

commencing from 11-06-1992 which is bad in law, and therefore, in prayer

(d) of the Petition the Petitioner is praying for a Writ of Certiorari to quash

Page 9 of 15

the said lease agreement. In the alternative, in prayers (f) and (g) the

Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to

pay to the Petitioner and the 5th to 58 Respondents the Present market

value and the rental for their share of Rassagala Estate from 01-01-1995

to 01-01-2019.

The contention of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 59th Respondents (contesting

Respondents).

The 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 59th Respondents, in their objections, took up the

position that;

1. The 1st Respondent, by the deed of transfer bearing No. 548 dated

30-12-1971 marked as 1R1 purchased the Rassagala Estate from

the Anglo American Tea Trading Company, and thereafter, leased the

said estate to Balangoda Plantations by deed No. 685 dated 08-02-

1999 for a period of 53 years, which is marked as 1R2. It is averred

in the objection that the land claimed by the Petitioner and the 5th to

58th Respondents is not a part of the land which is the subject matter

of the deed marked 1R1.

Having scrutinized the averments of the Petition, it is abundantly clear

that the land purportedly claimed by the Petitioner was not vested with

the 4th Respondent (LRC) and the same remains as private land. As such,

the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents have no obligation in law to provide

alternative land to the Petitioner. As the land in dispute was admittedly

not vested with the LRC, there is no lawful basis to promise to provide

alternative land. Hence, it is the view of this Court that there is no value

attached to the aforesaid documents marked as P45 and P47, and

therefore, the Petitioner is precluded from claiming alternative land on the

ground of legitimate expectation based on P45 and P47.

Page 10 of 15

What is legitimate expectation? This concept is focused upon the idea of

fairness and the enforcement of promises or representations. This

principle creates the idea that it is unlawful for a public authority to fail

to abide by a promise or representation that it has made without good

reason, provided that the promise is lawful and that whoever made the

promise was entitled to bind the authority.

In Junaideen Mohamed Iqbal vs. The Divisional Secretary,

Kundasale1, the Court of Appeal simply described the principle of

legitimate expectation as follows:

When a public authority represents that it will or will not do

something within its authority and later attempts to rescind the said

representation, a person who has reasonably relied on it should be

entitled to enforce it by law. This concept is based on the principles of

natural justice and fairness, and seeks to prevent the abuse of power

by public authorities

Wade discusses the principle of legitimate expectations2 as follows:

A further and more satisfactory reason for the protection of

legitimate expectations lie in the trust that has been reposed by the

citizen in what he has been told or led to believe by the official. Good

government depends upon trust between the governed and the

governor. Unless that trust is sustained and protected officials will not

be believed and the government becomes a choice between chaos and

coercion. It is not enough that an expectation should exist: it must

in addition be legitimate. But how is it to be determined whether a

particular expectation is worthy of protection? This is a difficult area

1 CA/Writ/328/215/CA-Minutes of 19/2/2020. 2 H.W.R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth, Administrative Law, 11th Edition, p.451

Page 11 of 15

since an expectation reasonably entertained by a person may not be

found to be legitimate because of some countervailing consideration of

policy or law. A crucial requirement is that the assurance must itself

be clear, unequivocal and unambiguous. Many claimants fail at this

hurdle after a close analysis of the assurance. The test is how on a

fair reading of the promise it would have been reasonably understood

by those to whom it was made. (Page 452)

The meaning and scope of the doctrine of legitimate expectation were

considered at length in Union of India vs. Hindustan Development

Corporation3, where it was stated that,

Time is a three-fold present: the present as we experience it, the past

as a present memory, and the future as a present expectation. For

legal purposes, the expectation cannot be the same as anticipation. It

is different from a wish, desire, or hope nor can it amount to a claim

or demand on the ground of a right. However, earnest and sincere a

wish, a desire or a hope may be and however confidently one may

look to them to be fulfilled, they by themselves cannot amount to an

assertable expectation and a mere disappointment does not attract

legal consequences. A pious hope even leading to a moral obligation

cannot amount to a legitimate expectation. The legitimacy of an

expectation can be inferred only if it is founded on the sanction of law

or custom or an established procedure followed in a regular and

natural sequence. Again it is distinguishable from a genuine

expectation. Such expectations should be justifiable, legitimate and

protectable. Every such legitimate expectation does not by itself

3 1994 AIR 988, 1993 (3) SCC 499.

Page 12 of 15

fructify into a right and, therefore, it does not amount to a right in a

conventional sense.4

When applying the above-stated principles to the instant Application, the

question that begs an answer is whether a promise or an assurance that

was given by the Respondents to the Petitioner to provide alternative land

is lawful. It is pertinent to note that the promise given in P45 and P47 is

not lawful as the land in suit was not vested with the LRC. Similarly, the

expectation of the Petitioner for an alternative land is not legitimate as he

was fully aware of the fact that the land claimed by him was not vested. In

these circumstances, the Petitioner is not entitled to the relief as prayed

for in paragraph (c) of the Petition.

Besides, the Petitioner contends that, after the expiry of the lease

agreement, the 1st Respondent failed and neglected to hand over the vacant

possession of the land claimed by him, and therefore, seeking a mandate

in the nature of Writ of Certiorari directing the 1st and 2nd Respondents to

place the Petitioner and the 5th to 58th Respondents in the subject matter.

It is trite law that, upon the termination of the lease agreement, in the

event of failure on the part of the lessee to hand over the vacant possession

of the subject matter, the lessor is entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of the

District Court for the ejectment of the lessee. Similarly, the relief, seeking

to quash the lease agreement marked as P22 as well should be determined

in the District Court which is vested with original civil jurisdiction. In these

circumstances, it appears to this Court that, instead of invoking the

alternative remedy provided in law, seeking prerogative Writs which is a

discretionary remedy provided in law, is untenable.

4 Vide para 28 of the judgment.

Page 13 of 15

Prerogative Writs are discretionary remedies, and therefore, the Petitioner

is not entitled to invoke the Writ jurisdiction of this Court when there is

an alternative remedy available to him. In Linus Silva Vs. The University

Council of Vidyodaya University5 it was observed that the remedy by

way of certiorari is not available where an alternative remedy is open to

the petitioner is subject to the limitation that the alternative remedy must

be an adequate remedy. The Court of Appeal in Tennakoon Vs. The

Director-General of Customs6 held that the petitioner has an alternate

remedy, as the Customs Ordinance itself provides for such a course of

action under section 154. In the circumstances, the petitioner is not

entitled to invoke writ jurisdiction.

Moreover, it is to be noted that the 1st Respondent is claiming title to the

land in dispute by a deed of transfer marked as 1R1. The Petitioner and

the 5th to 58th Respondents are claiming title to a portion of the said Estate

as descendants of the donees in P2. It is to be noted that the Petitioner

has not submitted a comprehensive pedigree to establish his devolution of

title. The Petitioner's name is not mentioned in P8 as well. As the title to

the subject matter is in dispute, the Petitioner will have to invoke the civil

jurisdiction of the District Court for the determination of his title either by

way of a Re-vindicatio action or action for declaration of title. It is settled

law that a petitioner is not entitled to seek a Writ of Mandamus where his

right to the subject matter is questionable.

The original civil jurisdiction to decide the title of the parties to the land in

dispute, to handover the possession of the subject matter to the Petitioner

by ejecting the 1st Respondent from the corpus and to revoke the lease

5 64 NLR 104 6 2004 (1) SLR 53

Page 14 of 15

agreement marked as P22, is vested with the District Court which

exercises the original civil jurisdiction. As the facts are in dispute and the

identification of the subject matter is an issue, the oral and documentary

evidence is to be led before the trial Court for an appropriate adjudication,

and therefore, the instant Application is misconceived in law.

In this regard, I refer to the judgment of Thajudeen Vs. Sri-Lanka Tea

Board7 where the Court of Appeal held that;

Where the major facts are in dispute and the legal result of the facts

is subject to controversy and it is necessary that the questions should

be canvassed in a suit where parties would have ample opportunity

of examining the witnesses so that the Court would be better able to

judge which version is correct, a Writ will not issue. Mandamus is pre-

eminently a discretionary remedy. It is an extraordinary, residuary

and suppletory remedy to be granted only when there are no other

means of obtaining justice. Even though all other requirements for

securing the remedy have been satisfied by the applicant, the Court

will decline to exercise its discretion in his favour if a specific

alternative remedy like a regular action equally convenient, beneficial,

and effective is available.

Thus, I hold that the Petitioner is not entitled to the reliefs as prayed for

in paragraphs (d) and (e) as well.

Furthermore, I observe that the reliefs as prayed for in paragraphs (f) and

(g), seeking Writs of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to pay the

Petitioner and the 5th to 58th Respondents the present market value of

their share of Rassagala Estate and the rental from 01-01-1995 to 01-01-

7 1981(2)SLR-471.

Page 15 of 15

2019 do not arise since admittedly the subject matter had not been vested

with the LRC.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Petitioners Application is

misconceived in law and facts, thus, the Application is dismissed. No

costs.

Application dismissed.
