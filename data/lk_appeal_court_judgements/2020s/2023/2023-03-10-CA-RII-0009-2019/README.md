Judgment

Although notices have been sent to the respondents, on several occasions,

through registered post and through the Fiscal of Nugegoda for those whose

addresses were in that area, none of them have come to Court. This was the

situation on earlier occasions too. In the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated

08.07.2005, in C. A. 1221/2002, a revision application made by the present

petitioner, the 17B defendant, the Court said,

3 | R I I 0 9 2 0 1 9 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 1 0 t h M a r c h 2 0 2 3

Notices were issued on several occasions and only the 5th and the 6th

defendant respondents were represented by counsel. Though a date was

obtained to file objections the counsel for the 5th and 6th defendant

respondents indicated to Court that they were not filing objections. In the

circumstances no objections have been filed opposing this application.

Hence, from 2002 at least, for twenty years and mostly from 1989, the date of

the judgment, for 33 years, any contest for the unallotted shares the petitioner

claimed was with the Court only.

Hence this Court fixed the application for hearing and making this judgment.

The plaintiff has instituted case No. 12128/P of District Court of Panadura on

30.06.1970, under Partition Act No. 16 of 1951. The 17th defendant, K. Richard

Perera has tendered his statement of claims on 21.10.1971. The judgment has

been pronounced on 26.10.1989, after 19 years, by the learned Additional

District Judge of Panadura according to which the estate of Richard, who was

dead by then, was allotted 14982/129600 shares. The judgment also kept

unalloted a share of 47450/129600. Judgment marked as P.3.

The 17B defendant and her sister, Kopiyawattage Deelin Perera have made an

application seeking to allot from the said unallotted share. Since, the dates on

which four applications for allocation [by other parties too] from unallotted shares

were made is not stated, it is not clear as to what happened from 1989 to 2002.

By order dated 04.03.2002, the learned district judge dismissed the applications

of the petitioner and several others. Order marked as P.4.

The 17B defendant has preferred an appeal bearing No. C. A. 1221/2002 to the

Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal by judgment dated 08.07.2005 setting

aside the part of P.4 relating to the 17B defendant and further directed the

learned district judge to hold an inquiry with notice to the other parties

expeditiously. (Andrew Somawansa J. and Wimalachandra J.) Judgment marked as P.5.

4 | R I I 0 9 2 0 1 9 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 1 0 t h M a r c h 2 0 2 3

The learned District Judge, making an order dated 10.09.2007, held that

although Richards estate was allotted 14982/129600, the estate should have

been allotted 14036/86400 share whereas Richards sister Nanso (Nancy Perera)

should be allotted 7018/86400. The said order further said, that, 14982/129600

share allotted to the estate of Richard should be correctly allotted as follows,

To K. Deelin Perera - 7491/259200

To 17B defendant K. Nandawathie Perera - 7491/259200 + 7491/259200

= 22473/259200,

making the inclusion of those shares in the judgment. Order marked as P.7.

The said order also held that since deed No. 6372 dated 11.02.1964 (2D.1) has

not been produced the Court cannot come to a decision in respect of devolution

of title on deed Pe.4 and hence no order is made in respect of Nancy Pereras

rights.

The 17B defendant then sought to invoke the inherent powers of the district

court under section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code. In respect of this application

the subsequent learned District Judge made order dated 25.11.2013.

The said order determined, that, 17B defendants claim is twofold, viz.,

(a) Nancy Pereras share - 7018/86400

(b) the additional share of Richard which was based on an error of calculation

which is - 12144/259200 (14036/86400 - 14982/129600)

The said learned District Judge was of the view, that, the petitioner, without

appealing the order P.7 is trying to question it by indirect means and dismissed

the application under section 839 aforesaid. It is the decision of this Court, that,

the application under section 839 was not such an application, but, an

5 | R I I 0 9 2 0 1 9 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 1 0 t h M a r c h 2 0 2 3

application the petitioner could have made, in the circumstances, to bring it to

the notice of the district court, that, she is entitled to a share from the unallotted

share. The said order dated 25.11.2013 is marked as P.16.

The same learned District Judge who wrote P.16, has approved by journal entry

dated 04.06.2014, the amended interlocutory decree.

Mr. Gamini D. Peiris, L. S., made plan No. 2907 dated 05.04.2015, which

depicted only the unallotted shares. Subsequently plan No. 3035 dated

22.04.2016 was made.

Since, there were some discrepancies in the said plan the 17B defendant filed a

motion dated 29.06.2016. A petition and affidavit were filed on 04.07.2016. The

learned District Judge who has assumed duties after the learned district judge

finally referred to made order dated 19.01.2017. The 17B defendant petitioner

contends that this order is perverse and bad in law.

The learned District Judge in his order stated that after former learned District

Judge Mr. K. S. Gunethilake, on 29.01.1992 allotted 2420/129600 share to the

6th defendant, the unallotted share should be 45030/129600 and thereafter no

party has been allotted any share from the unallotted share. He further stated

that as per the order dated 10.09.2007 (P.7), 17B defendants share is

11236.5/129600 and 17C defendants share is 3745.5/129600. The order

marked as P.22.

Hence, the learned District Judge having revoked the amended interlocutory

decree, further directed that (i) the 17B defendant shall bear the entire expense

of the Final Plan (ii) the Final Plan and report to be set aside and (iii) the 17B

defendant herself to tender the correct interlocutory decree as per which the

land has to be partitioned. This Court sees that there was no reason to punish

the 17B defendant, who was only trying to get a share allocated to her, which

remained unallocated also, at least partly, due to the fault of the court itself.

6 | R I I 0 9 2 0 1 9 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 1 0 t h M a r c h 2 0 2 3

Hence although P.22 is not in the spirit in it should have been made, because,

the 17B defendant petitioner has by adducing documentary evidence on two

days of inquiry held before the learned predecessor district judge who made order

P.7, has shown, as to how she gets the share, although the said learned district

judge who made P.7, thought, her hands are tied by the share allotted to the 17th

defendant Richard by the judgment in 1989, despite ordering a certain

correction referred to above be included in the judgment, on the whole the

statement that nothing was allotted after Mr. K. S. Gunethilakes order in 1992,

in respect of the 6th defendant, is correct.

The 17B defendant appealed by leave to appeal application bearing No.

WP/HCCA/ KAL/ 06 2017 LA, for which leave was granted on 4 questions and

by its judgment, the said Civil Appellate High Court dismissed the appeal

directing the learned District Judge to enter interlocutory decree as per the 1989

judgment (P.3) and also setting aside the aforesaid orders dated P.7 and P.16.

Judgement is marked as P.27.

Among other things, the 17B defendant petitioner argues that, the said orders

P.7 and P.16 emanates from holding of inquiries subsequent to the direction of

the ....Court of Appeal in revision application bearing No. C. A. 1221/2002

(marked as P.5) and therefore by setting aside, the said orders P. 7 and P. 16,

the Hon. Judges of the Provincial High Court exceeded the jurisdiction conferred

upon them.

The 17B defendants claim is basically from Richard, her father, son of William

and who in turn was a son of K. Davith Perera, one of the original owners who

had a share of undivided 11/12th and also from Nanso alias Nancy Perera, a

sister of Richard and the aunt of 17B defendant.

It is pertinent to examine as to how shares were devolved upon, before

considering whether the 17B defendant petitioner has established how much of

a share should be allocated to him. This needs a pedigree to be drawn, a copy of

which pedigree prepared by me is attached to this judgment.

7 | R I I 0 9 2 0 1 9 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 1 0 t h M a r c h 2 0 2 3

It is not necessary, for the purpose of this judgment, to examine the entire

pedigree as no shares come to Richard or Nanso from the other original owner,

Michohamy, who owned an undivided 1/12th share.

The petitioner claims through K. Davith Perera, who owned 11/12th as aforesaid

who had six children and Richard and Nanso were the children of one of the

children of Davith called William.

The pedigree accepted at the trial has only a few variations from that was pleaded

in the plaint dated 30.06.1970. Davith, one of the original owners dies and his

11/12th share devolves upon his six children (1) Jamis (2) William (3) Salmon (4)

Mailentina (5) Francina and (6) Bastian. Each of them get 11/72th share. Jamis

dies leaving a widow, but no children and 11/144 goes to the widow Angage

Caroline Perera. The balance 11/144 devolves upon five of his siblings (1) William

(2) Salmon (3) Milentina (4) Francina and (5) Bastian in 11/720 shares. Bastian

transfers his share by deed No. 9343 dated 12.01.1931 (1D.1) to Francina, who

gets 11/72 + 11/72 + 11/720 + 11/720 = 242/720. Francina dies unmarried,

intestate and issueless and this share (242/720) in turn goes to (1) the widow of

Jamis (2) William (3) Salmon (4) Mailentina and (5) Bastian in 242/3600 shares

each.

It is said in P.7, that 242/3600 Jamis gets, goes to his widow 242/7200 share

and the balance 272/7200 to his siblings (1) William (2) Salmon (3) Mailentina

and (4) Bastians estate in 242/28800 share each. But, this cannot happen,

because, in calculating Francinas share as 242/720, the share she gets

from Jamis (11/720) has been added and Jamis cannot be resurrected to

inherit from Francina again. What goes from Francina in respect of Jamis is

only for latters widow as an heir in place of Jamis.

Hence Williams share is calculated as follows, (a) paternal inheritance from

Davith 11/72 + (b) inheritance from Jamis 11/720 [the total of (a) and (b) = 121/720]

and not another 242/28800 from Jamis again. Calculations were made in P.7

on this basis and it is stated that William gets a total share of 7018/28800. The

8 | R I I 0 9 2 0 1 9 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 1 0 t h M a r c h 2 0 2 3

last mentioned 242/28800 will not come to William. Hence Williams share is (a)

and (b) above + (c) inheritance from Francina, which is, 242/3600, that is,

121/720 + 242/3600 = 847/3600 share. Since shares were calculated, at this

stage, taking the common denominator as 28800, if this is given in that version,

it is 6776/28800 share.

William has children (1) 16th defendant Tuwinis (2) 17th defendant Richard (3)

19th defendant Nanso (4) Podisingho alias Francis and (5) Thiriyas. William has

transferred 11/60th of his title to Thiriyas on deed No 5683 dated 21.02.1940

(17D.1). P.7 says that this 11/60th is equal to 5280/28800. But 6776/28800 x

11/60 is 74536/1728000 share or 9317/216000. Therefore the share William

has at his death is 847/3600 which is 50820/216000 [multiplied by 60] and when

9317/216000 is deducted, the balance share is 41503/216000.

This is the share that devolves on Williams children (1) Thiriyas (2) Tuwinis (3)

Richard (4) Nanso and (5) Francis. Each of them gets 41503/1080000. Hence

Richard and Nanso originally get 41503/1080000 each.

Thiriyass share on 17D.1 is 9317/216000 share. On paternal inheritance he

gets 41503/1080000. The total is 46585 + 41503/1080000 = 88088/1080000 =

11011/135000 share. Thiriyas dies unmarried, intestate and issueless leaving

(1) Tuwinis (2) Richard (3) Nanso and (4) Francis. Hence they in addition gets

11011/540000 share each.

Hence Richards share is 41503/1080000 + 11011/540000 =

41503+22022/1080000 = 63525/1080000 = 12705/216000 share.

There is one more addition. Williams son Francis dies unmarried, intestate and

issueless. His share which is 12705/216000 devolves on (1) Tuwinis (2) Richard

and (3) Nanso in 12705/648000 share each.

Richard now gets 41503/1080000 + 11011/540000 =12705/216000 +

12705/648000 = 38115 +12705/648000 = 50820/648000 = 10164/129600.

9 | R I I 0 9 2 0 1 9 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 1 0 t h M a r c h 2 0 2 3

Tuwinis who has the same share which is 10164/129600 has transferred it on

deed No. 7249 dated 01.08.1968 to Dharmadasa Sandanayake who transferred

the same to Tuwinis Perera again on deed No. 7369/08.04.1969 who by deed

No. 7405 dated 08.08.1969 transferred the same to Richard.

Hence Richard gets 10164/129600 + 10164/129600 = 20328/129600.

This is the share that devolves on the petitioner and her sister.

Hence Richards share is (a) paternal inheritance 41503/1080000 + (b)

inheritance from Thiriyas 11011/540000 which is 12705/216000 + (c)

inheritance from Francis 12705/648000 + (d) on deed No. 7405 dated

08.08.1969 from Tuwinis 10164/129600 = 20328/129600.

It will be seen that even in 1989, after 19 years of the institution of the partition

action also shares were given taking the common denominator as 129600. Now

it is 52 years from the institution of this case. From 1989 to 2022, the period

taken for this calculation is 33 years.

The judgment in 1989 allocated to Richards estate a share of 14982/129600.

The learned additional district judge has said that she is not calculating Francis

share. It was alleged that there was a miscalculation of the share even without

Franciss share too. The entire share for Richard is 20328/129600. Since

14982/129600 share has been already allocated the newly allocated share is

5346/129600.

Nansos share remain unallotted even in P.7. Nanso gets, (a) on paternal

inheritance 41503/1080000 + (b) inheritance from Thiriyas 11011/540000 and

(c) inheritance from Francis 12705/648000 the total of which is 41503 +

22022/1080000 + 12705/648000 = 12705/216000 + 12705/648000 =

50820/648000 = 10164/129600.

Nanso has transferred 11/450 of her entitlement on deed No. 6372 (2D.1) to the

2nd defendant Leelawathie Perera. The said Leelawathie Perera has transferred

that share on deed No. 21569 dated 07.02.2000 to the petitioner. The petitioner

10 | R I I 0 9 2 0 1 9 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 1 0 t h M a r c h 2 0 2 3

with her application dated 17.05.2012 produced 2D.1 as X.2 and the latter deed

as X.4. Nanso has also transferred her remaining title by deed No. 1189 dated

06.11.1978 to the petitioner which was produced as X.3. The petitioner submits

that Nansos share is 7018/86400. Her share 10164/129600 in terms of the said

denominator will be 6776/86400, a little less, because, the error in Jamiss

inheritance being calculated twice was corrected in this judgment1. But

substantially Richard as well as Nanso gets a larger share than given in 1989

judgment and whereas the new addition to Richards share was stated afore,

although deed No. 1189 (X.2) and deed No. 21569 (X.3) are subject to the Final

Decree to be entered in the said partition action, it is directed that the entire

share of Nanso [who is correctly Mrs. Nancy Perera, since Nanso undoubtedly is a kind of pet name]

which is 10164/129600 be stated in the Amended Interlocutory Decree to be

entered, as allotted to the petitioner and her sister, referring in the I/D 2D.1, X.2

and X.3 against the name of the petitioner and her siter, because, if those shares,

which in any event goes to the petitioner and her sister were to be mentioned in

the ordinary manner further mistakes, that will take several more years can be

occurred. It is well to remember, that allocation of shares, which includes

allocation of them from the unallotted shares must be done always having

the aid of a correct pedigree and the courts must take a realistic approach

in doing so, not forgetting that, so many people in a pedigree to have died

unmarried and issueless [in this case there were Francina, Thiriyas and Francis] is often a

mere creation of proctors [presently registered attorneys-at-law] or their clerks.

Especially, partition actions in the District Courts such as of Tangalla,

Matara, Galle, Kalutara, Panadura and Horana have somewhat complex

pedigrees. This case does not have a very complex pedigree. Had the

Judges, who handled this case, took this duty upon themselves [of drawing the

pedigree] at least the second lap of thirty three years could have been greatly

reduced. Unallotted shares are kept unallotted for the purpose of allotting

later on proof of title and applications for allocation of unallotted shares

1 This slightly reduces Williams share [Nansos father] and hence Nansos share.

should not take the form of a contest between the court and such an

applicant.

This Court decides the above, exercising its jurisdiction on restitutio in integrum

and revision. The latter is not invoked by the petitioner, but the Court invokes

revisionary powers ex mero motu. In respect of the former, restitutio in integrum,

Ranasinghe J., (as he then was) in the minority of a Seven Judge Bench of the

Supreme Court in Mrs. Vivionne Gunawardena vs. Hector Perera, Officer in

Charge, Police Station, Kollupitiya and others S.C. Application 20/1983

referred to the case of Menchinahamy v. Muniweera, (1950) 52 NLR 409

decided by Dias S. P. J., to say that the Supreme Court of Ceylon [when that Court

had the power of restitutio in integrum] has exercised it even to correct a mistake of the

Supreme Court itself.

Ranasinghe J., referring to the judgment of Menchinahamy vs. Muniweera

(1950) 52 NLR 409, while being on the minority will not diminish its value. It

shows how the then Supreme Court, exercised the power of restitutio in

integrum, even against a judgment of its own. Today, such a power is vested,

hence, not only under Article 138 of the Constitution, but also empirically, so

to say, in the arrangement of the powers of Courts, in the present Court of

Appeal.

Menchinahamy vs. Muniweera was referred to by Fernando J., in the judgment

of His Lordship in the Five Judge Bench of the Supreme Court [Justices Amerasinghe,

Dheeraratne, Goonewardene and Wadugodapitiya concurring] in Amerajeewa vs. University of

Colombo (1993) 1993 (2) SLR 327.

As for revision, In the case of In Re the insolvency of Hayman Thornhill

(1895) 2 NLR 105, discussing the scope and object of the exercise of revisionary

powers by the Supreme Court Sir Winfield Bonser C.J. stated as follows: "The

Supreme Court has the power of revising the proceedings of all inferior courts.

This power .... The object at which the Supreme Court aims in exercising its

powers of revision is the due administration of justice; and whether any

particular person has complained against an order; proposed to be revised, or is

prejudiced by it, is not to be taken into account in the exercise of such power."

Presently, the said power is vested in the Court of Appeal.

Exercising the above powers this Court sets aside orders P.22 and P.27. The

orders P.7 and P.16 are restored, however, subject to this judgment. The learned

district judge is directed to amend the I/D as follows,

(i) Taking the share of Richard as 20328/129600,

(ii) Since Richard was given in the judgment a share of 14982/129600,

Richards heirs [the petitioner and her sister] are to be given another

5346/129600 shares from the unallotted share of 47450/129600 or

whatever remains from it presently,

(iii) Since Nansos share was not allotted by P.7 and as directed in this

judgment in respect of 2D.1, X.2 and X.3, the said share vests in the

petitioner and her sister, the said share 10164/129600, also to be given

to them deducting from the unallotted share of 47450/129600 or

whatever remains from it presently,

(iv) The decisions in the judgment of the learned additional district judge

dated 26.10.1989, pertaining to the shares of Richard and Nanso must

be understood subject to this judgment

Having entered the amended I/D the learned district judge will direct the relevant

surveyor to effect the required corrections, in the final plan already made, or if

necessary, by making a fresh plan [expenses to be incurred pro rata] and take steps for

final partition.

Richard died before seeing the judgment in 1989. Let his childrens children at
