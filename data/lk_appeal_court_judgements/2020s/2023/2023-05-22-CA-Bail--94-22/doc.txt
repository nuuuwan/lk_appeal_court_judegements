BAIL ORDER

P.Kumararatnam,J.

The Petitioner filing this Application has invoked the jurisdiction of this

Court to grant bail to him upon suitable condition as this Court

considers appropriate.

The Petitioner is the 28th Suspect in the case bearing No.

B/35602/01/20 of the Magistrate Court of Colombo. After his arrest he

was placed under a detention order from 24/08/2020 to 28/06/2021.

According to the B report filed, the Petitioner was arrested as there were

justifiable reasons for suspecting committing an offence and/or

abetting to commit offences under Section 54(a), (b) of the Poisons,

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act No. 13 of 1984 as amended and

under Sections 2(1) (a) (b) (c) (d), 03 (a) of the Prevention of Terrorism

(Temporary Provisions) Act No.48 of 1979.

It was further mentioned that upon information provided by the

Petitioner, two T56 weapons, two pistols, four T56 magazines of

weapons, 82 number 7.62 live bullets, 39 number of 9mm live bullets,

CA BAL 94-2022

11 KG 888.256 grams of Heroin and two electronic scales had been

recovered by the Criminal Investigation Department.

The vehicle bearing number SP-CAK-8628 arrested along with the

Petitioner also had been sent to the Government Analysts Department.

The production had been sent to the Government Analyst Department

and after analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded the report to

Court on 10/09/2021. According to the Government Analyst, 7895.5

grams of pure Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) and 18.8 grams of Morphine

had been detected from the substance sent for the analysis. In addition,

traces of Heroin had been detected in the electronic scales.

The Counsel appearing for the Petitioner contended that there are 32

suspects so far produced under this case and among them 1st to 13th,

16th to 17th and 19th ,20th to 27th suspects were granted bail by the

Court. Further, 18th and 29th suspects were discharged and 14th,19th

and 32nd suspects have gone abroad. 30th suspect has not furnished

bail while 31st suspect is in remand for a different offence. Now,

pertaining to this case only the Petitioner and 15th suspect are in

remand.

Although the Petitioner had filed a bail application in the High Court of

Colombo, the Learned High Court Judge had dismissed the same on the

premise that the jurisdiction to grant bail is now vested with the Court

of Appeal as per the amended Act No. 41 of 2022 of the Poison, Opium

and Dangerous Drugs Act.

The Petitioner has a previous conviction relating to Cannabis and has a

pending case before the High Court of Tangalle.

The contention of the Respondents is that as the instant investigation

revolves around large scale trafficking of narcotic substance and illicit

weapons. Therefore, this application should be dismissed.

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in

support of his Bail Application.

1. The Petitioner has been detained under a detention order from

24/08/2020 to 28/06/2021 where he has been remanded up to

the date of filling this application for more than two years and

four months without indictment being served on him.

2. Almost all the suspects are released on bail including the main

suspect of this case.

3. The one and only evidence against the Petitioner is the recoveries

made under Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance.

4. The Respondents have failed to seek extension of remand custody

of the Petitioner under Section 85 of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 41 of 2022.

5. All most all the other evidence are statements made by co-

suspects of this case. Hence, they are inadmissible against the

Petitioner unless corroborated by an independent witness.

6. There is no cogent evidence to proceed with the Petitioner under

the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

The Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the suspect is in remand for

more than two years. Considering the facts and the circumstances of

this case, that the prosecution will not be able to establish a prima facie

case against the Petitioner. Further, the Counsel submits that the

Respondents have failed to seek extension of remand custody of the

Petitioner under Section 85 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 41 of 2022.

According to the Learned Deputy Solicitor General, the Petitioner had

been indicted in the High Court of Galle and the indictment is due to be

served on him. According to the DSG, the Petitioner is indicted for

possession and trafficking of 7805.5 grams of Heroin and possession

and trafficking of 18.8 grams of Morphine punishable under the

CA BAL 94-2022

5 | P a g e

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, possession of two

T56 guns and two pistols punishable under the Firearms Ordinance

and possession of 121 live bullets punishable under the Explosive Act.

Hence, Learned DSG submitted that the delay is not an exceptional

circumstance to be considered to enlarge the suspect on bail. Further,

the DGS submits that the time spent for preparing the indictment does

not constitute an exceptional circumstance.

The Section 83 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act

which was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states:

83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under

sections 54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail

by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 84 and 85, a person

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A

and section 54B-

(a) of which the pure quantity of the dangerous drug, trafficked,

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A;

and

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment,

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in

exceptional circumstances.

(3) For the purpose of this section dangerous drug means Morphine,

Cocaine, Heroin and Methamphetamine.

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what

is exceptional circumstances must be considered on its own facts and

circumstances on a case by case.

CA BAL 94-2022

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts

and circumstances.

In Labynidarage Nishanthi v. Attorney General CA (PHC) APN

48/2014 the court held that:

It is trite law that any accused or suspect having charged under

the above act will be admitted to bail only in terms of section 83(1)

of the said Act and it is only on exceptional circumstances.

Nevertheless, it is intensely relevant to note, the term Exceptional

circumstances has not been explained or defined in any of the

Statutes. Judges are given a wide discretion in deciding in what

creates a circumstance which is exceptional in nature.

There is plethora of cases in the legal parlor which had identified

what creates an exceptional circumstances in relation to granting

bail

The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner contended that the Petitioner

has been detained under a detention order from 24/08/2020 to

28/06/2021 where he has been remanded up to the date of filling this

application for more than two years and four months without

indictment being served on him.

Period in remand custody cannot be considered as an exceptional

circumstance in all case. It has to be decided on a case-by-case basis to

consider whether the remand period already spent could be considered

as an exceptional circumstance.

In Ashani Dhanushshika v. Attorney General [CA (PHC) APN

04/2016] the court held that:

In the present case the petitioner failed to establish any

exceptional circumstances warranting this court to exercise

the revisionary jurisdiction. The petitioners first point is that

the suspect is in remand nearly for two years. The intention

of the legislature is to keep in remand any person who is

suspected or accused of possessing or trafficking heroin until

the conclusion of the case. The Section 83(1) of the Act

expresses the intention of the legislature

In Carder v. Officer-in-Charge, Narcotics Bureau (2006) 3 SLR 74

the court held that:

Provision has been made in the Bail Act to release

persons on bail if the period of remand extends more than 12

months. No such provision is found in the case of Poison,

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. Although bail was

granted in some of the cases mentioned above, none of these

cases refer to the time period in remand as constituting an

exceptional circumstance. Hence bail cannot be considered

on that ground alone.

According to the decisions cited above, the period spent in the remand

custody cannot be considered as an exceptional circumstance in this

case.

Further, the Counsel for the Petitioner contended that as the

prosecution will not succeed in securing a conviction against the

Petitioner due to the presentation of inadmissible evidence against the

Petitioner. Hence, he strenuously argued that the Appellant should be

released on bail.

CA BAL 94-2022

8 | P a g e

I am not inclined to accept this argument as a suspect can only be

released on bail under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act as

amended upon successful demonstration of that he has exceptional

circumstances to be released on bail.

Further, facts of a case do not constitute exceptional circumstances.

Issues pertaining to the case should only be considered at the trial

stage.

In the case of A.K.Nandasena v. The Attorney General [CA(PHC) APN

147/2017 the court held that:

that facts of a case do not constitute exceptional

circumstances and such issues need to be addressed at the

trial stage.

In The Attorney General v. Madapathage Dona Thilaka alias

Shyamali [SC Appeal 53/2021] decided on 30/11/2022, His Lordship

Thurairaja, PC, J. held that:

Therefore, under these circumstances, no material is before

the Court of Appeal to come to a decision regarding if the

witness is creditworthy, nor is it relevant to the granting of

bail in this application in the first place. Hence, it cannot be

considered as an exceptional ground in considering an

application for revision.

Hence, the facts of the case will not be addressed in considering this

bail application.

The Counsel for the Petitioner argued that the Respondents have failed

to seek extension of remand custody of the Petitioner under Section 85

of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 41 of

2022.

CA BAL 94-2022

9 | P a g e

This is a clearly a wrong submission of the scope and ambit of Section

of 83(2) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as

amended by Amendment Act No. 41 of 2022. The new amended Section

83(2) very clearly excluded the Sections 84 and 85 of the Poisons,

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act when a bail application of a person

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of Sections 54A

and 54B are considered.

In this case the pure quantity of the Heroin detected in the production

by the Government Analyst is 7895.5 grams and the pure quantity of

the Morphine is 18.8 grams. Further, he had been indicted for

possession of two T56 weapons, Two pistols and ammunitions.

Considering the pure quantity of the Heroin and the Morphine detected

in this case, if convicted, the Petitioner will either be sentenced to death

or life imprisonment. Similar sentence has also been prescribed for

possession of T56 guns. Considering the gravity of the offences

committed, there is a high risk of absconding.

Further, the delay more than two years in remand does not fall into the

category of excessive and oppressive delay considering the

circumstances of this case as the offences committed under Section

54A(b) and 54A(c) of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 and Act No. 41 of 2022

and under Section 22(3) of the Firearms Ordinance are serious offences.

In Ranil Charuka Kulatunga v. Attorney General [CA(PHC) APN

134/2015] the court held that:

the quantity of cocaine involved in this case is 62.847

grams, which is a commercial quantity. If Petitioner is

convicted, the punishment is death or life imprisonment.

Under these circumstances, it is prudent to conclude the trial

early while the petitioner is kept in custody.

CA BAL 94-2022

Considering all the materials placed before this court, the Petitioner has

failed to adduce that he has exceptional ground/s to free him on bail.

Hence, this bail application is refused.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this order to the

Director, Criminal Investigation Department and the High Court of

Gampaha.
