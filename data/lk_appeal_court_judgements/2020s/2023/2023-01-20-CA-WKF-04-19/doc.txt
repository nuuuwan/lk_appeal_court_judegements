MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. The Respondent-Appellant-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as Appellants)

preferred this appeal against the Order of the Wakf Tribunal of Sri Lanka

dated 16.02.2019 in case bearing No. WT/250/2017 (being an appeal from

the Wakf Board Case No: WB/4825/2007), whereby the appeal of the

Appellants was dismissed. The Appellants sought to set aside the said Order

of the Wakf Tribunal and also the Order of the Wakf Board of Sri Lanka dated

05.01.2017 in WB/4825/2007.

Following written submissions of the Appellants being filed on 20.08.2021

and written submissions of the Petitioner-Respondent-Respondents

(hereinafter referred to as Respondents) being filed on 24.12.2021; the

argument concluded on 06.10.2022.

The primary basis of this case involves the cancellation of the registration of

the Jamiuth Thowheed Jumma Mosque situated in Bammanna, Narangoda

and thereby declaring it null and void. Further, the appointment of 11

trustees of the said mosque was also cancelled removing them from the post

of trustees of the said mosque.

The Appellants had submitted documentation to the Department of Muslim

Religious and Cultural Affairs for the registration of Jamiuth Thowheed

Jumma Mosque and the Wakf Board caused registration (at page 99) of the

said mosque on or about 08.07.2007 as a Jumma Mosque. Accordingly,

eleven members were appointed as Trustees of the said Mosque.

However, the Respondents by Petition to the Wakf Board in 2007 in case No:

WB/4795/2017 (at page 113) claimed that the registration of the said mosque

was was caused by a mistake of law or fact.

After extensive proceedings and hearings for a decade, including site visits

being made by Officers, the Wakf Board in its Order dated 05.01.2017 (at page

Page 5

189) determined that the Board has caused the said mosque to be registered

by reason of applying the wrong provision and therefore in terms of section

13(c) of the Wakf Act, the Board revoked the registration of the said mosque

and appointment of the trustees. It is observed that the Wakf Board had

arrived at its conclusion on the basis that the said premises is not a mosque

but an Islamic Centre and that the primary purpose of its declaration of trust

is Charitable and not solely for the purpose of a Jummah Mosque. It is also

stated that the Board should have considered the Application under Part V of

the Wakf Act i.e. as a Muslim Charitable Trust or "Wakf" instead of

registration as a Mosque in terms of section 10.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the Wakf Board , the Apellants appealed

therefrom to the Wakf Tribunal through a Petition dated 23.03.2017 (at page

128). However, the Wakf Tribunal affirmed the Order of the Wakf Board

cancelling the registration of the said mosque under the No. R/1928/KU/160,

as a jummah mosque since the registration has been effected on

misrepresentation of facts and was an erroneous act on the part of the Wakf

Board by its Order on or about 16.02. 2019 (at. Page 218). It is my view that

the learned Chairman of the Wakf Tribunal has analysed all pertinent facts

material to this case in detail to arrive at this conclusion. The attention of

Court is drawn towards the finding that the Application form for registration

of the the mosque contained unsatisfactory information, especially as the

answers to clauses 2, 6, 7, 8, 8(a), 9(b) &9 (c).

At this juncture, I also wish to reiterate the fact that when an Application is

made to register a mosque in an area, whilst another mosque is in existence,

the Wakf Board has a duty to carefully examine Applications for registration

of another mosque and ensure that all criteria to such registration are

properly fulfilled in terms of the law prior to any registration.

This Court is also mindful of the fact that the Appellants were asked to find

some suitable place for their worship and to shift the present mosque to that

Page 6

place. Despite proceedings of the Tribunal being postponed on this basis, have

failed to arrive at a solution.

The governing instruments with regard to this dispute are the Deed of

Declaration of Trust No. 148, dated 02.08.2002 and No. 1455 dated

29.09.2004 attested by S.A.C. Ali Sabry and A.S.M. Minvar, Notary Public

respectively. Upon perusing the provisions of the said indentures submitted

for registration of the mosque, it is apparent that the extensive objectives of

the said property is deemed to be a Muslim Charitable Trust or Wakf and

has to be registered as such in terms of Part V of the Wakf Act and does not

merit registration as a mosque in terms of section 10 of the Act.

Further it is also noted that the said property was not opened for public

worship at the time the application for registration was submitted.

The Court observes the following provisions of the Wakf Act in this regard:

Section 10 - Application for registration of mosques.

(1) The trustee for the time being of a mosque, or if there is no such

trustee, the person for the time being in charge of a mosque,

opened for public worship before the appointed date shall,

within six months after that date, make a written application to

the Board for registration of that mosque.

(2) The trustee for the time being of a mosque, or if there is no such

trustee, the person for the time being in charge of a mosque,

opened for public worship on or after the appointed date shall,

within six months after the date on which that mosque is so

opened, make a written application to the Board for registration of

that mosque.

Section 13C. - Power of Board to cancel the registration of a mosque which had been registered by reason of a mistake of law or of fact

If at any time the Board is satisfied that it has caused a mosque

to be registered by reason of a mistake of law or of fact, it

shall be lawful for the Board to cause the entry relating to that

mosque to be deleted from the register of mosques, and such

mosque shall be deemed to be not registered with effect from the

date of such deletion.

In the above pretext, having considered all facts, documentation and circumstances of the case, it is my considered view that the cancellation of the registration of the said mosque by the Wakf Board in terms of section 13(c) is rightful, as the registration in the first instance was caused by reason of a mistake of law and fact. Therefore, I affirm the Order of the Wakf Tribunal of Sri Lanka dated 16.02.2019 in case bearing No. WT/250/2017. For the above reasons, I dismiss the appeal of the Appellants.

I make no Order as to costs.

The Registrar is directed to communicate this judgement to the Wakf Board and Wakf Tribunal, and to dispatch the original case record to the Wakf Tribunal.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

S. U. B. Karalliyadde, J.

I agree.
