MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioners by their petition dated 02.12.2019, are seeking, inter alia,

the following reliefs:

(b). A writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 27th Respondent

(University Grants Commission-UGC) dated 08-08-2019 suspending the

Postgraduate Degree Course MD (AYU) [Vachaspathi] 2016/19 conducted

by the Institute of Indigenous Medicine contained in the document marked

P26.

Page 9 of 19

(c). A writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 3rd Respondent (The

Commissioner of Ayurveda) contained in P25 (a).

(d). A writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 55th Respondent (The

Commissioner of Ayurveda-Western Province) contained in P25 (b).

(e). A writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 3rd Respondent (The

Commissioner of Ayurveda) contained in P25 (c).

The 1st, 28th 54th Respondents moved for a dismissal of the Application

on the basis, inter-alia, that;

1. The Institute of Indigenous Medicine (hereinafter referred to as the

IIM) had not yet incorporated into the curriculum of the MD program

suggestions made by the Standing Committee of Indigenous

Medicine of the University Grants Commission.

2. The IIM has been mandated to continue with the syllabuses only

upon approval by UGC.

3. Upon the recommendation of the Standing Committee of Indigenous

Medicine, the UGC decided to suspend the Post Graduate Degree

Program Ayurveda/Siddha/Unani conducted by the IIM with

immediate effect.

4. Since the UGC has suspended the said Course and no approval has

been granted, the IIM is not in a position to conduct the same.

5. The UGC has allowed awarding of the MD in Ayurveda at the Post

Graduate Institute of Indigenous Medicine (hereinafter referred to as

the PGIIM) affiliated with the University of Colombo.

The 27th Respondent, in its statements of objection, took up the position,

inter-alia, that;

Page 10 of 19

1. The UGC received a proposal for establishing a Postgraduate Degree

Programme MD (Ayu) from the IIM. The UGC referred the matter to

the Standing Committee on Post-Graduate Studies and Research for

its observations and recommendations. As per the recommendation

of the Standing Committee on Post-Graduate Studies and Research,

the UGC appointed a Review Panel. Thereafter, the UGC

conditionally approved the said program subject to the incorporation

of proposed amendments suggested by the Review Panel. Since the

IIM failed to adhere to the proposed amendments, the UGC

suspended the said program.

2. The UGC states that in the absence of a duly formulated curriculum

in keeping with the standards and training components required as

recommended by the relevant subject expert panel of the UGC, inter-

alia, the provisions of the Sri-Lanka Qualification Framework (2015)

as well the relevant Service Minute, there was no basis to revise the

decision of suspension.

3. The UGC further states that in view of the non-compliance with

required standards in the formulation of a curriculum and the failure

to submit a duly revised document by the 1st Respondent, the UGC

which is mandated to exercise regulatory authority in terms of

section 15 (5) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978, is unable to

approve the relevant Masters Program.

4. The 27th Respondent further states that the Standing Committees of

the UGC which are established under section 4 (2) of the Universities

Act are not empowered to approve the study programs, which is a

power exclusively vested with the UGC itself.

Page 11 of 19

The contention of the Petitioners in a nutshell:

The IIM called for applications for the Postgraduate Degree Course in MD

(AYU) [Vachaspathi]- 2016/2019. On or before 28-02-2016, all the

Petitioners submitted applications for the said Course, and accordingly,

by letters marked as P5 (a) to P5 (e), the Petitioners were selected to follow

the same. The Petitioners were approved for three years of educational

leave commencing from 23-02-2017 as well. Thereupon, the Petitioners

commenced coursework and reading for the said course in the IIM from

06-03-2017.

When the Petitioners came to know that the said course was not approved

by the UGC, the Petitioners requested the 1st and 3rd Respondents to

resolve the issues prevalent in the said course. In pursuant to the said

request, the 3rd Respondent with the participation of the representatives

of the 1st Respondent, the 5th Respondent, the 27th Respondent and all

the relevant institutions convened a meeting on 02-06-2017 at the

Department of Ayurveda to resolve the issues relevant to the said course.

Accordingly, by letter dated 14-08-2017 (P13), the 1st Respondent

informed the 3rd Respondent that the Petitioners would be allowed to

continue their studies without any impediments. In the meantime, by

letter dated 14-09-2017 (P14), the UGC informed the 3rd Respondent that

the said course has not been recommended or approved by the Standing

Committee.

Thereafter, by the Gazette Extraordinary dated 08-12-2017, the PGIIM was

established and the UGC in its letter dated 11-07-2017 (P14) expressed

its opinion that the Petitioners will be able to continue their postgraduate

studies at the PGIIM. By letter dated 27-03-2018 (P19) addressed to the

University of Colombo with a copy to the IIM, the UGC informed inter-alia,

Page 12 of 19

that the IIM is allowed to conduct the said program for the 2016/2019

batch only, subject to the submission of the curriculum through proper

channel, whereby the IIM has not submitted the curriculum. In these

circumstances, the 3rd Respondent, by letters dated 22-10-2019 marked

as P25 (a), (b) and (c) informed the 1st to 3rd and 5th Petitioners that the

Postgraduate Degree Course MD (AYU) [Vachaspathi] 2016/19 has been

suspended and to report back to service immediately. Subsequently, the

UGC by letter dated 29-08-2019 marked as P26, informed the 1st

Respondent that as per the recommendation of the Standing Committee

on Indigenous Medicine, the UGC decided to suspend the said program

conducted by the IIM with immediate effect.

The Petitioners state that the decision of the UGC is irrational, arbitrary,

capricious, illegal, and in total violation of the rules of natural justice.

Moreover, the Petitioners state that they have a legitimate expectation to

continue the said program at the IIM.

Observation and determination:

The UGC received a proposal for establishing a Postgraduate Degree

Program MD (Ayu) from the IIM. The UGC decided to refer the proposal to

the Standing Committee on Post-Graduate Studies and Research for its

observations and recommendations. According to the recommendation of

the Standing Committee on Post Graduate Studies and Research, the UGC

appointed a Review Panel comprising Dr. Senaka Pilapitiya-Rajarata

University, Prof. Nelum De Silva- University of Ruhuna and Dr. (Ms) S.

Pancharajah-University of Jaffna, which observed that;

1. The eligibility requirement of the proposal was unsatisfactory due to

the reasons specified in the review report marked as 27R4, 27R4A,

27R4B and 27R4C.

Page 13 of 19

2. Dr. Senaka Pilapitiya had not recommended proceeding further. He

had specially observed the inadequacy of a clinical training

component enabling practitioners to reach the required levels of

competence.

3. Dr. Nelum De Silva also observed that specialization in the relevant

field is necessary for Ayurveda Medical Officers, and observed further

that the eligibility requirement was unsatisfactory.

By letter dated 09-02-2012 marked as 27R5A, addressed to the 28th

Respondent with a copy to the 1st Respondent, the UGC conditionally

approved the said course subject to the incorporation of the proposed

amendments suggested by the Review Panel. A meeting was convened on

12-06-2012 with the Ministry of Higher Education and representatives of

the relevant institutions in order to resolve the issues and a separate

committee was appointed to incorporate the recommendations of the

Review Panel of the UGC into the Course Syllabus. Accordingly, the IIM

was requested by the UGC to ensure that the amended course syllabus

be submitted on or before 15-08-2012 (Vide document marked 27R9A).

Since the IIM failed to submit the curriculum before the deadline, the UGC

by letter dated 12-07-2012 marked as 27R10A temporarily suspended the

program until the detailed curriculum was submitted.

In these circumstances, this matter was reconsidered by the UGC on 15-

06-2017 and the following decisions were taken;

1. The Commission having discussed this matter at length, decided to

have a meeting with the Ministry of Health, Indigenous Medicine and

Nutrition with regard to the 1st batch of students who have completed

the MD program at the IIM.

Page 14 of 19

2. The Commission was of the view that the students of other batches

can be admitted to the proposed PGIIM once it is established.

3. The Commission also decided to inquire from the Director-IIM

whether the curriculum of MD (Ayurveda/Siddha/Unani) has

included the requirements of the Ministry of Health Indigenous

Medicine and Nutrition as per the relevant Gazette /applicable

Service Minute {i.e. Gazette Extraordinary No. 1882/50 dated 03-10-

2014- Minute of the Sri Lanka Ayurveda Medical Service} which

requires inter-alia, a medical consultant to have followed a minimum

of 3 years full-time Post Graduate Degree in the respective subject

areas (27R17, 27R17A & 27R17B).

As such, the UGC by letter dated 16-102017 marked as 27R20B,

requested IIM to submit the curriculum of MD (Ayurveda/Siddha/Unani)

as recommended by the Standing Committee within three months, on or

before 21-12-2017), which reads thus;

The University Grants Commission at its 972nd meeting held on 21st

September 2017 noted that as per the decision taken at its 966th meeting,

the Institute of Indigenous Medicine (IIM) was requested to include the

curriculum of MD (Ayurveda/Siddha/Unani) as per the requirement of

Ministry of Health, Nutrition & Indigenous Medicine, Gazette Notification

and the serviceMinute of the same.

Further; the Commission decided to inform you to submit the curriculum of

MD (Ayurveda/Siddha/Unani) as per the requirement Ministry of Health,

Nutrition & Indigenous Medicine. Gazette notification and the Service

minute.

Accordingly, please send the curriculum of MD (Ayurveda/Siddha/Unani)

as recommended by the Standing Committee held on 11th September 2017

Page 15 of 19

within three months (on or before 21st December 2017) as requested by the

Ministry of Health, Nutrition & Indigenous Medicine.

This decision of the Commission is conveyed to you for your information and

necessary action.

As per the document marked 27R25, it is evident that there was a meeting

convened with affected batches of students as well, in order to ensure that

they were given a proper hearing in an endeavor to resolve the matter.

After having considered the views of the affected students, the UGC

allowed the IIM to continue the program provided that the curriculum is

submitted through proper channels (Vide- letter dated 13-07-2018

marked as 27R30C). Since the IIM failed to submit the properly

formulated curriculum for approval of the UGC, the latter decided to

suspend the said program, and accordingly by letter dated 29-08-2019

marked as P26/27R31B informed the IIM that the said program has been

suspended with immediate effect. Thereafter, the UGC approved the

Postgraduate course at the PGIIM. Having considered the detriment

caused to the students, the UGC once again by letter dated 24-03-2021

marked as 27R39B requested the IIM to submit a revised proposal on the

MD (Ayu) Postgraduate Degree program to consider for approval. In view

of the non-compliance with required standards in the formulation of a

curriculum and the failure to submit a duly revised document by the IIM

and the University of Colombo, the UGC did not approve the said program.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner contended that the UGC

has no authority to suspend the said program which is vested with the

Senate of the 28th Respondent. Furthermore, the UGC has no power to

approve any course, syllabus or program. As such, the decision which is

contained in P26 is illegal and ultra-vires. The central issue to be

Page 16 of 19

determined by this Court is whether the UGC has power/authority to

approve the course, syllabus or program of the universities.

In this regard, I refer to section 15 (v) of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978

(as amended), which reads thus;

The Commission shall have and exercise all or any of the following

powers :-

(v) to determine, in consultation with the governing authority of each

Higher Educational Institution, the courses which shall be provided

therein, and the degrees, diplomas, and other academic distinctions

which shall be awarded ;

Section 29 (d) of the said Act reads as follows;

Subject to the powers, duties and functions of the Commission,

a University shall have power-

(d) to provide postgraduate courses, and for this purpose, to co-operate

with other universities or authorities in Sri Lanka or abroad, in such

manner and for such purposes as the University may determine;

Section 46 (6) (iv) of the said Act is reproduced as follows;

Subject to the provisions of this Act and without prejudice to the

generality of the powers conferred upon it by subsection (5), the Senate

shall exercise, perform and discharge the following powers, duties

and functions;-

(iv) to recommend to the Council after consideration of reports from the

Faculty or the Faculties concerned-

Page 17 of 19

(a) schemes for the reorganization of existing Faculties and

Departments of Study and the organization of new Faculties and

Departments of Study; and

(b) the assignment of subjects of study to the respective Faculties;

Thereby, according to the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978, the University

Grants Commission (UGC) has the power to determine the courses to be

offered.

Considering these provisions, it is evident that the University of Colombo,

as the 28th Respondent and the IIM, have a statutory responsibility to

design and implement study programs subject to the relevant by-laws,

standards, and criteria set by the UGC, ensuring compliance with the

specified standards regulated by the UGC.

In the present scenario, it is abundantly clear that the universities which

have been established under the Universities Act are not autonomous in

introducing new courses and programs without the approval and sanction

of the UGC.

The UGC holds exclusive and sole authority to grant approval for

universities to introduce new courses and programs. I firmly reject the

contention put forth by the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner,

asserting that although the UGC has the power to approve courses, it lacks

the power to determine the syllabus for such courses. It is well understood

that courses cannot exist without a syllabus. Therefore, if the UGC

possesses the power to approve courses, it necessarily follows that it also

holds the authority to decide the syllabus for such courses in accordance

with the provisions of the Universities Act.

Page 18 of 19

In the present application, the IIM rightly sought permission from the UGC

to establish the aforementioned postgraduate degree. Subsequently, the

UGC constituted a panel of experts to examine this matter. The UGC

requested the IIM to incorporate the recommendations of the expert panel

into the syllabus of the proposed postgraduate degree to ensure the

maintenance of academic standards.

Regrettably, despite being provided with ample opportunities by the UGC

to comply with its requests, the IIM utterly failed to do so. Given these

circumstances, the UGC had no alternative but to disapprove the said

program.

It is the considered opinion of this Court that the decision taken by the

UGC, as contained in document P26, is justifiable, falls within the

authority conferred by law (intra vires), and is consistent with the

provisions of the Universities Act.

Furthermore, it is ensured that through the establishment of the PGIIM

for postgraduate studies, the discontinuation of the disputed program by

the UGC will not cause any prejudice to the petitioners.

It is borne out from the documents marked P9A, P9C, P9C, P101, P10, P12

etc that the Petitioners were fully aware of the fact that the postgraduate

program in dispute was not within an adequate standard and the IIM failed

to comply with the report presented by the expert panel of the UGC.

Further, as per the document marked 27R25, the UGC had kept informed

the Petitioners the present situation and the Petitoners were given an

adequate hearing as well. As such it appears to this Court that the UGC

had adhered to the principles of natural justice.

Page 19 of 19

For the foregoing reasons, it is the view of this Court that the instant

Application of the Petitioners is devoid of merits. Thus, the Application is

dismissed. No costs.

Application dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
