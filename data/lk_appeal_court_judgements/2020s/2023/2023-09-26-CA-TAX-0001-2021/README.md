This is an application made by the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) under the Tax Appeals

Commission Act No. 23 of 2011 as amended challenging a decision made

by the Tax Appeals Commission (hereinafter referred to as the TAC)

allowing a tax exemption to Aitken Spence Travels Limited (hereinafter

referred to as the Respondent).

The instant appeal is made against the assessment made for the taxable

period 2011/2012 which was heard by the TAC on 01.10.2019. The

respondent provides travel related services to clients such as Foreign Tour

Operators (FTO) who organise tours to tourists visiting Sri Lanka. In the

present matter, the respondent has claimed a tax exemption under Section

13(ddd) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 as amended (hereinafter

referred to as the IR Act). The Assistant Commissioner of the Inland

Revenue Department had rejected the returns submitted by the

3

CA-TAX-01-21 Page 3 of 8 26/09/2023 IJ-28-23

respondent for the said assessment year and had issued assessment for

the period without granting the claimed exemption.

Upon disagreeing with the decision, the respondent has appealed to the

appellant, where on 15.12.2016 the appellant affirmed the decision of the

Assistant Commissioner. The respondent being dissatisfied with the said

determination has appealed to the TAC on 27.02.2017 complying with

Section 7 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act No. 23 of 2011 as amended

(hereinafter referred to as the TAC Act).

The TAC, after considering the submissions made by the two parties at the

hearing appeal, has held on 25.08.2020 that the respondent is entitled to

the respective tax exemption under Section 13(ddd) of the IR Act.

Thereafter the appellant has requested the TAC on 23.09.2020 requesting

to have a case stated for the opinion of this Court. The main contention at

the hand of the TAC was whether the respondent falls within the ambit of

Section 13(ddd) of the Act. Having regard the material available, TAC was

of the view that the respondent cannot be denied the tax concessions

claimed vis--vis the services performed by the respondent company on

behalf of the FTOs. The questions of law raised by the appellant in the

instant case in accordance with Section 11A of the TAC Act are as follows;

1. Has the TAC erred in interpreting Section 13(ddd) of the IR Act as the

FTOs were the recipient of the services rendered by the respondent

company, not the foreign tourists who were physically present in Sri

Lanka?

Section 13 (ddd) of the IR Act: (There shall be exempt from

income tax)the profits and income earned in foreign

currency by any resident company, any resident individual or

any partnership in Sri Lanka, from any service rendered in or

outside Sri Lanka to any person or partnership outside Sri

Lanka, other than any commission, discount or similar receipt

for any such service rendered in Sri Lanka, if such profits and

4

CA-TAX-01-21 Page 4 of 8 26/09/2023 IJ-28-23

income (less such amount, if any, expended outside Sri Lanka

as is considered by the Commissioner-General to be reasonable

expenses) are remitted to Sri Lanka through a bank.

2. Whether the TAC erred in determining that the respondent company

can treat as dependent agent satisfying the requirements for a

Permanent Establishment (PE) of each FTO under the Double Tax

Agreements between Sri Lanka and the country of the particular

FTO?

In answering the first question of law in the case stated, this Court would

like to deconstruct Section 13(ddd) of the IR Act incorporated by the

amendment of Act No. 09 of 2008, depicting the requisites of the provision

to be exempted from income tax.

1. the profits and income earned in foreign currency

2. by any resident company, any resident individual or any

partnership in Sri Lanka,

3. from any service rendered in or outside Sri Lanka

4. to any person or partnership outside Sri Lanka

5. other than any commission, discount or similar payment

6. if such profits and income (less such amount, if any, expended

outside Sri Lanka as is considered by the Commissioner-General to

be reasonable expenses) are remitted to Sri Lanka through a bank

The most contentious limb of the provision vis--vis the instant matter has

being determining whether the service recipient of the respondent is

situated inside or outside Sri Lanka. The TAC in their decision has

assessed the relationship between FTOs and the tourists and the FTOs

and the respondent. The TAC determination states that the FTOs based

outside Sri Lanka have entered into contracts with the respondent and the

respondent at the request of the FTOs arrange the contents of the tour

package such as hotels, transportation and excursions, sold by the FTO to

its tourists. The respondent provides services to the foreign tourists at the

5

CA-TAX-01-21 Page 5 of 8 26/09/2023 IJ-28-23

request of the FTOs and the respondent is paid by the FTO. The TAC

further reasons that although there is a binding agreement between

foreign tourists and the FTO there is no such agreement between the

respondent and the foreign tourists, thereby, for any shortcomings in

services provided by the respondent it is only the FTO that can claim

damages from the respondent and the tourists have no cause of action

against the respondent. The view of the TAC on the argument of the

appellant that the foreign tourists were physically present in Sri Lanka and

there was provision of services to them, is that, as there is no binding

agreement between the foreign tourists and the respondent and as there

is one between the respondent and the FTOs which are located outside Sri

Lanka, the particular activity of the respondent company becomes a

provision of services to an entity outside Sri Lanka and thereby is eligible

for the income tax exemption. In the instant application, the same

argument has been made by the appellant in their submissions and this

Court is inclined to accept the determination of the TAC on this contention

to be valid and well-reasoned.

As the TAC has rightly analysed, the income received by the respondent in

foreign currency is remitted by the FTOs. As Section 13(ddd) mentions,

provision of services could be in or outside Sri Lanka, however the service

recipients with a binding contractual obligation are located outside Sri

Lanka. Thus, although technically the respondent provides a service to

the foreign tourists within Sri Lanka by conducting the aforementioned

activities, the income in foreign currency which is eligible for the tax

exemption is remitted only by the FTOs. Therefore, the service provided to

foreign tourists is irrelevant and immaterial for tax exemptions under the

IR Act. In the case of Commissioner General of Inland Revenue vs

Aitken Spence Travels (Pvt) Ltd. CA No. CA/TAX/0031/2019 dated

26.05.2022, a case between the same parties for the assessment year of

2010/2011; Sampath K. B. Wijeratne J. held the same view and reasoning.

His Lordship also referred to the English case of Commissioners of

Customs and Excise vs Plantiflor Limited [2002] UKHL 33 to determine

6

CA-TAX-01-21 Page 6 of 8 26/09/2023 IJ-28-23

the nature of the contractual obligations between three parties who

entered into two separate but related bilateral contracts. In this case it was

held that a particular activity, conducted between the two parties who have

not entered into a binding agreement with each other, is considered to be

conducted pursuant to the relevant partys pre-existing contract with the

other party which is entered into by both parties as principals. Wijeratne

J. elaborates that ASTL provides two different types of services, firstly to

FTO of the right to have the services agreed between the FTO and ASTL

rendered to the foreign tourists in Sri Lanka and secondly, the provision of

agreed services to the foreign tourists in Sri Lanka. ASTL earns an income

by providing their services to FTO who are outside of Sri Lanka. On the other

hand, even though ASTL provides agreed services to foreign tourists, ASTL

does not earn an income from them.

At this juncture, this Court believes it is necessary to mention the case of

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue vs Aitken Spence Travels

(Pvt) Ltd CA No. CA/TAX/04/2016 dated 13.11.2018, case between the

same parties for the assessment year of 2009/2010. In this case the Court

has identified two types of services in existence which was later followed

by Wijeratne J. in the aforementioned case. However, this Court refrains

from referring to the deduction of the aforementioned judgment as this

Court has reservations and ambiguities about the reasonings of the said

case.

The predominant factor to find the decision of TAC to be accurate is that,

the income is remitted to the respondent only by the FTO and not by the

foreign tourists, thereby, the service provided to the foreign tourists is

irrelevant and immaterial within the ambit of Section 13(ddd) of the IR Act,

Furthermore, in arriving at this determination, this Court would like to

emphasise the purpose of tax exemptions in an economy. Tax exemptions

on foreign remittance are generally granted to incentivise resident entities

to increase foreign activities, thereby, increasing the flow of foreign

currency to the local economy. This can enhance the livelihood and the

7

CA-TAX-01-21 Page 7 of 8 26/09/2023 IJ-28-23

economy of a country. Further, this particular exemption encourages

resident entities to use legal and legitimate means of remittance i.e. banks,

without resorting to illegal and cheaper methods to remit foreign income.

On one hand this supports the local banking system and on the other hand

it helps with assessing and calculating the economic realities.

The second question posed to this Court in the case stated is whether the

TAC erred in determining that the respondent company can be treated as

dependent agent satisfying the requirements for a Permanent

Establishment (PE) of each FTO under the Double Tax Agreements

between Sri Lanka and the country of the particular FTO. When perusing

the decision of the TAC it is evident that the TAC has not conclusively

determined the respondent to be a dependent agent or an agent, although

that argument submitted by the appellant is discussed in Page 09 of the

TAC decision. Furthermore, information relevant to determine this matter,

such as the locations of FTOs, existence of double tax agreements with

such countries are not sufficiently presented to this Court. As an example,

the case of Johnson and Johnson (Private) Limited vs Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue CA No. CA/TAX/0039/2019 dated

27.05.2022, had the same question of law in their case stated. In the

judgement Dr. Ruwan Fernando J. extensively analysed the double

taxation agreements and the TAC had overtly determined on this matter

in their assessment. Further, there was requisite facts and information

presented to the Court to opine. This Court also noted that this particular

question of law has not been contended in previous cases between the

same parties for prior assessment years.

For the reasons set out above, this Court holds that the TAC did not err in

law when it arrived at the conclusion that it did. Accordingly, this Court

answers the questions of law in the case stated for the opinion of this Court

as follows:

8

CA-TAX-01-21 Page 8 of 8 26/09/2023 IJ-28-23

1. No, the TAC correctly interpreted the service recipient under Section

13(ddd) of the IR Act.

2. No, the TAC has not determined the respondent to be a dependent agent

of the FTOs.

In light of the answers given to the above two questions of law, acting under

Section 11A (6) of the TAC Act, this Court confirms the determination of

the TAC. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this

judgment to the Secretary of the TAC.

Application dismissed.
