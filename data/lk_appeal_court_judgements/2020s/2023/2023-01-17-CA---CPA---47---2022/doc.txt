Counsel: Nihara Renakiya for the Accused Petitioner.

Indika Nelummini SC for the State.

Argued on: 23.11.2022

Decided on: 17.01.2023

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J

The instant application has been filed to set aside the order dated

2.3.2022 of the High Court of Colombo in which bail has been refused to

the accused namely Mallawaarrachhige Samantha Nandana Kumara.

The accused in the instant matter had been remanded for the possession

of 4.26 grams of pure quantity of heroin under the provisions of Poisons

Opium and Dangerous Drugs act and has been indicted for the same and

Page 3 of 4

the trial has commenced and one witness has been concluded and the

other are to be led.

The main submission of the Counsel for the accused is the period in

remand and the fact that the child was sitting for the Ordinary level exam.

The learned High Court Judge has considered the same and had rejected

both grounds as being not suitable to enlarge the accused on bail.

The law pertaining to the instant matter is that if a suspect is produced

under section 54 A and B of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs

act, the said suspect can be released on bail only upon exceptional

conditions by the Court of Appeal, if the quantity in question is more

than 10 grams, but in the instant matter the quantity is less than five

grams and the accused has been in remand for more than two years

hence under the provisions of the latest amendment to the instant act

under section 84 an accused tried or convicted cannot be kept in

remand for more than 12 months and the Attorney General can make

an application to the High Court for an extension of the period but again

for not more than another 12 months and in totality it is 24 months and

nothing more.

But the Court of Appeal not withstanding section 84 and 85 of the

amendment has to consider exceptional circumstances when

considering bail for a case in which the quantity of heroin is more than

10 grams.

In the instant matter the quantity involved is less than five grams and

the accused has been in remand since 2020 which is more than two

years up to now.

Hence as per section 84 and 85 of the amendment act no 41 of 2022 the

instant application for revision is allowed and the impugned order of

the learned High Court Judge is hereby set aside, and we order the

learned High Court Judge to enlarge the above named accused on

suitable conditions of bail.

Neil Iddawala J.

I agree
