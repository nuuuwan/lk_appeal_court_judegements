B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the Accused) aggrieved by the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High

Court Judge of Colombo.

The Accused was indicted before the High Court of Colombo for having in his

possession 2.44 grams of Diacetylmorphine, commonly known as Heroin, and trafficking

the said quantity of Heroin on 10th January 2014, which are offences punishable under

the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance No. 13 of 1984, as amended.

The Prosecution led the evidence of three witnesses including that of the

government analyst and drew its case to a conclusion. The Accused made a dock statement

and led the evidence of one witness. The learned High Court Judge of Colombo found the

Accused guilty on both counts. As such, the Accused was convicted and sentenced to life

imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by said judgment this appeal was preferred by the Accused.

The following are the grounds of appeal urged by the learned Counsel for the

Accused:

Page 3 of 13

The Learned Trial Judge had not correctly applied the test of probability and

improbability in order to determine the creditworthiness of the Prosecution

Witnesses;

The Trial Judge had failed to consider the vital contradictions of the Prosecution

Witnesses;

The Learned Trial Judge had failed to consider the weaknesses of the Prosecutions

case;

The Learned Trial Judge had wrongly rejected the dock statement and the

evidence of the Defence witness.

The facts, albeit in brief, as per evidence led by the Prosecution are as set out

hereinafter.

PW1, SI Weerasingha Mudiyanselage Imal Jayalath Thennakoon was on duty at

the Special Task Force (STF) attached to the Gonahena base. According to his evidence,

on 10th January 2014 at around 18.30-19.00hrs, PW4, namely PC 75756 Bandara,

informed PW1 of information he received through his informant on a possible drug

trafficking, supposed to take place between 21.00-23.00hrs on the same day. PW1 then

organized a raid. PW1 and his team (comprising of SI Prakash (PW2), PC 75477

Weerasundara (PW3), PC 75756 Bandara (PW4), PC 77221 Rajakaruna (PW5), PC 83435

Chathuranga (PW6), PC Driver 2826 Thilakarathna) left the STF base in civil attire in a

cab at around 19.30hrs and arrived near Sugathadasa Stadium at around 20.45hrs. The

informant arrived around 21.15hrs and PW4 introduced him to PW1 and PW2. The

informant gave information about the person in question, described him, claiming to be

able to identify him, and further claimed that he can take the officers to where the suspect

would appear.

Thereafter, PW1 and PW2 along with the informant travelled by foot about 300m

to a place near Siriyansiri Hotel at Babar Junction. At around 22.00hrs, the informant

pointed out a person who arrived at the Siriyansiri Hotel by a three-wheeler as the suspect

and left.

As stated by PW1 (on page 81 of the Brief- proceedings dated 05.03.2018):

. .

PW1 and PW2 then crossed the road, approached the person in front of Siriyansiri

Hotel, and conducted a search. When approached by the officers the suspect had started

to panic. The search was conducted by PW1. He found two parcels of grocery bags in his

right trouser pocket which upon inspection were suspected to contain Heroin.

The Accused was arrested at 22.00hrs and the two parcels containing heroin were

retained by PW1. They proceeded to Sew Gunasekara Pawning Centre in Maradana to

weigh the heroin at around 22.30hrs. The weight was recorded as 5g and 830mg.

Thereafter, the PW1 and the officers with the Accused came to Kotahena Police Station.

At the station, the production was sealed and handed over to PC 48846 from Kotahena

Police reserve under PR number 75/2014 at 12.05hrs, along with the Accused and his

belongings (his wallet, drivers license, mobile phone, bank card, and Rs. 3910/- in cash).

Finally, the entry pertaining to the arrest was made at the Gonahena Base at 02.25hrs.

The other main witness is SI Mohottalalage Praksh Sooriyabandara (PW2),

attached to STF, Gonahena Base. With a few contradictions which we will analyse further

below, PW2s narration of events on the arrest of the Accused is similar to that of PW1.

The third and final witness is Pathirage Sandya Kumuduni Rajapaksa, a senior

Government Analyst (PW19). It should be noted that there is a discrepancy between the

weight of the heroin recorded at the pawning centre (5g 830mg) and the weight recorded

by PW19 (6g 32mg). This witness explained that the weighing scale at the government

department is accurate, and the particular weighing scale is periodically tested. It is

further noted that a discrepancy could have occurred if an inexperienced person operated

the scale.

As set out in her evidence (on page 160 of the Brief proceedings dated 12.03.2018):

- . .

.

Be that as it may, the slight discrepancy in weight could not be said to have caused

any prejudice to the Accused, a limb that must be satisfied in terms of the Constitutional

provision conferring this Courts appellate jurisdiction. The learned Trial Judge rightly

concluded that this discrepancy could not assail the version of the Prosecution.

Page 5 of 13

The Accused, in a lengthy dock statement, took up the position that the only reason

he was there at Armor Street was to receive money on behalf of a friend. He had arrived

at 19.30hrs and thereafter he was approached by three persons who arrived in a red three-

wheeler, asking about a package. He claims that he called his friend informing this and

thereafter he was told to leave. Subsequently, two of those three individuals pursued the

Accused and put him in the three-wheeler, asking about drug trafficking. He was then

taken near Sugathadasa Stadium, transferred to a cab and kept there. According to him

he was asked to sign some blank papers. Then he made calls to a friend and a known

priest using the cab drivers mobile phone. According to the Accused, he only met PW1 at

the Kotahena Police Station and not before. It is further claimed by the Accused that

earlier that day he purchased a pen drive and a sub-woofer, which was retained by the

police and never returned. The other witness he called was the priest, Rev. Elapatha

Samitha (D1). D1, in his evidence, stated that the Accused called him at around 20.30-

21.00hrs that he was put into a van. He further claimed that he was verbally abused by

the person who was with the Accused who identified himself as an STF officer. D1 then

called a lawyer and on his advice went to Kotahena Police Station around 23.00-23.30hrs

and made a compliant. Under cross examination D1 has admitted that in the Police

statement he had mentioned that he received the call at 23.25hrs.

The main allegation by the Accused is that the arrest was not done by PW1,

therefore his notes are wrong and manipulated. According to him, the raid was done by

PW2 and PW4 not at the place they claimed to have arrested the Accused, but at Armor

Street. In addition to that, the learned Counsel questioned why they went to Sew

Gunasekara Pawning Centre in Maradana which is far from the place of arrest i.e.

Kotahena (3km).

In evaluating the evidence of the Prosecution, the Learned Trial Judge was

mindful of the fact that these are trained officers. Hence, the learned Judge considered

even the small discrepancies in the Prosecutions evidence, yet considered the

Prosecutions version as probable. In this regard, he observed strong overall consistency

between the evidence of PW1 and PW2. The Learned Trial Judge noted that they were

from the Gonahena STF camp and not police officers from the area itself, which justifies

their limited knowledge of the roads and the geographic whereabouts. This limited

knowledge does not however explain why PW1 did not go to the Narcotic Bureau which

was located much closer to the place of arrest than the pawning centre, knowing the

weighing can be done there. According to the evidence of PW1 and PW2, it is unclear

Page 6 of 13

whose decision it was to go to the pawning centre. Though it is possible that the officers

knew of the pawning centre as an obvious destination that can be utilized in similar

circumstances. Also, according to PW1 they knew it was open 24/7, yet another detail

upon which their decision is justified. Taken the evidence as a whole, the question of

probability does arise, but we find this not substantial enough to challenge the credibility

of the version of the Prosecution.

When we consider the overall evidence of PW1, he was consistent with regard to

where the raid took place. When questions were asked regarding the place, the pawning

shop, and how he reached the pawning shop he promptly answered without hesitation.

This further confirms his involvement in the raid. We, therefore, reject the first ground.

In considering the second ground raised by the Defence, this Court is mindful of

the contradictions inter se between PW1 and PW2. The Learned Counsel for the Accused

shed light on a few events, mostly regarding the arrest and the events leading up to it.

As stated by PW1 (On page 54 of the Brief proceedings dated 28.03.2018):

Contradicting the above, PW2 states (On page 126 of the Brief proceedings dated

05.03.2018):

This Court will consider how the learned Trial Judge appreciated these contradictions.

The relevant excerpt of the judgment (on page 211 of the Brief) is as follows:

.. 01 02

.

. .

.

.

This court has to consider whether these contradictions have gone to the root of the

case. That is to say, whether these contradictions are vital.

We are mindful of the observations made by Justice Thakkar with regard to

contradictions in Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State Of Gujarat 1983 AIRHC 753:

(1) By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape is

replayed on the mental screen. (2) ordinarily it so happens that a witness is

overtaken by events. The witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which

so often has an element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be

expected to be attuned to absorb the details. (3) The powers of observation differ

from person to person. What one may notice, another may not. An object or

movement might emboss its image on one person's mind whereas it might go

unnoticed on the part of another. (4) By and large people cannot accurately recall

a conversation and reproduce the very words used by them or heard by them. They

can only recall the main purport of the conversation. It is unrealistic to expect a

witness to be a human tape recorder. (5) In regard to exact time of an incident, or

the time duration of an occurrence, usually, people make their estimates by guess

work on the spur of the moment 1.1 at the time of interrogation. And one cannot

expect people to make very precise or reliable estimates in such matters. Again, it

depends on the time- sense of individuals which varies from person to person

Page 8 of 13

When assessing the above discrepancies, it is important to understand the context.

According to Prosecutions evidence, PW1 is the officer who received the information from

PW4, got authorization from his superiors, put together the team and organized the raid.

In getting to Babar Street, PW1 is led by the informant and it is only on PW1s orders

PW2 joined the party. All these factors are relevant in understanding that PW1 had more

reasons to be attentive. When following someone along as opposed to leading the party,

naturally the person is bound to pay less attention. This is likely to result in a blurry

version of the events years later when the person gives evidence (Over four years later, in

this matter).

Another factor to keep in mind is that both PW1 and PW2 are officers of STF which

is a specialized unit in its own regard, but one that does not deal especially with the likes

of drug cases. On the other hand, considering considerable time has lapsed since the raid,

if the two witnesses evidence is matching to the smallest detail, the Court would have

more of a reason to be suspicious of the Prosecutions version and its truthfulness.

In this light, it is worth referring to the dictum in State of Uttar Pradesh v. M. K.

Anthony 1984 (2) SCJ 236. This was adopted by his Lordship Ranjit Silva J. in Nanediri

Devage Wilman CA 122/2005, decided on 12.11.2007:

Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper

technical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here or there from the evidence,

attaching importance to some technical error committed by the investigating officer not

going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit the rejection of evidence as a

whole. If the court, before whom the witness gives evidence had the opportunity to form

an opinion about the general tenor of evidence given by the witness, the appellate court

which had not this benefit will have to attach due weight to the appreciation of evidence

by the trial court and unless there are reasons weighty and formidable it would not be

proper to reject the evidence on the grounds of minor variations or infirmities in the

matter of trivial details. Even honest and truthful witness may differ in some details

unrelated to the main incident because power of observation, retention and reproduction

differ with individuals. Cross examination is an unequal duel between a rustic and refined

lawyer. Having examined the evidence of this witness, a friend and well-wisher of the

family carefully giving due weight to the comments made by the learned Counsel for the

respondent and the reasons assigned to by the High Court for rejecting his evidence

simultaneously keeping in view the appreciation of the evidence of this witness by the

Page 9 of 13

trial court, we have no hesitation in holding that the High Court was in error in rejecting

the testimony of witness Nair whose evidence appears to us trustworthy and credible.

With the above dictum in mind, we hold that the particular contradiction does not

go to the root of the matter. We cannot hold the contradictions are vital enough to assail

the Prosecutions version.

The final ground raised by the learned Counsel for the Accused was that the

learned High Court Judge failed to consider the dock statement of the Accused and the

evidence of the Defence. Before we analyse the dock statement in the instant case, we

have to consider the evidentiary value of a dock statement.

In Weddikkarage Thusharika Priyadarshani v. AG CA/HCC/0080/2020 decided on

05.09.2022, his Lordship Abayakoon J. considered the law on dock statements:

In the case of Queen Vs. Kularatne (1968) 71 NLR 529, it was held that while

jurors must be informed that such a statement must be looked upon as evidence

subjected however, to the infirmities that the accuseds statement is not made

under oath and not subjected to cross-examination.

Held further,

1. If the dock statement is believed, it must be acted upon to.

2. If it raised a reasonable doubt in their minds about the case of the

prosecution, the defence must succeed. and;

3. It must not be used against another accused.

It was held in the case of Don Samantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha Vs. The

Attorney General, C.A. 303/2006, decided on 11-07-2012 that,

Whether the witness of the defence or the dock statement is sufficient to

create a doubt cannot be decided in vacuum or in isolation, because it needs

to be considered in the totality of evidence, that is in the light of the

evidence for the prosecution as well as the defence.

Page 10 of 13

Bearing this in mind, this Court will consider how the Learned Trial Judge

evaluated the dock statement and the evidence of the Defence. The Defence version is

built on the notion that the Accused came to Babar Street to receive money on behalf of a

friend. But as the Learned Trial Judge points out, there is no mention as to who this friend

is, which would be a vital detail in their version. Learned Trial Judge has further

addressed the failure of the Defence to address or even acknowledge vital issues from the

arrest to the production. He further points to a few instances where details in the cross-

examination are absent from the dock statement. Statements of such vague nature do not

invoke confidence in the Accused. In his delivery, the Accused himself appears to seem

uncertain of his story.

As stated in the judgment (on page 224 of the Brief):

... .. 1 .. 2

. . 2 .

. . . . 2

.

.

.

.

.

.

The Learned Trial Judge has correctly given emphasis to the time discrepancy in

D1s evidence. Witnesses are not expected to have exact knowledge of the event, especially

years after the incident, but this particular discrepancy becomes relevant as it creates

severe doubt about the Defences case. The Learned Trial Judge has observed this to be

an attempt at dishonestly supporting the Defence position which was that the Accused

was arrested at 19.30hrs as opposed to 21.55hrs, which is the version of the Prosecution.

Even if we entertain the possibility of this being an honest mistake, it does not justify the

Defence versions failure to appear coherent in the eyes of the Court. Such evidence not

Page 11 of 13

only fails to make a dent in the Prosecutions case but also renders the Defence version

untrustworthy.

In the case of James Silva v. The Republic of Sr Lanka [1980] 2 SLR 167, his

Lordship Rodrigo J. stated thus:

It is a grave error of law for a trial Judge to direct himself that he must examine

the tenability and truthfulness of the evidence of the defence in the light of the

evidence led by the prosecution. Our criminal law postulates a fundamental

presumption of legal innocence of every accused till the contrary is proved. This is

rooted in the concept of legal inviolability of every individual in our society; now

enshrined in our Constitution. There is not even a surface presumption of truth in

the charge with which an accused is indicted. Therefore, to examine the evidence

of the accused in the light of the prosecution witnesses is to reverse the

presumption of innocence.

A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider all the

matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by the defence in

its totality without compartmentalising and, ask himself whether as a prudent

man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he believes the accused guilty of

the charge or not guilty - see the Privy Council Judgment in Jayasena v The

Queen.

In the instant appeal, we are of the view that the Learned High Court Judge has

rightly considered the dock statement of the Accused and his defence, and has arrived at

the conclusion that the dock statement has not created any reasonable doubt in the

evidence of the prosecution.

During the argument stage, the learned Counsel for the Accused drew this Courts

attention to the amendments made to punishments in the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous

Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 41 of 2022.

The punishment for possessing 2 grammes to less than 3 grammes of heroin

constitutes a fine not less than One Hundred Thousand Rupees and not exceeding Two

Page 12 of 13

Hundred Thousand Rupees and imprisonment of either description for a period not less

than seven years and not exceeding ten years or to both such fine and imprisonment.

After finding the Accused guilty, the learned high court judge sentenced him to life

imprisonment on the judgement dated 12th September 2018. The learned Counsel for the

Accused has contended that the Accused must have the benefit of the reduced punishment

imposed through the Amending Act. He cited the judgment of his Lordship Gurusinghe J.

in Walakada Gamage Priyantha v. Attorney General CA/HCC/261/2014, decided on 19-

01-2023. In the said judgment, his Lordship observed:

At this stage, it is important to be clear on the point that anything stated in this

judgment should not be construed as giving the Amendment Act a retrospective operation

in so far as it creates new offences or provides for enhanced punishment and this court

has not applied the Amended Act retrospectively, but in terms of just and fairness, the

Appellant was given the advantage of the reduced punishment provided by the

Amendment to the Act."

The prohibition of enacting ex post facto laws in terms of Article 13(6) of our

Constitution, which is similar to Article 20(1) of the Indian Constitution, as summarised

by Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne P.C. in his treatise Fundamental Rights in Sri Lanka

(3rd edition at p. 767) is limited to:

The conviction for an act or omission which did not amount to an offence at the

time of such act or offence and the imposition of a penalty more severe than the penalty

in force at the time offence was committed.

Consequently, a statute that imposes a lighter or lesser penalty (than the penalty

at the time the offence was committed) cannot be considered an ex post facto law within

the ambit of Article 13(6).

Although this Court is inclined to go down that path of fairness and construe the

provision to the benefit of the Accused, Section 7 of the Amending Act puts a spoke in our

wheel. This Section reads:

Page 13 of 13

For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the provisions of section 6

[which sets out the lighter punishment] shall not apply in respect of an offence which was

committed prior to the date of coming into operation of this Act. [emphasis added]

As the legislative intention is manifested in clear and unequivocal terms, to

disregard it in the interests of justice would be to enter murky constitutional waters.

Therefore, regrettably, this Court has no authority to confer the benefit of the lesser

sentence upon the Accused.

This Court is of the view that the grounds of appeal raised by the Accused are

without merit. We see no reason to interfere with the judgement dated 12th September

2018. The conviction and the sentence are affirmed and the appeal is accordingly

dismissed.
