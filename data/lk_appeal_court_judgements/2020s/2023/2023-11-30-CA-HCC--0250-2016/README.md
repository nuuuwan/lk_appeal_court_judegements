JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General for committing the offence

as mentioned below.

On or about the 21st of March 2001, the Appellant committed the murder of

Ginasiri Ruwanpura at Polonnaruwa which is an offence punishable under

Section 296 of Penal Code.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Polonnaruwa as the

Appellant opted for a non-jury trial. The prosecution had led 07 witnesses

and marked production P1-09 and closed the case. The Learned High Court

Judge having satisfied that evidence presented by the prosecution warranted

CA/HCC/0250-2016

3

a case to answer, called for the defence and explained the rights of the

accused. The Appellant made a very brief dock statement and closed his

case.

After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High

Court Judge had convicted the Appellant as charged and sentenced him to

death on 25/11/2016.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

had given his consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid

19 pandemic. At the hearing, the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

The Appellant had raised following grounds of appeal on his behalf.

1. The Appellant has not been offered a fair trial.

2. Although PW2 and PW3 contradicted each other, the Learned High

Court Judge considered that evidence corroborating each other.

3. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider Sudden Fight

in his judgement.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

According to PW1 Lal Ranasinghe, he functioned as a prison guard on the

day of the incident. As usual he escorted prisoners to the Polonnaruwa

Magistrate Court with other officers at about 9.00 am. Before the Court

started, while he was talking to his uncle who had come to see him on that

day, he suddenly heard a commotion in front of the Court house. When he

rushed to the place, had seen two persons engaged in a scuffle and a fight.

He had seen the Appellant and the deceased in a scuffle. Immediately he had

gone in search of PW2, who functioned as the Court Officer in the

Polonnaruwa Magistrate Court. As he could not meet the Court officer, he

CA/HCC/0250-2016

4

reverted back to the place of incident but still the scuffle was continuing

between the Appellant and the deceased. At that time the sarong worn by the

Appellant had fallen up to his knees. The witness had seen the Appellant

stabbing the deceased 4-5 times. Thereafter, the deceased had fallen on the

ground.

In the meantime, PW2, Eriyagama had overpowered the Appellant took him

to his custody. When the Appellant was seized, he shouted out saying I am

innocent. The Appellant had dropped the knife on to the ground at that time,

which is six inches long. The Appellant was handed over to another prison

officer Dayaratne by PW2. According to PW1, the deceased was not armed

with any weapon. He had identified the Appellant and the knife during the

trial.

When PW2 reached the place of incident, he had seen lots of people gathered

there. He too had witnessed the scuffle and at the same time he had seen

one person walking towards the Court Complex and the other person was

holding the collar of the shirt of the who was walking towards the Court

Complex. When the witness seized the Appellant, the other person had fallen

on the ground while bleeding. At that time the Appellants sarong was lying

on the ground. After handing over the Appellant to a prison guard, steps were

taken to dispatch the deceased to the Polonnaruwa Hospital. He too had

identified the Appellant and the knife during the trial.

PW3, Rathnasiri, who was guarding the main entrance of the Court Complex

corroborated the evidence given by PW1 and PW2.

PW4 Rasika is the wife of deceased who identified the body at the post

mortem inquiry. According to her, the deceased worked as a person who cuts

trees for the State on contract. The deceased had gone to the Court on the

fateful day to Court to recover rent arrears due to him from 15 shops that he

had given on rent. The Appellant was also one of the defaulters among others.

On a previous occasion the Appellant had gone to the deceaseds house in

his absence and levelled death threats to the deceased.

CA/HCC/0250-2016

PW7 IP Gunasekera from the Polonnaruwa Police Station had visited the

Polonnaruwa Police Station first and inspected the body. Thereafter he had

visited the scene of crime and conducted the investigation. At the place of

incident, he had recovered a blood-stained knife, a shirt pocket, two pressed

cigarettes and three buttons coupled with a sarong. Next, he had proceeded

to arrest the Appellant who was in the custody of the prison officer, recovered

his blood stained, torn, pocket less white shirt. At the Post-Morten, he had

recovered a shirt and a sarong with blood and cut marks.

According to the JMO, PW7 Palitha Yapa, had noted 7 cut and stab injuries

were on the deceaseds body. First and second injuries had been on the

stomach which extended to the large intestines. Fifth injury had been on the

left shoulder and according to the JMO, the above-mentioned injuries are

sufficient in the ordinary cause of nature to cause death. According to the

JMO, the other injuries were categorised as simple injuries. He further

opined; the knife shown to him could have caused all seven injuries. Even if

the deceased was treated within a short span of time the, the deceaseds life

could not have been saved. He confirmed that the death was caused due to

shock and haemorrhage following a stab wound to spleen and by other

wounds.

After calling the defence, the Appellant making a very short dock statement

denied the charge.

It is trite law that the burden of proof is on the prosecution in all criminal

cases.

In The Queen v. K.A. Santin Singho 65 NLR 447 the court held that:

It is fundamental that the burden is on the prosecution. Whether the

evidence the prosecution relies on is direct or circumstantial, the burden

is the same. This burden is not altered by the failure of the appellant to

give evidence and explain the circumstances.

CA/HCC/0250-2016

6

This case rests on direct and circumstantial evidence.

As the grounds of appeal raised by the Appellant are interconnected, all

grounds will be considered together in this appeal.

The right to a fair trial guarantees fair court proceedings. A fair trial means

that the court follows all procedures correctly and treats all parties equally,

so that the trial itself is fair and effective, regardless of the decision and

outcome. The right to a fair trial encompasses requirements for the court

and its constitution as well as procedural guarantees during proceedings.

The Constitution in Sri Lanka expressly guarantees the right to fair trial. The

Article 13(3) which states that; Any person charged with an offence shall be

entitled to be heard, in person or by an attorney-at-law, at a fair trial by a

competent court.

What is meant by the right to a fair trial had been examined by the Supreme

Court in Attorney General Vs. Segulebbe Latheef and Another 2008 (1)

SLR 225; wherein the following had been stated thus;

Like the concept of fairness, a fair trial is also not capable of a clear

definition, but there are certain aspects or qualities of a fair trial that could

be easily identified. The right to a fair trial amongst other things includes

the following. 1. The equality of all persons before the court. 2. A fair and

public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial court or tribunal

established by law. 3. Presumption of innocence until guilt is proven

according to law. 4. The right of an accused person to be informed of

promptly and in detail in a language he understands of the nature and

cause of the charge against him. 5. The right of an accused to have time

and facilities for preparation for the trial. 6. The right to have a counsel and

to communicate with him. 7. The right of an accused to be tried without

much delay 8. The right of an accused to be tried in his presence and to

defend himself or through counsel. 9. The accused has a right to be

informed of his rights. 10. If the accused is in indigent circumstances to

CA/HCC/0250-2016

7

provide legal assistance without any charge from the accused. 11. The

right of an accused to examine or have examined the witnesses against

him and to obtain the evidence and examination of witnesses on his behalf

under the same conditions as witnesses against him. 12. If the accused

cannot understand or speak the language in which proceedings are

conducted to have the assistance of an interpreter. 13. The right of an

accused not to be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilty.

The Learned Presidents Counsel submitted that the Learned High Court

Judge who wrote the judgment has not heard the case but only listened to

the submissions made by the both parties. Thereby contended that the

Appellant has not afforded a fair trial in this case.

When this case came up before the Learned High Court Judge who wrote the

judgment on 03.02.2016, both parties had agreed to adopt the evidence led

up to that point and agreed to continue the case.

Section 48 of the Judicature Act sates as follows:

In the case of death, sickness, resignation, removal from office,

absence from Sri Lanka, or other disability of any Judge before whom

any action, prosecution, proceeding or matter, whether on any inquiry

preliminary to committal for trial or otherwise, has been instituted or

is pending, such action, prosecution, proceeding or matter may be

continued before the successor of such Judge who shall have power to

act on the evidence already recorded by his predecessor, or partly

recorded by his predecessor and partly recorded by him or, if he thinks

fit, to resummon the witness and commence the proceedings afresh:

Provided that where any criminal prosecution, proceeding or matter

(except on an inquiry preliminary to committal for trial) is continued

before the successor of any such judge, the accused may demand that

the witnesses be resummoned and reheard.

CA/HCC/0250-2016

8

In Herath Mudiyanselage Ariyaratne V. Republic of Sri Lanka. (CA

307/2006 [17.7.2013]) where His Lordship Justice Sisira De Abrew said:

' ... I now again turn to the contention that succeeding HCJ in a criminal

trial cannot, under Section 48 of the Judicature Act, continue with the

proceedings recorded before his predecessor. When a HCJ is transferred

from his station he ceases to exercise his jurisdiction in his area and

thereby he suffers from disability to function as HCJ of the area. Thus,

in my view, transfer of a HCJ from a station is covered by the words

'other disability ' in Section 48 of the Judicature Act. '

Therefore, it is clear that the learned High Court Judge who wrote the

judgment had the discretion and the authority to continue with the case.

Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the Appellant has not been afforded a

fair trial in this case.

Any contradiction if proven in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence

Ordinance, can impeach the credibility of the witness and can help in

rejecting the evidence of the prosecution in criminal trials and of the other

side in civil trials. Contradictions have to be proved in accordance with the

procedure prescribed under the Evidence Ordinance, otherwise it would have

no evidentiary value and would not be admissible. A witness can be

contradicted with its previous statements either made by him in writing or

reduced into writing by someone.

For contradiction to be essential and to affect the decision of a trial court,

such contradictions must be material and fundamental. They must create

doubt in the mind of the court to such a degree that the court believes that

the doubt must be resolved in favour of the accused. Therefore, it is very

much important to evaluate the evidence given by the witnesses in a criminal

trial very carefully.

The Learned Presidents Counsel contended that the evidence given by PW1

and PW2 are contradictory which certainly vitiates the conviction in this

case.

CA/HCC/0250-2016

9

In this case, the incident happened in the Court premises where public

attend to resolve their legal disputes through the Court. According to the

evidence given by PW4, deceaseds wife, the deceased too had come to Court

on that day to resolve dispute regarding non-payment of rent to 15 shops

own by him. The Appellant was also one of the persons who defaulted rent

to one of the shops. Hence, both the deceased and the Appellant had come

to Court with a reason.

In this case, PW1 is a prison officer who had escorted suspects to Court on

that day. PW2 is a police officer who functioned as a Court officer on that

day. Both had witnessed the incident when they came to the place of

incident. When PW1 witnessed the incident, he had seen the Appellant and

deceased were grappling each other and the Appellant stabbing the deceased

with a knife 4-5 times.

Although this witness was subjected to a lengthy cross examination the

defence could not contradict him on material points. The marked

contradictions in the evidence creates no doubt at all.

According to PW2, when he came to the place of incident, he had seen the

deceased holding the Appellant by his collar. When he held the Appellant

who was without his sarong, the deceased went few feet ahead and fallen on

the ground facing downwards. At that time, he had seen the deceased

bleeding. The deceased was hospitalized within 15 minutes. Although a

contradiction was marked in his evidence, it too had failed in creating a

doubt in the prosecutions case.

In the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa

(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292 held that,

Witnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling discrepancies

and omissions. When contradictions are marked, the Judge should

direct his attention to whether they are material or not and the witness

should be given an opportunity of explaining the matter...The court

CA/HCC/0250-2016

10

observed further, that human beings are not computers and that it

would be dangerous to disbelieve the witness and reject evidence based

on small contradictions or discrepancies.

Both PW1 and PW2 had given evidence after about 09 years of the incident.

A photographic memory cannot be expected from them. As the defence could

not create a doubt over their evidence, the argument brought by the Learned

Presidents Counsel that the PW1 and PW2 had given contradictory evidence

cannot be sustained.

Next, the Learned Presidents Counsel contended that the Learned High

Court Judge had failed to consider the defence of sudden fight in this case.

It is a trite law that if the defence had not raised any alternative remedy

against the charge, it is the duty of the judge to consider such circumstances

before he could be convicted for the main charge.

In The King v Bellana Vitanage Eddin 41 NLR 345 the court held that:

"In a charge of murder, it is the duty of the judge to put to the jury the

alternative of finding the accused guilty of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder when there is any basis for such a finding in the

evidence on record, although such defence was not raised nor relied

upon by the accused.

In Luvis v. The Queen 56 NLR 442 the court held that:

Having regard to the evidence, the fact that sudden fight was not

specifically raised as a defence did not relieve the trial judge of the duty

of placing before the jury that aspect of the case.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment had very correctly had

considered whether this incident could be brought under exception 1 or 4 of

Section 294 of the Penal Code. This is one step further to the contention

CA/HCC/0250-2016

raised by the Learned Presidents Counsel. The relevant portions are re-

produced below:

Further, the Learned High Court Judge had very correctly considered the

evidence given by PW1, PW2 PW3 and other witnesses and had reached the

conclusion that the Appellant had committed the murder of the deceased on

21.03.2001 at the premises of the Court Complex of Polonnaruwa. Hence,

the grounds of appeal raised by the Appellant have no merit at all.

As the Learned High Court Judge had rightly convicted the Appellant for the

charge levelled against him in the indictment, I affirm the conviction and

dismiss the Appeal of the Appellant.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Polonnaruwa along with the original case record.
