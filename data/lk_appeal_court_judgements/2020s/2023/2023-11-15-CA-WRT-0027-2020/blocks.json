The Petitioners further state that the 4th and 5th Respondents attempted to dispose of valuable flora under the guise of the said unauthorised construction. In the said Partition action, the Petitioners sought an interim injunction against the Respondents restraining the 4th and 5th Respondents from cutting trees and constructing buildings on the land in dispute, whereas the learned District Judge on 16-05-2018 dismissed the said application. Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned District Judge of Kegalle, the Petitioners preferred an appeal to the Civil Appellate High Court of Kegalle in case No. SP/HCCA/KEG/19/2018(LA), whereas the High Court on 02-05-2019 dismissed the said appeal.
