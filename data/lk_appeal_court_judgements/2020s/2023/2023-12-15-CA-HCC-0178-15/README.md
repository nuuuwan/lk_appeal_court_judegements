JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter after referred to as the

Appellant) along with 1st Accused mentioned in the indictment were indicted

by the Attorney General in the High Court of Embilipitiya as follows:

1. The 2nd Accused being a member of an unlawful assembly with persons

unknown to the prosecution, and of which the common object was

Robbery, committed an offence punishable under Section 140 of the

Penal Code.

2. On the same transaction a member or members of unlawful assembly

committed Robbery of money, jewelleries and a mobile phone worth of

CA/HCC-0178/15

3 | P a g e

Rs.494,000/- from Peduru Arachchilage Padmasiri alias Somapala, an

offence punishable under Section 380 to be read with Section 146 of

the Penal Code.

3. The 2nd Accused with others unknown to the prosecution committed

Robbery of money, jewelleries and a mobile phone worth of

Rs.494,000/- from Peduru Arachchilage Padmasiri alias Somapala, an

offence punishable under Section 380 to be read with Section 32 of the

Penal Code.

4. The 1st Accused knowingly it was a stolen property, possessed a mobile

phone which was Sony Ericsson made and thereby committed an

offence punishable under Section 394 of the Penal Code.

The prosecution had closed the case after calling 14 witnesses and marking

production P1-2. When the Learned High Court Judge called for the defence,

the Appellant and the 1st Accused had made dock statements. Additionally,

the Appellant had called three witnesses on his behalf.

The Learned High Court Judge, after considering the evidence presented by

both parties, convicted the Appellant as charged and imposed following

sentences:

1st Count- 06 months rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.5000/- with a

default sentence of 06 months simple imprisonment.

2nd Court 03 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.5000/- with a

default sentence of 01-year simple imprisonment.

The sentences imposed above are to run concurrently.

The 1st Accused was acquitted from the 4th charge solely due to the fact that

the mobile phone recovered from him was not a product of Sony Ericsson.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

CA/HCC-0178/15

The Appellant is on bail pending appeal granted by the Learned High Court

Judge.

The Appellant raising solitary ground of appeal contended that the charges

preferred against him by the Hon. Attorney General in the indictment are not

in accordance with the law.

Background of the case.

According to PW3, Nayana Padmakumari, on the day of the incident while

she was sleeping in the early hours a person had come to her room shouted

to raise her hands. When her sister switched on the light, she had seen a tall

person brandishing a gun directed them to go to the hall where her parents

were guarded by some unknown persons. The person who brought her to the

hall not covered his face while others had their faces covered. After about six

months, she identified the Appellant at the identification parade. The group

had robbed a mobile phone a Sony Ericsson model, and gold jewelleries worn

by her and her father.

The witness had identified the Appellant at the identification parade after

taking sometime. Although she identified the Appellant, she said that she

was not very sure about the identity of the Appellant.

PW1, Padmasiri is the head of the family. While he was sleeping, a person

had switch on the light and blind folded him. The persons who entered his

room had covered their faces beyond identification. Hence, he could not

identify anybody at the parade. He had given description of items mentioned

in the indictment.

PW2, Somalatha also narrated the same as PW3 and she too identified the

Appellant at the identification parade. According to her, the identification

parade was held after about 07 months of the incident.

CA/HCC-0178/15

Further, the Counsel for the Appellant strenuously argued that the

prosecution had failed to prove Unlawful Assembly charge beyond

reasonable doubt.

Section 138 of the Penal Code reads as;

An assembly of five or more persons is designated an unlawful assembly

if the common object of the persons

In this case, the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses are not quite

sure whether the assembly consisted of five or more persons.

PW3 in her evidence only referred to four persons and she categorically said

that nobody was seen standing outside of the house at time of the incident

happened. The relevant portions are re-produced below:

PW1 had not identified anybody as he was blind folded immediately after he

fell in the clutches of the Appellant.

Only PW2 referred to the presence of five persons at the time of the offence.

But in the cross examination, this witness had said that the intruders had

switched off the lights immediately after entering to the house. PW1 was

blind folded and the house was in the dark. As such she could not exactly

say how many persons had entered her house at that time.

Considering the evidence given by these witnesses, a serious doubt had been

cast upon the prosecution version about the composition of the unlawful

assembly.

In Rex v Silva (1940) 18 CLW 51 CCA, the Appellants were convicted of:

1. Being members of an unlawful assembly, the common object of which

was to cause serious bodily injury to one Welisarage Rogus Fernando,

did thereby commit an offence under Section 140 of Penal Code.

2. Being members of the said unlawful assembly who in prosecution of

the said common object did commit murder by causing the death of the

said Rogus Fernando, and offence punishable under Sections 146 and

296 of the Penal Code.

CA/HCC-0178/15

7 | P a g e

After the jury returned its verdict Crown Counsel withdrew a third count

in the indictment, which charged the accused that they were acting in

furtherance of a common intention, did commit murder by causing the

death of the said Welisarage Rogus Fernando and that they thereby

committed an offence under Section 296 of the Penal Code read with

Section 32 of the Penal Code.

a) The appeal was based on the main ground that there was no legal proof

of the charge or unlawful assembly. Counsel for the Crown argued that

even if the charge of unlawful assembly and the charge of murder in the

course of the unlawful assembly failed, it was open to the court of

Criminal Appeal to convict the accused or some of them on the 3rd count

that was withdrawn, or

b) to order a new trial, or

c) even if common intention or the existence of an unlawful assembly were

not proved, to convict anyone of the accused against whom an offence

was proved of that offence.

Held: (1) That the evidence established neither the existence of an

unlawful assembly nor a common intention on the part of the accused

to commit murder,

(2) That the fact a conviction under count (3) as framed is not warranted

by the evidence does not preclude the Court of Criminal Appeal from

finding the accused guilty of offences arising out of individual acts

committed by them.

Additionally, the Learned Counsel for the Appellant contended that the 3rd

charge is bad for want of particulars since the charge does not specify the

articles that were alleged to have been stolen.

In this case, as per the evidence of prosecution witnesses, only one mobile

phone had been reported to be stolen. PW3, in her evidence stated that the

stolen phone of her father is a product of Sony Ericson. Further, in her

CA/HCC-0178/15

8 | P a g e

evidence she stated that the phone marked as P1 is not her fathers phone.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment had correctly taken his

cognisance of this fact.

It is quite clear that the intention of the prosecution is to charge the 1st

Accused in this case stating that the production P1 the mobile was the

mobile phone robbed from PW1 by the Appellant and others unknown to the

prosecution. However, if the prosecution is unable to prove it, the benefit of

doubt should be accrued to the Appellant.

The Learned High Court Judge reasons out the below in his judgment, to

find the Appellant guilty.

In a criminal trial the primary task in front of the prosecution is to gather

evidence and to collect this evidence, there must be assumptions which help

to finally get access to the evidence. Hence, these assumptions are based on

the principle of probability. Also, it is a prerequisite in criminal cases to

prove a case beyond reasonable doubt so it further enhances the principle of

Probability. This principle holds a very important role when it comes to

convincing the judge on specific points as higher the probability of the

assumption, higher will be the chances for the jury to get convinced.

In Iswari Prasad v. Mohamed Isa 1963 AIR (SC) 1728 at 1734 it was held

that;

In considering whether evidence given by a witness should be accepted

or not, the court has to examine whether he is, in fact, an interested

witness and to inquire whether the story deposed to by him is probable

and whether it has been shaken in cross-examination. That is -whether

there is a ring of truth surrounding his testimony.

As the prosecution indicted the 1st accused and the Appellant in one and the

same indictment and produced only one mobile phone, and the evidence

revealed that the said mobile phone is not a stolen item, the benefit of doubt

should have been accrued to both of them. Using this piece of evidence to

convict the Appellant and to acquit 1st Accused clearly demonstrates that the

Appellant had been denied a fair trial in this case.

In every criminal case, the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person.

As for the reasons stated above, it is quite clear that the charges levelled

against the Appellant are not proven beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, the

benefit of doubt should be accrued to the Appellant as well.

I therefore, set aside the conviction and the sentence dated 13/08/2015

imposed on the Appellant by the learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya.

Therefore, I acquit him from the charges.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Embilipitiya along with the original case record.
