D.N. Samarakoon, J

The appellant ACL Metals and Alloys (Pvt) Ltd., who is aggrieved by the order of

the Tax Appeals Commission has suggested the questions of law stated below for

the opinion of this court.

(01) Whether the reasons for the determination of the Commissioner General

of Inland Revenue which were transmitted after the time period provided

under section 7(3) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act No. 23 of 2011 are

valid?

(02) Whether the notice of assessment is made within the time provided under

section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006?

(03) Whether the amendment made to section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act

No. 10 of 2006 by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 19 of 2009 is

applicable to the year of assessment 2007/2008?

3 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

(04) Whether the Assessor communicated the reasons in rejecting the return

of income as required by section 163(3) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of

2006?

(05) Whether the phrase industrial and machine tool manufacturing inter alia

appearing in section 17 of the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 can be

interpreted as industrial manufacturing and machine tool

manufacturing?

(06) Whether the investment requirement under section 17 of the Inland

Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 need to be effected/infused on the date of

incorporation of a company to become eligible for the exemption?

The appellant submits in its additional written submissions dated 24th January

2023, that, Questions 02,03,05 and 06 are in substance similar to the main

questions determined by this court in C. A. Tax 07 2013 and in C. A. Tax 09

2013.

The similarities are not exactly as submitted for the appellant. But, it

appears, that the following are the questions determined in those two

appeals.

Question 02 above is substantially the same as the Question 02 in 07 2013 dated

16th March 2022 and Question 02 in 09 2013 dated 09th December 2022.

Question 04 above is substantially the same as the Question 03 in 09 2013

above.

Question 05 above is substantially the same as Question 03 in 07 2013 and

Question 04 in 09 2013.

Question No. 03 is also covered under the Year on Year application of Act No. 10

of 2006 under Question No. 02 in 09 2013.

The appellant in 07 2013 is ACL Cables PLC and that of 09 2013 is ACL Polymers

(Pvt) Limited.

Question No. 01: Whether reasons communicated under section 7(3) of Tax

Appeal Commission Act after the time period are valid?

In respect of this Question the response of the respondent contained at its

written submissions dated 08th June 2018 at page 03 is that as the appellant

intimated its intention to appeal by a letter dated 06.10.2011 which was referred

to the respondent by a letter dated 14.10.2011 and received thereafter; and the

respondent transmitted his reasons for the determination on 16.11.2011, the

communication is within the stipulated time.

If the Tax Appeal Commissions letter dated 14.10.2011 was received by the

respondent on 15.10.2011, the determination is one day out of time.

Section 7(3) says, within thirty days of receipt of the notification. The

Commissions letter, as the respondent says, being dated 14.10.2011 and the

reasons being on 16.11.2011, had the letter dated 14.10.2011 received by the

respondent on 17.10.2011, the reasons are still within time.

There appears to be no admission between parties as to when the letter dated

14.10.2011 was received by the respondent, which the respondent does not

disclose. Therefore it appears to this Court that answering that question is

superfluous.

Question Nos. 02, 03 and 04: Whether the notice of assessment is made

within the time provided under section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act

No. 10 of 2006?

Whether the amendment made to section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act

No. 10 of 2006 by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 19 of 2009 is

applicable to the year of assessment 2007/2008?

Whether the Assessor communicated the reasons in rejecting the return of

income as required by section 163(3) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of

2006?

Section 163 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 is as reproduced below.

5 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

where any person who in the opinion of the Assessor is liable to any

income tax for any of assessment, has not paid such tax or has paid an

amount less than the proper amount which he ought to have paid as such

tax for such year of assessment, an Assessor may, subject to the provisions

of subsection (3) and (5) and after the fifteenth day of November

immediately succeeding that year of assessment, assess the amount which

in the judgment of the Assessor ought to have been paid by such person,

and shall by notice in writing require such person to pay forthwith.

Section 163(5) reads as reproduced below,

Subject to the provisions of section 72, no assessment of the income tax

payable under this Act by any person or partnership

(a) Who or which has made a return of his or its income on or before the

thirtieth day of September of the year of assessment immediately

succeeding that year of assessment, shall be made after the expiry of

eighteen months from the end of that year of assessment; and

(b) ..

The year of assessment relevant to this appeal is year of assessment 2007/2008

Hence the relevant year of assessment begins on 01.04.2007 and ends on

31.03.2008. The period of 18 months stipulated in section 163(5) of the Act has

to be calculated from 31.03.2008 and hence ends on 30.09.2009.

The position of the appellant is that the Notice of Assessment for 2007/2008

which is dated 30.09.2009 was served on the appellant thereafter and in terms

of section 194(3) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, any notice sent by

post is deemed to have been served on the day succeeding the day on which it is

dated1. Hence it is on 01.10.2009 and out of time. It is after the expiry of eighteen

months.

6 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

There is an amendment Act No.19 of 2009 which amended section 163(5) (a)

which substituted eighteen months by two years.

The Inland Revenue (amendment) Act No. 19 of 2009 was endorsed by the

Speaker on 31st March 2009.

As Inland Revenue (amendment) Act No.19 of 2009 was endorsed by the Speaker

on 31.03.2009, it has come into operation after the year of assessment relevant

to this case. The relevant year ended on 31.03.2008.

In CA (TAX) 23/20132 decided by another division of this court on 25.05.2015,

(Judgment of Justice Dehideniya) the respondent, the Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue (who is also the respondent in this appeal) had taken a two fold

argument. It is said at page 3 of the said case. one argument is that the

amendment came into force within the eighteen month period where the

assessor was entitled to send the assessment against the assessee and

therefore the extension of time period is applicable. The other argument is

that it is a procedural law and any change in the procedural law can be

considered as an amendment with retrospective effect.

The first argument aforesaid, if correct, will apply to the year of assessment in

this appeal, because the eighteen month period ended on 30.09.2009 and the

amendment came before that on 31.03.2009. In the said case CA (TAX) 23/2013

it was decided at page 5.

As I have pointed out earlier, the Speaker has endorsed the bill on 31st

March 2009. As per section 27(6) of the Amendment Act, section 163 of

the principal enactment is amended from 1st of April 2009. The amended

section does not apply retrospect. It operates only from the date specified

in it. The law of the country has changed from that date. Therefore, from

that date onwards, the new law shall apply.

7 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

However, the court in that case accepted the second argument of the respondent

in that case on procedural law and held in page 5 itself,

The section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act is a procedural law. It

regulates the procedure of sending an assessment against the assessee by

an assessor in the event that the tax return sent by the assessee is not

accepted by the assessor. Even if the amendment has a retrospective

effect, it applies, if the amendment is only on procedural law. No party can

have vested right on procedure.

The appellant contended in oral arguments that the amendment by Act No.19 of

2009 does not apply to the year of assessment relevant to this appeal because of

the title of the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 which says,

AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE IMPOSITION OF INCOME TAX FOR ANY

YEAR OF ASSESSMENT COMMENCING ON OR AFTER APRIL 1, 2006.

Hence it was submitted that the applicability of the Act is year on year.

Hence it was further submitted that since the amendment Act 19 of 2009 was

certified on 31.03.2009, the amendment to section 163(5) (a) was brought into

force prospectively with effect from 01st April 2009 which is the date on which

the year of assessment 2009/2010 begins. The year of assessment 2007/2008

had already ended.

This is an acceptable argument because the title to the Inland Revenue Act No.10

of 2006 says FOR THE IMPOSITION OF INCOME TAX FOR ANY YEAR OF

ASSESSMENT COMMENCING ON OR AFTER APRIL 1,2006.

Hence it appears that the operations of Act is year on year. The intention of the

legislature appears to be to enact the law on the basis of separate years of

assessment.

Hence this court cannot accept the argument on procedural law which was

accepted in CA TAX 23/2013. In fact, in that case itself at page 6 it is stated,

8 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes, 12th edition page 222 says;

The presumption against retrospective construction has no

application to enactments which affect only the procedure and practice of

courts. No person has a vested right in any course of procedure, but only

the right of prosecution or defence in the manner prescribed for the time

being by or for the Court in which he sues, and if an Act of Parliament

alters that mode of procedure, he can only proceed according to the altered

mode. Alterations in the form of procedure are always retrospective, unless

there is some good reason or other why they should not be. (emphasis

added in this judgment)

In that case the court also has said at page 6 itself,

Bindra at page 1469 refers to Grander v. Lucas [1878] 3 AC 582 p. 603

and cites;

It is perfectly settled that if the legislature intended to frame a new

procedure that instead of proceeding in this form or that, you should

proceed in another and a different way, clearly then bygone transactions

are to be sued and enforced according to the new form of procedure.

Alterations in the form of procedure are always retrospective, unless there

is some good reason or other why they should not be. (emphasis added

in this judgment)

It is further stated in that page, Then he goes to explain the citation;

In other words, if a statute deals merely with the procedure in

an action, and does not affect the rights, the new procedure will prima

facie apply to all such proceedings as well as future. No party has a vested

right to a particular procedure or to a particular forum. All procedural laws

are retrospective, unless the legislature expressly says that they are not.

Hence, when a suit of or proceeding comes on for hearing or disposal, the

9 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

procedural law in force at that time must be applied. (emphasis added in

this judgment)

The Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 operating year on year is a good reason

as to why an amendment which was certified on 31.03.2009 would operate from

01st April 2009 to the year of assessment 2009/2010 and not to the former years

of assessment. Furthermore, due to this year on year operation of the Act it

cannot be said that it deals merely with the procedure because within the year

of operation it vests rights.

In appeal to the Supreme Court in respect of C.A. (TAX) 23/2013, the

Supreme Court in the judgment of S.C. Appeal No. 46/2016 dated

16.12.2021 has said at page 17,

As stated above, the purpose of the amendment made to section

163(5)(a) read with section 106(1) of the principal Act was not only to grant

additional time for an assessor to consider the return of income filed by

the taxpayer and make an assessment (if necessary), but also to grant

additional time for a taxpayer to prepare a return of income in compliance

with the said Act.

If the amendments made to section 163(5)(a) read with section 106(1) of

the principal Act are interpreted to apply to the year of assessment

2007/2008 with retrospective effect, the taxpayers are deprived of filing

income tax returns for such year of assessment within the extended time

period, as such extended time period has passed by the time the said

amendments came into operation. Thus such an interpretation defeats the

purpose of the aforesaid amendment.

Accordingly it is necessary to give prospective effect to both of the aforesaid

amendments in order to give effect to the purpose of legislation.

The Supreme Court has therefore set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal

in C. A. (TAX) 23/2013.

10 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

The extension given to the assessor by an amendment not being afforded to the

assessee, will not arise, if it is decided that the application of the Act is year on

year.

In the present case3, in oral arguments on 24.01.2022, the respondent has taken

another argument which it appears had not been taken in CA (TAX) 23/2013.

That is that the time bar focuses on the date of making the assessment and not

sending the assessment. It was contended that the Act provides separate

provisions for making of assessments and sending of Notice of Assessments and

whereas the legislature has intentionally provided a time frame for making the

assessment it has intentionally not provided a time frame for sending the Notice

of assessment.

In this regard the case Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Chettinad

Corporation Ltd., 55 NLR 553 at 556 was cited.

In that case Gratiaen J., said,

The distinction between an assessment and a notice of assessment

is thus made clear: the former is the departmental computation of the

amount of tax with which a particular assessee is considered to be

chargeable and the latter is the formal intimation to him of the fact that

such an assessment has been made.

If this argument is accepted, it means that the assessor only has to make the

assessment within the stipulated time but he can indefinitely delay the sending

of the Notice of Assessment.

But as it was seen section 163(1) refers to assess the amount and shall by

notice in writing require such person to pay forthwith .. section 163(1)

also says subject to the provisions of subsection (3) and (5).

3 In Tax 09 2013.

11 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

This shows that the duty to assess is not only coupled with the duty to serve

notice in writing but both are subject to the provisions of subsection (3) and (5)

of section 163 of the Act.

As I have said in John Keels Holding PLC vs. Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue, C. A. Tax 26/2013, the first case in which I considered this question,

dated 17th March 2022, at page 31,

Furthermore, E. Goonaratne, says in INCOME TAX IN SRI LANKA, first

edition at page 393, Making an assessment culminates in the notice

on the person assessed. An assessment is made when the assessment is

sent.

If not the assessor will be able to make an assessment even after the stipulated

period and send Notice of Assessment to the assessee. If the assessee takes the

position that the assessment was not made within the prescribed time the

assessor will be free to produce a document made after the prescribed time but

incorrectly bears a date within the prescribed time as evidence of making the

assessment.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant in oral arguments on

13.07.2021 referred to4 section 194 (2) proviso and section 194 (3). Those

provisions are as reproduced below.

194 (2) Every notice given by virtue of this Act may be served on

a person either personally or by being delivered at, or sent by post to, his

last known place of abode or any place at which he is, or was during the

year to which the notice relates, carrying on business:

Provided that a notice of assessment under section 163 shall

be served personally or by registered letter sent through the post to any

such place as aforesaid.

4 In tax 09 2013

12 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

(3) any notice sent by post shall be deemed to have been served on

the day succeeding the day on which it would have been received in

the ordinary course by post.

Hence the appellant argues that the provisions demonstrate the timing when the

Notice of Assessment is deemed to be served and it is so because the time of

service is material. The appellant questions that if it were otherwise why would

the legislature make such specific provisions relating to the deemed time of

serving Notice of Assessment. If it were not intended to be adhered to and if the

assessment was not to be made and served simultaneously there is no reason

for the existence of such provisions.

This shows that the contention of respondent that once the assessment

is made Notice of Assessment can be served at any time later is not valid.

The appellant also cites at paragraph 47 of the Written Submissions, C.I.T.

Bombay vs. Khemchand Ramdas (1938) 6 ITR 414,423 (PRIVY Council)

which is cited in Law and Practice of Income Tax by Dinesh Vyas, 9th edition,

Volume II at page 1741 where it says,

The method prescribed by the Act for making an assessment to

tax- using the word assessment in its most comprehensive sense as

including the whole procedure for imposing liability upon the taxpayer-

consists of the following steps. In the first place, the taxable income of the

assessee has to be computed. In the next place, the sum payable by him

on the basis of such computation has to be determined. Finally, a notice

of demand in the prescribed form specifying the sum so payable has to be

served on the assessee.

The parties have also referred to case No. C. A. (TAX) 17/20175 decided by

another division of this court on 15.03.2019. In that case the appellant had filed

his return for the year of assessment 2009/2010 by 30th November 2010. It

5 Stafford Motor Company (Private) Limited vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

13 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

appears that the said division of this court had two questions to be determined

in regard to the question of time bar pertaining to the making of the assessment.

One is whether the applicable date for time bar is the date of making the

assessment or the date of notice of assessment. The other is whether the two

year period [unlike in the present case where the period of time bar is eighteen

months, in that case it was two years since the Amending Act No. 19 of 2009

had come into force] end in counting two periods of 365 days or on two calendar

years.

In regard to the first question the court decided that the applicable date for the

time bar is the date of making the assessment. It said at page 08 of the

judgment,

The time bar to making an assessment is set out in section 163(5) of

the 2006 Act. The section clearly states that no assessment shall be

made after the time specified therein. Given that the 2006 Act recognizes

a distinction between an assessment and a notice of assessment, it

would have been convenient for the legislature to refer to the notice of

assessment rather than assessment in section 163(5) of the 2006 Act.

On the contrary it has been made effective for the making of an

assessment. Therefore court rejects the submission that the date of

posting of the notice of assessment is the relevant date for the purpose

of determining the time bar for making an assessment. Court determines

that the date of making the assessment is the relevant date for the purpose

of determining the time bar.

The court cited Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Chettinad Corporation Ltd.,

55 NLR 553 at 556, where Gratiaen J., said,

The distinction between an assessment and a notice of assessment

is thus made clear: the former is the departmental computation of the

amount of tax with which a particular assessee is considered to be

14 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

chargeable and the latter is the formal intimation to him of the fact that

such an assessment has been made.

Perusal of that judgment of Gratiaen J., shows that the aforesaid passage merely

refer to an assessment and a notice of assessment whereas it is clear even

without citing the said passage that there are two distinct words as assessment

and a notice of assessment. In other words, to say that assessment is different

from notice of assessment the aforesaid passage is not required. But whether

an assessment to be a valid one it should actually accompany with a notice of

assessment is a deeper question.

As the court said in C. A. (TAX) 17/2017 aforesaid, it found Chettinad

Corporation judgment, from reference made to it in Ismail vs. Commissioner of

Inland Revenue (1981) 2 SLR 78, cited in that case by the appellant. That is a

case decided by the Court of Appeal on a writ application where the main

question for decision was whether reasons must be mandatorily given for the

rejection of a return of income tax. The appellant in that case had also cited the

appeal of Ismail vs. Commissioner of Inland Revenue 1981 to the Supreme

Court which is D.M.S. Fernando and another vs. Ismail 1982 1 SRL 222. The

Supreme Court by a majority of 03 to 02 held that such reasons are mandatory

upholding the decision of the Court of Appeal, on that point.

The division of this court in C. A. (TAX) 17/2017 then cited Cross on Precedents

and another authority on ratio decidendi and obiter dictum and decided that

neither the Court of Appeal in Ismail vs. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

1981, nor the Supreme Court in D.M.S. Fernando vs. Ismail 1982 have decided

any question that came for decision in C. A. (TAX) 17/2017 and hence those

cases are not binding authorities. This is correct on a perfunctory analysis. But

those two cases decided in early 1980s are important since in those cases

the superior courts of this country examined in detail the procedures

followed by the Inland Revenue Department in estimating, assessing,

15 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

sending notice of assessment and giving reasons for non acceptance of the

return.

The division of this court in coming to the aforementioned decision in C. A. (TAX)

17/2017 that the effective date for the commencement of the time bar is the

date of assessment has based its decision on the English case of Honig and

others vs. Sarsfield (Inspector of Taxes) (1986) BTC 205.

The division of this court observed, having referred to that case, that Fox L.J.,

drew a distinction in making of an assessment and the notice of assessment and

held them to be different, the assessment being no way dependent on the service

of notice. The division of this court said, He (Fox L. J.) held that giving of the

notice is independent of the making of a valid and independent assessment.

As already said in the present judgment, the passage quoted from the Chettinad

case having shed no additional light to the decision contained in C. A. (TAX)

17/2017, it appears that the entire decision to base the effective date for the

commencement of time bar on the date of assessment has been based on Honig

and others vs. Sarsfield (Inspector of Taxes) (1986) BTC 205.

In the law report of Honig and Others (administrators of Emmanuel Honig)

vs. Sarsfield (H. M. Inspector of Taxes) Reported (Ch.D) [1985] STC 31; (CA)

[1986] STC 246 it is said,

.A back duty enquiry was instituted in 1970 and, on 16th March

1970, an Inspector of Taxes signed a certificate in volume 1 of his District

Assessment books stating that he had made assessments on the

administrators for the years 1960-61 to 1966-67 inclusive. The notices of

assessment were issued on 16th March 1970, but did not reach the

administrators until after 07th April 1970. It was common ground that the

assessments would be out of time unless made before 06th April 1970 by

reason of the provisions of section 34 and section 40(1) of the Taxes

Management Act of 1970. The administrators appealed.

16 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

The Special Commissioners held that (1) the assessments were made on

16th March 1970, when a duly authorized Inspector signed the certificate

in volume 1. They were therefore not out of time; (2) the increases to the

assessments contended for by the Inspector were supportable. They did

not accept the oral evidence of the son, M. Honig, one of the

administrators, that the increases in capital disclosed by the statements

were attributable to rental income arising to the son, not the deceased.

The Chancery Division, dismissing the appeal, held that on the first point,

it was clear on a proper construction of sections 29 and 114 of the Taxes

Management Act of 1970, that the making of the assessment was not

dependent on the service of the notice of assessment. The Special

Commissioners were plainly right to hold that the assessments were made

on 16th March 1970 and so within the time limit prescribed by sections 34

and 40 (1) of that Act. On the second point, there was no possible ground

on which the court could hold that the Special Commissioners conclusion

was perverse; there was ample evidence before them on which to make

their findings of fact.

The administrators appealed to the Court of Appeal on the first point only,

namely the date when the assessments were made.

Held, in the Court of Appeal, dismissing the appeal, that the assessments

were made on 16th March 1970 when the Inspector of Taxes signed the

certificate in volume 1 of the assessment book.

Thus it is clear that the procedure in England was different. The assessment was

made when the Inspector of Taxes authorized to make such assessment signs

the certificate in the assessment book. It is because under the Taxes

Management Act of 1970 the Inspector of Taxes was obliged to maintain an

assessment book. In this country the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 does

not require the assessor or the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to maintain

such a register.

17 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

Hence the argument of the respondent in the present case that the effective date

for the commencement of the time bar is the date of making the assessment

and not the date of sending the notice could have been accepted if there was a

book or a register maintained by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue which will

be evidence of the date of making of assessment.

It is said at page 09 of C. A. (TAX) 17/2017 that,

The question that arose for determination in Ismail vs. Commissioner

of Inland Revenue and D.M.S. Fernando and another vs. Ismail is whether

the duty imposed on the assessor in terms of section 93(2) of the Inland

Revenue Act No. 04 of 1963 as amended is mandatory and whether that

duty has been complied with. The relevant provision is similar to section

163(3) of the 2006 Act which requires an assessor to give reasons in

writing to a person whose return has not been accepted by him. Both

courts held that it was mandatory. The Supreme Court (by majority) held

that the reasons must be communicated at or about the time the assessor

sends his assessment on the estimated income.The question of whether

the time bar for making an assessment applies to the making of

assessment or the notice of assessment did not arise for determination in

those cases.

Section 93(2)6 provided that where a person has furnished a return of

income, wealth or gifts, the assessor may.if he does not accept the return

estimate the amount of assessable income, taxable wealth or taxable gifts

of such person and assess him accordingly. (page 166 of Ismail vs.

Commissioner of Inland Revenue 1981)

But as the passage quoted from C. A. (TAX) 17/2017 said, section 163(3) of the

2006 Act requires the assessor, if the return of income tax was not accepted, to

give reasons in writing. Section 93(2) of Act No. 04 of 1963, as it originally

stood, did not require the assessor to give reasons. It was by an amendment

brought by Law No. 30 of 1978 that sections 93(2)(b) and 96(c)(3) were

amended thus including a requirement of giving reasons when the assessor

decides to reject a return of income tax.

It was said that in C. A. (TAX) 17/2017 the division of this court decided that

Ismail vs. Commissioner of Inland Revenue 1981 has not decided the

question of time bar. But that case has analysed the procedure to be followed

when an assessor decides not to accept a particular return.

Justice Victor Perera in Ismail vs. Commissioner of Inland Revenue 1981

said,

Before I deal with the changes brought about by the amendment of the

Revenue Law, No. 30 of 1978, I would refer to the bounds within which an

Assessor could have rejected and substituted his own assessment under

section 93 and section 94 of the Inland Revenue Law prior to 1978. The

courts have considered the far reaching arbitrary powers granted to an

Assessor under the existing law in several cases and have from time to

time commented on the improper approach made by assessors in

exercising those powers. The areas of dispute between an assessor and

assessee would necessarily revolve around the reasons of the Assessor

for, and the basis of his making the arbitrary assessment of income

or wealth. But the assessee was completely in the dark in regard to the

reasons or basis for not accepting the return even when the notice of

assessment was served on him under section 95. An assessee, when he

filed his appeal could therefore not formulate his grounds of appeal except

in general terms. However, under the provisions dealing with the appeal

in section 97 (2) he was obliged to set out the precise grounds of such

appeal and necessarily he had to confine himself to such grounds when

19 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

the appeal was considered by the Commissioner. (page 94-95 of the

judgment7)

Although Justice Victor Pereras reasoning, that reasons for not accepting the

return should precede sending of the notice of assessment was refuted by the

learned Chief Justice in appeal, in D.M.S. Fernando vs. Mohideen Ismail, the

learned Chief Justice expressed similar views as to the purpose of giving reasons,

which was introduced by amendment of revenue law effected by law No. 30 of

1978. His Lordship said,

The primary purpose of the amending legislation is to ensure that the

Assessor will bring his mind to bear on the return and come to a definite

determination whether or not to accept it. It was intended to prevent

arbitrary and grossly unfair assessments which many Assessors had been

making as a protective measure". An unfortunate practice had

developed where some Assessors, due to pressure of work and other

reasons, tended to delay looking at a return till the last moment and

then without a proper scrutiny of the return, made a grossly

exaggerated assessment. The law, I think, enabled the department to

make recoveries pending any appeal on such assessments. The overall

effect of this unhappy practice was to pressurise the tax payer to such an

extent that he was placed virtually at the mercy of the tax authorities. The

new law was a measure intended to do away with this practice. Under the

amendment when an Assessor does not accept a return, it must mean that

at the relevant point of time he has brought his mind to bear on the return

and has come to a decision rejecting the return. Consequent to this

rejection, the reasons must be communicated to the Assessee. The

provision for the giving of reasons and the written communication of the

reasons, contained in the amendment, is to ensure that in fact the new

procedure would be followed. More particularly the communication of the

20 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

reasons at the relevant time is the indication of its compliance. The new

procedure would also have the effect of fixing the Assessor to a

definite position and not give him latitude: to chop and change

thereafter. It was therefore essential that an Assessor who rejects a return

should state his reasons and communicate them. His reasons must be

communicated at or about the time he sends his assessment on an

estimated income. Any later communication would defeat the remedial

action intended by the amendment.

It may be noted that when the learned Chief Justice said, His reasons must be

communicated at or about the time he sends his assessment on an estimated

income, His Lordship referred as sends his assessment to the sending of the

notice of assessment, since the assessment without the notice, [the document

in the possession of the assessor] which is just the estimate itself is not sent.

Justice Victor Perera in the Court of Appeal said,

Up to 1978, therefore, the position was that an Assessor could under

the law act arbitrarily though he was expected to act according to the

principles of justice and fair play, honestly to come to a conclusion on the

basis of existing material and to exercise his judgment with responsibility.

When the Assessor did form such a judgment, the burden is shifted

on the assessee to displace the assessment he had decided to make,

according to his judgment. But still as the law stood, the taxpayer was

given no opportunity to know beforehand the reasons for not accepting a

return or the basis of an estimate made against him nor had he an

opportunity of setting out the grounds of an appeal precisely, if he decided

to lodge an appeal. (page 978)

Hence when there was no obligation to give reasons also, once the assessor forms

his judgment, the burden shifted on the assessee.

The learned Chief Justice also said,

Furthermore one has to consider this amendment in the light of the law

as it then existed. The Assessor was then not bound to disclose any

reasons either on the file or by communication to the Assessee. All was left

to the good sense of the Assessor and his sense of justice and fairness. The

Assessee could only appeal against the quantum of assessment and the

onus of proof lay on the Assessee. He could only speculate on the

reasons for such assessment for the purposes of his appeal. The picture is

now different. A duty is now imposed on the Assessor not only to give

reasons for non-acceptance of a return but also to communicate them to

the Assessee.

Justice Victor Perera further said,

The amended section 93, sub-section (2) imposed a duty on the Assessor

who rejected a return furnished by any person to communicate to such

person in writing the reasons for not accepting the return. This section

clearly dealt with the assessment of income, wealth and gifts, the rejection

of a return and a communication had to be done before the notice of

assessment stating the amount of the assessment of income, wealth and

gifts and the amount of the tax charged is sent under section 95. (page 99)

The learned Chief Justice said,

At this stage it would be convenient to deal with the opinion of Perera J.

that the amending law clearly contemplated that the notice

communicating the reasons for not accepting of a return should be an

exercise before the actual assessment of income, wealth or gifts is made

for the purpose of sending the Statutory Notice of Assessment referred to

22 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

in Section 95. I have quoted him verbatim because it appears to me that

he considered this communication to be a condition precedent to making

an estimate of assessable income. Perera J. was of the view that the intent

of the provision was to give the Assessee an opportunity to meet the

Assessor-so as to convince him, if possible, that his non-acceptance was

erroneous.

Justice Victor Perera continued,

The amending law clearly contemplated that the notice

communicating the reasons for not accepting of a return should be

an exercise before the actual assessment of income, wealth or gifts is

made for the purpose of sending the statutory notice of assessment

referred to in section 95. No useful purpose would be served if the

notices communicating the reasons for non-acceptance of a return

are sent simultaneously or at any time after the notice of assessment is

issued under section 95. The purpose of communicating the reasons for

the rejection of a return could only be for the purpose of giving the

taxpayer an opportunity before he receives the statutory notice of

assessment under section 95, to put the assessee in possession of full

particulars of the case he is expected to meet, in order that he could

assist the Assessor if he does not accept the return to reconsider his

rejection if satisfactory reasons are urged by the assessee before the

final assessment is made. (page 99-1009)

It is to be noted that Justice Victor Perera uses the term notice

interchangeably to mean notice communicating the reasons and the

notice of assessment sent under section 95, which he sometimes referred

to as statutory notice of assessment. Whenever he referred to the notice of

assessment, in the aforequoted passage it is reproduced in plain (not bold)

9 Copy available in Lawnet website

letters. The notice in bold italics has referred to the notice of giving reasons.

Why Victor Perera J., has opined that notice of giving reasons must be before

the notice of assessment was to give an opportunity for the tax payer to fully

enlighten the assessor, prior to the charge sent in the statutory notice of

assessment. It is correct that this position of having to send notice of giving

reasons prior to the statutory notice of the assessment [which appears to be

based on very sound logic] was changed in the Supreme Court. But even the

decision of the majority in the Supreme Court, where the lead judgment was

written by the learned Chief Justice shows that the Supreme Court also

appreciated the difference between the notice of giving reasons and the statutory

notice of the assessment, without which there is only an estimate and not a

valid assessment.

The learned Chief Justice also said,

Even if one transposes the words and communicate to such persons in

writing the reasons for not accepting the return to the first, line of the

section after the word return and before the word estimate it will not

make it a condition precedent. (page 227)

His Lordship continued,

The section imposes a duty but does not impose a time limit within

which it should be done. To my mind the section merely states that if the

Assessor does not accept a return he may assess on an estimate.

In the aforequoted two passages one can see the learned Chief Justice did not

accept the proposition of Justice Victor Perera that the notice of giving reasons

should precede the statutory notice of assessment. But what is significant is to

note that the learned Chief Justice said, To my mind the section merely states

that if the Assessor does not accept a return he may assess on an estimate.

What is an estimate was defined by the judgment of Justice Victor Perera. It is

given below. It was not altered by the majority judgment of the Supreme Court.

24 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

Justice Victor Perera defined the term estimate as,

According to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary 'estimate' means an

'approximate calculation based on probabilities' and therefore the

'estimate' becomes the basis of the assessment of the taxable income. This

was the definition adopted by Canakaratne, J. in the case of Silva v.

Commissioner of Income Tax, ! 1) at page 340.

Thus, if the assessor does not accept a return he may assess on an estimate,

means he may make an approximate calculation based on probabilities. It can

become the basis of the assessment of the taxable income, as the passage of

Justice Victor Perera further said. But it can never become an assessment [in

the sense of a valid assessment] without it being sent with the statutory notice

of assessment.

Hence it appears that although the learned Chief Justice did not agree with

Justice Victor Perera, that giving reasons must be prior to the sending of notice

of assessment, both justices agreed on several salient points, such as,

(a) An assessor could arrive at an arbitrary decision since he was not bound

to disclose any reasons,

(b) The assessee was kept in the dark and hence was in a position of

disadvantage when he has to appeal against a notice of assessment,

(c) Once the assessor forms his judgment, the burden shifts on to the

assessee,

(d) The purpose of the amendment brought by law No. 30 of 1978 was to

remedy the aforesaid position,

(e) Both Judges considered that the making of an assessment is

synonymous with the giving of statutory notice (not the reasons) of

assessment. [Eg. the actual assessment of income, wealth or gifts is

made for the purpose of sending the statutory notice of assessment

referred to in section 95]

25 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

(f) In any event, the giving of reasons cannot be after the sending of notice of

assessment,

(g) If giving reasons is after the sending of notice the purpose of the

amendment by law No. 30 of 1978 will be defeated

Hence whereas Justice Victor Perera said giving reasons should precede sending

notice of assessment, the learned Chief Justice said His reasons must be

communicated at or about the time he sends his assessment on an-estimated

income10. He further said, Any later communication would defeat the

remedial action intended by the amendment. Hence whereas the Court of

Appeal said giving reasons must precede notice of assessment and the Supreme

Court said reasons can be given at the time of the notice of assessment, both

courts agreed that giving reasons cannot be after the sending of the notice of

assessment, which both courts considered as synonymous with making the

assessment.

Hence although it is correct to say that both the aforesaid cases [Ismail vs.

Commissioner of Income Tax, as well as D.M.S. Fernando vs. Ismail] were not on

the point whether making the assessment as well as giving notice of

assessment, must be within the stipulated time period, they both took it for

granted, in their analysis of the procedure, that making the assessment is same

as giving notice of assessment. Whereas Justice Victor Perera said that giving

reasons for non acceptance of the return should precede the notice of

assessment, the learned Chief Justice said that reasons should be sent at or

about the time of giving notice of assessment and any later communication

would defeat the remedial action intended by the amendment.

Therefore both Justice Victor Perera and the learned Chief Justice have

based their judgments on the premise that making the assessment is

same as giving notice of assessment. This was why it had been argued in

C.A. (Tax) 17/2017 that no lawfully valid assessment can be made without first

10 Statutory Notice

26 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

serving a valid notice of assessment. The Division of this court in C.A. (Tax)

17/2017 thought that this is a practical impossibility. A letter cannot be sent

without it being written. But what was meant is not this. The argument of the

appellant is that an assessment becomes valid only when the notice is given.

This position was the basis of Ismail vs. Commissioner of Income Tax as well

as D.M.S. Fernando vs. Ismail, despite those two cases were concerned with

the duty to give reasons. The position of the appellant is that an assessment

is no assessment until notice of assessment is given. The position could have

been otherwise, viz., an assessment could have been a valid assessment, as

soon as an estimate is made, if like in Honig (administrators of Emmanuel

Honig) vs. Sarsfield (H.M. Inspector of Taxes) the Commissioner of Inland

Revenue also maintained a register in which an assessment is entered. The

register which is a public document. In the absence of such a procedure in

this country, it cannot be accepted that the making of an assessment without

giving notice of assessment is a valid assessment. Hence notice of assessment

must be given to make the assessment validly made for the purpose of the

stipulated time period.

The case of Philip Upali Wijewardene (Appellant) vs. C. Kathiragamer and

another (Respondent) decided in 1992, was cited by the respondents at

paragraph 36 of the Written Submissions and it has to be considered. The facts

and the decision in that case is summarized as given below.

Assessment for the years of assessment 1972/73, 1973/74, 1974/75, 1975/76

were dated 29.03.1979 and received by the assessee on 04.04.1979. Section 96

(c) of the Inland Revenue Act as amended by Act 30 of 1978 states that no

assessment of income tax or wealth tax or gift tax for the Y/A 01st April 1972 01st

April 1973 and 01st April 1974 shall be made after 31st March 1979. The aforesaid

assessments were dated 29.03.1979. Therefore they were made within the

stipulated time.

27 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

Purportedly following the Supreme Court case of D.M.S. Fernando vs. Ismail

1982 (1) SLR 272, W.N.D. Perera J., said,

Communication of reasons for rejecting a return is mandatory and has to be

done at or about the time, an assessment is made on an estimated income. In

the instant case the assessments have been sent to the assessee at or about the

time, the assessments were made. There is therefore substantial compliance with

the requirement of the law.

The said judgment cannot be accepted for two reasons, one is intrinsic whereas

the other is extrinsic. D.M.S. Fernando vs. Mohideen Ismail 1982 and the Court

of Appeal decision on which it was based, Ismail vs. Commissioner of Income

Tax 1981, dealt with the question whether giving reasons for not accepting a

return is mandatory. Both courts decided that it was mandatory. The Court of

Appeal decided that reasons must be given before sending the notice of

assessment. The Supreme Court decided that the reasons can be given at or

about the time when the notice of assessment is sent. It is from that decision

the court in Philp Upali Wijewardene (appellant) vs. C. Kathiragamer and

another in 1992 has taken the phrase at or about the time. The Supreme

Court in D.M.S. Fernando vs. Mohideen Ismail 1982 did not say that notice

or the assessment can be sent at or about the time. This intrinsic defect is

even seen in the last quoted passage from Justice W.N.D. Pereras judgment. In

the aforequoted passage the first sentence refers to reasons while the second

sentence refers to the assessment. Please see the highlighting of the second

quotation from the judgment. This is, with respect, the inherent defect in that

decision. The extrinsic reason for the inability of this court to apply that decision

lies in the difference between the relevant revenue legislations then and now.

The case of Philp Upali Wijewardene (appellant) vs. C. Kathiragamer and

another (respondent) 1992 was decided on Inland Revenue Act No. 04 of 1963

as amended by Inland Revenue (amendment) Law No. 30 of 1978. The said

amendment dealt with the duty to give reasons for not accepting the return

28 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

which was not a requirement in the law as existed prior to the said amendment.

Giving of the notice was referred to in section 95(1) of the Act which said,

(1) An Assessor shall give notice of assessment to each person who has been

assessed stating the amount of income, wealth or gifts assessed and the

amount of tax charged.

Hence a separate provision dealt with the duty to give notice of assessment. But

in the present Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, the same provision deals with

the making of the assessment and giving notice of assessment while both

requirements operate subject to the provision that stipulate the time limit.

The early case of COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX v. SAVERIMUTTU

CHETTY (1937) 39 NLR 01, offers evidence of how the process of assessment

worked in practice, at a time when Income Tax Ordinance No. 02 of 1932 was

only four years old and also at an age where there was no duty to give reasons

for non acceptance of the return. The judgment of Abrahams C. J. said,

This is a case stated by the Board of Review under section 74 of the

Income Tax Ordinance, No. 2 of 1932. The facts, so far as they are material

to the consideration of the point of law on which the case has been stated,

are as follows:- M. Saverimuttu Chetty, who may be called for convenience

the assessee, was originally assessed for Income Tax for the year of

assessment 1934-1935 on the basis that his assessable income was Rs.

9,413, and his taxable income was Rs. 4,913. Upon his taxable income he

was called upon to pay Rs. 245.65 as income tax. His taxable income was

reached by deducting certain allowances amounting to Rs. 4,500. The

assessee appealed against this assessment of the Commissioner of Income

Tax under the provisions of section 69 (1) of the Ordinance, which enable

any person aggrieved by an assessment made under this Ordinance to

appeal to the Commissioner within twenty one days from the date of the

notice of such assessment. This must be done by what the section calls a

"notice of objection". The Commissioner, acting under section 69 (2) of the

Ordinance, directed the assessor to make further inquiry. By virtue of the

provisions of this sub-section an agreement may be reached as to amount

at which the assessee is liable to be assessed, and this in fact happened,

and, as a result, the assessable income was assessed at Rs. 8,745, the

taxable income at Rs. 2,496, and the income tax payable was reduced to

Rs. 124.80 This revision was effected by an allowance to the assessee of

the sum of Rs. 1,749 as earned income allowance under the provisions of

section 16 (1) (b) of the Ordinance.

The judgment further said,

Section 69 of the Ordinance contemplates the following procedure

whereby an assessee who has been wrongly assessed in any respect can

obtain a redress of his grievance. He can file an objection in writing to the

assessment. This done, the Commissioner may direct an assessor to make

further inquiry and the assessor and the assessee may between

themselves settle the matter or, in the language of sub-section (2) to

section 69, make the "necessary adjustment" as a result of their

agreement. If no agreement is reached, the Commissioner hears the appeal

and decides accordingly. There is therefore a contrast drawn in the body

of section 75 between an agreement as to the amount of the assessable

income and the determination of the assessable income on appeal.

Therefore, it appears that there was a practice of the Commissioner of Income

Tax directing the assessor to reconsider and the assessee can make

representations to the assessor. If they can arrive at an adjustment that will

expedite the process of recovering the tax. As per Justice Victor Pereras

judgment too, if reasons are given before sending the notice of assessment, the

tax payer has an opportunity of fully enlightening the assessor. However as the

learned Chief Justice refuted this position, as at today there is no compulsory

requirement to send reasons prior to the notice of assessment. However the

30 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

question in the present case is not as to when reasons has to be given, but as to

whether an assessment becomes a valid one only when notice of assessment is

given. Hence what was said in this passage was said in orbiter.

Hence it is clear that giving reasons (letters of intimation as they are sometimes

referred to in arguments) is ideally before making an assessment. Hence further

there is no assessment at the time of giving reasons, unless, as opined by the

learned Chief Justice, reasons accompany the statutory notice. As per section

163(5) the time bar has to be counted from the assessment. This is a valid

assessment, not an estimate. Therefore it cannot be the letter giving reasons

or a letter of intimation, because there cannot exist an assessment at the stage

of the said letter. The assessment comes later after the taxpayer, is given the

statutory notice of assessment.

The same principal adopted in Ismail vs. Commissioner of Income Tax and

D.M.S. Fernando vs. Mohideen Ismail, that assessment becomes valid only

when statutory notice of assessment is given, was followed in the Indian Case

of The Secretary of State for India in Council vs. Seth Khemchand Thaoomal

and others, 1923 decided in the Court of the Judicial Commissioner, Sind,

Reports of Income Tax cases, Vol. I (1886-1925) printed at the Madras Law

Journal press, Maylapore, Madras, 1926. (A copy of the said judgment is

attached to the present judgment)

The summary of the case said,

Where the notice of demand in respect of an assessment to super tax

for the year 1918-1919 was served on the assessee in May 1919 after the

expiry of the year charged for and the assessee instituted a suit to recover

the tax collected from him on the ground that the assessment was illegal:

Held, that there was no charge, recovery or payment of super tax within

the year of assessment as laid down by section 03 of the Super tax Act and

31 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

consequently there being no assessment under the Act, section 39 of the

Income Tax Act was no bar to the suit. (page 26)

The words notice of demand and there was no charge must be noted.

This shows that only when there is a notice, that there is a demand and

a charge. This is the ingredient that gives life to an assessment,

distinguishing it from a mere estimate, which has no such life.

Except for the name super tax in the said kind of tax involved, there is no

difference in the principal applicable.

The court said,

The main point for consideration is whether the assessment of super

tax was an assessment under the Act, for it is only in that event the

jurisdiction of the civil court is barred..(page 27)

As observed in Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 04th Edition

page 429 : Statutes which impose pecuniary burden are subject to the rule

of strict construction. It is a well settled rule of law that all charges upon

the subject must be imposed by clear and unambiguous language,

because in some degree they operate as penalties..(page 27)

Section 06 of Act VIII of 1917 provided that when in the collectors opinion

a person is chargeable with super tax a notice shall be served upon him

calling upon him to pay the amount specified therein or to apply to have

the assessment reduced or cancelled. The only way that an assessee

could be said to be charged is by a demand notice issued by the

income tax officials, for till then it cannot be argued that he has been

charged with the payment of any tax. But the respondents admittedly

received notice of demand only in May 1919, that is after the year 1918-

1919 was over and even if he was chargeable with super tax he ceased to

be so after the expiry of the year. The demand notice, therefore, having

32 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

been issued after the year was over, there was neither payment nor

recovery of the super tax within the year 1918-1919. (page 27)

The lucidity in the aforequoted passage is characteristic of the age in which it

was written. The tax payer could have instituted a suit and recovered the

tax paid because there was no assessment. There was no assessment

because there was no notice, a demand, a charge, within the limited period. This

shows that an assessment becomes a valid assessment only when notice of

assessment is given. For the application of the time limit what must be there

is a valid assessment. Such an assessment cannot come into being without

there being notice of assessment.

The court further said,

Mr. Elphinston [who appeared for the state] attempted to invoke the aid

of a confidential note dated the 23rd March 1919 wherein the Mukhtiarkar

had made the calculation of the assessment and as this was done before

the expiry of the year, he argued that the tax was charged within the year.

This argument has no substance in it. It is unarguable that the contents

of a confidential document were communicated to the assessee, nor

is it even alleged that the latter was aware before the end of the year

that he was chargeable with any super tax. (page 27)

Similarly, the argument for the respondent in the present case that when the

assessment is made it is an assessment for the purposes of the time limit and

there is no time period within which notice of assessment must be given, cannot

succeed.

The court also said,

Mr. Elphinston pressed upon us the serious prejudice to the Crown, if

section 03 were interpreted literally but in a fiscal statute we must look to

the letter of the law and cannot introduce equitable considerations. (page

27)

33 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

There is a patent error of law in the assessment of the super tax and

therefore, the assessment was not one under the Act ; the suit therefore is

not barred. (page 27)

Hence the court considered the failure to give notice of assessment as a

patent error in the assessment which makes the assessment invalid.

It further shows that when notice of assessment is not given within the time

limit, the tax payer obtains a vested right not to be taxed, the reason why in that

case he was able to successfully sue for tax illegally paid.

The position therefore is that in the present case there is no tax validly imposed

for both the years of assessment in question. Hence question of law No. 02 has

to be answered in favour of the appellant.

Interestingly, another division of this Court in Central Finance Company PLC

vs. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, C. A. Tax 08/2018 dated

19.05.2023 in its paragraphs 36 to 41 has considered the judgments of John

Keels Holdings vs. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, C. A. Tax

26/2013 and ACL Cables vs. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,

C. A. Tax 07/2013 decided by this Bench. In paragraph 38 in C. A. Tax

08/2018, that division reproduces the following passage from page 30 31 of

the ACL Cables case, which was already referred to above too, which is,

The lucidity in the aforequoted passage is characteristic of the age in

which it was written. The tax payer could have instituted a suit and

recovered the tax paid because there was no assessment. There was no

assessment because there was no notice, a demand, a charge, within the

limited period. This shows that an assessment becomes a valid

assessment only when notice of assessment is given. For the

application of the time limit what must be there is a valid assessment.

Such an assessment cannot come into being without there being

notice of assessment. [The highlighting as added in C. A. Tax 08/2018]

34 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

But, in paragraph 61 of that judgment, that division purported to follow Honig

& Others (Administrators of Emmanuel Honig) vs. Sarsfield (H. M. Inspector of

Taxes) and basically, several other cases which followed it. But in Honig, it was

a public register. Unfortunately, the attention of that division does not seem to

have been drawn to the other passage from The Secretary of State for India in

Council vs. Seth Khemchand Thaoomal and others, 1923, which said about

a register which is not a public document,

Mr. Elphinston [who appeared for the state] attempted to invoke the

aid of a confidential note dated the 23rd March 1919 wherein the

Mukhtiarkar had made the calculation of the assessment and as this was

done before the expiry of the year, he argued that the tax was charged

within the year. This argument has no substance in it. It is unarguable

that the contents of a confidential document were communicated to

the assessee, nor is it even alleged that the latter was aware before

the end of the year that he was chargeable with any super tax. (page

27)

The argument is simple. The notice is the demand and the charge without

which there is no valid assessment. In Honig there was a public register, which

is a public notice. In The Secretary of State for India in Council vs. Seth

Khemchand Thaoomal and others, 1923 there was none and in this country

under Act No. 10 of 2006 there was none.

In C. A. Tax 08/2018, the other division of this Court has said at paragraph 49,

In England, the certificate made by the Inspector of Taxes in the

assessment book may fix the Inspector of Taxes to a definite position

that an assessment has been made under the provisions of the Taxes

Management Act. In Sri Lanka, once the assessment made by the

assessor is communicated to the taxpayer in writing (by registered letter

dated 26.11.2012) signed by the assessor with reasons for not accepting

the return, the assessor is fixed to a definite position that an assessment

35 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

had been made, which cannot be changed or chopped thereafter. When

that happens, there is no way for the taxpayer to argue that no assessment

has been made until the notice of assessment is received.

This Court agrees with the first sentence in the above passage in bold print.

That is why the assessment book is a public document. This Court is unable

to agree with the rest of the passage, where reference has been made a letter of

intimation, because of the following reasons,

(01) According to the early case of Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Saverimuttu

Chetty (1937) 39 NLR 01, decided under the first tax statute, Income Tax

Ordinance No. 02 of 1932, Sir Sidney Abrahams Chief Justice said, (as was

quoted above too)

Section 69 of the Ordinance contemplates the following procedure

whereby an assessee who has been wrongly assessed in any respect can

obtain a redress of his grievance. He can file an objection in writing to the

assessment. This done, the Commissioner may direct an assessor to make

further inquiry and the assessor and the assessee may between

themselves settle the matter or, in the language of sub-section (2) to

section 69, make the "necessary adjustment" as a result of their

agreement. If no agreement is reached, the Commissioner hears the appeal

and decides accordingly. There is therefore a contrast drawn in the body

of section 75 between an agreement as to the amount of the assessable

income and the determination of the assessable income on appeal.

(02) Justice Victor Perera, in the Court of Appeal in Ismail vs. Commissioner of

Inland Revenue 1981 said, (as was quoted above too)

The amended section 93, sub-section (2) imposed a duty on the Assessor

who rejected a return furnished by any person to communicate to such

person in writing the reasons for not accepting the return. This section

36 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

clearly dealt with the assessment of income, wealth and gifts, the rejection

of a return and a communication had to be done before the notice of

assessment stating the amount of the assessment of income, wealth and

gifts and the amount of the tax charged is sent under section 95. (page

99).

The learned Chief Justice, who wrote the lead judgment in appeal, in D.

M. S. Fernando vs. Mohideen Ismail, 1982 said, (as was quoted above too)

At this stage it would be convenient to deal with the opinion of Perera J.

that the amending law clearly contemplated that the notice

communicating the reasons for not accepting of a return should be an

exercise before the actual assessment of income, wealth or gifts is made

for the purpose of sending the Statutory Notice of Assessment referred to

in Section 95. I have quoted him verbatim because it appears to me that

he considered this communication to be a condition precedent to making

an estimate of assessable income. Perera J. was of the view that the

intent of the provision was to give the Assessee an opportunity to

meet the Assessor-so as to convince him, if possible, that his non-

acceptance was erroneous.

The learned Chief Justice, however, did not accept the position of Victor Perera

J., that, giving reasons for non acceptance of the return should precede the

statutory notice of assessment. At page 22 of this judgment, having quoted what

Justice Victor Perera said at page 99 100 of Ismail, this Court said,

It is to be noted that Justice Victor Perera uses the term notice

interchangeably to mean notice communicating the reasons and

the notice of assessment sent under section 95, which he sometimes

referred to as statutory notice of assessment.

37 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

Although Justice Victor Perera used the term notice to mean more than one

thing, he was not confused which is which. It must be remembered that Ismails

case was not a Tax appeal arising from a Case Stated but a Writ Application on

the question of giving reasons for a decision. The confusion of communication

of reasons and the notice of assessment was seen in the judgment of W. N. D.

Perera J., in Philip Upali Wijewardene (Appellant) cs. C. Kathiragamer and

another 1992, which was considered in detail in this judgment at page 29 et.

Seq. The following passage from that case shows that, (as was quoted above too)

Communication of reasons for rejecting a return is mandatory and has to

be done at or about the time, an assessment is made on an estimated

income. In the instant case the assessments have been sent to the assessee

at or about the time, the assessments were made. There is therefore

substantial compliance with the requirement of the law.

The first sentence refers to reasons whereas the second sentence refers to the

assessment. There was a serious confusion, hence, that they are not two but

one, which is wrong.

It may not be forgotten, as to how, Justice Victor Perera, being the Third in

seniority on that Divisional Bench of the Court of Appeal, nevertheless writing

the principal judgment commenced by saying,

This application for writ of certiorari and/or prohibition on the

Commissioner of Inland Revenue has raised a very important issue which

affects the Inland Revenue Department and all persons liable to pay

income tax, wealth tax or gifts tax and which requires a careful

consideration of the present administrative procedure and machinery for

the assessment of income, wealth or gifts and the assessment of the tax

chargeable and the collection thereof in the light of the Inland Revenue. It

will therefore be necessary to examine the provisions dealing with income

tax from its inception in this country and the various amendments in the

law from time to time in order to appreciate the need for, the purpose and

38 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

effect of the amendments of the law that became necessary and to consider

whether in that context the amendments embodied in the Law No. 30 of

1978 in some positive way, had altered the administrative procedures and

imposed mandatory duties on assessors in regard to assessments and the

effect of a non-compliance with such procedures and such duties. This is

the question that arises for decision on this application before us.

The salient feature of the long standing practice Justice Victor Perera recognized,

was to give an assessee an opportunity to bring to the notice of the assessor any

matters that would make both of them enter into a compromise, which would

expedite the recovery of income tax without embarking upon a journey that

involves the cost and the delay in litigation. Of course, if they do not agree, the

next alternative was litigation. In refuting Justice Victor Pereras proposition to

the above effect, the learned Chief Justice in D. M. S. Fernando vs. Mohideen

Ismail, 1982, wittingly or unwittingly thought this practice was not essential, as

his lordship said, His reasons must be communicated at or about the time he

sends his assessment But, this does not, it is respectfully submitted, would

elevate a communication of reasons, a letter of intimation to the status of the

statutory notice of assessment. Unless, of course, the same confusion as

Justice W. N. D. Perera, with respect, was made which is the cause for paragraph

49 of C. A. Tax 08/2018.

Also, in regard to the time limit in section 163(5) of Act No. 10 of 2006, the

following is applicable.

It was said in Tara Art Press vs Collector of Customs on 15 April, 1986,

decided in the Customs, Excise and Gold Tribunal Delhi as,

The Rule of construction applicable to a taxing statute was well

expressed in the classic words of Rowlett. J. in the Cape Brandy

Syndicate v. I.R.C. (1971) 2 WLR 39(PC) P.42 as follows:

39 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

"In a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is already said. There

is no room for any intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There

is no presumption as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is

to be implied. One can only look fairly at the language used".

The above passage from the judgement of Rowlett. J. has been

quoted times out of number and approved by the House of

Lords, Privy Council and Supreme Court in a number of cases.

Some of the synonyms for fairly are, neutrally, disinterestedly, by the book,

without bias and with an open mind.

It may be noted, that, Cape Brandy Syndicate case was not decided in 1971,

but in 1921 (50 years before) as it was the time the learned Lord Justice adorned

the Bench of the English Court of Appeal.

Rowlatt J., was not only instrumental in deciding on fiscal statutes, but had Lord

Greene M. R. in mistakenly celebrated Wednesbury case in 1949 given due

prominence to the case of Theatre de Luxe (Halifax) Limited vs. Gledhill, 16th

December 1914, [1915] 2 K. B. 4911, in which Lush J. and Rowlatt J.

excellently analysed the statute and the decision of the local authority, which

purported to prohibit the attendance of children under a certain age at a cinema

after a certain hour, which case was relied upon by the cinema (the appellant) in

11 Instead Lord Greene M. R. said, I do not think I need take up time by referring to other authorities, but I might say this in conclusion. An early case under the Cinematograph Act, 1909, much discussed before us, was Theatre de Luxe (Halifax), Ld. v. Gledhill [1915] 2 KB 49 . That was a decision of a Divisional Court as to the legality or a condition imposed under the Act to the following effect: Children under fourteen years of age shall not be allowed to enter into or be in the licensed premises after the hour of 9 p.m. unaccompanied by a parent or guardian. No child under the age of ten years shall be allowed in the licensed premises under any circumstances after 9 p.m. That case was heard by a Divisional Court of the King's Bench Division, consisting of Lush, Rowlatt and Atkin JJ. The majority, consisting of Lush and Rowlatt JJ. held that the condition was ultra vires as there was no connexion, as the headnote says, between the ground upon which the condition was imposed, namely, regard for the health and welfare of young children generally, and the subject-matter of the licence, namely, the use of the premises for the giving of cinematograph exhibitions. That case is one which, I think, I am right in saying has never been referred to with approval, but often referred to with disapproval, though it has never been expressly overruled.

40 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

Wednesbury case; and more so, had the English judges and lawyers thought of

applying Theatre de Luxe reasonableness instead of Wednesbury

unreasonableness as a yardstick of their Administrative law, the principle of

proportionality, which is regarded today as something started in the continent

and of relatively recent origin could have been an English administrative law

principle originated 108 years ago (i.e., on 16th December 1914)

In Theatre de Luxe (Halifax) Rowlatt J., in the Kings Bench Division said,

The condition accepts the position that children of any age may come in

either accompanied or unaccompanied by grown up people up to 9 oclock,

but after that hour it says that no children shall be there at all under ten

and if over ten and under fourteen the child must be accompanied by its

parent or guardian. It is perfectly obvious that, looking at it apart from

what appears in the case, the authority was addressing itself to a social

question entirely independent of the management of this place as a picture

theatre, a very broad and important question on which one may have

opinions and if the council could enter into it one would not say that the

conclusion to which they had come was unreasonable. If they are the

judges whether children under ten should go to a cinematograph

exhibition after 9 oclock, it would be very difficult to say that the condition

was unreasonable, but it seems to me that under this Act they are not the

judges of that question of public policy.

The case of Wednesbury itself was a cinematograph case, where the question

was whether the Associated Provincial Picture Houses, Limited, could admit

children under 15 years to Gaumont cinema on Sundays, accompanied by their

parents or not and whatever the nature of the film. Although Sunday

Entertainments Act of 1932, which replaced the Sunday Observance Act 1781

(21 Geo. 3, c.49) imposed restrictions, had Lord Greene M. R. considered the

principle laid down by Rowlatt J., that, but it seems to me that under this Act

they are not the judges of that question of public policy, his lordship would not

41 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

have based his decision on the premise, "Nobody, at this time of day, could say

that the well-being and the physical and moral health of children is not a matter

which a local authority, in exercising their powers, can properly have in mind

when those questions are germane to what they have to consider", which could

not be taken into account, on Lord Greenes own decision, that, He must exclude

from his consideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has to consider.

What is relevant is what the statute says and if the court traverses outside that

limit, it treads into the area of public policy making, which is a question for the

legislature, not the judiciary; and more so, in a fiscal statute, as Rowlatt J., very

correctly said in Cape Brandy Syndicate. Having missed the opportunity of

following Rowlatt J., in Theatre de Luxe (Halifax) case, in which he clearly

identified the difference between an authority exercising the power

conferred upon it by the legislature and traverses into the sphere of public

policy, what the learned Lord justice said in Cape Brandy Syndicate, which

unlike his dictum in the other case had a better fate of being followed by

the House of Lords, the Privy Council, the Supreme Court of India and some

courts of this country must be preserved.

Question No. 05: Whether the phrase industrial and machine tool

manufacturing inter alia appearing in section 17 of the Inland Revenue Act

No.10 of 2006 can be interpreted as industrial manufacturing and machine tool

manufacturing ?

In regard to this question, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant has

argued in oral submissions12 that, an industrial tool does not mean only a

screwdriver or a wrench, etc., but it includes cables.

12 In C. A. Tax 09/2013

42 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

The learned Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the respondent has

argued in her oral submissions that the aforesaid position of the appellant

regarding an industrial tool, is not what is in the case stated.

This appears to be correct because question of law No. 05 attempts to interpret

the phrase industrial and machine tool manufacturing as industrial

manufacturing and machine tool manufacturing.

The plain reading of the phrase shows that it means, industrial tool

manufacturing and machine tool manufacturing.

Section 17 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 reads thus,

17(1) The profits and income within the meaning of paragraph (1) of

section 3 (other than any profits and income from the sale of capital assets)

of any company from any specified undertaking referred to in subsection

(2) and carried on by such company after 01st April 2002, shall be exempt

from income tax for a period of five years reckoned from the

commencement of the year of assessment in which the undertaking

commences to make profits or any year of assessment not later than two

years reckoned from the date on which the undertaking commences to

carry on commercial operations whichever is earlier.

(2) For the purpose of sub section (1) specified undertaking means

(a) An undertaking carried on by a company-

(i)incorporated before 01st April 2002, with a minimum

investment of rupees fifty million invested in such

undertaking; or

43 | C . A . T a x 1 9 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 3 0 t h N o v e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

(ii) incorporated with a minimum investment of rupees ten

million invested in such undertaking,

and which is engaged in agriculture, agro processing, industrial

and machine tool manufacturing, machinery manufacturing,

electronics, export of non traditional products, or information technology

and allied services.

Even the Tax Appeal Commission has decided this question in the same way. It

says at page 06 of its determination,

It is to be noted that in section 17(2)(a)(ii) even though some terms such

as agriculture, agro processing, non traditional products and

deemed export are defined, the phrase industrial and machine tool

manufacturing is not defined. Therefore it is necessary to look for a

meaning to be attributed to this phrase industrial and machine tool

manufacturing. It would appear that in the phrase industrial and

machine tool manufacturing the main item referred to is the term tool

and the words tool manufacturing are qualified by the words industrial

and machine. Therefore in this phrase industrial and machine tool

manufacturing the term tool can be understood to mean either an

industrial tool or a machine tool.

But having correctly understood the question, the Tax Appeal Commission erred

in looking at the meaning of the term tool in dictionaries whereas it should

have considered the meaning of the phrase industrial tool manufacturing.

It considered the meaning of the term tool in the Oxford Dictionary, which it

gave as an instrument such as a hammer, screw driver, saw, etc., that you hold

in your hand and use for making things, repairing things, etc. garden tools,

cutting tools or power tools (using electricity).

Hence it concluded at page 07 of its determination,

However, PVC Compound, as submitted by the Representative for the

Appellant is, used as a raw material in producing wire and cables,

aluminium beadings, three wheeler beading and furniture beading etc.

Once the PVC Compound is used, it becomes a permanent fixure and will

not be available for repeated use, as in the case of a hammer, a saw, or a

screw driver etc.

But this would not have happened had the Tax Appeal Commission considered

the meaning of the phrase industrial tool manufacturing, which shows that

PVC Compound are such tools. All tools, especially industrial tools need

not be hand held tools in the popular meaning, as the Tax Appeal

Commission said. Furthermore, the test that a tool must be able to be

used on more than one occasion is not always true, especially in regard to

an industrial tool.

The Tax Appeal Commission said, In this regard, it is a very useful rule in the

interpretation of a statute, to adhere to the ordinary meaning of the word used

and to the grammatical construction, unless that is at variance with the

intention of the legislature, to be derived from the statute itself.

Here using the word in its ordinary meaning was in variance with the intention

of the legislature, which was to be derived from the statute itself, because the

term used was not tool as the Tax Appeal Commission thought but industrial

tool manufacturing.

The use of the prefix industrial before the term tool manufacturing

alters its ordinary meaning.

Therefore it is clear that the appellant is entitled to the exemption from tax

because it is engaged in industrial tool manufacturing which is a specified

undertaking.

However, the question of law No. 05 is not correctly formulated, in the sense, it

should have referred not to industrial manufacturing, but to industrial tool

manufacturing. Hence while the said question of law has to be answered in the

negative, the answer must accompany with an explanation that the term

industrial and machine tool manufacturing can be interpreted as industrial

tool manufacturing and machine tool manufacturing, in which the appellants

product comes within the former.

Question No. 06: Whether the investment requirement under section 17 of the

Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 need to be effected/infused on the date of

incorporation of a company to become eligible for the exemption?

Section 17 of Act No. 10 of 2006 reads,

17. (1) The profits and income within the meaning of paragraph (a) of

section 3 (other than any profits and income from the sale of capital assets)

of any company from any specified undertaking referred to in subsection

(2), and carried on by such company on or after April 1, 2006, shall be

exempt from income tax for a period of five years reckoned from the

commencement of the year of assessment in which the undertaking

commences to make profits from transactions entered into in that year of

assessment or from the commencement of the year of assessment

immediately succeeding the year of assessment in which the undertaking

completes a period of two years reckoned from the date on which the

undertaking commences to carry on commercial operations, whichever

occurs earlier:

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) specified undertaking means (a)

an undertaking carried on by a company (i) incorporated before April 1,

2002, with a minimum investment of rupees fifty million invested in such

undertaking ; or (ii) incorporated on or after April 1, 2002, but prior to

April 1, 2011, with a minimum investment of rupees ten million invested

not later than March 31, 2012, in such undertaking,

and which is engaged in agriculture, agro processing, industrial and

machine tool manufacturing, machinery manufacturing, electronics,

export of non-traditional products, or information technology and allied

services;

What was said by the Supreme Court in Vallibel Lanka (Pvt) Limited vs. Director

General of Customs as,

It is an established rule in the interpretation of statutes levying taxes and

duties, not to extend the provisions of the statute by implication, beyond the

clear import of the language used or to enlarge their operation in order to

embrace matters not specifically pointed out

and

In case of doubt, the provisions are construed most strongly against the state

and in favour of the citizen,

is applicable.

Therefore, this Court answers the Questions of Law, except Question No. 01

which this Court said answering has become superfluous in favour of the

Appellant. In regard to Question No. 05 the answer given for Question No. 03 in

07 2013 and Question No. 04 in 09 2013 would apply since the formulation of

that Question was altered.

Hence the appeal in the form of a Case Stated is allowed.
