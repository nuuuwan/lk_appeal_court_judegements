COUNSEL : P. K. Prince Perera with S. Panchadsaram

for the Petitioner.

R. Aluwihare SC, for the Respondents.

ARGUED ON : 10.05.2023

DECIDED ON : 08.06.2023

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. The petitioner in this application was a Reserve Police Constable

attached to the Department of Police. While he was serving in the Matale

Police station, his services were suspended by letter P-2 dated

20.06.2000 (P-2). The respondents submitted that the petitioner was

suspended from service for preparing fraudulent documents for the

settlement of certain persons within the Mathale Police District (R-1).

Thereafter, the petitioner has requested from the Minister of

Parliament, Mr. Rauf Hakeem that the suspension be lifted. However,

the petitioner was informed that his request could not be granted (R-2).

Subsequently, by letter dated 01.02.2011, marked R-3, the petitioner

was informed that there was no possibility of reinstating the petitioner

in service and that his services would be terminated permanently. It is

specifically stated in the said letter that due to the gravity of the charges

leveled against him, as well as the fact that the reserve police force had

been abolished on 01.02.2006, the petitioner could not be reinstated to

the service. In response, the petitioner preferred an appeal to the Public

Service Commission. After considering the appeal, the Public Service

Commission dismissed the appeal and informed the petitioner of its

decision by letter dated 10.04.2015, marked R-4.

The petitioner was served with a charge sheet dated 09.02.2016

containing three charges, and consequently, a disciplinary inquiry was

conducted. The petitioner stated that the inquiry was concluded on

19.11.2016, but no order has been issued against him.

The acting Inspector General of Police informed the petitioner by the

letter dated 19.03.2014, marked R-5 (The date mentioned in the letter,

as seen in R-5, is 2014.03.19, but the signature was placed in

2013.12.16, prior to the date of the letter) that his services were

terminated and his name was struck off from the officers registry.

Six years after the said termination, the petitioner filed the instant

application on 7th July 2020 seeking a writ of mandamus against the

1st to 3rd respondents directing them to issue the petitioners

disciplinary order. If the petitioner is acquitted of the charges, the

petitioner sought a writ of mandamus against the 1st to 3rd respondents

directing them to mobilize the petitioner in the post of Reserve Police

Constable with effect from 20.06.2000, absorb the petitioner into the

post of Regular Police Constable and pay all his salaries and

entitlements from 20.06.2000.

At the hearing of the application, the learned Counsel for the petitioner

and the learned State Counsel for the respondents made oral

submissions.

The main contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner was that

since a disciplinary inquiry was held against the petitioner, an order

should be delivered and the petitioner is entitled to obtain the said

order. The learned Counsel contended further that in terms of Section

22.4 of Chapter 48, Volume II of the Establishment Code, the

disciplinary order should be issued immediately after the conclusion of

the inquiry and the 1st to 3rd respondents had breached the legal and

public duty by not issuing the disciplinary order.

The learned State Counsel appeared for the respondents contended that

the orders contained in R-4 and R-7 should be quashed to grant the

relief of reinstatement prayed for by the petitioner, but according to

Article 61A of the Constitution, this court has no jurisdiction to quash

an order made by the Public Service Commission. In addition, the

learned State Counsel contended that the petitioner has suppressed

material facts by not disclosing the letter R-5, wherein it is clearly

mentioned the reason for terminating his service.

Apart from the aforesaid two contentions, the learned State Counsel

advanced a straightforward argument as to why the reliefs prayed for

by the petitioner could not be granted. His argument was that when the

petitioners service was terminated by letter R-5 in 2014, without

making an application to quash the said order of termination, the

petitioner could not maintain this application for writs seeking

reinstatement and a direction to issue the disciplinary order.

Furthermore, the learned State Counsel contended that a disciplinary

inquiry had been held against the petitioner inadvertently; however, an

inquiry is not required to terminate the service of a reserve police officer.

In determining this application, I am of the view that it is not necessary

to consider whether holding a disciplinary inquiry against the petitioner

is required by law. It is precisely clear that the petitioner was informed

by letter R-5 that his service is terminated and his name is struck off

from the officers registry. As per letter R-6, it is also clear that the

petitioner was well aware of the termination of his service although the

contents of R-5 have not been disclosed by the petitioner as pointed out

by the learned State Counsel.

Apart from preferring an appeal to the Public Service Commission, the

petitioner had not instituted any legal proceedings to quash the order

of termination of service. The said order has not been challenged by the

petitioner. The disciplinary inquiry has been commenced on

Page 5 of 5

09.05.2016. That means the disciplinary inquiry was commenced after

two years of the termination of his service. Therefore, it is clear that the

provisions of the Establishment Code do not apply to a person who is

not in public service. In addition, there is no purpose in holding an

inquiry against a person whose services have already been terminated

because whatever the outcome of the inquiry, his services have already

been terminated. In the circumstances, the petitioner is not entitled to

get the disciplinary order. What was informed by letter R-7 by the Public

Service Commission is also the same. At the same time, it is to be noted

that the reason for terminating the service of the petitioner has been

informed to him by the unchallenged decision contained in R-5.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the reliefs prayed for in the

petition cannot be granted. Accordingly, the application for writs is

dismissed. No costs.
