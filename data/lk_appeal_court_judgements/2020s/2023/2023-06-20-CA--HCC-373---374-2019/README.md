MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeals have been lodged to set aside the judgment dated 18.12.2019 of

the High Court of Panadura.

In the High Court four accused along with the deceased accused have been indicted

under sections 140,146/296 and in the alternative 32/296 under the Penal Code. All

four accused have pleaded not guilty and trial had proceeded and upon the conclusion

of the trial, the judge had acquitted all four accused on count no 3 and had convicted

the second and the fourth accused under counts 1 and 2 and had sentenced both to

death.

Hence second and the fourth accused being aggrieved by the said judgment had filed

the instant appeals. The main ground of appeal is that if the learned trial judge had

acquitted the four accused under section 32 of the penal code there is no evidence of

a formation of an unlawful assembly since the first and the third had been acquitted

and the charges reads, as the four accused along with the deceased accused and not

accused unknown to the prosecution were members of an unlawful assembly. Hence

the Counsel for the two appellants strenuously argued that there is no formation of an

unlawful assembly at any given point of the prosecution case because there was no

participation of five or more accused in the offence committed.

The version of the prosecution is mainly narrated by witness no 1 who had been

known to the deceased and the 1st accused and on the day of the incident the

deceased pw1 and the 1st accused had gone to have a drink at the restaurant in town

in the morning and when they went there, there had been a three wheeler parked and

another and about six or seven people had been inside the restaurant eating and

drinking. The deceased the 1st accused and witness no 3 and 2 had been talking in the

kitchen in the restaurant when the second accused had come from inside the

Page 4 of 10

restaurant in to the kitchen and on seeing the deceased had spoken very well to the

deceased and had said that the old enmities are well forgotten and had held the hand

of the deceased and both of them had gone in to the restaurant and the deceased had

locked the door between the kitchen and the restaurant, according to the evidence of

pw1 at page 78.

Thereafter the deceased pw 2, 3, and the 1st accused had remained in the kitchen area

when the fourth accused had come from outside in to the kitchen shouting in

unwarranted language pointing the gun at pw1 and questioning him as to who

brought the Kerio.

Thereafter there had been noise form inside the restaurant and somebody had

shouted demanding the door to be opened but no one had identified the said voice. At

that point the fourth accused had shot and kicked the door opened and had gone in to

the restaurant. Thereafter pw2,3, 1A had runoff and pw1 had remained and he had

seen the fourth accused also going away from the house and then he had gone inside

to find the deceased fallen injured in the front verandah of the restaurant.(the police

observations also support this version)

The police had recovered a firearm on the statement of the fourth accused and a

bullet from the scene, the deceased had died of firearm injuries but had sustained 12

injuries in the nature of firearm and contusions.

Upon perusing the judgment of the trial judge, we find that he had started off the

judgment at page 483 on the premise that on a preplanned arrangement at a

restaurant the deceased had been killed by a drunkard party.

But according to the prosecution evidence this Court sees no preplanning of the four

accused along with the deceased accused, in fact we see no evidence of the two

accused convicted along with the deceased accused meeting and being at the same

Page 5 of 10

place at the same time. Therefore, we find that the trial judge had started off the

adjudication on a wrong premise.

We also found that the trial judge had narrated the evidence of the prosecution and

had narrated the principles of circumstantial evidence but had failed to apply the same

to the evidence of the prosecution and itemize the relevant portions to say as to what

circumstances completed the strands in the rope of circumstantial evidence as said in

many of our decided cases which had used the principle of circumstantial evidence to

find the accused guilty.

The liability attached to the second accused by the trial judge is the fact that the

second accused held the hand of the deceased and took him in to the restaurant

before the shooting, but there is no evidence from the prosecution to say that the

second and the fourth were acting in furtherance of a common object or common

intention. There is in fact no evidence to say at least that the second and the fourth

and the deceased accused had met before or had spoken before or had come to the

scene of crime together or at least were known to each other. The evidence of the

prosecution is that the deceased had locked the door after entering into the restaurant

with the deceased and then the shooting took place.

The evidence of the prosecution is that the fourth accused shot at the door and after

the said shooting there had been no other shooting and also the fourth accused had

not been in the kitchen when the second accused had gone in to the restaurant with

the deceased.

But we find that the trial judge had concluded that the second and the fourth accused

had actively participated in the incident which we find to be wrong (506) and in fact

the activity of a dangerous nature had been only from the fourth accused but he too

could not have known that the deceased was on the other side of the door when he

Page 6 of 10

shot at it. According to the prosecution version the fourth accused had shot at the door

when somebody had shouted requesting the door to be open and there had been

several other people on that side of the restaurant. Therefore, we are unable to agree

with the findings of the trial judge on the second accused.

The learned trial judge had referred to the evidence of the doctor at page 507 in the

judgment and had concluded that he had sustained 12 injuries consisting of contusions

and firearm and had concluded that the deceased had been subjected to a scuffle

inside the restaurant, but at another point he had said that the deceased had

sustained cut injuries but there is no evidence to say that either of the accused

convicted had a knife or any other person to that effect.

Anyway, upon taking in to account the analysis of the medical evidence we find that

the trial judge had erroneously drawn conclusions sans evidence from the prosecution.

The trial judge had referred to the bullet recovered from the scene of crime to be

expelled from the firearm of the fourth accused when in fact there had been no such

evidence from the prosecution. (513)

The evidence of the prosecution is that pw1 had identified the second and the fourth at

the ID parade but the witness had very clearly said that the accused were shown to him

at the police station prior to the parade which is against the basic principles of an ID

parade. But this piece of evidence also the trial judge had considered against the

accused.

We also observe that the trial judge had erroneously attached an unnecessary liability

in considering the dock statements by the accused in saying that the dock statements

of the accused must create a reasonable doubt in the case for the prosecution. It has

been held in the case of B.A.Premaratne vs the Republic of Sri Lanka CA168/2009 by

Page 7 of 10

Sisira Abrew J that when considering a dock statement, the following should be

applied,

1)it should be considered subject to the infirmities that it is not a sworn statement,

2)if it is believed it should be accepted upon,

3)if it creates a reasonable doubt the defense of the accused must succeed,

4)dock statement of one must not be used against the other.

On perusal of the above case, it is very clear that the creating a reasonable doubt is

not mandatory for the accused, what the case has held is IF it creates a reasonable

doubt the defense MUST succeed.

Hence in the assessment of the defense case we find that he has cast an unnecessary

burden on the defense at page 517.

Therefore, in the light of the above we find that the trial judge concluded contrary to

the evidence led at the trial.

As with regard to the basis on which the accused had been convicted at page 521 in

the judgment appears to be on the basis of an unlawful assembly which invariable has

to have the participation of minimum of five accused and not less.

In sections 138 and 139 of the Penal Code an unlawful assembly has been defined and

it reads as follows,

138. An assembly of five or more persons is designated an unlawful assembly if the

common object of the persons composing that assembly is.

Page 8 of 10

139. Whoever, being aware of facts which render any assembly an unlawful assembly,

intentionally joins that assembly, or continues in it, is said to be member of an unlawful

assembly. .

The aforesaid sections have been well defined in the case of Jayasena & Others v.

G.D.D. Perera, Inspector, Criminal Investigation Department and Mrs. Sirimavo

Bandaranayake (Aggrieved Party), [1992] SRI L.R. 371. CA.

The mere presence of a person in an assembly does not render him a member of an

unlawful assembly, unless it is shown that he said or did something or omitted to do

something which would make him a member of such unlawful assembly. The

prosecution must place evidence pointing to each accused having done or said

something from which the inference could be drawn that each entertained the object

which is said to be the common object of such assembly. Omnibus evidence must be

carefully scrutinized to eliminate all chances of false or mistaken implication as the

possibility of persons in an assembly resenting or condemning the activities of

misguided persons cannot be ruled out and caution has to be exercised in deciding

which of the persons present can be safely described as members of the unlawful

assembly. Although as a matter of law and overt act is not a necessary factor

bearing upon membership of an unlawful assembly, yet, it is safer to look for some

evidence of participation by each person alleged to be a member before holding that

such person is a member of the unlawful assembly, lest innocent persons be

punished for no of theirs. The common object of an assembly is an inference from

facts to be deducted from the facts and circumstances of each case. The common

object can be collected from the nature of the assembly, the arms used by them, the

behavior of the assembly, at or before the scene of occurrence, and subsequent

conduct. The common object must be readily deducible from the direct as well as

circumstantial evidence, including the conduct of the parties. It is not sufficient for

Page 9 of 10

such evidence to be consistent with such an inference. But must be the only

conclusion possible. Merely because the specific offence with which the unlawful

assembly is charged is not proved. It does not mean that the common object of the

unlawful assembly should be held to be non-existent. In order, to find the common

object of an unlawful assembly at the beginning, it is not a legitimate method merely

to take all the actual offence committed by it in the course of the riot and to infer

that all these were originally party of its common object. The conclusion must

normally be based on more evidence than the mere acts themselves.

In the instant matter according to page 522 of the brief the finding and the sentencing

of the trial judge is not at all justifiable because nowhere in the evidence is it shown

that there were five accused who had shared a common object and out of the accused

found guilty even along with the deceased accused the numerical number of the

assembly is only three and all accused have been acquitted on the charge based on

common intention.

Therefore, we find the conviction and sentencing of the trial judge to be highly

unreasonable and erroneous.

At this stage learned Counsel appearing for the respondents strenuously urged that

Court may consider the case under section 436 of Code of Criminal Procedure but we

are unable to do so because if so, the learned Attorney General should have taken

action to file papers at the time of conviction and not wait until the accused appellants

have done so.

As such the instant appeals by the numbers 373 and 374 of 2019 are hereby allowed

and we set aside the convictions and the sentences of both the appellants entered by

the trial judge.
