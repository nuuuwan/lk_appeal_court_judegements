punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code read together with Section 32

Count 5- Offence of Causing Grievous Hurt to Nithyanantha Kurukkal

Jehanantha Sarma punishable under Section 317 of the Penal Code read

together with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

Prosecution led evidence of seventeen witnesses PW1 to PW17 and closed its case

wherein marked productions from P1 to P12. The Accused gave evidence from the

evidence box. At the conclusion of the trial, The Learned High Court Judge convicted all

three Accused guilty on all five counts, and the death sentence was imposed.

The following grounds were set out in the written submission as grounds for appeal.

1. Evidence of eye witness who witnessed the killing of the deceased are

untrustworthy

2. Failure of the trial judge to consider doubts regarding number of bullets which

have been fired.

3. Failure to consider the unseen hand (possibly a police touch) behind the

investigation and even the trial in the High Court

4. How during the trial common intention of the 1st and 2nd accused has been proved

beyond reasonable doubt

5. The Learned High Court Judge has been misguided by the narrated story made up

by the hidden hand (Army and Police touch)

The facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that:

The younger son of the deceased, Nithyantha Kurukkal Jehanantha Sarma (known

as PW1 in court proceedings), who was an eyewitness and also sustained injuries on the

unfortunate day of December 11, 2010, provides significant evidence. He narrates that he

was accosted by three individuals who menacingly warned him against shouting,

Page 4 of 13

threatening to shoot him if he did. Despite this, he yelled, "Appa, Appa," attracting his

father's attention. Upon his father's arrival, the men immediately shot him.

Subsequently, they targeted PW1, causing him to sustain two to three chest injuries. In

his desperate attempt to escape the line of fire, he fled, vaulting over the parapet wall to

his elder brother's (identified as PW4 in the case) residence for sanctuary. Once safe, he

contacted his friends and instructed them to alert the police.

Subsequently, PW1 climbed the water tank, and due to the adequate light provided

by a nearby lamppost, he observed the 2nd and 3rd Accused fleeing the scene on a

motorcycle. At that moment, only the 2nd and 3rd Accused were recognizable as they had

removed the cloth covering their eyes. It is interesting to note that he alleged that he

identified the 3rd Accused as the shooter who targeted both him and his father, and the

2nd Accused who stood there even though both the Accused were wearing the cloth.

In the cross-examination conducted on the same day, he stated that he couldn't

describe the appearance of the 2nd and 3rd Accused as they were clad in raincoats (black

jackets). However, he provided descriptions of their physical appearance during the

identification parade. Furthermore, when giving evidence, he reaffirmed this

identification.

We note that during cross-examination, PW1 mentioned he was hiding in the

bathroom of PW4's house, located at the rear, and from there, he saw the Accused (1st and

2nd) remove their masks before departing on the motorcycle. Given the adequate lighting,

he was able to identify the features of the 2nd and 3rd Accused, even if he couldn't see

their faces clearly.

The Counsel for the Accused brought to notice that this item of evidence was not

stated by this witness when he made a statement to the Police. At the Trial, this was

brought to notice as an Omission. But the Learned High Court Judge had not considered

this omission. One of the allegations made by the Counsel was that only after the Police

recovered the cloth which was found at the crime scene this piece of evidence was

introduced to the witness.

When we consider the above said evidence of PW1, we are of the view that there

has been an omission brought up which has not been taken into consideration by the

Learned Trial Judge. The lack of consistency, in this witness statement is questionable.

Page 5 of 13

Upon scrutinizing PW1's cross-examination and identifying inconsistencies and

discrepancies with his original witness statement, it is clear that his evidence is not

consistent. For instance, he claims to have witnessed the incident from the bathroom of

PW4's house during his cross-examination, yet in his original statement, he states he

observed the scene from atop the water tank. Analyzing his testimony in conjunction with

PW4's, it's clear that the incident occurring in front of PW4's house couldn't be seen from

the house's rear. This casts doubt on the credibility of PW1's statement in regards to

identifying the Accused.

This testimony contradicts his initial version, in which he stated that the assailants

covered their faces while shooting, and only removed their coverings when escaping.

Furthermore, it's unclear how he identified the 3rd Accused as the one who shot at him

and his father if it is to be believed that their faces were covered at the time of the

shooting.

According to the second son of the deceased, Nithyantha Kurukkal Sivanantha

Sarma (known as PW4), who also sustained injuries, he heard a distressing noise from

his father's house and therefore he rushed to his fathers aid. He was shot in the leg and

hand near Thulsai Maadam, shortly after which his jewellery was stolen by the Accused.

He was subsequently taken to the hospital. He could identify his assailant as they hadn't

covered their face. He stated that he did not participate in the identification parade, yet

PW6, the Magistrate, recorded that he had participated but didn't identify anyone.

When we juxtapose the testimonies of PW1 and PW4, we find discrepancies. One

witness claims he identified the suspects, who were not wearing masks, but failed to do

so during the identification parade. Meanwhile, PW1, who did identify the suspects during

the parade, had stated that their faces were masked during the shooting. The court thus

concludes that the witnesses contradict each other on this crucial point.

Our central concern is whether PW1 accurately identified the 2nd and 3rd Accused.

We understand the utmost importance of precise identification in a criminal trial, given

the potential severity of the penalties, which can significantly limit an individual's

freedom.

In the recent judgment of Dassanayake Lekamlage Somapala alias Gangabada Sudu

and others v. Attorney General, CA 208-210/2011 decided on 02.09.2014, his Lordship

Anil Goonarathne J. echoed our concern:

Page 6 of 13

A very important aspect of a criminal trial is that the perpetrators of the crime

need to be identified with certainty. Absence of identity of accused would be fatal to the

prosecution case. The learned High Court Judge has merely referred to the items of

evidence of the declaration (P5) but has not considered its probative value.

It is pertinent to note that in the witness statements given PW1 and PW2, they

had identified the Accused involved, however this raises doubt as to whether they had

actually identified the said Accused. PW1 states that he identified the 2nd and 3rd Accused

however did not see their faces because they were wearing black coats, but on the other

hand, he had identified that the 3rd Accused had fired the gun and that the 2nd Accused

was present alongside the gunman. He further contradicted himself stating that he had

originally identified them from the top of the water tank. Later he states that he had

identified them from the bathroom. Further, he stated that he had identified them while

they were leaving on the motorcycle.

Our courts have considered how to accept the visual identification in criminal cases.

In the case of Pallawa Lekamlage Gayan Sanjeewa alias Asanka wellawela and 2

Others v. Attorney General. CA 246/2009, decided On 01.09.2015, Vijith K. Malalgoda

PC.J (P/CA) held that;

In the land mark case on identification Regina V. Turnbull and another 1977 (1)

QB 224 at 228 the question of visual identification in Criminal cases was discussed as

follows; ............. Secondly the judge should direct the jury to examine closely the

circumstances in which the identification by each witness came to be made. How long did

the witness have the accused under observation? At what distance? In what light? Was

the observation impeded in anyway, as for example by passing traffic or a press of people?

Had the witness ever seen the accused before? How often? If only occasionally, had he any

special reason for remembering the accused ......... .

Also in the case of Opatha Widanapathiranege Wasantha and 3 Others v.

Attorney General, CA 179/2006, decided on 29.04.2010, (2010. V. II Unreported), W.L.

Ranjith Silva, J, held that

The Learned Trial Judge ought to have followed the standard guidelines with

regard to his directions to the jury. On the issue of identification evidence the judges must

give accurate directions regarding the identification evidence and direct the jury that they

Page 7 of 13

must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused were correctly identified and

give the benefit of any doubt to the accused. The Jury must be directed as to the possibility

of a mistaken identify even by honest witnesses and if they cannot make up their minds

as to whether the witnesses were lying or mistaken the accused must be given the benefit

of the doubt and should be acquitted. The trial judge must direct the jury to examine

closely the circumstances under which the identification came to be made and the means

of identification. The trial judge should direct the jury on the rules laid down in Rex v.

Turnbull.

I am of the view that PW1s evidence with regard to the identification has created

doubt as he wasnt consistent with his evidence.

In the witness testimony of PW2, Nithyantha Kurukkal Nithiyasivathandawa

Sarma (the eldest son of the Deceased), he stated that he heard gunshot sounds and

wailing noises. Upon reaching his fathers house, he found him fallen at the gate. As he

tried to lift his father, he was held at gunpoint, threatened not to attend to his injured

father, and was robbed of his jewellery. Although he claimed to have identified the

Accused due to their unmasked faces and assault, he was not present at the Identification

parade.

In his cross-examination, he stated that he did not witness his father's fall nor the

Accused's threats. Although he claimed to have seen the Accused, he was unable to

identify any of them during the trial.

According to PW7, Chief Inspector of Police Sumithakumara Liyanagama, a person

call Ramanan informed him of the shooting at 20:55. He along with other police officers

arrived at the crime scene around 21:30. Meanwhile, PW1 and PW2's evidence was

recorded at the police station at 22:10.

He stated that he seized a bike bearing no. 55573390 found at the scene of the crime

under custody. From the information he had received on 12.12.2010, at 16:00 he had

arrested the 1st Accused, and later at 17:15 he had arrested the 2nd Accused. According to

him, the 3rd Accused was handed over to his custody on 13.12.2010 by Major Gunaratne.

Based on the statement of the 2nd Accused the jewellery was recovered.

In his cross examination he had stated that there was a crowd at the crime scene,

Page 8 of 13

he also stated that he found the black cloth at the scene. According to him the 1st Accused

was arrested near the Temple however there was a suggestion made by defence that both

the 1st and 2nd Accused were handed over by the Army. And further, they suggested that

no jewellery was found within the possession of the 1st Accused. The 3rd Accused was

handed over to him on 13.12.2010.

He further stated in his cross examination that it was he who had arrested the three

Accused and denies that it was the Army that had handed the 1st and 2nd Accused to his

custody.

Based on the directions given by the 2nd Accused, PR 71/2010 was taken from the

shrine room behind the picture of the deity where it was concealed and additionally had

also seized the 2nd Accused bike from the scene of the crime. It should be noted that

nothing was proved regarding the ownership of the bike. He also stated that the custody

of the 3rd Accused was handed over to him on 13.12.2010 and he was entrusted the rifle

from PW12.

PW5, the Judicial Medical Officer Dr. Sinnaiah Sivaruban, identified two injuries

on the Deceased: one being a circular injury on the right side of the neck, caused by a

bullet entering and exiting from the middle back part of the neck, and the second being

two cut injuries inflicted by a sharp object such as a knife and stated that the bullet wound

could have been inflicted from a short distance. The cause of death was recorded as a

gunshot injury damaging the vertebral column of the neck area, the spinal cord, and

affecting the brain stem.

PW17, former Major Bangala Prabha Ramanayake, testified that upon receiving

information about an army officer's involvement in a Hindu priest's shooting, he searched

the Alaveddy Army camps Guardrooms. Upon suspicion, he took the 3rd Accused into

custody and held him at the Army Headquarters on the same night. After examining the

gun, he entrusted the rifle to PW12 to hand it over to the Manipay Police station.

In his cross-examination, he confirmed that he arrested the 3rd Accused within 2

to 3 hours, after receiving the information and seized his rifle. He said that he personally

handed the 3rd Accused to the Police from the Army camp.

Page 9 of 13

In the evidence of PW3 Ajantha Wimalasuriya testified that he saw the 3rd and 1st

Accused conversing for 10 minutes on the day in question and 3rd Accused had gone along

with the 1st Accused on his motorcycle to a boutique nearby. This was however denied in

his cross examination. Thereafter when the 3rd Accused returned, he was walking up and

down the camp and stalled a motorcycle traveling on the road to get a bottle of Arrack

which he consumed sharing it with PW3 and one Senanayake. Afterward, he said he was

going to get some rest and took his rifle along with him and after a while, he brought his

mattress and went to sleep. After the investigation conducted by PW17 on the same night

in question, PW3 states that it was the CO-Investigation unit that examined their rifles.

In his cross examination he stated that he did not see 3rd Accused give the gun to anyone.

It must be noted that his statement was recorded one year after the incident. No

reason was given for this delay. We are mindful of the Accused's allegation in their

grounds of appeal that there is foul play by the Army. This allegation will be considered

later.

The Accuseds version.

The 1st Accused testified, stating that he and the 2nd Accused were arrested by

the Army on December 11, 2010, for the alleged shooting of the Deceased. He claims they

were assaulted while held at the Uduvil camp before being transferred to the Manipay

police station. PW7 stated that he arrested the 1st Accused, contradicting the 1st

Accused's claim of being first arrested by the army. The 1st Accused maintained that he

was held at the Manipay police station for a month and that no jewellery was seized from

him.

In cross-examination, the 1st Accused stated that he only met the 3rd Accused face-

to-face three or four times while at the Alaveddy camp. Their interactions were limited to

procuring cigarettes and kit cards. Notably, the 3rd Accused spoke only a little Tamil.

The 2nd Accused also testified, echoing the 1st Accused's account of being arrested

by the army and transferred to the Manipay police station. They were reportedly

apprehended after work while on their way to pick up the 2nd Accused's child. He denied

that no jewellery was recovered from them.

The 3rd Accused testified under oath, stating that he was on guard duty on the day

of the incident. He was taken into custody by PW17 and kept at the Chunakam

Headquarters. According to him, he was transferred to the Manipay Police the next day,

Page 10 of 13

where he was held for 20 days and subjected to torture. He affirmed that no jewellery was

seized from him.

He further testified that he lent the rifle to the 1st and 2nd Accused for hunting

pork and that it was returned after 1 hours. He revealed that during this time, Sergeant

Kamal informed him about the shooting incident, but the 1st and 2nd Accused had not

returned the rifle by then.

During cross-examination, he admitted to lending the gun to the 1st and 2nd

Accused. It's crucial to note that when the rifle was returned, it was short three magazines

and three or four bullets. This rifle was seized by PW17. Furthermore, he acknowledged

that no one else witnessed him handing over the rifle only the 1st and 2nd Accused

were aware of it.

Upon scrutinizing the 3rd Accused's statement, we must determine whether it

suggests that the Accused is testifying in a self-exculpatory manner while implicating the

co-accused. From his judgment, it is evident that the Trial Judge failed to emphasize the

testimony given by the 3rd Accused.

We are mindful of the dictum of Chandrachud,CJ in the case of Dudh Nath Pandey

v. State of Uttar Pradesh AIR 1981 page 911, held that; We do not want to attribute

motives to them merely because they were examined by the defence. Defence witnesses

are entitled to equal treatment with those of the prosecution. And, Courts ought to

overcome their traditional, instinctive disbelief in defence witnesses. Quite often, they tell

lies but so do the prosecution witnesses.

In the case of C.A. Sisira Bandula alias Mahathun v. Attorney General. CA

122/2006, decided on 09.10.2014, Gooneratne, J held that:

It is very unfortunate that this court has to observe that the trial Judge has not

considered and given his mind to the defence case properly. If there were contradictions,

it is the duty of the trial Judge to deal with them in the same manner he dealt with the

prosecution case and decide as to whether such infirmities go to the root of the defence

case. The prime duty of the trial Judge is to weigh the evidence correctly and decide

whether the defence case is capable of creating a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case.

Instead he has allowed himself to be influenced by importing his personal knowledge.

However good or bad the witness or whether he has a bad track record should be forgotten

Page 11 of 13

and not the deciding factor. Trial Judge should only concentrate on the evidence before

court.

The point to be considered here is that the Learned Trial Judge had not put any

emphasis on the evidence postulated by the 3rd Accused from the evidence box. Especially

when PW3 provided evidence he admitted the fact that the 1st and 2nd Accused came to

see the 3rd Accused. Where the 3rd Accused indicated in his evidence, he had given the gun

to the 1st Accused. This evidence was not considered by the Learned High Court Judge.

Therefore, there has been a misdirection of the law for not evaluating information that is

indispensable for the instant trial.

We must be mindful that this case is based on circumstantial evidence. Therefore,

we are guided by the well-established principles of law on circumstantial evidence. To

elaborate, these principles have been clearly set out in the following judgments.

In the case of CA 204/2010 Sudu Hakuruge Jamis and 1 Other v. The Attorney

General, decided on 13.11.2013, his Lordship Sisira De Abrew, J held that; Applying the

principles laid down in the above judicial decisions, I hold that in a case of circumstantial

evidence if the Court is going to arrive at a conclusion that the accused is guilty of the

offence, such an inference must be the one and only irresistible and inescapable conclusion

that the accused himself committed the crime. Further I hold that if the proved facts are

not consistent with the guilt of the accused, he must be acquitted.

This was further analysed in the case of H.K.K.Habakkala v. Attorney General CA

Appeal 107/2005, his Lordship Sisira De Abrew, J held that; The case against the

appellant entirely depended on circumstantial evidence. Therefore it is necessary to

consider the principles governing cases of circumstantial evidence. In his judgement

referred the following case of Don Sunny v. AG 1998 2 SLR Page Gunasekara J held that

1. when a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the proved items

of circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point towards

the only inference that the accused committed the offence. On a consideration of

all the evidence the only inference that can be arrived at should be consistent

with the guilt of the accused only.

Page 12 of 13

2. If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence if an inference can be

drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, then one cannot say

that the charges have been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

3. If upon a consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence if the

only inference that can be drawn is that the accused committed the offence then

they can be found guilty.

The prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused had the

opportunity of committing the offence, the accused can be found guilty only and only if the

proved items of circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt and inconsistent

with their innocence.

We are of the view that the Learned High Court Judge did not adequately analyze

the case's evidence and uncritically accepted PW1s testimony, including the late addition

of the part about the cloth found at the scene. It is crucial to note that we have already

expressed doubts about the credibility of PW1. The Trial Judge overlooked this issue,

resulting in serious questions about whether the 2nd and 3rd Accused were actually

identified at the crime scene.

The sole evidence against the 1st Accused was that upon his arrest, some pieces of

jewellery, later identified by witnesses, were allegedly found in his possession. The key

question for us is whether this evidence alone is sufficient for a murder conviction.

According to the evidence presented to us, he was arrested around 16:00 the following

day. However, he denied in his testimony that anything was seized from him and

maintained that his arrest was carried out by the Army. The question that emerges before

us concerns the reason for the Army officers' three-day delay in handing over the 3rd

accused to the police, given their knowledge of the accused's involvement in a shooting.

This situation raises doubts about potential involvement of the Army officers in this

investigation.

I am mindful of the dictum expressed in Jose v Joy 2008 3 KLT 512 on page 515, held

that; The probability of the prosecution case does not depend upon the improbability or

falsity of the defence case. Irrespective of the falsity of improbability of the defence case,

the prosecution has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. What the court has to

consider is whether the prosecution has proved all the ingredients of the offence or not

and not whether the accused has failed to establish his case to come to conclusion whether

Page 13 of 13

prosecution has established its case. This was followed in Jaysenage Janaka v A.G C. A

192/2017 decided on 27.02.19, by A.L Shiran Gonnaratne J

In our view, the case against the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Accused has not been established

beyond reasonable doubt. For the reasons stated above we set aside the conviction and

the death sentences of the 1st,2nd, and 3rd Accused-Appellants and acquit them of the

charge levelled against them. The appeal of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd appellants is allowed.
