JUDGMENT

The Applicant-Respondent-Appellant, who will be called as Appellant, instituted action under case

No.63894 seeking an eviction order against the Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent [hereinafter

referred to as the Respondent) under Section 5 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act

No.7 of 1979 (as amended)

On summons, the Respondent appeared before Court on 16th February 2017 and was given a date

to show cause as to why an order should not be made against the Respondent as prayed by the

Appellant.

Once the Respondent filed his reasons, the case was fixed for argument by way of written

submissions. The order of the learned Magistrate was pronounced on 1st July 2016, ordering to

issue the order prayed by the Appellant.

Aggrieved by that order, the Respondent moved to the High Court of Nuwara Eliya. Once the

objections, counter-objections and written submissions were filed, the learned High Court Judge

pronounced the order on 21st June 2018, setting aside the order of the learned Magistrate.

Aggrieved by the said order, the Appellant invoked the jurisdiction of this Court.

The Appellant argued that the learned High Court Judge had arrived at a decision by being misled

regarding the law. The Appellant initially employed the Respondent, and he was given a house as

a facility for employees. Once his service was terminated, a quit notice was sent.

The Respondents then moved to the Court of Appeal, praying for a writ of certiorari to quash the

quit notice. When the application was unsuccessful, he moved to the Supreme Court, where his

application was refused without granting leave to appeal on 19th June 2015.

After the order of refusal from the Supreme Court was pronounced, the Appellant sought an

eviction order from the Magistrates Court. The only cause the Respondent could have shown was

that he had a valid permit or was in occupation with written authority.

Section 9(1) and (2) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 reads as

follows:

(1) At the such inquiry the person on whom summons under Section 5 has been served shall

not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in the application under Section 5 except

that such person may establish that he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a

valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written

Page 5 of 7

law and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered

invalid.

(2) It shall not be competent to the Magistrates Court to call for any evidence from the

competent authority in support of the application under Section 5.

When the Respondent was called upon to show cause at the Magistrates Court, the Respondent,

among other matters, produced deed No.5638 attested by W.M.U.N.K. Senanayake (N.P.) dated

8th March 2012.

Relying on this Deed, the Respondent argued that they have a more powerful deed than the permit.

The Land Reforms Commission gave the Deed to the Respondent.

The learned Magistrate had discussed the validity of the said Deed and concluded that the Land

Reform Commission had no authority to transfer lands. The High Court Judge came to his

conclusion on the basis that the learned Magistrate held no authority to investigate the title.

The learned High Court Judge had relied on the decision of Senanayaka Vs. Damunupola1. A

perusal of this judgment is clear that it was a case of a boundary dispute and an ancestral property,

not State land.

The question to determine is, does the learned Magistrate has the power to discuss the validity of

the Deed? If it is the title that was an issue, there is no question that the learned Magistrate had no

power.

When the Respondent was called to show cause, as mentioned above, he had only two grounds to

show. He had produced the Deed, which is not a permit. In that event, the learned Magistrate

cannot accept any written document as a valid written authority, and he must be satisfied whether

the produced document is valid.

Discussing the chain of title is different from identifying whether the document is valid. For a deed

to be valid, the person who transfers it must have ownership. Discussing the ownership is not a

venture to discuss the title as in a civil case.

When perusing the learned Magistrates order and submissions, the land in question was owned

by Nuwara Eliya Tea Company .Under the Land Reforms Act, it was acquired by the Land

Reforms Commission. By Gazette No.815/10 dated 21.04.1994, this land was vested in the Sri

Lanka Plantation Corporation. The Sri Lanka Plantations Corporation leased a lease agreement to

Kelani Valley Plantations Limited.

When writing deed No.5038, the Land Reform Commission had alienated the land to State

Plantation Corporation. In such a situation, if the Land Reform Commission wanted the land back,

he should act under Section 27A(4) of the Land Reform Commission Law, whereby steps should

be taken to cancel the order of vesting on the Sri Lanka Plantation Corporation.

The learned Magistrate had considered the legal advice given by the Attorney General to the

Minister in charge, which shows that the Land Reform Commission had no right to confer the land

on the third party in respect of lands vested with the Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation.

Giving thought to the legal advice from the Attorney General, the learned Magistrate concluded

that the Land Reform Commission had executed the Deed when it had no right to do so. Therefore,

the Deed becomes an invalid document which will not come under a valid written authority.

The learned Magistrate had considered the opinion of the Attorney General given to the Minister

in charge of the subject matter. No one can argue that considering the opinion of the Attorney

General, among other things, leads to a study of a chain of titles. When considering the documents

placed before the Magistrate, he had carefully considered and analyzed the documents in his

judgment. He concluded that the Deed was not a valid written document before the law.

We are of the view that the learned High Court Judge had considered the Magistrates order on a

wrong footing. For the reasons discussed above, we set aside the order of the High Court Judge

dated 21st June 2018. We affirm the order of the learned Magistrate dated 1st July 2016.
