Judgment

The Officer in charge of Police Station Balangoda had filed an information 12.05.2012 in terms

of Section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 in the case bearing No. 54771

(Section 66) at the Magistrate Court of Balangoda. It was informed that since there was a dispute

between the 1st and the 2nd Parties in relation to a land, it is likely to result in a breach of the

peace.

The Learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge having inquired the matter

following the procedure stipulated in Part VII of the Primary Court Procedure Act, concluded

the same on 22.09.2015 in favour of the 1st Party Respondent declaring that the 1st Party is

entitled to possession of the disputed land. Further, it was held that the 2nd Party should not

disturb the peaceful possession of the 1st Party to the land in dispute.

Being aggrieved by the said decision of the learned Magistrate, the 2nd Party-Petitioner has

invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Sabaragamuwa Province

holden in Ratnapura in case bearing no R A 43/2015.

After hearing the matter, the Learned Provincial High Court Judge affirmed the order of the

Learned Magistrate and held that the 2nd Party-Petitioner had not established the required

possession and therefore the 1st Party-Respondent is entitled to the possession of the land in

dispute until the matter is resolved by a competent court.

Accordingly, the instant appeal was filed by the 2nd Party-Petitioner-Petitioner (Appellant)

before the Court of Appeal against the said order of the Learned Provincial High Court Judge.

In this regard, the court is cognizant of the decision in Bandulasena and others vs. Galla

Kankanamge Chaminda Kushantha and others CA PHC No. 147/2009 [CA minutes of

27.09.2017], where it was held that,

Page 4 of 7

"It would be relevant to bear in mind that the appeal before this Court is an appeal

against a judgment pronounced by the Provincial High Court in exercising its revisionary

jurisdiction. Thus, the task before this Court is not to consider an appeal against the

Primary Court order but to consider an appeal in which an order pronounced by the

Provincial High Court in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction is sought to be

impugned.

It is also noteworthy that, according to Section 74(2) of the Primary Court Procedure Act, no

Appeal shall lie against any determination under Part VII of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

As such the right given to prefer an appeal to the Court of Appeal against the Order made by

the Provincial High Court exercising revisionary jurisdiction against the order of the Primary

Court made under Section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act is by operation of law.

It was held in the case of Nandawathi and another vs. Mahindasena [(2009) 2 SLR 218],

"When an Order of a Primary Court Judge is challenged by way of revision in the High

Court, the High Court can exercise only question the legality of that Order and not the

correction of that Order".

It was emphasized by Ranjith Silva J. that,

"I am of the opinion that this particular right of appeal in the circumstance: should not

be taken as an appeal in the true sense, but in fact as an application to examine the

correctness, legality or the propriety of the Order made by the High Court Judge in the

exercise of revisionary powers. The Court of Appeal should not under the guise of an

appeal attempt to re-hear or re-evaluate evidence led in the main case".

According to the said dicta by Ranjith Silva J., the Court of Appeal is not supposed to consider

this as an appeal preferred against the Order of the Magistrate's Court. The task before this Court

is to ascertain whether this appeal emanates from an Order pronounced by the Provincial High

Court in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction. Thus, the Court of Appeal is empowered to

Page 5 of 7

evaluate the correctness of the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction by the Provincial High

Court. Similarly, the Provincial High Courts must also be cautious when exercising revisionary

jurisdiction in respect of the applications made against the Orders of the Magistrate's Court and

should take care to consider such applications as revision applications and not appeals.

As such, this court draws its attention to the findings of the Learned Provincial High Court Judge

which states that,

Accordingly, the Learned Provincial High Court Judge has analysed and evaluated the evidence

placed before the learned Magistrate by the 1st Party-Respondent as well as the 2nd party-

Page 6 of 7

petitioner. Since the 2nd Party-Petitioner had failed to establish possession from the evidence

placed before the Magistrates court, the Learned Provincial High Court Judge had affirmed the

order of the learned Magistrate.

The 2nd Party-Petitioner-Petitioner (Appellant) [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Appellant] had not substantiated that he was in possession of the disputed land, two months

immediately before the date of filing of the information or that he was forcibly dispossessed

from the disputed portion of land.

It is worthy to note that although the Appellant had invoked the Revisionary Jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa holden in Ratnapura, the Appellant has not established

that a grave injustice had been caused or that a miscarriage of justice had been caused to the

Appellant which shocks the conscience of Court to exercise revisionary jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court. Thus, it is imperative to note that the Appellant had not substantiated

that exceptional circumstances existed to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial

High Court of Sabaragamuwa Province holden at Ratnapura.

In this respect, the court draws attention to the case of Bank of Ceylon vs. Kaleel and Other

[2004] (1) S.L.R 284, where it was held that,

...to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must have occasioned a

failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which is beyond an error or defect of

irregularity that an ordinary person instantly react to it the order complained of is of

such a nature which would have shocked the conscience of the court.

Further, in the case of Sunil Chandrakumara vs. Veloo [2001] (3) S.L.R 91, Jayasinghe J.

emphasized that,

Revision is a discretionary remedy; it is not available as of right. This power that flows

from Article 138 of the constitution is exercised by the Court of Appeal on an application

Page 7 of 7

made by a party aggrieved or ex mere moto, this power is available even when there is

no right of appeal.

The Petitioner in a revision application only seeks the indulgence of the Court to remedy

a miscarriage of justice. He does not assert it as a right. Revision is available unless it is

restricted by the constitution or any other law.

In view of the afore cited Judicial dictums, it clearly shows that the Appellant in this appeal had

failed to adequately establish the existence of exceptional circumstances resulting in a

miscarriage of justice for the revision application to succeed at the Provincial High Court.

As such, the Appellant cannot use the power of revision in lieu of an appeal. Therefore, it

manifests that the revision application filed by the Appellant is not tenable in law. Thus, I hold

that the Learned Provincial High Court Judge has very correctly affirmed the Order of the

Learned Magistrate dated 22.09.2015 and dismissed the revision application of the 2nd Party-

Petitioner-Petitioner (Appellant). Therefore, we see no reason for us to interfere with the order

of the Learned Provincial High Court Judge dated 12.06.2018 and we affirm the same.

Hence, this Appeal preferred by the 2nd Party-Petitioner-Petitioner (Appellant) is dismissed with

tax cost.

Appeal dismissed.

I agree.
