This is a revisionary application filed on 05.07.2022 against the order of the

learned High Court Judge of the Jaffna High Court dated 24.06.2022 refusing

bail for the Suspect-Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as 1st Petitioner)

who is presently in the remand prison of Jaffna. The application further seeks

granting of bail to the 1st petitioner.

The facts of the case are as follows. The 1st petitioner has been taken into

custody on or about 17.12.2020 in Point Pedro for committing an offence under

S. 54 (a) and (b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act No. 17 of 1929

as amended (hereinafter referred to as the Drugs Act) for possessing 212 grams

of heroin in which 103 grams were of pure quantity. Being remanded by the

4

CA-CPA-74-22 Page 4 of 6 02/03/2023 IJ-12-23

learned Magistrate of Mallakam on 23.12.2020, the 1st petitioner filed for bail

on 01.02.2020 to the Jaffna HC which was refused. Thereafter a second bail

application was filed on 01.10.2020 and was refused on 24.06.2022.

The 1st petitioner claims an involvement of one Suthaharan Lohini who was

arrested alongside him with 23 grams of heroin where she has maliciously given

information against the 1st petitioner to incriminate him. Furthermore, she has

been released on bail in 2021. However, the respondents claim that there is no

connection of one Lohini to the 1st petitioners case as she was arrested 25 kms

away from him and was released on bail due to the lower quantity of heroin as

opposed to the 1st petitioner. The facts are at dispute herein therefore this Court

would leave the trial judge to determine the truth and would not give much

emphasis to it at this stage.

The 1st petitioner states that he invoked the revisionary powers of this Court on

the following exceptional circumstances;

(a) the 1st petitioner being incarcerated in Jaffna and his wife (2nd petitioner),

the only person who could act on behalf of him living in Colombo, there is

extremely limited contact and communication between them.

(b) The transport restrictions have resulted in traveling difficulties and

difficulty in obtaining certified copies.

(c) Delay in obtaining affidavit from the suspect due to traveling restrictions

and delay in obtaining translated copies. (Elaborations mentioned in the

petition)

The 1st petitioner prays for the granting of bail from this Court on the

following grounds;

(a) Government Analysts report has been issued on 29.01.2021 and no

indictment has been filed until the date of this petition.

(b) Petitioner in remand for over 19 months (25 months until the day of

arguments)

5

CA-CPA-74-22 Page 5 of 6 02/03/2023 IJ-12-23

(c) The 1st Petitioner denies the allegations of the possession of heroin

and claims he is incriminated as mentioned above.

(d) The 1st Petitioner believes evidence alleged to be against him is

fabricated against him and there is no sufficient admissible evidence

against him.

(e) The 1st petitioner has no criminal cases pending against him and

there are no cases in which he has been found guilty.

During the arguments the learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the

petitioner further submitted to this Court that due to the difficulty in

language and difficulty in communication with the counsel of his choice

he is deprived of a fair trial, further, he is unable to communicate with

anyone. The State Counsel appearing for the respondents stated that the

exceptional circumstances do not exist in this matter and the indictment

has been filed in last October and date is fixed for trial. The learned SC

further submitted that the order of the learned HC judge is not illegal to

be subjected to the revisionary powers of this Court. And that the

exceptional circumstances do not warrant invoking revision. It was further

submitted that the averments of the petition do not elucidate how the order

of the learned HC judge is illegal and this Court exercising revisionary

jurisdiction without such grounds would open floodgates to bad precedent.

The learned SC submitted to this Court that the 1st petitioner can always

obtain assistance from counsel in Jaffna or through legal aid in Jaffna.

This Court is inclined to the submissions of the respondents. It is well

settled law that the power of revision vested in this Court can be exercised

and in certain circumstances ought to be exercised when the impugned

order is tainted with illegalities or entered without jurisdiction or in excess

of jurisdiction. As reiterated in several Judgments of this Court where a

6

CA-CPA-74-22 Page 6 of 6 02/03/2023 IJ-12-23

strong case for the interference of this Court is made out or a miscarriage

of justice has occurred, this Court is obliged to revise such an order. We

see no reason to interfere with the order delivered by the learned High

Court Judge of Jaffna. While this Court acknowledges the 1st petitioner

has been incarcerated from a considerably long period of time, as the

indictment is already filed and date is fixed for the trial this Court does

not envision a need of granting bail to the suspect petitioner at this

instance.
