Judgment

The Petitioner-Appellant has preferred this appeal to canvass the Order dated

21.01.2016 of the learned High Court Judge which dismissed the revision application

filed by the Petitioner-Appellant on the basis that no exceptional circumstances

exist for the Petitioner-Appellant to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court to exercise its power of revision.

The 1st Respondent had taken up a preliminary objection that no exceptional

circumstances were pleaded by the Petitioner-Appellant to exercise the revisionary

jurisdiction of Court. The learned High Court Judge upheld the said preliminary

objection and dismissed the application of the Petitioner-Appellant in limine. Being

aggrieved by the said Order of the learned High Court Judge dated 21.01.2016, the

Petitioner-Appellant had preferred this appeal to this Court.

When this matter was taken up for argument, the learned Counsel for the 1st

Respondent had taken up a preliminary objection that the appeal preferred against

the Order of the learned High Court Judge is not a final order and that Petitioner-

Appellant has not followed the procedure under Court of Appeal [Procedure for

appeals from High Courts] Rules 1988.

Any person who shall be dissatisfied with any Judgment or final order or

sentence pronounced by a High Court in the exercise of the Appellate or

revisionary jurisdiction vested in it by Article 154P(3)(b) of the Constitution may

prefer an appeal to the Court of Appeal against such Judgment for any error in

law or in fact.

Page 3 of 11

By lodging within fourteen days from the time of such judgment or order being

passed or made with such High Court, a petition of appeal addressed to the Court

of Appeal.

Hence, it was the contention of the 1st Respondent that Rule 2 is only applicable to

final orders and that the impugned order delivered by the learned High Court Judge

upholding the preliminary objection is not a final order.

In this respect, it is worthy to note the decision in Pathirana Vs. Goonawardene

and others [CA PHC 16/2016], where it was observed that the Order of the High

Court was made upon an application made by the Petitioner to issue notice on the

Respondent. It was held that although the Order refusing to issue notice on the

Respondents finally determined the matter, if the High Court decided to issue

notice, the matter would not have been finally determined. On this basis, the Court

regarded an Order refusing to issue notice as an interlocutory order that did not

come within the scope of Article 154(6) of the Constitution.

In the instant case, if the learned High Court Judge overruled the preliminary

objection taken up by the Respondents, inquiry should proceed and the merits of

the application have to be determined.

It was decided in the case of S.L.M. Naim Vs. Mohammed Naina Marikkar Haseeb

and Others [CA PHC 223/2006 decided on 28.02.2019] that there is no right of

appeal available against interim orders of the High Court.

The impugned Order of the learned High Court Judge which this appeal is preferred

against is an interlocutory order. Thus, the Appellant is not entitled to invoke the

appellate jurisdiction of this Court.

Be that as it may, it is relevant to note that the learned High Court Judge upheld

the preliminary objection and dismissed the revision application of the Petitioner in

limine, on the assumption that no exceptional circumstances exist for the Petitioner-

Appellant to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court.

It is noteworthy that the Petitioner-Appellant in paragraph 11 of the Petition of

Appeal had stated that any one of the following will constitute an exceptional

circumstance.

Page 4 of 11

I. The learned Magistrate has gone completely beyond her power and the order

made is per incuriam.

II. The learned Magistrate has completely misunderstood the nature of the

proceedings, in that she assumed it to be criminal when it is civil, and the order

is manifestly erroneous.

III. The learned Magistrate has questioned the validity of the award, for which she

has no power and if the employee was not satisfied with the award, she should

have sought a Writ of Certiorari from the High Court.

IV. The Order of the Magistrate will shock the conscience of any right-thinking person

as the money lawfully due to this public institution is unjustly denied by the

unlawful order of the learned Magistrate, here the cooperative society, the

Petitioner-Appellant had no opportunity to present its case in the Magistrates

Court, as the parties in the Magistrates Court are the Registrar of Cooperative

Societies and the defaulter (employee). The Petitioner was not a party in the

Magistrates Court (paragraph 3 of the Petition) and the petitioner has no right of

appeal. It is a failure of justice.

In view of the aforesaid reasons, Court observes that exceptional circumstances

prima facie exist for Petitioner-Appellant to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of

the Provincial High Court of Kalutara against the Order of the learned Magistrate.

It is incumbent upon the Court of Appeal to ascertain whether any miscarriage of

justice was caused to the Petitioner-Appellant by the Orders of the learned

Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge or whether any injustice was caused to

the Petitioner-Appellant due to the findings of fact and law of the learned

Magistrate.

Moreover, even when there was no right of appeal or no proper appeal made, there

are instances where Courts exercised revisionary jurisdiction in circumstances where

appeals were preferred.

On this premise, it is to be observed that in the case of King Vs. Seeman Alias

Semma [9 C.L.W 76], it was held that the Supreme Court has power to treat an

appeal which is out of time as an application in revision.

Page 5 of 11

Similarly, in the case of Nissanka Vs. The State [2001] 3 S.L.R 78, Kulatilake J.

emphasized that revisionary jurisdiction is not faltered by the fact that the

Accused-Appellant has not availed the right of appeal within the specified time.

It is worthy to note that it was held in Sunil Chandra Kumara Vs. Veloo [2001] 3

S.L.R 91, that revision is available even where there is no right of appeal, but not

as a right and only on the indulgence of Court to remedy a miscarriage of justice.

This power flows from Article 138 of the Constitution which is exercised by the Court

of Appeal, on application made by a party aggrieved or ex mero motu.

Furthermore, the Court draws the attention to the following Indian authorities which

dealt with the question of conversion of an appeal into a revision application.

In Bahori Vs. Vidya Ram [AIR 1978 Alld. 299], the Court opined that though there

is no specific provision for conversion of an appeal into revision or vice versa, the

Court in the exercise of inherent power under Section 151 of the Indian Civil

Procedure Code may permit such conversion in the interest of Justice.

Section 839 of Civil Procedure Code which deals with Inherent Powers, is a verbatim

reproduction of Section 151 of the Indian Code of Civil Procedure of 1908.

It has been held in the case of Reliance Water Supply Service of India Vs. Union

of India [1972 (4) SCC 168, AIR 1971 SC 2083], that High Court was right in

converting the appeal into revision.

Similarly, the Case of Bar Council of India, New Delhi Vs. Manikant Tiwari [AIR

1983 Allahabad 357], held that rejecting the appeal on the ground of

maintainability would mean to call upon the Appellant to challenge the impugned

Order by means of a revision and this will not serve any purpose and the Court

permitted the appeal to be converted into a revision.

In view of the aforesaid decisions, it is apparent that Court in exercising inherent

jurisdiction has full authority of law and discretion to convert an appeal to revision,

provided the interest of justice so demands.

It is needless to say that revisionary powers of Court are very wide and could be

exercised for the correction of errors of fact and law committed by all courts. Its

object is due administration of justice and the avoidance of a miscarriage of justice.

Page 6 of 11

The inherent powers of revisionary jurisdiction flow from Article 138 of the

Constitution and can be exercised by Court of Appeal, on an application made by a

party aggrieved or by Court on its own motion (ex mere motu).

Article 138 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka states:

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be reversed or

varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced

the substantial rights of parties or occasioned a failure of justice.

The above-mentioned provision of the Constitution and legal provisions clearly

demonstrate that any failure to adhere to legal provisions can be considered only if

such failure prejudices the substantial rights of the parties or occasions a failure of

justice.

As such, Court is inclined to see whether this appeal could be converted to revision.

It appears that 1st Respondent-Respondent-Respondent [hereinafter referred to as

the 1st Respondent] K.D. Ranjani had been an employee of the Petitioner-Appellant,

Bulathsinhala Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society and during her period in service at

the said Cooperative Society had caused a loss by way of goods, stamps and a bank

overdraft that amounted to Rs. 461,782.92/-.

The Petitioner-Appellant Society [hereinafter referred to as the Appellant] had

referred the said matter to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies for arbitration

with the aim of recovering the said loss amounting to Rs. 461,782.92/- from the said

defaulting employee, the 1st Respondent namely K.D. Ranjani.

Apparently, the Appellant, [the Petitioner-Appellant Society] had obtained an award

for Rs. 461,782.92/- in terms of Section 58 of the Co-Operative Statute and filed the

relevant certificate in the Magistrates Court of Matugama under case bearing No.

99735/13 to recover the said amount.

When the said matter came up before the learned Magistrate, preliminary objection

with regard to the maintainability of the Magistrates Court case under Section 58

of the Co-Operative Societies Law was taken up. It had been raised by the 1st

Respondent that Section 58 of the Corporative Societies Law stipulates a special

procedure to recover any sum based on the arbitrators award and that Section 58

Page 7 of 11

of the Co-Operative Societies Law is applicable only in relation to the loan, damage

and other relevant incidents and not for the alleged investigations.

As such, it was the contention of the 1st Respondent that the Appellant had not

followed the proper procedure in terms of Section 58 of the Co-Operative Societies

Law and that Co-Operative Society [Appellant] is not entitled to file a certificate in

the Magistrates Court.

However, the learned Magistrate had taken the matter for inquiry and delivered the

Order on 05.01.2015 dismissing the application of the Petitioner-Appellant.

It is pertinent to note that the Petitioner-Appellant Society had obtained an award

under Section 58 of the Co-Operative Society Statute, a Section which is identical

with the provisions of the Co-Operative Societies Law No. 05 of 1972, to recover the

dues ordered in the said award. Complainant-Respondent-Respondent in this appeal,

the Commissioner of Co-Operative Development and Registrar of Cooperative

Societies Western Province had issued a certificate to the Magistrates Court of

Matugama under Section 59 of the Statute to recover the dues as a fine.

The proceedings in the Magistrates Court pertaining to the instant action has been

initiated under Section 59(4) of the Cooperative Societies Law, on a certificate

issued by the applicant to the Magistrate in terms of paragraph (c) of subsection (1)

of Section 59.

Section 59(4) states:

Where a certificate is issued to a Magistrate under paragraph (c) of subsection

(1), the Magistrate shall thereupon summon such defaulter before him to show

cause why further proceedings for the recovery of the amount should not be

taken against him, and in default of sufficient cause being shown, the amount

shall be deemed to be a fine imposed by a sentence of the Magistrate on such

defaulter for an offence punishable with fine only or not punishable with

imprisonment

In Thambiah Seevaratnam Vs. Assistant Commissioner of Cooperative

Development Jaffna [79(II) NLR 104,105] it is stated that the Co-operative

Societies Ordinance was repealed by the Cooperative Societies Law No.5 of 1979 and

that the latter entered into force from 11.10.1972.

Page 8 of 11

The Supreme Court in Mohideen Vs. Assistant Commissioner of Cooperative

Development Kalmunai [80 NLR 206] was called upon to interpret Section 53(5) of

the Cooperative Societies Ordinance and Pathirana J. held that the only grounds that

can be urged before the Magistrate are that

(i) The Magistrate has no jurisdiction because the last known place of

business or residence does not fall within the local jurisdiction of the

Magistrate.

(ii) That he had paid the amount.

(iii) That he is not the defaulter in that he is not the person from whom the

amount is due.

I am of the view that this is the correct interpretation to be adopted in interpreting

Section 59(4) of the Law to ascertain the scope of procedure before the Magistrates

Court. Thus, the Appellant cannot argue before the Magistrate that the Respondent

did not have the power to file a certificate.

Apparently, the 1st Respondent had appeared in Court and moved to file legal

objections in the first instance and the learned Magistrate had allowed to file the

same.

When the proceedings in the Magistrates Court were initiated by filing a certificate,

the learned Magistrate was oblivious of the fact that it was a civil case to recover

the amount stated in the certificate from the 1st Respondent under Section 68 of the

Co-operative Societies Statute and not under Section 58 and 59.

It was the contention of the 1st Respondent that Complainant-Respondent-

Respondent had not initiated proceedings in the Magistrates Court in terms of

Cooperative Societies Law, and that she has not obtained any loan facility from the

Cop-Operative Society although the 1st Respondent was an employee of the said

Cooperative Society.

It is seen that Arbitrators award can be obtained in respect of a debt or damage, in

terms of Section 58 of the Statute. However, the impugned award has been obtained

for a loss caused by way of goods, stamps and a bank overdraft. Therefore, it was

contended that initiating proceedings in the Magistrates Court is irregular, improper

or not in accordance with the Cooperative Societies Law.

Page 9 of 11

However, the 1st Respondent has taken up the position that if there is any wrong

done by an employee, the Cooperative Society has to initiate proceedings in terms

of Section 68 of the Cooperative Societies Law and not under Section 58 of the same.

The 1st Respondent has taken up the position that the instant action cannot be

instituted and maintained under Section 59 of the Cooperative Societies Law, since

the said amount of money was not alone a liability. As such, the instant action could

have been filed under Section 68 of the Cooperative Societies Law as the said amount

of money was involved in a fraud, misappropriation or a criminal breach of trust. It

is apparent that the money misappropriated by the Respondent is clearly a deposit

on the business of this Society as referred to in Section 58.

It is evident that the nature of the dispute referred to in the instant action is not

limited to a debt owed to the Society by reason of a monetary loan.

Therefore, it is observable that there is no legal basis for the learned Magistrate to

decide that the recovery procedure in Section 59 is limited to recovery of a loan.

Hence, the Complainant-Respondent-Respondent is empowered to initiate action in

terms of Section 59 of the Cooperative Societies Law with regard to misappropriation

of funds.

It is observable that if the instant matter is referred under Section 68 and not in

terms of Section 59, it gives rise to a situation where the Petitioner-Appellant

Society would not be able to recover the amount of money indicated in the

certificate.

It is to be noted that Section 68 [which is identical to Section 67 of the Co-Operative

Societies Law No. 05 of 1972] provides for the institution of proceedings in the

Magistrates Court for Criminal Breach of Trust where the Magistrate is empowered

to imprison and/or fine any person accused of the same after the summary trial.

Therefore, it is clear that proceedings under Section 68 are designed to hold a person

liable for a criminal offence and not designed to allow a complaint to recover the

money which has been misappropriated.

On this premise, it clearly manifests that the Law itself is designed to permit two

actions in instances where misappropriation is involved. One action can be instituted

in terms of Section 59 of the Co-Operative Societies Law to recover the loss or

Page 10 of 11

damage caused to the Society by the acts of misappropriation while the other action

could be filed in terms of Section 68 of the Co-Operative Societies Law to hold the

1st Respondents criminal liability for misappropriation.

It was held in the case of Kotuwegedara Siripala Ranawaka Vs. Co-Operative

Society Ltd., Polonnaruwa-Daya gamage [CA PHC 184/2012 C.A.M 21.07.2015];

It is salient to note that in the above case, the Appellant was indicted in the High

Court for criminal charges and it was not to recover the money due to the Society.

An Arbitrator held an inquiry into the alleged misappropriation and made a

determination that the Appellant is responsible for the said charge and the money

should be recovered from him.

In view of the aforesaid reasons, I hold that the learned Magistrate has misdirected

herself and erred in law by deciding the Complainant-Respondent-Respondent should

have instituted an action to recover the amount due in terms of Section 68 of the

Co-Operative Societies Law instead of Section 58.

Therefore, it is my considered view that Registrar of Corporative Societies

[Complainant-Respondent-Respondent] is entitled to make use of the provisions in

Penal Law to recover money in terms of Section 59 (1) (c) of the Co-Operative

Societies Law as a fine.

It is worthy to note that this position was clearly established by Section 59 (4) of the

Principal Act, by amending Act No. 11 of 1992 which stipulates that,

Any defaulter sentenced to a term of imprisonment in default of the fine

imposed in accordance with Section 291 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No.15 of 1979, shall not be absolved from the payment of any sum of money

mentioned in the certificate specified in Section 59(1) (c).

According to the said amended Section 59(4), it is clear that serving of a jail

sentence imposed due to the failure to pay a fine shall not be a bar to collect the

money due upon an Arbitral award made under the Cooperative Societies Act.

It is interesting to note that in the case of Ambawa Thrift Credit Co-operative

Society Vs D. M. Sumana Dissanayake and Co-operative Development

Commissioner [C.A (PHC) 168/2011 C.A.M 16.01.2015], K. T. Chitrasiri J.

emphasized In terms of Section 291(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the

Legislature has permitted the particular Cooperative Society to recover the monies

Page 11 of 11

due from persons concerned despite the fact that the particular person had served

the jail sentence imposed due to the non-payment of the fine that was imposed

[Emphasis added]

According to the circumstances of the instant case and considering the judicial

decisions mentioned above, it is apparent that Court can exercise Inherent

Jurisdiction and also exercise the discretion of Court to convert the impugned appeal

into revision, in the interest of justice.

On this premise, it is pertinent to note that if an appeal is preferred where there is

no right of appeal or the Order against which the appeal was made is not an

appealable Order, Court has discretion to convert the appeal to revision if there is

a miscarriage of justice.

In view of the aforesaid reasons, it amply shows that the learned Magistrate of

Matugama has erred in law and facts and come to an erroneous conclusion by

dismissing the application of the Registrar of Corporative Societies [Complainant-

Respondent-Respondent]. It prejudices the substantial rights of the Complainant-

Respondent-Respondent which amounts to a miscarriage of justice. In view of the

legal maxim actus curiae neminem gravabit, no man would be prejudiced by an

act of Court.

Since there is a miscarriage of justice and a great injustice caused to the Petitioner-

Appellant in this appeal by the application of the Complainant-Respondent-

Respondent being dismissed, I hold that the learned Magistrates Order dated

05.01.2015 is bad in law. Hence, the said Order of the learned Magistrate and the

Order of the learned High Court Judge dated 21.01.2016 should be set aside. Thus,

we allow the appeal.

Appeal allowed.
