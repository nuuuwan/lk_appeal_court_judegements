The said Permit holder had nominated the 7th Respondent as his successor which is marked as 7R1a. The said nomination had been registered in the Land Ledger No. 4919 on 12-03-1969 (R2). Thereafter, the Crown Grant bearing No. GP.5110/LL4919 dated 11-02-1985 was granted to the said David pertaining to the said land which is marked as P1. The Petitioner states that the said Paranavithanage David died on 19-11-1998 without nominating a successor to the said land in the said Crown Grant, and therefore, under Section 71 of the said Act, the Petitioner, being the oldest son of the original grantee is entitled to the succession of the said Crown Grant. The Petitioner further states that the decision of the 5th Respondent (District Secretary of Galle) to grant the succession to the 7th Respondent who is the youngest son of the grantee, is illegal, unreasonable, ultra-vires and a violation of the principles of natural justice.",

In this scenario, on his death, and the death of his spouse, and in the absence of a subsequent nomination prior to his death, the original nomination stands valid in law.

In this case a Divisional Court without dealing with the merits of the case discharged the rule on the ground that the applicant had suppressed or misrepresented the facts material to her application. The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court that there had been a suppression of material facts by the applicant in her affidavit and therefore it was justified in refusing a writ of prohibition without going into the merits of the case. In other words, so rigorous is the necessity for a full and truthful disclosure of all material facts that the Court would not go into the merits of the application, but will dismiss it without further examination\".",
