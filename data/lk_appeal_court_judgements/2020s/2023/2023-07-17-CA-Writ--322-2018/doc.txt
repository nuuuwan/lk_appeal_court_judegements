This is an application filed by Lanka Electricity Company (Private) Ltd (hereinafter

referred to as the Petitioner) seeking a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari

quashing directives and/or decisions issued by the Commissioner of Labour (hereinafter

referred to as the Commissioner). The application challenges the decisions of the

Commissioner conveyed at three separate instances (marked P14, P16 and P17)

considering the grievances of the respondent employees of the petitioner Company. The

5th- 28th respondents who are the employees of the petitioner company are made party

to this application for the purpose of notice.

The facts of the case are as follows. The petitioner is a duly incorporated company under

the provisions of the Companies Act No 07 of 2007 and is the largest electricity

distribution company in Sri Lanka. Presently, there are 24 customer service centres

island wide, managed through 7 branch offices. The task of managing materials that

were delivered to the customer service centres was originally performed by a technician

attached to each customer service centre and not by someone specifically designated for

4

CA-WRT-322-2018 Page 4 of 10 12/07/2023 IJ- 24-23

this task. Petitioner submits that as they (5-28 respondents) had neither training nor

requisite qualification

in the field it became difficult to control materials and to ensure accountability. Thereby

to redress this issue, around the year 2007 the post of Stores Assistant Grade II was

introduced and presently there are 23 employees serving in this post.

Addition to the said Store Assistants serving in the customer service centres, there are

also store assistants in the 7 branch offices. The petitioner submits that there is a

significant distinction between the two groups as the latter acts as the conduit between

the main stores of the petitioner Company and customer service centres. Store

assistants attached to the customer service centres work the same working hours as

their technicians which is 7.30 am 5.00 pm on weekdays and store assistants attached

to branch offices have different working hours of 8.30 am 5.00 pm. Petitioner submits

that this distinction is due to the difference in roles and functions, and to maintain the

practice adopted by the petitioner in respect of the technicians at customer service

centres.

Petitioner further submits that although the store assistants in the customer service

had no objection about the working hours, on or around 16.03.2012, the said 23 store

assistants in the customer service centres (5th-27th respondents) referred a complaint to

the General Manager of the petitioner company of the grievance of them working for 9

hours (7.30 am 5.00 pm) and that it is allegedly in contrary to the Shop and Office

Employees (Regulation of Employment and Remuneration) Act No. 19 of 1954 as

amended (hereinafter referred to as the SOE Act). They further sought an amendment to

the working hours by the petitioner company. Upon explaining the rationale for the

difference in working hours, the petitioner submits that 5th 27th respondents

accepted the rationale given, however on or around February 2016 the LECO branch of

the 4th Respondent trade union has again raised the said matter.

Petitioner claims that there is no illegality in the said working hours and SOE Act has

no application to the said employees. Further, even under the Act, the said employees

never worked beyond the weekly prescribed working hours of 45 hours. The

petitioner had also sought opinion from the Employers Federation of Ceylon and Labour

Standards Division of Labour Department with respect to the working hours. In

5

CA-WRT-322-2018 Page 5 of 10 12/07/2023 IJ- 24-23

response, Employers Federation of Ceylon stated a similar position to that of the

petitioner (marked P8).

On or about 22.06.2017, petitioner received a notice from the Assistant Commissioner

of Labour directing the petitioner to be present at an inquiry on 05.07.2017 with regard

to a complaint lodged by 4th Respondent. The inquiry was conducted by the labour

officer named as the 3rd Respondent. Upon its conclusion, on or about 28.05.2018 the

2nd Respondent communicated a decision and/or directive (marked P14) which held

that the employees fall within the purview of the SOE Act and that they are made to

work 9.5 hours. It further directed that the petitioner is ought to pay the said employees

overtime in respect to the time of work which exceeded the regular working hours of 9

hours (including the lunch hour).

The 2nd Respondent has communicated a further decision on 08.09.2018 which was

received by the petitioner around 02.10.2018 (marked P16). This has directed the

petitioner to make payments of Rs.3, 788, 011.59, as overtime payments for the 5th28th

respondents for the period of 15.06.2013 to 31.07.2018. A separate schedule with

amounts that need to be paid to each respondent is annexed to this directive. The

petitioner claims that this particular directive includes the 28th Respondent who is an

employee of the petitioner company but not attached to the customer service centres.

However, 1st-3rd respondents submit that the name of the 28th respondent appears as a

complainant in document marked P6. Thereafter, the 2nd respondent has issued

another letter dated 14.11.2018 directing the petitioner to pay an amount of

Rs.2,908,656.20 as overtime payment to the employees for the time period of

01.01.2015 to 31.07.2018 (marked P17). The 1st-3rd respondents submit to this Court

that P17 was a subsequent directive issued to correct the amount in P16 as the

applicable period reduced, and that the faulty date of P16 mentioned in P17 is due to a

typographical error.

The fundamental contention at the hand of this Court is whether the respondent

employees are governed by the SOE Act. The petitioner has submitted to this Court that,

the particular customer service centres are tasked with providing services to the general

public such as installation of new electricity connections etc., thus in cognizance of full

functions these centres do not fall under the definition of either shop or office. Section

68 (1) of the SOE Act defines the office as follows;

6

CA-WRT-322-2018 Page 6 of 10 12/07/2023 IJ- 24-23

office means any establishment maintained for the purpose of the transaction of the

business of any bank, broker, insurance company, shipping company, joint stock or other

company, estate agent, advertising agent, commission agent or forwarding or indenting

agent, or for the purposes of the practice of the profession of any accountant, and includes

(a) the office or clerical department of any shop, factory, estate, mine, hotel, club or other

place of entertainment, or of any other industrial, business or commercial undertaking

(including the business of transporting persons or goods for fee or reward and any

undertaking for the publication of newspapers, books or other literature), and

(b) such other institutions or establishments as may be declared by regulation to be offices

for the purposes of this Act, whether or not they are maintained for the purposes of any

profession, trade or business or for the purposes of profit;

In the instant matter, the petitioner company is a body incorporated under the

Companies Act. The Gazette No. 11,564 of 24.10.1958 where the Section 39B Part IV of

the regulations stated under the SOE Act states that the following establishments are

declared to be offices for the purposes of the Act: -

PART IV- PROVISIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN CLASSES OF SHOPS AND OFFICES

AND PERSONS EMPLOYED THERE

(3) Every establishment maintained for the purpose of administering the business of

.

(iv) anybody, corporate or incorporate

Thereby, unambiguously the petitioner company, Lanka Electricity Company (Pvt.) Ltd.

accords with the definition of office as per the Act. Section 68 (2) of the SOE Act states;

(2) For the purposes of this Act, a person shall be deemed to be employed in or about

the business of a shop or office if he is wholly or mainly employed (a) in a shop, in

connexion with the serving of customers or the receipt of orders or the dispatch or delivery

of goods, or as the case may be, in an office, in connexion with the business for the

purposes of the transaction of which the office is maintained;

7

CA-WRT-322-2018 Page 7 of 10 12/07/2023 IJ- 24-23

(b )in the service of the employer upon any work, whether in the shop or office or

outside it, which is ancillary to the business carried on in that shop or office, and

notwithstanding that he receives no reward for his labour; but he shall not be deemed to

be so employed if his only employment in the service of the employer is in the capacity of

a caretaker or watcher [Emphasis added].

The document marked P5 (a) indicates the tasks/duties expected of respondent

employees who are store assistants attached to the customer service centres of the

petitioner company. They are assigned with functions such as controlling material,

catering to customer needs etc., where they perform functions that are clearly ancillary

to the principal purpose of the petitioner company, supply of electricity. Thereby, the

respondent employees clearly fall within the ambit of the Act. Within this context, the

argument of the petitioner, that the respondent employees provide a service to general

public is found to be unsound by this Court and, is thus relinquished. The respondent

employees are duly governed by the SOE Act and should be subjected to the provisions

of the Act. As his Lordship Chief Justice G.P.S. de Silva echoed in Rajapakse Vs

Dissanayake (1998) 1 Sri. L.R. 398, On a reading of the entire Act, it seems to me that

there is no warrant for giving a narrow or restrictive meaning to the word employee. To

do so would tend to defeat the object of the Act and render its salutary provisions largely

nugatory.

Diverting to the working hours mandated by law, the Section 3 of the SOE Act mentions

the following;

3. (1) Subject to the provisions of any regulation referred to in subsection (3) and subject

to the provisions of subsection (5), the normal period during which any person may be

employed in or about the business of any shop or office

(a) on any one day shall not exceed eight hours, and

(b) in any one week shall not exceed forty-five hours.

The period referred to in this subsection shall not include any interval allowed for rest or

for a meal under any provisions of this Act or any interruption permitted by any regulation

referred to in subsection (3).

The relevant excerpts of the Regulations of Employment issued under the Act which are

indicated in the PART I of Regulations Chapter of the Act are as following;

PART I - REGULATION OF EMPLOYMENT

(Gazette No.314 of 21.4.1978)

2 (1) No male who has not attained the age of 18 years and no female shall be employed

in or about the business of any shop or office for any period (including overtime and an

interval for rest or for a meal and any interruption permitted under regulation 4)

exceeding 9 hours a day.

Gazette No.10, 899 of 2.3.1956. Gazette No.12, 553 of 21.7.1961.

3..

4..

5.

6. The period during which a person may be employed overtime in or about the business

of any shop or office shall not exceed an aggregate of twelve hours in any one week.

7.No person shall be employed overtime in or about the business of any shop or

office, unless he is paid separately for such overtime work in respect of each hour,

at a rate not less than one and one-half times the hourly rate of his ordinary remuneration.

The remuneration payable for any part of an hour of overtime work done by him shall be

determined in the proportion that part bears to the hour.

It is ex facie apparent that the respondent employees have worked from 7.30am-5.00pm

for 9.5 hours exceeding the maximum daily working hours from 30 minutes. The

Commissioner has conveyed its decision regarding the illegality of such working hours

on 28.05.2018 via the document marked P14 directing to pay for the overtime. The SOE

Act has granted powers to the Commissioner by the following provisions. Section 53 (3)

of the Act has empowered the Commissioner to direct the employers by written notice

to pay any amount or balance amount unpaid from the remuneration required under

the Act.

9

CA-WRT-322-2018 Page 9 of 10 12/07/2023 IJ- 24-23

(3) Where an employee has not been paid the whole or a part of the remuneration required

by this Act to be paid to him by his employer, the Commissioner may, if he thinks fit so to

do, by written notice require the employer to pay such amount or the balance of such

amount to the Commissioner within the time specified in the notice so that the

Commissioner may remit it to such employee. Where the employer when served with such

notice pays such amount or such balance directly to such employees instead of

transmitting it to the Commissioner as required by such notice, he shall be deemed not to

have paid such amount or such balance to such employee.

46. (1) The Commissioner of Labour shall be the officer in charge of the general

administration of this Act.

(2) Subject to any general or special directions of the Commissioner, any Deputy or

Assistant Commissioner of Labour may exercise, perform or discharge any power, duty or

function of the Commissioner under this Act or under any regulation.

The Assistant Commissioner of Labour who is the 2nd respondent of the application has

been the entity that has decided and corresponded with the petitioner company at all

instances regarding the matter at hand. Under Section 46 (2) the Assistant

Commissioners are duly authorised to perform and discharge powers under the Act and

thereby the directives issued by the 2nd respondent are deemed to be legal by this Court.

Furthermore, upon perusal of the inquiry notes marked R1- R3 it is apparent to this

Court that the inquiry proceedings of this matter at the Commissioner have been

conducted duly without any concerning defects. Following such fair inquiry only the

directives marked P14, P16 and P17 are issued. The petitioner has raised concerns and

objections regarding the disputed Schedule to P17. As noted above, P17 is the directive

with revised the total amount payable, due to the change in the time period considered

for calculation. P17 further mentions that it annuls the prior directive marked P16.

According to the affidavit submitted by the 1st respondent all annexures are sent along

with P17 in the registered post, however the petitioner denies this. On the other hand,

the respondents have failed to submit a copy of such schedule of P17 that they claim to

have sent from there end, as well.

It is argued that the 1st Respondent, who has custody of the Schedule, should have

presented it instead of claiming to have sent it via registered post as stated in their

10

CA-WRT-322-2018 Page 10 of 10 12/07/2023 IJ- 24-23

objections. However, it should be noted that the failure to produce this Schedule, which

was prepared by the 1st Respondent, should not be considered as a mean to deprive the

legal entitlements of the 4-28 respondents. The total amount to be distributed among

these respondents is clearly stated in P17 and is documented in the file. However, it is

observed by this Court that it is essential to send a detailed schedule with amount

payable to each respondent employee as the total amount payable is revised. Further,

in the directive marked P17, the date of P16 is mentioned inadvertently and the

petitioner in his petition mentions this fact. This Court does not intend to be concerned

with the faulty date on P17 as it is a minuscule matter that has not posed a serious

threat to justice and proceed to accept the 1st-3rd respondents submission that it was a

typographical error.

In the instant matter, it is evident to this Court that the respondent employees are

unquestionably governed by the SOE Act and the Commissioner has correctly decided

on the matter directing the petitioner company to pay remunerations for the overtime

work of the respondent employees. Therefore, to effect the decision duly, this Court

directs the respondent Commissioner to re-send a copy of detailed schedule on the

revised amount mentioned in P17 to the petitioner company with detailed amounts

payable to each respondent employee, forthwith.

Application dismissed
