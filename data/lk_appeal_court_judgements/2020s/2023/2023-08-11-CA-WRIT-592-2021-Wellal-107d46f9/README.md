Sobhitha Rajakaruna J. (Acting P/CA)

The Petitioner claims that he is a 71-year-old, retired Associate Professor in Chemistry. The

instant Application, filed by him, is based on alleged errors contained in Part I [Multiple

Choice Questions] of the chemistry question paper [new syllabus] of the General Certificate

of Education [Advanced Level] Examination ('G.C.E. [A/L] Examination') conducted in all

three mediums, held on 21.10.2020. The Petitioner states that the participants of a meeting

held on 18.12.2020, including the Petitioner and twenty others, have discovered errors in 26

questions out of 50 and such errors are contained in question numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12,

14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, 48 and 49 (Vide- paragraph 9 of

the Petition of the Petitioner) of the said chemistry question paper under the new syllabus

('chemistry paper') . The Petitioner asserts that the Commissioner of Examinations to a certain

extent accepted that there were errors in Part I of the said chemistry paper. Another main

complaint of the Petitioner is that no Schools Examinations Advisory Committee has been

appointed by the Minister of Education in terms of the provisions of the Public Examinations

Page 5 of 11

Act No. 25 of 1968. The Petitioner states that the Commissioner of Examinations cloaking

himself under 'Secrecy' and/or 'Confidentiality' in conducting the said G.C.E. (A/L)

Examination has not taken any remedial steps to avoid errors in future examination papers,

and has also refrained from revealing the details of the members of the panel of the paper

setters and moderators of the said chemistry paper. Hence, the Petitioner alleges that he is

left with no other option other than to come before this Court to seek relief.

The Petitioners only substantive relief is reflected in paragraph (D) of the prayer of the

Petition and it reads:

"(D) Grant and issue writ in the nature of writ of prohibition, prohibiting / restraining the

Commissioner of Examination (3rd Respondent) from selecting and or appointing the

members of the panel of paper setters and moderators of the part I of the Chemistry

examination (new syllabus) paper of the General Certificate of Education (Advanced

Level) examination which was held on 21st October 2020 in setting and or moderating

Chemistry examination paper of any future examinations"

The Respondents contend that the Petitioner has no legal right or ground to maintain the

instant Application or to seek the reliefs contained in the prayer of the Petition. It is submitted

that the Petitioner has made this Application solely on his personal opinion, which is

unknown to the Respondents even without any inclination of the candidates who are

purportedly affected. Further, the Respondents argue that the candidates sitting future G.C.E.

(A/L) Examinations would be greatly prejudiced if the relief sought by the Petitioner is

granted, as there would be no consistency in future question papers if the entire panel of paper

setters is replaced. Moreover, the Respondents argue that this Court is not the proper forum

to decide the matter regarding the purported erroneous chemistry paper.

Primarily, I must draw my attention to the report marked 'R7' annexed to the statement of

objections of the Respondents. It should be considered a vital report as it has been issued after

the aforesaid discussion held on 18.12.2020 between the sixteen resource persons, including

four internal officers of the National Institute of Education ('NIE'). It is significant that the

Petitioner was also a member of the said panel of resource personnel. The said meeting has

been summoned on the instructions of the Director General of NIE based on a letter dated

Page 6 of 11

17.11.2020, addressed to the Secretary to the Ministry of Education by the Petitioner on the

purported errors contained in the said chemistry paper. Consequent to the said discussion, the

Director General of the NIE has drawn the attention of the Commissioner General of

Examinations as to what transpired at the said discussion, by his letter dated 18.02.2021 ('R6').

By such communication the said Director General expressed that the information contained

in the said report would be useful to conduct future examinations successfully. It is to be noted

that the said panel of resource persons has not recommended anything which has the same

effect of the contents of the prayer of the Petition.

Subsequently, a marking scheme has been formulated considering the said report and also the

outcome of the discussions held during the period between 24.10.2020 and 28.10.2020 in

relation to the flaws of the said chemistry paper. The Respondent's contention is that

formation of a marking scheme considering all above deliberations was to ensure that no

student would be prejudiced by any errors that were prevalent in the said chemistry paper. As

such, the Respondents argue that no prejudice has been caused to any of the respective

students due to the existence of any errors in the said chemistry paper.

I am mindful of the fact that the G.C.E. (A/L) Examination is one of the most competitive

examinations held in this country. To my mind this examination is a turning point in the life

of a student who completes their secondary education at school. The G.C.E. (A/L)

Examination has been widely considered to be a stepping stone for students who aspire

admission to universities locally and internationally. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain

the sanctity of this Examination. I do not attempt to concentrate in the instant Application

as to how the future of a Sri Lankan student is steered by this competitive and crucial

examination, although it is an area which needs to be focused on by all relevant stakeholders

who are bound to gear the education system here. Making an error even in a single question

of an examination paper of such a competitive examination cannot possibly be overlooked.

A mistake of fact or difference of ideologies in respect of a certain paradigm of any of the

subjects will cause immense prejudice to the candidates of the examination and such

differences can only be avoided through consensus and due deliberation among the

examiners/paper setters.

Page 7 of 11

Now I need to advert to the provisions of the said Public Examinations Act, which specifically

stipulates that a question paper that is set for any public examination shall, for the purposes

of the said Act, be a secret document from the time such paper is set until the lapse of half an

hour from the time fixed for the commencement of the answering of such paper by candidates

at the relevant examination. Any person who is appointed to set a question paper or a person

who is appointed to read answer scripts and assign marks to them is considered an 'examiner'

according to the interpretation section of the said Act. In terms of Section 13, if any person,

fraudulently or dishonestly communicates any information regarding the identity of any

examiner appointed or to be appointed to set any question paper, or any information relating

to the transmission of question papers or answer scripts, to any person who is not a person to

whom he is authorized to communicate such information, he shall be guilty of an offence

under this Act. Every person entrusted with any power, duty or function in connection with

any public examination should take and subscribe an oath of secrecy. In light of the above, it

is obvious that the hallmark of the provisions of the said Act is to duly conduct public

examinations to maintain a high degree of secrecy therein.

In this backdrop, I need to examine as to what extent this Court can intervene into the process

of setting the said chemistry paper and consider granting the reliefs prayed for in the prayer

of the Petition of the Petitioner. In other words, I must examine the strength of the arguments

raised by the Petitioner highlighting the said errors in order to arrive at a finality on the

question as to whether this Review Court could grant any of the reliefs as prayed for in the

prayer.

It is apparent that there is no specific denial by the Respondents to the effect that no errors

prevailed at all in the said chemistry paper. On a careful perusal of the report marked 'R7' it

implies that several experts after consideration have expressed views on several problematic

questions and answers of this chemistry paper. Based on the facts and circumstances of this

case, I cannot completely abstain from making any comment to the effect that no erroneous

questions were contained in the said chemistry paper. Apart from the alleged errors referred

to above, it is pertinent to note that the text in the instructions cage on the 1st page of the

question paper marked 'P2' declares that the said question paper consists of 9 pages whereas,

it consisted of only 8 pages. Even a mistake of this nature would easily create confusion in

Page 8 of 11

the mind of a candidate who is likely under pressure to complete the paper within the

stipulated time. The Respondents have failed to defend the allegations that no School

Examination Advisory Committee was appointed nor have they provided a reasonable

explanation for their inadvertence.

Anyhow, the Respondents assert that if the relief sought by the Petitioner is granted, the 3rd

Respondent would be compelled to appoint an entirely new panel of paper setters and

moderators, which may result in the appointment of such paper setters and moderators who

have no experience in paper setting. The Respondents further argue that the candidates who

would answer the question papers in the subject of chemistry at G.C.E. (A/L) Examinations

would be greatly prejudiced if the reliefs sought by the Petitioner is granted. It is contended

that only 8 out of the 9 members, who were part of the panel of paper setters for the G.C.E.

A/L chemistry paper for the year 2020, were re-appointed for the year 2021. Accordingly, the

panel of paper setters for the year 2021 consisted of 11 members, including 3 newly appointed

members. It is further submitted that a new moderator was appointed for the G.C.E. A/L

chemistry paper for the year 2021 and as such, the moderator who functioned in 2020 was

not re-appointed. This Court is not possessed with the reason behind the above changes and

perhaps it is due to the requirement of maintaining the secrecy of the identities of the panel of

paper setters and moderators.

For the reasons explained above and on an overall consideration of the circumstances of this

case, I am compelled to take the view that this Court, unless it is highly essential, should not

interfere in the process of setting question papers in A/L Examinations as it would affect the

sanctity of such competitive examinations. The thrust of the Petitioners case is not on the

usual grounds of review, but on the necessity of taking punitive measures to prevent the

recurrence of errors in question papers as averred by the Petitioner. According to the

Petitioner, not allowing the same examiners to continue to be on future panels of paper setters

and moderators is an essential step in order to ensure that the candidates will not be similarly

prejudiced in the future. I am reluctant to interfere with the process of setting the chemistry

paper as such a process demands a high degree of secrecy within it and also due to the

unavailability of adequate material before Court to overcome the state of institutional

incapacity in relation to the expert knowledge of this Court on the subject of chemistry. I do

Page 9 of 11

not doubt the inherent power of this Court to make orders even in the absence of expert

knowledge on chemistry if the process of decision making and the exercise of power by the

relevant authorities is eminently irrational or unreasonable. At the same time, I shall draw

my attention to the pronouncements in the case of Attorney General vs. The Great Eastern

Railway Co. (1880 (5) Appeal Cases 473) where the house of Lords has stated that the doctrine

of ultra vires ought to be reasonably, and not unreasonably, understood and applied.

The precedent enunciated in the said Great Eastern Railway Co. Case has been adopted by S.

N. Silva J. (As he was then) in Liyanage and others vs. Gampaha Urban Council and others

(1991) 1 Sri. L.R. 1. The House of Lords in the said case approved the doctrine of ultra vires

with some refinement that lent it a greater flexibility. The Lord Chancellor (Lord Selborne)

restated (at p. 478) therein the doctrine as follows,

"I assume that your Lordships will not now recede from anything that was determined in The

Ashbury Railway Company vs. Riche (1)1 ; It appears to me to be important that the doctrine of

ultra vires, as it was explained in that case, should be maintained. But I agree with Lord Justice

James that this doctrine ought to be reasonably, and not unreasonably, understood and applied,

and that whatever may fairly be regarded as incidental to, or consequential upon, those things

which the Legislature has authorized, ought not (unless expressly prohibited) to be held, by

judicial construction, to be ultra vires."

In addition to the above precedent, proportionality should be adopted in these proceedings to

strike a balance between the error highlighted by the Petitioner and the reliefs sought in the

prayer of the Petition. I wish to borrow the below information depicted in the article (by Barak

A, "Proportionality's Importance," Proportionality: Constitutional Rights and their Limitations

[Cambridge University Press 2012]):

"Indeed, the theory behind proportionality is not intended to merely categorize a case into a group

which solves the problem. Rather, proportionality is aimed at a constant review of the existence

1 (1875) of the Law Reports 653

Page 10 of 11

of a rational justification for the limitation imposed on the right, while taking into consideration

each cases circumstances".2

Even in an event this Court decides to accept the position that the said chemistry paper is

flawed by containing erroneous questions, it cannot be assumed that the Petitioner is entitled

to the reliefs prayed for in the prayer of the Petition in the same way such reliefs have been

formulated. This is because this Court should take serious cognizance of the fact that the

candidates have been allocated additional and reasonable marks according to a fresh marking

scheme prepared as a result of the deliberation and decisions reflected in 'R7'. Also, it is noted

that there is no single complaint from any of the candidates who sat the said chemistry paper

or from any other student who is to face future A/L chemistry examinations. In this vein, the

standing of the Petitioner to maintain the instant Application also becomes highly

questionable as raised by the Respondents, who assert that the Petitioner has no legal right

whatsoever to demand the entire panel of paper setters and moderators to be changed in its

entirety without any legal basis to seek reliefs. Prohibiting all the members of the panel of

paper setters and moderators who set the said chemistry paper can be equated to a life time

punishment against those officers whose names have not been divulged due to the

requirement of confidentiality propounded in the said Act.

In light of the above, I need to arrive at the conclusion that it is highly unreasonable and

disproportionate to grant the reliefs in the manner it was formulated in the prayer of the

Petition. Further, the Petitioner has failed to transform his claim to a stage where this Court

can use a reasonable ground of review to usurp the power of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th

Respondents. Anyhow, based on the findings illustrated earlier, this Court makes an

observation that it is the duty of the Commissioner of Examination and other relevant

authorities to conduct an appropriate inquiry, preserving the secrecy of the process and take

appropriate decisions in respect of the paper setters and the moderators of the chemistry paper

for the best interest of the candidates who sit future A/L Examinations. Anyhow, for the

reasons explained above, I proceed to dismiss this Application, subject to the above

observations.

Application is dismissed.
