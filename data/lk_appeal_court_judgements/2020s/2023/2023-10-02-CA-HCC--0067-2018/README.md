JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General for committing the offence

as mentioned below.

On or about the 13th April 2014 in Hallawa the accused-Appellant committed

the murder of Ritigahamula Prematilaka alias Siril which is an offence

punishable under Section 296 of Penal Code.

As the Appellant opted for a non-jury trial, the trial commenced before a

judge and the prosecution had led five witnesses and marked productions

P1-6 and closed the case. The Learned High Court Judge having satisfied

that evidence presented by the prosecution warrants a case to answer, called

for the defence and explained the rights of the accused. The Appellant gave

evidence from witness box and called a witness on his behalf.

After considering the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the

defence, the Learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellant as

charged and sentenced him to death on 20/03/2018.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

3 | P a g e

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. Appellant was connected via Zoom platform from prison during

the hearing.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. The testimony of the sole eye witness fails the test of credibility on the

following grounds.

a) The evidence of the witness contradicts with the medical

evidence.

b) The witness had failed to explain the injuries on the accused.

2. The Learned High Court Judge had misdirected herself regarding the

evidence of the defence and thereby had failed to evaluate the defence

evidence properly.

3. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to address her mind

adequately to the mitigatory pleas of sudden fight, provocation and

cumulative provocation which had been taken up by the defence and

which is supported by the evidence of the prosecution.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

According to the eye witness PW1 Manjula Kulatunga, on the day of the

incident at about 6.45 pm, he had gone to a house of a doctor to collect some

money. At that time the deceased was also in the garden of the doctors house

and had spoken to him. While they were talking in the garden of the doctors

house, suddenly the Appellant had come from the back side of the deceased

and stabbed with a knife in the neck of the deceased. At the time of

happening of the incident, the deceased stood very close to the witness.

Hence, the witness had identified the Appellant with the light emanating

from the doctors house. At the trial, PW1 had identified the knife which was

used by the Appellant to stab the deceased.

4 | P a g e

PW13,IP/Ekanayake who investigated the crime scene had noticed a bulb

was on in front of the doctors house and blood stains strewn in the garden.

PW16, Consultant JMO Ajith Jayasena who held the post mortem of the

deceased, expressed that there were 03 injuries on the deceaseds neck and

injury marked no. 01 caused the inevitable death and injuries no.02 and 03

could have happened with the movements of the deceased and the knife, at

the time of the attack.

Corroborating the evidence of PW1, the JMO opined that the injuries on the

deceased could have occurred with the knife marked as P1.

The Appellant was arrested by PW14, IP/Rathnayake while he was hiding in

backwoods and the knife P1 allegedly used to stab the deceased and a sarong

and a shirt with contained blood stains were found under the bed of the

Appellants bed room, in consequence to a statement made by the Appellant

under section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance. When the Appellant was

going to be arrested by the police, he had resisted such arrest. As such,

minimum force had been used to arrest him.

In the first ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the testimony of

the sole eye witness fails the test of credibility on the following grounds.

c) The evidence of the witness contradicts the medical evidence.

d) The witness had failed to explain the injuries on the accused.

In this case, the Appellant had admitted that he stabbed the deceased with

a knife brought from his house. Hence, Learned High Court Judge

considering this fact went on to analyse the evidence very accurately to find

out whether the Appellant had stabbed the deceased due to sudden fight or

provocation as claimed by him.

The High Court Judge had very correctly considered evidence given by PW1

who had seen the Appellant stabbing in the neck of the deceased while he

was standing and talking to the witness. This position of the witness had not

5 | P a g e

been contradicted at any time. Although the Appellant speak about a sudden

fight, PW1 had not seen such an incident.

Considering the circumstances under which PW1 had witnessed the

stabbing, a reasonable man could not accurately see all the injuries at the

time of the stabbing. The JMO had given a clear and detail evidence regarding

the injuries sustained by the deceased. Hence, it is incorrect to say that PW1

had given contradictory evidence against the medical evidence.

PW1 without any contradiction had given evidence in the Court keeping with

what he had seen on the day of the incident. This position has correctly been

endorsed by the Learned High Judge in judgment. The relevant portion is re-

produced below:

Hence, it is incorrect to say that the Learned High court Judge had not

properly evaluated the evidence given by the eye witness. The evidence given

by PW1 is not tainted with uncertainty or ambiguity.

Therefore, I conclude that the Appellant is not successful in his first ground

of appeal.

As the second and third appeal grounds are interconnected, those grounds

will be considered together hereinafter. The Appellant in his second ground

of appeal, contends that the Learned High Court Judge had misdirected

herself regarding the evidence of the defence and thereby failed to evaluate

the defence evidence properly.

In the third ground, the Appellant contends that the Learned High Court

Judge had failed to address her mind adequately to the mitigatory pleas of

6 | P a g e

sudden fight, provocation and cumulative provocation which had been taken

up by the defence and which is supported by the evidence of the prosecution.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the evidence of the

Appellant stabbing the deceased, went on to analyse his evidence to consider

whether the act of the Appellant falls under 296 or 297 of the Penal Code.

The relevant portions of the judgment are re-produced below:

Considering above portions of the judgment, the Learned High Court Judge

had very clearly, extensively and correctly considered the defence evidence

before she could reach her final decision. Hence, the contention raised in the

second and third grounds of appeal by the Appellant have no merit.

In the third ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the recovery made

under section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance has not been proved beyond

reasonable doubt.

Following the arrest of the Appellant in this case, a knife was recovered based

upon his statement to the police and the same was identified by PW2 as the

knife that was used to kill the deceased.

The admissibility of the recovery evidence under Section 27(1) of the

Evidence Ordinance had been discussed in several cases decided by the

Superior Courts of our country.

8 | P a g e

In this case, PW1 had vividly explained how the deceased was positioned

when he was brutally attacked. When PW1 looked at the deceased the

Appellant was stabbing the deceaseds neck.

Considering the evidence presented against the Appellant, I conclude that

the prosecution had succeeded in adducing highly incriminating evidence

against the Appellant and thereby has established the charge beyond

reasonable doubt.

As such, I conclude that this is not an appropriate case in which the findings

of the Learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala dated 20/03/2018 can be

interfered upon. Hence, I dismiss the Appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Kurunegala along with the original case record.
