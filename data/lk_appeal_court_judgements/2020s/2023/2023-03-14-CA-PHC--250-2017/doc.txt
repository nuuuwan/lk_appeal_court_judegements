Judgment

Factual Background

The Informant-Petitioner Tyron Lawrence Navaratne De Alwis had instituted action

bearing No. 51274/L on 19.11.2012 in the Magistrates Court of Kurunegala in terms of

Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 against the 1st, 2nd,

3rd and 4th Respondents in respect of a land dispute between the InformantPetitioner and

the said 1st 4th Respondents. The said 1st 4th Respondents are Municipal Council

Kurunegala, the Mayor of Municipal Council Kurunegala, Municipal Commissioner

Kurunegala and Engineer of Municipal Council Kurunegala respectively.

The learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge having inquired into

the matter had dismissed the said action on 16.01.2013. Matter was dismissed by the

learned Magistrate on the basis that the court has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the said

matter which falls within the purview of 4th schedule referred in sections 32 and 33 of the

Judicature Act as the 1st 4th Respondents are Police officers.

Being aggrieved by the said order, Informant Petitioner- Petitioner has invoked the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of North Western Province holden in

Kurunegala in case bearing No. HCR 18/2013. Following which, the learned High Court

Judge had held that the Magistrates Court / Primary Court has jurisdiction to hear and

determine the said matter and had sent the case back to the Magistrates Court of

Kurunegala to have the proceedings continued under Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act.

Thereafter, the case had proceeded before the learned Magistrate and after the conclusion

of the case, the learned Magistrate had delivered the order on 21.04.2015 dismissing the

impugned action on the ground that there was no breach of peace or a likelihood of such

to exercise jurisdiction under Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No.

44 of 1979.

Against the said order of the learned Magistrate, the Informant Petitioner has moved in

revision to the Provincial High Court of Kurunegala to have the said order dated

21.04.2015 set aside. The learned High Court Judge had held that there was a breach of

peace or breach of peace likely to be threatened and that the learned Magistrate/Primary

Court Judge had jurisdiction to proceed under Section 66 of the Act and had set aside the

said order dated 21.04.2015.

Being dissatisfied with the said order, the 1st 4th Respondent-Respondent-Appellants

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellants) had preferred this appeal seeking to

have the said order of the learned High Court Judge revised and the order of the learned

Magistrate dated 21.04.2015 affirmed.

Legal Issues

In this respect, this Court draws the attention to Judgment in case bearing No.CA (PHC)

161/98 [C.A.M 21.06.2010] where it was emphasized by Sisira De Abrew, J. that if the

learned Magistrate decided to issue notice on the Respondent on a private information filed

in terms of Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, it is obvious and

presumed that he does so after satisfying himself that there was a threat or a likelihood of

a breach of peace.

Page 5 of 6

Therefore, it can be concluded that learned Magistrate has jurisdiction to hear and

determine the instant case under Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

The rationale underlying the above is in view of section 114(d) of the Evidence Ordinance

which states Courts will have to presume that Judicial Acts have been regularly

performed. Therefore, the learned High Court Judge has been correct when he decided

by his order dated 30.11.2017 that the learned Magistrate has jurisdiction to hear and

determine the instant case. The learned High Court Judge further had ordered the learned

Primary Court Judge to inquire into the said case bearing No. 51274/L and to make an

appropriate order.

In such a situation, it is a duty of the learned Primary Court Judge who was holding the

inquiry to determine as to who was in possession of the land in dispute on the date on

which information was filed under Section 68(1) of the Act and make an order as to who

is entitled to possession of the land in dispute. Moreover, if the Primary Court Judge is

satisfied that any person who had been in possession of the disputed land has been

dispossessed within a period of two months immediately before the date on which the

information was filed, the learned Primary Court Judge may make a determination to that

effect and make an order directing the party dispossessed be restored to possession and

prohibit all disturbances of such possession otherwise than under the authority of an order

or decree of a competent Court.

In this instance, it is submitted that the intention of the Legislature in introducing Part VII

of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 is to prevent a breach of peace and

not to embark on a protracted trial. That is precisely the reason why, Section 67(1) of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act has given a three-month and one week period for a matter

to be concluded.

As the information in the instant action was filed on 19.11.2012 under the Section

66(1)(b) of the Act which is almost 10 years ago, we direct the learned Magistrate/Primary

Court Judge to decide the matter within a period of three months from the date of this

Judgment, based on available material such as affidavits, counter affidavits, annexed

documents, complaints, statements made by parties to the Police Station, written

submissions, and the order made by the Learned High Court judges.

The Registrar is directed to send the original case records of the Magistrates Court and the

High Court pertaining to this matter to the respective Courts.

The learned Magistrate/Primary Court Judge is hereby directed to deliver a fresh order for

the case bearing No. 51274/L on or before 30.06.2023 on the available evidence, in terms

of Section 68(1) or 68(3) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act as applicable.

In view of the aforementioned reasons, we dismiss the appeal of the 1st - 4th Respondent-

Respondent-Appellants with cost fixed at Rs. 50,000/-.
