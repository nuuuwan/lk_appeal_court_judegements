Appellant.

Wasantha Perera, DSG for the State.

Argued on: 07.03.2023

Decided on: 04.04.2023

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeal has been filed to set aside the judgment dated

12.1.2021 of the High Court of Panadura.

The accused appellant had been indicted under section 365 and two

charges of 345 of the Penal Code.

The appellant had pleaded not guilty and upon the conclusion of the trial

the learned High Court Judge had convicted the appellant for all three

charges and had sentenced to,

1) for the first charge 15 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine

and default sentence, 2) for the second charge 5 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine

and default sentence, 3) for the 3rd charge same as above, and the sentences for the

second and the third charge to run concurrently.

When the matter came up for argument the counsel for the appellant

indicated to Court that he is only canvassing the sentence.

As such the learned Counsel for the respondents had no objection for

the same.

Hence considering the submissions of both parties this court is of the

view that the sentence imposed by the learned trial judge should be

varied as below,

1) for the first charge a rigorous imprisonment of 10 years ordered

and the fine and the compensation to remain the same, the sentences with regard to the second and the third not varied but all three sentences to run concurrently and from the date of the conviction.

Subject to the above variation in the sentence the instant appeal is

dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
