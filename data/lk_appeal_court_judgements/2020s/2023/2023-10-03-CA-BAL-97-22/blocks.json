The 2nd suspect is Omalpage Dinesh Harsha Ranasinghe (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd suspect) in B 2192/21 in the Magistrates Court of Welisara. The 2nd suspect was arrested by the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) on 19.07.2021 while packing heroin in a house at Kotugoda, Ja-ela. He was alleged to have been in possession of 1.225 kilograms of heroin. The police also recovered Rs. 868,900/=, alleged to be the proceeds of heroin trafficking. According to the Government Analyst, the pure quantity of heroin is 809.6 grammes. The second suspect has been in remand custody since 19.07.2021. An application seeking for bail was filed in the High Court of Negombo, which was rejected by the Learned High Court Judge. Section 83 of the Poison, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, as amended by Act No. 41 of 2022, states; 83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under sections 54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.

In this case, the pure heroin detected was 809.6 grammes which is certainly a commercial quantity. Considering the gravity of the offence and the sentence prescribed under the Poison, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, there is a high risk of the suspect absconding, if he is enlarged on bail. In view of this, it is prudent to conclude the High Court case expeditiously while the suspect is in remand custody. The grounds urged by the petitioner, in this case, cannot be considered as exceptional circumstances. Further, the delay of more than two years in remand does not fall into the category of excessive and oppressive delay, considering the clarity of the offence and other circumstances of this case. Considering all the material placed before this Court, the petitioner has failed to satisfy that there are exceptional grounds to enlarge the suspect on bail.
