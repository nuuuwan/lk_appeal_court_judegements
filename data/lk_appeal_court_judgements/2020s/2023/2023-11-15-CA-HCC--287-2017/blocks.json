This was due to the fact that the deceased accused person Pradeep Nishantha had disappeared after being arrested by the police. Ironically the prosecution's stance was that the deceased accused Pradeep Nishantha was never arrested. He was presumed dead in view of the prevailing circumstances. But the accused-appellant claims that his cousin brother, the deceased accused Pradeep Nishantha was arrested by police and had subsequently disappeared. It was not disclosed from the accused how he came to know that the deceased accused was involved in a crime. The learned trail Judge had correctly determined the 3rd witness for the accused is a bias witness who was called to testify and to tarnish the credibility of PW 01.",
