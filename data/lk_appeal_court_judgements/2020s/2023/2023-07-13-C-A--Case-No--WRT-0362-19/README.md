WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The petitioner in this writ application is a Chartered Architect by

profession and also a cooperate member in the category of Associate of

the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects (SLIA). The petitioner stated that

the several arbitrary acts of the 1st to 21st respondents that resulted in

violation of law have adversely affected and prejudiced the democratic

and professional rights of the petitioner and the general public at large.

Accordingly, as a person who has a sufficient public interest with regard

to the issues pertaining to this application, the petitioner sought the

following reliefs from this Court.

Writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st to 21st

respondents to grant Cooperate Associate membership to the

22nd respondent of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects, which

decision is contained and disclosed in the documents marked as

P-9B and P-11.

Writ of mandamus directing the 1st to 22nd respondents to initiate

investigation in compliance with regulation 4.4 and the other

provisions of regulations marked as P-1 pertaining to the

complaint submitted by the petitioner marked as P-4.

Statements of objections have been filed on behalf of the 1st to 21st

respondents and on behalf of the 22nd respondent. The learned Counsel

for the petitioner, the learned counsel for the 1st to 21st respondents,

and the learned counsel for the 22nd respondents made oral

submissions at the hearing of this application.

Briefly, the facts relating to the application are as follows. On or about

29.01.2019, the petitioner observed that the name of the 22nd

Page 6 of 14

respondent displayed on the notice board of the 1st respondent as a

person to be admitted as an associate member of the 1st respondents

institute. The petitioner immediately submitted a complaint objecting

to the admission of the 22nd respondent as an associate member of the

1st respondent mainly on the ground of using the title Architect in

form 18 under the Companies Act (P-3) and thereby consented to

become a director and thereafter function as a member of the Board of

Directors of a company incorporated under the Companies Act in the

name and style of D.H Wijewardena Associates (Private) Limited in 2014

violating Section 12(4) of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects Law No.

1 of 1976 (as amended by Act No.14 of 1996). The basis of the

petitioners complaint was that when the 22nd respondent was a student

member of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects, she wrongfully used

the title Architect.

It transpires from the documents of the case that the 22nd respondent

was a student member from 2011 and from 2018, she was a graduate

member. On 15.08.2014, the 22nd respondent placed her signature to

the aforesaid form 18(P-3), mentioning her occupation as Architect.

The petitioner has received the letter dated 28th March 2019 (P-6) from

the 6th respondent stating that the complaint (P-4) of the petitioner had

been referred to the investigation committee as per the decision of the

council. Thereafter, the petitioner received a letter dated 20th May 2019

(P-8) signed by the 6th respondent stating that the council had decided

to refer the complaint of the petitioner to the legal consultant to get

clarification and after studying the documentation, the legal consultant

had informed that there was no material for further investigation and

the 22nd respondent had not violated the regulations of Sri Lanka

Institute of Architects. In the meantime, the petitioner stated that he

became aware of the Secretarys report presented to the 1st quarterly

general meeting of the 1st respondent held on 31st May 2019, in which,

it is stated that the 22nd respondent had been awarded the cooperate

Page 7 of 14

membership in the category of Associate. Subsequently, the petitioner

has received the letter dated 24th June 2019 (P-11) from the 6th

respondent stating that the matter had been considered and closed.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that there was no

investigation regarding the petitioners complaint and the same was not

considered according to Clause 4.4 of the Gazette Extraordinary

No. 2041/18 dated 2017 October 17 (P-1) and thus violated the

procedure laid down therein. Clause 4.4 of the said gazette deals with

the procedure in relation to Investigation of complaints prior to award

of membership. On the aforesaid ground of violating the stipulated

procedure, the petitioner seeks the writs prayed for in the petition.

In reply, the learned Counsel for the 22nd respondent contended that

the 22nd respondent has not violated section 12(4) of the Sri Lanka

Institute of Architects Law because there was no take or use of the

title Architect and the 22nd respondent merely referred Architect as

her occupation in the aforesaid form 18. Further, the learned Counsel

submitted that the 22nd respondent did not practice as an architect at

that time. Showing the documents such as P-4 and P-5, the learned

Counsel for the petitioner contended that in those documents the title

Architect has been used in front of the persons name and that this is

what is meant by Section 12(4) as using the title Architect. However,

the 22nd respondent, the learned Counsel submitted, has only

mentioned the word "Architect" as her occupation when filling out form

18 under the Companies Act for a need of her father's company. The

learned Counsel for the 22nd respondent contended further that the

Council of Sri Lanka Institute of Architects decided after an

investigation that the 22nd respondent had not violated the regulations

of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects.

Both the learned Counsel for the 22nd respondent and the learned

Counsel for the 1st to 21st respondents pointed out that as per clause

Page 8 of 14

4.2.1.1. of the aforesaid Gazette Extraordinary, objections must be

forwarded within one month from the date of displaying the name of the

applicant who applied to become associate member on the notice board

of the SLIA. Both the learned Counsel contended that the petitioner has

not objected within the prescribed one month and therefore, the

petitioners complaint should have been rejected even without

consideration.

First, I wish to consider what kind of reliefs have been prayed for by the

petitioner in this application. The petitioner seeks a writ of certiorari to

quash the decision contained in documents P-9B and P-11. P-9 is the

report of the secretary of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects. The place

where the 22nd respondent's name appears as a new associate member

has been marked as P-9B. Hence, P-9B is not a decision. P-11 is a letter

sent by the secretary of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects to the

petitioner stating that the council decision conveyed to you in our

previous letter dated 20th May 2019, the matter is considered closed.

At the hearing, the learned Counsel for the petitioner stated that the

decision that the petitioner sought to quash is the decision contained

in the document marked X-2 filed with the counter objections. So, the

petitioner is now seeking to quash a decision different from the decision

that he sought to quash by his petition.

The other relief prayed for in the petition is to grant a writ of mandamus

directing the 1st to 22nd respondent to initiate investigation in

compliance with regulation 4.4 and the other provisions of regulations.

Direction for an investigation is necessary only if a proper investigation

has not been conducted. This will be addressed later in this judgment.

Now, I proceed to consider the issue raised by the learned Counsel for

the 1st to 21st respondents and the learned Counsel for the 22nd

respondent that the petitioner had not objected within the period of one

Page 9 of 14

month as specified in clause 4.2.1.1. of the aforesaid gazette and thus

his objection must be rejected in limine. Undisputedly, as per the said

clause, objections have to be raised within one month from the date of

displaying the names of the applicants on the notice board of the SLIA.

The petitioners objections marked P-4 has been sent on 26.02.2019. In

the said letter of objections, it is stated SLIA- Part III- Final results

appeared on the SLIA notice board on 28.01.2019. As evident from the

document marked A-2, the 22nd respondents name has been displayed

on the notice board as an applicant for associate membership - SLIA on

30.04.2019. Therefore, it is apparent that the petitioner has forwarded

his objections within one month from the date of displaying the final

results and not within one month from displaying the name of the 22nd

respondent as an applicant. According to subsection 2 of Clause

4.2.1.1. if no objection is forwarded within the period of one month, the

council shall admit such applicant as an associate member of the

Institute. As it is apparent that the petitioner has not made his

objections within the stipulated period of one month, there was no

reason not to admit the 22nd respondent as an associate member and

there was no procedural violation.

The reply of the learned Counsel for the petitioner to the aforesaid

objection was that the one-month period is immaterial as the council

proceeded with the complaint/objection made by the petitioner.

Anyhow, I proceed to consider what steps have been taken by the SLIA

with regard to the objections raised by the petitioner. It appears that

the petitioner has made a similar complaint against the 22nd respondent

in 2017 as well. The said complaint is marked A-3. As evident from the

document marked X-1, the said complaint was rejected on the ground

that the petitioner had failed to respect and maintain confidentiality.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that when the

petitioner received the letter X-1 stating that his complaint is rejected,

Page 10 of 14

he got the impression that nothing happened to his complaint and it

was just rejected. However, referring to the document P-8, the learned

Counsel contended that the council has investigated the matters

relating to the said complaint and when the petitioner made the same

complaint in 2019, it has been informed by the letter P-8 that the

allegations have been already investigated and there is no material for

further investigation. He contended that subsequently, he received the

letter P-11 stating that the matter is considered closed.

The issue raised by the learned Counsel for the petitioner was that

informing the petitioner by X-1 that his 2017 complaint has been

rejected and thereafter, investigating the matter without the knowledge

of the petitioner is wrong. The procedure for disciplinary inquiries is

outlined in Clause 9 of the aforesaid gazette. According to Clause 9(1),

in the event of a breach of a regulation by a member, investigations

could be carried out on a complaint of anybody and even the council

itself or its standing committee can inquire into the matter. Hence, even

though the petitioner was informed that his complaint was rejected, the

council has the authority in investigating the matters disclosed from

the said complaint.

As per the documents marked A-6(a) to A-6(e), and A-7, a proper

investigation has been carried out by collecting necessary information.

Document A-8 is the report forwarded to the council after concluding

the investigation. According to the report, the conclusion of the

investigating committee was that there is no violation of the regulations

of SLIA by the 22nd respondent. Apart from the 22nd respondent, the

report refers to three others also and states further that there is no

merit in various allegations leveled against them in the letter by

architect Nalaka Jayaweera (the petitioner). Furthermore, it is

recommended by the said report to exonerate all four of them from all

allegations.

Page 11 of 14

The petitioners position was that he made a similar complaint in

2019.02.26 which is the subject matter of this application on the

impression that his first complaint was rejected without investigation.

That may be the reason for sending a similar complaint again. However,

what should be considered by this court is whether the allegations

made against the 22nd respondent have been properly investigated in

accordance with the specified investigation procedure. If the same

allegations have been investigated previously, there is no need to

investigate them again, when a similar complaint is received

subsequently. According to Section 8(4A)(b) of the Sri Lanka Institute

of Architects Law (as amended by Section 6 of the Act No 14 of 1996)

where an Investigating Committee appointed under paragraph (a) has

reported to the Council that a prima facie case has not been made out

against such member, Architect or Architectural Licentiate, as the case

may be, the Council shall not proceed further with the complaint.

When the investigating committee decided in 2017 that there was no

violation of regulations of SLIA by the 22nd respondent and there was

no merit in various allegations leveled by the petitioner, once again the

petitioner made a similar complaint against the 22nd respondent in

2019. So, the council referred the 2019 complaint to their legal

consultant and sent P-8 stating that the legal consultant has informed

that there is no material for further investigation and the status of

Ms. Shashini Wijewardena (22nd respondent) as referred in the complaint

has not violated the SLIA regulations. Once a complete investigation

had been carried out and found that the 22nd respondent has not

violated the regulations of SLIA, it is obvious that it is not necessary to

carry out another investigation for a similar complaint without any new

material. The only decision that the Council could take was to stop

proceeding with the 2019 complaint, under Section 8(4A)(b), as no

prima facie case has been made out. Hence, it is perfectly correct in

sending the letter P-11 stating that the matter is considered closed.

Page 12 of 14

The learned Counsel for the petitioner also complained that the decision

was not communicated to the petitioner. According to clause 4.4 of the

said gazette, the decision of the council shall be conveyed under

registered post to the relevant person against whom the complaint was

made and the complainant within two weeks from the date of the receipt

of the report by the council. P-11 is the decision of the council which

states that the matter was closed. The said decision is conveyed to the

petitioner and he has annexed the said documents with the petition.

However, according to clause 9.1(6) of the gazette, the investigating

committee shall submit a report containing the procedure adopted, its

findings, and other relevant information in the form of a written report

to the council in a confidential manner. All the necessary documents

and correspondence shall be annexed to the said report. Therefore, the

report prepared by the investigating committee containing its findings

and other relevant information is confidential and the petitioner is not

entitled to the same. The petitioner is entitled only to obtain the decision

of the council. The said decision has been conveyed to the petitioner as

stated previously. Therefore, the decision to close the matter pertaining

to the complaint made by the petitioner has been taken after following

the correct legal procedure and there is no violation of the procedure.

It is to be noted that in this writ application, this Court will not

reconsider whether the decision of the investigating committee and the

council that there was no violation of regulations is correct or not. In

A.I.V. Fernando v. W.D.L Perera, Controller of Immigration and

Emigration- C.A. Application No. 1115/98, decided on 04.08.2000, it

was held that when the court exercises writ jurisdiction, it does not

review the case on the merits. It only looks for the legality of the

decision.

Also, the Court of Appeal in Jefferjee v. Commissioner of Labour and

Others - (2008) 1 Sri L.R 12, following the case of Best Footwear (Pvt)

Page 13 of 14

Ltd., and Two Others v. Aboosally, Former Minister of Labour &

Vocational Training and Others - (1997) 2 Sri L.R 137 stated that

the remedy by way of certiorari cannot be made use of to correct errors

or to substitute a correct order for a wrong order. Judicial review is

radically different from appeals, when hearing an appeal, the Court is

concerned with the merits of the decision under appeal. In appeal, the

appellate Court can modify, alter, substitute or rescind the order or

decision under appeal. (Vide Article 138 of the Constitution that gives

the forum jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal for the correction of all

errors in fact, or in law, committed by Courts of first instance, tribunal

or other institution.) In Judicial review, the Court is concerned with its

legality and cannot vary, modify, alter or substitute the order under

review. On appeal, the question is right or wrong, on review, the

question is lawful or unlawful. Instead of substituting its own decision

for that of some other body as happens when an appeal is allowed, a

Court on review is concerned only with the question whether the act or

order under attack should be allowed to stand or not.

In the case at hand, no illegality has been occurred in arriving at the

decision that there was no violation of the regulations of SLIA by the

22nd respondent. Also, the decision has been taken within the

jurisdiction of the Council of Sri Lanka Institute of Architects after

adopting the correct investigation procedure. Therefore, I hold that the

aforesaid circumstances do not warrant exercising the writ jurisdiction

of this court.

Before concluding, it is worth to be noted that according to the report

of the investigation committee marked A-8, the committee found no

evidence to prove that the D.H Wijewardena Associate (Pvt) Ltd had

engaged in providing architectural services (page 8 of the report)

although the key issue raised by the petitioner was that the said

company has engaged in providing professional services relation to

architecture. In addition, the investigating committee found that

Page 14 of 14

D.H Wijewardena Associate (Pvt) Ltd is not an entity registered with

the SLIA and thus the said company does not come under the

definition of practice under the SLIA, therefore regulations are directly

not applicable to the said company (page 9 of the report). Therefore, it

appears that the investigating committee concluded that the 22nd

respondent did not violate SLIA regulations after considering all

relevant factors.

For the foregoing reasons, the application for writs prayed for in the

petition is dismissed subject to costs of Rs.50,000/-.

Application dismissed.
