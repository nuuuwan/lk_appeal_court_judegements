JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter after referred as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General before the High Court of

Colombo under Sections 54(A) (b) and 54(A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for

Possession and Trafficking respectively of 25.34 grams of Heroin on 09th July

2013.

After the trial the Appellant was found guilty only for 2nd count and the

Learned High Court Judge of Colombo has imposed life imprisonment on 2nd

count on 13th of December, 2017. Further, the money which had been

recovered at the time of his arrest was ordered to be confiscated by the State.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to Covid 19

pandemic restrictions.

On behalf of the Appellant following Grounds of Appeal were raised.

1. That there is a discrepancy in the weight of Heroin recovered

from the Appellant and the Government Analyst Report.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the

contradictions and improbabilities of the prosecution case.

3. That the Learned High Court Judge has cast burden on the

Appellant.

According to PW1, IP/Chandana, attached to Police Station Maligawatta, he

carried out a series of raid at Mahawatta located within the local limits of

Grandpass Police Station on an information received from their informants

relating to drug related activities. Among the information, the arrest of the

Appellant was a specific one received by the IP/Chandana. Nine police

officers took part in the operation.

As the first raid which was carried out at 9.00 hours did not yield any results,

the team had proceeded and had come to Ingurukade Junction and

proceeded to Mahawatta area on foot. IP/Chandana and SI Majula had

taken the lead.

According to PW1, Sugath seeing their approach a person who behaved in a

suspicious manner and who tried to leave the place was caught by the PW2

SI/Manjula. The Appellant was taken into his house and searched by PW2.

Upon the search his body, a pink coloured parcel was found underneath his

underwear in which they found separate parcels which contained small 600

packets which they suspected to containing Heroin (Diacetylmorphine).

Further, a search was conducted near the residence of the Appellant and the

police party had found cash amounting to Rs.214410/- packed in a tulip bag

hidden under a pottery shack just outside the Appellants house. The

Appellants identity was only revealed after his arrest, even though the police

had received a specific information about the Appellant.

The recovered contraband was temporarily sealed using an envelope.

Thereafter, it was taken to the van along with the Appellant under the

custody of PC 74428 Isuru and under the supervision of PC 74385 Sunil.

Thereafter, the police party had conducted series of raids and arrested

multiple suspects with substance suspected to be Heroin. According to

police, all necessary precaution had been taken to prevent any mixing up of

substances.

Finally, the Appellant, all other suspects and the productions recovered from

them were taken to a pawning centre named Sew Gunasekera to weigh the

productions. The substances recovered from the Appellant weighed about 80

grams. Thereafter, all suspects including the Appellant and the recoveries

were handed over to the police reserve PC 52047 at Maligawatta Police

Station.

The parcel pertaining to the Appellant had been registered under production

No. 13/2013 and was produced to Maligakanda Magistrate Court with the

Appellant. Productions had been kept in the police station under different

reserve duty officers before being taken to Magistrate Court, Maligakanda.

After obtaining court order, the productions had been handed over to

Government Analyst Department on 08/08/2013.

The prosecution led 04 witnesses excluding the Government Analyst, marked

productions and closed the case. The Government Analyst Report was

admitted under Section 420 of Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Thereafter,

the defence was called and the Appellant made a dock statement and closed

the case.

In his dock statement, the Appellant took up the position that he was never

in possessed any dangerous drugs as claimed by the prosecution. In his

contention the drugs were introduced to him by the 1st and 2nd witnesses.

When he refused and agitated, he had stated that he was assaulted by the

PW1 and PW2.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person. In the case of this

nature, the prosecution not only need to prove the case beyond reasonable

doubt but also ensure, with cogent evidence that the inward journey of the

production has not been disturbed at the all-material points.

CA-HCC 0468/2017

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable

doubt. Although we take serious view in regard to offences

relation to drugs, we are of the view that the prosecutor

should not be given a second chance to fill the gaps of badly

handled prosecutions where the identity of the good

analysis for examination has to be proved beyond

reasonable doubt. A prosecutor should take pains to ensure

that the chain of events pertaining to the productions that

had been taken charge from the Appellant from the time it

was taken into custody to the time it reaches the

Government Analyst and comes back to the court should be

established.

In the first ground of appeal, the Appellant takes up the position that there

is a discrepancy in the weight of Heroin recovered from the Appellant and

the Government Analyst Report. The Counsel for the Appellant contends that

the Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself by failing to analyse the weight

discrepancy which disturbs the production chain. Further submits that this

is a substantial fact, the prosecution will have to prove beyond reasonable

doubt.

Although, the Government Analyst Report was marked as an admission

under Section 420 of the CPC, as pointed out by the Counsel for Appellant,

the defence has only admitted the contents of the report but not the chain of

the production. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

According to chief investigation officer IP Chandana, the substance found in

the possession of the Appellant was weighed using an electronic scale used

in the pawning centre. He had chosen this option considering that the

weighing machines used in the pawning centre were registered and accurate.

CA-HCC 0468/2017

In the parcel recovered from the Appellant weighed about 80 grams of

substance.

However, when the productions were taken to the Government Analyst

Department, a notable difference had been noted in the parcel. According to

the Government Analyst Report which had been marked as P27 in the High

Court Trial, the weight of parcel mentioned as 85.43 grams. This is 5.43

grams in excess to the original weight. Hence the Appellant argues that the

weight difference creates a serious doubt in the prosecution case.

In Faiza Hanoon Yoosuf v Attorney General CA/121/2002 it was held

that:

In effect the first ground of appeal is that the prosecution

failed to establish the nexus between the Heroin detected

and what was produced in court. In court, the prosecution

must prove the chain of custody. This must be done by

establishing the nexus between the heroin detected and

what was handed over to the Government Analyst for

examination and report. The prosecution must prove that,

what was subjected to analysis is exactly the same

substance that was detected in that particular case. In this

regard the inward journey of the production plays a

dominant role and is most significant.

In Perera V. Attorney General [1998] 1 Sri.L.R it was held:

the most important journey is the inward journey because

the final analyst report will depend on that.

CA-HCC 0468/2017

When this Court invited the Respondent to explain regarding weight

discrepancy transpired from the evidence, the Senior Deputy Solicitor

General following the best traditions and highest standard admitted the

weight discrepancy in the production and further added that he is unable to

explain the reason.

In this regard, the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment had made

general comments about weight discrepancies in cases of this nature. In

absence of the evidence led regarding this particular point; the comment

made by the Learned High Court has no doubt caused great prejudice to a

fair trial. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

This situation has further aggravated by failure to call the Government

Analyst to give evidence. Hence, no doubt, this has created a very serious

doubt on the prosecution case.

In the Second ground of appeal, the Counsel contends that the Learned High

Court Judge has failed to evaluate the contradictions and improbabilities of

the prosecution case.

According to the evidence given by PW1 and PW2, after the arrest of the

Appellant, six more arrests had been done and recovered Heroin. Hence, it

is utmost importance that the productions recovered are handed over

without being mixed up.

CA-HCC 0468/2017

According to the prosecution, the Appellant was the first to get arrested on

09.07.2013. He was arrested at 10.45 am. Thereafter, PW1 temporary sealed

the Heroin purportedly recovered from the Appellant in a long envelope where

he claimed that he mentioned the Appellants name on the cover, which was

then dated, signed and sealed by him. The reason behind this precautionary

step is clear as many more arrest and recoveries were expected on that day.

The relevant portion of evidence given by PW1 is re-produced below:

Page 72 of the brief.

But it was later revealed that no such precautionary measures were adopted

by PW1 according to the testimony of PW5 PC 74428 Isuru. According to

him, no such descriptions were to be found on the temporary sealed envelope

apart from the two seals which was marked by the prosecution.

The relevant portion of evidence of PW5 ids re-produced below:

This clearly shows that PW1 was handling the substances recovered from

the Appellant and other suspects arrested in a dangerous and unsafe

manner. This position of the Appellant clearly supports the weight

discrepancy in the substance recovered from the Appellant and sent to the

Government Analyst Department for analysis. Hence, this ground also has

merit.

In the final ground, the Appellant contends that that the Learned High Court

Judge has cast additional burden on the Appellant.

In a criminal trial, it is incumbent on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt. There is no burden on the Appellant to prove his

innocence. This is the Golden Thread as discussed in Woolmington v. DPP

[1935] A.C.462. In this case Viscount Sankey J held that:

CA-HCC 0468/2017

11 | P a g e

Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is

always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the

prisoners guilt If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there

is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the

prosecution or the prisoner..the prosecution has not made out the case

and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.

The Learned Trial Judge in his judgment at pages 281-282 (51st paragraph)

had stated as follows:

Pages 281-282 of the brief.

The above quoted portion of the judgment is clear indication that the Learned

High Court Judge had reversed the burden of proof on the Appellant, which

is unknown to the criminal prosecution. Hence, this ground also has merit.

The evidence placed by the prosecution with regard to inward journey creates

a serious doubt on the conviction against the Appellant. Further, the

evidence given by prosecution witnesses consists of contradictions and

improbabilities. Reversing the burden on the defence has denied a fair trial

to the Appellant.

Considering all three appeal grounds, it certainly affects the root of the case.

Therefore, we set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by Learned High

CA-HCC 0468/2017

12 | P a g e

Court Judge of Colombo dated 13/12/2017 on the Appellant. Therefore, he

is acquitted from the 2nd charge.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
