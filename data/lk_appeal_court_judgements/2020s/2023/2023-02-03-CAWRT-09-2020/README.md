The present application, which is the result of a prolonged legal battle stemming

from the ineptitude of the State officials concerned, is a complete waste of time and

resources and serves as an example of the type of conduct that cannot be tolerated; it is

not the conduct of diligent, conscientious State officials, entrusted with powers and

functions in the expectation that they would exercise those powers and functions

diligently and conscientiously. The Respondent authorities have also displayed

contemptuous conduct by their utter disregard for Court orders. This contemptible and

frankly appalling conduct will be elaborated on in the course of this judgment.

The Petitioners who are siblings, are before this Court seeking, inter alia, a Writ

of Mandamus to compel the 6th Respondent (the District Secretary, Hambantota) to rectify

the error in the permit (bearing No. 17343 dated 29th June 1949 - X2) issued to their late

father, namely one Kadimachcharige Jandiris (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

permit holder) under the Land Development Ordinance No. 19 of 1935, as amended. This

error was discovered only when a commission was re-issued by the District Court in 2018,

more than seventy years after the permit was issued, to determine the quantum of

compensation payable to the 1st to 4th Respondents for the developments they had done

on that land. The error is that the particular Lot number referred to in the permit (Lot 38

in Final Village Plan No. 636) is in fact a roadway and not the allotment of land that was

alienated to the Petitioners father. A mistake that managed to stay hidden over the years,

despite, as explained below, the land having been assessed on a commission issued by

Court prior to its re-issuance in 2018. The Petitioners made this application to compel the

relevant Respondent authorities to rectify this error in the permit by identifying the

actual land referred to in the Schedule of the permit, with its definitive boundaries, and

to compel the registration of the 1st Petitioner (eldest son of the permit holder) as successor

to that land, under his late fathers permit.

The background of this application in its chronological order, as narrated in the

Petition, is as follows.

A dispute involving the Petitioners father, the 1st Respondent, and three others

resulted in the Police instituting an action in the Magistrates Court of Tissamaharama

in 1980 (Cases bearing No. 518 and 519). At the behest of the learned Magistrate, the

parties agreed to a settlement whereby the 1st Respondent was entitled to occupy the land

(the corpus alienated under the permit) for a period of two and a half years, to set off a

debt of Rs. 4000/- the Petitioners father owed the 1st Respondent. The 1st Respondent

Page 5 of 16

agreed to hand over vacant possession of that land to the Petitioners father at the

expiration of that period (These conditions are found in the Order of the learned

Magistrate dated 2nd December 1980 - P1a). The 1st Respondent at the end of that period

went back on his word. He had permitted the 2nd and 3rd Respondents to occupy the land

too. The Petitioners father (the permit holder) passed away on 7th April 1986. The

Petitioners claim that it is the eldest son (the 1st Petitioner) who is entitled to succeed to

the land and that they took steps to have him administratively declared/ recognised as

the successor, after the demise of their father.

The Government Agent of Hambantota (as they were then referred to) instituted

two actions in the Magistrates Court of Tissamaharama under the provisions of the State

Land (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979, as amended, to evict the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents (Cases bearing No. 1699 and 1698, respectively). As the Journal Entry

(dated 11th January 1991- on page 170 of the Brief) shows, it was admitted that the 2nd

Respondent, who was present in Court on that day, did not occupy the land on any valid

written authority. The learned Magistrate ordered their eviction (

. - vide page 170 of the Brief). Aggrieved by these Orders for eviction,

the 2nd and 3rd Respondents each filed a revision application in the High Court of Matara

(Cases bearing No. 28/1991 and 51/1991, respectively). The High Court saw no merit to

their applications because the Respondents did not possess any valid permit or written

authority to possess the land and rejected the same by Orders P4b and P4a dated 4th

March 1994 (vide pages 173 and 174 of the Brief).

It must be stated that no steps were taken by the relevant competent authority

(the Government Agent of Hambantota now the Divisional Secretary) to recover that

land from the Respondents. This failure to abide by the Court Order is contemptuous

conduct. There is no reason forthcoming for such failure. This behaviour is surprising to

see because when compared with the other writ applications we have had before us, the

competent authority has been swift in evicting unlawful possessors of state land.

Sometimes too quickly that they fail to properly formulate the all-important opinion in

terms of Section 3 of that Act, before instituting the action in the Magistrates Court.

The 5th to 10th Respondent authorities in their Statement of Objections assert that

the action was instituted under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act to secure

and recover state land from unlawful occupation (vide paragraph 10). In the face of their

failure to recover the land from the 2nd and 3rd Respondents, who continued to possess the

land despite the Court orders, the strong assertions of the absolute ownership of the

Page 6 of 16

State made in the Statement of Objections of the 5th to 10th Respondent authorities

become empty or toothless.

Thereafter, the Petitioners received a notice (in terms of Section 106 of the Land

Development Ordinance -dated 30th June 1999 - P5) from the Divisional Secretary,

Tissamaharama to show cause why the permit should not be cancelled. An order

cancelling the permit (P6) was issued on 15th November 1999, subject to an appeal to

the Commissioner General of Lands (as provided for in the Ordinance). This cancellation

was on the basis that the Petitioners father had breached the terms of the permit. The

order of cancellation was appealed to the Commissioner General of Lands. The Land

Commissioner of the Southern Province by letter dated 25th May 2000 (P7) to the

Divisional Secretary, Tissamaharama (copied to, among others, the 2nd Petitioner and the

3rd Respondent) suspended the Divisional Secretarys Order cancelling the permit and

instructed him to inform those seeking to succeed to the land, under Schedule 3 of the

Ordinance, to commence judicial proceedings, within three months from the date of

issuance of the said letter, to determine the lawful successor to that land as no consensus

could be reached on the matter. This letter (P7) titled

- . . 17343 reads:

The powers of the Commissioner acting as an appellate forum are set out in Section

115 of the Ordinance. The Commissioner has the power to, inter alia, direct further

inquiry to be made or information to be furnished or evidence to be given, set aside, modify

the order of the Divisional Secretary, or make an order that he considers just.

Page 7 of 16

We observe that in the aforesaid letter the Land Commissioner has opted to

conveniently pass the buck to the Courts to determine the entitlement to succeed when

the Land Development Ordinance amply makes provision for the Divisional Secretary,

who would have the benefit being possessed of all the relevant information to make that

decision and the ability to conduct an exhaustive inquiry and to resolve the same. This is

distinct from challenging the correctness or the legality, in relevant judicial proceedings,

of a decision that has been made by the Divisional Secretary, or the relevant

administrative authority. The proposed course of action would mean that there would not

be an initial administrative decision that is then challenged judicially, instead, the

judiciary would have to make that initial administrative decision. This is the course of

action that the Commissioner had opted to take. We are of the view that to let the judiciary

make that initial decision is an abdication of their statutory functions.

This decision made out of convenience triggered lengthy contentious litigation

which could have been avoided altogether. To put it in context, the Land Commissioner

decided in the year 2000 to instruct the parties to commence litigation to determine the

issue of succession (a matter which, as stressed above, could have been resolved by the

respective administrative officers themselves) which then commenced in the year 2000

and has since made its way up to the Supreme Court, back to the District Court, and now

before us. Whether this litigation will finally come to an end with this judgment in the

year 2023 is yet to be seen. The cost in terms of time, money, and other resources to battle

it out, a cost which has to be borne by those financially unsound, is monumental. An

inconsiderate decision, which represents an abdication of power. The material made

available to us, which was undoubtedly available to the Divisional Secretary and the Land

Commissioner, appears to point to the fact that there is no controversy as to succession.

The relevant Court records aptly demonstrate that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents are

unauthorised possessors of that allotment of land. There is no contention of such nature

about whether the children of the permit holder are in fact his children or not. If it was

contested, then it would require judicial determination. The provisions of the Ordinance

clearly set out the line of succession, in the absence of nomination or in the failure of the

nominee to succeed to the land.

We observed that in the permit (X2) there appears to be one Podisina (daughter

of the permit holder) who has been nominated as successor. However, the relevant

administrative officers would be better capable of ascertaining whether, in fact, she failed

to succeed to the said land within the six months statutory time limit or not, because this

Page 8 of 16

material is not before us. If she failed to do so, she would lose her entitlement to succeed

as per Section 68 read together with Sections 84 and 85 of the Ordinance and succession

will be determined as per the Third Schedule.

The decision evinced in P7 is also erroneous because it recommends a report to

be submitted to him to decide if to regularize possession of those actually possessing the

land i.e. the 2nd and 3rd Respondents. That is to regularize persons who have been

judicially recognised as unauthorised possessors of that land. An absurd decision to say

the least.

We would like to note that, if the Land Commissioner concerned had been made a

party to this application by name we would have unhesitatingly ordered costs to be borne

by him, as one wrong decision has led to immense hardship and inconvenience.

Instructing to commence judicial proceedings, for what was purely an administrative

matter that could have been resolved in a matter of months, has now taken more than

twenty years to come to an end.

As instructed, the Petitioners filed, by Plaint dated 31st August 2000 (P8), an

action in the Tissamaharama District Court (Case bearing No. 144/2000/L) against the 1st

to 4th Respondents, the Divisional Secretary, Tissamaharama (the 5th Respondent) and

the Land Commissioner of the Southern Province (the 7th Respondent). The Plaint which

sets out the entire story notes that the Respondents had since 1979 periodically carried

out developments on the land. The Petitioners sought a declaration that the 1st to 4th

Respondents had no proprietary rights to that land and a declaration that it is the

Petitioners who are entitled to succeed to the land as children of the deceased permit

holder.

The 1st to 4th Respondents, in their Answer dated 29th March 2001 (P9), state,

among other things, that the plot of land on which they reside (in the extent of acre) is

one-half of the disputed land, which was sold by the Petitioners father (the permit holder)

to one W.P. Saranelis, the father-in-law of the 2nd Respondent, on the 30th of May 1973 for

a consideration of Rs. 650/-, who in turn gifted it to the 2nd Respondent as dowry in 1979.

Subsequently, they constructed a house on that land, with no objection from the permit

holder. Further, the other half of the land (in the extent of acre) was purchased by the

1st Respondent from the permit holder in 1974 and thereafter the 1st Respondent handed

it over to his siblings, the 3rd and 4th Respondents, who developed it. It is also claimed

that the Petitioners do not have locus standi to institute the action as their father had

Page 9 of 16

breached the conditions of the permit, which was then cancelled as a result. A claim in

reconvention was made for compensation in sums of Rs. 600,000/-, Rs. 450,000/-, and Rs.

500,000/- respectively to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Respondents for the improvements they made

on the respective parts of the land.

The 5th and 7th Respondents (the Divisional Secretary and the Provincial Land

Commissioner), on whose instructions the action was instituted, in their Answer (P10

on page 466 of the Brief) claimed that they had been misjoined. They were subsequently

discharged from the proceedings. The trial proceeded with five admissions (one of which

was the land), sixteen and ten issues raised respectively on behalf of the Petitioners and

the 1st to 4th Respondents (Pages 257 to 263 of the Brief). Both parties led evidence. The

learned District Judge by judgment dated 23rd July 2009 (P20) held that the

Respondents were sold their respective parts of the land by the permit holder, who had

done so in breach of the terms of the permit; the permit had not been cancelled as it was

suspended on appeal; the 1st Petitioner was entitled to succeed to the land as the firstborn

son of the permit holder; the Respondents were entitled to compensation for the bona fide

improvements and until such compensation was paid the Respondents were entitled to

remain on their respective parts of the land. As observed by the learned District Judge

(on page 461 of the Brief):

.

The amount of compensation payable was determined to be Rs. 655,000/- to the 2nd

Respondent and Rs. 800,000/- to the 4th Respondent. The quantum was determined based

on an aggregate of the amount determined in the assessment report (4V1 on page 186

of the Brief) issued by a Valuer attached to the Valuation Department (Southern Region)

dated 2nd November 2005 (Rs. 455,000/- to the 2nd Respondent and Rs.600,000/- to the 4th

Respondent), based on a commission issued by Court, and an addition of Rs. 200,000/-

included by the learned District Judge to reflect the depreciation of the rupee (from the

year 2005 when the assessment was done to the year 2009 when the judgment was

delivered - vide pages 28-30 of the judgment of the learned District Judge Pages 459 to

461 of the Brief).

Aggrieved by the said judgment, the 2nd and 4th Respondents preferred an appeal

to the High Court of Civil Appeals holden in Tangalle (Case bearing No.

Page 10 of 16

SP/HCCA/TA/41/2009F) to set aside the judgment of the learned District Judge. However,

this appeal was dismissed because the 2nd and 4th Respondents agreed to abide by the

decision in the appeal, which was filed by the Petitioners, and for both appeals to be heard

together. The Petitioners filed an appeal (Case bearing No. SP/HCCA/TA/40/2009F)

against the judgment of the learned District Judge to vary or amend the amount of

compensation payable by them. The appeal was, as stated in the judgment of the High

Court of Civil Appeals, primarily based on the amount of compensation that was ordered

to be payable. It was found that the assessment report was made on a commission that

required the improvements to be assessed at the market value at the time (2005).

Nonetheless, the High Court of Civil Appeals, by its judgment dated 2nd March 2017

(P27 on page 591 of the Brief), held that the assessment must be computed at the date

the action was instituted, which meant that the order relating to the amount of

compensation, and the additions of Rs. 200,000/- each made thereto by the learned District

Judge was erroneous. It was ordered that a fresh commission be issued to the Valuation

Department, and for the assessment to be computed at the market value in the year 2000.

The relevant part of the judgment (on page 593 of the Brief) reads:

.

The 2nd Respondent appealed to the Supreme Court against this judgment on the

basis that the said judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeals is contrary to law and

against the weight of evidence; that the learned Judges had misdirected themselves in

holding that the 1st Petitioner can be nominated as the successor of the permit holder and

that the learned Judges misdirected themselves in the assessment of compensation (as

per the Petition of Appeal of the 2nd Respondent dated 6th April 2017- P29). On 4th July

2017, the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal (P30 on page 599 of the Brief).

The original case record arrived back at the District Court of Tissamaharama. A

commission was issued to the Government Valuer, Valuation Department of the Southern

Province on 19th July 2018 to obtain a valuation in relation to the market value for the

year 2000 of the building and plantations on the land, on the direction of the High Court

Page 11 of 16

of Civil Appeals (P33a on page 618 of the Brief). All parties were informed to be present

at the land on the 4th of December 2018.

The Petitioners claim that to their surprise the 2nd and 4th Respondents moved

Court to make a special application (P34 17th January 2019). It was brought to the

notice of the Court that when the officer of the Valuation Department visited the land to

execute the commission it was discovered that the allotment of land, viz. Lot 38 in the

Final Village Plan No. 636, alienated under the permit issued to the permit holder is a

roadway, and the Respondents are in possession of Lot 37B in the Final Village Plan No.

636. The Respondents prayed for a declaration that the buildings constructed by them do

not fall within the scheduled property and to declare that the judgment was based on an

error. A letter dated 28th January 2019 issued by one S.M. Abeywickrama, District Valuer,

Valuation Department (Southern Provincial Office -II) to the Registrar of the District

Court of Tissamaharama notes that Lot 38 is a road (P36).

The Petitioners contention is that despite this error, which must surely be a

clerical error, the Schedule in the Plaint has definitive boundaries with an identifiable

extent, and the learned District Judge has not referred to the Lot number but instead

referred to the scheduled property itself. It is also averred that at the trial the land was

admitted. The Petitioners had written to the 7th Respondent, copying the 5th and 6th

Respondents to inquire into this matter and rectify the error. The 7th Respondent had

referred the matter to the 5th Respondent for an examination to be conducted and a report

to be submitted thereon (P42 dated 7th May 2019). The 5th Respondent in response to

that letter noted that the 9th Respondent (the District Valuer, Valuation Department) had

informed him that Lot 38 is a road, and therefore no valuation could be provided (P45

dated 6th December 2019).

Therefore, the Petitioners are at present before this Court seeking a Writ of

Mandamus to compel the 6th Respondent to rectify this error on the permit; a Writ of

Mandamus to compel the 6th Respondent through the 10th Respondent to demarcate the

boundaries of the land by reference to the metes and bounds of the scheduled property; a

Writ of Mandamus compelling the 5th, 6th, 7th Respondents, or any one of them, to name

the 1st Petitioner as successor to the land of the original permit holder; a Writ of

Prohibition to prevent the 1st to 4th Respondents from taking steps to apply for a permit

for Lot 37B.

On a perusal of the Schedule found in the Quit Notice as depicted in the Journal

Entries (on pages 153, and 164 of the Brief) of the action instituted against the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, and the Schedule found

in the Plaint by which the Petitioners instituted the action in the District Court, on the

instructions of the Land Commissioner, are the same. Both Schedules, respectively, are

as follows:

...

636 38 (01)

:

: ...

:

: .

, , , ,

, .. 17343 , ... 636 38

, : , : . . . , : ,

: (: 01, ) .

The land as described in the permit (X2) is also referred to as Lot 38 in Final

Village Plan No. 636, in an extent of one acre. It is worth noting that this permit does not

provide a detailed schedule, with definitive boundaries. Rather it only provides the

information set out in this paragraph. If this is the case, then the competent authority

could not have relied on the Schedule in the permit as there is no Schedule. A question

then arises of how, specifically, based on what material, the competent authority drafted

the aforesaid Schedule. The Court can presume that the Schedule indicated in the record

of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act proceedings would have been a description

of the land issued under the permit.

It would be unfair for the Petitioners to be faulted for this error at this juncture,

after all these years, and contentious legal battles, as they appear to rely on the

description of the land referred in those instruments prepared by the respective

Respondent authorities. As mentioned in the commencement of this judgment, the fault

lies squarely with the Respondent authorities. It would be wanting in common sense to

Page 13 of 16

expect ordinary lay persons to whom land has been alienated to undertake surveys, as

that is an onus falling on the issuing authorities. It is for this reason that the statement

found in paragraph 22 of the Statement of Objections of the 5th to 10th Respondents which

seems to cast such a burden on the litigant and unfairly find fault with such litigant is

unacceptable. The suggestion that it is the Petitioners fault for waiting seventy-plus

years since the issuance of the permit to lodge this application is abhorrent. The

statement verbatim reads:

.. and that the application of the Petitioner before Your Lordships Court has been filed after 70

after issue of permit and 34 years of the Petitioner seeking succession thereto and after several

rounds of litigation purportedly to settle private interests thereon, to ascertain the correctness of

the corpus/state land as identified in the permit which has been issued, is both frivolous and futile,

and the Petitioner is moreover guilty of lashes without any conceivable justification for the

unexplained and inordinate delay in seeking a remedy in writ.

This statement is in complete ignorance of the fact that the description of the land

found in the respective Schedule was, as quoted above, drafted by the State Officials

themselves; the Schedule as found in the action instituted in terms of the State Land

(Recovery of Possession) Act against the 2nd and 3rd Respondents, unauthorised occupants.

The Petitioners in filing their Plaint have relied on the Schedules prepared by the relevant

State Officials.

It must also be noted that the Land Development Ordinance as originally

conceived did not contain a provision for a survey of the land to be undertaken prior to its

alienation under a permit. It was only by an amendment in the year 1981 (by Amendment

Act No. 27 of 1981) that the Legislature insisted on a survey to be carried out prior to

lands being alienated on permits. This Section (Section 19(3)) provides that additionally,

the Government Agent shall cause the land alienated on such a permit to be surveyed by

the Surveyor-General, and the extent and description (by reference to metes and bounds)

of the land so surveyed shall be inserted in such permit.

It is therefore conceivable that such a provision would have been included because

there would have been many issues, similar to the error found in the present application,

relating to the lands originally alienated, i.e., lands alienated at a time when such surveys

were not insisted. Therefore, it is inconceivable to now place the entire blame on the

permit holder, a beneficiary under this Ordinance in 1949, entitled to this land on the

ground that he belonged to an economically disadvantaged group.

Page 14 of 16

It appears that the Legislature, in its wisdom, recognizing human fallibility, has

made provisions for the correction or rectification of flawed instruments issued under the

Ordinance. In terms of Section 20 of the State Lands Ordinance:

Where it appears to a prescribed officer that any instrument of disposition (whether

executed before or after the commencement of this Ordinance) contains any clerical or other error

or requires amendment in respect of the description of the land comprised therein or in respect of

the inscription or recital of the name or designation of the grantee or of any other material fact,

such error may be rectified or such amendment may be made by an indorsement on such

instrument of disposition signed by such prescribed officer and the grantee; and any indorsement

so signed shall be sufficient for all purposes to rectify the error or to effect the amendment; and the

instrument on which any such indorsement is made shall have effect as though it had been

originally issued or executed as so rectified or amended. [emphasis added]

A request has been made by the Petitioners to the Land Commissioner (P41) to

do so. The Statement of Objections does not address this.

It must be noted that the permit has not yet been cancelled. Therefore, the

Respondent authorities can act in terms of Section 19(3) of the Land Development

Ordinance, in causing a survey of the respective lands to be undertaken, along with

Section 20 of the State Lands Ordinance to rectify their mistake.

Therefore, on a review of the entire history of this case, it appears that the present

trouble arises from the original sin which is the absence of a description of the allotment

of land, with reference to its boundaries, alienated under the permit. Second, when Courts

have ordered the eviction of unlawful, unauthorised occupiers of land, that has not been

carried out. Third, the Land Commissioners abdication of responsibility by passing the

buck to the courts, when that matter could have been resolved administratively. Fourth,

the failure of the relevant Respondent authorities to take steps to rectify the error in the

permit issued by them.

The argument that the permit holder was not issued an allotment of land, but a

road, is illogical. This is because permits are issued, and it can be judicially presumed in

this case to have been issued, at a Land Kachcheri in which the selection is made as to

which person is entitled to the allotment. To be eligible to participate at such Kachcheri

the candidates should have occupied or claim to occupy the land. It would be illogical for

them to occupy or claim occupation of a road. Further, it is the Respondent authorities

who prepared the Schedules to eject the Respondents under the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act, and also sought to cancel the permit on the ground that the permit holder

Page 15 of 16

had breached the conditions it was issued under. There would not have been any need for

cancellation if the land alienated is actually a road.

It is also astounding how this error of an incorrect Lot was not discovered before.

Firstly, when the competent authority formulated an opinion that the land is state land

this should have surfaced. It clearly shows that the competent authority has been

haphazard in forming that opinion. Moreover, this error should have been discovered

when the District Court issued a commission for the first time to have the improvements

on the land to be assessed. An inspection surely would have been carried out in order for

the initial valuer to determine the quantum of compensation as he did. If not doubts arise

about his report, such as whose land he was actually valuing, whether he in fact referred

to the Schedule and whether the figures that he presented were accurate.

At the argument stage when we asked the learned Counsel for the 5th to 10th

Respondents what authority the Respondent authorities had to require a judicial solution

to determine succession, it is deplorable to note that the answer was that they were not

concerned with the outcome of the court ruling. Meaning that although Court has made a

finding that the 1st Petitioner is entitled to succeed, they are not bound by such a finding.

Rather startling remarks from an officer of the Court. To add further, when learned State

Counsel appears in that capacity, on behalf of the State, there is a duty to advice the

relevant State authorities concerned instead of adopting a win-at-any-cost approach and

trying to justify and defend absurd decisions of the relevant authorities.

Accordingly, in the hope of finally bringing an end to this matter, we grant the

relief prayed for. The Divisional Secretary and the Land Commissioner are ordered to act

through the Surveyor General of Lands (10th Respondent) and cause a survey of those

allotments of land to be done. Following which, the Divisional Secretary and Land

Commissioner are ordered to identify the land described in the permit. The relevant

Respondent authorities are also ordered to conduct an inquiry into the matter of

succession, bearing in mind that the Courts have determined that the 1st Petitioner is the

lawful successor.

Considering that this application involved twenty-plus years of contentious legal

battles, we conclude this judgment with reference to an observation of his Lordship

Amerasinghe J. in Jeyaraj Fernandopulle v. Premachandra De Silva [1996] 1 SLR 70:

Public policy requires that there must be an end to litigation, for the sake of certainty and

the maintenance of law and order, in the pacific settlement of disputes between the citizen and the

Page 16 of 16

State or between other persons; for the sake of preventing the vexation of persons by those who

can afford to indulge in litigation; and for the conservation of the resources of the State. Interest

rei publicae ut sit finis litium.

This Application is allowed. We make no order for costs.
