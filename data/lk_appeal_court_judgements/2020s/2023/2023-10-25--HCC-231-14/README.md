The 2nd Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd Accused) along with

Priyanga Ekanayaka (the 1st Accused) was indicted in the High Court of Kandy for the

following charges:

Count 1: For conspiring and aiding and abetting to commit forgery under Section

454 of the Penal Code read with Section 113(b) and 102 of the Penal Code and

Count 2, Count 3 and Count 4: For committing forgery on three valuable securities

namely deed nos. 2651, 3004,3012 and thereby committing Forgery under Section

456 of the Penal Code.

The case advanced by the prosecution contended that the two defendants had

engaged in a conspiracy to fabricate deceptive legal instruments pertaining to a property

known as Kadirane Estate, located on Airport Road in Katunayake. The alleged

conspiracy involved the fraudulent introduction of two impersonators who purported to

be Lilian Victoria De Silva Amarasekara Jayawardenathe ostensible donor of the

landand Nihal Dunstan Ranasinghe, who was presented as a witness to the deeds. As

Page 3 of 16

a result of this collusive scheme, three counterfeit deeds were prepared through the

agency of these impersonators.

The prosecution presented its case through the evidence of nineteen witnesses and

submitted documentary evidence, designated as Exhibits A1 to A46, before resting its

case. Conversely, the second defendant took the stand and offered evidence from the

witness box, led the evidence of six additional witnesses, and marked documents as

Exhibits V1 to V22 before closing the defense's case.

It is crucial to highlight that at the initiation of the trial proceedings, the first

defendant entered a guilty plea to all the charges brought against him. He was

subsequently sentenced to six months of rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs.

10,000 for each respective count. The sentences meted out were suspended for a period of

five years.

The second defendant was found guilty on all four charges levied against him

and was sentenced as follows: For Charge 1, he received a term of five years of rigorous

imprisonment. For Charges 2, 3, and 4, he was sentenced to fifteen years of rigorous

imprisonment along with a financial penalty of Rs. 50,000. In the event of default in

payment, a supplementary sentence of one year of rigorous imprisonment would be

imposed.

Being aggrieved by the said convictions the 2nd Accused appealed to this court and

tendered the following grounds of appeal:

A. Has the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the totality of the

evidence led by the Prosecution does not prove the case against the accused-

appellant beyond reasonable doubt?

B. Did the Learned High Court Judge misdirect himself by not considering whether

the attesting of a signature to a document amount to a false document within the

meaning of Section 453 of the Penal Code?

Page 4 of 16

C. Did the Learned High Court Judge misdirect himself when he took into

consideration the fact that of the 1st pleaded guilty to the charges as an item of

evidence against the accused appellant who was a co-accused in the case?

D. Did the Learned High Court Judge by taking into consideration the admission of

guilt made by the 1st accused against the accused appellant cause grave prejudice

to the accused appellant and thereby deprived the accused appellant of a fair trial.

E. Did the Learned High Court Judge misdirect himself by not correctly evaluating

the defense put forward by the accused appellant and thereby was there a

miscarriage of justice.

F. Did the Learned High Court Judge fail to properly appreciate the items of evidence

which tends to show that it could have been the 1st Accused who may have

fraudulently got persons to sign as Lilian Victoria De Silva Amarasekara

Jayawardena and Nihal Dunstan Ranasinghe unknown to the Accused appellant

and therefore there was no criminality attached to the conduct of the accused

appellant.

I now turn to a detailed examination of the evidence levied against the second

accused in relation to the multiple charges arrayed against him.

As per the evidence of Prosecution Witness 10 (PW10), Colvin Kovinda, he

acquired ownership of the subject land under Deed No. 529. Subsequent to this

acquisition, the land was officially expropriated through a Gazette Notification bearing

No. 320/05 dated June 5, 1978, which was marked as Exhibit A2 by the prosecution.

However, the same tract of land was later restored to Colvin Kovinda's ownership through

another Gazette Notification, numbered 831/20 and dated August 12, 1994. After

regaining possession, he disposed of 299 perches from the entire property to Complainant

Basnayake.

Corroborating this narrative, Prosecution Witness 1 (PW1), Sumedha Basnayake,

also offered evidence in this case.

Page 5 of 16

Turning to the evidence of Prosecution Witness 4 (PW4), Nihal Dunstan

Ranasinghe, he indicated that he had first made the acquaintance of the first accused in

the year 1997 through a professional relationship. He stated emphatically that he had

never engaged in any discussion concerning land transactions with the first accused,

although he did allude to a deed. On one particular evening, he received a telephonic

communication from the first accused, who requested his National Identity Card

number653010869 Vand his residential address. The information was to be used for

obtaining his signature as a witness at a future date. He conveyed his Identity Card

number via text message and vocalized his address over the phone call. Ranasinghe

further averred that his initial encounter with the second accused occurred when officers

of the Criminal Investigation Department (C.I.D.) arrived at his residence.

On Page 381:

A statement was duly recorded by the Criminal Investigation Department (C.I.D.)

from Prosecution Witness 4 (PW4), and samples of his signature were taken for forensic

scrutiny. PW4 categorically denied affixing his signature to any deeds bearing the

numbers 2651, 2665, and 3012. When inquired about his acquaintance with PW5, he

disavowed ever meeting him or travelling to Kandy for any related matters. He remained

oblivious to any deed signing involving the first and second accused until the moment the

C.I.D. appeared at his residence.

As for Prosecution Witness 5 (PW5), Chandima Wijesinghe, an Attorney-at-Law

and Notary, he testified that the second accused was introduced to him by his clerk, PW6.

PW5 stated that PW6 was responsible for preparing the pertinent documents and that he

had been informed when Lilianthe alleged witnessand other parties had arrived at

his office. Despite being physically constrained due to an accident, he asserted that he

could hear their conversations and observe the proceedings from a distance of

approximately 15 feet within his chamber. Notably, Lilian did not appear before him

during the signing of the documents. Gift deeds numbered 2651, 3004, and 3012,

transferring property from Lilan to the first accused, were signed and duly registered.

Deed 2665 was also executed for the purpose of transferring ownership from the first

accused to the second accused. Upon being interrogated by the C.I.D. on February 17,

2012, he discovered that the deeds were fabricated with spurious witnesses, as Lilian's

Page 6 of 16

address did not correspond to the one recorded, namely No. 76 Kurunegala Rd,

Minuwangoda. PW5 conceded that he had not been particularly vigilant in this matter,

largely because he had relied on the information furnished by PW6, his clerk.

It can be deduced from PW5's evidence that he proceeded to notarize the deeds

based on his trust in PW6, without having direct personal knowledge of the parties

involved, as mandated by the Notaries Ordinance. This transgression was highlighted by

the Learned Trial Judge in his judgment. While the judge did find fault in the notary's

conduct, it is important to note that this particular finding does not necessarily bolster

the prosecution's case.

According to the evidence of Prosecution Witness 6 (PW6), Peiris, the former clerk

to PW5, he acknowledged having a personal relationship with the 2nd Accused dating

back to 2006, when the latter served as a real estate broker. PW6 stated that he was the

one who prepared the contentious deeds under scrutiny. He narrated that the 2nd Accused

had introduced the 1st Accused, donor Lilian, and purported witness Nihal during the

deed attestation process. PW6 prepared a series of deeds, namely 2651, 2665, 3004, and

3012, based on these introductions. Notably, only the I.D. number of the purported

witness appeared on the deeds; no identification details for Lilian were provided beyond

her address at No. 76 Kurunegala Rd, Minuwangoda. He admitted that he had proceeded

with the deed preparations based on his trust in the 2nd Accused, only to later discover

the problematic nature of these deeds during his questioning by the C.I.D.

During cross-examination, PW6 reiterated his long-standing relationship with the

2nd Accused and maintained that he had acted in good faith, predicated upon the trust

he had in the 2nd Accused. However, he was unaware that the 2nd Accused was directly

involved in the land transactions under scrutiny.

Inspector of Police (I.P.) Paduka of the C.I.D., designated as Prosecution Witness

11 (PW11), testified that he initiated an investigation following a complaint lodged by

PW1 on February 9, 2012. During his investigation, he found that neither Lilian nor the

purported witness Nihal were residents at the addresses specified in the deeds.

Subsequent inquiries corroborated that the deeds were indeed fraudulent, prompting the

summons of both accused parties for questioning. Forensic examination further revealed

that the signature attributed to PW4 did not match, solidifying the conclusion that the

documents were forged.

Page 7 of 16

A pivotal query before this Court is whether Lilian Victoria De Silva Amarasekara

Jayawardena, named in deeds 2651, 3004, and 3012, is a real or fictitious person and

whether she holds any legitimate claim over the land in question. According to

Prosecution Witness 26 (PW26), Newton Jayawardene, there is no family member bearing

that name. Further, Prosecution Witness 2 (PW2), Grama Niladhari Pushpakumara

Perera, confirmed that no records exist supporting Lilian's residence at the cited address,

which in reality belongs to one Pathiranalage Harischandra, designated as PW3.

According to PW26, it becomes evident that a person named Lilian Mary Theresa

existed, but there is no individual known as Lilian Victoria De Silva Amarasekara

Jayawardena. If this is the case, what then is the legal impact on the deeds 2651, 3004,

and 3012, which the so-called Lilian had bequeathed to the 1st Accused? The crux of the

matter is the authenticity of this purported Lilian's ownership of the land in question.

It is a settled legal principle that a deed executed by a fictitious person is rendered

void ab initio. Nonetheless, in the case at hand, the deeds are conspicuously silent on how

this purported Lilian acquired her title to the property. This gap could have been filled if

PW5 had conducted a due diligence check on the land registry to ascertain the previous

owner of the property. The prosecution has not sufficiently proven whether the 2nd

Accused impersonated the real owner for the execution of the deeds, or whether the name

Lilian bears no connection to the title at all.

Generally, a legitimate owner would lodge a complaint with the police upon

discovering that their property had been transferred without their consent, alleging that

their signature was forged. Alternatively, the Attorney-at-Law who facilitated the deed

may lodge a similar complaint. In the matter before us, neither has occurred.

Furthermore, while the police have stated that no individual named Lilian Victoria

De Silva Amarasekara Jayawardena exists, the question remains as to the identity of this

individual and, indeed, the true ownership of the property in question. No witness has

provided answers to these pivotal queries. Concurrently, there exists evidence indicating

that PW4s signature was fraudulently replicated; however, no conclusive evidence

demonstrates that the 1st and 2nd Accused collaborated to forge PW4's signature on the

deed.

Page 8 of 16

Accused version

The 2nd Accused testified that he specialized in resolving unsettled land cases as a

real estate broker. He met the 1st Accused initially in 1996, and later consulted on a

property dispute in Katunayake connected to the 1st Accused's relative. The 2nd Accused

acquired pertinent documents, including certified deed 969, confirming the 1st Accused's

ownership, issued by the District Registrar of Negombo.

A land survey was conducted by Thilakaratne, who prepared plan 619A, in the

presence of both Accused, their family members, and friends. The 1st Accused identified

his grandmother, Lilian Victoria De Silva Jayawardena, as the property's owner,

necessitating a change in ownership.

In July 2011, a deed was drafted in PW5's office; the donor Lilian and witness

Nihal were introduced to the 2nd Accused by the 1st Accused. A series of deeds were

executed, involving both Accused, their families, and purported witnesses. The 2nd

Accused denied allegations of fraudulent intent when cross-examined. All relevant

documents were seized by the C.I.D. post-arrest.

During cross-examination, the 2nd Accused affirmed his acquaintance with the 1st

Accused, who had introduced Lilian as his grandmother. The 2nd Accused confirmed prior

surveying that established the two properties as distinct, albeit adjacent. He reiterated

that the 1st Accused should have been vigilant about the details on the gift deed. Upon

inquiry, he stated the deeds were handed over to his legal representation.

Considering the totality of evidence, it emerges that both Accused were embroiled

in a land dispute; the 2nd Accused even obtained a court order affirming his ownership of

lot 18 via deed 2665. However, given that both the prosecution and defense have opted

not to contest the land dispute in question, I shall refrain from delving into the title of the

deed.

In assessing the case, due weight should be given to incontrovertibly proven facts,

as well as those contested by the 2nd Accused. This will facilitate a thorough examination

of the validity of the court's findings concerning the acceptance or rejection of these facts.

I reproduce the findings of the Learned High Court Judge pertaining to the

adverse inferences taken against the 2nd Accused.

However, we find no evidence to indicate that the 2nd Accused was aware that Lilian

Victoria de Silva Amarasekara Jayawardena and Nihal Dunstan Ranasinghe were not

the genuine signatories of the contested deeds.

The primary argument presented by the Learned Counsel for the 2nd Accused

centers on the allegation in Count 1 of the charge sheet: namely, whether the 2nd Accused

colluded with the 1st Accused to acquire the property by means of introducing fictitious

witnesses. The Learned Counsel for the 2nd Accused posits that these fabricated

individuals were not known to the 2nd Accused, thereby negating the notion of criminal

liability against him.

Upon analysis of the Learned High Court Judge's judgment, it is evident that the

court has predicated its conclusion on the existence of a conspiracy. Nonetheless, as per

Section 113(b), it is incumbent upon us to acknowledge that to be culpable for the offense

outlined in Section 454, there must be mutual intent to commit the crime. The prosecution

claims that the donor and the 2nd witness were fictitious and impersonated, respectively.

However, the sole piece of evidence implicating the 2nd Accused is his introduction of

these individuals to PW6 subsequent to the transfer of deed 2665 and the gifting of the

Page 10 of 16

deed to the 1st Accused. In light of this, the Learned High Court Judge's conclusion

concerning the 2nd Accused appears to be predicated more on suspicion than on

substantiated evidence.

Indeed, it is confirmed that the 2nd Accused introduced the 1st Accused and the

ostensible parties to the transaction. According to the evidence of PW6, the 2nd Accused,

a real estate broker, frequently brings clients to him and engages in property transactions.

However, no evidence exists to substantiate who supplied the details pertaining to the

Donor's address. Conversely, evidence does indicate that it was the 1st Accused who

obtained information from PW4.

In scrutinizing the conclusions reached by the Learned High Court Judge, it

becomes apparent that a comprehensive evaluation of the evidence presented by both the

prosecution and the defense was not undertaken. This omission calls into question the

Page 11 of 16

extent to which the totality of evidence supports the allegations against the 2nd Accused

as outlined in the charge sheet. Consequently, the opinions expressed by the Learned

High Court Judge may reasonably be considered as speculative.

Therefore, the question arises as to whether the 2nd Accused could be convicted for

the offence of conspiracy defined under Section 113(a) of the Penal Code.

In King vs. M.E.A. Cooray [1950], 51 NLR 433, His Lordship Gratian J held that;

If the offence of "criminal conspiracy " as defined by section 113A of the Penal Code

be compared with the corresponding offence which has been either defined by statute in

India or judicially interpreted as a common law offence in England, it emerges that the

vital respect in which the Ceylon Legislature had departed from the existing models was

by restricting the offence in this country to agreements designed to further the

commission or the abetment of criminal acts-and that agreement to commit unlawful acts

which are not offences, or to perform by illegal means acts which are themselves lawful,

were not caught up in the new section.

On page 439;

It seems to us that the words "with or without previous concert or deliberation"

were advisedly introduced into the language of section 113A of the Penal Code so as to

make it clear that, for the purpose of establishing the offence of criminal conspiracy, the

only form of "agreement" which needs to be proved is an "agreement with a common

design" as explained in the judgments to which I have referred.

Another argument which was addressed to us was that, if "agreement" be the vital

ingredient of every form of conspiracy contemplated by section 113A, the words "agree to

.... act together with a common purpose for or in committing or abetting an offence" would

be redundant because they are in effect synonymous with the earlier words "agree to

commit or abet an offence". We are not convinced that the meaning of these phrases is

necessarily identical. One can conceive, for instance, of an agreement between A and B to

commit acts (of preparation) which, though designed to further the commission of an

offence by C, might possibly fall short of the actual abetment of a criminal act.

Page 12 of 16

The King v Andree [1941], 42 NLR, 495, on page 500, His Lordship Soertsz J, held that:

In regard to this contention, under our law the position appears to be, as I have

pointed out, that it is not necessary to prove agreement, either directly or inferentially. It

is sufficient to prove that the accused acted together with a common purpose for or in

committing an offence.

(Emphasis added)

The above-said judgements were referred by Justice Dep, P.C, J (as he was then), in

the case of Mazur Ivegen and another v A.G, S.C App TAB/1/2015, decided on 08.12.2016.

In Tillakaratne and others v A.G [1989], 2 S.L.R, 54 on page 61, His Lordship

Wijeratne J held that;

Conspiracy can ordinarily be proved only by a mere inference from the subsequent

conduct of the parties in committing some overt acts which tend so obviously towards the

alleged unlawful acts as to suggest that they must have arisen from an agreement to bring

it about.

In Ratanlal and Dhirajlal proposed the following thesis in The Indian Penal Code

30th Edition re-print 2009 on page 193;

It should, however, be remembered that where there is no direct evidence, for

example through the evidence of an approver, and the case for the prosecution is

dependent on circumstantial evidence alone, it is necessary for the prosecution to prove

and establish such circumstances as would lead to the only conclusion of existence of a

criminal conspiracy and rule out the theory of innocence.

Ratanlal and Dhirajlal(supra) followed the case of Dadasaheb Bapusaheb Naik and

Etc. vs State of Maharashtra [1981], 1982 Cr LJ 856, it was held;

Admittedly, this is a case wherein the prosecution rests entirely on circumstantial

evidence for proving the alleged criminal conspiracy between accused Nos. 1, 2 and 4 to

cheat the Zilla Parishad and/or the panchayat Samiti. Parner by preparing false accounts.

It appears that the investigating agency thought that the circumstances referred to above

were sufficient enough to establish a clinching case of conspiracy without any direct

evidence. In cases of conspiracy, though it is true that direct evidence other than that

Page 13 of 16

furnished by an approver is not generally available, it cannot be disputed that in those

cases of conspiracy in which the prosecution relies only on circumstantial evidence to

establish a criminal agreement between the accused persons to commit an alleged offence,

it is necessary for the prosecution to prove and establish such circumstances as would

lead to the only conclusion of existence of a criminal conspiracy. If there are circumstances

compatible with innocence of the accused persons, the prosecution cannot succeed on the

basis of such circumstantial evidence.

There are cases of criminal conspiracy in which evidence adduced by the

prosecution for proving criminal conspiracy is the same as evidence for establishing the

offence which is alleged to be the object of the criminal conspiracy. I feel that in such cases

if the prosecution is not able to establish its case so far as the main offence constituting

the object of criminal conspiracy is concerned, it will be extremely unsafe to find the

accused persons guilty of abetment of the said offence with the aid of S. 120-B, I.P.C.

unless by unimpeachable evidence, circumstances incompatible with the non-existence of

criminal conspiracy are established by the prosecution.

This court observes that there is an absence of sufficient and credible evidence to

conclude that the 2nd Accused entered into a conspiracy with the 1st Accused to produce

the impugned forged documents, an act that would be punishable under Section 456 of

the Penal Code. The extant evidence is inadequate to substantiate that the alleged

conspiracy preceded the actions, such as knowing that the donor was fictitious or that the

attesting witness was impersonated for the purpose of generating the questioned deeds.

In other words, the acts were not committed in furtherance of any pre-existing conspiracy.

It is of utmost importance to ascertain whether there existed a prior agreement or

mutual understanding between the 2nd Accused and the 1st Accused aimed at conspiring

to commit the offense. To this end, the observations already made will be considered

carefully.

In Sudu Aiya and others v A.G[2004], 2005 1 S.L.R 358 on page 368 His Lordship Hector

Yapa J held that;

Conspiracy can ordinarily be proved only by a mere inference from the subsequent

conduct of the parties in committing some overt acts which tend so obviously towards the

alleged unlawful results as to suggest that they must have arisen from an agreement to

Page 14 of 16

bring it about. Upon each of the isolated acts a conjectural interpretation is put, and from

the aggregate of these interpretations an inference is drawn.

(emphasis added)

Indeed, while the 2nd Accused did introduce the donor, the 1st Accused, and the

individual impersonating PW4 to PW6 during the preparation of the deeds, it was in fact

the 1st Accused who brought forth the impersonator of PW4 and Lilian Victoria De Silva

Amarasekara Jayawardena. This raises questions about the extent of the 2nd Accused's

knowledge concerning the fictitious nature of these individuals. The additional point of

contention is whether a prudent person, knowing that these documents were forged,

would retain the property or dispose of it immediately. This issue has not been adequately

addressed, as the Learned High Court Judge did not venture into this matter.

Furthermore, it is apparent that the prosecution has failed to prove the essential elements

of the charges brought against the 2nd Accused under Section 454 of the Penal Code.

The subsequent matter under scrutiny pertains to the authenticity of the impugned

deeds. Given that the Donor was fictitious and the attesting witness was impersonated,

there exists a question of whether the 2nd Accused could be legally convicted for this

offense. To delve into this, it is pertinent to reference the relevant provisions concerning

the making of a false document, as outlined in Section 453 of the Penal Code:

A person is said to make a false document

Firstly Who dishonestly or fraudulently makes, signs, seals, or executes a document or

part of a document or makes any mark denoting the execution of a document with the

intention of causing it to be believed that such document or part of a document was made,

signed, sealed, or executed, by or by the authority of a person by whom or by whose

authority he knows that is was not made, signed, sealed, or executed, or at a time which

he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed or executed; or

Secondly Who, without lawful authority, dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or

otherwise, alters a document in any material part thereof, after it has been made or

executed either by himself or by any other person, whether such person be living or dead

at the time of such alteration; or

Thirdly Who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute, or

alter a document, knowing that such person by reason of unsoundness of mind or

Page 15 of 16

intoxication cannot, or that by reason of deception practised upon him he does not, know

the contents of the document or the nature of the alteration.

Withers J in the case of The Queen v Kapurala 2 NLR 330, has described what are

the elements to be proved in such a situation:

" A person is said to make a false document " who dishonestly or fraudulently

makes, signs, seals, or executes " a document or part of a document, or makes any mark

denoting the execution of a document, with the intention of causing it to be believed that

such document or part of a document was made, signed, sealed, or executed by or by the

authority of a person by whom or by whose " authority he knows that it was not made,

signed, sealed, "or executed, or at a time at which he knows that it was "not made, signed,

sealed, or executed."

(emphasis added).

In light of False documents being made Ratanlal and Dhirajlal(supra) followed the

case of Re: Riasat Ali, Alias Babu Miya v Unknown [1881], 1881 ILR 7 Cal 352, His

Lordship Richard Garth, C.J held that;

I consider that the "making" of a document, or part of a document, does not mean

"writing" or "printing" it, but signing or otherwise executing it; as in legal phrase we speak

of "making an indenture" or "making a promissory note," by which is not meant the

writing out of the form of the instrument, but the sealing or signing it as a deed or note.

The fact that the word "makes" is used in the section in conjunction with the words "signs,"

"seals" or "executes," or makes any mark "denoting the execution, &c., "seems to me very

clearly to denote that this is its true meaning. What constitutes a false document, or part

of a document, is not the writing of any number of words which in themselves are

innocent, but the affixing the seal or signature of some person to the document, or part of

a document, knowing that the seal or signature is not his, and that he gave no authority

to affix it. In other words, the falsity consists in the document, or part of a document,

being signed or sealed with the name or seal of a person who did not in fact sign or seal

it.

According to section 453, there are three elements that should be established by

the prosecution;

Page 16 of 16

1. That the Accused knew that the person who executed had no authority to do that

and,

2. It was not signed by him.

3. This act was done dishonestly and fraudulently.

Upon a thorough examination of the totality of the evidence presented, this court

determines that the prosecution has been unsuccessful in establishing that the 2nd

Accused had knowledge that persons who have signed as Lilan Victoria De Silva

Amarasekara Jayawardena and Nihal Dunstan Ranasinghe were fictitious entities.

In light of the foregoing, this court concludes that there is neither sufficient nor

credible evidence to substantiate the charges leveled against the 2nd Accused. Having

carefully weighed all arguments and evidence brought before us, we are inclined to allow

the appeal and, accordingly, set aside both the conviction and the sentence previously

imposed.

This appeal is allowed.
