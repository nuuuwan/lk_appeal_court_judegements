Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the first accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved of his conviction and the sentence by the learned

High Court Judge of Colombo.

The appellant along with another was indicted before the High Court of Colombo

for committing three counts of murder on or about 2nd November 2006,

punishable in terms of section 296 read with section 32 of the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, the learned High Court Judge of Colombo by his

judgement dated 20th July 2018 found the appellant guilty as charged. The 2nd

accused indicted was acquitted of all the charges.

This is a case where the prosecution has relied on one eye witness (PW-01) to

prove the case against the accused. Evidence shows that this was a result of a

gang related violence and the apparent target of this incident had been the PW-

01 namely, Mohomad Zahir Mohomad Saleem.

According to his evidence, he has been released from remand custody a day

before this incident took place. He was in remand custody as a suspect in a case

of murder.

On the day of the incident, while being in the company of the three deceased

persons, several persons have come and fired at them using a firearm he referred

to as a machine gun. He says that after firing at two of the deceased persons,

the appellant fired at the person called Berty who was in front of him and the

mentioned Berty fell on him. As a result, both of them fell onto the ground. As

there was blood all over him, he has pretended as if he too got shot, which

resulted in the assailants running away from the scene of crime believing that

their target was achieved. He has given evidence saying that when he looked at

the persons who were fleeing, he saw the appellant, the 2nd accused indicted and

several others, getting into a three-wheeler and fleeing from the scene.

He has stated that after the incident, he went into hiding fearing for his life and

made a statement to the police three months after the incident. He has explained

further that while in hiding, he informed about the incident to the Officer-in-

charge of the police station over the phone, informing that he will come and make

a statement later due to his fear of being attacked. However, the mentioned OIC

who has given evidence as PW-09 has denied that PW-01 gave him a call and

informed of his difficulty to come to the police station. He has specifically stated

that if such an information was provided, he would have definitely made notes

of it and proceed with his investigations.

The position taken up by the appellant as well as the 2nd accused indicted had

been that they were never involved in this crime. They have claimed that they

were never arrested nor any statement was recorded from them, and they came

to know that they are being charged for the crime, only after they received

summons from the High Court, requiring them to appear before the Court. They

have denied any involvement in this crime.

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

one ground of appeal on the basis that the learned High Court Judge has

convicted the appellant without considering the reasonable doubts that have

been created as to the involvement of the appellant to the crime.

In her submissions, she relied mainly on the belatedness of the statement made

by the only alleged eyewitness to the incident contending that relying only on

such a witness is highly unsafe, given the facts and the circumstances that led

to the charges being laid against the appellant and the other person indicted.

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) having considered the facts

and the relevant circumstances, brought to the notice of the Court that, in fact,

the appellant and the other person indicted had never been arrested and

statements recorded by the police. Having considered the procedure followed by

the police to investigate the matter and conduct the non-summary proceedings

on the basis that the appellant and the other person cannot be apprehended, it

was his view that he is in no position to agree with the way the investigations

that had been conducted in this matter.

Under the circumstances, he agreed that the appellant has not been afforded a

fair trial in accordance with the due process of the law and therefore, relying on

a witness who has made a belated statement was not safe to conclude that the

charges have been proved beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant.

As pointed out by the learned Counsel for the appellant as well as the learned

SDSG, this is a matter where the conviction has been solely based on the

evidence of PW-01, who was the only witness who speaks about the involvement

of the appellant and the other person to the crime. Therefore, it becomes

necessary for this Court to consider whether the evidence of PW-01 was reliable

and trustworthy to rely on his evidence alone for a conviction. In view of the

appellants contention that he was unaware that he was an accused or even a

suspect in this matter, and he came to the High Court only upon summons is

concerned, it is also necessary to find out the reasons for such a situation.

It was in evidence that when this incident took place, there were four persons

and three of them were shot. When police came to the place of the incident, the

4th person who could have provided vital information as to the crime, was

nowhere to be seen. The 4th person mentioned was the PW-01 who has given

evidence at the trial.

Although this incident has happened on 02-11-2006, PW-01 has given a

statement to police on 21-02-2007, around three months after the incident.

Giving evidence in Court, he has explained the delay in making a statement

claiming that he was fearful of his life and was in hiding. But he has also claimed

that he informed about the incident to the OIC of the Wellampitiya police station.

However, the then OIC of the Wellampitiya police station has denied that he was

informed by PW-01 of his inability to make a due statement.

It appears from the Magistrate Court case record that initially, the police have

arrested two other persons in relation to the crime and they had been kept in

remand custody over a period of time until they were discharged after the

conclusion of the non-summary proceedings, of the order dated 18-11-2008 by

the learned Magistrate. It is not in evidence on what basis that they were initially

arrested soon after the crime, if not for the information that may have been

provided by an eyewitness.

The OIC of Wellampitiya police has filed the plaint and the charge sheet before

the Magistrate in this matter, initially on 13-03-2008, and again on 14-07-2008,

naming the appellant as the 3rd accused and the 2nd accused indicted, as the 4th

accused to the murders committed.

Apparently, this has been a result of the statement made by PW-01 21-02-2007.

It appears that until the plaint was filed, the Wellampitiya police have failed to

file additional information before the learned Magistrate to indicate that PW-01

has given a statement and even to name the appellant and the other person

indicted, as suspects for this murder.

Page 6 of 7

The Magistrate Court case record bears testimony that at the non-summary

inquiry stage, police have informed the learned Magistrate that the 3rd and the

4th accused mentioned in the charge sheet are evading arrest. Accordingly, it

appears that a police officer from Wellampitiya police has given evidence before

the learned Magistrate stating that the 3rd and the 4th accused, namely the

appellant and the 2nd accused indicted, are not residing in their given addresses

and cannot be arrested, and they are evading arrest. On that basis, an

application has been made to commence non-summary proceedings in terms of

section 148 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

However, although the police have given the residential addresses of the

appellant and the other person to the Court and claimed that they are not living

at the addresses given, when the High Court issued summons for them to the

same addresses, they have promptly appeared before the High Court. This goes

on to show that they have been living there and had not absconded but due to

the failures of the police to conduct proper investigations, they have not been

arrested or statements recorded.

As agreed by the SDSG, this is not the way the proceedings should be conducted

in a serious crime of this nature. As an accused person too is equally entitled to

the protection of the law, I find that the appellant has been denied of a fair trial

due to the irregularities in the investigations in this case.

The delay in making a statement to the police becomes relevant in the above

context. Although PW-01 has claimed that he informed the OIC his inability to

make a prompt statement, the OIC has denied such an information was

provided. If such an information was provided, the police would have provided

that information to the learned Magistrate and name the appellant and the other

person as suspects from the inception of the proceedings in this case.

PW-01 is a person who is well conversant with the way the legal system

functions. He had been a suspect in a previous murder case, where he has been

released, according to his own evidence, upon him producing the relevant

Page 7 of 7

documents to show that he was elsewhere at the time the alleged murder took

place. To make such a submission to the Court, he must have had necessary

legal advice as well. Therefore, for such a person, even though if he was in hiding

as claimed, there cannot be any impediment to provide the necessary

information as to the suspects of this murder to the police. Such a person

making a statement three months after the incident in my view, is a statement

that cannot be relied upon on that alone. I am of the view that relying on the

evidence based on such a belated statement in a serious crime of this nature is

highly unsafe, without sufficient corroboration.

In the case of Alim Vs. Wijesinghe, S.I. Police Batticaloa, 38 CLW 95, it was

held that; where the same facts are capable of inference in favour of the accused

and also of an inference against him, the inference consistent with his innocence

should be preferred.

For the reasons as set out above, I find merit in the appeal and find that it is not

safe to let the conviction and the sentence of the appellant stand.

Accordingly, I set aside the conviction and the sentence and acquit the appellant

from the charges preferred against him.

The appeal is allowed.
