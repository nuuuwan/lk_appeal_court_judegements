JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General for committing the offence

as mentioned below.

On or about the 24th of October 2014 the accused-Appellant committed the

murder of Emshiya Suresh at Ragala which is an offence punishable under

Section 296 of Penal Code.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Nuwara Eliya as the

Appellant opted for a non-jury trial. The prosecution had led 09 witnesses

and marked production P1-13 and closed the case. The Learned High Court

Judge having satisfied that evidence presented by the prosecution warranted

a case to answer, called for the defence and explained the rights of the

accused. The Appellant made a very brief dock statement and closed his

case.

After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High

Court Judge had convicted the Appellant as charged and sentenced him to

death on 04/08/2020.

3

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given his consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid

19 pandemic. At the hearing, the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

In his solitary ground of appeal, the Learned Counsel contended that the

prosecution failed to prove a conscious and voluntary act on part of the

Appellant.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

On the day of the incident, PW2 Pathmawathi, the mother of the Appellant

had gone to Ragala Hospital to bring medicine for the son of the Appellant.

She had left the deceased Emsia the daughter of the Appellant under the

Appellants care. When she returned home the deceased was not to be seen.

At that time, the Appellant was under the influence of liquor. First, she had

gone to a nearby house in search of the deceased. As the deceased was not

there, she had gone to her sisters house in search of the deceased.

Thereafter, PW2s sister and her son also went in search of the deceased.

PW3 Devaletchumi was the landlord of the house where the Appellants

family lived. Hearing the that the deceased was not to be seen, she had gone

to the Appellant and inquired about the deceased. The Appellant first had

told her that the deceased had been taken to S.O.S School Nuwara Eliya.

Thereafter he had told that he killed the deceased and dumped her body into

the toilet pit.

PW7 is the son of PW3 who had also spoken to the Appellant regarding the

deceased. The Appellant had told him that he sent the deceased to an

appropriate place. Thereafter this witness had searched the house and found

the deceased under a bed. Her body had been covered with a Urea bag. When

he carried the body, he had seen reddish patches around the deceaseds

4

neck. Having felt that the deceased was still alive, he had taken the deceased

to Ragala Hospital in a three-wheeler first. From there she was taken to

Nuwara Eliya Hospital but pronounced dead on admission.

PW8 the three-wheeler driver also had noted reddish patches around the

deceaseds neck when he transported the deceased to the hospital.

PW6 Sivalingam is the brother of the landlady of the house where the

deceased lived. On the day of the incident, he had repaired the roof of the

Appellants house. He had seen Appellants mother and his son were leaving

the house in the morning. The Appellant had also climbed to the roof to assist

this witness. The Appellant had assisted him up to 10.00 am, went for tea

and not returned thereafter. This witness had seen PW3 and Appellants son

returning home at about 11.00am. According to him while he was on the roof

no outsider had entered the house of the Appellant. The rear door of the

Appellants house had been permanently closed during that time.

PW13, the JMO who carried out he post-mortem opined that compression of

neck due to ligature strangulation had caused the death of the deceased.

The Appellant had been referred to a Psychiatric and a report was obtained

before the trial started. According to report of PW14, he had stated that he

is fit to plead and stand for trial. The report was issued on 14/11/2014 i.e.,

after about 18 days of the incident. The doctor also stated that he needs

further information to reconstruct his mental state at the time of the alleged

incident. Therefore, he could not comment on his criminal responsibility at

the time of the examination.

In this case, the injuries sustained by the deceased play a decisive role in

determination of this case as to whether the Appellant had actuated the

murderous intention or not. Hence, the circumstantial evidence pertaining

to injuries found on the deceaseds body need to be discussed in detail.

According to the JMO, Irregular shaped, scattered abrasions were

distributed around the neck of the deceased. Over the right side 4x3cm size

5

parchment abrasion noted. Over the front side above abrasion continues in

a less prominent manner covering the left and back sides of the neck.

Scattered abrasions size varies from 0.1 x 5cm to 3x1cm, more than 30 in

number distributed around the neck. Close observation revealed ligature

mark more prominent on right side of the neck. (Collectively taken).

Abrasions 3 in number around right-side eye close to eye size varies from

3x1 cm to 1x0.5 cm.

Contusion laceration 2x3cm over front of lower lip with laceration placed

inner aspect of lip.

These injuries clearly indicated how the deceased had been strangled to

death.

It is trite law that the burden of proof is on the prosecution in all criminal

cases.

In The Queen v. K.A. Santin Singho 65 NLR 447 the court held that:

It is fundamental that the burden is on the prosecution. Whether the

evidence the prosecution relies on is direct or circumstantial, the burden

is the same. This burden is not altered by the failure of the appellant to

give evidence and explain the circumstances.

In this case no direct evidence is available but the case rests on

circumstantial evidence.

Circumstantial evidence is proof of a fact or even a set of facts from which

someone could infer the facts in question. It is a fact that somebody could

be convicted of crime based on circumstantial evidence. Further, with the

relatively common occurrence of false testimony and mistaken identification,

circumstantial proof can be more reliable than direct evidence.

6

In Premawansha v. Attorney General 2009 [2] SLR 205 the court held

that:

In a case of circumstantial evidence if an inference of guilt is to be

drawn, such an inference must be the one and only irresistible and

inescapable conclusion that the accused committed the offence.

In AG v. Potta Naufer & others 2007 2 SLR 144 the court held that:

When relying on circumstantial evidence to establish the charge of

conspiracy to commit murder and the charge of murder, the proved items

of circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point

towards the only inference that the accused committed the offence.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant mainly contended that the Learned

Trial Judge had failed to consider the mental condition of the Appellant

under the plea of Automatism to establish that the Appellants performance

of actions without conscious thought or intention.

The term Automatism refers to the involuntary conduct that the product of

a mental state in which the conscious mind is dissociated from the part of

the mind that controls action. Accordingly, automatism relates only to the

actus reus of the offence as it affects the voluntariness of the accuseds

actions.

The burden is on the accused to prove involuntariness on a balance of

probabilities. The accused has the evidentiary burden to adduce evidence to

raise the issue for the court and the legal burden of proving the fact alleged.

In R v. Enns 2016 ONSC 2229 (CanLII), per Fregeau J, at para 21 stated:

If the accused has laid proper foundation for the defence of automatism

and satisfied the evidentiary burden, the trial judge must then

determine whether mental disorder or non-mental disorder automatism

should be left with the trier of fact.

7

In R v. Stone [1999] 2 SCR 290 the court held that:

The law presumes that people act voluntarily. Since a defence of

automatism amounts to a claim that ones actions were not voluntary,

the accused must establish a proper foundation for this defence before

it can be left with the tier of fact.

In Gamini v. The Attorney General [1999] 1 SLR 321 the court held that:

The use of the criterion of external physical factors and internal

physical factors to distinguish between plea of automatism and

insanity is wholly incongruous in the law of Sri Lanka. Our law is

that in a plea of automatism the accused must lay a sufficient

foundation for his plea by leading evidence that his mind was not

controlling his limits at all at the time of the commission of the

offence. It is not sufficient for the accused to lay the foundation

and discharge his evidential burden by establishing that his mind

was acting imperfectly at that time, if he was still reacting to

stimuli and controlling his limbs in a purposive way. In such an

event he would fail to lay a sufficient foundation for the plea of

automatism. He must establish that his acts were wholly

conclusive and not purposive in any manner.

The Learned Counsel referring to the evidence and the report marked as P12

of PW14 the Consultant Psychiatric, stated that his mental condition at the

time committing the offence was not assessed by a doctor. Therefore,

convicting the Appellant for murder is not appropriate in this case. The

following portion of evidence given by PW14 is re-produced below:

Although PW14 expressed his opinion about mental condition of the

Appellant, when he examined the Appellant about 18 days after the incident,

he had not found any adverse mental condition of the Appellant.

It is noteworthy to mention that even though the Learned Counsel contended

that the prosecution had failed to prove a conscious and voluntary act on

part of the Appellant, the Appellant never put his mental condition as his

defence during the trial.

Considering case for the defence, it is crystal clear that the Appellant had

not laid a sufficient foundation for the plea of Automatism. Hence his

contention cannot be contemplated in this case.

As discussed under the appeal ground advanced by the Appellant, the

prosecution had adduced strong and incriminating circumstantial evidence

9

against the Appellant. The Learned High Court Judge had very correctly

analyzed all the evidence presented by both parties and had concluded that

all the circumstances are consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of

the Appellant and totally inconsistent with his innocence.

As the Learned High Court Judge had rightly convicted the Appellant for the

charge levelled against him in the indictment, I affirm the conviction and

dismiss the Appeal of the Appellant.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Nuwara Eliya along with the original case record.
