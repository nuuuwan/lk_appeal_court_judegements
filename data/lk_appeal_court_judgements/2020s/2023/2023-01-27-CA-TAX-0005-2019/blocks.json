Their Lordships, therefore reading the word including broadly have reached the same conclusion as Blagden J. at first instance, following the decision of Gilchrist J. in an earlier case of an appeal in Trinidad by one Joseph Galvan Kelshall (No. 443 of 1939). This construction as Gilchrist J. pointed out is supported by the fact that in sub-paragraph (f) there are no limiting words referring specifically to the acquiring of income, such as appear in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of the same section. Further, this construction is not inconsistent with section 12 which read together with section 10, is of limited application and does not take away that which has been expressly provided by section 10(1)(f) .",

Like here, the bank had invested money in Sri Lanka Development Bonds and claimed the exemption under section 9(f). The bank was given the benefit of exempting the income tax on accrued interest in Sri Lanka Development Banks. The bank claimed that the money it invested in the Sri Lanka Development Bonds denominated in USD issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka was the money that it borrowed from its depositors and therefore, the bank had to pay an interest to the said depositors.

In any event, the Appellant filed comprehensive written submissions before the argument commenced before us, and we heard Mr. Ameen on the contents of the said written submissions during the course of the argument arising from the said written submissions.
