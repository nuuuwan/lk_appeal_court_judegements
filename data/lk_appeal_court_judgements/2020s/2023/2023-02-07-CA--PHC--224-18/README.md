Judgment

This appeal emanates from the Order of the Provincial High Court of the Southern

Province holden in Galle in case bearing No. HC/Rev 83/2014, where the

Complainant-Petitioner canvassed the Order of the learned Magistrate of Baddegama

in case bearing No. 4091.

The Complainant has filed a private plaint on 28.10.2013 under and in terms of

Section 66 (1) (b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 informing a

breach of the peace affecting the premises in dispute. Thereafter, the learned

Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge had followed the procedure

stipulated in the Primary Courts Procedure Act and fixed the matter for inquiry.

After affidavits, counter affidavits with the documents and written submissions were

filed, the learned Magistrate has delivered the Order on 27.10.2014 in favour of the

1st and 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Appellants [hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the 1st and 2nd Appellants], on the basis that they were in possession of the

disputed premises on the relevant date material to the said Magistrates Court case

in terms of Section 68(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act and granted

possession of the same.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Complainant-Petitioner-Respondent

[hereinafter referred to as the Respondent]in this appeal had invoked the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Southern Province holden in Galle by

way of a revision application bearing No. Rev 83/2014.

In High Court, both parties had filed their objections, counter objections and

thereafter, the matter had been fixed for inquiry and disposed by way of written

submissions.

The Order was made by the learned High Court Judge on 28.12.2018 revising the said

Order of the learned Magistrate dated 27.10.2014 on the basis that it was contrary

to the provisions of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 and the learned

Magistrate had not made a determination under Section 68 (3) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act, determining whether the Respondent was dispossessed during the

presiding two months period of the institution of the Magistrates Court case.

Page 4 of 11

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned High Court Judge, the 1st and 2nd

Appellants have preferred this appeal seeking to have the Order revised or set aside

and have the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 27.10.2014 affirmed.

It was urged by the Counsel for the Respondent, Ms. Radha Kuruwitabandara that

the learned High Court Judge has held the Order dated 27.10.2014 of the learned

Magistrate was erroneous and revised the same on the basis that the learned

Magistrate had not considered Section 68 (3) of the Act but granted possession to

the 1st and 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Appellants [ ] without

considering the dispossession of the Respondent.

In this instance, it is worthy to note Subsections (1) and (3) of Section 68 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act;

(1) Where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or part thereof

it shall be the duty of the Judge of Primary Court holding the inquiry to

determine as to who was in possession of the land or the part on the date of

filing of the information under Section 66 and make order as to who is entitled

to possession of such land or part thereof.

(3) Where at an inquiry into a dispute relating to the right to the possession

of any land or any part of a land the Judge of the Primary Court is satisfied

that any person who had been in possession of the land or part has been

forcibly dispossessed within a period of two months immediately before the

date on which the information was filed under Section 66, he may make a

determination to that effect and make an order directing the party

dispossessed be restored to possession and prohibiting all disturbance of such

possession otherwise than under the authority of an order or decree of a

competent Court.

The learned Magistrate held that the Appellants were in possession of the disputed

premises in terms of Section 68 (1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act. However,

it was the contention of the Respondent that facts and circumstances of the instant

case are based on forcible dispossession under Section 68 (3) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act. Moreover, it was contended that the learned Magistrate has

considered the matter in terms of Section 68 (1) of the Act, disregarding Section 68

(3) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, and caused a great prejudice to the

Respondent.

Page 5 of 11

However, it is settled law that Section 68 (3) becomes applicable only if the Judge

of the Primary Court can come to a definite finding that some other party had been

forcibly dispossessed within a period of 2 months immediately before the date on

which the information was filed under Section 66 of the Act [Ramalingam Vs.

Thangarajah 1982 2SLR 693]. This position has been cited in the recent Judgment

of Ranjith Mervyn Ponnamperuma Vs. Warahena Liayanage Viraj Pradeep

Kumara De Alwis and Others [CA PHC 71/2008], decided on 12.06.2020.

It is in evidence that premises in dispute was occupied by 1st and 2nd Appellants and

the mother of the 1st Appellant after the demise of their father.

According to the statement made by the 1st Appellant on 16.05.2013 to Baddegama

Police Station, the 1st Appellant had been living in the disputed premises with his

mother and had left the disputed premises on 18.03.2013 after quarrelling with his

mother. Thereafter, his mother had continued to live in the premises in dispute and

later the mother also had left the premises in dispute due to many interruptions

made by the 1st and 2nd Appellants.

Since the Respondent had to keep the premises occupied, the Respondent had

placed a caretaker, namely one T.G. Dayananda, to look after the premises in

question. The 1st Appellant had attacked the said T.G. Dayananda who was looking

after the premises and he had been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at the

Karapitiya Hospital upon sustaining severe injuries. This resulted in a non-occupancy

of the premises in question.

However, the Respondent had padlocked the premises in dispute to keep the 1st and

2nd Appellants away. It is observable that 1st Appellant neither accepted nor denied

the occupancy of the premises in question by the said T.G. Dayananda and the

Appellants had taken a silent position in this regard.

Furthermore, keys to the premises in dispute were not in the possession of the

Appellants throughout this sequence of events and the 1st Appellant himself has

stated that his mother refused to give him the keys to the premises in dispute.

It is worthy to note the statement made by the 1st Appellant on 16.05.2013 to the

Baddegama Police Station;

According to the said statement of the 1st Appellant dated 16.05.2013, it clearly

demonstrates that Appellants were not in actual physical possession of the disputed

premises until the date of the said statement made on 16.05.2013. Furthermore,

the 1st Appellant admitted in his affidavit that he had not been in possession of the

premises in question for more than five months by then.

It is relevant to note that 1st and 2nd Appellants in their affidavit dated 11.12.2013,

expressly admitted that they broke open the padlocks and entered the premises in

dispute on 16.09.2013. In these circumstances, it clearly manifests that

Respondents aunt, mother of the 1st Appellant, had power and control over the

disputed premises to exercise dominion directly or through the Respondent by way

of constructive possession. Hence it is apparent that the Respondent was

dispossessed on 16.09.2013 from the disputed premises.

When the Respondent got to know that the Appellants had broke open the padlocks

on 17.09.2013 and entered the premises in dispute, it amounts to a dispossession of

the Respondent.

After a complaint was made by the Respondent to the Police Station Baddegama on

07.09.2013, he had filed an information on 30.10.2013 under Section 66 (1) of the

Act by way of an affidavit.

The learned High Court Judge has held that Respondent was dispossessed within the

two-month period from the date of filing the information. Thus, the learned

Magistrate had not considered the dispossession of the Respondent in terms of

Section 68 (3) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act and this clearly manifests that

the learned Magistrate has erred in law and fact and decided the dispute in terms

of Section 68 (1) and made the Order in favour of the 1st and 2nd Appellants.

Page 7 of 11

It was argued on behalf of the Appellants that the Respondent was never in

possession of the disputed premises. Respondent has not stated in his affidavit that

he was in possession of the disputed premises in the instant action. Thus,

Respondent has not proved that he ever had possession of the disputed premises.

Court draws the attention to the complaint made by the 2nd Appellant on

17.09.2013. The 2nd Appellant had stated;

,

4 .......................

The said complaint substantiates that Appellants had to leave the disputed premises

as a result of friendly relations with the mother of the 1st Appellant being broken.

It is to be noted that the mother was in possession of the premises after Appellants

left the premises, and this clearly establishes that the mother was in actual

possession of the disputed premises. Thus, the mother had dominion and direct

control over the premises in dispute.

In view of the statement dated 17.09.2013 [2] made by the Complainant-

Petitioner-Respondent Kapila Dharmasiri;

Since the Respondent has not even stated in his affidavit that he was in possession

of the disputed premises, it was the contention of the Appellants that the

Respondent was never in possession of the same. Thus, the Respondent has failed

to prove that he ever had possession of the disputed premises.

Therefore, it was contended by the Appellants that since the Respondent had not

been in possession of the disputed premises, there couldnt have been a

Page 8 of 11

dispossession by the Appellants on 17.09.2013 by the padlocks being broke open and

by entering into the premises.

It is worthy to note that the said Respondent Kapila Dharmasiri has made a complaint

to the Baddegama Police Station on 10.10.2013 stating;

.

. .

.................................................................................................................................................

...................................................................................................................

The Deed of Gift bearing No. 1733 dated 11.03.2013 marked as 1 shows that

Thelikda Gamage Lalitha Charlet, the aunt of the Respondents wife had gifted the

property in dispute to the Respondent Kapila Dharmasiri and his wife, Rasika

Sandamali Dissanayake on 11.03.2013. It is to be noted that the said Thelikda

Gamage Lalitha Charlet had leased out shop premises bearing Nos. 216 and 216

on 02.03.2013 by lease agreement bearing No 2022 [6].

Moreover, the said Respondent Kapila Dharmasiri by lease agreement bearing No.

1792 dated 29.07.2013 [7] and lease agreement bearing No. 1765 dated 26.06.2013

[8] had leased out the shop premises in the ground floor of the disputed property.

Therefore, it is apparent that the said Lalitha Charlotte, the mother of the 1st

Appellant, and the Respondent had the direct control over the said shop premises

and the entire premises including the disputed premises.

However, the learned Magistrate had held with the Appellants and determined the

possession of the instant action as being with the Appellant at the time of instituting

the instant action in terms of Section 68(1) of the Act.

Since the mother of the 1st Appellant and the Respondent had dominion over the

premises in dispute and the control over the entire premises including the premises

in dispute, it is clear that mother of the 1st Appellant and the Respondent had

constructive possession of the premises in dispute. This position is further

substantiated by the evidence adduced on behalf of the Respondent that mother of

the Appellant and Respondent placed T.G. Dayananda as the caretaker to look after

the premises in dispute.

Even though the 1st Appellants mother or the Respondent was not in actual physical

possession of the disputed premises on the day on which the instant action was

Page 9 of 11

instituted by filing the information, it is clear that they had constructive possession

of the premises in dispute.

In view of the Judgment Iqbal vs Majedudeen [1999] 3 SLR 213, the learned Judge

acknowledged possession to be of two kinds.

1. When a person has direct physical control over a thing at a given time actual

possession.

2. When he is not in actual possession, he may have both power and intention

at a given time to exercise dominion or control over a thing either directly or

through another person constructive possession.

In Blacks Law Dictionary 9th Edition, the term constructive possession is defined as

control or dominion over a property without actual possession or custody of it.

When considering the Judgment of Iqbal Vs. Majedudeen and Others [supra], it

appears that Respondent in this appeal had both power and intention at a given time

to exercise dominion or control over the said premises, thus, it can be construed

that Respondent had constructive possession of the premises.

As such, I hold that Respondent had possession of the disputed premises on the date

on which the instant action was filed and the 1st and 2nd Appellants entering the

disputed premises by breaking open the padlocks amounts to dispossession of the

Respondent from the disputed premises. Thus, the learned Magistrate has erred in

law by deciding the instant action under Section 68(1) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act.

However, it was revealed in evidence that belongings of the Appellants were also in

the disputed premises on the date relevant and material to the instant action. The

Appellants too can argue that they had constructive possession over the property in

dispute.

In such a situation where the constructive possession of the premises in dispute

appears to be with both the Appellants and the Respondent and the evidence with

regard to possession is clearly balanced, question of possession has to be determined

by the presumption of possession. Since the presumption of possession flows from

the title to the property, title holder of the property in dispute will get the benefit

of possession in Section 66 matters under the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

Page 10 of 11

Since the 1st Respondent is the owner of the disputed premises, the learned High

Court Judge has been correct in deciding the possession of the property in dispute

in favour of the 1st Respondent.

The only instance when evidence as to title can be considered in a Section 66 case

is when the possession of both parties is balanced. In the case of Ponnamperuma

Arachchige Sunil Kumara Vs. Nanayakkarawasam Patudoowe Vidanalage

Gnanawathie CA PHC 207/2006 C.A.M. 13.02.2017, Madawala J. held, it is

generally accepted that, the evidence in relation to title and right of possession

cannot be considered in a Section 66 action. However, in an instance where the

evidence as to possession is clearly balanced, the title will become important as the

presumption of possession will benefit the party who brings in evidence of title to

the Section 66 action.

Since it is evident that Respondent and his wife owns the entire premises including

the disputed premises, possession with regard to the dispute in the instant action is

in favour of the Respondent. It is significant to note the only instance when Court

can consider the title of the disputed property to determine the possession under

Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, is when the evidence as to

possession is clearly balanced between parties and presumption of possession comes

into play.

The said principle was observed by Sharvananda J. in Ramalingam Vs. Thangarajah

[1982 SLR 693 at page 699];

He is not to decide any question of title or right to possession of the parties

to the land. Evidence bearing on title can be considered only when the

evidence as to possession is clearly balanced and the presumption of

possession which flows from title may tilt the balance in favour of the owner

and help in deciding the question of possession

Therefore, it is apparent that learned High Court Judge has been correct in deciding

the possession of the disputed premises under Section 68(3) in favour of the

Respondent.

Court observes that although the learned High Court Judge has come to the correct

conclusion and decided the dispute in terms of Section 68(3) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act, learned High Court Judge has not reasoned out as to how he had

Page 11 of 11

come to the said conclusion. It is both a right and an entitlement to know how and

why a Judgment is rendered in favour or why it is not. Thus, the Judges ought to be

mindful of the need to provide sufficient reasons to substantiate his determination.

Therefore, we see no reason to interfere with the Order of the learned High Court

Judge dated 28.12.2018. Thus, we set aside the Order of the learned Magistrate

dated 27.10.2014.

Hence, the appeal of the 1st and 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Appellants is dismissed

with tax cost.
