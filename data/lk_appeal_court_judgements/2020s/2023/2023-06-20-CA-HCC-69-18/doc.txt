B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

This is an appeal by the Accused Appellant (here in after referred to as the

Accused) on being aggrieved by his conviction and the sentence by the learned High Court

Judge of Colombo.

The Accused was indicted before the High Court of Colombo for having in his

possession 3.52 grams of Diacetylmorphine, commonly known as Heroin and trafficking

the said quantity of Heroin on 29th December 2013, which were offenses punishable under

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance No. 13 of 1984 (as amended).

The prosecution led evidence of 6 witnesses including the government analyst. The

Accused made a dock statement. The Learned High Court Judge found the Accused guilty

on first count, convicted and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by said judgment this appeal was preferred by the Accused.

Page 3 of 7

The following grounds of appeal were urged by the learned counsel for the Accused.

The Items of evidence are not sufficient to prove the prosecutions case against the

appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

The Rejection of the dock statement is wrongful and the learned judge of the high

court has failed to correctly apply the principles governing the evaluation of a dock

statement.

Facts in brief as per evidence led by the prosecution.

According to the evidence of PW1, namely PI Chandana Ranasinghe, then OIC of

Vice Division of the Western Province of Colombo Crimes Division (commonly known as

CCD), on the day in question that is 29th of December 2013 at 13.50, he along with

seven other officers have proceeded to 56 Watta, an area known for drug peddling and

trafficking in a van belonging to CCD. According to PW1 this was done, as part of their

daily routine which PW1 describes as '. The officers were

all dressed in civil attire, except for PW1 who was in his uniform.

They arrived at Musjeed Place and proceeded by foot to 56 Watta, where he noticed

a person coming from a house. When this person saw the officers, he tried to re-enter the

house. However, it appeared that the door was locked, as that person was seen struggling

to reopen the door. PW1 describes the same in the following words (On page 49 of the

Brief proceedings dated 24/07/2015);

- .

. .

When PW1 saw that person was panicking he got suspicious and ran towards him.

In the meantime, a woman opened the said door and that person tried to go inside. Seeing

this PC 61072 entered the house, obstructing that person from entering and that woman

from closing the door. PW1 searched the person at the doorway. He found an electronic

scale and a pink cellophane bag containing brown powder in his shirt pocket. When PW1

inspected the contents in the bag through his experience, he suspected it to be Heroin.

Page 4 of 7

The Accused was arrested at 14.25 and the cellophane bag was retained by PW1.

He then searched the house with PS 10757 Fonseka. Several persons were found inside

the house. No other illegal substance was discovered inside the house. Thereafter, they

proceeded to Dedigama Pawn Center to weigh the heroin at around 15.30. This was done

by PW1 in the presence of PS 10757 Fonseka and the Accused. When weighed with the

cellophane bag, the weight of the parcel was recorded as 25.1g. The cellophane bag and

the scale were then put inside different envelopes and sealed. Thereafter, they arrived at

CCD upon which, the Accused along with the production and the scale were handed over

to PS 49692 Thushara. The production was entered into the PR book and sent to the

government analyst.

PW3, namely PC 10757 Fonseka in his evidence corroborated with the version of

PW1.

In his dock statement, the Accused has taken the position that he was arrested by

four police officers who came to his house while he was taking a nap. He was put in a van

and taken to Dematagoda Police Station. At the station, a statement was taken from the

Accused and he was asked to sign some papers. He further claims that the Prosecution

version is highly improbable pointing out the unlikeliness of going out in the daytime with

illegal drugs in his possession in such a crowded area which was commonly scouted by

the Police.

The first ground of appeal is the insufficiency in Prosecutions evidence to create

reasonable doubt. Therefore, this Court must consider whether the Prosecution has

proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. Before dealing further, it must be noted that

this Court is mindful that the Learned High Court Judge had the opportunity to see and

hear the witnesses. In the instant case, after observing demeanour and deportment of

PW1 and PW3 the Learned High Court Judge has made the following remarks. (On page

265 of the Brief judgement dated 20/03/2018);

In evaluating the evidence of PW1 and PW3 the learned Trial Judge has considered

the consistency of their evidence. The learned Judge further satisfied himself on the

inward journey to the government analyst PW13. As such, there is no break in the chain

of custody of the productions, nor is there any omission or contradiction in the

Prosecutions narration of events marked by the Defence.

We are mindful that the arrest took place while the officers were on their daily

routine. According to the evidence of PW1 he got suspicious of the way the accused

behaved. That is to say, after seeing the police officers he turned and tried to re-enter the

house. We are mindful of the fact that the arrest of the Accused was not pre-planned or is

a result of a tipoff, but rather it was his suspicious conduct observed by PW1 which led

to the search. In relation to this particular point, the events which transpired in Siddick

v. The Republic of Sri Lanka [2005] 1 SLR 383 come to our mind. In the said case, the

main witness (who was a customs officer) had searched the Accused on suspicion raised

by the fact that the accused was wearing ill-matching shoes. To reiterate the words of his

Lordship Imam J., Nazeer in his evidence stated that what roused his suspicion was that

the Accused at the time of detection was attired in a dark blue suit and wore ill-matching

pair of brown shoes. by virtue of his job was entrusted to question and check suspicious

looking persons, by virtue of which he arrested the Appellant.

In the light of the version taken up by the Defence which is that the Accused was

framed, the failure to address the vital details in the events renders their case highly

untrustworthy. For instance, the weighing machine, purportedly recovered from the

possession of the Accused is never addressed in the version of the Defence. Further, as

the Defence contends in the cross-examination of PW1 the Heroin was found in a public

toilet nearby, which as the learned High Court Judge correctly points out, the Accused

would have had no way of knowing by the manner he was arrested. In the eyes of this

Court, these gaps do not spark any suspicion in the prosecution case.

The other point taken by the Defence is that the learned High Court Judge has not

considered the dock statement. In assessing the evidentiary value of a dock statement,

this Court is guided by the celebrated judgment of Queen v. Kularatne 71 NLR 529 at

p.551;

Page 6 of 7

We are in respectful agreement, and are of the view that such a statement must be looked

upon as evidence subject to the infirmity that the Accused had deliberately refrained from

giving sworn testimony, and the jury must be so informed. But the jury must also be

directed that,

(a) If the dock statement is believed, it must be acted upon to.

(b) If it raised a reasonable doubt in their minds about the case of the prosecution,

the defence must succeed. and

(c) It must not be used against another accused.

With the above dictum in mind, this Court has to consider whether the learned

High Court Judge has rightly evaluated the dock statement. In this regard, the relevant

excerpt from the judgement is reproduced below (On page 268 of Brief judgement dated

20/03/2018);

In review of this excerpt, we are of the view that the learned High Court Judge has

rightly considered the dock statement and his Defence. We hold that the learned Trial

Judge has correctly concluded that the dock statement has not created any reasonable

doubt in the evidence of the Prosecution.

Additionally, the Accused has not been successful in establishing any of the limbs

set out in the dictum of Shah J. in the case of Kirpal Singh v The State of Uttar Pradesh

AIR (1965) SC 712, which was insisted upon by our courts. For the purpose of

convenience, it is pertinent to set out the said dictum of Shah J;

Page 7 of 7

"The conclusion recorded by the Court of First Instance and affirmed by the High

Court is based upon appreciation of evidence and no question of law arises therefrom.

Normally this Court does not proceed to review the evidence in appeals in criminal cases,

unless the trial is vitiated by some illegality or irregularity of procedure or the trial is

held in a manner violative of the rules of natural justice resulting in an unfair trial or

unless the judgment under appeal has resulted in gross miscarriage of justice. "

Considering the same, this Court is of the view that the Accused has failed to

satisfy us of any such gross miscarriage of justice. Therefore, we see no reason to interfere

with the judgement dated 20th March 2018. The conviction and the sentence are affirmed,

and the appeal is accordingly dismissed.
