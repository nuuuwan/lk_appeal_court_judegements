The petitioner has filed this writ application seeking a writ of certiorari

quashing a decision if any of the first respondent Council to place any

form of obstruction on the undefined boundary in the surveyor plan

marked X3 with the petition. The petitioner has also sought a writ of

prohibition on the first respondent and/or its agents and/or its

servants from placing any form of obstruction on the undefined

boundary in the surveyor plan marked X3.

Briefly, the facts relating to this application are that there is a roadway

in front of the petitioners property. Across the road way, there is a

forest reserve namely Dunumadalawa. The petitioner stated that she

came to know that a fence was about to be erected around the area in

the forest reserve that she could see from her property. The instant

application for writs has been filed to prevent a fence been erected

around the forest reserve. The petitioner complains that the reason for

erecting a fence is to ruin the salubrious environment enjoyed by the

petitioner and/or to harass the petitioner due to the political affiliations

of the petitioners son.

The statements of objections have been filed on behalf of 1st, 2nd, 3rd,

and 4th respondents, 6th respondent, 7th respondent and 8th

respondent. At the hearing of this application, the learned Presidents

Counsel for the petitioner, the Counsel for the 1st to 4th respondents,

and the learned Counsel for the 7th respondent made oral submissions.

The learned State Counsel appeared for the 5th, 6th, and 8th respondents

informed the Court that she does not intend to make submissions as

no relief has been sought against the 5th 6th, and 8th respondents.

The learned counsel for the 7th respondent raised an objection that this

application could not be maintained because there is no decision to

quash. In addition, the learned counsel for the 7th respondent

contended that there is no any form of obstruction although the

petitioner sought a writ of certiorari and prohibition to prevent placing

any form of obstruction. Accordingly, the learned counsel for the 7th

respondent contended that the petitioner could not maintain this

application.

In R v. Paddington Valuation Officer - (1966) 1 QB 380, Lord

Denning observed that the Court would not listen, of course to a mere

busybody who was interfering in things which did not concern him. But

it will listen to anyone whose interests are affected by what has been

done. Although the erection of the fence has no effect on petitioners

land, the petitioner states that her interests are affected due to the issue

raised in this application.

In perusing the prayer to the petition, it is clear that the petitioner

sought to quash the decision, if any, of the 1st respondent Council to

place any obstruction on the undefined boundary. Therefore, it appears

that the petitioner is not certain whether there is a decision to place

any form of obstruction on the boundary of the forest reserve. However,

the learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner stated at the hearing

that the petitioner seeks to quash the decision contain in 1R-12. As

Page 5 of 12

correctly pointed out by the learned Counsel for the 7th respondent,

1R-12 contains no decision but only a recommendation of the

subcommittee. Now the question arises whether a writ can be issued to

quash a recommendation which was indicated only at the stage of

arguments, in the absence of a decision to be quashed as prayed for in

the petition.

Another matter to be considered is that the petitioner has sought to

quash the decision if any to place any obstruction on an undefined

boundary and to prohibit placing any obstruction on the boundary.

Although the petitioner stated that it is an undefined boundary, it is

stated in paragraph 8 of the statement of objections tendered by the 1st

to 4th respondents that the Dunumadalawa forest reservation has a

clear boundary as depicted in Preliminary plan No. 6980, dated 26th

September 1909. However, the said plan has not been produced as a

document of this case.

Undisputedly, the petitioners property does not extend beyond the

roadway. Her property extends only up to the road. According to

document 1R-12, the security fence would be erected 15 feet from the

edge of that road towards forest reserve. Also, it is transpired from

documents 1R-6, 1R-7, and 1R-10 that, the said road is expected to be

developed as 30 feet wide road by acquiring 15 feet from both sides from

the center of the road. However, as per the report marked 1R-12, it has

been recommended to erect the security fence 15 feet from the opposite

edge (opposite edge to the boundary of the petitioners property) of the

road. Therefore, it is apparent that the area where the security fence is

expected to be erected has no connection with the petitioners property

or the boundaries of the petitioners property. Even if the said boundary

is undefined, the said fact is irrelevant to the dispute presented by the

petitioner.

Page 6 of 12

In the circumstances, it must be considered the obstruction about

which the petitioner complains, because erecting a fence on the

boundary of the forest reserve would only be an obstruction to freely

entering the forest from anywhere and not an obstruction to petitioners

property or rights attached to the petitioners property. Therefore, the

only obstruction that the petitioner claims can be his right to view the

forest reserve without a fence.

Now, it has to be considered whether the right of scenery or right of view

is a right recognized in our law. In Abraham Silva v. Chandrawimala

(1958) 61 N.L.R 348, it has been commented as follows: Under our

law, servitudes which were not known in the times of the Roman-Dutch

Law writers can be granted or acquired. The Roman-Dutch Law is not

a static system of law. The petitioners application is based on the right

of view. Therefore, it has to be considered whether the petitioner has

the right to see the forest reserve without a fence? Although there are

instances where the right to light and the right to air have been granted

as servitudal rights in our country, no decision has been found where

the right of view or the right to scenery has been granted. Parties have

been given the opportunity to file the judicial authorities regarding the

matters that arose in the course of the arguments but the petitioner did

not submit any judicial authority where the right of view has been

granted as a right in our country.

Before dealing with the issue of the right of view of the petitioner, I wish

to consider what legal authority the 1st respondent has to erect a

security fence. The contention of the learned counsel for the 1st to 4th

respondents was that the 1st respondent is empowered by law to erect

a security fence and he has taken steps to erect the fence after adopting

the correct legal procedure.

According to section 58 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance, It shall

be lawful for the proper officer of any Municipal Council to put up or make

Page 7 of 12

fences, hedges, ditches, drains, or banks by the side of any street within

the Municipality, whenever to him it shall appear necessary, and the

owner or occupier of each land adjoining such fences, hedges, ditches,

drains, or banks shall and he is hereby required to keep them in good

and substantial repair and order. Therefore, if there is a necessity, the

1st respondent has the power to erect a fence on the side of any street.

As stated in paragraph 11 of the statement of objections filed by the 1st

to 4th respondents, the Public Petitions Committee of the Parliament

made its decision on 31.07.2018 [X-5(b)] to allocate 15 feet from the

center of the road to either side of the road to be utilized and developed

as the road. It is stated in paragraph 12 of the said statement of

objections that the petitioner continued to unlawfully fill the forest

reserve by dumping soil and the reservoir officer of the Dunumadalawa

water tanks tendered his observations to the water works engineer to

take steps to prevent further environmental destruction to be caused

by the petitioner and another. In this situation, necessary

communications were exchanged between the respondents and

subsequently, the 2nd respondent issued a letter dated 13.05.2019

marked 1R-9 to the 6th respondent to specifically inform the extent of

land required from the forest reserve for the 30 feet width of the road to

be developed. As per the letter 1R-11, the Central Environmental

Authority also had received a complaint against the unlawful and illegal

dumping of soil to the forest reserve. It is also stated in the letter

1R-11, that the Central Environmental Authority directed the 1st

respondent to take necessary action to stop the said unlawful and illegal

act of dumping soil. After carrying out a field inspection, considering

the decisions of the Public Petitions Committee and the directions of

the Central Environment Authority, a recommendation was made to

exclude 15 feet from the edge of the road towards the forest reserve for

the road and erect a security fence along the border of the forest as

reflects from the report 1R-12. Therefore, the decision to erect a fence

Page 8 of 12

between the boundary of the road and the reserve forest has been taken

with legal authority after following the correct legal procedure.

It is also vital to be noted that the constitution in Chapter VI under

Directive Principles of State Policy and fundamental Duties states that

the State shall protect, preserve and improve the environment for the

benefit of the community (Article 27(14)) and Article 28 refers to the

fundamental duty upon every person to protect nature and conserve its

riches as it was held in Watte Gedara Wijebanda v. Conservator

General of Forests and Others (2009) 1 Sri. L.R 337.

In addition, the petitioner cannot complain that the fence would be

erected to harass her due to the political affiliations of the son of the

petitioner especially because of the reason that it was decided to erect

the fence 15 feet from the edge of the road although it was decided

initially to allocate 15 feet from the center of the road to either side of

the road when developing the road. According to the initial decision, the

1st respondent could erect the fence 15 feet from the center of the road

without excluding 15 feet from the edge of the road towards the forest.

Erecting the fence 15 feet from the edge of the road would result in the

fence being erected further away from the petitioners land.

Now, the only issue that remains to be considered is whether the

petitioner has a right to obtain a writ to stop erecting a fence on the

boundary of the road and forest reserve for the reason of her right of

view being obstructed.

In the absence of local decisions, I would like to consider the decisions

of two foreign cases in which the right of view has been recognized as a

legal right. Those two cases show the limited circumstances where the

right of view can be granted.

The case of Dennis v Davies [2009] EWCA Civ 1081 (22 October 2009)

concerned a property dispute regarding a modern development,

adjacent to the river Thames, which had been specifically designed, and

sold, on the basis that each property had a river view. The owner of one

of the riverside houses decided to build an extension that would

obstruct the views of the river from neighbouring properties within the

development. Under the traditional law, the neighbouring owners had

lost their view, not only potentially damaging property values, but also

providing a precedent for other properties being developed and thus

blocking other river views.

However, all the property owners in the development were subject to

and had the benefit of, a specific covenant that they would not cause a

nuisance or annoyance to their neighbours. The first part of that

covenant was of no help because there was no nuisance, however, the

part concerning annoyance was considered to be applicable and, on

that basis, the development was blocked.

This is a fairly exceptional circumstance and the Court took into

account the fact that this property development had been designed so

that each and every property would benefit from the river view.

Furthermore, the wide covenant that applied to each property ensured

that neighbouring owners should not cause annoyance to each other.

Although the general position relating to the English Law is that there

is no right to a view, the aforesaid decision is an exception. Salient

aspects in this case are that the blocks of land were sold on the basis

that each property had a river view. In addition, all the property owners

in the development were subject to a specific covenant that they would

not cause a nuisance or annoyance to their naighbours. The court

observed that the extension that would obstruct the view of the river

would cause an annoyance specified in the covenant among the

Page 10 of 12

property owners. On this ground, it was decided that the right to a view

was there.

However, in the case at hand, there was no agreement or covenant

whatsoever between the petitioner and the 1st respondent or any official

or person attached to the duties and functions of the Kandy Municipal

Council or the forest reserve. The petitioner states that she purchased

the property considering the salubrious surrounding and the natural

beauty of the location. However, it was only the petitioners will and

desire. The petitioner has not entered into any agreement or covenant

with anyone or any institution in order to enjoy the salubrious

surroundings and natural beauty. Especially, the 1st respondent had

no agreement whatsoever with the petitioner. In the circumstances, the

petitioner can never be considered to be entitled to an obligation on the

part of the respondents not to erect a fence on the boundary of a public

road or a forest reserve.

On the other hand, the petitioners right of view would not be totally

obstructed by erecting a fence. She can see the forest reserve very well

from her property even if a fence is erected on the boundary. Therefore,

the circumstances of the aforesaid case are different from the case

before us and thus, the said decision of the English Court could not be

applied to the instant action.

In considering the modern developments in the Roman Dutch Law,

following decision of South African Court on the right of a property

owner to have a particular view or scenery unobstructed is also worth

discussing at this juncture. In Baartman v Stubbs and Others -

(15523/2013) [2015] ZAWCHC 29, the issue relating to the case was

obstructing the sea view by a planted olive tree. The court decided that

the right to an unrestricted view does not automatically vest in terms

of the common law and that the appropriate manner in which to secure

such a right is by the registration of a servitude against the title deeds

Page 11 of 12

of the properties in the Deeds Registry. As there was a condition in the

title deed that unobstructed view of the sea is to be provided and it was

there at the time of the creation of the servitude, the court ordered the

servient tenement owner to trim the wild olive tree in line with the

servitude.

Therefore, in the above South African case also the right of view was

given because that was a condition specified in the title deed and thus

servitudal right has been created. In the case at hand, the right of view

has not been given to the petitioner by her title deed or by any other

legally acceptable document.

It is apparent from the aforementioned two cases that the right of view

is recognized only in exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, in those

cases, the right of view of the petitioners was granted against

respondents who were standing in the capacity of neighbouring

property owners. In the said instances, the petitioners had a legitimate

claim under specific circumstances that such neighbouring property

owners were prohibited from obstructing the scenery or the view of the

petitioners. In the case before us, there was no assurance, promise, or

at least a representation by the relevant state authorities that they

would never put up a fence for the demarcation of the boundary of the

road. Unlike the respondents in the aforementioned cases, who were

held to be under such an obligation, the petitioner in this case has no

justifiable reason or ground to expect such an obligation on the part of

respondents who stand in the capacity of state institutions carrying out

public functions.

For the reasons stated above, I hold that the petitioner is not entitled to

ask for a writ of certiorari or prohibition as prayed for in the petition on

the ground that she does not want to see a fence around the reserve

forest in front of her property. The petitioner cannot be considered to

have a legitimate expectation that the proper authority would never

Page 12 of 12

erect a boundary fence, which it is legally empowered to do for the

reasons stated above.

Accordingly, the application for writs of certiorari and prohibition is

dismissed with costs fixed at Rs.25,000/-
