Written Submissions: Petitioner - 10.01.2023

Respondents- 02.01.2023

Decided on : 30.01.2023

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioners in the instant Application seek for a mandate in the nature of a writ of

Certiorari quashing the Gazette Notification No.2237 dated 16.07.2021, marked P18, by

which applications have been called to conduct the examination to recruit to the post of

Revenue Inspectors to the Revenue Inspection Service in Local Government Institutions

of the Central Province. The Scheme of Recruitment (SOR) dated 20.06.2018, marked

P9, is also sought to be quashed by way of a writ of Certiorari.

The Petitioners contend that the SOR, marked P9, is contrary to the Public

Administration Circulars No. 06/2006 and 03/2016 and the Guidelines issued by the

Public Service Commission in relation to the preparation of Schemes of Recruitment.

The 1st, 4th, 7th, 16th to 19th, 21st, 24th, 28th and 29th Respondents (Respondents) raising a

preliminary objection assert that the subject matter of this Application falls within the

Jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Central Province in terms of Article

154P(4) of the Constitution and as such this Court has no jurisdiction to hear and

determine this Application. In addition, the Respondents also claim that the Petitioners

are guilty of laches.

Page 7 of 9

Based on the precedent laid down in my order in Senaka Sebidra Lewis vs. D.G. Ajith

Priyantha and others CA/WRIT/368/2021 decided on 14.09.2022 in which the same

preliminary objection has been raised on identical issues, I take the view that this Court

has the Jurisdiction to hear and determine this Application. At this stage, I need to

examine whether the instant Application should be heard and determined by this Court

and also whether the preliminary objection should be dealt with at this stage.

As pleaded by the Petitioners, some other members of the Union of Revenue Inspectors

of Local Government Service (1st Petitioner) have filed an application bearing case No.

07/2021 in the Provincial High Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy seeking

for a Writ quashing (a) the Scheme of Recruitment dated 20.06.2018, (b) Gazette

Notification No. 2237 dated 16.07.2021 and (c) the decisions taken thereto. The same

Gazette Notification and the SOR are being impugned in the instant Application as well.

A copy of the Petition of the said case No. 07/2021 is marked as P19. The learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners has informed this Court that the Provincial High

Court had issued even an interim relief in the said Case No. 07/2021. (vide-Journal entry

of 24.05.2022)

The provisions of Section 12 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act

No. 19 of 1990 are vital to consider whether this matter should be taken up for hearing

before this Court, after formally issuing notice on the Respondents.

Section 12 (a);

Where any appeal or application is filed in the Court of Appeal and an appeal or

application in respect of the same matter has been filed in a High Court established

by Article 154P of the Constitution invoking jurisdiction vested in that Court by

paragraph (3) (b) or (4) of Article 154P of the Constitution, within the time allowed

for the filing of such appeal of application, and the hearing of such appeal or

application by such High Court has not commenced, the Court of Appeal may

proceed to hear and determine such appeal or application or where it considers it

expedient to do so, direct such High Court to hear and determine such appeal or

application:

Page 8 of 9

Proviso to Section 12(a);

Provided, however, that where any appeal or application which is within the

jurisdiction of a High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution is filed

in the Court of Appeal, the Court of Appeal may if it considers it expedient to do

so, order that such appeal or application be transferred to such High Court and

such High Court shall hear and determine such appeal or application.

Now, it is important to draw the attention to the paragraph 14 and 16 of the written

submissions filed on behalf of the Petitioners.

Paragraph 14;

It is respectfully submitted that when the matter came up before Your Lordships Court on

09th August 2022, learned Presidents Counsel on behalf of the Petitioners, requested that the

matter be kept alive in the event a jurisdictional issue arose as a result of the National Salaries

and Cadre Commission being made party in the Provincial High Court.

Paragraph 16;

In the said circumstances it is respectfully submitted that the present application before Your

Lordships Court be kept alive and if necessary fixed for support in the future.

It is abundantly clear that the Respondents of the instant Application have taken up the

position that the subject matter of the instant Application falls within the jurisdiction of

the Provincial High Court of the Central Province. The Secretary to the National Pay

Commission is the 6th Respondent in the said case No. 07/2021. Based on the reason

expressed by the Petitioners as to why this Application should be maintained and the stand

taken by the Respondents upon the jurisdictional question, I see no reason to take up this

matter for hearing in this Court or to consider on issuance of formal notice at this stage.

Taking in to consideration the circumstances of the whole case and also the effect of the

above provisions in Section 12 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions)

Act, I hold that this is a fit case to be transferred to the High Court of the Uva Province,

holden in Badulla. I have exercised my discretion to arrive at the said conclusion by

reasons of the circumstances of this case and also due to the reason which is, in my

opinion, it is expedient to hear and determine this case in the Provincial High Court.

Page 9 of 9

In arriving at the above conclusions this Court was guided by the principles enunciated in

the cases of Court of Appeal Application No. 736/93, decided on 12.10.1993; Senaka Sebidra

Lewis vs. D.G. Ajith Priyantha and others, CA/WRIT/368/2021 decided on 14.09.2022;

Adasuriya Mudiyanselage Rohana Bandara vs. The Governor, Wayamba Provincial Council,

Kurunegala CA/Writ/762/08 decided on 19.05.2015; Weragama vs. Eksath Lanka Wathu

Kamkaru Samithiya and others (1994) 1 Sri. L.R. 293; Kamalawathie and others vs. The

Provincial Public Service Commission, North-Western Province and others (2001) 1 Sri. L.R. 1;

Sunil Chandra Kumar vs. Veloo (2001) 3 Sri. L.R. 911; Madduma Banda vs. Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarian Services and another (2003) 2 Sri. L.R 80; Kalu Arachchige Allen

Nona vs. Sunil Weerasinghe, Commissioner of Agrarian Development and others

CA/Writ/23/2013 decided on 10.06.2016; Nilwala Vidulibala Company (Pvt) Ltd. vs.

Kotapala Pradeshiya Sabha and others (2005) 1 Sri. L.R. 296 and Ramalingam vs.

Parameswary and others (2000) 2 Sri. L.R. 340.

In the circumstances, the Application is transferred to the High Court of the Central

Province, holden in Kandy. Thus, the Hon. High Court Judge is directed to hear and

determine this Application after making an appropriate order at the initial stage on the

issuance of notice and the interim relief as prayed for by the Petitioners. Further, the Hon.

High Court Judge may consider the other preliminary objections raised by the

Respondents at an appropriate stage.
