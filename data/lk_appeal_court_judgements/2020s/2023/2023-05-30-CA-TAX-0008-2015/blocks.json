Section 130 provides that the entry of the name of a person in the share register as holder of a share shall be prima facie evidence that the title to the share is vested in that person. But there is no presumption of that kind for the annual report. It is therefore apparent that the Appellant failed to produce the most essential documents in support of its claim.

Although the dispute may be on the reasons given by the Assessor for rejecting the return and making an assessment, yet, the onus of disproving the estimate lies on the tax payer.

    "text": "The Respondents argument is that accumulated losses amounting to Rs. 737,014,909.22 constitutes a negative retain earning and should be treated as a reserve. The Appellant disputed this position. The Assessor has worked out the difference between the negative retained earnings (accumulated losses) amounting to 737,014,909.22 and the issued share capital of Rs.263,812,452.39 as equity of Rs. 437,202,456,8320. Therefore, the issue to be determined by this Court is whether the negative retain earnings (accumulated losses) constitute a reserve. The term reserve is not defined in the IR Act. Section 26 (1)(x)(iii) only states that reserves do not include reserves from the revaluation of any asset. The Appellant cited the Blacks Law Dictionary21 where the term reserve is defined to mean to keep back, retain, keeping, store for future or special use, and to retain or hold over to future time.",
