Before : Menaka Wijesundera, J.

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

Counsel : Neranjan Jayasinghe with Harshana Ananda for the Accused-

Appellant.

Janaka Bandara, D.S.G for the State.

Decided on : 05/10/2023.

Menaka Wijesundera, J.

The instant appeal has been filed to set aside the Judgment dated 04/11/2019.

The Accused-Appellant( hereinafter referred to as the Appellant ) had been indicted in the

High Court of Panadura for being in possession and trafficking of 23.96 grams of heroin under

the Provision of Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drug Ordinance Act No. 13 of 1984.

When the trail was taken up the Accused- Appellant had pleaded not guilty and had faced

the trial. Upon the conclusion of the trial, the Appellant had been convicted and life

imprisonment had been ordered.

When the matter was taken up for argument, the Counsel appearing for the Accused-

Appellant stated that the Judgment of the Trial Judge is not in accordance with Section

283(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code, because he has not specified as to which

offence or offences he has convicted and sentenced the Appellant.

The learned Deputy solicitor General conceded to this position.

3

As such, we are of the opinion, that it is a serious misdirection by the Trial Judge which

warrants a re-trial of the matter.

As such, the instant Appeal is allowed and we set aside the conviction and the sentence

entered by the trial Judge and directs the Registrar of this Court to send the case record back

to the High Court for re-trial.

The Prison Authorities are directed to produce the Accused-Appellant before the relevant

High Court upon receiving notice by the High Court.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

I agree.
