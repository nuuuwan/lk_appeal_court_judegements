Judgment

It appears that the Plaintiff instituted action bearing no 421/P in the District Court of Panadura

to Partition an allotment of land called Lot D of Willorawatte described in the schedule to the

Plaint and also depicted as Lot D in plan bearing no 5402 dated 30.03.1940. 1st to 8th

Defendants filed their statements of claim and thereafter, the trial commenced on nine points of

contest of which 1st to 4th points of contest were proposed by the Plaintiff and points of contest

no 5th - 9th were proposed by the Defendants.

Apparently, Plaintiff had adduced evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff and 4th Defendant had given

evidence on behalf of the Defendants.

However, at the end of the trial the Learned District Judge answered the said points of contest

no 1,2,3 in the affirmative and 4,5,7 points of contest were answered as not proven and 6th and

9th points of contest were answered in the negative. It is interesting to note that 8th point of

contest was decided in the affirmative. However, the learned District judge held in favour of the

Plaintiff by judgement dated 17.08.2000 and ordered to enter the interlocutory decree

accordingly.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment 4th to 11th Defendant-Appellants have preferred this

Appeal seeking to set aside the judgment dated 17.08.2000 and sought relief prayed in prayer

to the statements of claim of the Defendant-Appellants.

According to the evidence of the Plaintiff the corpus sought to be partitioned is Lot D a portion

of land allotted in the final partition decree in the District Court of Colombo case bearing no 617

Partition and the said Lot D is depicted in the final partition plan bearing no 5402 dated

03.03.1940 marked as P2.

When this matter was taken up for trial on 24.01.1996, it was recorded as an admission that

the corpus sought to be partitioned in the instant action is depicted as Lot D in final partition

plan bearing no. 5402 dated 30.03.1940 prepared by M. L. De Silva Licensed Surveyor.

The said final partition decree was marked and produced in evidence as P1. The said Lot D

was allocated to 4th Defendant in the said partition action bearing no 617/P in the District Court

of Colombo, namely Richard Vincent Mendis of Laxapathiya-Moratuwa.

The said lot D was described in the final Partition decree as follows, Lot D is bounded on the,

North: by Lot E

East: by Panadura River

South: by Kahatagahawatte formerly of B.D. Mendis

West: by Lot C

in the extent of Acres - 0, Roods - 0 and Perches - 29.85

It is to be noted that the schedule of the Plaint described the same land Lot D which was sought

to be partitioned.

The said Richard Vincent Mendis became entitled to Lot D in plan bearing no 5402 marked as

P2 and produced in evidence by virtue of final partition decree P1 in case bearing 617/P.

The Plaintiff adduced evidence that the said Richard Vincent Mendis has transferred his rights

to Martheles Caldera father of the Plaintiff by deed bearing no. 2272 dated 01.06.1945 marked

as P3 and produced in evidence.

Subsequently, Martheles Caldera died leaving his four children namely Yasmin Hendry, Mulin

Ignal, Rekey Margaret and Seulet Eanet (the Plaintiff).

The said Yasmin Hendry, Mulin Ignal and Henley Margaret transferred their rights to their sister

Seulet Earnet, the Plaintiff by deed bearing no 3330 dated 02.07.1991 marked as [P4],

whereupon the Plaintiff became entitled to the entirety of Lot D depicted in plan bearing no

5402 [P2].

The Plaintiff after retaining undivided 1/3rd of said Lot D for herself, had transferred the

balance undivided 2/3rd to her two children Ranjani Mallika, the 1st Defendant and Sudharma

Srimathi, the 2nd Defendant, by virtue of deed bearing no 1671 dated 21.02.1992 11.

Therefore, the Plaintiff, 1st Defendant and 2nd Defendant became entitled for 1/3rd each of the

corpus.

However, it was brought to the notice on behalf of the 4th to 11th Defendant-Appellants that the

said deeds marked as P3, P4 and 11 are not contained in the appeal brief.

Page 6 of 12

As such, counsel for the 1st -8th Defendant-Appellants urged Court that the said deeds marked

as P3, P4 and 11 pertain to the title of the Plaintiff have failed to reach the record of the case

warrants a dismissal of the Plaintiffs case on this ground alone.

Court observes that these three deeds P3, P4, and 11 marked in evidence are not in the appeal

brief.

However, it is pertinent to note, according to proceedings dated 24.03.1998 the said deeds P3,

P4 and 11 had been marked by the Plaintiff in evidence without any objection by the

Defendants.

Since the Defendant-Appellants had not challenged those deeds and as the said deeds were not

marked subject to proof, the deeds P3, P4 and 11 are deemed to be admitted by the contesting

Defendants.

It is to be noted that the plaintiff has listed these three deeds bearing nos 2272 dated 01.06.1945

[P3], 3330 dated 02.07.1991 [P4] and 1671 dated 21.02.1992 21.02.1992 [11] in the list of

witnesses and documents dated 29.12.1995.

The Plaintiff's evidence was concluded, and the Plaintiff case was closed on 19.05.1999 and at

the closure of the Plaintiff's case, it was informed that the Plaintiffs case is being closed by

marking documents 1, 2, 3, and 4.

On perusing the judgment of the learned District Judge, it is seen that the learned District Judge

had considered the final partition plan [P2] and the final partition decree [P1] in case bearing

no D.C Colombo 617/Partition and also deeds marked as P3 and P4.

Court observed that deed bearing no 1671 dated 01.02.1992 marked as 11, which is the deed

that plaintiff gifted 1/3rd each to her children the 1st and the 2nd Defendants, had not been

mentioned as 11 at the closure of the Plaintiffs case. Nevertheless, it is in evidence that,

It seems that the contesting Defendants had not challenged the said deed 11 as well and it was

also marked without any objection. Thus, it can be considered that 11 is admissible in evidence

for the purpose of proving the pedigree of the Plaintiff.

Therefore, it clearly shows that although the learned District Judge had not referred to deed 11

in his judgment, it seems to be an omission. However, the learned District Judge had come to the

correct findings of fact and had come to the correct conclusion that the Plaintiff has proved her

pedigree and therefore the Plaintiff, 1st and 2nd Defendants are entitled to equal shares of the

corpus.

However, it was the contention of the Defendant-Appellants that,

the learned District Judge had not properly evaluated the evidence adduced on behalf of

the Defendant-Appellants and thereby misdirected himself in relation to the

requirements to establish proof of prescriptive title;

the learned District Judge has not properly investigated the title of the Plaintiff with

regard to the corpus of the instant action.

According to the evidence adduced by the 4th Defendant on behalf of the Defendants, the original

owner of the corpus was one Lindamulage John Richard De Silva. Therefore, it was the position

of the contesting Defendants that since the said Lindamulage John Richard De Silva had been in

possession of the corpus for a long period of time, he became entitled to a prescriptive title over

the land,

As such, it is clear that the contesting Defendants solely relied on the prescriptive title of the said

Lindamulage John Richard De Silva.

In a situation where the Plaintiff proved his pedigree, and the Defendants are claiming the

property rights and solely depending on a prescriptive claim, it is the burden of the Defendants

to prove their claim to the land by way of prescription.

In this regard, attention is drawn to Section 03 of the Prescription Ordinance No 22 of 1871;

Page 8 of 12

"Proof of the undisturbed and uninterrupted possession by a defendant in any action, or

by those under whom he claims, of lands or immovable property, by a title adverse to or

independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff in such action (that is to say, a possession

unaccompanied by payment of rent or produce, or performance of service or duty, or by

any other act by the possessor, from which an acknowledgment of a right existing in

another person would fairly and naturally be inferred) for ten years previous to the

bringing of such action, shall entitle the defendant to a decree in his favour with costs.

And in like manner, when any plaintiff shall bring his action, or any third party shall

intervene in any action for the purpose of being quieted in his possession of lands or

other immovable property, or to prevent encroachment or usurpation thereof, or to

establish his claim in any other manner to such land or other property, proof of such

undisturbed and uninterrupted possession as herein before explained, by such plaintiff

or intervenient, or by those under whom he claims, shall entitle such plaintiff or

intervenient to a decree in his favour with costs:

Provided that the said period of ten years shall only begin to run against parties claiming

estates in remainder or reversion from the time when the parties so claiming acquired a

right of possession to the property in dispute."

The only evidence adduced by the 4th Defendant with regard to the possession of their original

predecessor Lindamulage John Richard De Silva was that he had paid assessment tax to the

subject matter in dispute from the year 1942. According to the Assessment Register [61]

assessment tax had been paid by the said Lindamulage John Richard De Silva during the period

from 1942 to 1985 for the premises bearing no 52/3, Kithulandaluwa Road, Willorawatte.

In the case of Kirihamy Muhandirama Vs Dingiri Appu 6.N.L.R 197 an action brought by the

plaintiff to vindicate certain lands from the Defendants, Moncriff J. held that

in order that a person may avail [in order for a person to avail*] himself of section 3 of

the Prescription Ordinance No. 22 of 1871,

(1) Possession must be shown from which a right in another person cannot be fairly or

naturally inferred.

(2) Possession required by the section must be shown on the part of the party litigating

or by "those under whom he claims.

Page 9 of 12

(3) The possession of those under whom the party claims mean possession by his

predecessors in title.

(4) Judgement must be for a person who is a party to the action and not for one who sets

up the possession of another person, who is neither his predecessor in title nor a party to

the action.

Since the Defendant-Appellants solely relied on prescriptive title of their predecessor the said

Lindamulage John Richard De Silva, it is the burden of the Defendant-Appellants to prove

prescriptive possession of their predecessor.

Thus, the Defendant-Appellants are obliged to prove that they had exclusive possession of the

defined block of land claimed by the Defendant-Appellant without any interruptions or

disturbances for well over a period of ten years.

In this regard, a mere general statement of witnesses that the possessor had possessed the land

in dispute is not sufficient evidence to prove prescriptive possession.

In Juliana Hamine Vs. Don Thomas (59 N. L. R. 546) L. W. De Silva J. observed that when a

witness gives evidence of prescriptive possession and states "I possessed" or "we possessed" the

Court should insist on those words being explained and exemplified. The Court relied upon the

observation made by Bertram C.J. in the case of Alwis Vs. Perera (21 N.L.R. 321) (full bench) in

which it states that;

"I wish very much that the District Judges - I speak not particularly, but generally- when

a witness says, "I possess" or "we possess", or "we took the produce" would not confine

themselves merely to recording the words but would insist on those words being

explained and exemplified. I wish District Judges would abandon the present practice of

simply recording these words when stated by the witnesses and would see that such facts

as the witnesses have in their minds are stated in full and appear in the record."

On behalf of the Defendant-Appellant the 4th Defendant Lindamulage Erin Malkanthi De Silva

adduced evidence to establish their prescriptive claims.

The 4th Defendant has stated in evidence that the impugned subject matter of the instant action

had been possessed for a long period of time by Lindamulage John Richard Silva and as such

became entitled to a prescriptive right. Nevertheless, no evidence was adduced to prove how

Lindamulage John Richard De Silva came into possession of the impugned land and whether he

Page 10 of 12

developed the land. Thereby the Defendant-Appellants had failed to prove the date or period

from which the adverse possession commenced to claim a prescriptive right.

It is to be noted that the 4th Defendant had said in evidence that her father is more competent

than her to adduce evidence in this regard, but the father was not called as a witness to give

evidence.

The only evidence submitted by the Defendant-Appellant to prove a period of possession by the

said Lindamulage John Richard De Silva was by producing an assessment register 61 to show

that assessment tax had been paid during the period from 1942 to 1985. However, it was not

revealed in evidence that the said Lindamulage John Richard De Silva was in exclusive possession

of the subject land during the said period 1942-1985, which is the requirement for a

prescriptive title under our law as elucidated in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

In the case of Sirajudeen Vs Abbas [1994(2) S.L.R 365], G. P. S. De Silva C. J. elucidated the legal

requirements and proof necessary to establish prescriptive title in the following manner,

where the evidence of possession lacked consistency, the fact of occupation alone or the

payment of municipal rates by itself is insufficient to establish prescriptive possession.

Where a party invokes the provisions of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order

to defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of

proof rests squarely and fairly on him to establish a starting point for his or her

acquisition of prescriptive rights.

a facile story of walking into abandoned premises after the Japanese air raid constitutes

material far too slender to find a claim based on prescriptive title.

As regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere general statements of

witnesses that the plaintiffs possessed the land in dispute for a number of years exceeding

the prescriptive period are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse possession

necessary to support a title by prescription. It is necessary that the witness should speak

to specific facts and the question of possession has to be decided thereupon by Courts.

One of the essential elements of the plea of prescriptive title as provided for in section 3

of the Prescription Ordinance is proof of possession by a title adverse to or independent

to that of the Claimant or Plaintiff. The occupation of the premises must be of such

character as is incompatible with the title of the owner.

Page 11 of 12

It is worthy to note that according to the assessment register 61 from 1986 onwards, owners

name has been changed and it indicates for the year 1986 successors of L.J.R De Silva and for

the period of 1987-1990 Erin Malkanthi De Silvas name appears on the register.

The said Malkanthi De Silva is the 4th Defendant-Appellant who gave evidence before the learned

District Judge. It is observable that in cross-examination the said witness the 4th Defendant could

not describe the boundaries of the subject land.

Court draws the attention to the plan submitted by the contesting Defendants, bearing no 397

dated 04.09.1985 marked as 41 and produced in evidence. The said plan depicts lot D in plan

bearing no 5402 dated 30.03.1940 [P2] made by M.S De Silva licensed surveyor and filed of

record in District Court of Colombo Case no 617/P which is in the lot allocated to Richard

Vincent Mendis in the said final partition decree of the District Court of Colombo case bearing

no 617/Partition.

The said lot D was subdivided into lots 1,2,3,4 and 5 by plan bearing no 397 dated 04.09.1985

[41]. Therefore, it is apparent that the Defendant-Appellants had admitted that the impugned

corpus is lot D depicted in the final partition plan bearing no 5402 dated 30.03.1940 [P2]. This

is tantamount to an admission that the original owner of lot D is Richard Vincent Mendis.

Since the Plaintiff has proved her title, it is the burden of the Defendant-Appellants to prove their

prescriptive right to the subject matter.

According to Section 03 of the Prescriptive Ordinance, proof of exclusive possession by a title

adverse to or independent of that of the plaintiff is an essential element to prove prescriptive title.

Hence, it is relevant to note that the Defendant-Appellants had not proved the necessary

ingredients to claim a Prescriptive title to the subject matter of the instant action. Apparently,

the Defendant had failed to establish that said Lindamulage John Richard De Silva had acquired

a Prescriptive title to the subject land.

It is noteworthy that the preliminary plan bearing no 6305 dated 20.03.1993 and report were

marked as X and Y respectively, by the contesting Defendants in cross-examination of the

Plaintiff.

It is seen that the boundaries of Plan X tallies with the corpus described in the schedule to the

Plaint. Nevertheless, the extent surveyed in Plan X is 38.9 Perches and the extent of Lot D in

Plan marked as [P2] described in the schedule to the Plaint is 29.85 perches.

Page 12 of 12

The report [X1] states that the boundaries are shown by 3,4,5,6,7 Defendants. Since the extent

surveyed is more than 9.05 perches had been surveyed extra and included to the corpus.

However, the surveyor had superimposed Lot D in Plan P2 on Plan X. Therefore, it is clear

that the 4th to 11th Defendants are in possession of the adjacent land to Lot D.

It is to be observed that the title deeds marked as 42, 44, 45 and, 4 6 relied upon by

contesting Defendants, referred to a Plan bearing no 397 dated as 02.09.1985 [41]. However,

court observes that the report pertaining to the said Plan [41] was not produced in evidence

nor filed of record.

It is worthy to note that since those title deeds were executed in the year 1985 and assuming

that the contesting Defendants encroached upon to lot D and commenced adverse possession

in 1985, and since the Plaintiff instituted the instant partition action on 30.03.1992, the

contesting Defendants have not proved that they have exclusively possessed the corpus with

defined boundaries for a period of 10 years to establish prescriptive possession to acquire

prescriptive right.

Therefore, Court is of the view that the contesting Defendants had not proved the necessary

ingredients to establish their prescriptive possession to claim a prescriptive right to the corpus

in dispute.

Hence, it clearly manifest that the learned District Judge had come to the correct findings of fact

and law and held against 4th to 11th Defendant-Appellants. As such, we see no reason to interfere

with the judgment of the learned District Judge of Panadura dated 17.08.2000. Therefore, the

appeal is dismissed with costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs.
