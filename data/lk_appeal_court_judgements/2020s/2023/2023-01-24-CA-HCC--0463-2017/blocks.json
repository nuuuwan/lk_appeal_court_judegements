Ratnayake Lekamlage Weeraratne, vs. the Attorney General, Court of Appeal Case No. HCC 52/2010, held that the intention of the legislature was clear when the amended Act No 27 of 1999 to the Judicature Act was enacted. It is to expeditiously continue and conclude the cases. To avoid any prejudice to the accused persons in criminal cases, proviso to section provides for the accused to demand if he so wishes to recall the witnesses before the successor Judge. That gives the accused an opportunity to a fair trial.",

What is important here is that the proceedings were properly adopted before the 2nd succeeding trial Judge, and in fact a witness, whose evidence had already been led before his immediate predecessor, was recalled by the said trial Judge, upon an application of the appellants made under section 48. On 01.06.2017, the said trial Judge delivered his judgment, after the defence case was heard by him in its entirety. Hence, this Court is of the view that there is proper adoption of evidence by the trial Court, as mandated by section 48 of the Judicature Act (as emended).
