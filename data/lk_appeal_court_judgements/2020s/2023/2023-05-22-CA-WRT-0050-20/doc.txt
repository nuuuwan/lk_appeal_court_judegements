RESPONDENTS

BEFORE : M. SAMPATH K. B. WIJERATNE, J

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J

COUNSEL : Boopathy Kahathuduwa for the Petitioner.

Nayomi Kahawita, SC for the Respondents.

ARGUED ON : 30.03.2023

DECIDED ON : 22.05.2023

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. The petitioner was initially recruited to the cadre of the Public Service

of the Central Province and was assigned to the Ministry of Education,

Local Government and Land of the province. After being enlisted to the

permanent cadre on 4th January 1994, the petitioner was transferred

7

to the Health Service Directorate of the Central Province with effect from

31st May 2001. Subsequently, the petitioner was appointed to the Supra

Grade of the Central Province Public Management Assistant Service and

assigned to the Health, Indigenous Medicine and Social Welfare

Ministry of the Central Province, effective from 8th April 2008. Following

this, on 27th May 2008, the petitioner was assigned as the

Administrative Officer of Matale District General Hospital. In

accordance with letter P-10, the petitioner was granted supervisory

responsibilities of the hospital maintenance unit and the minor staff, in

addition to other duties assigned to her.

After completing nine years of service in the capacity of Administrative

Officer, the petitioner requested to be transferred to Matale Health

Services Directorate or Matale Zonal Education Division. The petitioner

stated that all her requests for a transfer were denied or not responded.

Furthermore, the petitioner stated that she was able to reveal various

irregularities by the minor staff during that period.

As evident from the letter marked 1R-10, on a demand made by a Trade

Union, the Governor of the Central Province directed to temporarily

transfer the petitioner to a suitable place within the department.

However, the petitioner has been permanently transferred to the Office

of the Regional Director of Health Services of Kandy by the letter dated

03.01.2020 marked P-20 under the signature of the 7th respondent,

Secretary, Public Service Commission of Central Province subject to the

covering approval of the Provincial Public Service Commission. Against

the said transfer, the petitioner filed this application for writs and

sought the following reliefs:

A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision contained in the

document marked P-20.

8

A writ of certiorari to quash the decision contained in document

P-23 taken by the 8th to 14th Respondents to grant covering

approval for the transfer of the petitioner.

A writ of certiorari to quash documents marked P-21(a), P-21(b),

P-21(c).

A writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent

contained in the document P-22 to release the petitioner from

her duties.

A writ of certiorari to quash the decision contained in the

document marked P-30 in which the 8th to 14th Respondents

refused to consider the petitioners appeal.

A writ of mandamus directing the 7th respondent and/or 8th to

13th respondents and/or 14th respondent and/or anyone or more

of them to reinstate the petitioner in the position of

Administrative Officer of the Matale District General Hospital.

The statement of objections was filed on behalf of the respondents and

subsequently, a counter affidavit was filed by the petitioner. At the

hearing, the learned Counsel for the petitioner, and the learned State

Counsel for the respondents, made oral submissions.

The learned counsel for the petitioner advanced his arguments on the

following main grounds.

i. The Secretary to the Public Service Commission of the

Central Province has no authority to make this transfer.

ii. This kind of transfer is not recognized by law.

iii. The transfer was made without following the principles of

natural justice.

The learned State Counsel raised an objection regarding the

maintainability of this application submitting that the petitioner had

9

the right to make an appeal against the order of transfer to the Governor

in terms of the provisions of Provincial Council Act No. 42 of 1987 and

without recourse to the said alternative remedy, the petitioner cannot

maintain this application. I intend to deal with this objection when

considering the third ground of appeal.

First Ground of Argument -

The Secretary to the Public Service Commission of the Central Province

has no authority to make this transfer.

By the letter P-20, Secretary to the Public Service Commission of the

Central Province conveyed the decision of transfer subject to the

covering approval of the Provincial Public Service Commission as stated

previously. That means, even if the Provincial Public Service

Commission had the power to make the transfer, at the time of sending

the said letter by the secretary to transfer the petitioner with immediate

effect, the Central Provincial Public Service Commission has not

approved the decision of transferring the petitioner.

Citing the case of Gunarathne V. Chandrananda de Silva (1998) 3

Sri L.R. 275, the learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that the

Secretary to the Central Provincial Public Service Commission has

transferred the petitioner as per the letter P-20, but according to this

judgment, even if the Central Provincial Public Service Commission has

the authority to transfer the petitioner, the said power cannot be

delegated to its secretary.

In the said case of Gunarathne V. Chandrananda de Silva, it was

held as follows: It was very clear that it was the respondent who has

decided to place the petitioner on compulsory leave and had thereafter

recommended to the PSC that approval be granted to place the

petitioner on compulsory leave.

10

The powers given to the Public Service Commission regarding

disciplinary control has not been delegated, therefore the decision to

place the petitioner on compulsory leave has to be a personal decision

of the PSC, the decision-making body should bring their minds to bear

on the matter before them and take a collective decision and further

there must be evidence to support that such a decision was in fact

made.

According to the said judgment, even in an instance where the

Provincial Public Service Commission has the authority to make a

transfer, the Secretary to the Provincial Public Service Commission has

no authority to make that transfer. In the case at hand, the Secretary

to the Provincial Public Service Commission has made this transfer with

immediate effect expecting the covering approval of the Provincial Public

Service Commission.

The learned State Counsel argued in response that the Governor of the

Central Province had delegated certain powers to the Secretary to the

Central Provincial Public Service Commission and other government

officials by the letter dated 20.11.1990 marked 1R-1. The learned

Counsel further asserted that, under item 5 of the schedule attached to

1R-1, the Secretary to the Central Provincial Public Service Commission

had the authority to transfer the petitioner.

However, a careful review of document 1R-1 reveals that item 5 of the

schedule does not confer upon the Secretary to the Central Provincial

Public Service Commission, the authority to effect transfers within the

ministry. In fact, under item 5 of the schedule, the Secretary to the

Central Provincial Public Service Commission has not been given

authority to make any transfer specified under item 5. Moreover,

although the letter P-20 was signed by the Secretary to the Central

Provincial Public Service Commission, stating that it was done under

the command of the Central Provincial Public Service Commission, the

11

Commission could not have issued such a directive as it had not made

a decision regarding the transfer at the time of sending the letter. The

Secretary had sent the letter of transfer subject to the covering approval

of the Commission.

According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the secretary to the

ministry has been granted the authority to effect transfers within the

ministry. If the petitioners transfer in question was considered as a

transfer between two institutions within the health ministry, it is

correct that the Secretary to the Health Ministry should make that

transfer and the Secretary to the Central Provincial Public Service

Commission has no power to effect the transfer of the petitioner. If the

transfer in question is considered as a transfer within the department,

Head of the Department had to make the transfer on approval of the

Secretary to the Ministry according to the item 5 of the said schedule.

Even though, the learned State Counsel pointed out that according to

the item 5 of the schedule attached to 1R-1, the Secretary to the

Provincial Public Service Commission gets power to make this transfer,

no such power has been given to the Secretary according to the item 5

of the said schedule. According to the item 5, the transfers between

Ministries and orders of releasing from provincial council services (

) have to be made by the Provincial Public Service

Commission on the recommendation of the Chief Secretary, the 4th

respondent and not the 7th respondent. Therefore, even in those

occasions, the Secretary to the Public Service Commission of Central

Province, the 7th respondent has no authority to make the transfer in

question. Therefore, the transfer in question is unlawful.

Second Ground of Argument

This kind of transfer is not recognized by law.

The learned State Counsel contended that the transfer was carried out

in compliance with the Governor's directives. The learned State Counsel

12

further asserted that several complaints had been lodged against the

petitioner for allegedly inflicting mental stress and trauma on hospital

staff, and therefore, the temporary transfer was necessary to ensure the

efficient and uninterrupted functioning of the Matale District General

Hospital. The same argument was also highlighted in paragraph 21 of

the statement of objections.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner has

no issue with regard to the direction given by the Governor to make a

temporary transfer, but the petitioner seeks writs of certiorari to quash

the decisions pertaining to a permanent transfer made by the letter

P-20.

The direction of the Governor of the Central Province dated 20.12.2019

is contained in the letter marked 1R-10. It is precisely clear that the

Governor directed only to give a temporary transfer. However, by the

transfer order dated 03.01.2020 (P-20), the petitioner who served in the

Matale District Hospital was transferred to the Regional Director of

Health Services of Kandy as a permanent transfer. Hence, the transfer

made by letter P-20 is totally contradictory to the directions given by

the Governor in the document marked 1R-10. The petitioner has

preferred this application against the decision made by letter P-20.

At the hearing, the court inquired of the learned State Counsel as to the

nature of the transfer that had been effected by the 7th respondent

based on the proposal made by the 2nd respondent and the request

made by the 3rd respondent. In response, the learned State Counsel was

unable to provide an answer as to the type of transfer. However, she did

acknowledge that it could not be construed as a transfer on disciplinary

grounds.

It is to be noted that for a transfer to be made on disciplinary grounds,

a charge sheet must be issued, an inquiry must be conducted, and a

13

transfer may be made based on the findings of the inquiry. In

recommendation 02 of the inquiry report marked 1R-11, it was

specifically mentioned that no disciplinary action needed to be taken

since the allegations against the petitioner contained in the petition had

not been substantiated. (

) Therefore, it is precisely clear that the transfer in

question was not carried out on disciplinary grounds.

Undisputedly, the petitioner was employed in a position that is subject

to transfers. Considering the length of time that the petitioner had

served at the Matale District Hospital, it is evident that she is eligible

for transfer. Moreover, it has been revealed through the documents

submitted with the petition that the petitioner herself had requested a

transfer. The learned Counsel for the petitioner also submitted that the

petitioner agrees to be transferred to any institution within the Matale

District that aligns with her qualifications and position.

The criteria and the procedure for annual transfers have been clearly

defined in document P-27. The timetable pertaining to annual transfers

has been explicitly laid out on page 5 of the aforementioned document.

As per the stipulated schedule, an employee may apply for a transfer

before the 31st of July each year. Following the decision on the transfer

application, the employee may appeal, and the appeals would

subsequently be assessed. Following this, the transfers would take

effect from the 1st of January of the following year. In perusing

document P-27, it is evident that the transfer in question was not an

annual transfer as well.

Furthermore, it is clear that the transfer in question was not

necessitated by service requirements. Had this been the case, the letter

of transfer dispatched to the petitioner would have explicitly stated that

the transfer was due to service exigencies.

14

According to the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1589/30 dated 20.02.2009,

under the general conditions relating to transfers of public officers in

the public service, transfers are fourfold as follows:

i. Transfers done annually

ii. Transfers done on exigencies of services

iii. Transfers done on disciplinary grounds

iv. Mutual transfers on requests made by officers.

The respondents have failed to demonstrate that the Provincial Public

Service Commission or its Secretary is authorized to make any other

type of transfer in addition to the aforementioned four categories. The

transfer in question does not fall under any of the specified transfer

categories.

In addition, the respondents cannot argue that they are entitled to make

this transfer because this type of transfer is not forbidden by law. In

the judgment of C.A. Writ/541/2008, decided on 05.08.2019 a

proposition in Abesinghe Arachchige Asoka v. P.R.P Rajapaksha

and other (C.A. Writ 208/2013, CA minutes of 02.09.2016) has been

cited as follows: This principle that what is not forbidden is permissible

in law may hold good in procedural law. But it may not hold water in

administrative law which requires public authorities to keep within the

bounds of statutory powers. A statutory authority endowed with

statutory powers has no common law power at all: it can legally do only

what the statute permits and what is not permitted is forbidden.

As stated previously, the learned State Counsel who appeared for the

respondents acknowledged before this court in reply to the question

posed by the Court that she is unable to show any legal provision or

authority given to the respondents to make this transfer. Thus, it is

evident that neither the 7th respondent nor any other respondent

15

possesses the statutory power or authority to make such a transfer.

Furthermore, no circular or legally acceptable document granting such

authority to the respondents has been presented to this Court.

Therefore, I am inclined to agree with the contention of the learned

Counsel for the petitioner that this transfer has been carried out

without proper statutory power or authority, rendering it unlawful. To

put it simply, this order of transfer is without legal authority and thus,

illegal.

Third Ground of Argument

The transfer was made without following the principles of natural

justice.

The next issue to be addressed is the argument of not following the

principles of natural justice. The court sought clarification from the

learned State Counsel on whether the petitioner was afforded the

opportunity to make a statement concerning the matters related to the

transfer in question. The learned State Counsel conceded that the

petitioner was not given an opportunity to make a statement or

participate in an inquiry related to her transfer.

Despite the steps that were taken by the respondents to carry out a

transfer that is not recognized by law, the petitioner was not even given

the opportunity to express her grievances or respond to any allegations

against her. The correspondence marked P-16 and P-17 indicates that

a meeting was scheduled on 24.12.2019 to discuss about the petition

sent against the petitioner with the participation of relevant parties.

However, a letter from the Director of Provincial Health Service in

Matale marked X-2 and dated 30.01.2020, clearly states that the

discussion was held without the participation of the petitioner, but with

the participation of all government officials and representatives of the

trade unions. The learned counsel for the petitioner stated that the

petitioner came to attend the discussion as she was informed, but she

was excluded from the proceedings, during which the decision to

16

transfer her to an institution outside the Matale District was taken. This

is a clear violation of the principles of natural justice.

Lord Denning expressed his views in Kanda v. Government of Malaya

[1962] A.C. 322 as follows: if the right to be heard is to be a real right

which worth anything, it must carry with it a right in the accused man

to know the case which is made against him. He must know what

evidence has been given and what statements have been made affecting

him; and then he must be given a fair opportunity to correct or

contradict them.

In the case at hand, an inquiry was conducted by a committee

consisting of the Senior Assistant Secretary of the Health Ministry, the

Local Government Assistant Commissioner of the Department of Local

Government, and the Deputy Director (Planning) of the Health Ministry.

The report pertaining to the said inquiry marked 1R-11 concluded that

the allegations contained in the petition sent against the petitioner have

not been proved. Disregarding this finding, the respondents allowed

representatives of all trade unions who sent the petition against the

petitioner to participate in the discussion while not allowing the

petitioner who was found to be not at fault for the allegations contained

in the said petition and who had come to attend the discussion. The

respondents then decided to transfer the petitioner during this

discussion without informing her of the statements that affected her,

and without giving an opportunity to contradict them.

In considering the aforesaid circumstances, the decision of transfer

made by letter P-20; the letter P-23, granting covering approval; letters

P-21(a), P-21(b), P-21(c) communicated among the respondents

regarding the transfer have to be quashed for the reason of violation of

the principles of natural justice alone.

17

The objection of the maintainability of this application without making

an appeal to the Governor of the Central Province

At this juncture, I would like to address the objection raised by the

learned State Counsel that the petitioner cannot maintain this

application without exhausting the alternative remedy of making an

appeal to the Governor. The learned Counsel for the petitioner

responded to this objection by referring to letter P-16, which indicated

that the discussion in question was conducted and headed by the

Governor of the Central Province. The Counsel for the petitioner argued

that it would be pointless to file an appeal with the Governor, who did

not allow the petitioner to take part in the discussion that culminated

in the decision to transfer her.

According to Section 33(8) of the Provincial Councils Act, The Governor

of a Province shall have the power to alter, vary or rescind any

appointment, order of transfer, or dismissal or any other order relating

to a disciplinary matter made by the Provincial Public Service

Commission of that Province.

It is correct that the remedy by way of certiorari is normally not

available where an alternative remedy is open to the petitioner. This

rule, however, is subject to certain limitations. It was held in Linus

Silva Vs. The University Council of the Vidyodaya University 64

NLR 104 that one limitation is that the alternative remedy must be an

adequate remedy.

In the case of Whirlpool Corporation v Registrar of Trademarks,

Mumbai, (1998) 8 SCC 1, it was held that Under Article 226 of the

Constitution, the High Court, having regard to the facts of the case, has

the discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition. But the

High Court has imposed upon itself certain restrictions one of which is

that if an effective and efficacious remedy is available, the High Court

18

would not normally exercise its jurisdiction. But the alternative remedy

has been consistently held by this Court not to operate as a bar in at

least three contingencies, namely, where the writ petition has been filed

for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights or where there

has been a violation of the principle of natural justice or where the

order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an

Act is challenged. (Emphasis added)

In the case of Harbanslal Sahnia v Indian Oil Corporation. Ltd,

(2003) 2 SCC 107, the Supreme Court of India held that; In an

appropriate case, in spite of the availability of the alternative remedy,

the High Court may still exercise its writ jurisdiction in at least three

contingencies: (i) where the writ petition seeks enforcement of any of

the fundamental rights; (ii) where there is a failure of principles of

natural justice; or (iii) where the orders or proceedings are wholly

without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged. (Emphasis

added)

In the case at hand, it is obvious that not only there was a failure to

follow principles of natural justice in arriving at the impugned decision

of transfer but also the Governor of the Central Province who presided

over the discussion that resulted in taking the decision to transfer was

responsible for violating these principles. Therefore, I concur with the

assertion of the learned Counsel for the petitioner that pursuing an

appeal to an individual who has defied the principles of natural justice

is futile.

In considering the circumstances of this case with the decisions of the

aforesaid judicial authorities, I hold that not exhausting the alternative

remedy of making an appeal to the Governor of the Central Province

would not operate as a legal bar to exercise the writ jurisdiction of this

court.

19

The legal position in issuing a Writ of Certiorari

In Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service

]1985] AC 374 (GCHQ case), Lord Diplock classified the following three

grounds as grounds for judicial review.

i. Illegality

ii. Irrationality/unreasonableness

iii. Procedural impropriety

In the case of Secretary of State for Education and Science v.

Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council- [1977] AC 1014 Lord

Diplock described unreasonableness as follows: to fall within this

expression it must be conduct which no sensible authority acting with

due appreciation of its responsibilities would have decided to adopt.

When no fault of the petitioner was found as evident from the findings

and recommendations of the inquiry report 1R-11, it is illegal and

irrational to transfer the petitioner in a manner that deviates from the

legally recognized modes of transfer, simply to appease trade unions.

Apart from taking the decision regarding an illegal transfer, the

petitioner was not even given an opportunity to represent herself at the

inquiry at the discussion held with the participation of all other relevant

government officials and representatives of trade unions. This is

unreasonable conduct on the part of the respondents as well as a

violation of the principles of natural justice. In addition, the transfer

executed by the letter P-20 is illegal, because the Secretary to the Public

Service Commission of Central Province does not possess the requisite

authority to make such a transfer.

For these reasons, the writs of certiorari prayed for by the petitioner

must be issued.

20

The Writ of Mandamus prayed for by the petitioner

The learned State Counsel tendered a motion dated 23.03.2023 and

drew the attention of this court to the cabinet decision dated

14.06.2021, the observations of the Public Service Commission dated

10.06.2021, and the letter addressed to the Secretary of the Ministry of

Health dated 12.01.2022 and submitted that it has been decided,

based on the said cabinet decision, that the Matale District General

Hospital, which was hitherto governed by the Provincial Council of

Central Province, to be handed over to the Central Government with

effect from 31.12.2021. Considering the change of circumstances

pointed out by the learned State Counsel, this court decided not to

consider the Writ of Mandamus prayed for by the petitioner.

Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, the writs of Certiorari prayed for in the prayer

(b) (c) (d) and (e) to the petition are issued quashing the decisions

contained in the documents P-20, P-23, P-21(a), P-21(b), P-21(c), and

P-22.

However, it should be noted that this order should not be considered as

an order authorizing the petitioner to remain and serve in the District

Hospital, Matale indefinitely. The emphasized point in this judgment is

that any transfer must adhere to the legally recognized criteria and

follow the prescribed procedures.

Application allowed.
