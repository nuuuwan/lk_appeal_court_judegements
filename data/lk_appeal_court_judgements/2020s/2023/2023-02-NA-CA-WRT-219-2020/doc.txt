B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The instant application is instituted by the Petitioner acting in the public interest

to have the provisions of the Excise Ordinance and the regulations promulgated

thereunder strictly enforced by the responsible Respondent authorities against the

alleged infractions of the law committed at the hands of the 6th Respondent (Heineken

Lanka Limited).

When this matter was fixed for argument on the 9th of February 2023, the learned

Presidents Counsel for the 6th Respondent raised certain preliminary objections, on the

strength of which he sought to have this application dismissed in limine. These objections

are based on the futile nature of this application. This order is to determine the viability

of the preliminary objections.

Prior to delving into the objections, it is pertinent to set out, in brief, the genesis

of this application.

The 6th Respondent (Heineken Lanka Limited), as manufacturers of malt liquor,

had been bestowed the privilege of a wholesale license for the sale of malt liquor by the

bottles/cans/kegs (not to be consumed on the premises) under and in terms of Excise

Notifications Nos. 796 and 849 (published in Gazette Notification dated 26th December

Page 4 of 6

1990 P3 and Gazette Notification dated 6th November 2002 P4, respectively) so as to

facilitate the sale of liquor manufactured by it, by wholesale. These licenses are subject to

general conditions set out in Excise Notification 666 (published in Gazette Notification

dated 31st December 1979 P5) which are relevant to all licenses issued under the Excise

Ordinance. One such condition is clause 12(a). This Clause reads:

No Privilege of manufacture, supply or sale or any interest therein shall be sold,

transferred, or sub-rented without the previous permission of the Government Agent or

the Excise Commissioner; nor shall any agent or attorney be appointed for the

management of any such privilege or for signing the counterpart agreement of any

Excise licence without the previous approval of the Government Agent or the Excise

Commissioner. Such agent or attorney shall, in every case, be a citizen of Sri Lanka and

such approval shall be given only in exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the

Government Agent or the Excise Commissioner.

The Petitioner, as narrated in the Petition, became aware that the 6th Respondent

had allegedly contravened this condition by entering into contracts with distributors for

the purpose of distributing its products and that such distributors operated, stored, and

distributed liquor to the retail sellers without a valid liquor license; a violation of Section

18 of the Excise Ordinance which outlaws the sale of excisable items without a license.

The Petitioner claims this circumvention of the law is a ruse, devise and subterfuge and

deception to deprive the State coffers of due revenue in the form of license fees. Despite

several communications sent to the Respondent authorities to bring their attention to this

apparent circumvention of the law, there was no response (P8 and P9). The Petitioner

is now before this Court, primarily seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the

Manufacturers wholesale License for the sale of Malt Liquor by the Bottles/cans/Kegs(Not

to be consumed on the premises), issued to the 6th Respondent and Writs of Mandamus,

inter alia, to compel the relevant Respondent authorities (the 1st to 3rd Respondents) to

take immediate and expeditious action to prevent the 6th Respondent from misusing the

wholesale license issued to it; to compel them to take action against the 6th Respondent

for violating the provisions of the Excise Ordinance and the Regulations promulgated

thereunder; to strictly and forthwith implement and enforce the provisions contained in

the Excise Ordinance, as amended, as well as the Excise Regulations, Notifications and

Orders, without any demur.

The objection of futility has two aspects to it. It is contended that proceeding with

this application is futile, firstly, because the license sought to be cancelled is the license

issued for the year 2020 (and that the 6th Respondent has already been granted a license

for the year 2023) and, secondly, because the relief prayed for, in a sense, has been granted

by the undertaking of the Respondent authority to conduct an inquiry.

The first contention was raised in response to the issuance of certiorari. It was

contended that, it is futile for us to quash a license that was issued in 2020 and expired

at the end of 2020, as such licenses are legally valid only for a period of one year (vide

condition (b) of Excise Notification 849). However, as the learned Presidents Counsel for

the Petitioner declared in Court that the Petitioner would not be pursuing certiorari, there

is no necessity for us to address that objection. Our focus will be only on the second aspect

of the futility argument.

It is argued that the relief that is claimed has in substance already been granted

because the Respondent authorities have commenced an inquiry into the alleged

infractions of the law. The State has undertaken to do so as well as evident in the

proceedings dated 31st January 2023 and 9th February 2023 in CA/WRT 415/2020 where

similar relief was sought against the 6th Respondent and Lion Brewery PLC. The

application in CA/WRT 415/2020 was withdrawn subject to the Commissioner Generals

undertaking to conduct the inquiry into the alleged infractions.

However, as evident from the documents in the Brief, this inquiry commenced after

the present application was instituted. Meaning, the Respondent authorities began to

take steps to investigate the matter only after the present application was instituted. This

delay on their part is attributed to the Covid- pandemic and the consequent lockdowns.

In the instant application, the Petitioner is continuing with his battle for

mandamus because the end result of this alleged infraction concerns a loss to the state,

which if it is true must be investigated. We are also mindful that this application is filed

in the public interest.

Therefore, we are of the view, that this Court will be better able to determine

whether the criteria for the issuance of the writs of mandamus prayed for has been made

out once it has the benefit of hearing the parties in the argument stage.

The objection is overruled.

We direct the inquiry relating to this matter conducted at present by the relevant

officials at the Excise Department to be halted until this Court makes its final

determination.
