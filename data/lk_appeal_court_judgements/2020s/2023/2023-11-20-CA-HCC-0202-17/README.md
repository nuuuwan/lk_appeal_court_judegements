Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Colombo for the offence procuration of a female on or

about 28-02-2006 in Kollupitiya, within the jurisdiction of the High Court of

Colombo to become a prostitute, and thereby committing an offence punishable

in terms of section 360A(1) of the Penal Code as amended by Penal Code

(Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1995.

After trial, the appellant was convicted as charged by the learned High Court

Judge of Colombo of the Judgement dated 28-02-2017, and was sentenced to a

rigorous imprisonment period of 3 years. She was ordered to pay a fine of Rs.

50000/- and in default, she was sentenced for a period of 1-year rigorous

imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant preferred

this appeal.

The facts as revealed in evidence before the High Court can be briefly

summarized as follows.

Facts in brief

PW-01 was serving as a police inspector attached to the Foreshore police station

during the time relevant to this incident. He has received an information about

an operation of a brothel house ( ) at No. 49 A, Dickman place,

Kollupitiya.

After assembling a team of officers to conduct a raid in that regard, and after

having obtained a search warrant from the Fort Magistrates Court, he has

proceeded to conduct the raid. He has chosen two police officers, Bandara and

Wimalasena and has given Rs. 2000/- to police officer Wimalasena, instructing

him to go to the place where the prostitution operation was going on and obtain

the services of a female by paying money to the manager of the place.

Police officer Bandara has been instructed to accompany Wimalasena, and send

a signal to PW-01 when the deal is complete.

The aforementioned Wimalasena and Bandara has gone into the house and had

met up with the appellant who was the person in charge of the operation. There

had been 11 females in the company of the appellant. Officer Wimalasena has

given money to the appellant and upon the direction by her, has chosen one of

the females paraded. He has been directed to go to a cubicle which had no door,

but only a covering.

According to the evidence of Wimalasena, once they were inside, the female had

removed her clothes, and while she was in the process of removing his shirt, he

has given a pre-arranged signal to Bandara who was seated outside in the hall.

The officer Bandara in turn has sent a signal to PW-01 who was outside of the

house on the main road, indicating that the transaction has been completed.

Accordingly, PW-01 and his team has entered the house and arrested the

Page 4 of 14

manager who was the appellant, the female who was with police officer

Wimalasena and other females who were in the house.

At the scene of the alleged crime, the PW-01 and his team has recovered the

money paid by officer Wimalasena to the appellant in a drawer of the table where

the appellant was seated and several condoms as well.

The charge of procuration against the appellant has been framed based on the

above facts.

The prosecution has led the evidence of only two witnesses, namely PW-01, the

police inspector who organized and conducted the raid, and that of police officer

Wimalasena who was the person went inside the house and obtained the services

of the female.

It needs to be noted that police officer Bandara who went along with Wimalasena

and observed what was happening until Wimalasena entered the cubicle with

the female and saw in what state they were after the raid was conducted, had

not been called as a witness. It was he who could have provided a clear

corroboration as to the events that took place at that time. He was the

prosecution witness number 3 named in the indictment. The female alleged to

have been engaged in the act of prostitution with the officer Wimalasena has also

not been called as a witness and she was not a listed witness in the indictment.

It appears from the defence taken up by the appellant that she has not denied

that a raid took place on the day relevant to this incident. Her stand had been

that she was never engaged in the profession of prostitution, but only conducted

a business of operating a massage parlour. Her stand had been that she was

operating this massage parlour without any issue over a long period of time and

in accordance with the rules governing the trade.

After hearing the evidence, and after listening to the submissions of the

respective parties, the learned High Court Judge of Colombo has pronounced the

Page 5 of 14

impugned Judgement, where it had been determined that the prosecution has

proved the case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant.

After discussing the basic principles of evidence that a trial Judge should be

mindful when deciding a criminal trial against an accused person, it appears

that the learned High Court Judge has very correctly identified the basic

ingredients of the charge that should be proved before the Court by the

prosecution in order to prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt against the

appellant.

On page 11 of the Judgement (page 181 of the appeal brief), the learned High

Court Judge has observed the following;

, 360()

.

. ,

.

Although the learned High Court Judge has wrongly mentioned the penal section

under which the appellant was indicted before the High Court as section 360B

[360()], instead of the correct section which was section 360A(1) [360(1)], I

would like to attribute it to a typographical error as the learned High Court Judge

has correctly identified the ingredients of the charge.

For matters of clarity, I would now reproduce the relevant section 360A(1) of the

Penal Code, which reads thus.

360A. Whoever -

(1) Procures, or attends to procure, any person, whether male or

female of whatever age (whether with or without the consent

of such person) to become, within or outside Sri Lanka, a

prostitute;

Page 6 of 14

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

commits the offence of procuration and shall on conviction be

punished with imprisonment of either description for a term of not

less than 2 years and not exceeding 10 years and may also be

punished with a fine.

It clearly appears from the Judgement that the learned High Court Judge has

been guided by the Judgement pronounced in the case of Rosemary Judy

Perera Vs. The Republic CA Appeal 283/2012 decided on 17-01-2014, where

the facts were strikingly similar to the facts of the appeal under consideration.

Following the matters that need to be proved in a case of this nature, as

discussed in the above-mentioned Judgement, the learned High Court Judge has

determined the following; as the matters that need to be established by the

prosecution.

,

. ,

,

. ,

, .. 02

.

After having analyzed the evidence led in the trial, and the defence taken up by

the appellant, the learned High Court Judge has determined that the defence of

the appellant, where she has claimed that she only conducted a business of a

spa cannot be accepted.

Page 7 of 14

The final conclusion of the learned High Court Judge reads as follows. The

mentioned section 360() [section 360B] again appears to be a typographical

error whereas it should be 360A(1).

,

.. 02

. ,

. , 360(1)

.

It is clear from the said final conclusion of the learned High Court Judge, it has

been determined the proof of the fact that the appellant obtained money and

gave the services of the female to engage in sexual intercourse with the decoy as

a prostitute, would be sufficient to prove the offence of procuration in terms of

section 360A(1) of the Penal Code.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. The prosecution cannot maintain the charge against the accused-

appellant as the raid conducted by the police is illegal due to non-

production of the warrant.

2. Failure to lead the evidence of the lady who was alleged to have been

procured to be a prostitute leads to a reasonable doubt on the

prosecution case.

3. Failure to lead the evidence of the person who assisted the decoy leads

to a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case.

Page 8 of 14

4. Non-listing of the lady who was alleged to have been procured to be a

prostitute in the back of the indictment as a witness has prevented the

accused from her right to a fair trial.

5. Whether the version of the prosecution fails the test of probability.

6. The learned High Court Judge has failed to properly consider the

material contradictions between the evidence of PW-01 and PW-02.

7. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider and evaluate the

dock statement of the appellant properly.

8. Without prejudice to the above grounds of appeal urged, the learned

trial Judge could have imposed a non-custodial sentence on the

appellant considering her age and medical condition.

In his submissions before this Court, the learned Counsel for the appellant relied

mainly on the Judgement pronounced by their lordships of the Supreme Court

in the case of Rosemary Judy Perera Vs. The Democratic Socialist Republic

of Sri Lanka SC Appeal 154/14 decided on 14-12-2020. This is an appeal

preferred before the Supreme Court with leave, challenging the Court of Appeal

decision in CA Appeal 283-2012 decided on 17-01-2014, which was the

Judgement heavily relied on by the learned High Court Judge to find the

appellant guilty for the charge preferred against her.

It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the Supreme

Court, after having considered the appeal preferred by the appellant in the above-

mentioned case has overturned the conviction and acquitted the appellant.

He was of the view that since the facts elicited by way of evidence before the High

Court are very much similar and the law that should have been considered was

also very much similar, and there cannot be any basis to allow the conviction

and the sentence of the learned High Court Judge as the matters considered are

no longer relevant in that context.

It was his contention that the main ingredient that needs to be proved in a case

of this nature would be that the accused person procured or attempted to

Page 9 of 14

procure the female to become a prostitute, and the evidence led at the trial was

insufficient to prove the said ingredient under any circumstance.

He agreed that although the person engaged in the act of prostitution, namely,

the relevant female mentioned in this action, who is alleged to have been

engaged in an act of prostitution at the time of the raid, may not be necessary to

prove the charge. However, it was his view that given the facts and the

circumstances of the case, not calling her, as well as the other police officer who

allegedly accompanied the officer Wimalasena to pay money and obtain the

services of the female, needs to be considered in favour of the version of events

by the appellant.

He was of the view that non-calling of the said material witnesses amounts to a

failure to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.

The learned State Counsel vehemently argued in favour of the conviction and

invited this Court to consider the Supreme Court Judgement in SC Appeal

154/2014 as a Judgement pronounced per incuriam. He was of the view that

their Lordships of the Supreme Court who pronounced the majority Judgement

in that case was misdirected on the law when they decided to follow the

Judgements pronounced in England on a similar law. It was also his view that

the Supreme Court was misdirected on the relevant facts as well.

It was contended that there was no evidence before the trial Court that the female

who is said to have engaged in prostitution with the decoy was already a

prostitute at that time. He contended that there was no missing link in the

evidence led by the prosecution to prove the charge and non-production of the

search warrant was not a material defect in the prosecution case as the evidence

led as to the search warrant was never challenged by the appellant.

The learned State Counsel moved for the dismissal of the appeal on the basis

that the grounds of appeal have no merit.

Page 10 of 14

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

Although the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated eight grounds of

appeal for consideration, as they are interrelated, I will proceed to consider the

grounds of appeal together, as it would be more appropriate, given the context

of the appeal.

Since the Court of Appeal Judgement upon which the learned High Court Judge

relied on to consider the relevant ingredients of the offence that needs to be

proved before the Court has now been overruled by the Supreme Court, I am of

the view that the appeal before this Court will have to be considered in terms of

the legal principles discussed in the Supreme Court judgment and not as

provided for in the relevant Court of Appeal Judgement considered by the learned

High Court Judge.

Although the learned State Counsel contended that this Court should not

consider the ratio decidendi of SC Appeal 154/2014 on the basis that the

conclusions have been reached per incuriam, I find no basis to agree with such

a contention. I am of the view that this Court is bound by the majority

determination of their Lordships of the Supreme Court as the matter has been

determined by interpreting the same section in relation to the evidence led in the

High Court on very much similar facts.

It was held in the SC Appeal 154/2014 (supra) that,

The issue, as I see it, is bereft of complications; if it can be said with

certainty that the act of offering women for lewdness (sexual acts or sexual

intercourse) in return for a payment, is subsumed within the meaning of

procuring a person to become a prostitute. Then the accused-appellant

should be guilty as charged. It also must be noted that there is no legislative

definition given to the term procuring and in the circumstances, the

construction that can be given to this legislative provision is a literal one. In

the 12th Edition of Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes by St. J. Langan

at page 28, it is stated that the most elementary rule of construction is that

Page 11 of 14

it is to be assumed that the words and phrases of technical legislation are

used in the technical meaning, if they have acquired one, and otherwise in

their ordinary meaning.

In the absence of a technical meaning the word procuring must be

construed in its ordinary meaning.

It was held in the case of Martison Vs. Hart (1854) 14 CB 357,

The rule is that words used by legislature should be given their plain and

natural meaning. By plain and natural meaning, it is meant the literal and

popular meaning as opposed to figurative or technical meaning. [N. S.

Bindras Interpretation of Statutes 12th edition at page 212]

Their Lordships of the Supreme Court in SC Appeal 154/2014 has considered

section 9(1) of the Vagrants Ordinance No. 4 of 1841 as the relevant legislative

provision that should be considered applicable to the facts proved before the

Court, archaic one may say, but the legislation very much part of the prevailing

law.

Section 9(1) of the Vagrants Ordinance reads as follows;

9.(1) Any person who

(a) knowingly lives wholly or in part on the earnings of

prostitution;

(b) systematically procures persons for the purpose of illicit or

unnatural intercourse shall be deemed to be an incorrigible

rogue within the true intent and meaning of this Ordinance,

shall be liable

It appears from the judgement that the Supreme Court has decided to consider

the decisions of the Courts in other jurisdictions, in particular common law

jurisdictions, in the absence of any precedents that can be followed based on the

judgments of our Courts on the issue.

Page 12 of 14

It is in that context the decisions reached in the United Kingdom under the

Sexual Offences Act of 1956 has been considered in comparison to section

360A(1) of the Penal Code.

I am not in a position to agree with the contention of the learned State Counsel

that the Supreme Court has determined that a female who engaged in

prostitution previously, but decided to leave her past behind and moved away

from her life as a prostitute has to be considered on the basis of once a prostitute

always a prostitute. What the Supreme Court has decided was that if the female

was already a prostitute at the time of the alleged procuration, the necessary

ingredient of the offence of procuration as required by section 360A(1), namely,

procuring to become a prostitute cannot be established.

After having considered the relevant decisions and the legislative provisions, it

has been determined that;

In order to establish the offence of procuration it must be proved that the

person procured was not a prostitute before the alleged procuration. The

burden is on the prosecution to establish that fact beyond reasonable doubt,

the degree of proof required in criminal cases, which is an evidentiary

burden. I do not think that one could say that there is a legal burden to

establish that fact by placing the testimony of the person procured before

the Court. This Court also appreciates the challenge the prosecution may

face in discharging its burden in instances where a person may fairly be

said to be living in whole or in part on the earnings of prostitution, that is to

say when there is parasitic relationship between the prostitute and the

tout, the bully, protector or the pimp as one may call the other.

It is therefore clear that the person alleged to have been procured is not an

essential witness to prove a charge given the particular facts and the

circumstances in relation to a case. However, the burden of proving the charge

that the accused person procured the person who engaged in the act of

prostitution to become a prostitute as stated in the section remains with the

Page 13 of 14

prosecution. It is in that context, the prosecutions failure to call witnesses

named by the prosecution in the indictment becomes relevant.

In the judgment under consideration, the learned High Court Judge has decided

to reject the stand of the appellant that she was only running a spa and not an

operation of prostitution. I am of the view that however weak the defence may

be, that fact alone would not suffice to assume that the charge against the

appellant has been proved, as the duty to prove the ingredients of the charge

remains with the prosecution.

In the case of Narender Kumar Vs. State of Delhi (NCT of Delhi, AIR 2012 SC

2281, it was held:

Prosecution case has to stand on its own legs and cannot take support from

the weakness of the case of the defence. However great the suspicion

against the accused and however strong the morel belief and conviction of

the Court, unless the offence of the accused is established beyond

reasonable doubt on the basis of legal evidence and material on the record,

he cannot be convicted for the offence. There is an initial presumption of

innocence of the accused and the prosecution has to bring home the offence

against the accused by reliable evidence. The accused is entitled to the

benefit of every reasonable doubt.

Having considered the above, it is my considered view that the mere fact that the

accused offered the alleged female in exchange of money to have sexual

intercourse as a prostitute would not suffice to prove the charge of procuration

as envisaged in section 360A(1).

As considered and stated in the SC Appeal 154/2014, in order to establish a

charge under section 360A(1) it becomes necessary to prove that the alleged

procured female became a prostitute, and that it was as a consequence of her

being procured by the accused-appellant to become a prostitute.

Page 14 of 14

I am unable to find any evidence in the appeal under consideration to determine

as such, other than, if the version of events as stated by the prosecution

witnesses are to be believed, that the appellant engaged in offering the services

of females as prostitutes by accepting money.

As considered above, I am of the view that such evidence is insufficient to

establish a charge in terms of section 360A(1) of the Penal code.

Accordingly, I set aside the conviction and the sentence of the appellant as it

cannot be allowed to stand, and acquit her of the charge preferred.

Appeal allowed.
