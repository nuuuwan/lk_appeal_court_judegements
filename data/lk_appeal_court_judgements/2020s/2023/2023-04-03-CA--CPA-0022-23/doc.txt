This is an application by the witness petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

petitioner) invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court seeking bail for

himself and to revise and set aside the orders made by the learned High Court

Judge of Colombo dated 23-11-2022 and 02-02-2023, where his application for

bail was refused.

The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption has

filed an action in the High Court of Colombo against a person for committing

four offences punishable in terms of section 19 (b) and 19 (c) of the Bribery Act.

The petitioner was the fourth witness named in the indictment. At the trial held

in that regard, the petitioner has given his evidence before the High Court on 31-

10-2022. On that day, on the basis that he is giving evidence detrimental to the

prosecution, an application has been made to treat him as an adverse witness

in terms of section 154 of the Evidence Ordinance, which has been allowed.

Accordingly, he has been cross-examined by the prosecution. At the end of his

evidence, the learned High Court Judge has ordered the remanding of the

petitioner by making the following order.

. .

It is clear from the above order, that the learned High Court Judge has remanded

the petitioner for an indefinite period, until The Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (hereinafter referred to as the Bribery

Commission) prefer an indictment against the petitioner, which would be an

event that can happen only after the conclusion of the trial where the petitioner

was supposed to have given false evidence. The next hearing date of the trial has

been fixed for 02-02-2023.

An application has been made on 23-11-2022, seeking bail for the petitioner.

The learned Counsel representing the Bribery Commission has made

submissions to the effect that once a person is remanded in terms of section 14

of The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act No. 19

of 1994 (The Act), such a person can be granted bail only by the Court of Appeal

under exceptional circumstances.

The learned High Court Judge has accepted the argument and has held that he

has no jurisdiction to grant bail in terms of section 14 (3) of the Act, and has

refused the application for bail.

Another application for bail has been made when the case was taken up for

further trial on 02-02-2023. When the 2nd application was made, the learned

Counsel who represented the petitioner has brought to the notice of the Court,

Page 4 of 7

the inappropriateness of keeping the petitioner under remand custody until the

conclusion of the trial, indicating that it would be prejudicial towards the

accused as well.

However, the learned High Court Judge has refused the 2nd application for bail

on the basis that he has no jurisdiction to grant bail.

We heard the learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner supporting his

application before this Court. We heard the views expressed by the learned

Counsel representing the Bribery Commission as well, in determining this

application.

The section of the Act under which the learned High Court Judge has purportedly

decided to remand the petitioner reads as follows.

14. (1) If in the course of a trial for an offence under the Bribery Act

or Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No. 1 of 1975, any witness

shall on any material point contradict either expressly or by

necessary implication the statement previously given by him in the

course of any investigation conducted by the Commission under this

Act, it shall be lawful for the presiding Judge or Magistrate if he

considers it safe just in all the circumstances to act upon such

statement if such statement is corroborated in material particulars

by evidence from an independent source ; and to have such witness

at the conclusion of such trial tried before such court upon a charge,

or if such court is the High Court, arraigned and tried on an

indictment, for intentionally giving false evidence in a stage of a

judicial proceeding.

(2) At any trial under subsection (1) it shall be sufficient to prove

that the accused made the contradictory statements alleged in the

indictment or charge and it shall not be necessary to prove which of

such statements is false.

Page 5 of 7

(3) The presiding Judge or Magistrate may, if he considers its

expedient, adjourn the trial of any accused under subsection (1) for

such period as he may think fit and in any such case the accused shall

be remanded until the conclusion of such trial.

Provided that the Court of Appeal may in exceptional

circumstances release such person on bail pending the conclusion of

the trial.

It is the view of this Court that although this Court finds nothing wrong in the

learned High Court Judges direction that the petitioner should be indicted for

giving false evidence, this Court finds no basis to agree with the order by the

learned High Court Judge to remand the petitioner until that event happens.

It is clear from the plain reading of the section that the trial mentioned in

subsection (2) is the trial where the person who has given false evidence has

been charged and not the trial where the person has allegedly given false

evidence.

Such a trial can take place only after the conclusion of the trial where such a

person has allegedly given false evidence and after an indictment is filed against

him in the High Court.

Similarly, the subsection (3) of section 14 where it says that a trial Judge can

remand the accused until the conclusion of such trial refers to an accused in a

trial where he has been charged or indicted for intentionally giving false evidence

in a stage of a judicial proceeding.

It is the view of this Court that remanding of a person can only arise after a

charge or an indictment is preferred against such a person and not before.

In terms of section 14 of the Act, the legislature in its wisdom has only described

the offence under which a person who has given false evidence can be charged

stating that the charge should be for intentionally giving false evidence in a stage

Page 6 of 7

of a judicial proceeding. It has not given any penal provision for a person

convicted of such a charge.

Therefore, it appears that the penal section under which a person can be charged

is section 190 of the Penal Code, where if found guilty, such a person can be

punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend

to seven years, and shall also be liable to a fine.

It is the considered view of this Court that the learned High Court Judge was

completely misdirected as to the relevant provisions of the law, when he

remanded the petitioner at the conclusion of his evidence, until an indictment is

filed against him. It is also the view of this Court that the learned Counsel for

the Bribery Commission was also misdirected as to the relevant law when it was

submitted that the petitioner could seek bail only before the Court of Appeal.

Such a submission can have substance only if the initial remand of the petitioner

was in accordance with the law. Releasing a person remanded in terms of section

14 (3) under special circumstances by the Court of Appeal would arise only in

the situation where an indictment or a charge has been preferred against such

a person at the conclusion of the trial, where he is alleged to have given false

evidence and not before.

Therefore, it is the considered view of this Court that remanding the petitioner

on 31-10-2022 and the refusal by the learned High Court Judge to grant him

bail on the basis that he has no jurisdiction to grant bail was not in accordance

with the law. Moreover, it is the view of this Court that there was no basis for

the learned High Court Judge to remand the petitioner in the first place.

Although this Court find merit in the submission made by the Counsel before

the High Court when the petitioner sought bail for the second time, that keeping

the petitioner in remand would be inappropriate and would have a bearing on

the case of the accused in the main case, I find it not necessary consider it further

as it has no relevance to the application under consideration.

Accordingly, the order dated 31-10-2022 where the petitioner was remanded,

and the two subsequent orders dated 23-11-2022 and 02-02-2023, where the

bail was refused to the petitioner are hereby set aside.

The learned High Court Judge of Colombo is directed to order the immediate

release the petitioner from the remand custody. He is directed only to warn the

petitioner to appear before the Court if and when an indictment is preferred

against him before his release.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this judgement forthwith

to the High Court of Colombo for necessary immediate compliance.

The Registrar is also directed to issue a copy of this judgement to the learned

Counsel for the petitioner on necessary charges, and to the Bribery Commission.
