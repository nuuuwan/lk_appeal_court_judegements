Page 4 of 9

Written submissions: Petitioners - 31.07.2023 1st, 2nd, 4th to 8th Respondents - - 3rd Respondent - 13.09.2023 Decided on: 20.09.2023 Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

What needs resolution by this Court in the instant Application is, whether the appointment

of the above named 3rd Respondent to the post of Director General of the Geological Survey

and Mines Bureau ('Bureau') by way of a letter dated 15.07.2020, marked "P6", is lawful.

The Petitioners primarily seek a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari, quashing above

decision (P6) to appoint the 3rd Respondent to the said post. Additionally, the Petitioners

are seeking a Writ of Prohibition, restraining the 1st, 2nd, 4th to the 7th Respondents to appoint

the 3rd Respondent or any individual to the substantive post/position of Director General of

the Bureau as contemplated in the letter dated 15.07.2020, marked "P6", in violation of the

provisions contained in section 6(1) of the Mines and Minerals Act, No.33 of 1992 ('Act').

In the focus of the factual matrix, the Chairman of the Bureau (Chairman) by way of a Board

Paper dated 25.03.2020 marked P2 informed the Board of Management (Board) of the

said Bureau that their former Director General has retired, necessitating the appointment of

an Acting Director General to fill his position. It seems that the Chairman has sought to

appoint a Director General (DG) in an acting capacity, as the former DG had retired on a

day (i.e. 25.03.2020) when a curfew was in force during the COVID-19 pandemic in the

country. The Chairman in the said Board Paper has emphasized that the relevant Minister

had informed him that, an appropriate candidate to fill the said position of Acting DG, must

be chosen from among the current senior officers of the Bureau. Thus, in the same Board

paper, the Chairman describes the qualifications of both Mr. K.T.U.S De Silva (Senior

Director Geology) and the 3rd Respondent who was the Senior Director - Mining at that

time. Anyhow, the Chairman, in the same Board Paper, further notes that he received a

petition against Mr. K.T.U.S De Silva dated 06.02.2020 and due to such reason, he deemed

that the said Mr. De Silva

Page 5 of 9

is unqualified to be appointed as the Acting DG. Hence, he proceeds to seek permission from

the Board to appoint the 3rd Respondent to the position of Acting DG through the same Board

Paper given the alleged advice of the relevant Minister.

At this stage, it is important to observe that the Minister, to whom the subject of Minerals is

assigned (Minister), has the power to appoint the DG of the Bureau under section 6(1) of

the said Mines and Minerals Act. The said section 6(1):

"The Minister shall appoint in consultation with the Board, a person having at least twelve years

of demonstrated professional and applied experience as a geologist or a mining engineer with a

postgraduate degree or Charter as the Director General of the Geological Survey and Mines

Bureau."

By virtue of the provisions of the said section, the Minister has the authority to appoint a DG

in consultation with the Board subject to other conditions therein.

The Minister has appointed the 3rd Respondent as the Acting DG with effect from 27.03.2020

by his letter dated 08.04.2020 (2R2). Anyhow, a brief perusal of the letter dated 22.07.2020

(P7) addressed to the Secretary of the relevant Ministry by the Chairman, demonstrates that

the Board has granted only a covering approval to appoint the 3rd Respondent to the post of

Acting DG. The said Chairman in "P7" has drawn the attention of the Secretary by the said

letter P7 to an investigation conducted against the 3rd Respondent by the Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption ('CIABOC') under reference No.

BC/2040/14. Further, he has indicated therein that the information taken into consideration

at the time of granting the covering approval to make the acting appointment was not

accurate. Despite the occurrences above, on a later date the Minister by way of his letter dated

15.07.2020 (P6) has formally appointed the 3rd Respondent as the 'Director General' of the

said Bureau.

The Petitioners contention is that this appointment, by virtue of "P6" is, ultra vires the law

set out in the aforementioned section 6(1), as the Board Members, by way of a Circular

Resolution had given the approval to appoint the 3rd Respondent as the DG of the Bureau

only in acting capacity. The Petitioners, referring to the above mentioned investigations led

by the CIABOC, further argue that the 3rd Respondent is in no way qualified to be appointed

Page 6 of 9

to the position of DG in light of the several severe complaints leveled against him, including

a complaint of obtaining a vehicle permit upon producing fabricated certificates to certify his

service period.

It is significant that the Chairman has categorically informed in the said letter P7 that the

Board has not considered whether the 3rd Respondent is qualified under the above section

6(1), for him to be appointed as Acting DG. When the Board, on 16.09.2020, took up the

matter of confirming the alleged covering approval to appoint the Acting DG, the Chairman

and several members of the Board altered their perspective in light of a bigger picture

considering the evidence against the 3rd Respondent emanated subsequently. The Board has

particularly considered the allegations of bribery and corruption against the 3rd Respondent,

as well as the fact that his personal file had been taken by the CIABOC, which eventually

limited the Boards capacity to ascertain whether the 3rd Respondent fulfills the eligibility

criteria set out under the relevant section in the said Act. Finally, at the said Board meeting

held on 16.09.2020, the members of the Board unanimously decided that they had not

granted any approval to appoint the 3rd Respondent to the post of DG.

Although the statement of objections on behalf of the 2nd and 8th Respondents have been filed,

the learned Additional Solicitor General who appears for the 1st,2nd,4th to 8th Respondents

informed Court that such Respondents are willing to abide by any order of this Court after

the final determination of this case. The Chairman affirming an affidavit dated 02.02.2022

submitted to this Court that the 3rd Respondent is not a fit and proper person to be appointed

to the post of DG of the Bureau as the 3rd Respondent is tainted with allegations of bribery

and misconduct. The 3rd Respondent, in his limited Statement of Objections, pleads that the

said section 6(1) of the Act only provides for the appointment of a DG; not for an Acting

appointment, and the Board's duty is limited to guide the Minister to ascertain the

qualifications of the intended DG. The said Respondent considers the letter dated 26.03.2020

issued by the Minister as an act well within the powers conferred to the Minister by the Act.

Firstly, I must examine whether the provisions of section 6(1) of the Act apply only to the

appointment of a DG on a permanent basis and do not apply to the instances when an acting

appointment is made. Although the procedural rules of the Public Service Commission are

not directly applicable to the Bureau the criteria adopted therein to make acting appointments

Page 7 of 9

are vital to be considered here. In terms of Clause 131 of such Rules, a public officer may be

appointed to act in a particular post a.) when the substantive holder of the said post is away

from work for a particular length of time and b.) until the appointing authority makes a

permanent appointment to fill a vacancy created to the substantive post. This implies an acting

appointment should be mandatorily made only for a limited period. Thus, a letter of

appointment to act in a substantive post needs to specify until what date or what specific

occurrence the acting appointment will be effective. No officer should be appointed to act in

a certain post for an indefinite period and without assigning an appropriate reason thereto. In

terms of Article 41(c)(2) of the Constitution, even the prerogative of the President to make an

acting appointment to specific posts is limited to 14 days. The said Article spells out that the

approval of the Constitutional Council is needed for appointments to act for a period

exceeding 14 days.

Bearing in mind, the criteria adopted in the above Procedural Rules and the Constitution, I

take the view that the lack of nominating a particular period or a reason when making the

appointment to act as the DG of the Bureau can be seen as a grave deviation from a due

procedure and thus it is irregular. This is evinced by the aforementioned letter dated

08.04.2020 (2R2). Therefore, making an appointment to act as the DG of the Bureau

without adopting a criteria and violating the due process should not be safeguarded by undue

interpretation restricting the provisions of section 6(1) only to permanent appointments.

Thereafter, it needs consideration by this Court whether the Minister has appointed the 3rd

Respondent to the post of DG by his letter dated 15.07.2020 (P6) in consultation with the

Board as specifically required under the said section 6(1). The 3rd Respondent sought in

argument to justify his appointment. His contention is that, the then Minister after being

satisfied with the 3rd Respondents ability and/or skills shown during the tenure as the Acting

DG has taken steps to appoint him as the DG on permanent basis. Im afraid that I cannot

accept such a proposition as there is no provision in the Act for the Minister to appoint the

DG on his own assessment and without first consulting the members of the Board. The Act

doesnt provide any additional mechanism for the Minister to deviate from the process

prescribed in said section 6(1).

Page 8 of 9

The Board decision reflected in P8, the Chairman's assertions in P7 and the affirmations

the Chairman made in his Affidavit submitted to Court all unambiguously illustrate that

neither the acting appointment nor the permanent appointment to the post of DG gained the

Board's concurrence or approval. What further proof is required to decide this point of law,

since the Board including the Chairman are quite precise on the fact that the 3rd Respondent

is not a fit and proper person to be selected as the DG of the Bureau? Hence, in the absence

of any consultation or concurrence of the Board in order to affect the appointment as reflected

in P6 and also due to this irregularity explained above in making the acting appointment,

it does not appear any necessity to conduct a thorough analysis to inquire whether the initial

covering approval is sufficient to fulfill the requirements of section 6(1) when making the

permanent appointment.

But for completeness, I should consider the submissions made on the above facet of the

arguments by the learned Presidents Counsel, who appears for the Petitioner. Referring to

several other statutes, he submits that it is the deliberate and categorical intention of the

lawmakers to emphasize the mandatory duty on the relevant Minister, under the said section

6(1), to consult the Board of the Bureau before making an appointment to the post of DG

whereas other respective statutes require two-tier scrutiny to make appointments. The said

learned Presidents Counsel strenuously argues that the predecessor of the 2nd Respondent

Minister has not obtained the concurrence of the Board prior to the impugned appointment

of the 3rd Respondent as the DG. He further emphasizes the fact that the words in

consultation means agreement or concurrence between the parties and accordingly, he places

considerable reliance on the below-mentioned ratio in the judgement of the Supreme Court of

India in Indian Administrative Service (SCS) Association Uttar Pradesh v. UOI 1993 SUPP (1)

SCC 733:

Consultation is a process which requires meeting of minds between the parties involved in the

process of consultation on the material facts and points involved to evolve a correct or at least

satisfactory solution. There should be meeting of minds between the proposer and the persons to

be consulted on the subject of consultation. There must be definite facts which constitute the

foundation and source for final decision. The object of the consultation is to render consultation

meaningful to serve the intended purpose. Prior consultation in that behalf is mandatory.

Page 9 of 9

As opposed to the Petitioners such arguments, the 3rd Respondent submitted that the word

in consultation does not cast a mandatory obligation on the Minster to act in accordance

with the decisions of the Board. In view of my above reasons, Im not inclined to agree with

such the stand taken by the 3rd Respondent and I have taken serious note to the assertions

made by the 3rd Respondent that he was appointed to the post of DG after the then Minister

Hon.S.M. Chandrasena was satisfied with his purported ability and skills shown during the

acting appointment.

In light of the reasons given above and based on the circumstances of this case I hold that the

3rd Respondent has been appointed on a permanent basis to the post of DG in gross violation

of the provisions of section 6(1) of the Act. Thus I proceed to issue a writ of Certiorari

quashing the decision of the predecessor of the 2nd Respondent to appoint the 3rd Respondent

to the post of DG of the Bureau and also the letter dated 15.07.2020 marked P6.

Additionally, a writ of Prohibition is issued restraining the 1st,2nd, 4th to 7th Respondents from

appointing the 3rd Respondent or any other person to the substantive post of DG of the Bureau

in pursuance and/or in furtherance of the decision reflected in "P6" and also in violation of

the provisions of section 6(1) of the Act.

At this stage, I must emphasize that the circumstances of this case compel me to exercise my

discretion to reject the contention of the 3rd Respondent that the reliefs prayed for in the

Petition have become academic and/or futile. I have arrived at such a conclusion since, the

serious repercussions due to the unlawful appointment described above cannot be concealed

by a mere objection based on futility.
