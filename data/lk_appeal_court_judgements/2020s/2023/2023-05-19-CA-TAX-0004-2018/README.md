Introduction

[1] This is an appeal by the Appellant by way of a Case Stated against the

determination of the Tax Appeals Commission dated 28.08.2017 confirming the

determination made by the Respondent on 15.09.2014 and dismissing the

Appeal of the Appellant. The taxable period related to the appeal is the year of

assessment 2009/2010.

Factual Background

[2] The Appellant is a limited liability company incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act, No. 17 of 1982 and the principal activity of the Appellant is supply of marine fuel and lubricants to local and foreign vessels. The Appellant submitted its return of income for the year of assessment 2009/2010 claiming that the supply of bunker fuel to foreign vessels could be treated as an export, and applied for the concessionary tax rate on the profits of the business in terms of sections 42 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended).

[3] The assessor by letter dated 26.11.2012 rejected the same for the following reasons:

1. Section 42 apples to consignee or consignor who is engaged in the

activities specified in section 42, and the examination of accounts and other

related documents of the company indicate that the characterstics of

consignment sale is not appeared in the transactions of Lanka Marime

Services Pvt Ltd;

3

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

2. As far as the business of Lanka Marine Services is concerned (a) the

ownership of the goods is transferred physically to the buyer within the water territory of Sri Lanka; (b) physical procession is vested with the buyer once the goods are transferred; (c) characterization of export has not been fulfilled;

3. Accordingly, section 42 is not applicable since (a) the company is not the

consignor/consignee and the company has not engaged in export and therefore, the applicable income tax rate on the profits is the normal rate of 35%;

[4] Accordingly, the assessor made tax computation for the above mentioned

year of assessment as follows:

Tax profit 22,275,642

Interest income 4,862,705

Total statutory income/assessablr/taxable income 27,138,347

Tax at 35% 9,498,421

Tax on distributable profit is 7,643.885

Total tax payable 17,142,306

[5] Notice of assessment was issued in terms of Section 163 (3) of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended) in respect of the year of assessment

2009/2010. The Appellant appealed to the Commissioner-General of Inland

Revenue (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) against the said

assessment. The Respondent by its determination dated 15.09.2014 confirmed

the assessment and dismissed the appeal (pp. 27, 15-24) of the Tax Appeals

Commission brief). The Respondent held that the sale of bunker fuel/lubricants

to foreign vessels cannot be treated as exports or consignment exports and

therefore, the concessionary tax rates under sections 52 or 42 of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended) do not apply.

Appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission

[6] Being dissatisfied with the said determination of the Respondent, the

Appellant appealed to the Tax Appeals Commission and the Tax Appeals

Commission by its determination made on 28.07.2017 confirmed the

determination made by the Respondent and dismissed the appeal. The Tax

Appeals Commission, after hearing the parties to the appeal by its determination

was pleased to reject all the contentions urged by the Appellant, and held that:

4

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

1. The determination made by the Respondent on 15.09.2014 has been made

within within the two year period in terms of section 165(14) of the Inland

Revenue Act (as amended);

2. The assessment made by the assessor on 29.11.2012 for the year of

asaeessment 2009/2010 is not time barred in terms of section 163(5) of

the Inland Revenue Act (as amended);

3. The word export including the meaning given in dictionaries, shall mean

the sending of goods from one country to another country and therefore,

there has to be a destination point outside Sri Lanka to constitute an

export. The destination point referred to in the relevant documents

submitted by the Appellant state that the destination point is Sri Lanka;

4. Although the decisions of the Indian cases are not binding in Sri Lanka,

they have a persuasive value, and the test that has been applied in the

Indian Supreme Court decision in Burmah Shell Oil Storage & Distributing

Company of India Ltd v. The Commercial Tax Officer and Others AIR 1961

SC 315 is that the goods must have a foreign destination where they can

be said to be imported, and so long as it does not satisfy this test, it cannot

be said that the sale was in the course of export;

5. Sale of bunker fuel/lubricants by the Appellant to foreign vessels cannot

be treated as exports and therefore, the Appellant is not entitled to the

concessionary tax rates under sections 52 or 42 of the Inland Revenue Act,

No. 10 of 2006.

Questions of Law for the Opinion of the Court of Appeal

[7] Being dissatisfied with the said determination of the Tax Appeals

Commission, the Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal and formulated the

following questions of law in the Case Stated for the opinion of the Court of

Appeal.

(1) Is the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission time barred?

(2) Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law when it came to the

conclusion that the determination made by the Commissioner General

of Inland Revenue was not time barred under and in terms of section

165(14) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended)?

5

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

(3) Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law when it came to the

conclusion that the assessment was not time barred?

(4) Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law when it came to the

conclusion that the Appellant was not entitled to the tax concession

conferred by section 42 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as

amended)?

(5) In the alternative, if section 42 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006

(as amended), is inapplicable, did the Tax Appeals Commission err in

law when it came to the conclusion that the Appellant was not entitled

to the concessionary tax rate conferred by section 52 of the Inland

Revenue Act , No. 10 of 2006 (as amended)?

(6) In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, did the Tax Appeals

Commission err in law when it came to the conclusion that it did?

Analysis

Question of Law, No. 1

Time bar of the determination made by the Tax Appeals Commission

[8] At the hearing, Dr. Shivaji Felix submitted that the appeal dated 09.04.2015

was tendered to the Tax Appeals Commission (hereinafter referred to as the

TAC) on 21.04.2015, and the first date of the hearing was 14.02.2017. His

submission was that the time bar for the determination of the appeal under

section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 (as amended)

should be calculated from the date on which the petition of appeal was

tendered to the Respondent on 21.04.2015. He submitted that although the

determination of the TAC was made on 28.08.2017, the TAC would have

commenced its sittings for the hearing of the appeal prior to well before this

date since the oral hearing had been held after more than one and one half

years from the date of tendering of appeal to the TAC. His submission was that

the determination has been made more than 270 days from the date of the TAC

commencing its sittings for the hearing of the appeal, which occurred on

21.04.2015 and therefore, the appeal is time barred by operation of law under

section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 (as amended).

6

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[9] He further submitted that the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011

(as amended) was intended to be a mandatory provision of law and required

strict compliance. He submitted that the directory provision would not have

required an amendment with retrospective effect, and the avoidance of doubt

provision found in section 15 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of

2011 would not have required if the time bar stipulated in section 10 of the Tax

Appeals Commission Act, was intended to be directory. Dr. Felix heavily relied

on the following statement made by His Lordship Gooneratne J. in Mohideen v.

Commissioner -General of Inland Revenue (CA 2/2007 (20-15) Vol. XXI. BASL

Law Journal, page 171 decided on 16.01.2014, referring to the statutory time

bar applicable to the Board of Review to make a determination under the Inland

Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 37 of 2003 at p. 176:

If specific time limits are to be laid down, the legislature needs to say so in very clear and unambiguous terms instead of leaving it to be interpreted in various ways. To give a restricted interpretation would be to impose unnecessary sanctions on the Board of Review. It would be different or invalid if the time period exceeded two years from the date of oral hearing. If that be so, it is time barred. [Emphasis added]

[10] On the other hand, Mrs. Jameel submitted that the Court of Appeal in

Mohideen v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra), held that the

hearing means the date of the actual oral hearing, which constitutes ratio

decidendi, and that the statement made by Gooneratne J. was only an obiter

dicta, and not the ratio decidendi. She submitted that the determination has

been made within a period of 270 days from the date of the commencement of

the actual oral hearing and therefore, the TAC determination is not time barred.

She further submitted that the Tax Appeals Commission Act does not spell out

any sanction for the failure on the part of the TAC to comply with the time limit

set out in section 10 of the Act. Her contention was that the word shall in

section 10 does not necessarily mean that the provision is mandatory unless

non-observance will result in the object of the provision being frustrated and the

sanction is statutorily spelled out in the Tax Appeals Commission Act.

Statutory Provisions

[11] The time limit for the determination of the appeal by the TAC was originally

contained in section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011,

which stipulated that the Tax Appeals Commission shall make the determination

7

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

within a period of one hundred and eighty days from the date of the

commencement of the hearing of the appeal. It reads as follows:

The Commission shall hear all appeals received by it and make its decision in respect thereof, within one hundred and eighty days from the date of the commencement of the hearing of the appeal.

[12] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act was amended by section 7

of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 4 of 2012, which

stipulated that the determination of the Commission shall be made within two

hundred and seventy days. In terms of section 13 of the said Act, the amendment

was to have retrospective effect and was deemed to have come into force from

the date of the Principal Act (i.e. 31.01.2011). Section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act was further amended by section 7 of the Tax Appeals

Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013, which stipulated that the

determination of the Commission shall be made within two hundred and seventy

days from the date of the commencement of its sittings for the hearing of each

such appeal. In terms of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 4

of 2012 (s. 13) and the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of

2013 (s. 14), the amendments made to the provision of section 10 were given

retrospective effect.

[13] Section 15 of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013

further provides an avoidance of doubt clause as follows:

For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby declared, that the Commission shall have the power in accordance with the provisions of the principal enactment as amended by this Act, to hear and determine any appeal that was deemed transferred to the Commission under section 10 of the principal enactment, notwithstanding the expiry of the twelve months granted for its determination by that section prior to its amendment by this Act.

[14] Accordingly, section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011

as last amended by the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of

2013 now provides as follows:

The Commission shall hear all appeals received by it and make its determination in respect thereof, within two hundred and seventy days from the date of the commencement of its sittings for the hearing of each such appeal:

8

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

Provided that, all appeals pending before the respective Board or Boards of Review in terms of the provisions of the respective enactments specified in Column I of Schedule I, or Schedule II to this Act, notwithstanding the fact that such provisions are applicable to different taxable periods as specified therein shall with effect from the date of coming into operation of the provision of this Act be deemed to stand transferred to the Commission, and the Commission shall notwithstanding anything contained in any other written law make its determination in respect thereof, within twenty four months from the date on which the Commission shall commence its sittings for the hearing of each such appeal.

[15] The question that arose for decision in Mohideen v. Commissioner-General

of Inland Revenue (supra), was whether the commencement of the time bar as

contemplated in section 140 (10) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 will

operate from the date on which the Appellant submitted to the jurisdiction of

the Board of Review according to the Appellant, on receipt of the Petition of

Appeal by the Board or from the date of the oral hearing. Section 140 (10) of

the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 as amended by section 52 of the Inland

Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 37 of 2003 contained 2 provisos, and the

intention as regards time limit is reflected in the second proviso to section 140

(10), which reads as follows:

Provided, however, the Board shall make its determination or express its opinion as the case may be, within two years from the date of commencement of the hearing of such appeal.

[16] The submission of the Appellant in that case was that the legislative intention was to dispose of both appeals within a total period of four years and the time limit of 2 years will begin to operate from the date on which the Petition of Appeal is received by the Board of Review, and not from the date of the oral hearing. The State argued however that the legislative intention by the use of the word hearing in section 140(10) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 means an oral hearing and no more. His Lordship Gooneratne J. answered this question at pp. 176-177 as follows:

It is very unfortunate that it took almost 6 years or more to reach its conclusion from the date of filing the Petition of Appeal in the Board. But the oral hearing commenced on 21.06.2006. This of course is well within the time limit and I would go to the extent to state that the Board has been very conscious of early disposal of the appeal. The Board cannot be faulted for getting the appeal fixed for hearing as stated above, since it is the duty and function of the Secretary of the Board to fix a date and time for hearing and to notify the parties. If it was the intention of the legislature that hearing

9

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

should be concluded within 2 years from the date of filing the petition or that the time period of 2 years begins to run from the date of filing the petition, there could not have been a difficult to make express provision, in that regard. I do agree with the view of the State Counsel. Hearing no doubt commences from the date of oral hearing. I would as such answer this question in favour of the Respondent and endorse the view of the Board of Review. It is not time barred as the Board arrived at the determination within 2 years. [Emphasis added]. [17] For those reasons, His Lordship Gooneratne J. having considered the question involved (Question No. 2), held with the Respondent on the basis that the hearing for the calculation of time limit of 2 years specified in section 140 (10) commences from the date of the oral hearing and not from the date of filing of the petition of appeal. I have no reason to deviate from the view taken by Gooneratne, J. in Mohideen v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra). I hold that when the legislation provides that when the Commission shall hear all appeals received by it and make its determination, within two hundred and seventy days of the time of the commencement of the hearing of the appeal [(prior to the Tax Appeal Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013)], the hearing commences from the date of oral hearing.

[18] The oral hearing in the present case commenced on 14.02.2017 and the determination was made by the TAC on 28.08.2017 and therefore, the determination of the appeal by the TAC is not time barred in terms of section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 as amended by the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 04 of 2012.

Mandatory-directory classification

[19] I will now turn to the submission made by Mrs. Jameel that, in any event,

the word "shall used in section 10 is normally to be interpreted as connoting a

(directory) and not mandatory provision. She submitted that the effect of any

breach does not render the determination invalid in the absence of any

consequences being specified in the legislation. Her submission was that the

TAC does not spell out any sanction for the failure on the part of the Tax Appeals

Commission to comply with the time limit set out in section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act. She invited us to hold that the time limit set out in section 10

of the Tax Appeals Commission Act is only directory, and not mandatory.

[20] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act stipulates that the Tax Appeals Commission shall make its determination within 270 days of the commencement of the hearing of the appeal. Superficially, the effects of non-

10

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

compliance of a provision are dealt with in terms of the mandatory-directory classification. Generally, in case of a mandatory provision, the act done in breach thereof is void, whereas, in case of a directory provision, the act does not become void, although some other consequences may follow (P.M. Bakshi, Interpretation of Statutes, First Ed, 2008). But, the use of the word shall does not always mean that the provision is obligatory or mandatory, as it depends upon the context in which the word shall occurs and the other circumstances (Vide-Indian Supreme Court case of The Collector of Monghyr v. Keshan Prasad Goenka, AIR 1962 SC 1694 at p. 1701).

[21] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 (as amended)

does not say what will happen if the TAC fails to make the determination within

the time limit specified in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23

of 2011 (as amended). It is true that the absence of any provision does not

necessarily follow that the statutory provision is intended by the legislature to

be disregarded or ignored. Where the sanction for not obeying them in every

particular statute is not prescribed, the court must judicially determine whether

the legislature intended that the failure to observe any provision of a Statute

would render an act null and void or leave it intact (see also, N.S. Bindras

Interpretation of Statute, 10th Ed. p. 1013).

[22] The question as to whether a statute is mandatory or directory is a question

which has to be adjudged in the light of the intention of the Legislature as

disclosed by the object, purpose and scope of the statute. If the statute is

mandatory, the act or thing done, not in the manner or form prescribed can have

no effect or validity, and if it is a directory, a penalty may be incurred for non-

compliance, but the act or thing done is regarded as good (P.M. Bakshi,

Interpretation of Statutes, p. 430 & Mohanlal Ganpatram v. Shri SayajiJubliee

Cotton and Jute Mills Co. Ltd AIR 1966 Guj. 96). In State of U.P., v. Baburam

Upadhya, reported in AIR 1961 SC 751, the Supreme Court of India said that

when a statute uses the word shall, prima facie, it is mandatory, but the Court

may ascertain the real intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the

whole scope of the statute.

[23] In the absence of any express provision, the intention of the legislature is to

be ascertained by weighing the consequences of holding a statute to be

directory or mandatory, having regard to the importance of the provision in

relation to the general object intended to be secured by the Act [(Caldow v.

Pixcell (1877) 1 CPD 52, 566) & Dharendra Kriisna v. Nihar Ganguly (AIR 1943 Cal.

11

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

266)]. As held in Attorney General's Reference (No 3 of 1999), the emphasis

ought to be on the consequences of non-compliance, and asking the question

whether Parliament can fairly be taken to have intended total invalidity.

[24] Although the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 (as amended)

was amended by Parliament twice and increased the period within which the

appeal is to be determined by the Commission from 200 days to 270 days with

retrospective effect, the legislature in its wisdom did not specify any penal

consequence or any other consequence of non-compliance of the time bar

specified in section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act. Had the legislature

intended that the non-compliance with section 10 to be mandatory, it could have

easily included a provision with negative words requiring that an act shall be

done in no other manner or at no other time than that designated in the section

or a provision for a penal consequence or other consequence of non-

compliance.

[25] The object sought to be attained by section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act has been designed primarily to expedite the appeal process

filed before the Tax Appeals Commission, which was established by an Act of

Parliament, and the Commission shall comprise retired Judges of the Supreme

Court or the Court of Appeal, and those who have gained wide knowledge and

eminence in the field of Taxation.

[26] The legislature has, from time to time, extended and reduced the time

period within which the appeal shall be determined by the Tax Appeals

Commission, but it intentionally and purposely refrained from imposing any

consequence for the failure on the part of the Tax Appeals Commission to adhere

to the time limit specified in section 10. It is crystal clear that these procedural

time limit rules have been devised by the legislature to facilitate the appeal

process by increasing and reducing the time period within which such appeals

shall be concluded. The provision for the determination of an appeal by the TAC

within a period of 270 days from the commencement of its sittings for the

hearing of an appeal. It has been designed to regulate the duties of the Tax

Appeals Commission by specifying a time limit for its performance as specified

in section 10 of the Act.

[27] The legislature could not have intended that the time limit specified in

section 10 is mandatory when the parties had no control over those entrusted

with the task of making the determination under section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act. In Stafford Motor Company Limited v. The Commissioner

12

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

General of Inland Revenue (supra), Janak de Silva, J. held that the Tax Appeals

Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 (as amended) does not spell out any sanction

for the failure on the part of the Tax Appeals commission to comply with the

time limit set out in section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act.

[28] We took the same view in our judgments in Mr. S.P. Muttiah v. The

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, CA/TAX/46/2019, decided on

26.06.2021 and Amadeus Lanka (Pvt) Ltd v. CGIR (C.A Tax 4/19 decided on

30.07.2021. In Mr. S.P. Muttiah v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,

we further held that the directory interpretation of Section 10 is consistent with

the object, purpose and design of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, which is

reflected in the intention of the legislature. We held that if a gap is disclosed in

the Legislature, the remedy lies is an amending Act and not in a usurpation of

the legislative function under the thin disguise of interpretation.

[29] In S.P. Muttiah v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra), this

Court held at page 77 and 78;

If we interpret the legislative intent of Section 10 from its mere phraseology, without considering the nature, purpose, the design, the absence of consequences of non-compliance and practical impossibility, which would follow from construing it one way or the other, it will tend to defeat the overall object, design, the purpose and spirit of the Tax Appeals Commission Act.

[30] The directory interpretation of Section 10 is consistent with the object,

purpose and design of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, which is reflected in the

intention of the legislature. For those reasons, I hold that the determination of

the Tax Appeals Commission in the present case is not time barred and thus, I

answer the Question of Law No. 1 in favour of the Respondent.

Question of Law No. 2

Is the determination made by the Commissioner-General time barred in terms of

section 165(14) of the Inland Revenue Act?

[31] At the hearing, Dr. Felix submitted that the determination made by the

Commissioner General is time barred for the following reasons:

1. The petition of appeal to the Commissioner General was tendered on

24.12.2012 and the determination must be communicated to the taxpayer

13

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

prior to 23.12.2014. The determination was communicated to the Appellant

by letter dated 02.01.2015 and it was received by the Appellant on 06.01.2015.

Although the determination is dated 15.09.2014, there cannot be a valid

acknowledgement without communicating same to the tax payer, which

occurred only on 06.01.2015. The determination shall be deemed to have

been validly made on 06.01.2015 and accordingly, the determination which

was made on 06.01.2015 is time barred in terms of section 165(14) of the

Inland Revenue Act (as amended);

2. The purported acknowledgement of the appeal dated 07.01.2013 has been

signed by B.A.I.Wijesekara, assessor, Large Taxpayers Appeal Unit,

Department of Inland Revenue, who is not statutorily authorized to

acknowledge the appeal made to the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue. The appeal must be acknowledged either by the Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue himself, or by an officer who is lawfully delegated

with the power to do so. The Commissioner General is not statutorily

empowered to permit an assessor to acknowledge an appeal made to the

Commissioner General since it is a statutory function which can only be

delegated to a person who is statutorily empowered to act on behalf of the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue There is no valid acknowledgment

under section 165(6) of the Inland Revenue Act;

3. The assessor has no power to acknowledge the appeal in terms of section 208

read with sections 213, 217 of the Inland Revenue Act and therefore, no

acknowledgement has been made in terms of section 165 (6) of the Inland

Revenue Act and, therefore, the appeal shall be deemed to have been received

by the Commissioner-General on 24.12.2012;

4. As the determination has been served on the taxpayer on 06.01.2015, the

appeal has been made after the expiry of the period of 2 years from the date

on which the petition of appeal is received by the Commissioner General in

violation of section 165(14) of the Inland Revenue Act (as amended).

[32] On the other hand, Mrs. Jameel submitted that:

1. The relevant date for the purpose of calculating the time bar under section

165(14) of the Inland revenue Act is the date on which the CGIR makes the

determination and not the date of receipt by the Appellant of the

determination;

14

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

2. The appeal was acknowledged on 07.01.2013 and the determination was

made on 15.09.2014, which is well within the period of two years from

07.01.2013 in terms of section 165(14) of the Inland Revenue Act (as

amended) and the determination was forwarded to the Appellant and

admittedly, it was received by the Appellant;

3. The appeal was acknowledged by letter dated 07.01.2013 and the

determination was made on 15.09.2014 and therefore, the determination

has been made within a period of 2 years from the date of the

acknowledgement of the appeal in terms of section 165(14) read with

section165(5) of the Inland Revenue Act (as amended).

[33] Section 165 (6) of the Inland Revenue Act provides:

(6) The receipt of every appeal shall be acknowledged within thirty days of its receipt and where so acknowledged, the date of the letter of acknowledgement shall for the purpose of this section, be deemed to be the date of receipt of such appeal. Where however the receipt of any appeal is not so acknowledged, such appeal shall be deemed to have been received by the Commissioner-General on the day on which it is delivered to the Commissioner-General

[34] In terms of section 165 (6) of the Inland Revenue Act, the date of receipt of

appeal by the Commissioner-General shall be regarded as follows:

(a) If the receipt of the appeal is acknowledged within 30 days of its receipt,

the date of acknowledgement of the appeal shall be the date of receipt of

appeal;

(b) If the receipt of the appeal is not so acknowledged, the appeal shall be

deemed to have been received by the Commissioner-General on the date

on which the appeal is delivered to the Commissioner-General.

[35] Where the receipt of the appeal is not shown to have been acknowledged

within 30 days of its receipt, the effect is that the appeal shall be deemed to have

been received by the Commissioner-General on the date on which the appeal is

delivered to the Commissioner-General (i.e. 24.12.2012).

Date of Acknowledgement of Appeal

15

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[36] There is no dispute that the Appellant has delivered the appeal to the

Commissioner-General on 24.12.2012 under section 165 (1) of the Inland

Revenue Act. The assessor B.A.L.I. Wijesekara (assessor, Unit 10) acknowledged

the appeal by communication dated 07.01.2013, which states that the appeal

made by letter dated 24.12.2002 is acknowledged by letter dated 07.01.2013

and therefore the period of 2 years within which the appeal shall be determined

will end on 05.01.2015. Dr. Felixs argument during the hearing was that the

acknowledgement letter should have been signed by the Commissioner-General

himself or by an officer who is lawfully delegated with the power to do so, but

the assessor has no power to acknowledge the appeal.

[37] ] At the hearing, Mrs. Jameel heavily relied on the decision of this Court in

Lanka Asok Leyland PLC v. The Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (CA

Tax No. 14/2017) in support of her contention that the Commissioner-General

needs not himself sign the acknowledgement, which is only an administrative

task. In Lanka Asok Leyland PLC v. The Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue

(Supra), the identical issue arose whether the acknowledgement of the appeal

should have been signed by the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue

himself and if the appeal is not so acknowledged, whether the appeal shall be

deemed to have been received by the Commissioner-General on the day on

which it is delivered to the Commissioner-General. The Court of Appeal held that

although the appeal has to be submitted to the commissioner-General, there is

no requirement that the acknowledgement must be made by the Commissioner-

General himself. His Lordship Janak de Silva, J. stated at page 6:

Court is of the view that there is no merit in the submission of the Appellant that the acknowledgement must be signed by the Respondent. The functions of the Inland Revenue Department are so multifarious that no Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue could ever personally attend to all of them. In particular, Court will be slow to impose such requirements unless there is unequivocal language in the IR Act. It is true that the appeal has to be submitted to the respondent. However, that does not mean that the acknowledgement to be made by the respondent. Similar approach has been taken by our Courts in applying the Carltona principle in relation to administrative functions to be performed by Ministers (M.S.Perera v. Forest Department and another [(1982) 1 Sri. L.R. 187] amd Kuruppu v. Keerthir Rajapakse, Conservator of Forests [(1982) 1 Sri. L.R. 163].

[38] The question of acknowledgement falls entirely within the purview of

section 165 (6) of the Inland Revenue Act, which stipulates the period within

16

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

which the receipt of the appeal shall be acknowledged, and where so

acknowledged or not acknowledged, as the case may be, the consequences

thereof. On a careful reading of section 165 (6), it is patently clear that it does

not state in unequivocal language that the Commissioner-General himself

should sign the acknowledgement, and if it is not so acknowledged, the date of

the letter of acknowledgement shall for the purpose of section 165 (6), be

deemed to be the date of the receipt of such appeal.

[39] In Polycrome Electrical Industries (Pvt) Ltd, v The Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue, CA/TAX/0049/2019, decided on 26.03.2021, this Court held:

[19] In this modern-day administration, with expansion of powers and multifarious functions exercised by public officers, the Commissioner-General cannot be expected, as the head of the Inland Revenue Department to attend to all and perform each and every function himself. As there may be thousands of taxpayers in Sri Lanka, it cannot be expected that the Commissioner-General shall perform each and every task himself, unless the Inland Revenue Act itself has specifically empowered to him to exercise such function personally I do not see any such intention reflected in the language, scope or object of section 165 (6) of the Act. I do not think that the Parliament intended such a result.

[40] The Appellant relies on section 208 of the Inland Revenue Act and argues

that the assessor is not included in that section and, therefore, the senior

Assessor cannot acknowledge the appeal. On that basis, the Appellant argues

that the purported acknowledgement is not a valid acknowledgement. Section

208 (2) and 208(4) of the Inland Revenue Act provides:

(2) A Senior Deputy Commissioner-General or a deputy Commissioner-general or a Senior Commissioner or Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner exercising or performing or discharging any power, duty or function conferred or imposed on or assigned to the Commissioner-General by any provision of this Act, shall be deemed for all purposes to be authorized to exercise, perform or discharge that power, duty or function until the contrary is proved.

(4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other provisions of this Act, a Senior Assessor or Assistant Commissioner of Inland revenue or an Assessor or Assistant Commissioner of Inland Revenue shall not-

(a) act under setion 163;or

17

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

(b) reach any agreement or make any adjustment to any assessment made under subsection (7) of section 165,

except with the written approval of the Commissioner-General or any Commissioner.

[41] The acknowledgement was issued by the Senior Assessor under section 165

(6), and not under section 163 or 165(7) of the Inland Revenue Act and the

acknowledgement of the appeal under section 165(6) is not caught under section

208 of the Inland Revenue Act. The question of acknowledgement falls entirely

within the purview of section 165 (6) of the Inland Revenue Act, which stipulates

the period within which the receipt of the appeal shall be acknowledged and

where so acknowledged or not acknowledged, as the case may be, the

consequences thereof. Section 165(6) does not specify who should acknowledge

the appeal, which is only an administrative act performed on behalf of the

Commissioner-General.

Delegation of Power

[42] The intention of the legislature in a taxation statute is to be gathered from

the words or language used in the provision and accordingly, it is not possible to

assume any intention or governing purpose of the statute, more than what is

stated in the plain language (P. M. Bakshi, Interpretation of Statutes, 1st Ed. 2011,

p. 512). The question of delegation of authority, however, arises where the

Commissioner-General entrusts or delegates another with authority by

empowering such other person to act or do things which otherwise, he himself

would have to do. In Sidhartha Sarawagi v. Board of Trustees for the Port of

Kolkata and others [(2014) 16 SCC 248], the Indian Supreme Court, while dealing

with the issue of delegation of authority, has observed:

2-Delegation is the act of making or commissioning a delegate. It generally means of powers by the person who grants the delegation and conferring of an authority to do things which otherwise that person would have to do himself. Delegation is defined in Blacks Law Dictionary as the act of entrusting another with authority by empowering another to act as an agent or representative. Delegation generally means parting of powers by the person who grants the delegation, but it also means conferring of an authority to do things which otherwise that person would have to do himself.

18

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[43] Mathew J. in Gwalior Rayon Silk Manufacturing (Wvg.) Co. Ltd. v. The

Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax and others, 1974 AIR 1660, has succinctly

discussed the concept of delegation at paragraph 37:

37-Delegation may be defined as the entrusting, by a person to another person or body of persons, of the exercise of a power residing in that person or body of persons, to another person or body of persons, with complete power of revocation or amendment remaining in the grantor or delegator. It is important to grasp the implications of this, for, much confusion of thought has unfortunately resulted from assuming that delegation involves or may involve, the complete abdication or abrogation of a power. This is precluded by the definition. Delegation often involves the granting of discretionary authority to another, but such authority is purely derivative. The ultimate power always remains in the delegator and is never renounced [Emphasis added]..

[44] A Statute will generally provide the answer as to whether a power must be

performed personally by those to whom they have been given or whether such

power can be delegated to another. As noted, there is no express provision in

the Inland Revenue Act that authorises the Commissioner-General to sign the

acknowledgement of the appeal personally or delegate his power to another

officer of the department authorizing him to sign the acknowledgement. The

question is whether a delegation of power can be implied from the scheme and

objects of the Act and the character of the power to be delegated and the

circumstances when the power is able to be exercised. The nature of the duty to

be exercised here is merely to acknowledge the appeal and the character of the

person involved is the Commissioner-General who is the head of the

Department.

[45] In Polycrome Electrical Industries (Pvt) Ltd, v The Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue, (supra), this Court held:

[24] As there may be thousands of taxpayers in Sri Lanka, the head of the Department of Income tax cannot be expected to discharge personally all the duties of administrative nature which can be performed by the officials of the Department in in exercise of statutory powers referred to in section 165 (6). I do not think that the acknowledgement signed by the officials of the Department acting under authorization of their superior officers in the exercise of the statutory duty conferred by section 165 (6) are invalid where no express or implied delegation of authority authorizing the officials to sign the acknowledgement is reflected in the scheme of the Inland Revenue Act. I do not think that the Parliament intended such a result.

19

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[46] Greene, M.R. in Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioners of Works, (supra) explained

broadly the principle at page 560, as follows:

In the administration of government in this country, the functions which are given to ministers (and constitutionally properly given to ministers, because they are constitutionally responsible) are functions so multifarious that no minister could ever personally attend to them. To make the example of the present case, no doubt there have been thousands of requisitions in this country by individual ministries. It cannot be supposed that this regulation meant that in each case, the minister in person should direct his mind to the matter. The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers given to ministers are normally exercised under the authority of the ministers by responsible officials of the department. Public business could not be carried on if that were not the case. Constitutionally, the decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister. The minister is responsible. It is he who must answer before Parliament for anything that his officials have done under his authority, and, if for an important matter he selected an official of such junior standing that he could not be expected competently to perform the work, the minister would have to answer for that in Parliament. The whole system of departmental organisation and administration is based on the view that ministers, being responsible to Parliament, will see that important duties are committed to experienced officials. If they do not do that, Parliament is the place where complaint must be made against them".[Emphasis added].

[47] The Carltona doctrine thus, applies where a statute has conferred a power

on a Minister, and it is practically impossible for the Minister to exercise such

power personally, he may, in general, act through a duly authorised officer of

his department without having a formal delegation to do so. It recognises the

principle that the functions of a Minister are so multifarious that the business

of government could not be carried on if he were required to exercise all his

powers personally. Thus, the official is treated as the ministers alter ego, and to

that extent, his decision is regarded as those of the Minister.

[48] It is to be noted that the Carltona principle does not confine to Ministers

and it has been judicially recognised in the Commissioners of Customs and

Excise v. Cure & Deeley Ltd. (1962) 1 QB 340 at p 371 that the Commissioners

of Customs and Excise were in a position parallel to that of Ministers:

The Commissioners are in a position parallel to that of the Ministers referred to in the judgment of Lord Greene in the Carltona case [1943] 2 All ER 560 at 563, in that their functions are so multifarious that they could never personally attend to them all, and the powers given to them are normally

20

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

exercised under their authority by responsible officials of the department.[45].

[49] In Re Golden Chemical Products Ltd. (1976) Ch. 300 at p. 20, it was observed:

Yet I find the logic of the principle equally persuasive in its application to the head of any large government department, and, a fortiori, to a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation responsible within a State for the implementation of the Commonwealth's laws with respect to taxation. No permanent head of a department in the Public Service is expected to discharge personally all the duties which are performed in his name and for which he is accountable to the responsible Minister.

[50] Those authorities established that when a Minister is entrusted with

administrative functions he may, in general, act through a duly authorised officer

of his department. The same principle applies to the Commissioner-General of

Inland Revenue, who as the head of a department is not expected to discharge

personally all the duties otherwise through his responsible officers where the

relevant power, duty or function is of an administrative nature or routine.

[51] It is patently clear that the assessor has only performed an administrative

function conferred by section 165 (6) of the Act and signed the

acknowledgement letter, which is only an administrative act, acting under and

on behalf of the Commissioner-General rather than performing any discretionary

power in terms of the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act. In the result, the

absence of any reference in the acknowledgement letter that the assessor signed

the acknowledgement for and on behalf of the Commissioner-General or that

the assessor was specifically delegated by the Commissioner General to sign on

his behalf will not make the acknowledgement of the appeal invalid.

[52] I am of the view that the appeal has been validly acknowledged within 30

days of its receipt as required by section 165 (6) of the Inland Revenue Act and

accordingly, the date of the acknowledgement viz. 07.01.2013 shall, for the

purpose of section 165 (6) of the Inland Revenue Act, be deemed to be the date

of the receipt of the appeal made to the Commissioner-General

[53] The next question raised by Dr. Felix was that as the petition of appeal was

submitted on 24.12.2012 but the determination was communicated to the

Appellant on 06.01.2015 and therefore, the appeal has been lawfully determined

after the expiry of the period of 2 years from the receipt of the appeal tendered

21

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

to the CGIR on 24.12.2012. Section 165 (14) of the Inland Revenue Act reads as

follows:

Every petition of appeal preferred under this section, shall be agreed to or determined by the Commissioner- General, within a period of two years from the date on which such petition of appeal is received by the Commissioner- General, unless the agreement or determination or such appeal depends on

(a) the decision of a competent court on any matter relating to or connected with or arising from such appeal and referred to it by the Commissioner- General or the appellant; or

(b) the furnishing of any document or the taking of any action

(i) by the appellant, upon being required to do so by an Assessor or Assistant Commissioner or the Commissioner-General by notice given in writing to such appellant (such notice being given not later than six months prior to the expiry of two years from the date on which the petition of appeal is received by the Commissioner-General); or

(ii) by any other person, other than the Commissioner-General or an Assessor or Assistant Commissioner.

Where such appeal is not agreed to or determined within such period, the appeal shall be deemed to have been allowed and tax charged accordingly.

[54] Dr. Felix contended that the determination is not completed or made until

it is communicated to the person to be affected by the determination and as it

was communicated to the Appellant by letter dated 06.01.2015, the

determination is time barred. I am not inclined to agree with Dr. Felixs

contention. All what is required under section 165 (14) is that the determination

of the Commissioner-General shall be made within a period of 2 years from the

date on which such petition of appeal is received by the Commissioner-General.

It is not envisaged in section 165 (14) that the determination shall also be

communicated to the Appellant within a period of 2 years from the date on

which such petition of appeal is received. If it was the legislative intent, it shall

be stated in unequivocal language in section 165 (14).

[55] There is a clear distinction between a determination of the appeal and

communication of appeal, and they are two different things or steps at different

22

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

stages. The former is the determination of the confirmation, reduction, increase

or annulment of the assessment made by the Respondent and the latter is the

formal intimation to the Appellant of the fact that such a determination has

been made.

[56] I am of the view that the date of the determination could not be taken as

the date of the communication as communication presupposes determination

of a thing to be communicated to the Appellant. This Court in Stafford Motor

Company (Pvt) Limited v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue, CA Tax

17/17 decided on 15.03.2018 considered a similar point. In that case, the Court

considered whether a lawfully valid assessment can be made without serving a

valid notice of assessment or whether there is a requirement to give notice of

assessment before making an assessment. The Court held that there is no

requirement to give notice of assessment before making an assessment as

practically it cannot be done as the assessment must first be made followed by

a notice of assessment. His Lordship Janak de Silva, J at page 8 stated:

Section 163(1) and (2) of the 2006 Act provide for making of assessment of any person while section 164 requires a notice of assessment to be given to a person who has been so assessed. Therefore, Court rejects the submission made by the learned counsel for the Appellant that no lawfully valid assessment can be made without first serving a valid notice of assessment. There is no requirement to give notice of assessment before making an assessment. Practically, it cannot be done as the assessment must first be made followed by a notice of assessment...

The time bar to making of an assessment is set out in section 163(5) of the 2006 Act. The section clearly states that no assessment shall be made after the time specified therein. Given that the 2006 Act recognizes a distinction between an assessment and a notice of assessment, it would have been convenient for the legislature to refer to the notice of assessment rather than assessment in section 163(5) of the 2006 Act. On the contrary, it has been made effective for the posting of the notice of assessment is the relevant date for the purpose of determining the time bar making an assessment. Court determines that the date of making the assessment is the relevant date for the purpose of determining the time bar.

[57] As noted, the appeal has been made on 24.12.2012 and it has been lawfully

acknowledged on 07.01.2013 and thus, the date of the time bar as stated in the

acknowledgement is 07.01.2013. The determination has been made on

15.09.2014 and the said determination has been communicated to the

23

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

Appellant on 15.09.2016 (vide-page 101). The Commissioner by letter dated

15.09.2014 communicated the said determination to the Appellant under

Registered post (p. 101 of the TAC brief). It is patently clear that the

determination has been made within a period of 2 years from the date on which

the petition of appeal was acknowledged by the Commissioner-General under

section 165(14) of the Inland revenue Act.

[58] For the reasons stated above, the question of law No. 2 should be answered

in favour of the Respondent.

Question of Law No. 3

Time Bar of the Assessment

[59] At the hearing, Dr. Felix submitted that the assessment made by the assessor

is time barred by operation of the law for the following reasons:

1. The intimation letter is dated 26.11.2012 and the notice of assessment is dated

30.11.2012, and the notice of assessment was received by the Appellant on

18.12.2012 (p. 49 of the TAC brief);

2. The assessment has been made on 30.11.2012 for the year of assessment

2009/2010 and the assessment (received on 06.12.2012) and the notice of

assessment (received on18.12.2012) has been received by the Appellant after

the expiry of the statutory period for making an assessment under section

163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act (as amended);

3. A lawfully valid assessment can only be made if it is served on the taxpayer

prior to the expiry of the statutory time bar for making the assessment and

the reasons for making the assessment must also be served on the taxpayer

prior to the expiry of the time bar;

4. It is the notice of assessment which gives validity to the assessment and the

failure to send a notice of appeal within the statutorily contemplated period

would result in the assessment being devoid of legal effect.

5. Assuming without conceding that the assessment was made on 26.11.2012,

as asserted by the Respondent, the appeal would nevertheless be time barred

for the year of assessment 2009/2010 for the failure to make the assessment

24

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

on or before 31.03.2012 when the assessment was made on 26.11.2012 in

contravention of section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No.

19 of 2019, which does not provide that the amendment made to section

163(5) had retrospective effect. Thus, the assessor could not have extended

the time period for making the assessment beyond 31.03.2012 for the year of

assessment 2009/2010 on the basis of the Inland Revenue (Amenment) Act)

No. 22 of 2011, which applied to any year of assessment commencing from

01.04.2011.

[60] During the course of the further argument, Dr. Felix strongly relied on the

judgment of the Court of Appeal in A. M. Ismail v. Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (1980) IV Sri Lanka Tax Cases 156, D.M.S. Fernando and another v. A.M.

Ismail (1982) Sri Lanka Tax cases, Vol IV 156, p. 184, Chettinad Corporation Ltd

(1954) 1 CTC 515 and Wijewardene v. Kathiragamar (1991) IV Sri Lanka Tax Cases

313, in particular, in support of his contention. He further relied on the decisions

of the Court of Appeal in John Keels Holdings PLC v. Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue (CA Tax 26/2013 decided on 16.03.2022 and ACL Cables v.

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CA Tax 07/2013 decided on 16.03.2022

which held that whilst making an assessment and sending a notice of assessment

are two different things, a valid assessment cannot be made in time unless the

notice of assessment is served on the tax payer.

[61] The learned Senior Additional Solicitor General however, strenuously

contended that there is a clear difference between the making of the assessment

and the notice of assessment, and the time bar relates to the making of the

assessment, and not to the service of the notice of assessment. He argued that

there can be no notice without an actual and valid assessment, which precedes

the notice and the assessment, and therefore, it is in no way dependent on the

notice or the service thereafter. He relied on the decisions in Honig & Others

(Administrators of Emmanuel Honig) v. Sarsfield (H. M. Inspector of Taxes) Ch.

Div. (1985) STR 31 (CA) /(CA) (1986) STC 246), Commissioner of Income Tax v.

Chettinand Corporation, 55 NLR 556 and Stafford Motors v. Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue CA Tax 17/2017 decided on 15.03.2019, which held

that the making of assessment and serving of the notice of assessment are two

different acts.

[62] The questions to be considered are:

25

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

1. Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of this case, the assessment

for the assessment year 2009-2010 was made on 26.11.2012 or the service of the notice of assessment dated 29.11.2012 on the Appellant on 18.12.2012 constituted a valid assessment;

2. Even if the assessment was made on 26.11.2012, whether, on the facts and

in the circumstances of this case, the assessment for the assessment year 2009-2010 was time barred in terms of section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act (as amended).

Whether the assessment has been validly made on or before 26.11.2012 or a

lawfully valid assessment has only been made when the notice of assessment

dated 30.11.2012 was served on the taxpayer

[63] I shall consider the first question, whether the assessment has been made

on or before 26.11.2012 or the service of the notice of assessment dated

29.11.2013 on the taxpayer constitutes a valid assessment in terms of the

provisions of the Inland Revenue Act (as amended).

Best judgment of the assessment-section 163

[64] Section 163 of the Inland Revenue Act, No 10 of 2006 (as amended) relates

to the power of the assessor to make an assessment (i) using the best judgment

rule by performing the duties honestly and above board; (ii) considering fairly all

material put before it; (iii) considering the material that is in possession

reasonably and not arbitrarily; and (iv) without being required to do the work of

the taxpayer (See- Van Boeckel v C&E QB [1981] STC 290; VAEC 1420). Section

163(1) reads as follows:

(1) Where any person who in the opinion of an Assessor or Assistant

Commissioner is liable to any income tax for any year of assessment, has not paid such tax or has paid an amount less than the proper amount which he ought to have paid as such tax for such year of assessment, an Assessor Assistant Commissioner may, subject to the provisions of subsection (3) and (5) and after the fifteenth day of November immediately succeeding that year of assessment, assess the amount which in the judgment of the Assessor Assistant Commissioner ought to have been paid by such person, and shall by notice in writing require such person to pay forthwith

(a) the amount of tax so assessed, if such person has not paid any tax for that

year of assessment; or

26

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

(b) the difference between the amount of tax so assessed and the amount of

tax paid by such person for that year of assessment, if such person has paid any amount as tax for that year of assessment:

Provided that an Assessor or Assistant Commissioner may, subject to the provisions of subsections (3) and (5), assess any person for any year of assessment at any time prior to the fifteenth day of November immediately succeeding that year of assessment, if he is of opinion that such person is about to leave Sri Lanka or that it is expedient to do so for the protection of revenue, and require such person to pay such tax to the Commissioner-General earlier than as required under subsection (1) of section 113:

Provided further that any assessment in relation to the tax payable by a company under sub-paragraph (i) of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 61 or paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 61 or paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 62 shall be made after the expiry of thirty days from the due date for payment of such tax.

[65] It is manifest that section 163 (1) imposes the following duties on the assessor:

1. First to make an assessment (amount of tax which such person in the judgment of the assessor, ought to have paid for that taxable period (making the assessment); and

2. Send the notice in writing requiring the taxpayer to pay such amount forthwith (sending the notice).

[66] On the other hand, section 163(2) applies to an additional assessment to be made by an assessor where the assessor is of the opinion that a person chargeable with tax has paid as tax, an amount less than the proper amount of the tax payable by him or chargeable from him for that taxable period. In such case, the assessor may make an additional assessment and give such person notice of the assessment. It reads as follows:

Where it appears to an Assessor or Assistant Commissioner that any person liable to income tax for any year of assessment, has been assessed at less than the proper amount, the Assessor or Assistant Commissioner may, subject to the provisions of subsection (3) and subsection (5), assess such person at the additional amount at which according to his opinion such person ought to have been assessed, and the provisions of this Act as to notice of assessment, appeal and other proceedings shall apply to such additional assessment and to the tax charged there under.

27

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[67] Section 163(1) imposes a duty on the assessor to make the assessment and section 163(2) imposes an assessor to make an additional assessment. Section 163(3) deals with the duties of the assessor in making an assessment or additional assessment and steps to be taken where the return is either accepted or not accepted. It reads as follows:

163(3). Where a person has furnished a return of income, the Assessor or Assistant Commissioner may in making an assessment on such person under subsection (1) or under subsection (2), either

(a) accept the return made by such person; or

(b) if he does not accept the return made by that person, estimate the amount of the assessable income of such person and assess him accordingly:

Provided that where an Assessor or Assistant Commissioner does not accept a return made by any person for any year of assessment and makes an assessment or additional assessment on such person for that year of assessment, he shall communicate to such person in writing his reasons for not accepting the return.

[68] Section 164 requires the assessor who made the assessment to give notice of assessment to each person and each partnership who or which has been assessed, stating the amount of income assessed and the amount of tax charged. It reads as follows:

164. As Assessor or Assistant Commissioner shall give notice of assessment to each person and each partnership who or which has been assessed, stating the amount of income assessed and the amount of tax charged:

Provided that where such notice is given to an employer under the provisions of Chapter XIV, it shall be sufficient to state therein the amount of tax charged.

[69] The making of the assessment is, thus, different from sending the notice of

assessment as there can be no notice without an assessment which precedes the

notice. Accordingly, the assessment is not dependent on the notice of

assessment and the notice of assessment arises only upon the making of the

assessment (See-further the decision of Stafford Motor Company (Private)

Limited v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue CA Tax 17/2017, decided on

15.03.1919, Illukkumbura v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, CA/Tax

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[70] The Appellant relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in A. M. Ismail

v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra) and part of the passage from

the judgment of Samarakoon C.J in D.M.S. Fernando and another v. A.M. Ismail

(supra), in support of its argument that the notice must be sent to the taxpayer

prior to the expiry of the time bar. In A.M.Ismail v Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue (supra), Victor Perera J. stated at p. 182:

It is necessary that the respondents should realise that the specific duties imposed on them as these provisions have been repeated in the Inland Revenue Act, No. 28 of 1979, which is the law now in operation in the year commencing 1st April, 1978, so that the Inland Revenue Department could recover the tax found to be due from taxpayers with expedition as provided in this law without jeopardising the rights of the State to collect the revenue due to it. The law given to an Assessor, a period of 3 years to examine and investigate a return while an assessee keeps on paying the tax installments on the specified dates.

In regard to the date of the notice of assessment, it was conceded that the relevant date is the date of posting as a notice sent by post shall be deemed to have been served on the day succeeding the day on which it would have been received in the ordinary course of business. In this case, the notice was admittedly posted on 31st April, 1979, long after the effective date referred to in section 96 (C) (3), namely 31st March 1979 1979. In this case it cannot be considered a valid notice under section 96(C) (3) or even a valid notice under section 95 as there has been an absolute non-compliance with the mandatory provisions of section 93(2) even if the assessment was made on 30.03.1979. . [71] Accordingly, the Court of Appeal issued a writ of certiorari quashing the

assessment of tax. Now it is necessary to consider the facts and circumstances

under which Victor Perera, J. stated that that notice of assessment was not a valid

notice of assessment under section 93(2) of the Inland Revenue (Amendment)

Act, No. 30 of 1978. In M.Ismail v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

(supra), the taxpayer submitted his return and in August, 1977 and had an

interview with the assessor. Thereafter, the taxpayer, by letter dated 10.08.1977,

forwarded a statement disclosing an additional income and other information

with a view to finalising his income tax matters with an explanation for non-

disclosure of this additional income earlier. The taxpayer had another interview

with the assessor in January 1978 and in October, 1978. The taxpayer made

payments towards settling the liability arising from the additional income

disclosed., but after the interview with the Deputy Commssioner in October,

1978, the taxpayer received no further communication.

29

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[72] In 1979, the taxpayer received a notice of assessment dated 30.03.1979

showing a larger amount of assessable income and wealth than was returned or

declared by him and the said notice of assessment was posted on 21.04.1979.

Under such circumstances, the taxpayer sought a writ of certiorari and/for

prohibition quashing this assessment. The Revenue (Respondents) relied on a

copy of a letter dated 04.04.1979 allegedly sent by the assessor to the taxpayer

stating reasons for rejecting the returns and accounts have already been

intimated to you The Respondents were however, unable to prove that such

a letter was sent to the taxpayer, or to give evidence as to how and when the

letter was sent. The Respondents also filed an affidavit which stated, inter alia,

that at these in his return and statement for the relevant year of assessment will

not be accepted.

[73] Section 93(2) of the Inland Revenue Act, 04 of 1963 reads as follows:

Where a person has furnished a return of income, wealth or gifts, the assessor may (a) either accept the return and make an assessment accordingly; (b) if he does not accept the return, estimate the amount of the assessable income, taxable wealth or taxable gifts of such person and assess him accordingly, and communicate to such person in writing the reasons for not accepting the return.

[74] By the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 30 of 1978, section 93(2) was

amended, and it made it obligatory for the assessor to communicate to the

assessee in writing the reasons for not accepting the return. Section 93(C)(3)

reads as follows:

Where, in the opinion of the Assessor, any person chargeable with any tax.has paid as the quarterly instalment of that tax..an amount less that the proper amount which he ought to have paid.the Assessor may assess the amount which in the judgment of the Assessor ought to have been paid by such person and shall by notice in writing require such person to pay forthwith the difference between the amount so assessed and the amount paid by that person.

[75] The proviso (d) to section 96(C)(3) reads as follows:

Where an assessor does not accept a return made by any person for any year of assessment and makes an assessment on that persons for that year of

30

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

assessment, he shall communicate to such a [erson in writing his reasons for not accepting the return. [76] It was absolutely clear that after the two interviews were held and the

additional income and other information with an explanation for not disclosing

them earlier, were sent to the assessor by the taxpayer, the assessor did not

communicate in writing with his reasons for not accepting the return as required

by section 93(2) of the Act. The Respondents (Revenue) were unable to to prove

that a letter dated 04.04.79 was sent to the taxpayer with reasons for rejecting

the returns, and accordingly, the notice of assessment dated 30.03.1979 was sent

to the taxpayer without communicating reasons for not accepting the return in

total non-compliance with the provisions of section 93(2) and 93(C)(3) of the Inland

Revenue Act.

[77] In the present case, however, the letter of the assessor dated 26.11.2012

states Please treat that this letter is issued in terms of section 163 of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006. (See -letter of the assessor dated 26.11.2012 at p.

43 of the TAC file). There was no complaint whatsoever that the reasons for not

accepting the return were not communicated to the Appellant by the assessor

and the complaint was that it was received on 06.12.2012 (p. 49 of the TAC brief).

In fact, the letter dated 26.11.2012 with reasons for not accepting the return has

been sent to the Appellant before the notice of assessment dated 30.11.2012 was

sent to the Appellant. The Appellant admits that the notice of assessment dated

30.11.2012 was received on 18.12.2012. Accordingly, I am of the view that the

circumstances under which Victor Perera, J. made the above quoted statement

is not applicable to the facts of the present case.

[78] It is to be noted that the assessor and the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue appealed to the Supreme Court against the said order of the Court of

Appeal which issued a writ of certiorari quashing the assessment of tax (See-

D.M.S. Fernando and another v. A.M. Ismail Sri Lanka Tax Cases, Vol. IV, p. 184).

His Lordship the Chief Justice Samarakoon in D.M.S. Fernando and another v. A.M.

Ismail (supra) considered the duty imposed on an assessor under section 93 (2)

of Inland Revenue Act, No. 4 of 1963, as amended by the Inland Revenue

(Amendment) Acts, No. 17 of 1972 and 30 of 1978, in case the assessor rejects a

return.

[79] His Lordship the Chief Justice, having considered section 93(2) of the

amended Act, held that where the assessor rejects the return, he should state his

31

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

reasons and communicate them to the taxpayer at or about the time he sends his

assessment on an estimated income. His Lordship referring to section 115(3) of

the Inland Revenue Act, No. 4 of 1963 as amended by Act No. 17 of 1972 and Act,

No. 30 of 1978 in relation to the duty of the assessor in not accepting the return

held at p. 194:

Section 115(3) is an empowering section. It empowers the Assessor to do one of two things. He may accept the return, in which event he makes the assessment accordingly. Or else he may not accept the return. In such an event he is obliged to do two things:

1. Estimate the assessable income, taxable income or taxable gifts and

assess him accordingly (the underlining is mine); and

2. He must communicate to the Assessee in writing the reasons for not

accepting the return.

To my mind these are all part of one exercise. There is nothing in the

provision which indicates that the estimation of assessable income, wealth and gifts must be postponed for some time long after the non-acceptance. Even if one transposes the words and communicate to such persons in writing the reasons for not accepting the return to the first line of the section after the word return and before the word estimate it will not make it a condition precedent. One has still to read more words into it to have the effect of postponing the rest of the exercise to sometime later. This would be doing violence to the section. The section imposes a duty, but does not impose a time limit within which it should be done. To my mind the section merely states that if the Assessor does not accept a return, he may assess on an estimate. His exercise is not complete till he has also communicated his reasons for not accepting the return. In effect he also justifies his act of assessing on an estimate. The plain meaning of the section is clear. (Emphasis added)

[80] These words clearly imply that all what the assessor has to do, where he does

not accept the return, is (i) to estimate the assessable income,...; (ii) assess him

accordingly; and (iii) state reasons, and communicate such reasons to the

taxpayer in writing. The words of section 163(3) of the Inland Revenue Act are,

however, identical to section 93(2) and section 93(C)(3) of the repealed Inland

Revenue (Amendment) Acts, No. 17 of 1972 and and the Act, No. 30 of 1978. It

only imposes a duty on the assessor who made the assessment or additional

assessment to communicate the reasons to the taxpayer through a registered

post for not accepting the return.

32

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[81] The Appellants argument is that the making of assessment and serving the

notice of assessment are inseparable parts of the assessment which shall be made

simultaneously before the expiration of the period for the making of the

assessment relying on the part of the following statement made by Samarakoon

C.J. in D.M.S. Fernado v. A.M. Ismail (supra). It is apt to reproduce the entirety of

the statement made by Samarakoon C.J. in D.M.S. Fernado v. A.M. Ismail (supra)

at pp. 193-194:

A duty is now imposed on the Assessor not only to give reasons for non-acceptance of a return, but also to communicate them to the assessor. The primary purpose of the amending legislation is to ensure that the Assessor will bring his mind to bear on the return and come to a definite determination whether or not to accept it. It was intended to prevent arbitrary and grossly unfair assessments which many Assessors had been making as a protective measure. An unfortunate practice had developed where some Assessors, due to pressure of work and other reasons, tended to delay looking at a return till the last moment and then without a proper scrutiny of the return, made a grossly exaggerated assessment. The law, I think, enabled the department to make recoveries pending any appeal on such assessments. The overall effect of this unhappy practice was to pressurize the taxpayer to such an extent that he was placed virtually at the mercy of the tax authorities. The new law was a measure intended to do away with this practice. Under the amendment when an Assessor does not accept a return, it must mean that at the relevant point of time he has brought his mind to bear on the return and has come to a decision rejecting the return. Consequent to this rejection, the reasons must be communicated to the assessee. The provisions for the giving of reasons and the written communication of the reasons, contained in the amendment is to ensure that in fact the new procedure would be followed. More particularly, the communication of the reason at the relevant time is the indication of its compliance. The new procedure would also have the effect of fixing the Assessor to a definite position and not give him the latitude to chop and change thereafter. It was therefore essential that an Assessor who rejects a return should state his reasons and communicate them h. His reasons must be communicated at or about the time he sends his assessment on an estimated income. Any later communication would defeat the remedial action intended by the amendment (emphasis added). [82] The Appellants argument is that the substance of the statement made by Samarakoon C.J. is that a duty is now imposed on the Assessor who rejects the return and makes an assessment to state reasons for such rejection, communicate the same to the taxpayer, issue and serve the notice of assessment before the expiration of the period for the making of the assessment. In my view, all what His

33

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

Lordship Samarakoon CJ said in D.M.S. Fernando and another v. A.M. Ismail (supra) was that the assessor who rejected a return should state his reasons and communicate them at or about the time he sends his assessment on an estimated income to the taxpayer. I am afraid, there is nothing to indicate or gather from His Lordship Samarakoon C. Js statement that His Lordship has said that the notice of assessment shall also be sent to the taxpayer at or about the time he sends his assessment or that the notice of assessment shall be sent to the taxpayer before the expiration of three years for the making of the assessment.

[83] All what section 163(3) requires the assessor who rejects the return and made

the assessment or additional assessment is to communicate to the tax payer by

letter sent through the registered post, why he is not accepting the return, his

reasons for not accepting the return. Having made the assessment, the assessor

in the present case, by letter dated 26.11.2012 communicated to the taxpayer the

assessment and the reasons in writing for not accepting the return as required by

section 163(3). At the end of the letter, assessor states:

Please treat this letter as an intimation made under section 163(3) of the

Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006.

[84] It is manifest that the assessor could have communicated the reasons for not

accepting the return only after making the assessment, and therefore, the time bar

applies to the making of the assessment or additional assessment, and not to the

notice of assessment which is not dependent on the making of the assessment.

On the other hand, section 164 of the Inland Revenue Act imposes a duty on the

assessor who made the assessment to send a notice in writing requiring the person

who was assessed stating the amount of income assessed and the amount of tax

charged. Section 163 also imposes a duty on the assessor who assessed any person

who failed to furnish a return, by notice in writing requiring him to pay on or before

a date the amount specified in that notice, the amount of the tax so assessed, if

such person has not paid any tax, or the difference between the amount of tax so

assessed and the amount of the tax paid by such person. Furthermore, section 163

(2) imposes a duty on the assessor who made an additional assessment to serve

the notice of assessment on the taxpayer. Both sections do not specify a time limit

within which the notice of assessment shall be served on the assessor.

[85] The Appellant argued that the date on which the notice of assessment dated 30.11.2012 was served on the taxpayer should be regarded as the date for the making of the assessment, completely ignoring the letter of communication dated 26.11.2012 issued by the assessor to the Appellant in terms of section 163(3) of

34

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

the Inland Revenue Act. It contains an assessment and reasons for not accepting the returns. It is obvious that the communication of the reasons for not accepting of the return cannot be issued unless the assessor had in fact made the assessment by 26.11.2012 under section 163(3) or an additional assessment under section 163(2). [86] One cannot fathom from the language of section 163 (3) that the notice of

assessment should also be sent together with the communication of the reasons

for non-acceptance of the return. Once the assessment or additional assessment

had been made, the assessor is fixed to a definite assessment, a position which

cannot be changed thereafter. Accordingly, what is communicated to the taxpayer

under section 163(3) is the definite assessment made by the assessor with reasons

signed by the assessor. In the circumstance, the communication of such

assessment or additional assessment with reasons is the clear proof that the

assessment had been made on a definite position, and therefore, the notice of

assessment, under section 164 will only be sent to the taxpayer who has been

assessed under section 163(3). In the absence of any statutory obligation imposed

on the assessor, I am not inclined to accept the argument that the notice of

assessment shall also be sent to the taxpayer under section 163(3) before the time

bar period expires to make the assessment.

[87] In order to buttress the argument that though the making of assessment and

sending of notice of assessment are two different things, a valid assessment

cannot be made in time unless notice of assessment is served on the taxpayer

prior to the expiry of the statutory time bar for making an assessment, the

Appellant relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in ACL Cables v. CGIR

(supra) and John keels Holdings v. CGIR (supra). The issue in both cases (ACL

Cables v. CGIR and John keels Holdings v. CGIR (supra) was whether the

assessment in question was made within the meaning of section 163(3) of the

Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006. The argument in both cases, related to the

question whether the effective date for the commencement of the time bar is the

date of making the assessment or the date of sending the notice of assessment to

the taxpayer.

[88] Having considered the views expressed by Perera J. In A. M. Ismail v.

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra) and the views expressed by His

Lordship Samarakoon C.J in D. M. S. Fernando v. A. M. Ismail, (supra), Samarakoon

J., in ACL Cables PLC v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra) held that

the making of the assessment is same as giving of assessment and therefore,

35

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

no lawfully valid assessment can be made without first serving a notice of

assessment. Samarakoon J., stated at pp. 24-25 as follows:

Therefore, both Justice Victor Perera and the learned Chief Justice have based their judgments in the premise that making the assessment is same as giving notice of assessment. This was why it had been argued in CA Tax 17/2017 that no lawfully valid assessment can be made without first serving a valid notice of assessment. The Division of this Court in C.A. Tax 17/2017 though that this is a practical impossibility. A letter cannot be sent without being written. But what was meant is not this. The argument of the appellant is that an assessment becomes valid only when the notice is given. This position was the basis of Ismail despite those two cases were concurred with the duty to give reasons. The position of the appellant is that an assessment is no assessment until notice of assessment is given. The position could have been otherwise, viz. an assessment could have been a valid assessment, as soon as an estimate is made. If like in Honig (administrators of Emmanuel Honig) v Sarasfield (H.M. Inspector of Taxes), the Commissioners Inland Revenue also maintained a register in which an assessment is entered. In the absence of such procedure in this country. It cannot be accepted that the making of an assessment without giving notice of assessment is a valid assessment. Hence, notice of assessment must be given to make the assessment validly made for the purpose of the stipulated time period.

[89] The Court in ACL Cables PLC v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra) further stated that there cannot be a valid assessment made without there being a notice of assessment at pp 30-31 as follows:

The lucidity in the aforequoted passage is characteristic of the age in which it was written. The taxpayer could have instituted a suit and recovered the tax paid because there was no assessment. There was no assessment because there is no notice, a demand, a charge within the limited period. This shows that assessment becomes a valid assessment only when notice of assessment is given. For the application of the time limit, what must be there is a valid assessment. Such an assessment cannot come into being without there being notice of assessment [Emphasis added].

[90] In John Keels Holdings PLC v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

(supra) Samarakoon J. held that the time bar commences with the sending of the

notice of assessment, and not with the making of the assessment unless a book

or a register is maintained to indicate the evidence of the date of the making of

the assessment and therefore, the sending of the notice of assessment has to be

done within the time bar period. His Lordship stated at p. 32:

36

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

Hence, the argument of the Tax Appeals Commission in the present case that the effective date for the commencement of the time bar is the date of making the assessment not the date of sending the notice could have been accepted if there was a book or a register maintained by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue which will be evidence of the date of making of assessment.

[91] His Lordship Samarakoon J., further took the view that section 163(1) is subject to the provisions of subsection (3) and (5) and section 163(5) is also subject to time limits. Hence, sending of notice must be made within the prescribed time. His Lordship stated at page 30 as follows:

But section 163(1) refers to asses the amount...and shall by notice in writing require such person to pay forthwith. ....Section 163(1) also says subject to the provisions of subsection (3) and (5). It is section 165(5) which has the time limit. Hence, sending of notice must be made within the prescribed time.

[92] In both cases, Samarakoon, J. held that no valid assessment can be made until

notice of assessment is sent to the taxpayer, or no lawfully valid assessment can

be made without first serving a notice of assessment on the taxpayer unless the

assessor could have maintained a book or register in which an assessment is

entered. Accordingly, Samarakoon J. held that in the absence of such a practice in

Sri Lanka, making of an assessment without giving notice of assessment within the

time bar period is not valid.

[93] The question that arose in Ismail v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra)

and in D.M.S. Fernando and another v. Ismail (supra) was whether the duty is

imposed on the Assessor who rejects a return in terms of section 93(5) of the

Inland Revenue Act No. 4 of 1963 (as amended) to state reasons, and if so, whether

the communication of reasons in writing is mandatory and requires compliance.

The question of whether the time bar applies to the making of the assessment or

the notice of assessment was considered in Stafford Motor Company (Pvt) Limited

v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CA Tax 17 of 2017 decided on

15.03.2019). Janak de Silva J., stated in Stafford Motor Company (Pvt) Limited v.

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra) that the question of whether

the time bar applies to the making of assessment or the notice of assessment did

no arise for determination either in the Court of Appeal case, or in the Supreme

Court case, and therefore, there is no binding precedent established in the said

two cases on the said issue (Vide-page 9 of the judgment).

[94] It is relevant to note that the Court of Appeal in Cables v. CGIR (supra) and

John keels Holdings v CGIR (supra) refused to follow the decision of the Court of

Appeal in Commissioner General Tax v. Chettinand Corporation 55 NLR 556, Honig

37

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

& Others (Administrator of Emmanuel (Honig) v. Sarsfield (H. M. Inspector of

Taxes) Ch. Div. (1985) STRC 31 (CA) / (CA) (1986 STC 246 and Stafford Motors v.

CGIR (supra). The decisions in all these cases were based on the well established

proposition that the making of the assessment and serving of notice of assessment

are two different acts.

[95]In Honig & Others (Administrators of Emmanuel (Honig) v. Sarsfield (H. M.

Inspector of Taxes) (supra), some weeks before the time limit in section 40 of the

Taxes Management Act, 1970, the Inspector of Taxes on 16.03.1970 raised

assessments against the administrators of Emanuel Honig by signing certificates

to that effect where he entered into the assessment book stating that he had made

assessments on the administrators. The notices of assessment were issued on

16.03.1970 but did not reach the administrators until after 07.04.1970. The time

bar for the making of the assessment was 06.04.1970 under sections 34(1) and 40

of the Taxes Management Act, 1970.

[96] The Special Commissioners held that (i) the assessments were made on

16.03.1970 when the duly authorised Inspector signed the certificate and that they

were not out of time. The Chancery Division, dismissing the appeal held that the

making of an assessment was not dependent on the service of the notice of

assessment, as the assessment was made on 16.03.1970 and so, it was within the

time limit prescribed by section 34 and 40(1) of the Act. The Court of Appeal in

dismissing the appeal held that the assessments were made on 16.03.1970 when

the Inspector of Taxes signed the certificate in the assessment book. The

fundamental question that arose for decision before the Court of Appeal was this:

Is an assessment effectively made until notice of it has been given to the taxpayer?

Section 29(1) of the Act provided as follows: Except as otherwise provided, all

assessments for tax shall be made by the Inspector. Section 29(5) provided that

notice of any assessment of tax shall be served on the person assessed, and shall

state the time within which any appeal against the assessment may be made.

Section 29(6) provided that After the notice of assessment has been served on

the person assessed, the assessment shall not be altered except in accordance

with the express provisions of the Taxes Acts..

[97] The Court of Appeal in Honig answered the question whether an assessment effectively made until notice of it has been given to the taxpayer and held at paragraph F:

It seems to me that the words in s. 29(5) notice of any assessment to tax...

necessarily imply that there is a difference between the notice of assessment

38

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

and the assessment. One cannot have a notice of an assessment until there has been an actual and valid assessment. In subs (6) one finds the words After the notice of assessment has been served on the person assessed..... The reference there to the person assessed implies to my mind that there has been an assessment. It is clear that that subsection contemplates that an assessment is different from and will be followed by the notice of assessment and that its validity in no way depends on the latter. They are two wholly different things. .......

That section again draws a clear distinction between the assessment and the notice of assessment and shows that they are different, the assessment being in no way dependent upon the service of the notice [emphasis added].

[98] The ratio of the decision was that the assessment is different from the notice

of assessment, and it is in no way dependent on the service of the notice of

assessment. When the Inspector of Taxes signed a certificate in the assessment

book stating that he had made an assessment, is good evidence that an

assessment had been made under the Taxes Management Act. The reason is

obvious. It has the effect of fixing the Inspector of Taxes to a definite position,

and not give him the latitude to chop and change thereafter, echoing the quoted

words used by Samarakoon C.J. in D.M.S. Fernando v A.M. Ismail (p. 194). But, the

fact that the assessment is made when the certificate recording its entry in the

assessment book is signed by the Inspector of Taxes cannot be taken into account

in displacing the distinction between the making of the assessment and the

sending of the notice of assessment under the Inland Revenue Act.

[99] The Inland Revenue Act of Sri Lanka goes a step forward and imposes a

mandatory statutory obligation on the assessor who made the assessment to

communicate his reasons in writing to the taxpayer why his return was not

accepted. The assessor who makes the assessment in Sri Lanka need not produce

any assessment register to establish that an assessment was made when he

communicated the assessment, with his reasons in writing to the taxpayer under

his signature, why he is not accepting the return.

[100] In England, the certificate made by the Inspector of Taxes in the assessment

book may fix the Inspector of Taxes to a definite position that an assessment has

been made under the provisions of the Taxes Management Act. In Sri Lanka, once

the assessment made by the assessor is communicated to the taxpayer in writing

(by registered letter dated 09.09.2013) signed by the assessor with reasons for not

accepting the return, the assessor is fixed to a definite position that an assessment

had been made, which cannot be changed or chopped thereafter. When that

39

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

happens, there is no way for the taxpayer to argue that no assessment has been

made until the notice of assessment is received.

[101] The fact that the Inspector of Taxes signed the certificate in the assessment

book stating that an assessment was made under the Taxes Management Act,

cannot be applied in displacing its ratio of Honig that the making of the

assessment was not dependent on the service of the notice of assessment, which

are two different things. Accordingly, it is not possible to distinguish the decision

in Honig from the present case and accept the Appellants argument that unless

the notice of assessment is served, there is no valid assessment.

[102] The Appellant argued that unless the notice of assessment is served on the

assessee within the period for the making of the assessment, the assessor could

indefinitely delay the sending of the notice of assessment, and issue the same at

any time as he wishes. If that is the intention of Parliament, the legislature should

have specifically stated so in the Inland Revenue Act that the letter of

communication as required by section 163(3) of the Inland Revenue Act shall be

accompanied by the notice of assessment or that the notice of assessment shall

be served within the period for the making of the assessment. In this context, the

question whether the notice of assessment should also be sent before the

expiration of the time period for the making of the assessment is the exclusive

province of the Parliament.

[103] It is settled law that courts cannot usurp legislative function under the

disguise of interpretation and rewrite, recast, reframe and redesign the Inland

Revenue Act, because this is exclusively in the domain of the legislature. This

proposition was lucidly explained by Lord Simonds in Magor and St Mellons Rural

District Council v. Newport Corporation [1952] AC 189, HL. Referring to the speech

of Lord Denning MR, Lord Simonds said at page 191:

The duty of the court is to interpret the words that the legislature has used; those words may be ambiguous, but, even if they are, the power and the duty of the court to travel outside them on a voyage of discovery are strictly limited..

[104] MR, Lord Simonds further said at page 192:

It appears to me to be a naked usurpation of the legislative function under the thin disguise of interpretation and it is the less justifiable when it is guesswork with what material the legislature would, if it had discovered the gap, have filled it in. If a gap is disclosed, the remedy lies in an amending Act.

40

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[105] The same proposition was echoed by Arijit Pasayat, J. in the Indian Supreme

Court case of Padmasundara Rao and Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors. AIR

(2002) SC 1334, at paragraph 14 as follows:

14. While interpreting a provision the Court only interprets the law and cannot legislate it. If a provision of law is misused and subjected to the abuse of process of law, it is for the legislature to amend, modify or repeal it, if deemed necessary.

[106] In Commissioner of Income Tax v. Chettinand Corporation 55 NLR 553, the

Court considered the distinction between the assessment and the notice of

assessment under the provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance No. 2 of 1932 (as

amended).Gratien J., at 556 stated:

The distinction' between an assessment and a notice of assessment is thus made clear: the former is the departmental computation of the amount of tax with which a particular assessee is considered to be chargeable, and the latter is the formal intimation to him of the fact that such an assessment has been made.

[107]. In Stafford Motors Company (Pvt) Ltd v Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (supra), the Court of Appeal considered the question whether (i) the

serving a notice of assessment is a necessary precondition that must be satisfied

to confer validity on the assessment; and (ii) the notice of assessment must be

served on the taxpayer prior to the expiry of the time bar. Janak de Silva J. stated

at page 8:

Sections 163(1) and (2) of the 2006 Act provide for making of assessments of

Sections any person while section 164 therein requires a notice of assessment to be given to a person who has been so assessed. Therefore, Court rejects the submission made by the learned counsel for the Appellant that no lawfully valid assessment can be made without first serving a valid notice of assessment. There is no requirement to give notice of assessment before making an assessment. Practically, it cannot be done as the assessment must first be made followed by a notice of assessment.

The time bar to making of an assessment is set out in section 163(5) of the

2006 Act. The section clearly states that no assessment shall be made after the time specified therein. Given that the 2006 Act recognizes a distinction between an assessment and a notice of assessment , it would have been convenient for the legislature to refer to the notice of Assessment rather than assessment in section 163(5) of the 2006 Act. On the contrary, it has been made effective for the making of an assessment. Therefore, Court rejects the submission that the date of the posting of the notice of

41

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

assessment is the relevant date for the purpose of determining the time bar for making an assessment. Court determines that the date of making the assessment is the relevant date for the purpose of determining the time bar.

[108] In Illukkumbura Industrial Automation (Private) Limited v Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue CA Tax 5/2016) decided on 29.09.2022, the issue before

the Court of Appeal was, inter alia, whether the intimation letter dated 28.11.2011

issued by the assessor with reasons for not accepting the return under section

163(3) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 can be treated as evidence of

making an assessment, or whether no valid assessment can be made until after

the notice of assessment is issued to the assessee. Rejecting the argument of the

Appellant that no valid assessment can be made until after the notice of

assessment is issued to the assessee, Wijeratne J., stated at page 16:

The letter of intimation dated 28.11.2011 contains an assessment on an

estimated income and, therefore, the letter of intimation satisfies both the requirements, the reasons for rejecting the return and the assessment on an estimated income. Hence, the assessment had been made before, or at least on the 28th November 2011.

[109] The words in section 163 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act state Assesor,

Assistant Commissioner may, subject to the provisions of subsection (3), and (5),

.assess the amount which in the judgment of the Assessor, Assistant

Commissioner... The words in sections 163(3) state the Assessor of Assistant

Commissioner makes an assessment or additional assessment Those words

necessarily imply that first, there has to be an assessment made by the assessor

and such assessment shall be communicated to the taxpayer in writing with

reasons for not accepting the return.

[110] On the other hand, the words in section 164, An Assessor or Assistant

Commissioner shall give notice of assessment to each person . stating the amount

of income assessed and the amount of tax charged... necessarily imply that after

making the assessment, the notice of assessment in writing has to be served on

such person assessed. There cannot have a notice of assessment until there has

been an actual and valid assessment made by the assessor. It is that assessment

that has to be communicated to the taxpayer in writing with reasons as required

by section 163(3). Upon making the assessment, the notice of assessment must

be given to the taxpayer as required by section 164 demanding to pay the amount

of income assessed under section 163(3) and the amount of tax charged.

[111] If it was the intention of the legislature that the relevant date for the validity

of the assessment is the date of posting of the notice of assessment, the legislature

42

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

could have referred to the notice of assessment in section 163(3) rather than the

assessment. Section 163 (3). In my view, section 163(3) and section 164 of the

Inland Revenue Act Act clearly recognises the distinction between the

assessment and the notice of assessment..

[112] It is crystal clear that the Inland Revenue Act contemplates a distinction

between the making of the assessment and the serving of the notice of assessment

and the validity of the assessment in no way depends on the notice of assessment.

It is the making of an assessment that has to be considered to determine the

question of time bar under section 163(5) and not the serving of the notice of

assessment. I am inclined to follow the decisions in Honig & Others

(Administrators of Emmanuel (Honig) v. Sarsfield (H. M. Inspector of Taxes) (supra),

Commissioner of Income Tax v. Chettinand Corporation (supra), Stafford Motors

Company (Pvt) Ltd v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra),

Illukkumbura Industrial Automation (Private) Limited v. Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue (supra) and Unilever Sri Lanka Limited, v Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue, (supra).

[113] For those reasons, I hold that the time bar of the assessment in section 163

(5) of the Inland Revenue Act applies to the making of the assessment and not to

the serving of the notice of assessment, and the serving a notice of assessment is

not a precondition for the validity of the assessment. In the present case, it is

absolutely clear that the assessor who rejected the return estimated the amount

of the assessable income of the taxpayer, and made the assessment accordingly

and thereafter, the reasons for non accepting the return were communicated to

the taxpayer by the same letter.

[114] I reject the contention of the Appellant that a valid assessment can only be

made if the notice of assessment is served on the taxpayer and the letter dated

26.11.2012 is only a source document which is referred to in the notice of

assessment. In the present case, the letter of intimation dated 26.11.2012 which

contains the proof of assessment made by the assessor, and the reasons in detail

for not accepting the returns. The assessor has communicated reasons for not

accepting the return as required by section 163(3) of the Inland Revenue Act. In

the circumstance, the assessments shall be deemed to have been made by the

assessor on or before 26.11.2012, and such date shall be regarded as the relevant

date to determine the time bar of the assessment under section 163(5).

Whether the assessment is nevertheless time barred in terms of section 163(5) of

the Inland Revenue Act

43

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[115] The next crucial question is to consider, even if the assessment was made on

26.11.2012, whether the assessment should have been made on or before

31.03.2012 and if so, whether the assessment made on 26.11.2012 is nevertheless

time barred under section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act (as amended).

[116] During the course of the further argument on the applicability of the

judgment of the Supreme Court in Seylan Bank PLC v. Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue SC Appeal No. 46/2016 decided on 16.12.2021, Dr. Felix submitted

that even if the assessment was made on 26.11.2012, as submitted by the

Respondent, the applicable law for the year of assessment 2009/2010 commenced

on 01.04.2010 and ended on 31.03.2010 and thus, the statutory amendment

applied in respect of the said year of assessment was the Inland Revenue

(Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009, which applied to any year of assessment on or

after 1, April 2009. He further submitted that section 27 of the Inland Revenue

(Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009, which changed the time bar relating to

assessment, but it did not provide that the amendment made to section 163(5) of

the principal enactment had retrospective effect. Dr. Felix strenuously argued that

the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act. No. 22 of 2011 came into effect on

01.04.2011, which further changed the time bar relating to assessment, but it

applied to any year of assessment on or after 01.04.2011 and the amendment

made to section 163(5) of the principal enactment by the Act, No. 22 of 2011 had

no retrospective effect in terms of section 56 of the said Act, No. 22 of 2011.

[117] He further submitted that the said amendment was prospective in nature,

which has no effect on any year of assessment prior to 1, April 2011 and section

56 of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011 did not provide that

the amendment made to section 163(5) of the principal enactment had

retrospective effect. He submitted that even if the assessment was made on

26.11.2012, it was time barred within 2 years from the end of the relevant year of

assessment 2009/2010 (i.e., by 31.03.2012) in terms of section 163(5) of the Inland

Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 10 of 2009. He relied on the decision of the

Supreme Court in Seylan Bank PLC v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

(supra) in support of his contention.

[118] On the other hand, Mr. Wigneswaran submitted that (i) the Inland Revenue

Act, No. 10 of 2006 provided that no assessment shall be made after the expiry of

18 months from the end of the immediately succeeding year of assessment (i.e.

until 30th September of the following year; (ii) this section was amended by the

Act No. 19 of 2009 which provided that no assessment shall be made after the

44

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

expiry of a period of 2 years from the end of the immediately succeeding year of

assessment (i.e. until 31st March of the second year following the year of

assessment); (iii) a further amendment was made by the Act. No. 22 of 2011, which

came into operation on 01.04.2011, which provided that no assessment shall be

made after the expiry of a period of 2 years from the 30th day of November of the

immediately succeeding year of assessment (i.e. until 30th November of the second

year following the year of assessment); (iv) the return was submitted on 20.08.2010

and the Inland Revenue Act was amended by the Act, No. 22 of 2011 and thus, the

legal regime applicable to the said return required the assessment to be made on

or before 30th November 2012; (v) the assessment was made on 26.11.2012 and

accordingly, the assessment is within the time stipulated in the Inland Revenue

(Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011. He submitted that the decision of the Supreme

Court in Seylan Bank PLC v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra) is

inapplicable to the present case.

[119] In view of the rival submissions of the parties, the following questions arise

for determination:

1. If the assessment was made on 26.11.2012, whether the Inland Revenue

(Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009 applied to the year of assessment

2009/2010;

2. If the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009 applied to the year

of assessment 2009/2010, whether the assessment should have been made

on or before 31.03.2012 and if so, whether the assessment that was made on

26.11.2012 is time barred;

3. If the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011 applied to the year

of assessment 2009/2010, with retrospective effect, whether the period given

to the assessor to make the assessment for the year of assessment 2009/2010

had been extended from 31.03.2012 to 30.11.2012, in terms of the Inland

Revenue (Amendment) Act, 22 of 2011.

4. If so, whether the assessor was entitled to make the assessment during the

extended period given to the assessor to make the assessment on or before

30.11.2012, and if so, whether the assessment made on 26.11.2012 is not time

barred in terms of the Inland Revenue Act, (as amended).

45

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 before the amendment by Act, No. 19 of 2009

[120] At this stage, it may be pertinent to consider the relevant provisions of the

Inland Revenue Act in relation to the period within which the assessment shall

be made by the assessor. Under section 106 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10

of 2006, the assesee had to submit his return on or before the 30th of September

of that assessment year. The Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 in its original

form reads as follows:

106. (1) Every person who is chargeable with income tax under this Act for any year of assessment shall, on or before the thirtieth day of September immediately succeeding the end of that year of assessment, furnish to an Assessor, either in writing or by electronic means, a return in such from and containing such particulars as may be specified by the Commissioner-General, of his income, and if he has a child, the income of such child.

Amendment to section 106 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 by the

Inland Revenue Act, No. 19 of 2009

[121] Section 106 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 was amended by

the Inland Revenue Amendment Act No. 19 of 2009, which extended the time

period given to the assessee to furnish a return from the 30th day of September

to the 30th day of November immediately succeeding the end of that year of

assessment. The Amended section 106 (1) of the The Inland Revenue

Amendment Act No. 10 of 2009 reads as follows:

Every person who is chargeable with income tax under this Act for any year of assessment shall, on or before the thirtieth day of November immediately succeeding the end of that year of assessment, furnish to an Assessor or Assistant Commissioner, either in writing or by electronic means, a return in such form and containing such particulars as may be specified by the Commissioner-General, of his income, and if he has a child, the income of such child:

Provided however, the preceding provisions shall not apply to an individual whose income for any year of assessment comprises solely of one or a combination of the following:

(a) Profits from employment as specified in section 4 and chargeable with

income tax does not exceed rupees four hundred and twenty thousand, and income tax under Chapter XIV has been deducted by the employer on the gross amount of such profit and income;

46

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

(b) Dividends chargeable with tax on which tax at ten per centum has been

deducted under subsection (1) of section 65; (c) Income tax from interest chargeable with tax on which tax at the rate of

ten per centum has been deducted under section 133,

Time bar for Making the Assessment before the Amendments made to the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006

[122] Section 163 (5) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006, which deals

with the time bar relating to assessments, provided as follows:

(5) Subject to the provisions of section 72, no assessment of the income tax payable under this Act by any person or partnership-

(a) who or which has made a return of his or its income on or before the

thirtieth day of September of the year of assessment immediately succeeding that year of assessment, shall be made after the expiry of eighteen months from the end of that year of assessment; and

(b) who has failed to make a return on or before such date as referred to in

paragraph (a), shall be made after the expiry of a period of three years from the end of that year of assessment:.

Provided, that nothing in this subsection shall apply to the assessment of income tax payable by any person in respect of any year of assessment, consequent to the receipt by such person of any arrears relating to the profits from employment of that person for that year of assessment:

Provided further that, where in the opinion of the Assessor, any fraud, evasion or wilful default has been committed by or on behalf of, any person in relation to any income tax payable by such person for any year of assessment, it shall be lawful for the Assessor to make an assessment or an additional assessment on such person at any time after the end of that year of assessment.

[123] Accordingly, the original Inland Revenue Act enacted that no assessment

shall be made after the expiry of eighteen months from the end of the

immediately succeeding year of assessment (i.e. until 30th September of the

following year.

47

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

Time bar for making the assessment after the amendments made to section

163(5) by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009

[124] Section 163 (5) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 was amended

by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009, which changed the

time bar relating to assessment, and enacted as follows:

(5) Subject to the provisions of section 72, no assessment of the income tax payable under this Act by any person or partnership-

(a) who or which has made a return of his or its income on or before the

thirtieth day of November of the year of assessment immediately succeeding that year of assessment, shall be made after the expiry of a period of two years, from the end of that year of assessment; and

(b) who has failed to make a return on or before such date as referred to

in paragraph (a), shall be made after the expiry of a period of four years. from the end of that year of assessment:.

Provided, that nothing in this subsection shall apply to the assessment of income tax payable by any person in respect of any year of assessment, consequent to the receipt by such person of any arrears relating to the profits from employment of that person for that year of assessment:

Provided further that, where in the opinion of the Assessor, any fraud, evasion or wilful default has been committed by or on behalf of, any person in relation to any income tax payable by such person for any year of assessment, it shall be lawful for the Assessor to make an assessment or an additional assessment on such person at any time after the end of that year of assessment.

[125] The Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009 extended both the

time periods given to a taxpayer to submit a return of his income for a given

year of assessment by two months, and the assessor to make an assessment for

such year of assessment by six months respectively. The Inland Revenue

(Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009 however, provided that no assessment shall

be made after the expiry of a period of 2 years from the end of the immediately

succeeding year of assessment (i.e. until 31st March of the second year following

the year of assessment).

48

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[126] In the present case, the assessment related to the year of assessment

2009/2010, which commenced on 01.04.2009 and ended on 31.03.2010. In the

present case, the assessment related to the year of assessment 2009/2010,

which commenced on 01.04.2009 and ended on 31.03.2010. It is relevant to

note that income tax is charged for every year of assessment commencing on

or April 1, in respect of the profits and income of every person for that year of

assessment (see- section 2(1) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006). The

return is filed by the taxpayer for every year of assessment and the assessment

is made by the assessor for that relevant year of assessment (see- section 106(1)

section 163(1) and section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act). In terms of section

217 of the Inland Revenue Act (as amended), year of assessment means the

period of twelve months commencing on the first day of April of any year and

ending on the thirty-first day of March of any year and ending on the thirty-first

day of March in the immediately succedding year.

[127] The Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009 came into effect on

01.04.2009 and prima facie, the law for the year of assessment 2009/2010 is the

Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009. The assessee was required

to file its return in terms of the extended period granted to file the return by

the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009 on or before 30.11.2010

and the assessee filed its return on 20.08.2010. The assessor was required to

make the assessment on or before 31.03.2012 for the year of assessment

2009/2010 under the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009. In

terms of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009, the assessment

will be, prima facie, time barred within a period of 2 years from the end of the

relevant year of assessment (2009/2010), which means by 31.03.2012.. The

assessment was made on 26.11.2012. The time bar that will be triggered in the

year of assessment 2009/2010 under the Inland Revenue Act, No. 19 of 2009 is

as follows:

Year of assessment - 2009-2010

Return to be filed for the year of assessment 2010/2011 - 20.08.2010

End of the year for 2009/2010 - 31.03.2011

Assessment must be made on or before - 31.03.2012

Assessment was made on - 26.11.2012

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

Time bar for making the assessment after the amendments made to section

163(5) by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011

[128] After the taxpayer filed return of income on 20.08.2010, and while the said

time period given to the assessor to make his assessment for the year of

assessment 2009/2010 under the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of

2009 was in operation,the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011

was enacted by Parliament. The said amendment was certified by the Speaker

on 31.03.2011. By that time, the assessee had already filed its return on

20.08.2010.

[129] By the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011, section 163(5)

of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 was further amended by extending

the time period given to the assessor to make his assessment for the year of

assessment from March 31st March to 30th November immediately succeeding

that year of assessment. The Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011

thus, provided that where a return is made on or before 30th November of the

year of assessment immediately succeeding that year of assessment, no

assessment shall be made after the expiry of a period of 2 years from the 30th

of November of the immediately succeeding year of assessment (i.e. 30th

November). In terms of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009,

the assessor was required to make the assessment for the year of assessment

2009/2010 on or before 31.03.2012 but the assessor made the assessment for

the year of assessment 2009/2010 on 26.11.2012 on the basis that the amending

Act (Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011) extended the time

period given to the assessor to make the assessment for the year of assessment

2009/2010 from 31.03.2012 to 30.11.2012.

[130] The question before us is to decide whether the assessment issued for the

year of assessment 2009/2010 on 26.11.2012, was time barred for the failure to

make the assessment on or before 31.03.2012 under the Inland Revenue

(Amendment) act, No. 19 of 2009, or whether the amending Act (Inland

Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011) extended the time period from

31.03.2012 to 30.11.2012 with retrospective effect to make the assessment for

the year of assessment 2009/2010

Whether the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011 has retrospective

operation

50

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[131] Section 80(1) of the Constitution provides that a Bill passed by Parliament

shall become law when the certificate of the Speaker is endorsed thereon and

thus, by operation of Article 80(1) of the Constotution, it should have come into

force from that date as the Speaker certified the Bill on 31.03.2009. However,

section 27(6) of the Act, No. 19 of 2009 provides that the amendments made

to the principal enactment by the Act, No. 19 of 2009, other than the

amendments specifically referred to in subsections (1)-(5) of section 27 shall

come into force on April 1, 2009. The amendment made to section 163(5) of the

principal enactment is not a section that is specifically referred to in subsections

(1)-(5) of section 27. Accordingly, the amendment made to section 163(5) of the

principal enactment came into force on 01.04.2009. Section 75 of the

Constitution confers power on the legislature to make laws, including laws

having retrospective effect and repealing or amending any provision of the

Constitution, or adding any provision to the Constitution.

Retrospective and prospective amendments

[132] It is relevant to note that a substantive law defines and provides for rights, duties and liabilities whereas the procedural law deals with the application of substantive law to particular cases (Izhar Ahmed Khan v. Union of India AIR 1962 1052) (e.g. law of evidence or practice of courts or limitation).

General Rule- Presumption against retrospective construction- prospective effect

[133] There is a presumption of retrospective construction and a presumption against retrospective construction. The cardinal principle of construction is that every statute is prima facie, prospective unless it is expressly or by necessary implication made to have a retrospective operation (Keshvan v. State of Bombay AIR 1951 SC). The general rule is that all statutes other than those which are merely declaratory or which relate only to matters of procedure or of evidence are prima facie prospective (TAXMANNS Interpretation of Statutes, p. 860). The retrospective operation should not be given to a statute unless by express words or necessary implication, it appears that this was the intention of the legislature. (Supra, p. 840, 846).

[134] The general rule or presumption against retrospective operation of

statutes applies where it deals with substantive rights, or existing rights or

obligations or where the object of the statute is to affect vested rights or to

impose new burdens or impair existing obligations (Justice G P Singh, Principles

of Statutory Interpretation, 12th Ed, p. 524). Retrospective effect should not be

51

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

given to them unless, by express words or necessary implication, it appears that

this was the intention of the legislature (ITO v T.S. Devinatha Nadar (1938) 68

ITR 252 (SC). Unless there are words in the statute sufficient to show the

intention of the legislature to affect existing rights, it is deemed to be

prospective only (Justice G P Singh, Principles of Statutory Interpretation, 12th

ed, p. 524). If the enactment is expressed in the language which is fairly capable

of either interpretation, it is ought to be construed as prospective only (In re

Athlumney (1898 2 QB 547):

[135] The real issue is to look at the scope of the particular enactment having regard to its language and the object discernible from the statute read as a whole. It is necessary to keep in mind that in order to decide whether an Act is retrospective or prospective, to consider the legislative intention in making the provisions of an Act, retrospective or prospective. The courts will consider the following two principles:

1. If is necessary implication from the language employed that the legislature

intended a particular section to have a retrospective operation, the courts will give it such an operation because it is obviously competent for the legislature if it pleases in its wisdom to make the provisions of an Act retrospective;

2. If, on the other hand, the language employed by the legislature is

ambiguous or not clear and explicit, the court must not give a construction which would take away vested rights, or in other words, should treat the Act as prospective (TAXMANNS TAXMANNS Interpretation of Statutes, p. 846).).

The presumption of retrospective operation-retrospective effect

[136] The presumption against retrospective construction applies only in

respect of substantive law and not against the procedural law but the

presumption of retrospective operation applies when the statute deals with the

procedure or practice of the courts. In Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes,

12th Edn., the statement of law in this regard is stated thus:

"Perhaps no rule of construction is more firmly established than thus - that a retrospective operation is not to be given to a statute so as to impair an existing right or obligation, otherwise than as regards matters of procedure, unless that effect cannot be avoided without doing violence to the language of the enactment. If the enactment is expressed in language which is fairly capable of either interpretation, it ought to be construed as

52

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

prospective only.' The rule has, in fact, two aspects, for it, "involves another and subordinate rule, to the effect that a statute is not to be construed so as to have a greater retrospective operation than its language renders necessary."

[137] If the new Act affects only matters of procedure, prima facie, it applies to all actions-pending, as well as future. The principle applies to-(a) the forms of procedure; (b) the admissibility of evidence; and (c) the effect which the courts give to evidence of a particular category (Blyth v. Blyth (No. 2) (1966) AC 643). Accordingly, the alterations in the form of procedure are always retrospective, unless there are some good reasons or otherwise, they should not be such as it is expressly stated so. (TAXMANNS Interpretation of Statutes, supra). If the law deals with matters of procedure only, it is deemed to be retrospective unless such inference is likely to lead to unjust results (supra).

[138] In Francis Bennion's Statutory Interpretation, 2nd Edn, the statement of the law is stated as follows:

.The true principle is that lex prospicit non respicit (law looks forward not back). As Willes, J. said retrospective legislation is 'contrary to the general principle that legislation by which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated ought, when introduced for the first time, to deal with future acts, and ought not to change the character of past transactions carried on upon the faith of the then existing law."

[139] In Hitendra Vishnu Thakur v. State Of Maharashtra 994 AIR 2623, 1994 SCC (4) 602, DR ANAND, J. of the Supreme Court of India held:

26From the law settled by this Court in various cases, the illustrative though not exhaustive principles which emerge with regard to the ambit and scope of an Amending Act and its retrospective operation may be culled out as follows:

(i) A statute which affects substantive rights is presumed to be prospective in operation unless made retrospective, either expressly or by necessary intendment, whereas a statute which merely affects procedure, unless such a construction is textually impossible, is presumed to be retrospective in its application, should not be given an extended meaning and should be strictly confined to its clearly defined limits. (ii) Law relating to forum and limitation is procedural in nature, whereas law relating to right of action and right of appeal even though remedial is substantive in nature.

53

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

(iii) Every litigant has a vested right in substantive law, but no such right exists in procedural law. (iv) A procedural statute should not generally speaking be applied retrospectively where the result would be to create new disabilities or obligations or to impose new duties in respect of transactions already accomplished. (v) A statute which not only changes the procedure but also creates new rights and liabilities shall be construed to be prospective in operation, unless otherwise provided, either expressly or by necessary implication". Retrospectivity and Prospectivity in Amending Acts

[140] It is relevant to note that where a repeal of statutory provision dealing

with substantive rights is followed by new legislation by enactment of an

amending Act, such new legislation is prospective in operation. (Texmann, p.

863). Such an amendment will not affect the substantive or vested rights of

parties unless it is made retrospective expressly or by necessary implication.

(supra). Thus, an amendment of substantive law is not retrospective unless

expressly laid down or by necessary implication inferred (Bhagai Ram Sharma v.

Union of India AIR 1988 SC 740). An amending Act that deals with substantive

rights is only retrospective if there is a clear indication in the legislative language

to that effect.

[141] I would now proceed to examine whether section 163(5) of the amending

Act (Act, No. 22 of 2011) is retrospective as urged by learned counsel for the

Respondent, and thus, whether the assessor is given a new lease of life to extend

the period given to make the assessment from 31.03.2012 to 30.11.2012. A

perusal of the amendments made to the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No.

22 of 2011 reveals that they deal with both procedural and substantive

amendments. The amendments made to section 163(5) of the principal

enactment are prima facie, presumed to have retrospective effect and the

question is whether such presumption of retrospectivity applies to the present

case, in view of section 56 of the Act, No. 22 of 2011.

[142] It was contended on behalf of the Respondent that the purpose of the

Amending Act was designed to give more time to the assessor as the assessor

had only 1 year and 4 months to make the assessment in terms of the previous

Act, which was highly inadequate. It was also submitted that the new Act was

passed for the purpose of supplying an omission in the previous act, and

54

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

therefore the new Act would relate back to the time when the prior Act was

passed.

[143] Dr. Felix strongly relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in Seylan Bank PLC v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra) in support of his contention that the amendment made to section 163(5) by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011 applied with prospective effect and applied to any year of assessment on or after 1 April 2011. He submitted that, therefore, the assessment that expired on 31.03.2012 for the year of assessment 2009/2010 cannot be extended under section 163(5) of the Amending Act, No. 22 of 2011, in view of the express provisions in section 56 of the Amending Act.

[144] In the case of Seylan Bank PLC v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra), the assessor was required to make the assessment for the year of assessment 2007/2008 on or before 30.09.2009 in terms of section 163(5) (a) of the principal Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006. While the said period was still in operation, the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009 was enacted by parliament and it was certified by the Speaker on 31.03.2009, but it came into force on 01.04.2009. By the amending Act, the time period given to the asseesee to file a return was extended by two months and the time period given to the assessor to make the assessment was extended by six months (till 31.03.2011). The assessor made the assessment for the year of assessment 2007/2008 on 09.03.2010 and it was served on the assessee on 26.03.2010. The assessor made the assessment on the basis that the amending Act extended the time period given to the assessor to make the assessment for the year of assessment 2007/2008 by another 6 months, i.e. from 30.09.2009 to 31.03.2010.

Dates on which the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009 came into force

[145] Section 27 of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009 specifically sets out the dates on which the amendments made by the amending Act come into force. Section 27 of the amending Act provides:

(1) The amendments made to paragraph (e) of subsection (2) of section 34, subsection (3) of section 78, subsection (4) of section 113, subsection (2) of section 153 and subsection (2) of section 173 of the principal enactment, by sections 10(2),section 15, section 17, section 19 and section 21, respectively, of this Act, shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into force on April 1, 2006.

55

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

(2) The amendment made to the Second Schedule to the principal enactment by section 25 of this Act, shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into force on April 1, 2007.

(3) The amendment made to section 8, section 40A and section 57 of the principal enactment, by section 3(1) and (2), section 11 and section 13 respectively, of this Act, shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into force on April 1, 2008.

(4) The amendment made to section 13 of the principal enactment by section 5(2) of this Act, shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into force on October 21, 2008.

(5) The amendment made to section 13 by section 5(4) of this Act, shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into force, on February 1, 2009.

(6) The amendments made to the principal enactment by this Act, other than the amendments specifically referred to in subsections (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this section, shall come into force on April 1, 2009.

[146] In terms of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006, the assessor was required to make the assessment for the year of assessment 2007/2008 on or before 30.09.2009. The issue arose before the Court of Appeal (CA/Tax/23/2013 decided on 25.05.2015) was whether the deadline for the assessor to make the assessment for the year of assessment 2007/2008 was extended with prospective effect from the 30.09.2009 to 31.03.2010 in terms of the amending Act, No. 19 of 2009. The Court of Appeal held that even though amendment made to section 163 of the principal enactment operated from 01.04.2010 in terms of section 27(6), the law of the country was changed from 01.04.2009 authorising the assessor to extend the time period to make the assessment by another 6 months and therefore, the assessment made for the year of assessment 2007/2008 on 26.03.2010 is not time barred. The Court of Appeal on an identical issue held:

1. As per section 27(6) of the Amendment Act, the amendment brought into

the section 163 of the principal enactment is in operation from 01st of April 2009. Therefore, the law of the country from the 1st of April 2009 in relation to sending an assessment to the assessee by the assessor is the amended section 163 of the Inland Revenue Act (p.4);

2. Irrespective of whether the asssesee had to submit the tax return on or

before the 30th September 2009 or 30th November 2009, the assessor can

56

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

send the assessment to the assessee within two years immediately succeeding that year of assessment (p.4);

3. As per section 27(6) of the Amending Act, section 163 of the principal

enactment was amended from 1st April 2009 and the amending Act did not operate with retrospective effect but it operated from 01.04.2009. The law of the country was, however, changed from that date (01.04.2009) and from that date, the new law applied (p.5); 4. In terms of the amending Act, the time period given to the assessor to

make the assessment for the year of assessment 2007/2008 was extended from 30.09.2009 to 31.31.03.2010 (p. 4), and therefore, the assessment dated 26.03.2010 made for made for the year 2007/2008 and issued against the Assessee is not time barred (p.6).

[147] It was the submission of Dr. Felix that the Supreme Court rejected this proposition of law enunciated by the Court of Appeal in Seylan Bank v. The The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra), which held that when the law was changed extending the period of assessment, the assessor was entitled to make the assessment within the extended period of limitation, irrespective of the fact that the amending law applied with prospective effect.

[148] The issue before the Supreme Court was, despite the fact that the amendments made to section 163(5) are presumed to have retrospective effect, whether such presumption of retrospective operation was applied to the amendments made to the section 165(3)(a) of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009, in view of the provision in section 27(6), and if so, whether the assessment dated 26.03.2010 for the for the year of assessment 2007/2008 was time barred under and in terms of section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act. The Supreme Court, having considered the effect of section 27(6) of the amending Act, and the absence of express provisions to the contrary held:

Accordingly, the amendments referred to in section 27(1) to (5) of the amending Act are given a retrospective effect from the dated specified therein, in terms of Article 75 of the Constitution.

On the other hand, the amendments that are not referred to in section 27(1) to (5) of the amending Act operate with prospective effect from the 1st April, 2009, in terms of section 27(6) of the amending Act.

Further, although there is a general distinction between substantive law and procedural law, section 27(6) of the amending Act does not distinguish between the amendments made to the substantive law and procedural law of the principal Act (p. 15).

57

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

Thus, in the absence of any reference to a segregation between the two branches of law in the said section, it is not possible to read the words in the said section by a judicial interpretation, and segregate the amendments made to the substantive law and the procedural law of the principal Act.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that section 27(6) of the amending Act was intended to give prospective effect to both the amendments made to the substantive and procedural law of the principal Act, other than those expressly referred to in section 27(1) to (5) of the amending Act;

Therefore, although the amendments made to section 106(1) and 163(5) (a) of the principal Act are procedural in nature, the express provision in section 27(6) of the amending Act excludes the applicability of the general presumption that procedural laws be given retrospective effect (pp 15-16) [Emphasis added). Hence, the amendments made to both sections 106(1) and 163(5) (a) of the principal Act will operate with prospective effect from the 1st April, 2009, in terms of section 27(6) of the amending Act (pp.15-16) [Emphasis added].

[149] Having held that section 27(6) of the amending Act is intended to give prospective effect to both procedural and substantive provisions, and it excludes the applicability of the general presumption, and therefore, the amendment made to section 163(5) will operate with prospective effect from 01.04.2009, the Supreme Court further considered the second question. The second question was whether the assessor alone could benefit from the amendment while the assessee could not, in view of the principle enshrined in Article 12(1) of the Constitution. The Supreme Court held at p.19 that:

Thus, since the appellant had furnished the return of income in accordance with section 163(5)(a) of the principal Act, prior to the said section being amended, a right had accrued to the appellant under the said section to have an assessment of income tax made (if any) within eighteen months from the end of that year of assessment.

Thus, it is necessary to interpret both the said amendments to have prospective effect, to secure equality between the taxpayer and revenue officer in terms of Article 12(1) of the Constitution (p. 20).

[150] At the further hearing before us, the Respondent however, argued that the judgment of the Supreme Court is inapplicable in the present case and it should not be followed for the following reasons.

1. The Supreme Court held that the assessment was time barred on the basis

that the return of income had already been submitted by the assessee when

58

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

the Act, No. 19 of 2009 came into operation, and thus, the assessee could not benefit from the amending Act while the assessor could benefit from the provisions that extended the time within which the assessment could be submitted;

2. In the present case, however, the assessment had not been done by the

time the Act, No. 22 of 2011 came into force and therefore, the time within which an assessment is to be issued was extended by the amending Act, and thus, the assessor is entitled to issue an assessment within the time so extended provided that the amendment became operative prior to the lapse of the timeline under the earlier provision;

3. The time limit within which an act is required to be done, ought to be

ascertained with reference to when that particular act was done (making of the assessment) and not by reference to the impact of the law would have on another act (tendering the return) as held in the Indian case of Super Cast Alloy Foundries Ltd v. Commissioner of Income Tax (2005) 275 IER 195). 4. The Supreme Court considered the combined effect of section 106(1) and

section 163(5) of the Act and thus, the basis of the judgment related to the inability of the taxpayer to benefit from the extended period of time given to the taxpayer to file return while the assessor could benefit from the extended period given to make the assessment, since the taxpayer had already filed return by the time the Act. No. 19 of 2000 came into force;

5. The intention of the legislature by amending section 163(5) of the principal

enactment by the Act No. 22 of 2011 was to grant a right only to the assessor, and thus, the assessor has a right to make the assessment within the extended period of time;

6. The Supreme Court failed to consider the principle enunciated in the Indian

case of Super Cast Alloy Foundries Ltd v. Commissioner of Income Tax (2005) 275 IER 195);

[151] In view of these submissions, it is necessary to identify the ratio on which the Supreme held that the amendments made to section 163(5)(a) of the Act, No. 19 of 2009 have no application to the year of assessment 2007/2008, and the assessment made by the assessor is time barred. A careful reading of the Supreme Court judgement in Seylan Bank PLC v. The Commissioner General of

59

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

Inland Revenue (supra) reveals that the Supreme Court judgment has the following two parts.

1. Although the amendment made to section 163(5) of the Act, No. 19 of 2009

is presumed to have retrospective effect, such presumption of retrospective effect will not apply when the express provision in section 27(6) of the amending Act excludes the applicability of the general presumption (i.e. that procedural laws be given retrospective effect) and hence, the amendment made to section 163(5) will operate with prospective effect from 01.04.2009 for the year of assessment 2007/2008 in terms of section 27(6) of the amending Act;

2. The taxpayer had furnished the return prior to the amending Act came into

force, and thus, a right had accrued to the taxpayer under section 163(5) (a) to have an assessment made within 18 months from the end of that year of assessment. If the year of assessment is extended with retrospective effect, it would only benefit the assessor but it deprived the taxpayer who is unable to file a return within the extended period under section 106(1), that infringes Article 12 (1) of the Constitutio that guarantees the equal protection of the law;

[152] It is crystal clear that it is only the first part of the Supreme Court decision that reprersents ratio decidendi of the decision-the reason and the spitit of the decision. Namely that (i) although the amendment made to section 163(5) is presumed to have retrospective effect, the express provision in section 27(6) of the amending Act excludes the applicability of the general presumption of retrospectivity, or the restrospective operation of that section was rebutted by the express exclusion in section 27(6); and (ii) the amending Act operates with prospective effect from 01.04.2009. The effect of this part of the decision is that the amendment made to section 163(5) of the principal enactment is only prospective and applicable for any year of assessment on or after 1 April 2009 and not before 01.04.2009 and hence, it has no application to the year of assessment 2007/2008.

[153] Section 106(1) of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009, extended the time period given to the taxpayer to furnish a return by two months from 30.09.2010 to 30.11.2010. In the present case, the assessee furnished its return on 20.08.2010 and the Act, No. 22 of 2011 came into force on 01.04.2011 and the assessment was made on 30.11.2012. Thus, by the time the Act, No. 22 of 2011 came into force, the taxpayer had already filed its return. With regard to the second part of the decision, it is not in dispute that the time period for

60

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

making the assessment had not expired by the time the amendments were made to section 163(5) of the principal enactment. The second part of the judgment related to the inability of the assessee to benefit from the extended period given to file the return under the Act, No. 19 of 2009 and therefore, the law should not be interpreted to give an advantage to an assessor and deprive an assessee in violation of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution as held by the Supreme Court in Seylan Bank decision. It is an additional factor in that individual case for the Supreme Court to hold that the law should not be interpreted to give an advantage to an assessor and deprive an assessee in violation of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. The second part of the judgment related to the inability of the assessee to benefit from the extended period given to file the return under Act, No. 19 of 2009 and therefore, the assessee had a right to have the assessment passed within the 18 months from the end of that year. It is only an additional factor in that particulae case, in holding that the amendments made to section 163(5) have no application to the year of assessment 2007/2008.

[154] It was argued on behalf of the Respondent that (i) the purpose of the

amendment made to section 163(5) of the principal enactment by the Act, No.

19 of 2009 was to extend the time period given to the taxpayer to furnish the

return, and to the assessor to make the assessment; (ii) the purpose of the

amendment made to section 163(5) of the principal enactment by the Act, No.

22 of 2011 was only to extend the time period given to the assessor to make the

assessment from 31st March to 30th November. On that basis, the Respondent

argued that the judgment of the Seylan Bank, which is based on the

interpretation of the amendments made to both sections 106(1) and 163(5) of

the principal enactment by the Act, No. 19 of 2009, would not apply to the

present case and therefore, the assessor, in the present case, has a right to

extend the period given to make the assessment from 31st March to 30th

November in terms of the Act, No. 22 of 2011. The Respondent has however,

failed to explan the legal effect of section 27(6) of the Act, No. 19 of 2009, which

expressly excludes the retrospective operation of that amendment and provides

that the effective date of the amendment shall be 01.04.2009.

[155] Although the Supreme Court considered the combined effect of section

106(1) and section 163(5) of that Act, No. 19 of 2009, the Supreme Court was

clearly guided by the legislative intention in section 27(6) of the amending Act,

No. 19 of 2009. As noted, the Supreme Court clearly held that section 27(6)

expressly excludes the applicability of the general presumption that procedural

laws be given retrospective effect and that the amendments made to the

principal enactment, (which includes s. 163(5)), other than the amendments

61

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

specifically referred to in section 27, shall come into force on April 1, 2009. (see-

pp 15-16 of the Supreme Court judgment).

[156] The Supreme Court clearly held in Seylan Bank v. The The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra) that although the amendment made to section 163(5) is presumed to have retrospective effect, the express provision in section 27(6) of the amending Act excludes the applicability of the general presumption of retrospectivity, and therefore, the amendment made to section 163(5) of the principal enactment does not apply to the year of assessment 2007/2008, in terms of section 27(6) of the Act, No. 19 of 2009.

Decision of the High Court in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Super Cast Alloy Foundries Ltd. ,

[157] The Respondent strongly relied on the decision of the Gujarat High Court in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Super Cast Alloy Foundries Ltd. (2005) 194 CTR Guj 194, 2005 275 ITR 199 Guj decided on 02.02.2005) in support of the contention that as the assessment had not been made by the time the amending Act was enacted, the assessor gets an extended lease of life (extended period of time), and therefore, the assssessor had a right to make the assessment during the extended period of time until 30.11.2013.

[158) I desire, to consider the question whether the Indian High Court case in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Super Cast Alloy Foundries Ltd. (Supra), applies to decide the time bar of the assessment for the year of assessment 2009/2010 in the present case under the Inland Revenue Act of Sri Lanka. In Commissioner of Income Tax v. Super Cast Alloy Foundries Ltd. (Supra), the High Court was interpreting section 154 of Income Tax Act of India, 1961. The issue was whether on the facts and in the circumstances, the Appellate Tribunal was right in law in holding that rectification order dated.31.3.86 under Section 154 of the Income Tax Act of India 1961 in respect of the assessment order dated 25.3.82 was barred by time on the ground that un-amended provisions of Section 154(7).

[159] Section 154 - Rectification of mistake

1a[(1) With a view to rectifying any mistake apparent from the record an income-tax authority referred to in section 116 may, -

(a) making the amendment ; or (b) refusing to allow the claim.]

[160] The Assessment Year was 1979-80 and the relevant accounting period was 31st December, 1978. The assessment order was made under Section 143(3) of the Act on 25th March, 1982. The Assessing Officer passed an order under Section 154 of the Act for the purposes of reworking the depreciation allowance to which the assessee was entitled and the said order was made on 31st March, 1986.

[161] The case of the assessee was that the period of limitation for passing an

order of rectification is prescribed under Section 154(7) of the Act and that

provision was amended by Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 1984 w.e.f. 1st

October, 1984, but the time limit of four years from the date of assessment order

had to be taken into consideration and not the amended provision. On the other

hand, the Revenue, argued that once the provision was amended, the extended

period of limitation would apply and if the said amended provision was applied

to the facts of the case, the order of rectification under Section 154 of the Act

was within the period of limitation. The question, therefore, was whether the

rectification order made on 31.03.1986 was time barred in terms of section

155(4) by virtue of the amended Act, which came into effect from 1st October.The

relevant provision before the amendment reads as under :

"(7) Save as otherwise provided in Section 155 or sub-section (4) of Section 186 no amendment under this section shall be made after the expiry of four years from the date of the order sought to be amended."

[162] The relevant provision after the amendment reads as under :

"(7) Save as otherwise provided in Section 155 or sub-section (4) of Section 186 no amendment under this section shall be made after the expiry of four years [from the end of the financial year in which the order sought to be amended was passed.]"

[163] Section 155 (4) of the INCOME-TAX ACT, 1961 reads as follows:

64

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

(4) Where as a result of proceedings initiated under section 147, a loss or depreciation has been recomputed and in consequence thereof it is necessary to recompute the total income of the assessee for the succeeding year or years to which the loss or depreciation allowance has been carried forward and set-off under the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 72, or sub-section (2) of section 73, or 1e[sub-section (1) or sub-section (3) of section 74,] 1f[or subsection (3) of section 74A,] the 1g[Assessing Officer] may proceed to recompute the total income in respect of such year or years and make the necessary amendment ; and the provisions of section 154 shall, so far as may be, apply thereto, the period of four years specified in sub-section (7) of that section being reckoned 1b[from the end of the financial year in which the order was passed] under section 147.

[164] The assessment order was dated 25th March, 1982. The Assessor under the

provision before the amendment was permitted to amend an order within the

period of four years from the date of the order sought to be amended. The

original period of limitation under the unamended provision would have expired

on 24th March, 1986. The amendment of Section 154(7) of the Act which came

into effect from 1st October, 1984. By virtue of the amended provision, the

period of limitation within which an order could be rectified stood extended by

as much as the period of four years had to be computed from the end of the

financial year in which the order sought to be amended was passed. By virtue of

the amendment, the said period stood extended to 31st March, 1986 and the

rectification order has admittedly been made on 31st March, 1986.

[165] The assessment order was dated 25th March, 1982. The original period of

limitation under the unamended provision would have expired on 24th March,

1986. However, by virtue of the amendment carried out by the Taxation Laws

(Amendment) Act the said period stood extended to 31st March, 1986 and the

rectification order has admittedly been made on 31st March, 1986. Under such

circumstances, the High Court held that (i) the original period of limitation under

the unamended provision that would have expired on 24th March, 1986, stood

extended to 31st March, 1986 under the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act; (ii)

therefore, the order of the Tribunal holding that the rectification order was

barred by limitation is not correct as there is no indication in the context of the

Amendment Act, nor is there any express provision which would prohibit the

assessing authority from passing an order of rectification within the extended

period of limitation. The High Court in fact looked for rebuttal evidence in the

Act itself, either to prohibit the assessor from passing an order within the

65

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

extended period of limitation or allow the assessor to pass an order in the

absence of such express provision.

Existence or absence of any express provision and rebuttal of presumption of retrospectivity

[166] Significantly, the High Court considered whether the limitation provision in section Section 154(7) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 has been rebutted by any express provision in the Amendment Act itself or where there is any express provision in the Amending Act, which would prohibit the assessing authority from passing an order of rectification within the extended period of limitation. The High Court held that there is no any express provision which would prohibit the assessing authority from passing an order of rectification within the extended period of limitation. The High Court stated at paragraph 10:

10. In light of the aforesaid settled position of law, the impugned order of the Tribunal holding that the rectification order was barred by limitation is not correct. There is no indication in the context of the Amendment Act, nor is there any express provision which would prohibit the assessing authority from passing an order of rectification within the extended period of limitation.

[167] The same question was considered in the Indian case of Commissioner of

Income Tax v. Royal Motor Car Co. [1977]107ITR753(Guj), and while holding that

when the legislature makes changes to the procedural limitation period in

pending proceedings, the new section would apply after the Amendment where

the entire old section was substituted by the new section, unless there is

something in the context or by express words the legislature has expressed it. In

Commissioner of Income Tax v. Royal Motor Car Co. (supra), it was stated:

"..... It is well-settled law that as regards matters of procedure, the legislature can make changes and those changes would apply so far as the limitation is concerned to pending proceedings unless a vested right has accrued to any party by reason of the old period of limitation having expired. ..... "

"At least so far as the question of limitation is concerned, it is obvious that the old section cannot apply after the Amendment Act since the entire old section was substituted by the new section and what we are concerned with in the present case is the application of the well-settled rule of law that limitation is a matter of procedure and unless there is something in the context or by express words the legislature has expressed it, new period of limitation would always apply to pending proceedings as well. ..... "

66

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[168] In my view, an amending Act which only affects procedure is presumed to

be retrospective unless the Act provides otherwise-meaning, the Court should

at the question whether its retrospective operation has been rebutted by any

express provision in the same Act (Shyam Sunder v. Raj Kumar (2001) 8 SCC 24).

In Shyam Sunder v. Raj Kumar (supra), it was stated:

From the aforesaid decisions the legal position that emerges is that when a repeal of an enactment is followed by a fresh legislation such legislation does not effect the substantive rights of the parties on the date of suit or adjudication of suit unless such a legislation is retrospective and a court of appeal cannot take into consideration a new law brought into existence after the judgment appealed from has been rendered because the rights of the parties in an appeal are determined under the law in force on the date of suit. However, the position in law would be different in the matters which relate to procedural law but so far as substantive rights of parties are concerned they remain unaffected by the amendment in the enactment. We are, therefore, of the view that where a repeal of provisions of an enactment is followed by fresh legislation by an amending Act, such legislation is prospective in operation and does not affect substantive or vested rights of the parties unless made retrospective either expressly or by necessary intendment. We are further of the view that there is a presumption against the retrospective operation of a statute and further a statute is not to be construed to have a greater retrospective operation than its language renders necessary, but an amending Act which affects the procedure is presumed to be retrospective, unless amending Act provides otherwise (emphasis added).

Rebuttal of Presumption of Retrospectivity

[169] This raises the question whether the presumption of retrospective operation

of any procedural enactment made by Act, No. 22 of 2011 has been rebutted by

any express provision of the same Act. There is no dispute that the period of

limitation for making the assessment had not expired when the amendment was

made to the Inland Revenue Act by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22

of 2011. Even if it is assumed that the period of limitation for making the

assessment had not expired when the amendment was made to the principal

enactment by the Act, No. 22 of 2011, the crucial question is whether the

legislature has expressed something by express words that would prohibit the

assesser from using such amendment and making an assessment within such

extended period of limitation. In short, the question is whether the presumption

of retrospectivity in relation to procedural limitation made to the principal

67

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

enactment by the Act, No. 22 Act, No. 22 of 2011 has been rebutted by any

express provision in that Act itself.

[170] In regard to the rebuttal of the presumption, it is relevant to note that any

amending Act may provide either by any express provision or by implication

affecting the procedure that is presumed to be retrospective effect. It is true that

where a statute is passed for the purpose of supplying an obvious omission in a

former statute, the subsequent statute would generally relate back to the time

when the prior Act was passed unless the provides otherwise indicating the

legislative intention against retrospective operation. Although an Amending Act

affecting procedure is presumed to be retrospective, the presumption could be

rebutted when the Amending Act in section 56 expressly or by implication,

indicates in the legislative language to the effect that the amendment made to

the principal enactment by the provisions of the Act, No. 22 of 2011 [(including

section 163(5)], shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into force on April

1, 2011. Now the question is whether the presumption of retrospective operation

of the limitation period has been rebutted by any express provision in the Inland

Revenie (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011 itself.

Exclusivity of Retrospective operation by section 56 of the Act No. 22 of 2011

Dates on which the amendments made to section 163(5) came into force

[171] Similar to section 27 of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of

2009, section 56 of the Act, No 22 of 2011 specifically sets out the dates on which

the amendments made to the Inland Revenue Act, shall come into force. Section

56 of the Amending Act provides that certain amendments are procedural in

nature while amendments made to sections 7, 21, 21, and 21A of the principal

enactment by the Amending Act are of substantive in nature. Section 56 of the

amending Act provides:

56. The amendments made to the principal enactment by the provisions of this Act, shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into force on April 1, 2011.

Provided that-

(a) the amendments made to section 7 of the principal enactment by

subsection (2) of section 3 of this Act, shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into force on April 1. 2008;

68

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

(b) the amendments made to sections 20, 21 and 21a of the principal enactment

by section 10, section 11 and section 12 respectively of this Act, shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into force on April 1, 2009. Effect of section 56 of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011

[172] Section 56 of the Act, No. 22 of 2011 clearly provides that the amendments

made to the principal enactment by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No.

22 of 2011, other than the amendments specifically referred to in the proviso to

section 56 of the said Act, shall come into force on April 1, 2011. The legislative

intention is to ensure that the amendments that are specifically referred to in the

proviso to section 56 of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011,

operate with retrospective effect from the dates specified therein while all other

amendments made to the principal enactment, including the amendments made

to section 163(5) operate with prospective effect from April, 1, 2011. If the

legislative intention was to extend the period given to the assessor from

31.03.2012 to 30.11.2012 for any year of assessment prior to 01.04.2009, there

was no reason for the legislature to provide in express terms that the

amendments made to the principal enactment including section 163(5) by the

provisions of the Act No, 22 of 2011, other than the amendments referred to in

section 56, shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into force on April 1,

2011. If a gap is disclosed in the Legislature, the remedy lies is an amending Act,

and not in a usurpation of the legislative function under the thin disguise of

interpretation and read words into the section which are not there, by a judicial

interpretation and to defeat the intention of the legislature.

[173] Although the amendment made to section 163(5) of the principal

enactment is of a procedural nature, and is presumed to have retrospective effect,

the presumption of retrospectivity has been excluded or rebutted by the express

provision in section 56 of the same Act. Section 56 expresslly provides that the

amendment made to section 163(5) applies with prospective effect (w.e.f.

01.04.2011) and thus, it is not possible for the assessor to extend the time period

for making the assessment for the year of assessment 2009/2010 from 31.03.2012

to 30.11.2012.

[174] A perusal of the decision in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Super Cast Alloy Foundries Ltd. and the relevant provisions of section 154 or 155 of the Income Tax Act of India reveal that the is nothing to indicate that the limitation provisions of the Income Tax Act of India restrict the effective date of the limitation

69

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

provisions similar to section 56 of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011. In the present case, the assessment was made on 26.11.2012 and the notice of assessment is dated 30.11.2012. The amendments made to section 163(5) of the principal enactment by the Act, No. 22 of 2011 operates with prospective effect from 01.04.2011, which means that the amendments made to section 163(5) of the principal enactment by the Act, No. 22 of 2011 is applicable for any year of assessment on or after 1 April 2011 and not to the year of assessment 2009/2010 in terms of section 56 of the Act, No. 22 of 2011. Accordingly, it is not possible to disregard the first part of the decision of the Supreme Court in Seylan Bank v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra), and apply only the second part of the decision as against the express statutory provision in section 56 of the Act, No. 22 of 2011 in the present case.

[175] For those reasons, I hold that the amendments made to section 163(5) by

the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011 operates with prospective

effect from 01.04.2011 in terms of section 56 of the said amending Act.

Accordingly, the amendments made to section 163(5) of the principal enactment

by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2011 has no effect relating to

the year of assessment 2009/2010. The assessor does not get an extended lease

of life to make the assessment for the year of assessment 2009/2010 after the

time period for making the assessment expired on 31.03.2012.

[176] Before I part with this judgment, I must place on record that for the reasons

stated in this judgment, this Court is bound by the judgment of the Supreme

Court in Seylan Bank PLC v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (Supra).

This Court is not bound by the judgment of the Gujarat High Court in

Commissioner of Income Tax v. Super Cast Alloy Foundries Ltd. (supra), when

there is a statutory provision in the Act, No. 22 of 2011, which expressly provides

that the amendment made to section 163(5) of the principal enactment, shall for

all purposes, come into force from 01.04.2011. In any event, the said Indian

decision applied unless there is any express provision in the Amendment Act itself

which prohibits the assessor from passing an order of rectification within the

extended period of limitation. For those, reasons, I am not inclined to agree with

the Respondents argument that the amending Act, No. 22 of 2011 extended the

time period given to the assessor to make the assessment for the year of

assessment 2009/2010 from 31.03.2012 to 30.11.2012, after the time bar period

expired on 31.03.2012.

[177] For those reasons, I hold that although the assessment was made on

26.11.2012, the assessment for the year of assessment 2009/2010 was time barred

70

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

when it was not made on or before 31.03.2012 in terms of section 163(5) of the

Inland Revenue Act (as amended). For those reasons, the question of law No. 3 is

answered in favour of the Appellant.

Question of Law Nos.4 & 5

Is the Appellant entitled to the Concessionary Tax Rate conferred by Sections 42 and 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006

[178] It is not in dispute that the principal activity of the Appellant is the supply

of marine fuel and lubricants to local and foreign vessels. At the hearing of the

Appeal, Mr. Romesh de Silva, P.C. submitted that the Appellant being a supplier

of bunker fuel to ships is engaged in exporting bunker fuel to a buyer abroad

within the contemplation of Section 42 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006

(as amended) and therefore, it is entitled to the concessionary rate of 10%

specified in the Fifth Schedule to the Act or in the alternative, to the

concessionary rate of 15% specified in the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue

Act. He further submitted that although the term export is not defined in the

Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended), the question of whether the

Appellant qualifies for the concessionary tax rates under Sections 42 or 52 of the

Inland Reveue Act would have to be decided by resorting to other definitions of

export in other statutes.

[179] Mr. de Silva further submitted that the supply of bunker fuel qualifies as

an export when Appellant satisfies the test of act of taking out of Sri Lanka

as specified in Section 22 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, No. 1 of 1969,

which is further confirmed by Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance. He referred

to the definition of the term export set out in several Dictionaries and judicial

authorities and submitted that the Appellant has established that the bunker fuel

had been taken out of the Sri Lankan territorial waters, and the moment the

bunker fuel is taken out of Sri Lanka, the act of exportation is complete and thus,

the Appellant must be deemed to be an exporter.

[180] Mr. de Silva strenuously argued that the real test is whether ot not the

goods were taken out of Sri Lanka and once the act of taking out of Sri Lanka is

established, the final destination of the goods, and the intent of the person to

dispose or leave such goods in a particular destination becomes irrelevant. On

the basis, Mr. de Silva, submitted that the supply of bunker fuel to a foreign

going ship constitutes an export and therefore, the Appellant is eligible for the

71

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

concessionary tax rates under Sections 42 and 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No.

10 of 2006 (as amended).

[181] On the other hand, the learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that

the Appellants transactions do not constitute exports under any of the four

legal standards or tests that are recognized as characteristics of an export such

as (i) there should be an act of taking out of Sri Lanka; (ii) the goods must reach

a final destination outside Sri Lanka; (iii) the transaction must involve an export

from one country, and an import into another country; and (iv) the transaction

should possess the characteristics of an international sale of goods transaction

[182] She submitted that the Appellant neither took the goods outside Sri Lanka,

nor caused the foreign vessel to take the goods outside Sri Lanka with a final

destination outside Sri Lanka as the contracts entered by the Appellant do not

provide for a terminus outside the territorial waters of Sri Lanka. She submitted

that as far as the Appellant was concerned, the terminus was within Sri Lanka,

and the transaction between the Appellant and the vessel owners/charterers

was a local transaction that took place within the territorial waters of Sri Lanka

and thus, the final destination was not outside Sri Lanka. She further submitted

that in any event, the Appellant had no control over the ships journeys; and thus,

it is manifest that the goods have remained within the territorial waters of Sri

Lanka, indefinitely.

[183] Referring to the test of international sale of goods transaction, she argued that the Appellant has failed to produce a single document such as a Bill of Lading, Marine Insurance, invoices and letters of credit, and that the Appellants documents do not support that its transaction could be chaterertised as international sale of goods transaction. She argued, therefore, that the supply of bunker fuel was no export within the meaning of Section 42 or qualified export within the meaning of Section 52 of the Inland Revenue Act.

[184] The Tax Appeals Commission in holding that the bunker fuel supplied by

the Appellant to ships travelling from Sri Lanka cannot constitute an export in

the absence of a foreign destination, relied on the test adopted by Hidayatullah

J. in the Indian Supreme Court case in Burmah-Shell Oil Storage & Distribution

Company Ltd v. Commercial Taxing Office and Othes [1961]1SCR 902. That was

a case relating to the sale and delivery of aviation spirits to Aircrafts proceeding

abroad and belonging to several companies. The question arose was whether

the sale and delivery of aviation spirits to Aircrafts constitutes an export.

72

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[185] In Burmah-Shell Oil Storage & Distribution Company Ltd v. Commercial

Taxing Office and Othes (supra), the Indian Supreme Court held that in the

context and setting in which the expression export out of the territory of India

occurs in Part XII of the Constitution, it was not sufficient that goods were merely

moved out of the territory of India, but that it was further necessary that the

goods should be intended to be transported to a destination beyond India, so

that aviation spirit sold to an aircraft for enabling it to fly out of the country was

not exported out of the country. Referring to the word export, Hidayatullah

J., further stated that (i) the test is that the goods must have a foreign

destination where they can be said to be imported; (ii) the crucial fact is the

sending of the goods to a foreign destination where they would be received as

imports; and (iii) the two notions of export and import, thus, go in pairs.... and as

long as it does not satisfy this test, it cannot be said that the sale was in the

course of export. .. Under such circumstances, Hidayatulla J. stated at paragraph

37:

Applying these several tests to the cases on hand, it is quite plaint that aviation sprit loaded on board an aircraft for consumption, though taken out of the country, is not exported since it has no destination where it can be said to be imported, and so long as it does not satisfy this test, it cannot be said that the sale was in the course of export. Further, as has already been pointed out, the sales can hardly be said to occasion the export. The seller sells aviation sprit for the use of the aircraft, and the sale is not integrally connected with the taking out of aviation sprit. The sale is not even for the purpose of export, as explained above. It does not come within the course of export, which requires an even deeper relation. The sales, thus, do not come within Article 286 (1)(b).

[186] It was the contention of Mr. de Silva that the concept of export in India as

reflected in the Indian authorities is based on different principles such as the

existence of two termini and the intention of their being landed in a different

port. He submitted that the real test is whether or not the bunker fuel was taken

out of the Sri Lankan territorial waters and therefore, the Indian authorities are

irrelevant for the purpose of deciding the concessionary tax rate under Sections

42 and 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended).

[187] It is true that the decision in Burmah-Shell Oil Storage & Distribution

Company Ltd v. Commercial Taxing Office and Othes (supra) is based on

constitutional provisions of the Indian Constitution, [Article 286 (1) (b)] and

Section 5 of the CENTRAL SALES TAX ACT to define the word export and such

73

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

principles are not binding on the Courts of Sri Lanka. Hence, this Court is called

upon to decide the question of whether the supply of bunker fuel to ships

constitutes an export under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No.

10 of 2006, independent of the Indian authorities in particular, the case of

Burmah-Shell Oil Storage & Distribution Company Ltd v Commercial Taxing

Office and Othes (supra).

Statutory Provisions

[188] Before embarking upon the rival contentions of the parties, I may proceed

to notice the relevant statutory provisions which have a bearing on the issue.

Section 42 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended), which sets

out the rate of income tax on profits and income arising in Sri Lanka to the

consignor or consignee from certain exports. It provides as follows:

42 (1) The profits and income, for the year of assessment on April 1, 2006, arising in Sri Lanka to a consignor or consignee, from the export of

(a) any precious stones or metals not mined in Sri Lanka;

(b) any petroleum, gas or petroleum products; or

(c) such other products as may be approved by the Minister for the purposes of this paragraph, having regard to the foreign exchange benefits that are likely to accrue to the country from the export of such products, being goods brought to Sri Lanka on a consignment basis, and re-exported without subjecting such goods to any process of manufacture, shall be liable to income tax at the appropriate rate specified in the Fifth Schedule to this Act.

(2) The profits and income for any year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2007, but prior to April 1, 2011 arising in Sri Lanka to any consignor or consignee from the export of any goods brought to Sri Lanka on a consignment basis and re-exported without subjecting such goods to any process of manufacture, shall be liable to income tax at the appropriate rate specified in the Fifth Schedule to this Act.

[189] Section 52 of the of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 as amended, which sets out the rate of income tax on qualified export profits and income of a company which carries on any specified undertaking as follows:

52-Where any company commenced prior to November 10, 1993, to carry on any specified undertaking and the taxable income of that company for any year of assessment includes any qualified export profits and income from such specified undertaking, such part of such taxable income as consists of such qualified export profits and income, shall, notwithstanding anything to

74

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

the contrary in this Act, be chargeable with income tax at the appropriate rate specified in the Fifth Schedule to this Act.

Exporting and importing are two sides of the same coin; both supply

customers with products manufactured outside the country.

[190] Section 60 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 interprets the terms export turnover, qualified export profits and income and specified undertaking for the purpose Chapter IX as follows:

60. For the purposes of this Chapter

(a)export turnover in relation to any specified undertaking means the total amount receivable, whether, received or not, by that undertaking from the export of goods or commodities or from the provision of any service referred to sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (c), but does not include

(i) any amount receivable, whether received or not, from the export of gems or jewellery or from the sale of any capital assets;

(ii) any amount receivable, whether received or not-from the export of black tea not in packet or package form and each packet or package weighing not more than one kilogram, crepe rubber, and, sheet rubber, scrap rubber, latex or fresh coconuts; or

(iii) any profits and income not being profits and income within the meaning of paragraph (a) of section 3;

(b) qualified export profits and income in relation to any person, means the sum which bears to the profits and income within the meaning of paragraph (a) of section 3, after excluding there from any profits and income from the sale of gems and jewellery and any profits and income from the sale of capital assets, for that year of assessment from any specified undertaking carried on by such person, ascertained in accordance with the provisions of this Act, the same proportion as the export turnover of that undertaking for that year of assessment bears to the total turnover of that undertaking for that year of assessment;

(c) specified undertaking means any undertaking which is engaged in

(i) the export of non-traditional goods manufactured, produced or purchased by such undertaking; or

(ii) the performance of any service of ship repair, ship breaking repair and refurbishment of marine cargo containers, provision of computer software, computer programmes, computer systems or recording computer data, or such other services as may be specified by the Minister by Notice published in the Gazette, for payment in foreign currency; and

75

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

(d) total turnover in relation to any specified undertaking means the total amount receivable, whether received or not, by that undertaking from any trade or business carried on by that undertaking, but does not include any amount receivable, whether received or not, from the sale of capital assets, gems or jewellery or any profits and income not being profits and income within the meaning of paragraph (a) of section 3.

For the purposes of this section the expression non- traditional goods means goods other than black tea not in packet or package form and each packet or package weighing not more than one kilogram, crepe rubber, sheet rubber, scrap rubber, latex or fresh coconuts or any other products referred to in section 16, but include organic tea in bulk.

Rates specified in the Fifth Schedule

[191] The Fifth Schedule specifies the rates for the application of Sections 42 and 52 as follows:

Fifth Schedule

The following rates shall be applicable notwithstanding the rates specified in

the First, Second and Third Schedules.

6. The rate of income tax on profits and income arising before April 1, 2011, to any consignor or consignee from entrepot trade involving precious stones, metals not mined in Sri Lanka or any petroleum , gas or petroleum products or such other approved products (section 42) 10 per centum

18. The rate of income tax on qualified export profits and income of a company, which commenced to carry on any specified undertaking prior to April 1, 2015, for-

(a) any year of assessment commencing prior to April 1, 2011 15 per centum

(b) any year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2011 (Section 52)

12 per centum

[192] To be eligible for the concessionary tax rate under Section 42 of the Inland

Revenue Act, as specified in the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10

of 2006, the Appellant must satisfy that:

I. It has brought goods into Sri Lanka on a consignment basis; and

II. It is re-exporting such goods without subjecting it to any process of

manufacture;

76

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[193] The term re-export is the process of exporting goods that

were previously imported into a country in the same state as previously

imported (Cambridge English Dictionary). At the hearing, both Counsel made

submissions on the question as to whether the activity of the Appellant

constitutes an export within the meaning of Sections 42 or qualified export

within the meaning of Section 52 of the Inland Revenue Act. The fundamental

question that arises for consideration is whether or not, the supply of bunker

fuel to ship by the Appellant constitutes an export within the meaning of

Sections 42 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006.

[194] On the other hand, the Appellant contends that it being a specified

undertaking earned a qualified export profits and income from such undertaking

and therefore, the Appellant being an qualified exporter falls within the meaning

of Section 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended). The

fundamental question that arises for consideration is whether or not, the profits

and income of the Appellant being a specified undertaking were derived from

the export of bunker fuel to be treated as a qualified export profits and income

within the meaning of Section 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as

amended).

Issue

[195] Accordingly, this case stated raises an interesting, but intricate the

fundamental question whether or not the supply of bunker fuel to vessels

constitutes an export within the meaning of Section 42 or 52 of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended) to be eligible for the concessionary

rate of tax specified in the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of

2006 (as amended).

Definition of the termexport

[196] As the Inland Revenue Act does not provide a statutory definition to the term export, this Court has to decide what is envisaged by the term export for the purpose of Sections 42 and 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006. It has now become necessary to construe the scope of the term export by using its ordinary or literal meanings in common parlance as understood in its natural and grammatic manner in the context in which it occurs for the application of Sections 42 and 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No 10 of 2006 as amended.

77

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[197] Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes (12th Edition, page 28), deals with

the concept of literal construction in the following words:

The first and most elementary rule of construction is that is it is to be assumed that the words and phrases of technical legislation are used in their technical meaning if they have acquired one, and otherwise in their ordinary meaning, and the second is that the phrases and sentences are to be construed according to the rules of grammar. 'The length and detail of modern legislation, wrote Lord Evershed M.R., 'has undoubtedly reinforced the claim of literal construction as the only safe rule.' If there is nothing to modify, alter or qualify the language which the statute contains, it must be construed in the ordinary and natural meaning of the words and sentences. The safer and more correct course of dealing with a question of construction is to take the words themselves and arrive if possible at their meaning without, in the first instance, reference to cases.

[198] In Craies on Statute Law (7th Edition, page 65), it is stated that:

Where the language of an Act is clear and explicit, we must give effect to it, whatever may be the consequences, for in that case the words of the statute speak the intention of the legislature.

[199] In M.N. Dastur and Co. Ltd. and Ors. vs. Union of India (UOI) and Ors.

(28.02.2005 - CALHC), it was stated that

Words used in a statute dealing with matters relating to the general public are presumed to have been used in their popular rather than narrow, legal or technical sense. The doctrine of Loquitur ut vulgus, i.e., according to the common understanding and acceptance of the terms, is to be applied in construing the words used in the statute dealing with matters relating to the public in general. If an Act is directed to dealings with matters affecting everybody generally, the words used, have the meaning attached to them in the common and ordinary use of language.

[200] Lord Easter, in Unwin v. Hanson (1891) 2 QB 115 (CA) has further explained

the manner in which the words used in statutes dealing with matters relating to

the public in general are construed at page 119 as follows:

Now when we have to consider the construction of words such as this

occurring in Acts of Parliament, we must treat the question thus: If the

Act is directed to dealing with matters affecting everybody generally, the words used have the meaning attached to them in the common and

78

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

ordinary use of language. If the Act is one passed with reference to a particular trade, business, or transaction, and words are used which everybody conversant with that trade, business, or transaction, knows and understands to have a particular meaning in it, then the words are to be construed as having that particular meaning, though it may differ from the common or ordinary meaning of the words.

[201] In the Blacks Law Dictionary, Revised Edition, the term export is defined

in the following manner:

EXPORT, v. To carry or to send abroad. Tennessee Oil Co. v. McCanless, 178 Tenn: 683, 157 S.W. 2d 267, 271, 272. To send, take, or carry an article of trade or commerce out of the country. To transport merchandise from one country to another in the course of trade. To carry out or convey goods by sea. State v. Turner, 5 Har., Del., 501....

"Export," in its primary sense, means to carry or send out of a place, and in secondary sense means to carry from one state or country. McKesson & Robbins v. Collins, 18 Cal.App.2d 648, 64 P.2d 469, 470.

[202] The definition of export from the Oxford Advanced American Dictionary

is the selling and transporting of goods to another country. In Cambridge

Advance Learners Dictionary defines the term exportation as the process of

sending goods to another country for sale. In the Merriam-Webster Online

Dictionary, the term export means to carry or send (something, such as a

commodity) to some other place (such as another country). Accordingly, the

Dictionary meaning of the word export of goods as normally understood is

sending goods from one country to another country for sale.

[203] However, the meaning of a word in a statute may also be affected by its

context, which may consist of surrounding sections, the whole Act or the

scheme or purpose of the legislation and the exceptions or deduction granted

thereunder. Thus, one has to construe the scope of the term export in the

context in which it occurs in Sections 42 and 52 of the Inland Revenue Act,

having regard to the nature of the goods that are to be exported, namely, the

bunker fuel being a petroleum product which is not manufactured in Sri

Lanka but, used for the navigation of vessels, and the purpose for which such

exports are qualified for concessionary tax rates under the Inland Revenue

Act.

Imports & Exports (Control) Act

79

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[204] The Appellant, however argues that as the Inland Revenue Act does not

define the term export, nor does it specify the criteria that must be

affirmatively satisfied in order that a supply may be classified as an export,

recourse must be had to the general principles of law applicable for the

purposes of determining what constitutes an export. This Court is now required

to find out what is meant by the phrase " export" for the purpose of the Section

42 and 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, and whether the mere supply of bunker

fuel to a ship constitutes an export under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Reveue

Act, No. 10 of 2006.

[205] The Appellant relies on the definition of the term exportation given in

the Stroud Judicial Dictionary, Vo. II 1903 referring to the decision in A.G. v

Pougett 2 Price, 381) and Stockton Ry v. Barrett, 11 Cl. & F. 590) in support of

his contention that the word export for the purpose of the Inland Revenue

Act, is not restricted to an exportation to foreign countries, but may mean a

carrying out of the Port The Stroud Judicial Dictionary, Vo. II 1903 defines the

term exportation referring to the decision in A.G. v Pougett 2 Price, 381, as

follows:

unless a vessel has proceeded out of the limits of the Port with her cargo, it is not such an Exportation of the goods as will protect the cargo from duties subsequently imposed on the Exportation of goods of the same nature;although the vessel is not only freighted and afoat but has gone through all the formalities of Clearance, & at the Custom House and has paid the Exportation Dues.

[206] In A.G. v Pougett (supra), the question was whether the goods laden on

board the ship, having broken ground in the Themes, and not having left the

port of London may be said to have been exported. It was held that the goods

shipped could not be considered as exported until the ship had cleared the

limits of the ports as follows:

It is significant to know that this action was decided under the Tyne Coal Dues Act 1872 and the Court held that There is nothing in the language of the Act (the Tyne Coal Dues Act 1872) to show that the word exported was used in any other than its ordinary sense, namely, carried out of the port ..We feel bound to hold that coals carried away from the port, not on a temporary excursion, as in a tug or pleasure boat, which intends to return with more or less of the coals on board, and which may be regarded as always constructively within the port, but taken away for the purpose of being wholly consumed beyond this limits of the port,

80

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

are coals exported within the meaning of the Act. (Muller v Baldwin (1874) L.R. 9 O.B 457, per cur., at p. 461).

[207] It is significant to note that A.G. v Pougett (supra) was not an income tax

or custom case, but a decision under the Tyne Coals Act, which has now been

abolished. There was clear evidence in that case that the coals had been taken

away for the purpose of being wholly consumed beyond the limits of the port

and thus, the coals were held to be exported

[208] In Stockton Ry v. Barrett, 8 E.R. 1225 (House of Lords), the action was for

money had and received, originally brought in the Court of Common Pleas, to

recover three sums of money, which the plaintiff there, Charles Barrett, alleged

had been unlawfully received by the defendants as tolls on the carriage of

certain coals carried on the line of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, of

which they were the proprietors.

[209] It was held that the words shipped for Exportation are not, necessarily,

restricted to an exportation to foreign countries, but may mean Exportation in

its evident sense, i.e. a carrying out of Port, and thus, include carrying

commodities from one port to another, within the Kingdom and that the words

"the port of Stockton-upon-Tees aforesaid," meant the whole port of that name,

and was not restricted to the port of the town of Stockton-upon-Tees;

[210] That action was, however, decided under the Railway Act, which

empowered the proprietors to levy on all coals carried along any part of their

line, such sum as they should direct, " not exceeding the sum of 4d. per ton per

mile." It then went on thus: " And for all coal, which shall be shipped on board

any vessel, etc. in the port of Stockton-upon-Tees aforesaid, for the purpose of

exportation, such sum as the said proprietors shall appoint, not exceeding the

sum of one-halfpenny per ton per mile: "

[211] As noted, the cases relied on by the Appellant relate to the statutory

interpretation given to the term exportation in different statutes, which are

unrelated to tax statutes, and such decisions cannot, in my view, be used to

determine the question as to whether the supply of bunker fuel to a ship for its

navigation or use during its voyage constitutes an export for the purpose of

the concessionary tax rates in the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006.

[212] The Appellant, however, relied on the Imports and Exports (Control) Act,

No. 1 of 1969, and the Customs Ordinance in support of its position that the

supply of bunker fuel constitutes an export having regard to the definition of

81

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

the term export in the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, No. 1 of 1969. For

this aspect of the case, it is appropriate to take note of Section 22 of the Imports

and Exports (Control) Act, no. 1 of 1969, which provides for levy of tax. The term

export is defined in Section 22 of the Imporst & Exports (Control) Act, 1969 as

follows:

export with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions when used in relation to any goods, means the carrying and taking out of Sri Lanka, or causing to be carried or taken out of Sri Lanka, whether by sea or by air of such goods

[213] Accordingly, the statutory definition of the term export refers to the

actual carrying and taking out of Sri Lanka or causing to be carried out of Sri

Lanka of the goods in question by sea or by air of such goods. The learned

counsel for the Appellant relied heavily on the definition of "export" in Section

22 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act and it was argued that since the

definition does not refer to the requirement of destination, the same applies

to the concessionary tax rate under the Inland Revenue Act. On this basis the

Appellant argues that the Imports and Exports (Contriol) Act, No. 1 of 1969

would indicate the statutory criteria applicable for determining whether or not

a person is an exporter for the purpose of the Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006.

[214] The question that arises for determination is whether the definition of the

term export in the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, is the determinative

factor in deciding that the bunker fuel had been exported within the meaning

of Sections 42 or Section 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006.

Customs Ordinance

[215] The Appellant further argues that the concept of export defined in

Section 22 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act is further confirmed by

Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance, which indicates the point of time when

an export is deemed to have taken place and an exportation of any goods is

made and completed shall be deemed to have had effect when the goods had

been shipped on board the ship in which they had been exported. Section 16

of the Customs Ordinance provides s follows:

If upon the first levying or repealing of any duty, or upon the first permitting or prohibiting of any importation or exportation whether inwards, outwards, or coastwise in Sri Lanka, it shall - become necessary to

82

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

determine the precise time at which an importation or exportation of any goods made and completed shall be deemed to have had effect, such time, in respect of importation, shall be deemed to be the time at which the ship importing such goods had actually come within the limits of the port at which such ship shall in due course be reported and such goods be discharged; and such time, in respect of exportation, shall be deemed to be the time at which the goods had been shipped on board the ship in which they had been exported; and if such question shall arise upon the arrival or departure of any ship, in respect of any charge or allowance upon such ship, exclusive' of any cargo, the time of such arrival shall be deemed to be the time at which the report of such ship shall have been or ought to have been made; and the time of such departure shall be deemed to be the time of the last clearance of such ship with the Director-General for the voyage upon which she had departed.

[216] That means that an importation starts from one point and ends at

another. It starts when the goods cross the customs barrier in a foreign country

(exporting country) and ends when they cross the limits of the port in Sri Lanka

(importing Country). In the case of exportation, the time of exportation under

section 16 shall be deemed to be the time at which the goods had been shipped

on board the ship, in which the goods had been exported, and it starts when

the goods cross the customs limits of the port of one country (exporting

country) and delivered to the ship on board in which such goods are exported

to another country (importing country).

[217] In terms of this Section, the precise time at which exportation of any goods

shall be deemed to be the time at which the goods had been shipped on board

the ship in which they had been exported. Accordingly, the Appellant argues

that the statutory criteria applicable for determining whether or not a person is

an exporter, the destination is not a requirement to be fulfilled under the law of

Sri Lanka.

[218] The argument of the Appellant is that Section 22 of the Imports and

Exports (Control) Act read with Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance refers to

goods being taken out of the country rather than the goods necessarily being

delivered to another country. Accordingly, it was argued on behalf of the

Appellant referring to Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance that as the time of

the export of goods occurs when the goods have been put on the ship, which

constitutes an export notwithsndaning the fact that the ship is within Sri Lankan

territorial waters at the time of the delivery of the bunker fuel. He further argued

that the consumption, utilization or sale of the bunker fuel occurs once the

83

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

vessel leaves the Colombo Port into the international waters and thus, the

goods are taken out of the country.

[219] On the other hand, Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance applies to the

definition of time of importation or exportation of prohibited or restricted

goods and goods illegally imported for the purpose of levying or repealing of

any duty under the Customs Ordinance. This Section has to be read with

Section 3 of the Protection of Government Revenue (Special provisions) Act, No.

1 of 2006, according to which the date of importation or exportation ...shall be

the date of delivery to the Director General of Customs of the bill of entry.

Section 3 of the Protection of Government Revenue (Special provisions) Act

reads as follows:

3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any of the laws specified in Part II of the Schedule hereto, for the purpose of levying or charging any tax, duty, surcharge, levy or other charge on the importation or exportation of goods into or from Sri Lanka, the date of importation or exportation, as the case may be, shall be the date of delivery to the Director-General of Customs, of the bill of entry relating to the goods on which such tax, duty, surcharge, levy or other charge is levied or charged.

[220] The Schedule includes, inter alia, the Customs Ordinance (Cap. 235), as

last amended by Act, No. 2 of 2003. For the purpose of levying or charging any

tax, duty, surcharge, levy or other charge on the importation or exportation of

goods into or from Sri Lanka, the date of importation or exportation, as the case

may be, under the Protection of Government Revenue (Special provisions) Act

shall be the date of delivery to the Director-General of Customs, of the bill of

entry relating to the goods on which such tax, duty, surcharge, levy or other

charge is levied or charged.

[221] As noted, for the purpose of the protection of government revenue and

prevention of any loss of revenue to the Government, the date of importation

or exportation of goods, the date of delivery is relevant to the levying or

charging any tax, duty, surcharge, levy or other charge under the Customs

Ordinance. Those principles are, however, not applicable to the interpretation

of the term export under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10

of 2006.

[222] Accordingly, for the purpose of levying or repealing of any customs duty

upon the first permitting or prohibiting of any importation or exportation of

84

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

prohibited/restricted goods and goods illegally imported, the time of

importation shall be the time at which the ship importing such goods had

actually come within the limits of the port at which such ship shall be reported

and such goods be discharged. In case of exportation of prohibited/restricted

goods and goods illegally exported, the time of exportation shall be the time at

which the goods had been shipped on board the ship.

[223] To constitute an export under Section 22 of the Imports and Exports

(Control) Act, the goods must be either taken out of the territory of Sri Lanka or

caused to be taken out of Sri Lanka, by sea or air of such goods. This means

that the mere delivery of the bunker fuel into the tanks of the ship is insufficient

to constitute an export unless such fuel had been either actually taken out of

Sri Lanka or caused to be taken out of Sri Lanka on a ship bound for a place out

of Sri Lanka.

[224] The Imports and Exports (Control) Act is intended to provide for the

control of the importation and exportation of goods and regulation of the

standards of exportable goods. The provisions of the Imports and Exports

(Control) Act shall be, however, read and construed with the Customs

Ordinance as set out in Section 21 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act. In

terms of Section 21 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, the provisions of

the Act shall be construed with the Customs Ordinance and for the purpose of

the application of the Customs Ordinance-

(a). goods the importation of which is prohibited by this Act or by regulation made under this Act shall be deemed to be goods the importation of which is prohibited by that Ordinance;

(b) goods the exportation of which is prohibited by this Act or by regulation made under this Act shall be deemed to be goods the exportation of which is prohibited by that Ordinance;

(c) goods the importation of which is restricted by this Act or by regulation made under this Act shall be deemed to be goods the importation of which is restricted by that Ordinance;

(d) goods the exportation of which is restricted by this Act or by regulation made under this Act shall be deemed to be goods the exportation of which is restricted by that Ordinance.

[225] As noted, Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance, which applies to the

definition of time of importation or exportation for prohibited or restricted

85

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

goods and goods illegally imported for the purpose of levying or repealing of

any duty under the Customs Ordinance and thus, it cannot be strictly applied

for the purpose of interpreting the term export and levying income tax under

the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended).

[226] The provisions of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act shall be read and

construed with the Customs Ordinance and thus, the goods either prohibited

or restricted by the provisions of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act shall be

deemed to be the goods prohibited or restricted by the Customs Ordinance. In

the result, the definition of export in section 22 of the Imports and Exports

(Control) Act cannot be strictly applied to the interpretation of the term export

for the concessionary tax rate under Sections 42 and 52 of the Inland Revenue

Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended).

Customs Clearance

[227] The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Appellant has a special customs entry (bill of entry) passed when it issued marine bunker fuel to foreign ships which are paid in foreign currency and such custom clearance and payment made in foreign currency shall be regarded as evidence that the supply of bunker fuel was an export transaction outside Sri Lanka in terms of the provisions of the Protection of Government Revenue (Special Provisions) Act No. 1 of 2006. The Appellant also relies on the Indian decision in CIT v .Silver and Arts Palace (2003) 259 ITR 684 to argue that the customs clearance is evidence that characterises the transaction as an export. It is the position of the Appellant that once the goods are kept in the customs clearance station, then, the goods shall be deemed to have been in the export stream.

[228] The said case related to the refusal of the deduction claimed by the assessee under Section 80HHC of The Income- Tax Act, 1995 placing reliance on Explanation (aa) to Section 80HHC(4A) of the Act. The said Section provides that "'export out of India' shall not include any transaction by way of sale or otherwise, in a shop, emporium or any other establishment situate in India, not involving clearance at any customs station as defined in the Customs Act, 1962 (52 of 1962)." There was no dispute in that case that transactions of counter sales effected by the respondent involved customs clearance within the meaning of Explanation (aa) to Section 80HHC (4A) of the Act, and further that the sales were in convertible foreign exchange.

[229] If the above interpretation applies to the export in question as projected by Dr. Felix in the written submissions filed on behalf of the Appellant, then, it would mean that irrespective of the condition in Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland

86

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

Revenue Act, the delivery of goods shall be after customs clearance, i.e., after the goods have cleared all local customs and all other legal formalities and are kept ready for delivery to the ships tanks, the Appellant would qualify for the concessionary tax rates specified in the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act.

[230] In my opinion, the concept sought to put in service in CIT v. Silver and Arts Palace (supra) cannot be applied to the facts of this case and therefore, the submission of customs clearance (bill of entry) per se does not constitute an Appellant an exporter of the bunker fuel under sections 42 of 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended).

Use of Foreign Currency

[231] The learned Counsel for the Appellant citing the Exchange Control Act,

No. 24 of 1953, as amended, submitted that the fact that the Appellant is

permitted by the Central Bank to accept foreign currency payments for supplies

of marine bunker fuel to ships travelling in international waters supports the

position of the Appellant that the sales undertaken by the Appellant are not

local sales but are in fact exports. He submitted that it is an offence to accept

foreign currency for a local sale and therefore, this transaction should be

construed to be an export.

[232] On the other hand, the Central Bank has powers to permit any person

under Section 7 of the Exchange Control Act, to make any payment to, or for

the credit of a person resident outside Sri Lanka or make any payment to or for

the credit of a person resident in Sri Lanka. In my view the mere fact that the

sale of bunker fuel was paid for in foreign currency does not necessarily render

it an export within the meaning of Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act.

Licence under the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act, No. 28 of 1961

[233] The Appellant argues that the Appellant possesses a licence under Section

5B of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act, No. 28 of 1961 to import, export,

sell, supply or distribute marine gas, oil and furnace oil (Vide- paragraph 43 of

the written submissions tendered on behalf of the Appellant on 18.10.2019). In

my view, the licence granted by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation under

Section 5B of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act, No. 28 of 1961 does not

necessarily mean that the supply of bunker fuel shall be treated as an export

within the meaning of Sections Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act.

Central Bank Annual Reports

87

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[234] The Appellant relies heavily on the Annual Reports of the Central Bank for

the year 2011 in table 3.4 on page 63, which, the Appellant claims distinguishes

between exports and local sales and table 3.4 which lists the Appellant as a

source for both imports and export data. The Appellant submits that the Report

supports his contention that the supply of bunker fuel has been recognised as

an export by the Central Bank. In my view, the table 3.4 does not support the

contention that the it distinguishes between exports and local sales or that the

Central Bank has recognised the Appellant as an exporter within the meaning

of any statute as claimed by the Appellant.

[235] The document (R1) issued by the Central Bank stated that for statistical

compilation and economic analysis, bunker fuel and marine fuel selling to

foreign ships and aircraft is an export following internationally accepted

practices for economic data compilation. It, however, states that this

classification is not used for any other purpose as the classification is not made

in terms of any law or for the purpose of any law. Accordingly, this document

does not help the Appellant.

[236] The Appellant relies on the New Zeeland Court of Appeal case in

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. International Importing Limited (1972)

NZLR 1095 in support its position that the word export is complete when (i)

taking the goods out of the country and (ii) sending them or causing them to

be sent out. The question in the said case was whether, for the purposes of

Section 129B of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954, the goods sold by a "duty

free shop operated by respondent company, to travellers departing overseas,

and the subsequent carriage of those goods beyond New Zealand by the

purchasers, constituted the "export of those goods by the company, entitling

it to the deduction given for income tax purposes by s 129B. Section129B of

the said Act reads as follows:

"Export goods means goods exported from New Zealand by a taxpayer, being goods (a) Which were sold or disposed of by the taxpayer; and (b) Of which the taxpayer was the owner at the time of the sale or disposal but does not include

(c) Goods exported by way of gift: (d) Goods taken or sent out of New Zealand with the intention that they will

at some later time be brought or sent back to New Zealand:

88

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

(e) Goods imported into New Zealand and subsequently exported from New Zealand after being processed, packed, graded, or sorted in New Zealand or incorporated with another product in New Zealand, if the consideration receivable for the sale or disposal of the goods so exported is less than fifteen percent greater than the cost of all imported goods included in the goods so exported, such cost being the landed cost of those imported goods (exclusive of New Zealand customs duty) at the time when they were imported into New Zealand: (f) Goods imported into New Zealand and subsequently exported from New

Zealand in the same form without processing, packing, grading, or sorting thereof in New Zealand: (g) Goods exported to the Cook Islands (including Niue) or to the Tokelau Islands: (h) Animals, animal products and by-products (including dairy produce, meat, meat products, wool, and their respective by-products), newsprint, and minerals: Provided that the Governor-General may from time to time, by Order in Council, exclude any such goods or any specified class or classes of such

goods from the operation of this paragraph: (i) Any other goods specified by the Governor-General from time to time by Order in Council:

[237] The vital question in that case was whether goods which were sold by the respondent (and of which it was admittedly the owner at the time of such sales) were exported from New Zealand by the respondent within the opening words of the foregoing definition. The finding of the Commissioner was challenged on one question only, namely his finding that the goods sold to departing travellers in the respondent's duty free shops were exported by the respondent.

[238] The transactions were sales of goods of which respondent was the owner at the time of sale. The goods were taken out of the country as a direct result of the sale, and as one intended by both vendor and purchaser. And these were sales and the immediate result of which was an increase in foreign currency reserves, and (1) taking the goods out of the country, and (2) sending them or causing them to be sent outthe choice between them depends on the answer to the question: What operation is it that the Section is obviously designed to subsidise? Turner J, at pp 1097 stated:

89

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

The section contains no definition of "export nor can it be contended that this word is a term of art. It must therefore be given its ordinary meaning, or perhaps I should say one of its ordinary meanings, to be selected according to context. Clearly, if it is given one of its ordinary meanings the travellers may be said to have "exported the goods themselves, for they carried them (if small enough) on to the plane personally, keeping them in their possession while the plane flew out of New Zealand. And no different result follows in the case of the larger packages which were put into the plane's hold, of which the passenger-purchasers doubtless must be deemed to have had possession at the time when they were taken out of the country. But should the word "export so be read, as referring to what these people did, if proper regard is had to the context in which that word is found in s 129B, and if the acknowledged purpose of that section is remembered? The legislation is plainly addressed to those persons, and to those alone, who increase the foreign exchange reserves of New Zealand, by sending goods abroad, or causing them to be sent abroad, receiving in return foreign exchange for which they are bound to account, and do account, to the Reserve Bank. It is clear that even if the travellers may be regarded as themselves "exporting the goods, the word "export where used in the section must also clearly be applicable to those, such as respondent company, who send the goods abroad, or cause them to be sent, with this result. Surely a dairy company "exports butter, and a fruit cannery "exports its manufactures, whether it ships the goods to its own order in another country, or sells here f.o.b. to a foreign person or corporation, provided simply that the transaction is one in which it causes goods to be sent abroad in exchange for foreign currency which it receives and for which it accounts. t is to be observed however that s 129B is solely concerned with the actions of vendors. In our opinion a vendor may export either by taking or by sending. There will be many cases where it can be said that the buyer exports by taking, as for example in the case of an ordinary contract.

[239] Thus, Turner J., stated that the question whether the respondent or the

passengers, who is to be regarded, for the purposes of s 129B, as having "exported the goods which it sold to the travellers. Referring to the meanings of the word (1) taking the goods out of the country, and (2) sending them or causing them to be sent outthe choice between them depends on the answer to the question: What operation was it that the section is obviously designed to subsidise? On this approach to the matter, it seemed clear to to Turner J. that it is respondent's operation which was meant to receive the reward offered by the statute.

90

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[240] The facts of the New Zeeland judgment and the legal principles discussed under Section 129B of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 are completely different in the present case for the following reasons:

1. The Respondent in that case owned and operated a duty free shop at the

"Christchurch International Duty Free Shops and the passengers were allowed to purchase goods from a duty free shop situated in the departure lounge of the airport to be taken out of New Zeeland. The question that was decided was whether or not it was the respondent or

the passengers who is to be regarded, for the purposes of s 129B, as having "exported the goods which it sold to the travellers. In the present case, the issue was whether or not the supplier of bunker fuel to a ship constitutes an export for the purpose of the concessionary tax rates under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act.

2. The New Zeeland Act provides that to constitute an export goods, the

goods exported by a taxpayer from New Zeeland shall be goods exported which were sold or disposed of by the taxpayer; and of which the taxpayer

was the owner at the time of the sale or disposal. Section 129B of the New Zeeland Act is not so worded as to require the taxpayer to be the owner of the goods at the time of export. The Section only requires that he should be the owner of the goods at the time of sale. There is no similar requirement in the Inland Revenue Act of Sri Lanka.

3. The New Zeeland decision is also based on the operation mode of the

taxpayer as the owner of the goods. In order to purchase the goods from the duty free shop, the customer has to produce his boarding pass to the aircraft and his flight number of the duty free shop owned by the

respondent The goods, in the open bags were handed to the passenger at the call to board the aircraft by the employees of the respondent on production of their copy of the sales docket in the "clear area at the airport and in the presence of Customs Officers. There is no such conditions to be fulfilled for the charging of income tax under the Inland Revenue Act.

4. As a matter of fact and degree, the whole nature of the respondent's

specialised business and the circumstances under which it is conducted, taken together with the actual part played by the respondent in bringing

about the removal from New Zealand of goods sold by it to departing

91

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

passengers, proved that the respondent exported the goods in question by sending them out of New Zealand. There, the duty free sale occurred inside the departure lounge of the airport after the passengers were cleared for immigration and already stamped as having left the country by the customs officer that was strong evidence to establish that the passengers had already left the country. In the circumstances, the Court treated the goods to be export goods within the meaning of section 129B of the New Zeeland Act.

[241] Under such circumstances, the Court came to the conclusion that the whole nature of the respondent's specialised business and the circumstances under which it is conducted, taken together with the actual part played by the respondent in bringing about the removal from New Zealand of goods sold by it to departing passengers, justify the view that the respondent exported the goods by sending them out of New Zeeland. In my view the New Zealand case will not support the stand taken by the Appellant in the instant case, and it cannot be regarded as a precedent for the case in hand.

[242] The Canadian case of R v.Wuulf (1970) 1 CCC (2d) 281 relied on by the

Appellant is a criminal case for attempting to export out of Canada to the USA

silver coins of Canada without a permit and the issue arose about the definition

of the word export under the statute. It was held that the word export was

simply take outside of Canada. The definition of the term export for the

purpose of criminal liability of attempting to export goods under a criminal

statute cannot be used to define the term export for the purpose of defining

the term export under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act.

[243] In R. v. Smith (Donald) (1973) Q.B. 924, the defendant was charged with

being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition against

the importation of cannabis imposed by the Dangerous Drugs Act 1965 ,

contrary to Section 304 (b) of the Customs and Excise Act 1952, and with being

knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition against the

exportation of cannabis imposed by the Act of 1965, contrary to Section 56 (2)

of the Act of 1952.

[244] In that case, packets containing cannabis addressed to a person in

Bermuda were put on board an aircraft in Kenya, which was bound for Heathrow

Airport in the United Kingdom. At Heathrow, the packets were unloaded and

without leaving the customs area were put on board a second aircraft bound

for Bermuda. The cannabis was discovered when the packets arrived in

92

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

Bermuda. The question was whether the prohibited goods retained within the

customs area were imported into the United Kingdom. It was held that although

the cannabis had merely been transferred from one aircraft to another, the

cannabis had been imported into the country when the aircraft from Kenya

landed at Heathrow and had been exported when placed on board the aircraft

bound for Bermuda (post, p. 935G-H).

[245] In A.G. v. Kumarasinghe (1995) 2 Sri LR. 1, the accused, a Sri Lankan

passport holder was indicted for having imported into Sri Lanka, 40 pieces of

Gold valued at Rs. 2 million without a valid permit issued by the Central Bank.

After arriving in Sri Lanka on an Air Lanka flight, he had been in the Transit

Lounge with the pieces of gold to proceed to Male. The High Court of Negombo

acquitted the accused. Referring to R. Smith (supra), it was held that (i)

Importation is not defined in the Exchange Control Act, but recourse could be

had to Section 22 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act 1 of 1969; and (ii)

the moment the accused-respondent landed in Sri Lankan soil with gold, the

act of importation was complete, if he failed to produce the requisite permit

for possession of that gold. Accordingly, it was held that he has contravened

the provisions of Section 21(1).

[246] In all three criminal cases, the accused was considered to be an exporter

on the basis that he was himself involved physically importing prohibited goods

into a foreign country without a permit in violation of a criminal statute either

under the Customs Act or Imports and Exports Act. Here, the issue is whether

or not the supply of the bunker fuel to a ship that visits a port of Sri Lanka can

constitute an export for the purpose of concessionary tax rates under Sections

42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act.

[247] The other argument of the Appellant was that as the consumption of

bunker fuel occurs mid-voyage in international waters of another country, the

question of Bill of Lading or Insurance Contract does not arise and thus, the

mere fact that the goods do not arise at a foreign port does not preclude the

goods from being considered an export. The argument of the Appellant was

that the mere supply of bunker fuel to a foreign ship and utilization of such

bunker fuel in the international waters constitutes an export within the meaning

of Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act. Although the argument is

attractive, I am afraid that I do not find any merit in the same.

[248] The charging provision in Section 3 is the prime purpose of the Inland

Revenue Act and it shall control the profits and income that are chargeable with

93

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

income tax subject to the provisions of the said Act. As noted, the charging

Section is not controlled by the measure of tax levied under the provisions of

the Imports and Exports (Contriol) Act or the Customs Ordinance. The relevant

statutory provisions with regard to levy of customs duties are found in the

Customs Ordinance and the relevant statutory provisions with regard to the

imposition of income tax are found in the Inland Revenue Act.

[249] The principles of charging the income tax and the principles of charging

the customs duty are distinct, different and independent of each other. The

income tax is charged on profits or income of a person which falls within the

scope of Section 2 of the Inland Revenue Act and the rate of income tax varies

subject to the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act. Customs Duty is a tax

imposed on imports and exports of goods under the Customs Ordinance when

they are transported across international borders and the rate of Customs duty

varies subject to the provisions of the Customs Ordinance.

[250] When the provisions of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act are read and

construed with the Customs Ordinance, the goods either prohibited or

restricted by the provisions of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act shall be

deemed to be the goods prohibited or restricted by the Customs Ordinance.

The Customs Ordinance takes care of levy of import of goods or export of

goods and thus, the taxable event for levy of custom duty and entry tax are

different and distinct. The "pith and substance" and "aspect" of customs levy,

as regards both imports and exports in terms of restrictions, prohibition and

permissibility are different and distinct from the charging of income tax under

the Inland Reveue Act.

[251] Mr. De Silva submitted that the definition of "export" as defined in Section

22 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act does not include "place of

destination but only Taking out of Sri Lanka or causing to be carried or taken

out of Sri Lanka and, therefore, the concept of destination on the supply of

bunker fuel to a ship is clearly beyond the ambit of Inland Revenue Act. In my

view, Section 22 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act or the Customs

Ordinance has no overriding effect over the provisions of the Inland Revenue

Act and the imposition of income tax under the provisions of the said Acts are

based on different principles and the fulfilment of different conditions.

[252] If the Legislature intended to apply the same term export for the

purpose of Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, the Legislature could

have easily used the same meaning as defined in Section 22 of the Imports and

94

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

Exports (Control) Act, No. 1 of 1969. Thus, the argument of the Appellant that

since the place of destination is not specifically mentioned in the definition of

"export" in Section 22 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, it will give rise

to the inference that Legislature intended not make the concept of destination

as a requirement of export for the purposes of Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland

Revenue Act is without substance.

[253] This case is not concerned about the imposition of levy under the Imports

and Exports (Control) Act or the Customs Ordinance, and we are dealing with

the imposition of income tax and the concessionary tax rates specified in the

Fifth Schedule to the said Act. This Court is not inclined to apply the principles

of the imposition of levy under the Imports and Exports (Control) Act or the

Customs Ordinance to a case of export under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland

Revenue Acts

[254] It is only from the language of the statute that the intention of the

Legislature must be gathered, for the Legislature means no more and no less

than what it says. It is not permissible for the court to speculate as to what the

Legislature must have intended and then to twist or bend the language of a

different statute (the Customs Ordinance and the Imports and Exports (Control)

Act to make it accord with the presumed intention of the Legislature (see-

Polestar Electronic (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Additional Commissioner, Sales Tax, 1978] 41

STC 409 (SC).

[255] Of course, equitable construction may be admissible in relation to other

statutes, but such an interpretation is not permitted to a charging or taxing

provision of a statute (see-Murarilal Mahabir Prasad v. B.R. Vad [1976] 37 STC

77 (SC), which has laid down the tax is altogether different from the recovery of

the tax/duty under the Imports and Exports (Control) Act and the Customs

Ordinance

UN Report

[256] The Appellant relied on the United Nations Department of Economic and

Social Affairs-International Merchandise Trade Statistics: Concept and

Definitions (IMTS 2010) to substantiate its position that that the supply of

bunker fuel to ships travelling in international waters constitutes an export.

Paragraph 1.32 on page 18 of the Report on Bunkers, stores, ballast and damage

reads as follows:

1.32. Bunkers, stores, ballast and damage that are supplied:

95

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

1. to foreign vessels or aircraft in the economic territory of the compiling

country;or 2. by national vessels or aircraft to foreign vessels or aircraft outside the

economic territory of the compiling country; or 3. are landed in foreign ports from national vessels or aircraft;

are in the scope of IMTS 2010 for exports.

[257] Paragraph 1.42 which relates to goods recommended for exclusion reads:

1.42. Goods simply being transported include goods under in transit or in transshipment customs procedures but are not limited to them. ... Irrespective of the customary procedure applied when goods cross the compiling countrys border, if it is known that their destination is a third country, the goods should be treated as simply being transported through the country and excluded. However, goods that are not under in transit or transshipment customs procedure and change ownership after entering the economic territory of a country should be recoded as imports and re-exports if they leave the country in the state as imported.... [258] Firstly, the publication contains guidelines or recommendations and

therefore, Sri Lanka is not obliged to adhere to them. Secondly, these guidelines

or recommendations cannot change the principles of income tax specified in the

Inland Revenue Act of Sri Lanka. Thirdly, the guidelines first classify the bunker

fuel supplied to foreign vessels within the economic territory as exports. They

also classify the bunker fuel supplied by national vessels to foreign vessels

outside the economic territory as exports. Thirdly, they classify the bunker fuel

supplied to vessels that are landed in foreign ports.

[259] It is my view, that the classification is based on the nationality of the vessel

which is not the basis on which the concept of export is decided in the Inland

Revenue Act of Sri Lanka. Fourthly, paragraph 1.42 states that when goods are

taken out of the territory of a country, the goods should be treated as simply

being transported to a third country where the destination of a foreign country

is known. It seems that the guidelines themselves, recognize that where the

destination is known, the goods may be said to have been transported to a

foreign country. For those reasons, I am of the view that the UN Report will not

support the contention of the Appellant in the present case.

[260] In my view the mere supply or stores of bunker fuel in the ships tanks for

consumption on board a ship cannot possibly be a deemed export, and such

consumption by a foreign going ship cannot ever be considered as a supply

96

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

occasioning the export of bunker fuel unless there is documentary evidence that

manifest an indication that the ship that is consuming bunker fuel for navigation

on the high seas is intended to a foreign destination point. Such documentary

evidence in my view would exclude the possibility that such goods are not meant

for supply of local consumption, which does not signify an export within the

meaning of Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act.

Destination Principle.

[261] If the present transaction of the Appellant involves goods being moved

from one jurisdiction to another, the destination principle applies and under the

destination principle, the element of export is satisfied when the foreign

destination point is intended and indicated in the relevant documents submitted

by the Appellant.

[262] The mere delivery of the bunker fuel outside the customs barrier to the

vessel cannot be regarded as having taken place out of the territory of Sri Lanka

to constitute an export unless goods are taken out of Sri Lanka to another

foreign point and the element of taking out of the territory of Sri Lanka to a

destination point of another country become an integral part of the transaction,

to constitute an export under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act. A

following illustrations given by Hidayatullah., J. In Burmah Shell Oil Storage and

Distributing Company case (supra) will explain this proposition vividly. Goods

cannot be said to be exported if they are ordered by the health authorities to be

destroyed by dumping them in the sea, and for that purpose are taken out of

the territories of India and beyond the territorial wastes and dumped in the open

sea (paragraph 36). Another illustration is where goods put on board a streamer

bound for a foreign country, but jettisoned can still be said to have been

exported, even though they do not reach their destination (supra).

[263] The objective of granting the concessionary tax rates under sections 42 or

52 of the Inland Revenue Act as regards the supply of bunker fuel to foreign

going ships for navigation is to attract foreign going ships to Sri Lankan ports

and promote bunkering industry. So that the foreign going ships will visit the

Ports of Sri Lanka and receive bunker fuel for navigation on the high seas in the

course of its journey to the next foreign destination Port and the suppliers will

be benefited from the concessionary tax rates under Section 42 or 52 of the

Inland Revenue Act.

97

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[264] The term 'export' in Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act signifies

etymologically 'to take out of Sri Lanka into the territory of another country, and

therefore, means to take out of Sri Lanka, goods to a territory of another country.

Now the term "export " for the purpose the taking bunker fuel out of Sri Lanka

means taking out of Sri Lanka to any place (destination point) in the high seas

outside the territorial waters of Sri Lanka. In this sense, any "place" beyond the

territorial waters of Sri Lanka would be a place outside the country. The test is

that the sending of the bunker fuel out of the country is satisfied when the

bunker fuel, which is directly delivered to the operator /owner of the foreign

going vessel for navigation on the high seas has a foreign destination point. The

resulting position is that the ownership of the bunker fuel will be transferred to

the owner/operator of the vessel by the supplier from a taxable activity and the

vessel will use those bunker fuels for navigation on the high seas intended for a

foreign destination point out of the Sri Lankan territorial waters (the next foreign

port). In short, to earn the exemption or concessionary tax rate, the goods must

have a foreign destination point where they can be said to be taken out of Sri

Lanka to constitute an export under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue

Act.

[265] At the hearing, the learned Additional Solicitor-General submitted that in

order for a transaction to qualify as export, there should be a recipient for such

goods in another jurisdiction as an importer and as there was no corresponding

importer in another country to physically receive the goods, the transition in the

present case does not constitute an export. Bunker fuel supplied to a foreign

going vessel for navigation occasions an export and eligible for the

concessionary tax rates under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act if it is

delivered by the supplier directly to a foreign going vessel and received by its

owner/operator for navigation on the high seas out of Sri Lanka, with evidence

of a foreign destination point.

[266] I do not think that given the nature of the goods being the bunker fuel,

which is supplied to the operator/owner of the ship for navigation on the high

seas for the next foreign destination point, the requirement in traditional export

of cargo where the goods are exported to a specified recipient in another foreign

jurisdiction is necessary to constitute an export under Sections 42 or 52 of the

Inland Revenue Act. The above-mentioned second illustration that goods put on

board a streamer bound for a foreign country, but jettisoned can still be said to

have been exported, even though they do not reach their destination vividly

explains this proposition in case of bunker fuel which is supplied for navigation.

98

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

Another illustration is where goods shipped from Colombo intended for delivery

in Bombay proceeded on a voyage, leaving the Sri Lankan territorial waters, but

developed engine trouble and returned and ran aground in the Sri Lankan

territorial waters at Hambantota Port. In this illustration, the ship intended to

deliver the goods at Bombay Port (destination point) and moved out of the Sri

Lankan territorial waters and the export was complete when the goods were

taken beyond the territorial waters of Sri Lanka with the intention of delivering

at Bombay Port. The fact that the ship was brought back to Sri Lanka did not

affect as the goods sold were intended to be taken to that foreign destination

point, namely, the Bombay Port.

[267] I hold that the concessionary tax rates under Sections 42 or 52 of the

Inland Revenue Act in the present case applies to the bunker fuel directly

supplied to the operator or owner of the foreign going vessel to be used for

navigation on the high seas (out of the territorial waters of Sri Lanka) and

intended to a destination point of another country. This finding is limited to this

case, and it shall not in any way be construed as an application to other goods

in respect of which concessionary tax rates are claimed under Sections 42 or 52

of the Inland Revenue Act.

[268] How can the Appellant satisfy that that the ship carrying bunker fuel for

navigation was taken out of the Sri Lankan territorial waters? It must be shown

that the supply of bunker fuel was delivered to the foreign going ships tanks by

the Appellant to be used for navigation on the high seas with a foreign

destination point of another country.

[269] To benefit from the concessionary tax rates under Section 42 or 52 of the

Inland Revenue Act, as regards the supply of bunker fuel, the Appellant is

required to satisfy the following documents:

1. Purchase orders for the receiver (customer) of the bunker fuel indicating

the name of the vessel, date of departure and next destination from Sri

Lanka;

2. Purchase order indicating written instructions for the receiver (customer)

to deliver the bunker fuel to the vessel;

3. Sales invoice to the receiver of bunker fuel;

4. Bunker delivery note endorsed by the Master/Chief Engineer/ such

responsible officer of the vessel; and

5. Evidence of payment from the receiver (customer).

99

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

[270] In the instant case, there is nothing to indicate that the bunker fuel supplied

by the Appellant to a ship was bound to a foreign destination point out of Sri

Lanka as there is no evidence whatsoever, indicating that the destination of the

ship was any foreign place outside Sri Lanka. A perusal of the letter dated

31,10,2012 (p. 41 of the TAC briefs) issued by the senior assessor to the

Managing Director of the Appellant reveals that the assessor wanted the

Appellant to furnish the proof of the following documents to the assessor in

relation to High surplus fuel oil, and marine gas and reasons for non recognition

of sales:

1. Purchase order;

2.Purchase invoice;

3.Purchase accounting entries;

4.Goods receive note;

[271] The only document available in the TAC brief is one purchase order

requesting the supplier (Pilot Stattions Pvt Ltd) to deliver goods to the Appellant

with the payment details. The purchase order only refers to the date, contact

persons, purchase order number, the names of the supplier and the person to

whom the goods are delivered with payment details. No Bunker Delivey Note,

Bunker Nomination purchase invoice, goods receive note are available in the

TAC brief in respect of a foreign going vessel. No evidence is available with

regard to the destination port or the name of the ship or the Vessel

Representative (Engineer) of the ship or the Bunkering Supplier to a particular

foreign going ship to indicate whether the bunker fuel is required for use outside

the territorial waters of Sri Lanka. .

[272] Accordingly, there is no evidence whatsoever, that the bunker fuel was

supplied by the Appellant for consumption to ships which will be taken out of

the Sri Lankan territorial waters and used for navigation on the high seas when

travelling to a foreign destination point of another port. Such a destination point

is conspicuously absent in the present case. The argument of the Appellant that

the moment the bunker fuel was taken out of the Sri Lankan territory, the export

was complete cannot be presumed and accepted in the absence of documentary

evidence indicating the next foreign destination.

[273] For those reasons enumerated in this judgment, I hold that the supply of

bunker fuel by the Appellant in the present case, does not constitute an export

within the meaning of Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, and therefore,

100

CA TAX 0004 2018 TAC/IT/008/2015

the Appellant is not entitled to claim the concessionary tax rate under sections
