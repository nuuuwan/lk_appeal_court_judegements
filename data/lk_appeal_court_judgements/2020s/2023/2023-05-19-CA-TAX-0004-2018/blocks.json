I do agree with the view of the State Counsel. Hearing no doubt commences from the date of oral hearing. I would as such answer this question in favour of the Respondent and endorse the view of the Board of Review. It is not time barred as the Board arrived at the determination within 2 years. [Emphasis added]. [17] For those reasons, His Lordship Gooneratne J. having considered the question involved (Question No. 2), held with the Respondent on the basis that the hearing for the calculation of time limit of 2 years specified in section 140 (10) commences from the date of the oral hearing and not from the date of filing of the petition of appeal. I have no reason to deviate from the view taken by Gooneratne, J. in Mohideen v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra). I hold that when the legislation provides that when the Commission shall hear all appeals received by it and make its determination, within two hundred and seventy days of the time of the commencement of the hearing of the appeal [(prior to the Tax Appeal Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013)], the hearing commences from the date of oral hearing.",

This is precluded by the definition. Delegation often involves the granting of discretionary authority to another, but such authority is purely derivative.

To make the example of the present case, no doubt there have been thousands of requisitions in this country by individual ministries. It cannot be supposed that this regulation meant that in each case, the minister in person should direct his mind to the matter. The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers given to ministers are normally exercised under the authority of the ministers by responsible officials of the department. Public business could not be carried on if that were not the case. Constitutionally, the decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister. The minister is responsible. It is he who must answer before Parliament for anything that his officials have done under his authority, and, if for an important matter he selected an official of such junior standing that he could not be expected competently to perform the work, the minister would have to answer for that in Parliament. The whole system of departmental organisation and administration is based on the view that ministers, being responsible to Parliament, will see that important duties are committed to experienced officials. If they do not do that, Parliament is the place where complaint must be made against them\".[Emphasis added].",

Even if one transposes the words and communicate to such persons in writing the reasons for not accepting the return to the first line of the section after the word return and before the word estimate it will not make it a condition precedent. One has still to read more words into it to have the effect of postponing the rest of the exercise to sometime later. This would be doing violence to the section. The section imposes a duty, but does not impose a time limit within which it should be done. To my mind the section merely states that if the Assessor does not accept a return, he may assess on an estimate. His exercise is not complete till he has also communicated his reasons for not accepting the return. In effect he also justifies his act of assessing on an estimate. The plain meaning of the section is clear. (Emphasis added)",

    "text": "A duty is now imposed on the Assessor not only to give reasons for non-acceptance of a return, but also to communicate them to the assessor. The primary purpose of the amending legislation is to ensure that the Assessor will bring his mind to bear on the return and come to a definite determination whether or not to accept it. It was intended to prevent arbitrary and grossly unfair assessments which many Assessors had been making as a protective measure. An unfortunate practice had developed where some Assessors, due to pressure of work and other reasons, tended to delay looking at a return till the last moment and then without a proper scrutiny of the return, made a grossly exaggerated assessment. The law, I think, enabled the department to make recoveries pending any appeal on such assessments. The overall effect of this unhappy practice was to pressurize the taxpayer to such an extent that he was placed virtually at the mercy of the tax authorities. The new law was a measure intended to do away with this practice. Under the amendment when an Assessor does not accept a return, it must mean that at the relevant point of time he has brought his mind to bear on the return and has come to a decision rejecting the return. Consequent to this rejection, the reasons must be communicated to the assessee. The provisions for the giving of reasons and the written communication of the reasons, contained in the amendment is to ensure that in fact the new procedure would be followed. More particularly, the communication of the reason at the relevant time is the indication of its compliance. The new procedure would also have the effect of fixing the Assessor to a definite position and not give him the latitude to chop and change thereafter. It was therefore essential that an Assessor who rejects a return should state his reasons and communicate them h. His reasons must be communicated at or about the time he sends his assessment on an estimated income. Any later communication would defeat the remedial action intended by the amendment (emphasis added). [82] The Appellants argument is that the substance of the statement made by Samarakoon C.J. is that a duty is now imposed on the Assessor who rejects the return and makes an assessment to state reasons for such rejection, communicate the same to the taxpayer, issue and serve the notice of assessment before the expiration of the period for the making of the assessment.

This was why it had been argued in CA Tax 17/2017 that no lawfully valid assessment can be made without first serving a valid notice of assessment. The Division of this Court in C.A. Tax 17/2017 though that this is a practical impossibility. A letter cannot be sent without being written. But what was meant is not this. The argument of the appellant is that an assessment becomes valid only when the notice is given. This position was the basis of Ismail despite those two cases were concurred with the duty to give reasons. The position of the appellant is that an assessment is no assessment until notice of assessment is given. The position could have been otherwise, viz. an assessment could have been a valid assessment, as soon as an estimate is made. If like in Honig (administrators of Emmanuel Honig) v Sarasfield (H.M. Inspector of Taxes), the Commissioners Inland Revenue also maintained a register in which an assessment is entered. In the absence of such procedure in this country. It cannot be accepted that the making of an assessment without giving notice of assessment is a valid assessment. Hence, notice of assessment must be given to make the assessment validly made for the purpose of the stipulated time period.",

The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra), the assessor was required to make the assessment for the year of assessment 2007/2008 on or before 30.09.2009 in terms of section 163(5) (a) of the principal Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006. While the said period was still in operation, the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 19 of 2009 was enacted by parliament and it was certified by the Speaker on 31.03.2009, but it came into force on 01.04.2009. By the amending Act, the time period given to the asseesee to file a return was extended by two months and the time period given to the assessor to make the assessment was extended by six months (till 31.03.2011). The assessor made the assessment for the year of assessment 2007/2008 on 09.03.2010 and it was served on the assessee on 26.03.2010. The assessor made the assessment on the basis that the amending Act extended the time period given to the assessor to make the assessment for the year of assessment 2007/2008 by another 6 months, i.e. from 30.09.2009 to 31.03.2010.",

However, the position in law would be different in the matters which relate to procedural law but so far as substantive rights of parties are concerned they remain unaffected by the amendment in the enactment. We are, therefore, of the view that where a repeal of provisions of an enactment is followed by fresh legislation by an amending Act, such legislation is prospective in operation and does not affect substantive or vested rights of the parties unless made retrospective either expressly or by necessary intendment. We are further of the view that there is a presumption against the retrospective operation of a statute and further a statute is not to be construed to have a greater retrospective operation than its language renders necessary, but an amending Act which affects the procedure is presumed to be retrospective, unless amending Act provides otherwise (emphasis added).",

'The length and detail of modern legislation, wrote Lord Evershed M.R., 'has undoubtedly reinforced the claim of literal construction as the only safe rule.' If there is nothing to modify, alter or qualify the language which the statute contains, it must be construed in the ordinary and natural meaning of the words and sentences. The safer and more correct course of dealing with a question of construction is to take the words themselves and arrive if possible at their meaning without, in the first instance, reference to cases.",

    "text": "The section contains no definition of \"export nor can it be contended that this word is a term of art. It must therefore be given its ordinary meaning, or perhaps I should say one of its ordinary meanings, to be selected according to context. Clearly, if it is given one of its ordinary meanings the travellers may be said to have \"exported the goods themselves, for they carried them (if small enough) on to the plane personally, keeping them in their possession while the plane flew out of New Zealand. And no different result follows in the case of the larger packages which were put into the plane's hold, of which the passenger-purchasers doubtless must be deemed to have had possession at the time when they were taken out of the country. But should the word \"export so be read, as referring to what these people did, if proper regard is had to the context in which that word is found in s 129B, and if the acknowledged purpose of that section is remembered? The legislation is plainly addressed to those persons, and to those alone, who increase the foreign exchange reserves of New Zealand, by sending goods abroad, or causing them to be sent abroad, receiving in return foreign exchange for which they are bound to account, and do account, to the Reserve Bank. It is clear that even if the travellers may be regarded as themselves \"exporting the goods, the word \"export where used in the section must also clearly be applicable to those, such as respondent company, who send the goods abroad, or cause them to be sent, with this result. Surely a dairy company \"exports butter, and a fruit cannery \"exports its manufactures, whether it ships the goods to its own order in another country, or sells here f.o.b. to a foreign person or corporation, provided simply that the transaction is one in which it causes goods to be sent abroad in exchange for foreign currency which it receives and for which it accounts. t is to be observed however that s 129B is solely concerned with the actions of vendors. In our opinion a vendor may export either by taking or by sending. There will be many cases where it can be said that the buyer exports by taking, as for example in the case of an ordinary contract.",
