Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the claimant-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the appellant) on being aggrieved by the judgement pronounced by the learned

High Court Judge of Ampara on 09-03-2021, wherein the Revision Application

preferred by him challenging the Order dated 16-01-2019 by the learned

Magistrate of Ampara had been dismissed.

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant intimated to

the Court that he is not contesting the facts of the matter, but making

submissions purely on two questions of law, Namely;

1. Whether the confiscated item comes within a meaning of a vehicle or

not.

2. Was the interpretation given by the learned High Court Judge in that

regard correct.

Accordingly, this Court heard the submission of the learned Counsel for the

appellant as well as the submission of the learned State Counsel. This Court also

had the opportunity of scrutinizing the written submissions tendered by the

appellant in determining this appeal.

Facts that led to the confiscation of the vehicle bearing registration number EP

ZA-5559 by the learned Magistrate of Ampara are, briefly as follows.

On 27th August 2017, the Officer-in-Charge of Damana police station reported

the facts to the learned Magistrate of Ampara in MC Ampara Case Number B-

5035-17, producing two suspects who allegedly have engaged in digging soil

using a loader machine and transporting the soil in a tipper truck without a

permit. Along with the B-report, he has produced the mentioned loader as well

as the tipper truck used in the transportation of the soil, along with the other

productions.

Subsequently, the two accused had been charged in MC Ampara Case Number

82290/S on following counts.

The charge against the first accused was that he, on 25th August 2017,

used the loader numbered EP ZA-5559 to dig soil without a permit, and

thereby committed an offence punishable in terms of section 63 (1) of the

Mines and Minerals Act No. 33 of 1992 as amended by the Amendment

Act No. 66 of 2009.

The charge against the 2nd accused was that he, at the same time and at

the same transaction, transported the soil that was digged, using a lorry

numbered EP LL-44168 without a permit, and thereby committed an

offence punishable in terms of section 63 (1) of the Act mentioned above.

Both the accused had entered an unconditional plea of guilt before the learned

Magistrate when they were charged, and the learned Magistrate has imposed

sentences on both the accused.

Thereafter, the learned Magistrate has proceeded to release the vehicle which

was the subject matter of the 2nd count preferred against the 2nd accused, but

has decided to allow the parties to show cause as to why the loader used in the

commission of the 1st count should not be confiscated.

Page 5 of 9

Accordingly, the appellant who was the owner of the loader has claimed the

vehicle and had given evidence before the learned Magistrate. He has called

witnesses to support his claim. The learned Magistrate of Ampara by his Order

dated 16-01-2019 has determined that the appellant failed to show sufficient

cause as to why the mentioned loader should not be confiscated and had ordered

the confiscation of the said loader.

It is against this Order that the appellant has preferred an application in revision

to the High Court of Ampara.

I find that the main contention at the hearing the revision application before the

learned High Court Judge of Ampara had been that the loader which was the

subject matter of this claim by the appellant would not fall within the meaning

of machinery or equipment that would be subjected to confiscation in terms of

the Mines and Minerals Act, since a loader is classified as a vehicle in terms of

the Motor Traffic Act. It had been the contention that since vehicle has not been

mentioned as an item that can be confiscated in terms of the Act, the learned

Magistrate was misdirected when he ordered an inquiry and decided to

confiscate the loader.

I find that the learned High Court Judge, after having considered the legal

principles, the intention of the legislature when the amended Act was passed, as

well as the decided cases in this regard, and other relevant facts and

circumstances into consideration, has agreed with the Order of the learned

Magistrate in dismissing the revision application of the appellant.

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant strenuously

contended that although the learned High Court Judge has very correctly

identified the points of determination, the determination that the loader used in

the commission of the offence would fall under the category of an equipment or

machinery used in the commission of the offence, although it had been registered

as a vehicle under the terms of the Motor Traffic Act, was a misdirection.

Page 6 of 9

It was the position of the learned State Counsel that the decided cases pointed

out are cases where the vehicles used in transportation of soil or sand were

confiscated. It was her contention that the decided Court of Appeal cases which

determined that a vehicle used in the transportation of any material that falls

within the interpretation of the Mines and Minerals Act, would not be subjected

to a confiscation order, is different to the facts and the circumstances of the case

under appeal. It was her view that the facts and the circumstances reveal that

the loader used in the commission of the offence had been used not for the

purpose of transportation but as a machinery to dig earth soil and to load the

same to the vehicle which transported the soil. It was her position that it was the

very reason why two separate charges have been framed against the two accused

before the learned Magistrate, for which they have pleaded guilty.

For the better understanding of this judgement, I would now reproduce the

section 63 B (1) of the Mines and Minerals Act as amended by Amendment Act

No. 66 of 2009.

63 B (1). Where any person is convicted of an offence under this Act,

the Magistrate may make order that any mineral, machinery,

equipment or material used in or in connection with, the commission

of that offence or the proceeds of the sale of any such material, or

material deposited in Court under the proviso to section 63 A, be

forfeited to the State.

Although it was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that any

vehicle registered as a vehicle in terms of the Motor Traffic Act would not be

subjected to confiscation in terms of section 63 B (1) of the Act, I am in no

position to agree with such a contention.

I am in no position to disagree with the determination of his Lordship Salam, J.

in Nishantha and Three Others Vs. The State (2014) 1 SLR 2005 and the

determination by His Lordship Dehideniya, J. in Punchirala Danapala Vs. OIC

Police Station Horowpathana and two Others CA (PHC) APN 106/15 decided

Page 7 of 9

on 19-02-2016, given the facts and the circumstances relevant to the appeals

considered by their lordships.

In both the above-mentioned instances, the vehicles that had been used for

transportation of mines and minerals had been confiscated, whereas the facts

and the circumstances in the matter under appeal is very much different.

As determined by Salam, J. in Nishantha and Three Others Vs. The State

(supra), there is no provision that has specifically mentioned that a vehicle used

in the commission of an offence in terms of the Mines and Mineral Act can be

confiscated. His Lordship has made this determination after well considering the

provisions of similar Acts where the vehicle confiscation has been permitted.

However, it is my considered view that there should be a distinction between an

Act which specifically mentions that a vehicle used in commission of a crime is

subjected to confiscation and an Act which has omitted the term vehicle but

has specifically mentioned that any mineral, machinery, equipment or material

used in or in connection with the commission of that offence would be subjected

to be forfeited to the State.

It is my view that even a vehicle registered in terms of the provisions of the Motor

Traffic Act that has been used as machinery or equipment to commit an offence

under the Act, other than transporting the mineral can, fall under the category

of a machinery or equipment, which would be subjected to confiscation.

It is abundantly clear that from the very outset of this action, the Officer-in-

Charge of Damana Police had been well aware of the distinction between a vehicle

and machinery or equipment used in the commission of an offence under the

provisions of the Act. That may be the very reason why he has formulated two

separate charges against the two accused charged before the learned Magistrate

of Ampara. He has preferred the first charge only against the first accused for

digging earth soil without a valid permit using the loader vehicle mentioned in

the charge sheet. The second charge preferred against the second accused had

been on a different basis of transporting the soil in a truck without a valid permit.

Page 8 of 9

It is also very much evident that the learned Magistrate of Ampara was also

knowledgeable of the distinction and the cases decided by the Court of Appeal in

that regard, when he decided to release the vehicle used in transporting the

illegally cut soil while ordering the show cause relating to the loader used in the

offence of digging earth soil as to why it should not be confiscated.

I find that the learned High Court Judge in his well-considered judgement has

considered all the angles of the arguments presented on behalf of the appellant

in coming to his finding that he has no basis to interfere with the order of the

learned Magistrate.

Although the learned Counsel for the appellant contended that a loader is a

vehicle and a vehicle cannot be confiscated under the terms of the Act, as I have

stated before, it is a matter that has to be considered subjective to the facts and

the circumstances of each case.

The learned Counsel for the appellant stated at the very outset of the appeal that

he is not contesting the facts of the matter. It is clear from the charge against

the 1st accused in the Magistrate Court of Ampara, that he had been charged for

digging soil using the mentioned loader for which he has pleaded guilty. Although

a loader is a vehicle that needs registration in terms of the provisions of the Motor

Traffic Act, it becomes necessary to consider the literal meaning of a loader in

order to determine whether it falls under the strict interpretation of a vehicle or

though it may have registered as a vehicle under the Motor Traffic Act, it can fall

under a different definition.

The meaning attributed to the word loader in the Oxford dictionary is that a

machine or a person that loads something.

The meaning given in the Cambridge dictionary is that a machine used for

putting heavy goods onto a vehicle so they can be transported, or the

vehicle used to transport them.

Page 9 of 9

In the Longman dictionary of Contemporary English, the meaning given to the

word loader is a machine used for loading the goods onto trucks or ships.

The above definitions clearly demonstrate that the loader used in the commission

of the offence can under no circumstances be determined as a vehicle used in

the transportation of the illegally mined minerals but used only as a machinery

used in the offence.

I am in no position to agree with the contention of the learned Counsel for the

appellant that the learned High Court Judge has gone on a voyage of discovery

to give a different meaning to the intention of the legislature when the legislature

in its wisdom omitted the name vehicle under the category of the items that can

be subjected to forfeiture in the Act. On the contrary, I find that the learned High

Court Judge has well considered the intention of the legislature in its correct

perspective to come to his determinations, for which I have no reason to disagree

with.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed as it is devoid of merit. The judgement dated

09-03-2021 of the learned High Court Judge of Ampara and the order dated 16-

01-2019 by the learned Magistrate of Ampara affirmed.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to forward this judgement to the High Court

of Ampara along with the original case records, if any, and also to the Magistrate

Court of Ampara for necessary information and action.
