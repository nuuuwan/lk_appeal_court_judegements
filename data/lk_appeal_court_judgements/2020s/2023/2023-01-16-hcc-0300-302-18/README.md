JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The Appellants were indicted for committing the murder of Rexy Manoj de

Seram on the 11th of March 2012, along with a person unknown to the

prosecution.

After a non-jury trial, the Learned High Court Judge has found the

Appellants guilty in terms of Section 296 of Penal Code and sentenced

them to death on 27/09/2018.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this Court.

The Learned Counsels for the Appellants informed this Court that the

Appellants have given consent to argue this matter in their absence due to

the Covid 19 pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellants were

connected via Zoom from prison.

3 | P a g e

The Learned Presidents Counsel who appeared for the 1st Appellant had

filed 07 grounds of appeal. The Counsels appeared for the 2nd and the 3rd

Appellants filed 04 grounds of appeal each.

At the very outset on the first date of the argument, Learned Presidents

Counsel appearing on behalf of the 1st Appellant highlighting certain

portions of the judgment, had submitted to this Court that this is an

appropriate case to be sent for a re-trial due to some misdirection. This

suggestion was endorsed by the Counsels for the 2nd and the 3rd Appellants

as well. The Learned DSG agreed to consider whether there are grounds for

sending this case for a re-trial.

As there was no agreement reached between the Counsels for the

Appellants and the Learned DSG regarding sending this case for a re-trial,

the argument continued and concluded on 11/11/2022.

The prosecution had called 11 witnesses and marked productions P1-12

and closed their case. The Learned High Court Judge had called for the

defence and all the Appellants made dock statements and closed their case.

Background of the Case

In this case PW2 and PW3 have given evidence as eye witnesses to the

incident.

According to PW2, Tharanga Fernando, he, the deceased, PW3 and three

others started to consume liquor from 12.00 noon on the date of the

incident. After consuming liquor at one Roshans house, all had gone to

Pradeepa Grounds to watch an Elle match at about 6.00 p.m. The group

had consumed liquor again at the side of the ground. At about 7.00 p.m.

The 1st and the 2nd Appellant had come there in a motor bike and the 2nd

Appellant had asked from the group whether they were police officers.

Having offended by the said utterance of the 2nd Appellant, PW3 had

thrown a bottle towards the 2nd Appellant which had struck on the nose of

the 2nd Appellant. The deceased too had assaulted the 2nd Appellant

4 | P a g e

thereafter. After this incident the 1st and the 2nd Appellant had left the

place. The deceased had told the 1st Appellant that he has no problem

with him. But he had said that he has a problem with the 2nd Appellant.

After this incident, the group had continued drinking for about 15 minutes

and the deceased had gone to a place called 4th section talking over the

phone. PW2 had gone to 5th section to answer a call of nature. At that time,

he had seen both the 1st and the 2nd Appellants cutting the deceased with

swords. According to him, he had witnessed this incident with the aid of

the light emanating from Nilurajs house and also from a street light. He

had seen only the 1st and the 2nd Appellants cutting the deceased.

In the cross examination this witness had admitted that the group which

consisted of 6 persons had consumed about six bottles of alcohol up to the

time of the incident.

PW3, Indika had corroborated the evidence of PW2 but additionally he had

said that he saw 3rd Appellant assaulting the deceased with an iron pipe

with another person unknown to him.

Although full argument had been concluded, I consider it appropriate to

consider whether this a fit and proper case to send for a re-trial. The appeal

grounds raised by all three Counsels will be considered only if necessary.

The Learned High Court Judge in her judgment at page 441(26th paragraph)

had stated even though the Counsels appeared for them had raised the

state of intoxication level of the witnesses and the deceased, the defence

had failed to prove the same. The relevant portion of the judgment is re-

produced below:

In King v. Albert Appuhamy 41 NLR 505 the court held that:

.Failure on the part of prisoner or his Counsel to take up a certain

line of defence does not relieve a Judge of the responsibility of putting

the jury such defence if it arises on the evidence.

In this case the purported eye witnesses and the deceased had consumed

six bottles of alcohol. Their group consisted of six persons. The average

consumption per person is one bottle. This is very high consumption and

this evidence should have been considered by the Learned High Court. Not

considering the state of intoxication of the witnesses and the deceased is a

clear misdirection. Further, the initial fight had started by PW2 and the

deceased. Failure to consider this evidence by the Learned High Court

Judge had caused great prejudice and denial a fair trial to the Appellants.

The Learned High Court Judge in her judgment admitted that on two

occasions the defence had highlighted contradictory evidence given by PW2.

She had simply ignored the said contradictory evidence simply because of

the failure to mark those either as contradictions or omissions by the

defence. The Learned Presidents Counsel strenuously argued that this

ignorance of the Learned High Court Judge had caused a great prejudice to

his client as well as the 2nd and the 3rd Appellants.

Jayant Patel, J. in the case of Jusabbhai Ayubbhai v. State of Gujarat

CR.MA/623/2012 stated that:

..It is by now recognized principles that justice to one party should

not result into injustice to the other side and it will be for the Court to

balance the right of both the sides and to uphold the law.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge had failed to evaluate the vital

points of the evidence of PW2 which certainly affect the fair trial

entitlement of the Appellants.

The Learned Presidents Counsel further argued that the Learned High

Court Judge had perused the PW2s police statement and evidence given in

the non-summary inquiry when she was writing the judgment.

The Learned High Court Judge in her judgment at pages 438-439(22nd

paragraph) had compared the evidence of PW2 with his statement to police

and evidence given in the non-summary inquiry. The relevant portions are

re-produced below:

Further, the Learned High Court Judge in her judgment at page 474(78th

paragraph) had referred the police statement of the 1st Appellant after the

dock statements of all Appellants. The relevant portion is re-produced

below:

The above highlighted portions of the judgements are clear misdirection

and bad in law.

In Punchimahattaya v.The State 76 NLR 564 the court held that:

Court of Criminal Appeal (or Supreme Court in appeal) has no

authority to peruse statements of witnesses recorded by the police in

the course of their investigation, (i.e., statement in the Information

Book) other than those properly admitted in evidence by way of

contradiction or otherwise.

It is trite law that a judge has no power to utilize the statements made by

witnesses to the police, inquest evidence and non-summary evidence when

they were not properly admitted in evidence. In this case as the Learned

High Court Judge had adopted an incorrect approach by referring and

comparing police statement and non-summary evidence of PW2 when she

evaluated the evidence given by PW2 in the High Court trial. This is a

fundamental error on the part of the Learned High Court Judge which

certainly prejudicial to the substantial rights of the Appellant.

Finally, the Learned Presidents Counsel contended that the Learned High

Court Judge had reversed the burden of proof on the defence.

In a criminal trial, it is incumbent on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt. There is no burden on the Appellant to prove his

innocence. This is the Golden Thread as discussed in Woolmington v.

DPP [1935] A.C.462. In this case Viscount Sankey J held that:

8 | P a g e

Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is

always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the

prisoners guilt If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there

is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the

prosecution or the prisoner..the prosecution has not made out the

case and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.

The Learned Trial Judge in her judgment at page 460(57th paragraph) and

at page 463(62nd paragraph) had stated as follows:

The above quoted portions of the judgment are clear indication that the

Learned High Court Judge had reversed the burden of proof on the

Appellants, which is unknown to the criminal prosecution.

The above considered submissions of Learned Presidents Counsel who

appeared the 1st Appellant clearly endorses the fact that the Appellants had

not afforded a fair trial, which is a fundamental responsibility bestowed

upon the judiciary. When this responsibility is not followed properly, the

outcome will vitiate the whole proceedings, including the judgments and

therefore demand a re-trial.

9 | P a g e

The criteria and the principles when cases are sent back for re-trial has

been discussed at length in the following authority.

In Nasib Singh v.State of Punjab (2021 SCC online SC 924) Criminal

Appeal No.1051-1054 of 2021 decided on 8th October 2021the court held

that:

(i) The Appellate Court may direct a re-trial only in exceptional

circumstances to avert a miscarriage of justice;

(ii) Mere lapses in the investigation are not sufficient to warrant a direction

for re-trial. Only if the lapses are so grave so as to prejudice the rights of

the parties, can a re-trial be directed;

(iii) A determination of whether a shoddy investigation/trial has prejudiced

the party, must be based on the facts of each case pursuant to a thorough

reading of the evidence;

(iv) It is not sufficient if the accused/ prosecution makes a facial argument

that there has been a miscarriage of justice warranting a re-trial. It is

incumbent on the Appellate Court directing a re-trial to provide a reasoned

order on the nature of the miscarriage of justice caused with reference to

the evidence and investigatory process;

(v) If a matter is directed for re-trial, the evidence and record of the

previous trial is completely wiped out; and

(vi) The following are some instances, not intended to be exhaustive, of

when the Court could order a re-trial on the ground of miscarriage of

justice:

a) The trial court has proceeded with the trial in the absence of

jurisdiction;

b) The trial has been vitiated by an illegality or irregularity based on

a misconception of the nature of the proceedings; and

10 | P a g e

c) The prosecutor has been disabled or prevented from adducing

evidence as regards the nature of the charge, resulting in the trial

being rendered a farce, sham or charade.

In this case the Judgment contains lots of irregularity. The said

irregularities are so grave as it prejudiced the substantial rights of the

Appellants which cannot be overlooked. Further, the Learned Trial Judge

had totally ignored the concept of fair trial. Hence, I set aside the conviction

and the sentence imposed on the Appellant on 27/09/2018 by the Learned

High Court Judge of Chilaw.

As right to a fair trial is at demand in this case, I consider ordering a re-

trial in this case is justifiable. Hence, I order a re-trial directing the Learned

High Court Judge to conclude the re-trial expeditiously.

The appeal is, therefore allowed.

The Registrar of this court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to

High Court of Chilaw along with the original case record.

I agree.
