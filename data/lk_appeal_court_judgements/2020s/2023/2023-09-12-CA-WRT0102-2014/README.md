reliefs;

a. Writ of Mandamus directing the respondent to make payment to the

petitioner in the form of a GST refund, lawfully due to the petitioner

for the months of April, May, June, and July 2002 in a total sum of

Rs. 47,267,963.30.

b. A writ of Mandamus directing the respondent to make payment to the

petitioner in the form of GST refund, lawfully due to him for the

12,054,948.00 together with the interest due and computed thereon

5

from the respective due dates of the said refund in 2002 up to

31.12.2003 subject to any appropriate terms/conditions.

Facts in brief

The petitioner carries on business of manufacturing garments for export

under the name and style of Nisha Garments. Nisha Garments has been

registered under the Goods and Services Tax at No. 34 of 1996 (hereinafter

referred to as the GST Act) and has been assigned the GST registration No.

643182165-5000.

The petitioner has submitted GST returns to the respondent for the following

periods and the claimed refunds are set out below:

Period GST Refund (Amount)

01/04/2002 to 30/04/2002 Rs. 3,723,401/=

01/05/2002 to 31/05/2002 Rs. 3,773,651/=

01/06/2002 to 31/06/2002 Rs. 3,862,625/=

01/07/2002 to 31/07/2002 Rs. 1,058,197/=

The respondent objected to the petitioners application on the following

grounds:

The respondent issued notices dated 24.10.2002, 28.11.2002, 24.02.2003

and 29.07.2003, marked as P6, instructing the petitioner to produce original

invoices and other relevant documents to substantiate his refund claims.

However, due to the petitioners failure to provide the required documents,

the respondent was not able to proceed with the refund claims. The

abovementioned notices were marked by the petitioner as P6.

The respondent sought the following documents from the petitioner to

confirm the petitioners refund claim.

1. Copies of the return furnished,

2. A schedule of GST paid on other purchases,

6

6

3. Custom acknowledgement receipt,

4. Original cusdecs in respect of the input tax claimed for the period,

5. Original invoices and payment vouchers from Kabool Lanka Pvt Ltd.,

Kuruwita Merchants Textiles Mills and Jubilee Agencies Ltd.,

The respondent further stated that the petitioner failed to submit the

documents as requested by the above notices, which were required to

process the refund claims.

The respondent stated as follows in the objections to this application.

a. The petitioner has not taken steps in accordance with the rules and

procedure for the refund of GST as claimed by him.

b. The petitioner has failed to hand over the original invoices and the

required documents to substantiate his claim for the GST refund.

c. The petitioner had thus failed to substantiate his claims for GST

refunds.

d. The petitioner has failed to comply with the provisions of GST Act

No.34 of 1996, as amended.

e. The petitioner is not entitled in law to any GST refunds for the period

set out in the petition.

f. In the above circumstances, the petitioner is not entitled to the

payment of any interest.

In addition to the above objections, the respondent has taken up the

following objections to the petitioners application.

a. The petitioners application is vexatious and misconceived in law.

b. The petitioners application is an abuse of the process of court.

c. The petitioner is guilty of laches.

d. The petitioner has suppressed and misrepresented material facts.

The respondent denies the receipt of the documents marked P11(b), P12,

P14, P7 (a), P7 (b), P9 and P10. The respondent further submitted that if the

7

7

petitioner had submitted the original documents to the Inland Revenue

Department, it would have issued a receipt of acknowledgement.

The respondents position is that the respondent cannot entertain and

process the refund claims in terms of law since the petitioner has failed to

submit the originals of the invoices and the other required documents to

substantiate the claims.

The petitioner argues that the respondent did not dispute the petitioners

claims for GST refunds when he sent the request for the refund. The

petitioner further contends that the respondent had conceded the

petitioners claims for such GST refunds.

Section 22 (1), 22 (2), and 22 (3) of the GST Act provides as follows:

22.

(1) A registered person shall, in respect of taxable supplies made by him,

account for and pay the tax by reference to such taxable periods at such

time and in such manner as may be specified in the Act.

(2) Subject to the provisions of the Act, a registered person is entitled at the

end of each such period to credit for so much of his input tax as is

allowable under this Act. And then to deduct such amount from any

output tax that is due from him.

(3) Where goods or services supplied to a registered person, or goods

imported by him, are used or to be used partly for the purposes of a

taxable activity carried on or carried out by him and partly for other

purposes, the tax on supplies and importations shall be apportioned so

that only so much of the tax on such supply or importation as is

referable to his taxable activity shall be counted as his input tax.

In order to claim a GST refund, a registered person must satisfy the fact that

he is entitled to recover the excessive input tax in terms of the GST Act.

Sections 58 and 59 of the GST Act are as follows:

58

(1)Where a registered person makes an application for a refund of any tax or

any penalty paid by him in excess during the taxable period within three

years immediately after the end of the taxable period and satisfies the

Commissioner-General that such person has paid any tax or any

penalty in excess of the amount which he was liable to pay for that

period, such person shall be entitled to a refund of the amount paid

in excess, subject to provisions of subsection (3):

(2) Where through death, incapacity, bankruptcy, liquidation or other cause a

registered person who would but for such cause have been entitled to make a

claim under subsection (1) is unable to do so, his executor, trustee or receiver

as the case may be, shall be entitled to a refund of any tax or penalty paid in

excess within the meaning of subsection (1) by such person for the benefit of

such person or his estate.

(3) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1)-

(a) Where any registered person has failed to pay the Commissioner-

General in whole or in part, any tax in respect of any taxable period, or

a month in a taxable period, any amount of tax payable before the due

date may be set off after due notice to such person against that unpaid

tax, any amount or any part of any amount otherwise refundable to that

person or any amount or part of any amount of interest payable to that

person under section 59, and shall treat any amount so set off as a

payment received from such registered person.

(b) Where any registered person, in respect of, any taxable period or in a

month in a taxable period has not furnished a return for any taxable

period or a month in a taxable period, the Commissioner-General may

withhold payment of any amount otherwise refundable or any amount

of interest payable under section 59 of this Act, until such registered

person has furnished such return.

9

9

59.

(1) Where any amount refundable under this Act to refunds a registered

person has not been refunded within a period of thirty days from the

due date of such refund there shall be paid by the Commissioner-

General to such person interest on such amount for the period

commencing on the Thirtieth day from the due date up to the date of

refund of the amount as is required to be refunded by the

Commissioner-General to such person under this Act, at the rate

prescribed by the Minister from time to time

(2) For the purposes of this section due date means the period ending

ninety days

(i) From the date of any agreement with an Assessor or from the

date of determination of an appeal in respect of the assessment

appealed against or ;

(ii) From the date on which a claim , other than a claim for a refund

made in writing under subsection (4) of section 22 was received

from such person by the Commissioner-General

In terms of the provisions of Section 58, the petitioner must prove that he is

entitled to a refund and it should include showing that he has overpaid tax

or penalty by providing relevant documents.

If the petitioner fails to satisfactorily prove his entitlement to a refund in

terms of law by producing tax invoices and other relevant documents, such

refund claims by the petitioner cannot be granted by the respondent.

After the abovementioned notices were issued to the petitioner in the year

2002 to produce the necessary documents, there was no correspondence

between the petitioner and the respondent until 27.10.2009 by letter marked

P7 (a) and P7 (b) dated 20.01.2010. The respondent has denied the receipt of

P7(a) and P7(b). By letter dated 27.09.2011 sent to the respondent, the

petitioner has taken up the position that he had handed over the original

10

10

invoices to the respondents in regard to GST refund claims for the year

2002. However, the petitioner has not taken up this position in any

correspondence before P 11(a) dated 27.09.2011.

In this application, the respondent seriously disputes the fact that the

petitioner has submitted relevant documents to substantiate the GST refund

claims made by the petitioner.

It is quite clear that the petitioner is required to establish his eligibility for

GST refund by submitting necessary documents. In this application, there

is no evidence to show that the petitioner submitted all the relevant

documents to the respondent. The respondent contends that if the

respondent had accepted the documents, a receipt of acknowledgement

would have been issued to the petitioner. However, the petitioner has not

produced such a receipt. The facts necessary to support the petitioners

entitlement are in dispute. Despite the petitioners claim that the respondent

did not contest their refund request when it was initially submitted, the

respondent issued notices to the petitioner requesting the originals of tax

invoices and other relevant documents to substantiate the claims. There is

no evidence to prove that the petitioner had supplied these documents to the

respondent. Furthermore, the petitioner has not produced any receipt of

acknowledgement issued by the Inland Revenue Department.

In the case of Thajudeen vs Sri Lanka Tea Board [1981] 1SriLR 471,

Ranasinghe J (as he was then) quoted the following passage

CHOUDRI in his book on the Law of Writs and Fundamental Rights

(2nd Ed.), Vol.2, states at page 381: "The rule has been stated that

mandamus will not lie to compel a public officer to perform a duty

dependent upon disputed and doubtful facts, or where the legal result

of the facts is subject to controversy. If the right is in serious doubt

the discretionary power rests with the officer to decide whether or not

he will enforce it, till the right shall have been established in some

proper action, and discretion fairly exercised in such circumstances

11

11

cannot be controlled by mandamus;" and, at page 449: "Where facts

are in dispute and in order to get at the truth it is necessary that the

questions should be canvassed in a suit where parties would have

ample opportunity of examining their witnesses and the Court would

be better able to judge which version is correct, a writ will not issue."

Further, it says as follows:

When, however, such questions of fact are in dispute they can and

must only be settled by a regular action between the disputants before

the appropriate Court of First Instance. Such questions, the decision

of which calls for the leading of evidence, both oral and documentary

and the cross-examination of witnesses are all questions which can be

best decided by way of regular procedure falling within the ordinary

jurisdiction of the Courts of First Instance.

Without establishing necessary facts, no public right will arise for the

petitioner to seek for a Writ of Mandamus. Since the petitioner has failed to

substantiate the GST refund claims by producing necessary documents, no

public duty casts upon the respondent to make payments in the form of GST

refunds.

The petitioner is guilty of laches.

The petitioner filed this application in 2014 seeking a Writ of Mandamus

directing the respondent to make payments for the GST refund claims for the

year 2002, after a delay of 12 years. When the petitioner was notified to

produce the relevant documents in 2002 and 2003, there was no response

from the petitioner. Correspondence between parties began approximately

seven years later, in 2009, and that was initiated by the petitioner. The

petitioner has not provided any explanation for the prolonged lack of

communication. This application before this court was filed 12 years after

the submission of those claims. The petitioner has not provided any

explanation for the 12-year delay in making this application. In the written

12

12

submission on behalf of the petitioner, it was argued that there is a provision

in the Act to pay interest, thereby making the delay irrelevant.

The provisions to pay interest for the money due have been provided for the

benefit of the applicants if the payments are delayed. The petitioner cannot

rely on that provision to excuse the 12-year delay and laches. Furthermore,

the Act provides to pay interest after 90 days. When comparing 90 days to

12 years, the delay on the part of the petitioner is excessive and

unreasonable. The submission in this regard is not tenable given the

circumstances of the case.

In the case of Ramasamy vs Ceylon State Mortgage Bank 78NLR 510

Wanasundera J, quoting from a Privy Council case of Lindsay Petroleum

Company vs Hurd, stated as follows:

The doctrine of laches in Court of Equity is not an arbitrary or a

technical doctrine. Where it would be practically unjust to give a

remedy, either because the party has, by his conduct, done that which

might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his

conduct and neglect he has, though perhaps not waiving that remedy,

yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable

to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of

these cases, lapse of time and delay are most material. But in every

case, if an argument against relief, which otherwise should be unjust, is

founded upon mere delay, that delay of course not amounting to a bar

by any Statute of Limitations, the validity of that defence must be tried

upon principles substantially equitable. Two circumstances, always

important in such cases, are, the length of the delay and the nature of

the acts done during the interval which might affect either party and

cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one course or the

other, so far as relates to the remedy.

In the case of Athula Ratnayake vs Jayasinge 78NLR 35, the Supreme Court

held that the delay of one year and three months, which had not been

13

13

satisfactorily explained by the petitioner, barred the remedy. The Court has a

discretion which it could exercise to refuse the application on the ground

that there had been undue delay in bringing the proceedings.

In the case of Rev. Seruwila Sarankithi and others v The Attorney General

and others [2004]1Sri LR 356 Wijayaratne J has quoted the case of Abdul

Rahuman v The Mayor of Colombo 69NLR 211 with regard to the unexplained

delay, where it was held as follows:

it is sufficient for us to say that in view of this delay and the

consequences of such delay, an application for a writ of mandamus

must fail."

The petitioner has failed to substantiate the GST refund claims by producing

necessary documents. This application was filed 12 years after the refund

claims were submitted, indicating an inordinate delay. For the reasons set

out in this judgment application of the petitioner is dismissed without costs.
