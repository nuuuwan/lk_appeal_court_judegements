Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved of his conviction and the sentence by the learned

High Court Judge of Monaragala.

The appellant was initially indicted before the High Court of Monaragala on two

counts, namely;

1. That on or about 08-07-2012, he committed the offence of abduction

from the lawful guardianship, a minor at a place called Palassa within

the jurisdiction of the High Court of Monaragala, and thereby

committing an offence punishable in terms of section 354 of the Penal

Code.

2. At the same time and at the same transaction, for having committed

the offence of grave sexual abuse of the said minor and committing an

offence punishable in terms of section 365 B (2) (b) of the Penal Code

as amended by Penal Code (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1995, 29 of

1998, 16 of 2006.

While the evidence in chief of the victim child who was called as PW-01 to give

evidence before the trial Court was in progress, the Prosecuting State Counsel

Page 3 of 20

has moved to amend the date of the offence of the charges to read as between

the period of 08-07-2012 and 20-08-2012 which has been allowed by the Court.

As a result, the amended indictment had been read over to the appellant for

which he has again pleaded not guilty, and the trial has proceeded to its

conclusion on the basis of the amended indictment.

The learned High Court Judge of Monaragala found the appellant guilty of the

judgement dated 28-01-2022 for both the counts preferred against him, and

after having heard the submissions of the prosecution as well as the appellant

with regard to the sentence, passed the following sentence on him.

1. On the 1st count, 5 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.

5000/-. In default of paying the fine, a simple imprisonment period of

6 months.

2. On the 2nd count, 15 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.

10000/-. In default of paying the fine, 6 months simple imprisonment.

In addition to the above sentence and the fines, the appellant was ordered to pay

Rs. 200000/- as compensation to PW-01 who was the victim of this incident,

and in default of paying the said compensation, it was ordered to be recovered

as a fine and a default sentence of 2 years rigorous imprisonment was imposed

on the appellant.

The above-mentioned two jail terms were ordered to be concurrent to each other,

which means a total period of 15 years rigorous imprisonment.

Facts in Brief

The victim child relating to this incident who gave evidence as PW-01 was 16

years of age when she gave evidence for the first time on 02-07-2019. She has

been a child of about 09 years during the time period relevant to the charges. At

the time she gave evidence before the trial Court, she was studying in grade 10

and was under the care of Madurukatiya Childrens Home.

Page 4 of 20

She has two younger sisters and a brother, and another elder sister as well. Her

mother was living with a person called Ajith Prasanna along with the victim child

and her siblings. She has been studying at grade 04 of the Kiuleara School at

that time.

She has given her birth date as 24th February 2003 and has stated that the

incidents of sexual abuse occurred in the year 2012, although she cannot

remember the months or the dates.

Describing the incidents, she has stated that while she was going to school, the

uncle she refers to as Dinki Maama who is a person herding cattle called her and

she went with him because she could not understand the gravity of it. The

mentioned Dinki Maama was a person well known to the victim child and was

their neighbour. She has identified the appellant as the said person. According

to her evidence, she and her parents used the well belonging to the appellant for

their water needs and was in the habit of going to his house for various other

needs as well.

Describing an incident, she had stated that on one day, her mother went to the

well and she went subsequently to collect water, carrying a clay pot and two

plastic containers in a wheelbarrow. While she was taking the wheelbarrow

towards the well, the appellant has called her from a thicket nearby and when

she went towards him, her mothers paramour whom she refers to as Bappa saw

the incident and called her, which led to her revealing what was happening

between her and the appellant to Bappa as well as her mother.

However, she has maintained that nothing happened to her on the date these

incidents came to light, but previously, the appellant used to take her to a

wooded area on her way to and from her school and commit intercrural sex with

her. She has described how the sexual acts took place and stated that the

appellant used to place his penis on her vagina and had intercrural sex with her

placing the penis between her thighs.

Page 5 of 20

She has explained that because of the threats made by the appellant towards

her mother, she did not divulge these incidents to anybody, but later informed

the sexual harassments faced by her to one of her teachers at school.

Her evidence reveals that neither she nor her parents have complained about

these incidents to the police, but the police have come to their house after

receiving an information about the grave sexual abuse incidents faced by the

victim child.

While giving evidence and describing the details of the sexual abuse faced by

her, the victim, although initially had stated that she cannot remember the

month when these incidents occurred had come out saying that her statement

to police was on 28th August 2012, and the sexual abuse incidents happened few

months before she made the statement to the police, which appears to be the

reason for the Prosecuting State Counsel to amend the date of offence in the

indictment indicating a period of time as the victim child was unable to give a

definitive date of the incidents.

The victim childs birth certificate has been marked as P-01 at the trial. While

under cross-examination, she has identified her school as Kiuleara Primary

School.

On behalf of the appellant, several contradictions in relation to the statement

made by her to the police and the evidence given in Court had been marked.

The victim has maintained the position that the incident happened in the year

2012, however, in the police statement, she had stated that even on 24th August

2011, sexual abuse took place. She has denied that she made such a statement,

and the said contradiction has been marked as V-01. She has denied that she

said that the incident happened around 10 am in the police statement, which

has been marked as V-02. In her evidence, she has stated that the incidents

happened near the bunt and no one was there when the incidents occurred, but

she has denied what she has stated in her police statement, that the incidents

happened while returning with her sister after attending a class. The said

Page 6 of 20

contradiction has been marked as V-03. The position taken up by the witness in

her evidence had been that she cannot remember the dates of the incidents,

however in the police statement she had stated that the incident happened the

following day, meaning the 2nd incident happened a day after the 1st incident.

Since the witness had denied saying so, the said contradiction has been marked

as V-04.

However, it is clear from the victims evidence that she has been consistent in

her position that she was subjected to grave sexual abuse several times over a

short period of time, and the said abuses came to light only after her Bappa

suspected of something strange happening and questioned her.

The position taken up by the appellant had been that no such incidents took

place and because the appellant made an indecent proposal to her mother, a

false complaint was made against the appellant at the instigation of the mother,

which has been denied by the victim child.

In this matter, the prosecution has called PW-03 who was living with the mother

of the victim child as husband and wife during the time relevant to this incident.

He is the person who has been referred to as Bappa by the victim child. At the

time of giving evidence before the trial Court, having been convicted of an offence

of murder, he was an imprisoned death row inmate.

According to him, the victim child has informed about the grave sexual abuse

faced by her at the hands of the appellant. It was his evidence that even before

the victim child informed, the two younger children come and informed him that

Dingiri Maama took the sister, meaning the victim child, to the forest by giving

biscuits to them. When he questioned the victim child, she has explained the

grave sexual abuse faced by her. The witness has identified the appellant as the

person mentioned as Dingiri Maama, whom he has referred to as Dingiri Ayya.

The appellant was a person living next to their land, and it appears that the

victims family had been dependent on the appellant and his family for various

needs. PW-03 in his evidence has stated that although he was informed of the

Page 7 of 20

sexual abuse incidents faced by the victim child, he or his wife did not go to the

police and complain due to them being so poor.

According to him, it was the police who came to their house and inquired about

the incidents, which led him revealing to the police of what he knew. It has been

stated by the witness that before these sexual abuse incidents came to be known,

they had no issues with the appellant and were in very good terms.

Under cross-examination, the witness has explained in detail about the 1st

incident where the child went to fetch water pulling a wheelbarrow and reasons

as to why he went looking for the child as he could not hear from her. According

to him, when he went looking for the child, he has seen her coming out of the

thicket nearby and the appellant leaving from the other side of the thicket.

He has stated that he cannot exactly remember whether his wife informed him

of any sexual advances made by the appellant towards her, and has maintained

the position that because of the desperate living conditions they were in, and

their inability to confront others, they decided to leave this area and go

elsewhere, but it was the police who came looking for them.

The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who examined the child has marked his

Medico-Legal Report as P-02 and has given evidence in detail of his observations

of the victim child. He has failed to observe any telltale marks of sexual abuse,

but has expressed the opinion that such sexual abuse can occur without any

evidence being present on the body of a child.

According to the evidence of the JMO, since he was unable to communicate with

the child properly, he has relied on the statement made to him by the mother of

the child to record the history of the incident. The JMO has expressed the

opinion that the child also may have enjoyed the incidents of abuse, as she had

been slow to come out with the incidents.

The main investigating officer who conducted investigations has given evidence

and had stated that the investigations into the incident commenced after the

Page 8 of 20

police station received an anonymous letter regarding the incidents of sexual

abuse faced by the victim child. After commencing the investigations, he has

recorded the statement of the victim child and has entered his observations in

relation to the places of the incidents as shown by the victim child.

According to the police evidence, the letter informing the sexual abuse incidents

had been received by the police on 28-08-2012 and the victim child had shown

two places where the incidents had taken place.

After the conclusion of the prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge

having considered the evidence led has decided to call for a defence from the

appellant, wherein, he has given evidence under oath.

According to the appellant, he is a farmer as well as a person who owned several

heads of cattle. He was married with four grown up children. He has admitted

that the victim child and their family were living about 300 meters away from

his house and they used to have a close relationship with him and his family.

He has denied that he sexually abused the victim child and was in the habit of

giving various gifts to attract the child towards him. He has maintained that the

complaint against him was a false one and has claimed that the family members

of the victim child used to come to his land and pluck produce for which he used

to scold them, which may be the reason why a false complaint has been made

against him.

While maintaining that position, the appellant has also claimed that the mother

of the victim child, namely, Anusha used to ask for money from him and one day

he proposed to her that she should have sex with him, for which she got angry

and scolded him. He has claimed that this also may be a reason why a petition

was sent against him after two or three months from the said proposal made by

him.

When the prosecution and the defence cases were closed, the learned High Court

Judge having considered the evidence before the Court had decided to call the

Page 9 of 20

mother of the victim child who was listed as PW-02 in the list of witnesses of the

indictment, but not called, in terms of section 439 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act.

Section 439 of the Act is the provision where the Court can summon any person

as a witness and examine, if the evidence of such a person appears to Court

would be essential to come to a just decision of a case.

Accordingly, PW-02 mentioned in the indictment has given evidence. She has

stated that she came to know about the grave sexual abuse incidents faced by

her daughter through her younger son who is now a Buddhist priest. Although

she has questioned her daughter, she has not revealed much detail but after

punishing her, she has come out with what was happening to her at the hands

of appellant whom she referred to as Dingi Ayya. However, it is clear from her

evidence that she and her husband have not complained to any authority, but it

was the police who came to their house and took steps to investigate after

receiving an information in this regard.

Under cross-examination, she has confirmed that her family was dependent on

the appellants family for their needs, but has denied that it was the appellant

who helped them, but his wife. She has stated that the appellant wanted to have

an affair with her, but she did not agree. However, she did not do anything in

relation to the indecent proposal of the appellant and came to know about the

details of the sexual abuse incidents faced by her daughter only after police came

to their house and recorded statements.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel formulated the

following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. Has inadmissible evidence been led regarding the alleged previous

incidents of grave sexual abuse which does not form the fact in issue

Page 10 of 20

or relevant fact pertaining to the case, and therefore, is the conviction

vitiated.

2. Has the learned High Court Judge taken into consideration

inadmissible hearsay evidence and thereby did a miscarriage of justice

occur to the appellant.

3. Has the learned High Court Judge taken into consideration that there

are no corroboration of the complainants evidence and therefore is the

conviction bad in law.

4. Has the prosecution proved the case against the accused appellant

beyond reasonable doubt.

5. Has the learned High Court Judge not properly analyzed defence

evidence having regard to the guidelines set by the Superior Courts

denying the accused appellant a fair trial.

6. Has the learned trial Judge not considered the matters favourable to

the accused appellant.

7. Without prejudice to the above questions of law, is the imposition of the

sentence excessive.

The learned Presidents Counsel contended that the initial charge against the

appellant was based on a single act of grave sexual abuse supposed to have been

committed on a single day. However, while the victim child was giving evidence,

the indictment was amended to indicate a time period rather than a single date.

But, the charge remained in relation to only one act of grave sexual abuse.

He brought to the attention of the Court section 5 of the Evidence Ordinance,

which reads thus;

5. Evidence may be given in any suit or proceeding of the existence

or non-existence of every fact in issue and of other such facts as are

hereinafter declared to be relevant and of no others.

It was his position that the fact in issue was whether the appellant committed

one act of grave sexual abuse during the mentioned period and therefore any

Page 11 of 20

evidence regarding other acts allegedly committed by the appellant has no

relevance and completely inadmissible evidence. It was his argument that the

learned High Court Judge in her judgement has considered this inadmissible

evidence to find the appellant guilty.

Referring to the evidence of the stepfather Ajith Prasanna where he says that the

child informed him of the sexual abuse committed by the appellant on the day

he saw the child going to the thicket near the well of the appellants house, it

was his contention that the evidence of the victim child had been otherwise. Her

testimony has been that when she was about to go inside the thicket, her

stepfather called her and questioned her, and he punished her because she did

not say anything to him.

The learned Presidents Counsel took up the position that since the evidence in

relation to the incident where the appellant stood indicted are contradictory to

each other, the learned High Court Judge was wrong in relying on such

contradictory evidence to convict the appellant. He pointed out further the delay

in making a complaint and not making a statement to the police came looking

for the victim child and her parents, also creates a doubt as to the truthfulness

of the evidence of the relevant witnesses.

Commenting on the evidence of the JMO, it was his view that the evidence does

not support the other witnesses claim of a grave sexual abuse of the child by the

appellant.

He lamented that the learned High Court Judge while considering the evidence

in favour of the prosecution, has failed to consider the evidence that favoured

the stand of the appellant who denied that he committed any sexual abuse of

the child.

It was his stand that if the evidence was considered in the correct manner, the

evidence that favours the appellant could have provided a sufficient basis to

acquit the appellant as the prosecution has failed to prove the charges beyond

reasonable doubt.

Page 12 of 20

It was his position that considering all these matters together, it is obvious that

a fair trial has not been afforded to the appellant.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) who represented the respondent

brought to the notice of the Court that neither the victim child nor her parents

went to the police to make a complaint and it was after receiving an anonymous

petition the investigations relating to this incident has commenced. It was his

position that this in itself shows that the mother and the stepfather, as well as

the victim child, have been truthful as to the incidents that happened to the

child.

It was his position that the reasons for the child not to divulge the incidents to

her mother or the stepfather had been clearly established by way of evidence and

also the reasons of their reluctance to go to the police due to their dependence

on the appellant and his family in their lives.

The learned DSG insisted that the evidence of the stepfather and the mother of

the child are very much consistent with the evidence of the victim child. It was

his position that the amending of the indictment as to the date of offence to

indicate that it occurred during a certain period of time has not prejudiced the

appellant as his defence was a complete denial of the act and he had all the

possibilities of cross-examining the witnesses and put forward the stand as the

amendment has been effected at the very beginning of the evidence given by the

victim child.

He was of the view that the evidence of the JMO was consistent with the evidence

of the victim child and his opinion that a sexual abuse as claimed by the victim

can occur without any injuries or marks being present should be considered by

taking the evidence in its totality, which has been the case in this trial.

The learned DSG moved for the dismissal of the appeal on the basis that it has

no merit.

Page 13 of 20

Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal

As the grounds of appeal pleaded by the appellant are interrelated, the said

grounds of appeal will be considered together.

The evidence led at the trial when taken in its totality becomes clear that the

family of the victim child who lived adjacent to the land belonging to the appellant

were very much dependent on the appellant and his family in their daily lives.

Their water source had been a well situated within the appellants land, and even

they had been dependent on the generosity of the other household members of

the appellants family to fulfill various needs.

The evidence of the child, the stepfather as well as the mother needs to be

considered in that context as correctly considered by the learned High Court

Judge in her judgement. The learned High Court Judge has clearly considered

the evidence of the victim child, namely PW-01 considering the basic yardsticks

of evaluating such evidence, namely the tests of probability, consistency, and

spontaneity.

It is clear from the charge that it has been formulated on the basis of what

happened on the day the stepfather observed the suspicious behaviour of the

child. The learned High Court Judge too has considered the evidence before the

trial Court on that basis and not on the basis of several sexual acts committed

during the period. The learned High Court Judge has considered the evidence in

relation to other similar instances only to test whether the evidence of the victim

child and that of the stepfather and the mother can be believed.

The learned High Court Judge has considered the observations made by the

investigating officer of the place of the incident and had come to a correct finding

that such an incident as claimed by the victim child and the stepfather can

occur.

The learned High Court Judge has considered the contradictions marked during

the testimony of the victim child where she has spoken of several other incidents

Page 14 of 20

of grave sexual abuse committed by the appellant on her. As observed correctly,

those were not material contradictions that go into the root of the matter and

has not created any doubt as to the evidence led.

In the case of State of U.P. Vs. M. K. Anthony, AIR 1985 SC 48, it was held:

While appreciating the evidence of a witness the approach must be whether

the evidence of a witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth.

Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the Court to

scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies,

drawbacks and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and

evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor of the

evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of the

evidence is shaken as to tender it unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies

on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach

by taking sentences torn out of context here or there from the evidence,

attaching importance to some technical error committed by the investigating

officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection

of the evidence as a whole.

It is also trite law that a witness may not be able to remember all the intricate

details of an incident that happened some years ago and may not be able to

explain the same in a Court of law due to various factors.

The victim child had been a 9-year-old girl, and she has given evidence in Court

6 years after the incident. It appears from the evidence that since the incidents

of sexual abuse came to light, the victim child has been taken away from her

family and was living in a childrens home, probably under probation care. Being

taken away from her natural environment also may lead to the victim child

forgetting certain details of the incident or incidents and, being more reluctant

to come out of the grave sexual abuse incidents faced by her as a small child. I

find that this is what exactly that has happened in this case.

Page 15 of 20

It was held in the Court of Appeal Case of D. Tikiribanda Vs. The Attorney

General-decided on 06-10-2009 reported in Bar Association Law Reports

2010 (B.L.R.) 92 that;

Mostly the victims of sexual harassment prefer not to talk about the

harrowing experience and would like to forget about the incident as soon as

possible (withdrawal symptom). The offenders should not be allowed to

capitalize or take mean advantage of these natural inherent weaknesses of

small children.

At this stage, I find it appropriate to refer to the Indian case of Bhoginbhai

Hirjibhai Vs State of Gujarat (AIR 1983-SC 753 at pp 756-758) very often

cited in our Courts. It was held:

1) By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape

is replayed on the mental screen.

2) Ordinarily, so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The witness

could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element

of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to be

attuned to absorb the details.

3) Ordinarily, a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the sequence

of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short time span. A

witness is liable to get confused or mixed up when interrogated later on.

4) A witness, though wholly truthful, is liable to be overawed by the Court

atmosphere and the piercing cross-examination made by counsel and out

of nervousness mix up facts, get confused regarding sequence of events,

or fill up details from imagination on the spur of the moment. The sub-

conscious mind of the witness sometime so operates on account of the

fear of looking foolish or being disbelieved though the witnesses is giving

Page 16 of 20

truthful and honest account of the occurrence witnessed by him perhaps

it is a sort of a psychological defense mechanism activated on the spur of

the moment.

The learned High Court Judge in her judgement has well considered whether

there was any unnecessary or unexplained delay in making a proper complaint

to the police in relation to these incidents of grave sexual abuse.

The evidence of the stepfather and that of the mother of the victim child gives a

clear insight as to their circumstances, which led them not to make a complaint

to the police. As I have considered earlier, they have been overdependent on the

appellant and his family. The appellant had been a much more prosperous man

compared to their living standards. Being fearful of the appellant and his family,

the victims stepfather and the mother were planning to leave the area and go

somewhere else rather than confronting the appellant when the police had come

to their house and recorded statements in relation to the grave sexual abuse

incidents.

This very fact shows that the appellants contention that the family of the victim

child was angry with him because he prevented them from plucking produce

from his land has no basis. The appellants contention that he made an indecent

proposal to the mother of the victim and that was the reason why a false

complaint against him was made too has no basis under any circumstance given

the facts and the circumstances that have come to light during the trial.

Although the mother of the child when called by the Court to give evidence has

admitted that in fact the appellant made sexual advances towards her, it appears

that she has done nothing about it due to the very reasons considered earlier.

It was contended that the evidence of the victim child and that of the stepfather

are contradictory to each other in relation to what happened on the day the child

went to the well to fetch water, but the stepfather has given clear evidence when

he went looking for the child, the child was not there and later saw her coming

out of the thicket. He has seen the appellant leaving the same thicket from the

Page 17 of 20

other side. When questioned, the victim child has failed to divulge what

happened initially, but the stepfathers evidence clearly establishes that when he

wanted to punish her, she came up in detail as to what happened to her on that

day. The other incidents of sexual abuse have come to light when the police came

and inquired into this matter.

The victim childs failure to give a definitive date as to the incident faced by her

has to be considered given the relevant facts and circumstances applicable to

the case.

The importance of proving a date mentioned in a charge was sufficiently

discussed in the case of R. Vs. Dossi (1918) 13 Cr.App.R. at 158;

The indictment charged the accused with indecently assaulting an 11-

year-old girl on 19th March 1918. The child gave sworn testimony at the

trial and the trial Judge invoked the rule of practice that it would be

dangerous to convict absent corroboration. The accused provided alibi

evidence for 19th March 1918, but could not do so for any other day in

March. The child gave no evidence of a specific date but referred to

constant acts of indecency over a considerable period of time ending at

some date in March 1918.

The jury found the accused not guilty of the offence on the date alleged.

The Crown then amended the indictment to read on some day in March,

whereupon, the jury found the accused guilty. The conviction was upheld

on appeal,

Per Atkin, J. at page 159;

From time in memorial a date specified in an indictment has never

been a material matter unless it is actually an essential part of the

alleged offence.

Page 18 of 20

He continued at page 160;

Thus, though the date of the offence should be alleged in the

indictment, it has never been necessary that it should be laid

according to truth unless time is of the essence of the offence. It

follows, therefore, that the jury were entitled, if there was evidence

on which they could come to that conclusion, to find the appellant

guilty of the offence charged against him, even though they found that

it had not been committed on the actual date specified in the

indictment.

It is clear from the above authority as well as several other authorities that

followed, the date of the offence need not be proven in order for a conviction to

result, unless time is an essential element of the offence.

In the case of Wright vs. Nicholson 54 Cr. App. R. 38, it was held that the

prosecution should not be allowed to depart from an allegation that an offence

was committed on a particular day in reliance on the principle in Dossi, if there

is a risk that the defendant has been misled as to the allegation he has to answer

or that he would be prejudiced in having to answer a less specific allegation as

to the importance of the provision of such particulars in the context of the right

to fair trial. (Archbold on Criminal Pleading Evidence and Practice 2019, 1-

225 at page 83)

Under the circumstances, it is my considered view that the child initially not

telling before the trial Court that a sexual act was committed on her on the day

referred to by her stepfather would not create a doubt in itself on the evidence of

the victim child or that of the stepfather.

It is well-settled law that evidence in a case has to be taken in its totality be it

the evidence of the prosecution witnesses or that of the defence.

It was held in the case of Don Samantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha Vs. The

Attorney General, C.A. 303/2006 decided on 11-07-2012 that;

Page 19 of 20

Whether the evidence of the defence or the dock statement is sufficient

to create a doubt cannot be decided in a vacuum or in isolation because it

needs to be considered in the totality of evidence that is in the light of the

evidence for the prosecution as well as the defence.

In the Privy Council judgement in Jayasena Vs. Queen 72 NLR 313, it was held:

A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider

all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by

the defence in its totality without compartmentalizing and, ask himself

whether a prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he

believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty.

I am not in a position to agree that the learned High Court Judge failed to

properly analyze the evidence and come to a finding whether the prosecution has

proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. I find that the learned High Court

Judge was very much mindful of the standard of proof in a criminal case when

the evidence placed before the Court was analyzed and come to her conclusions.

I do not find a basis to agree that the learned High Court Judge has failed to

properly analyze the defence evidence and the evidence that favours the

appellant. As I stated above, when considering the evidence in its totality, I find

nothing to conclude that the evidence favours the appellants stand taken at the

trial.

For the reasons considered as above, I find no reasons to interfere with the

conviction of the appellant by the learned trial Judge for the charges preferred

against him.

I do not find reason to believe that the sentence imposed upon the appellant was

excessive given the relevant facts and the circumstances. The evidence provides

a clear insight as to how the appellant used his standing over the victim child

and her family to his advantage in order to commit these offences against the

victim child. Hence, I find no reason to believe that the sentence imposed on the

appellant as excessive.

The appeal is dismissed for want of merit. The conviction and the sentence

affirmed.

However, having considered the fact that the appellant has been in incarceration

from his date of the sentence, namely 28-01-2022, it is directed that the sentence

shall deem to have commenced from his date of the sentence namely, 28-01-

2022.
