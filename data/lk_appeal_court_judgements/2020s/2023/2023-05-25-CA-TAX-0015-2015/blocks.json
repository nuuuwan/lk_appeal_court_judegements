Previously in M.P. Silva v Commissioner of Income Tax (Reports of Ceylon Tax Cases, Vol. 1, page 336 at 338) Canekeratne J. having considered section 74(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance, No. 2 of 1932 held that all questions that could be raised on the whole case was intended to be left open. The learned Judge chose to follow the dicta in Ushers Wilshire Brewery v Bruce [(1915) A.C.. 433 at 465,466]. In Commissioner of Income Tax v. Saverinmuttu Retty {Reports of Ceylon Tax Cases, Vol. 1. Page 103 at 109) Abrahams CJ did make a similar statement by stating Incidently there was no reference to us on the point by the Board of Review, since that point was not put to the Board when they were called upon to adjudicate in appeal, but we are not, of course precluded from considering any point upon which the actual decision of the Board might be upheld, no matter what might have been their reasons for arriving at that decision.",

The courts have considered the far reaching arbitrary powers granted to an Assessor under the existing law in several cases and have from time to time commented on the improper approach made by assessors in exercising those powers. The areas of dispute between an assessor and assessee would necessarily revolve around the reasons of the Assessor for, and the basis of his making the arbitrary assessment of income or wealth. But the assessee was completely in the dark in regard to the reasons or basis for not accepting the return even when the notice of assessment was served on him under section 95. An assessee, when he filed his appeal could therefore not formulate his grounds of appeal except in general terms. However, under the provisions dealing with the,appeal in section 97 (2) he was obliged to set out the precise grounds of such appeal and",

When the Assessor did form such a judgment, the burden is shifted on the assessee to displace the assessment he had decided to make, according to his judgment.

Under the amendment when an Assessor does not accept a return, it must mean that at the relevant point of time he has brought his mind to bear on the return and has come to a decision rejecting the return. Consequent to this rejection, the reasons must be communicated to the assessee. The provisions for the giving of reasons and the written communication of the reasons, contained in the amendment is to ensure that in fact the new procedure would be followed. More particularly, the communication of the reason at the relevant time is the indication of its compliance. The new procedure would also have the effect of fixing the Assessor to a definite position and not give him the latitude to chop and change thereafter. It was therefore essential that an Assessor who rejects a return should state his reasons and communicate them. His reasons must be communicated at or about the time he sends his assessment on an estimated income. Any later communication would defeat the remedial action intended by the amendment (emphasis added). (Emphasis added). [45] Samarakoon C.J. held, at p. 242:",

Sub-section (5) of section 74 requires the Court to hear and determine any questions of law arising in the stated case and not any question or questions formulated by the Board. The function of the Board is to set forth the facts and the decision of the Board and not to formulate as it has done in this case specific questions to be answered by this Court. The present practice is likely to result in a party being stated out of Court, [109] As noted, Abrahams C.J. stated in Commissioner of Income Tax v.",

In view of the said conclusion, there is no necessity to address the other questions of law in the case stated. I direct the tax Appeals Commission to accept the notice of assessment and decide the appeal on merits. [138] That case was appealed to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court in SC (Spl) L.A.

He may, or may not, do so as an administrative act. The Assessor may, or may not, obey. The Assessee is powerless to enforce the execution of such administrative acts.
