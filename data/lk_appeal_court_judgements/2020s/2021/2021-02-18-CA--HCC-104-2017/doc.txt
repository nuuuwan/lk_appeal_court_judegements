P.Kumararatnam,J

Counsel : Anil silva PC with S.Kulathunga for the Accused- Appellant Chethiya Gunasekara, DSG for the AG Written Submissions on : 04.04.2018 and 03.06.2020 (by the Accused-appellant) 04.06.2018 (by the Complainant Respondent) Argued On : 19.01.2021 Decided On : 18.02.2021 ******************** Devika Abeyratne,J

The accused appellant in this case was charged with having

committed the murder of Rankoth Pedige Pieris an offence punishable

under section 296 of the Penal Code and he was also charged in the

3

course of the same transaction with having made an attempt to commit

the robbery of a gold chain an offence punishable under Section 381 of

the Penal Code.

At the end of the trial, the learned High Court Judge found the

accused appellant guilty of both charges and sentenced him to death in

respect of the first count and imposed a sentence of 2 years rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5000/- with a default sentence of 03

months of imprisonment in respect of the second count.

It is against the said conviction and sentence the accused

appellant has preferred this appeal.

At the trial, the prosecution led the evidence of six witnesses of

whom, PW 01 Sachindra Nirmani Ariyaratne the grand daughter of the

deceased is the purported eye witness to the incident.

The conviction and sentence were contested mainly on the ground

that there was no identification of the accused and that as per the

medical evidence, whether the cause of death was purely due to the stab

injury. or whether the heart and lung condition of the deceased

attributed to his death. Further, it was contended that inadmissible

evidence which was obnoxious to section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance

regarding a recovery of a weapon by the accused appellant and evidence

of bad character where evidence was led that the accused was arrested

for housebreaking which is in addition to the charge referred to in the

4

indictment, has been allowed by the learned trial judge, thus, the

accused was deprived of a fair trial.

The factual circumstances are briefly as follows;

According to PW 01, on the day in question 12.02.2009, she was

at home with her mother and the grandparents studying around 8 pm

at night when she heard someone talking outside the house and after

informing the mother and switching on all the lights around the house,

she has gone out of the house with her mother with her grand father

who is now deceased following them. She has observed a person seated

under the lime tree who had then come out, showing some card

purporting to be an identity card saying, "

".

That person has at first held her mother by the collar of her blouse

and thereafter, had grabbed the chain the witness was wearing, when

her grand father hit the intruder with the torch he was carrying and

the witness who fell at that point was helped up by her mother. The

man had then run away without the chain, and the witness and her

mother had run inside the house. Then she had seen the grandfather

holding on to his stomach in pain, and when inquired, has stated "

". At the Anuradhapura hospital he has

succumbed to his injuries.

The witness has admitted that she did not recognize the intruder

on the night of the incident, however, had identified him at the

identification parade held at the Thambuththegama Magistrates Court

approximately one year later and also in the Dock, at the trial.

5

In cross examination she has admitted not seeing the grand father

being stabbed, but has testified that there was only one person at the

scene of the incident and that person was the accused who she

identified as the person who tried to rob her chain and stabbed the

grandfather.

The witness has been questioned at length about the identification

of the accused and it has been suggested by the counsel for the accused,

that the witness has been shown the accused/ his photograph by the

Police, prior to the identification parade. This suggestion she has

vehemently denied.

At the hearing of the appeal the learned Presidents Counsel made

a valiant attempt to convince court that there is no reliable

identification of the accused by the main witness PW 01 especially as

the alleged incident would not have taken much time, and that the

principle enunciated in Regina vs Turnbull should be applied on the

basis that in the absence of any corroboration regarding the

identification of the assailant, it is unsafe to act on the evidence of PW

01.

The identification parade was held on 22.03.2019, more than a

year after the alleged incident and the learned Presidents Counsel

referred to the following authorities in the Indian Supreme Court and

the decision in Ranamuka Arachchilage Chaminda Roshan vs The

Attorney-General CA 120/ 2014 decided on 14.09.2011, to support his

argument.

6

In Chaminda Roshans case, Court held that the identification

parade, if it is to be of value, must be held at the earliest opportunity,

and rejected the identification parade, stating that there is no plausible

reason adduced holding the identification parade 50 days after the

event and on the ability of the complainant to make a genuine

identification.

In Daya Singhe Vs. State of Haryana the Indian Supreme Court

dealing with the holding of an Identification Parade belatedly has

held ;

At this stage we would first refer to the decisions upon which

reliance is placed. In the case of Soni Vs State UP (1982)3 SC

368, this court observed that delay of 42 days in holding the

identification parade throws doubt on genuineness thereof.

Apart from the fact that it is difficult that after a lapse of such

a long time the witnesses would be remembering facial

expression of the appellant.

In Harinnath and another Vs State of UP AIR 1988 SC 345

the Court observed that evidence of test identification is

admissible under section 09 of the Evidence Act. But the

value of test identification, apart from the other safeguards

appropriate for a fair test identification depends upon the

Promptitude in point of time with which the suspected persons

are put up for test identification. If there is an unexplained

and unreasonable delay in putting up the accused persons for

a test identification, the delay by itself detracts from the

credibility of the test. The court further referred to (para 9)

7

Prof. Borchards convicting the innocent of the basis of error

in identification of the accused the learned author has

observed the emotional balance of the victim or eye witness

by his extraordinary experience that his powers of perception

become distorted and his identification frequently most

untrustworthy. In to the identification enter other motives not

necessarily stimulated originally by the accused personally,

the desire to requite a crime, to exact vengeance upon the

person believed guilty, to find a scapegoat, to support

consciously or unconsciously an identification already made

by another. Thus doubts are resolved against the accused.

Relying on the above authorities the learned President s Counsel

contended that the delay in holding the identification parade after one

year, a reasonable doubt is created in the identification and it was

unsafe to rely on that evidence.

The evidence of PW 01 is that she identified the accused as the

person who tried to rob her chain and as the person who stabbed the

deceased. The evidence led was that they switched on all the lights

before leaving the house. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the area

was well illuminated. The accused was first sighted under the lime tree,

then he had come forward to show his identity card and asking the

mother not to shout. He had first grabbed the collar of the mothers

blouse, thereafter, the chain that the witness was wearing. When the

sequence of events is considered, although it may have been a traumatic

situation, there was sufficient time for the witness to have a close look

at the accused. It is obvious from the evidence, that the face of the

accused was uncovered and was at arms length of the witness as he

8

was grabbing her chain. According to the evidence, PW 1 became aware

of the injury to the grand father after the intruder ran away. There is

no reason to believe that this young witness did not gain an enduring

impression of the intruder.

In Roshan Vs Attorney General Supra has referred to the necessity

of holding an identification parade at the earliest opportunity and has

also referred to the importance of the quality of the evidence.

(emphasis added)

In Dayanada Lokugalappatthi and eight others v The State, [2003]

3 SLR 362 at 390, R V Turnbull (C.A), [1977] 1 Q.B 224 at page 228 also

refers to the factors that are relevant to be considered when

determining the quality of evidence and that these factors could vary

according to the facts and circumstances of each case.

Rathnasingham Janushan and Benedict Wesley Abraham V OIC,

Jaffna (SC (Spl) Appeal No. 07/2018- Decided on 04.10.2019) his

Lordship Jayantha Jayasuriya CJ has held as follows.

To establish the identify of an accused, it is not mandatory the

witness should have known him by his name or otherwise,

prior to the incident. Even in a situation where a witness had

seen a person at an incident for the first time, his evidence in

court identifying the accused in the dock as the person whom

he saw at the incident should not be rejected merely because

the witness had neither seen him before nor had known his

9

name prior to the incident. A Dock identification is a valid

form of identification.

In Raja V State by the Inspector of Police (Criminal Appeal No.

740 of 2018- 10.12.2019) ( Indian Supreme Court) ..It is

neither possible nor prudent to lay down any invariable rule as

to the period within which a test identification parade must be

held, or the number of witnesses who must correctly identify

the accused, to sustain his conviction. These matters must be

left to the courts of fact to decide in the facts and circumstances

of each case. If a rule is laid down prescribing a period within

which the test parade must be held. It would only benefit the

professional criminals in whose cases the arrests are delayed

as the police have no clear clue about their identity, they being

persons unknown to the victims..

In the instant case the accused was unknown to the victims. It

appears that the police had taken time to arrest the accused and after

the arrest, without any further delay, has taken steps to hold the

identification parade. Therefore, the delay in holding the identification

parade in this case is explained and as PW 1 had clearly identified the

accused appellant as the person who attempted to rob her chain and

stabbed her grand father, the principle in Chaminda Roshans case

regarding the delay does not apply to the instant case. However, as far

as the quality of evidence is concerned, the evidence of PW 1 is

convincing and consistent.

10

The identification parade notes were marked as P8 without further

proof. The learned trial judge at no point has come to a finding that the

identification parade was conducted in an un unfair manner.

Furthermore, the following order dated 28.09.2015 in page 44 of

the brief is of much relevance. (emphasis added in the order)

Therefore, it is apparent that the appellant who has not challenged

the identification parade and voluntarily conceding that he was

identified at the identification parade at the trial, cannot now be allowed

to challenge his identification at the appeal stage.

Further, the above quoted authorities reiterate that there has to

be an assessment on the quality of the evidence when it is to be decided

whether the identity of the accused has been proved or not.

It is also significant to note that in the Dock statement of the

accused, although there was ample opportunity to appraise Court, that

he was pointed out to the witnesses prior to holding of the identification

parade or that it was conducted in an unfair manner, he has failed to

do so.

11

Therefore, considering the evidence adduced before Court, there

is no reason to believe that the evidence of PW1 who identified the

accused at the identification parade should be disbelieved. It is also not

established that she has seen either the accused or his photograph prior

to the identification parade as suggested by the counsel for the accused.

Considering all of the above, this Court is of the opinion that the

evidence of PW 01 has clearly established without a doubt, the identity

of the accused. Therefore, the learned trial judges conclusion that the

witness evidence that she identified the accused can be believed, even

though the identification parade was held almost an year later after the

alleged incident. Thus, the argument of the learned Presidents Counsel

that the accused was not identified by the witness is not tenable.

With regard to the cause of death the argument for the defense

was on the basis that the cause of death should be proved beyond

reasonable doubt and as per the evidence of PW 7 Dr Jayasena in page

82 of the brief, the medical evidence refers to two possible causes of

death as the deceased was suffering from a heart ailment and thus, a

doubt is created whether a charge of murder could be sustained.

It is correct that PW 7 has mentioned bleeding which would have

been caused by injury by a weapon with a sharp edge and that the

weakness of the heart and lung along with excessive bleeding could

have contributed to the death.

12

At page 79 of the brief PW 7 has explained the injuries, that the

stab wound has made the large bowel to protrude and that it has

penetrated the soft tissues and muscles of the anterior abdominal wall,

peritoneum, omental fat, anterior and posterior wall of the stomach

cystic artery (artery supplying the gall bladder), hepatic vein and the

undersurface of the liver. According to the post mortem report the cause

of death is stated as follows;

1a. Haemorrhage and Shock.

1b. Single stab injury to the abdomen

2 . Ischaemic heart disease, chronic lung disease.

Therefore, although there may have been a possibility of an

operation saving the deceased if it was done within a specific time, it

was established that the excessive bleeding was due to the injuries

caused by a sharp weapon that was inflicted by the accused. The fact

that the deceased had a weak heart and lungs is secondary. As such, I

am of the considered view that the argument advanced by the learned

Presidents Counsel on that point is not tenable.

With regard to the ground of appeal that the accused appellant

was denied a fair trial, it is abundantly clear that the evidence referred

to by the learned Presidents Counsel as detrimental to the appellant,

was due to the questions posed by the defense Counsel at the trial and

thus, cannot be attributed to the prosecution. However, it is apparent

from the reasoning in the Judgment, that the learned trial judge has

not considered that evidence to come to his finale conclusion.

13

It was also contended by the counsel for the appellant that the

alleged statement " "is not admissible as a dying

declaration, as that statement should relate to the death of the deceased

and in the given circumstances of this case, as the deceased was

suffering from a heart ailment the cause of death was not proved beyond

reasonable doubt. As stated earlier in this judgment this Court has

affirmed the conclusion of the trial judge that death was caused by the

injury inflicted by the accused, who is the person referred to as "

" therefore, the argument of the Presidents Counsel on this point

also fails.

In the Dock Statement, the accused appellant has merely denied

any involvement in the incident and had merely stated he had been

arrested on information given by one Asanka.

It is apparent that the learned trial judge has assessed and

evaluated the evidence before Court in the correct perspective.

The totality of the evidence led in the case leads to an inescapable

and irresistible inference and conclusion that it was the accused

appellant who inflicted the injuries stated earlier and there is no doubt

that death was caused by heavy bleeding which culminated in his death

and that it was the accused who attempted to rob the chain PW 01 was

wearing.

For the reasons stated above, I find no justification to interfere

with the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of Anuradhapura

14

dated 10.07.2017. Accordingly, I affirm the conviction and the sentence

and dismiss the appeal.
