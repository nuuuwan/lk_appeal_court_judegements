This is plainly incorrect since the letter of intimation had already been sent, and since the reasons for not accepting the return of the taxpayer have not been mentioned in these notices. Such errors are not only embarrassing to behold, but bring unnecessary litigation before the Courts. Nevertheless, I cannot hold that the said error acts to invalidate the assessment notices altogether.

The reason why the former is the wrong question is that it leaves the real issue unresolved; whether there is a single or a multiple supply. The proper inquiry is whether one element of the transaction is so dominated by another element as to lose any separate identity as a supply for fiscal purposes, leaving the latter, the dominant element of the transaction, as the only supply. If the elements of the transaction were not in this relationship with each other, each remains as a supply in its own right with its own separate fiscal consequences. In determining whether what would otherwise be two supplies should be regarded as a single supply the court has to ask itself whether one element is an integral part of the other, or is ancillary or incidental to the other; or whether the two elements are physically and economically dissociable. This, however, merely replaces one question with the other. In order to answer this further question, the court must consider what is the true and substantial nature of the consideration given for the payment. There are, however, limits to this process. Where supplies are made by different suppliers, they cannot be fused together to make a single; and it is probably only in relatively simple transactions that the reductions of multiple to single supplies is appropriate.",

Even if old rubber trees and other live trees were not waste products, they simply cannot come under the provision of agricultural products, as a crop is cultivated in order to produce some product such as food or industrial products/raw materials such as rubber latex. The tree itself cannot be construed to be the product of the crop, other than perhaps trees grown specifically to be used as timber, which the Appellant strongly insists its sale should not be classified under.",
