containing in extent of 7 acres 1 rood and 30.3 perches.

10 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

Background to the Appeal

The summary of the Plaintiffs Case

[4] The Plaintiff pleaded in the Plaint inter alia, that:

i. Dikwella Vidanage Niculas Appu became the original owner of the

land sought to be partitioned by virtue of the Final Decree entered

in the District Court of Tangalle Partition Case bearing No. 4726

(P1);

ii. The said Dikwella Vidanage Niculas Appu who married to

Ahangama Lanka Geeganage Wimalawathie Gajanayake had no

children and expired on 31.10.1963 leaving behind his wife and

four siblings, namely, Dikwella Vidanage Punchihamy, Dikwella

Vidanage Nonahamy, Dikwella Vidanage Charlinahamy and

Dikwella Vidanage Didereus;

iii. Upon the demise of the said Dikwella Vidanage Niculas Appu, a

Testamentary Case bearing No. T 52 was filed in the District Court

of Tangalle and the estate of the said Dikwella Vidanage Niculas

Appu was administrated in the said Testamentary Case;

iv. While the said Testamentary Case was pending in the District

Court of Tangalle, it was revealed that the said Dikwella Vidanage

Niculas Appu and his wife, namely, the said Ahangama Lanka

Geeganage Wimalawathie Gajanayake, by Deed No. 1232 dated

02.12.1962 had allegedly gifted the subject-matter of this action to

one Sudusinghe Sirisena (the 10th Defendant);

v. Upon the said revelation, the 4 heirs of the said Dikwella Vidanage

Niculas Appu, namely Dikwella Vidanage Jardiyes, Dikwella

Vidanage Punchihamy, Dikwella Vidanage Nonahamy, Dikwella

Vidanage Charlinahamy instituted an action in the District Court of

11 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

Tangalle bearing Case No. 324/L for the cancellation of the said

Deed No. 1232;

vi. The District Court of Tangalle in its judgment dated 27.02.1973

cancelled the said Deed and the appeal filed against the said

judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 13.12.1979 and

thus, the 10th Defendant was not entitled to any right in the subject

matter of this action;

vii. Upon the demise of the said Dikwella Vidanage Punchihamy, her

rights devolved on her children, namely, the 2nd Defendant,

Colombage Santis and Colombage Meurin alias Wimalawathie

who by Deed No. 2160 (2D1) sold their rights to the 2nd

Defendant;

viii. Upon the demise of the said Dikwella Vidanage Nonahamy, her

rights devolved on her three children, namely, Johana Weeratunga

alias Podihamy, David Weeratunga (the 7th Defendant), Disneris

alias Don Bastian Weeratunga (the 8th Defendant);

ix. The said Johana Weeratunga alias Podihamy by Deed No. 810

dated 25.06.1981 conveyed her 1/24 share to the Plaintiff and the

said Dikwella Vidanage Charlinahamy Ukku by Deed No. 2154

dated 21.03.1981 conveyed her rights to the 2nd Defendant and

upon the demise of the said Dikwella Vidanage Didereus, his rights

devolved on his 5 children, namely, the Plaintiff, the 3rd to 6th

Defendants;

x. The said Ahangama Lanka Geeganage Wimalawathie Gajanayake

who became entitled to share of the subject-matter, by Deed No.

707 dated 12.03.1980 (1D1) transferred her share to the 1st

Defendant who by Deed No. 708 dated 03.12.1980 transferred

undivided 1/6 share to the Plaintiff;

12 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

xi. Upon a search made at the Land Registry, it was found that the

widow of the said Niculas Appu, the said Ahangama Lanka

Geeganage Wimalawathie Gajanayake by Deed No. 162 dated

23.06.1981 had transferred the entire subject matter of the action to

the 9th Defendant. However, the 9th Defendant could not have

claimed any such right in the subject matter of this action.

[5] Accordingly, the Plaintiff claimed that the parties are entitled

undivided rights in the following manner:

The Plaintiff 1/6 + 1/24+1/40 - undivided 28/120

The 1st Defendant 2/6 - undivided 40/120

The 2nd Defendant 3/24 + 1/8 - undivided 30/120

The 3rd Defendant 1/40 - undivided 3/120

The 4th Defendant 1/40 - undivided 3/120

The 5th Defendant 1/40 - undivided 3/120

The 6th Defendant 1/40 - undivided 3/120

The 7th Defendant 1/24 - undivided 5/120

The 8th Defendant 1/24 - undivided 5/120

[6] The 2nd Defendant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd

Defendant) filed statement of claim and claimed his undivided rights as

pleaded in the Plaint.

[7] The 9th Defendant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 9th

Defendant) filed statement of claim and while admitting paragraphs 1-6

of the Plaint denied that the 1st Defendant was entitled to undivided rights

on Deed No. 707. The 9th Defendant further stated that Wimalawathie

Gallage by Deed No. 1627 dated 23.06.1981 transferred her undivided

share to him and claimed that he was entitled to undivided of the land

sought to be partitioned.

13 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

[8] The 10th Defendant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 10th

Defendant) filed statement of claim and whilst denying that the said

Wimalawathie Gajanayake by Deed No. 707 transferred undivided

share of the said land to the 1st Defendant claimed that he possessed the

land depicted in Plan No. 154 for more than 10 years and acquired

prescriptive right to the same;

[9] The 11th Defendant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 11th

Defendant) filed statement of claim denying the pedigree pleaded in the

Plaint and claimed that the said Dikwella Vidanage Nonahamy had 4

children and one of her children, namely Anagihamy is his wife. He

claimed that the rights of the said Anigahamy devolved on him and her 7

children.

[10] The 12th Defendant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 12th

Defendant) filed statement of claim and stated inter alia, that her

deceased husband, Gunapala was the tenant cultivator of Lots 1 and 3

depicted in Plan No. 154 and that upon his demise, she cultivated the said

Lots as the tenant cultivator. She further claimed that her husband

Gunapala built a thatched house, planted trees and acquired prescriptive

title to Lot 4 depicted in Plan No. 154 by undisturbed and uninterrupted

possession for over a period of 10 years. She sought a declaration that she

is the tenant cultivator of Lot 1 and 3 depicted in Plan No. 154 and that

she had acquired prescriptive title to Lot 4 depicted in the said Plan.

[11] The 13th Defendant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 13th

Defendant) filed statement of claim and stated inter alia, that in 1955, he

obtained possession of Lot 2 depicted in Plan No. 154 from the original

owner Niculas Appu and thereafter, he planted all 20 coconut trees and

acquired prescriptive title to Lot 2 depicted in Plan No. 154 by

undisturbed and uninterrupted possession for a period of over 10 years.

14 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

The 13th Defendant further claimed that he is the tenant cultivator of the

paddy land in extent of 3 acres and sought an order to exclude Lot 2

depicted in Plan No. 154 from the corpus of the action on the basis of his

prescriptive rights. He further sought a declaration that he is the tenant

cultivator of the paddy land in extent of 3 acres.

Admissions & Main Issues before the District Court

[12] There was no dispute with regard to the corpus of the action and the

dispute was only in respect of the rights of the parties. At the

commencement of the trial on 03.11.1987, 21 points of contest were

raised on behalf of the contested parties and thereafter, the original

Plaintiff commenced his evidence and the trial was postponed for various

reasons. When the case was taken up for trial on 07.03.1989, the Court

was informed that the original Plaintiff had passed away and accordingly,

the Substituted Plaintiff was appointed in place of the deceased original

Plaintiff.

[13] When the case was taken up for trial on 26.02.1990, the following

two admissions were recorded by the parties:

1. The corpus of the action is properly depicted as Lots 1-5 in the

Preliminary Plan No. 154 dated 05.04.1983 made by J. G.

Amadoru, Licensed Surveyor;

2. The original owner of the land sought to be partitioned was

Dikwella Vidanage Niculas Appu.

[14] Of consent, fresh points of contest were raised on behalf of the

Substituted-Plaintiff and the 9th to 13th Defendants and accordingly, the

case proceeded to trial on 17 points of contest. The main issues before the

District Court were as follows:

15 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

1. Whether the rights of the said Dikwella Vidanage Niculas Appu

devolved on the parties according to the pedigree pleaded in the

Plaint;

2. Whether the said Wimalawathie Gajanayake by Deed No. 1627

dated 23.01.1981 transferred her undivided share of the subject

matter to the 9th Defendant;

3. Whether the 10th Defendant had undisturbed and uninterrupted

possession of the land in dispute for a period of over 10 years and

acquired prescriptive title to the same;

4. Whether the 12th Defendant is the tenant cultivator of the paddy

lands depicted as Lots 1 and 3 in Plan No. 154 and the 13th

Defendant is the tenant cultivator of the paddy land in extent of 3

acres;

5. Whether the 12th Defendant and the 13th Defendant had undisturbed

and uninterrupted possession of the Lot 4 and 2 respectively, for a

period of over 10 years and acquired prescriptive title to the same.

Judgment of the District Court [15] After trial, the learned Additional District Judge of Hambantota by

judgment dated 25.01.1999 held that:

(i) The Plaintiff has established the pedigree pleaded in the Plaint;

(ii) Deed No. 1627 dated 23.01.1981 (9V1) had been duly registered in

the Land Registry in the correct folio whereas Deed No. 707 dated

12.03.1980 (1V1) had not been registered in the Land Registry and

accordingly, the 1st Defendant could not have claimed undivided

share of the land on Deed No. 707 dated 12.03.1980 (1D1);

16 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

(iii) The 9th Defendant had duly purchased undivided share of the land

from Wimalawathie Gajanayake on Deed No. 1627 dated 23.07.1981

(9V1) and thus, the 9th Defendant is entitled to undivided share of

the land sought to be partitioned;

(iv) The Plaintiff who had claimed that he derived undivided 1/6 share of

the land on Deed No. 708 dated 03.11.1980 (P3) is not entitled to the

said undivided 1/6 share of the subject matter of the action from

Wimalawathie Gajanayake;

(v) Although the said Niculas Appu and Wimalawathie Gajanayake were

said to have gifted the land in dispute to the 10th Defendant on Deed

No. 1232 dated 02.12.1962 (P13), the said Deed had been cancelled

by the judgment dated 27.02.1973 of the District Court of Tangalle

Case bearing No. 324/L and the appeal filed against the said

judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 13.12.1979;

(vi) As the 10th Defendant had claimed that he took over the possession of

the land in dispute after the demise of Niculas Appu in 1963, the

continuity of his possession was interrupted with the filing of the

District Court Case bearing No. 324/L on 19.04.1971. As the appeal

was finally decided on 13.12.1979 against the 10th Defendant and this

action was filed on 05.01.1982, the 10th Defendant could not have

proved uninterrupted possession for a period of 10 years;

(vii) Although the 12th and the 13th Defendants had claimed that they

were the tenant cultivators of the paddy lands under the 10th

Defendants, the 10th Defendant was not the owner of the paddy land

in question and thus, the 12th and 13th Defendant could not have been

declared as tenant cultivators of the paddy lands in question;

17 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

(viii) The 12th and the 13th Defendants have, however, established that

they had undisturbed and uninterrupted possession of Lots 4 and 2

respectively in Plan No. 154 and acquired prescriptive title to the said

Lots and thus, the said Lots 2 and 4 depicted in Plan No. 154 ought to

be excluded from the corpus of the action.

[16] Having accepted the Plaintiffs pedigree subject to the rights of the

9th Defendant, the learned Additional District Judge by his judgment

dated 25.01.1999 excluded Lots Nos. 2 and 4 from the corpus of the

action. Accordingly, after excluding the said Lots 2 from the corpus of

the action, the 9th Defendant was declared entitled to share of the

corpus of the action and following parties were declared entitled to the

balance portion of the corpus in the following manner:

The Plaintiff - undivided 20/120

The 2nd Defendant - undivided 30/120

The 3rd Defendant - undivided 3/120

The 4th Defendant - undivided 3/120

The 5th Defendant - undivided 3/120

The 6th Defendant - undivided 3/120

The 7th Defendant - undivided 5/120

The 8th Defendant - undivided 5/120

[17] The 12th and the 13th Defendants were also declared entitled to the

buildings, improvements and plantation in Lots 4 and 2 respectively,

depicted in Plan No. 154.

Appeals filed against the Judgment of the District Court

[18] Aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned Additional District

Judge of Hambantota, the Substituted-Plaintiff-Appellant and the 12th

Defendant-Appellant have preferred two appeals to this Court.

18 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

Appeal filed by the 12th Defendant-Appellant (Appeal bearing No.

CA 524/99 (F))

[19] When this matter was mentioned on 16.10.2020, the learned

Presidents Counsel for the 12th Defendant-Appellant in Appeal bearing

No. 524/99 (F) submitted that in view of the fact that the learned

Additional District Judge had answered the points of contest No. 9 in

favour of the 12th Defendant, the 12th Defendant did not pursue the

Appeal bearing No. 524/99 (F). He submitted that accordingly, the 12th

Defendant-Appellant does not intend to pursue the Appeal filed by the

12th Defendant and invited this Court not to consider the Appeal filed by

the 12th Defendant together with the Appeal No. 524A/99 filed by the

Substituted-Plaintiff-Appellant. Accordingly, I shall confine this

judgment to the Appeal filed by the Substituted-Plaintiff-Appellant

bearing No. 524A/99 (F).

Appeal filed by the Substituted-Plaintiff-Appellant (Appeal No. CA 524A/99 (F)) & Submissions made on behalf of the Substituted-Plaintiff-Appellant

[20] When this Appeal bearing No. 524A/99 (f) filed by the Substituted-

Plaintiff-Appellant was taken up for hearing on 18.02.2010, Mr.

Shayamal Collure relied on the following three grounds of Appeal:

1. Once issues are framed, they cannot be struck out or left

unanswered, but the learned Additional District Judge has erred in

not answering the points of contest raised by the parties on

03.11.1987;

2. The learned Additional District Judge has erred in excluding Lots 2

and 4 depicted in Plan No. 154 from the corpus of the action on the

ground of prescription;

19 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

3. The findings of the learned Additional District Judge that the 9th

Defendants Deed No. 1627 dated 23.07.1981 (9V1) gives priority

over the Deed No. 707 dated 12.03.1980 (1V1) on the basis that the

said Deed No. 707 marked 1V1 had not been registered in the

correct folio is erroneous.

[21] Mr. Collure however, brought to the attention of Court that as the 9th

Defendant is absent and unrepresented at the hearing, the determination

of his third ground of appeal on prior registration will affect the rights of

the 9th Defendant and thus, he moved for time to consider the question

whether or not he should proceed with his third ground of Appeal on

prior registration.

[22] On 05.03.2010, Mr. Collure submitted that as the 9th Defendant is

absent and unrepresented and that every effort made by him to find the

whereabout of the 9th Defendant or his heirs, was unsuccessful, he wished

to forgo his third ground of appeal on prior registration. Mr. Collure

restricted his grounds of appeal and submissions on the issue of

prescription (ground of appeal No. 2) and thus, all Counsel invited this

Court to fix the matter for judgment reserving their right to file further

written submissions in the Registry after taking steps for substitution in

respect of the deceased 7th Defendant-Respondent.

[23] This case was fully argued before a Bench comprising Justice Shiran

Gooneratne and myself and upon an application being made by the

learned Counsel for the Substituted-Plaintiff to take steps for substitution

in respect of the deceased 1st Defendant-Respondent, this Court issued

notice on the proposed party to be substituted in place of the deceased 1st

Defendant-Respondent and as he was absent and unrepresented on

12.01.2021, this Court made order substituting the 1A Defendant-

Respondent in place of the deceased 1A Defendant-Respondent.

20 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

[24] As Justice Shiran Gooneratne has been elevated to the Supreme

Court, this Court on 19.01.2021, inquired from the Attorneys-at-law for

the Substituted-Plaintiff, the 12th and the 13A Defendants whether they

wished to re-argue this matter before the present Bench. All three

attorneys-at-law, representing the Substituted-Plaintiff, the 12th and the

13A Defendants invited the present Bench comprising the remaining

Judge before whom also the case was fully argued, to deliver the

judgment upon the written submissions filed by the parties without any

further re-argument.

Issue on Appeal

[25] In view of the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the

Substituted-Plaintiff on 05.03.2010 restricting the grounds of Appeal to

the issue of prescriptive rights of the 12th and the 13th Defendants, the

only matter for decision is whether the 12th and the 13th Defendants had

acquired a prescriptive title to Lot 4 and 2 respectively depicted in Plan

No. 154 marked X.

Decision

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance

[26] A perusal of the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of

Hambantota reveals that he has accepted the Plaintiffs pedigree subject

to the rights of the 9th Defendant and allotted undivided rights to the

parties accordingly. It is not in dispute that the parties who were allotted

shares had derived their rights from the original owner, namely, Dikwella

Vidanage Niculas Appu. The 12th and the 13th Defendants did not dispute

the paper title of the heirs of the said Niculas Appu and they only invoked

the provisions of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to

21 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

defeat the ownership of the said heirs of Niculas Appu to the land in

dispute.

[27] Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance No. 22 of 1871 reads as follows:

Proof of the undisturbed and uninterrupted possession by a defendant in any action, or by those under whom he claims, of lands or immovable property, by a title adverse to or independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff in such action (that is to say, a possession unaccompanied by payment of rent or produce, or performance of service or duty, or by any other act by the possessor, from which an acknowledgment of a right existing in another person would fairly and naturally be inferred) for ten years previous to the bringing of such action, shall entitle the defendant to a decree in his favour with costs....

[28] It is settled law that the person who claims prescriptive title to a

defined block of land is obliged to prove that he had an exclusive

possession and acquired prescriptive title without any interruption well

over a period of 10 years (Alwis v. Piyasena Perera 1993 (1) SLR 119).

Under the law, possession relied upon in support of a prescriptive title is

required to be by a title adverse to or independent of that of the claimant

or the plaintiff in the action. Accordingly, the three elements that are set

out in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance for the proof of prescriptive

title are:

1. the undisturbed and uninterrupted possession;

2. the adverse to or independent possession; and

3. period of ten years previous to the bringing of such action [29] Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance contains a parenthetical

clause which is intended to explain the character of the possession which,

if held adversely to the owner of the land (adverse possession) for ten

22 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

years, will result in prescription. As noted, the parenthetical clause in

section 3 reads thus,

that is to say, a possession unaccompanied by payment of rent or produce or performance of service or duty or by any other act by the possessor, from which an acknowledgement of a right existing in another person would fairly and naturally be inferred.

[30] As regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, it is apt to

refer to the following passage from Walter Pereira s Laws of Ceylon, 2nd

Edition, page 396:

As regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere general statements of witnesses that the plaintiff possessed the land in dispute for a number of years exceeding the prescriptive period are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse possession necessary to support a title by prescription. It is necessary that the witness should speak to specific facts, and the question of possession has to be decided thereupon by Court

[31] In Kirihamy Muhandiram v. Dingiri Appu 6 NLR 200, Moncreiff J. stated:

It would appear then that, in order that a person may avail himself of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, No. 22 of 1871-

(1) Possession must be shown from which a right in another person

cannot be fairly or naturally inferred;

(2) Possession required by the section must be shown on the part of

the party litigating or by those under whom he claims;

(3) The possession of those under whom the party claims means

possession by his predecessors in title;

(4) judgment must be for a person who is a party to the action and

not for one who sets up the possession of another person, who is neither his predecessor in title nor a person to the action. [32] The burden of proof of a person who invokes the provisions of

section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership

23 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

of an adverse claimant, rests squarely and fairly on him to establish a

starting point for his or her acquisition of prescriptive rights (Chelliah v.

Wijenathan, 54 NLR 337 & 342 & Sirajudeen v. Abbas 1994 (2) SLR

365).

Commencement of possession by the 12th and the 13th Defendants

[33] The learned Presidents Counsel for the 12th Defendant, Mr.

Kariapper has submitted that the learned Additional District Judge has

clearly come to the conclusion that the 12th Defendant having initially

come to the land in dispute as a tenant cultivator and thereafter possessed

the land from 1963 upto the point of the filing of the action in 1982

adversely to all the others without paying a single rental to any person

and acquired prescriptive title to the same. He has further submitted that

after her husbands death in 1982, she continued to possess and occupy

the house on Lot 4 while cultivating Lots 1 and 3 and acquired

prescriptive title to Lot 4 depicted in Plan No. 154 by undisturbed and

uninterrupted possession adversely to the Plaintiff, the 10th Defendant and

all others.

[34] The learned Counsel for the 13A Defendant has submitted in the

written submissions filed on behalf of the 13A Defendant that although

the 13th Defendant entered upon the land in 1955 under Niculas Appu, he

commenced possession adversely to all the others in Lot 2 for a period of

over 10 years and acquired prescriptive title to the same while cultivating

an extent of 3 acres in the paddy land as a tenant cultivator.

[35] As noted, there is no dispute among the parties with regard to the

subject-matter of the action. The Preliminary Plan No. 154 dated

05.04.1983 made by J. G. Amadoru, Licensed Surveyor reveals that the

corpus consists of 5 Lots as follows:

24 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

Lot No Extent Nature

A. R. P.

1 0 1 4.5 Paddy land

2 1 0 11.8 Highland

3 5 1 19.5 Paddy land

4 0 2 12.5 High land

5 0 0 22.0 Paddy land

________________________________________________________

7 1 30.3

[36] Although the 12th Defendant has stated in her statement of claim that

she entered upon the land in dispute in 1938 and had undisturbed and

uninterrupted possession adversely to all the others, her evidence was that

Lots 1 and 3 in Plan No. 154 were handed over to her husband Gunapala

by Niculas Appu.

[37] The 13th Defendant too has stated in evidence (p. 281) that Niculas

Appu first handed over the paddy land to him and thereafter, he handed

over the high land (Lot 2) for him in order to cultivate the paddy land:

wys jk f;la uu ta l=Uqfr w|f.dhd yehg jev l<d' ^281&

[38] At the trial, both the 12th and the 13th Defendants have thus, taken up

the position that initially, they entered upon the land in dispute under

Niculas Appu as his tenant cultivators (Vide pages 275 and 281) and after

25 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

the death of the said Niculas Appu, they cultivated the paddy lands in

question under Sirisena Sudusinghe who was the original 10th Defendant.

[39] If this position is correct, the 12th and the 13th Defendants should

have commenced their possession in a dependent or subordinate capacity

and thus, prescriptive possession is reckoned only from the point of time

at which a change in the character of possession, which satisfies the

requirement of adverse possession is capable of being proved. This

legal position was clearly recognized in the following passage in the

judgment of Bonser C.J. in Maduanwila v. Ekneligoda 3 NLR 213,215:

A person who is let into occupation of property as a tenant or as a licensee must be deemed to continue to occupy on the footing or as a licensee, must be deemed to continue to occupy on the footing on which he was admitted, until by some overt act he manifests his intention of occupying in another capacity. No secret act will avail to change the nature of his occupation.

[40] This approach of Bonser C.J. in Maduanwila v. Ekneligoda was

further confirmed by Howard C.J. in Navarathne v. Jayathunga 44 NLR

517 wherein, he stated that where a person enters into occupation of

property belonging to another with the latters permission, he cannot

acquire title to such property by prescription unless he gets rid of his

character of licensee by doing some overt act showing an intention to

possess adversely.

[41] In terms of the above-mentioned testimony of the 12th and the 13th

Defendants at the trial, they cannot acquire prescriptive title unless they

get rid of their character of tenancy or licensee by doing some overt act

showing an intention to possess adversely.

[42] The learned Counsel for the 13A Defendant has heavily relied on the

decision of the Court of Appeal in Meeruppe Sumanatissa Terunnanse v.

Warakapitiya Pangnananda Terunnanse 70 NLR 313 in support of his

26 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

contention that after the death of Niculas Appu, their license with Niculas

Appu was automatically terminated and hence, when the lisensees

continued to possess the highlands adversely to the heirs of Niculas Appu

for a period of over 10 years, they acquired prescriptive title to the same

(Vide- written submissions-page 5). In the aforesaid circumstances, he

invited us to apply the decision in Meeruppe Sumanatissa Terunnanse v.

Warakapitiya Pangnananda Terunnanse (supra) and hold that upon the

death of Niculas Appu in 1963, the licence came to an end and thereafter,

from 1963, up to the point of filing this action in 1983, the 13th Defendant

possessed the highland (Lot 2) adversely to all the others and acquired

prescriptive title to the same.

[43] In Meeruppe Sumanatissa Terunnanse v. Warakapitiya

Pangnananda Terunnanse (supra), the respondent, bhikku who was the

defendant in the original proceedings in the District Court was granted a

licence in 1942 by the appellant, who claimed to be the Viharadhipathi or

Chief Incumbent of the Temple, to live on a piece of land of about 18

acres in extent, as part of its property. After 1942, the respondent built on

this land an Avasa in which he lived with dayakas attached to him and

handed over in terms of the license to the Chief Incumbent, the paraveni

of the produce of the land. After 1953, he refused to do so. The appellant

filed action seeking to eject the respondent from the land. It was held that

license, which was granted to him in 1942 was clearly a revocable one

and a revocable license is automatically determined by the death of the

licensor or by the assignment, of the land over which the license is

exercised.

[44] In the case of Meeruppe Sumanatissa Terunnanse v. Warakapitiya

Pangnananda Terunnanse (supra), the fact that the respondent

(defendant) was granted a licence by the appellant (plaintiff) on the basis

27 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

of the mutually settled terms was not disputed at the trial. In the present

case, however, the Plaintiff challenged the position of the 12th and the 13th

Defendants that they entered upon the land in dispute on the basis of a

license granted by Niculas Appu or that they acted as tenant cultivators

of Niculas Appu until his death in 1963.

[45] The position of the 4th Defendant who represented the Plaintiff upon

his death was that (i) prior to Gunapala (husband of the 12th Defendant)

and the 13th Defendant occupied the houses on the land, one Charananda

and Mendis cultivated and occupied the land in dispute as tenant

cultivators of Niculas Appu; (ii) Charananda occupied the house in the

highland prior to Gunapala (p. 202) and Mendis occupied the house prior

to the 13th Defendant; (p. 182 & 192); (iii) after the death of Niculas

Appu in 1963, the 10th Defendant forcibly evicted Charananda and

Mendis and gave over the cultivation to Gunapala and Handi Singho (the

13th Defendant) who thereafter occupied the highlands and worked as the

tenant cultivators of the 10th Defendant only after the death of Niculas

Appu in 1963 (p. 182 & 193); (iv) the heirs of Niculas Appu who became

aware of a purported Deed of Gift No. 1232 (10V1) said to have been

given by Niculas Appu and his wife to the 10th Defendant during the

proceedings of the Testamentary Case, instituted action against the 10th

Defendant in 1971 for the cancellation of the said Deed; (v) the District

Court of Tangalle cancelled the said Deed in 1973 and the appeal filed

against the said judgment was dismissed in 1979.

[46] If there is proof, however, that a valid licence was granted by

Niculas Appu to Gunapala (husband of the 12th Defendant) and the 13th

Defendant, the general rule is that the licence will be terminated on the

death of the Niculas Appu as licensor and/or Gunapala and the 13th

Defendant as licensees or by the assignment of the land over which the

28 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

license is exercised. The question of the termination arises, however,

where there is evidence that there was a valid, binding agreement

between Niculas Appu as licensor and Gunapala and Handi Singho as

licensees, either explicitly or impliedly on the basis of the mutually

agreed terms.

[47] In the circumstances, the first question that arises is whether there is

satisfactory proof that Gunapala (the husband of the 12th Defendant) and

Handi Singho (13th Defendant) entered upon the land in question upon a

valid binding license granted by Niculas Appu prior to his death in 1963.

[48] It is not in dispute that Niculas Appu expired on 30.10.1963. It is to

be observed that only the 13th Defendant has pleaded in the statement of

claim that he entered upon the land in dispute under Niculas in 1955. The

12th Defendant has not pleaded at all in his statement of claim that he

entered upon the land under Niculas Appu.

[49] The learned Counsel for the 13A Defendant heavily relies on the

failure on the part of the 4th Defendant to answer the suggestion made by

the Counsel for the 13th Defendant at the trial that the 13th Defendant

possessed Lot 2 for a period of over 10 years on his own. He has

submitted that his silence amounts to an admission that the 13th

Defendant came into the possession of the land under Niculas but

continued to possess the same after his death and acquired prescriptive

title to the same by undisturbed and uninterrupted possession adversely to

all the others over a period of 10 years. The said suggestion at page 200

of the brief reads as follows:

29 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

[50] It is seen, however, that the 4th Defendant has categorically denied

in evidence the suggestion made on behalf of the 12th Defendant that the

12th Defendant entered upon the land under Niculas Appu and stated that

the 13th Defendant entered upon the land in dispute only after the death of

Niculas Appu in 1963 (pages 200-202):

[51] The 12th Defendant in her statement of claim has further stated that

she along with her husband Gunapala and her mother-in-law possessed

Lot 4 from 1938. She has, however, admitted under cross examination

that she first came to the land in 1964 after her marriage (page 275) but

changed her own version and stated that she came to the land after 1968

(page 277).

[52] Although the 12th and the 13th Defendants maintained their position

at the trial that they were the tenant cultivators of Niculas Appu before

his death, no credible evidence was presented by them to prove their

claim. On the other hand, the original 10th Defendant while claiming that

both Gunapala (husband of the 12th Defendant) and the 13th Defendant

were his tenant cultivators after 1962 has stated that Niculas Appu did not

use tenant cultivators and that he was the first person to appoint Gunapala

and Handi Singho as tenant cultivators (Page 228).

[53] The 10th Defendant did not, however, assert that the husband of the

12th Defendant or his own brother, the 13th Defendant entered upon the

land under Niculus Appu or that they built the cadjan houses in Lot 2 and

4 prior to the death of Niculas Appu in 1963. On the other hand, the

30 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

Paddy Lands Registers marked P14-P19 clearly indicate that the husband

of the 12th Defendant and the 13th Defendant had been the tenant

cultivators under the 10th Defendant for the years, 1966, 1968, 1970, 1971

and 1976 and therefore, there is no proof whatsoever, that the 12th and the

13th Defendants had been the tenant cultivators of Niculas Appu as

claimed by them.

[54] It is significant to note that the Surveyor has stated in his report

dated 20.05.1983 that there were 84 trees, 40-80 years old, such as

siyabala, kohomba, coconut and mango in Lot 2 which are all paraveni

trees and there were 31 trees, 10-20 years old, namely, 7 wood apple, 8

coconut and 16 arecanut trees. The 13th Defendant who was present at the

preliminary survey had only claimed the said 10-20 years old trees and

not the 40-80 years old paraveni trees.

[55] The Surveyor has further reported that there were 43 coconut trees,

40-50 years old in Lot 4, which are paraveni trees and 6 coconut saplings,

2-3 years old, 4 mango trees, 5-6 years old and 8 kohoba trees, 8 years

old. The 12th Defendant who was present at the preliminary survey had

not claimed the said paraveni trees, 40-50 years old, but claimed only 6

coconut saplings, 2-3 years old, 4 mango trees, 5-6 years old and 8

kohoba trees, 8 years old.

[56] The testimony of the 4th Defendant was that Gunapala and Handy

Singho entered upon the land in 1963 after the previous tenant cultivators

of Niculas Appu, namely, Mendis and Charananda were evicted by the

10th Defendant after the death of Niculas Appu in 1963. The Preliminary

Survey was done in 1983 and both the 12th and the 13th Defendants had

claimed the trees which are either only 15-20 years old. The fact that the

12th and the 13th Defendant had claimed trees which were only 15-20

years old in 1983 is consistent with the evidence of the 4th Defendant that

31 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

Gunapala and Handy Singho entered upon the land only in 1963 after the

death of Niculas Appu.

[57] The 13th Defendant has admitted under cross examination, that

Mendis, who worked in the paddy field for two seasons was evicted by

the Fiscal and thereafter, the heirs of Mendis instituted action against

him. He has further admitted that the possession of the paddy field in

which he cultivated was handed over to the heirs of Mendis in 1996 when

he lost the appeal. His evidence at pages 283-284 of the brief is as

follows:

[58] At the trial, it had been suggested to the 12th Defendant that

Charananda was evicted by the 10th Defendant and her husband Gunapala

was put into cultivation by the 10th Defendant in 1968. The 12th

Defendant has avoided answering the question by simply saying that she

32 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

was not aware of such incidents as she came to the land after 1968. Her

evidence at page 277 of the brief is as follows:

[59] The admission made by the 13th Defendant that Mendis also

cultivated the paddy field in dispute prior to him for 2 seasons and after

the eviction of Mendis, his heirs instituted action against him and the

possession was ultimately handed over to the heirs of Mendis is

consistent with the evidence of the 4th Defendant. This corroborates the

testimony of the 4th Defendant that Mendis and Charananda who worked

under Niculas were evicted by the 10th Defendant and thereafter, after the

death of Niculas in 1963, Gunapala and the 13th Defendant were put into

cultivation by the 10th Defendant.

[60] No credible documentary evidence such as Electoral Registrar or a

Grama Niladhari Certificate or such similar credible document or oral

evidence was presented by the 12th and the 13th Defendant to establish

that they entered upon Lots 2 and 4 respectively, and built the cadjan

houses standing thereon prior to the death of Niculas Appu in 1963 on the

basis of any permission granted by Niculas Appu. On the other hand, the

aforesaid attendant circumstances coupled with the admission of the 13th

Defendant under cross examination clearly indicate that Gunapala

(husband of the 12th Defendant) and Handi Singo (the 13th Defendant)

had only entered upon the land in question after the death of Niculas

Appu in 1963.

33 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

[61] For those reasons, there is no satisfactory and credible evidence that

has been presented by the 12th and the 13th Defendants that they entered

upon the land in question upon a license granted by Niculas Appu prior to

his death in 1963. For those reasons, I hold that the application of the

principle relied on by the learned Counsel for the 13A Defendant in

Meeruppe Sumanatissa Terunnanse v. Warakapitiya Pangnananda

Terunnanse (supra) will not apply to the present case.

The character of possession of Gunapala and Handi Singo

[62] Mr. Collure, the learned Counsel for the Substituted-Plaintiff has

submitted in his written submissions that while the learned Additional

District Judge correctly held that the 10th Defendant has failed to acquire

prescriptive title to the property in dispute, at best, the 12th and the 13th

Defendants could only be regarded as agents or licensees of the 10th

Defendant. His contention was that the 12th and the 13th Defendants being

the agents or licensees of the 10th Defendant could not claim prescriptive

title to Lots 2 and 4 when the 10th Defendant fails to prove prescriptive

title to the property in dispute.

[63] I find that the testimony of the 4th Defendant was that the original

10th Defendant came into possession of the property in 1963 after the

death of Niculas Appu and thereafter, he put Gunapala and Handi Singho

into occupation after 1963 by chasing away Mendis and Charananda who

worked under Niculas Appu until his death.

[64] The testimony of the 10th Defendant was that the land was originally

owned by Niculas Appu and after he became the owner of the land by

virtue of a Deed of Gift bearing No. 1232, he entered into the possession

of the entire land in 1962. His evidence was that his brother Handi Singho

(13th Defendant) and Gunapala worked as his tenant cultivators (page

228). He has specifically stated in evidence that he possessed the entire

34 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

land, including the two highlands (Lots 2 and 4) and Gunapala and Handi

Singo cultivated and occupied the two highlands under him paying rent to

him in respect of the paddy field. (page 223 & 224).

[65] The testimony of the 10th Defendant was very clear that Gunapala

and Handi Singho were his tenant cultivators who worked under him

paying the rent to him and thus, the husband of the 12th Defendant,

Gunapala and his brother, the 13th Defendant, were tenant cultivators who

occupied the highlands in their capacity as his tenant cultivators while he

(the 10th Defendant) possessed both the paddy lands and highlands.

[66] A perusal of the record reveals that the 12th and the 13th Defendants

did not challenge the evidence of the 10th Defendant who stated that the

husband of the 12th Defendant and the 13th Defendants worked under him

and paid rent to him while he possessed the entire land including the two

highlands (Lots 2 and 4). It is significant to note that the 12th Defendant

almost admitted the testimony of the 10th Defendant when she stated that

the paddy land and the highland (Lots 1, 3 and 4) were given to her by the

10th Defendant who possessed the entirety of the land through her and she

only paid the rent to the 10th Defendant. Her evidence at page 272, 276

and 277 of the brief is as follows:

[67] It is also significant to note that the 13th Defendant who asserted that

he possessed the plantation in Lot 2, however, did not challenge the

testimony of his brother, the 10th Defendant when the 10th Defendant

testified to the effect that he (the 10th Defendant) took the harvest of the

highlands including coconuts in the 2 highlands and the 13th Defendant,

his brother worked under him (page 224). The character of the 12th and

the 13th Defendants as the cultivators of the 10th Defendants in the paddy

lands is further confirmed by the documents marked P14-P19 which

describe that Gunapala and Handi Singho had acted as tenant cultivators

of the 10th Defendant from 1966.

[68] In the circumstances, it is crystal clear that after the death of Niculas

Appu in 1963, the 12th and the 13th Defendants had entered upon the

paddy land in dispute as cultivators and occupied the two highlands (Lots

2 and 4) for the purpose of cultivation under the 10th Defendant. As

noted, the 12th and the 13th Defendants have failed to present satisfactory

evidence and prove that they entered upon Lots 2 and 4, built new houses

and occupied the said two Lots prior to 1963.

Requirement of uninterrupted possession of the original 10th

Defendant

[69] The learned Additional District Judge has held that although the 10th

Defendant possessed the land in question from 1963, the heirs of Niculas

36 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

Appu who became the co-owners of the property in question instituted an

action against the 10th Defendant and the widow of Niculas Appu in the

District Court on 19.04.1971 (P8) and the judgment delivered by the

District Court on 27.02.1973 (P12) against the said Defendants was

affirmed by the Court of Appeal on 13.12.1979 (P12). Therefore, the

possession of the 10th Defendant was interrupted before the expiration of

the period of 10 years when the action was instituted against the 10th

Defendant in 1971.

[70] The learned Additional District Judge has correctly held that as the

present action was filed on 05.01.1982 after the dismissal of the appeal in

1979, the 10th Defendant could not have lawfully acquired prescriptive

title to the land in dispute for a period of over 10 years in terms of section

3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

Prescriptive claims of the 12th and the 13th Defendants to Lots 2 and 4

[71] It was the submission of Mr. Collure that the learned Additional

District Judge having found that the 10th Defendant had failed to acquire

prescriptive title to the subject-matter in terms of section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance could not have decided that the 12th and the 13th

Defendants, being his mere agents or licensees acquired prescriptive title

to Lots 2 and 4 depicted in Plan No. 154. His submission was that the 12th

and the 13th Defendants could not have claimed a title adverse to or

independent of that of the lawful heirs of Niculas Appu when it was

demonstrated that they were mere agents or licensees of the 10th

Defendants and accordingly, the exclusion of Lots 2 and 4 from the

corpus of the action is erroneous in law.

[72] Mr. Collure has further submitted that the high land portions,

namely, Lots 2 and 4 depicted in Plan No. 154 are the two threshing

floors (Kamathas) of the paddy field called Thunmulla and that these

37 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

two highland portions which were not separated from the paddy lands

were used by the two cultivators who resided there for the sole purpose of

cultivating paddy. He has submitted that accordingly, the highland

portions are part and parcel of the entire land called Thunmulla. The

learned Counsel for the 13A Defendant has, however, disputed this

position and submitted that the Plaintiff himself has pleaded in his Plaint

that the land to be partitioned consists of the highlands, namely, Lot 2 and

4 and the paddy lands, namely, Lot 3 and 5 and therefore, the Plaintiff is

estopped from denying that the two highland portions are separate from

the paddy lands depicted in Plan No. 154.

[73] The submission of the learned Counsel for the 13A Defendant was

that the prescriptive title of the 13A Defendant should be limited to the

area of possession, namely, Lot 2 depicted in Plan No. 154 and thus, the

consideration of the paddy areas are irrelevant. He invites us to consider

the evidence of the 13th Defendant and the findings of the learned

Additional District Judge that the 13th Defendants had occupied the house

in Lot 2, planted trees and possessed the said Lot for a period of over 10

years against all the others and acquired prescriptive title to the same.

[74] In view of these submissions, the question that arises for

consideration is whether the 12th and the 13th Defendant can claim an

independent prescriptive title in respect of Lots 2 and 4 if these two areas

form part of the paddy field and the cultivators occupied them for the sole

purpose of cultivating the paddy on behalf of the person who put them

into occupation.

[75] Now the question is whether in deciding the prescriptive possession

of the 12th and 13th Defendants in respect of the actual area of possession,

due regard should also to be given to the nature and use of the property of

which it is susceptible including any payment or services rendered by the

38 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

12th and the 13th Defendants in respect of the property. In Raki v. Lebbe

16 NLR 138, the issue arose whether the title acquired by prescription

must be limited to the actual area of possession which was held by the

party claiming prescriptive title. Wood Renton J. referred to the words

any other person in the explanation in section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance and held at page 140 that it does not mean that a prescriptive

title should be proved against the whole world:

I dont think that the wordsanother person in that explanation (in section 3 of Ordinance No. 22 of 1871) would justify us in holding that a declaration of title on the ground of prescriptive possession could never be successfully claimed unless the claimant was in a position to show a title adverse to the whole world. It would, perhaps, not be right to limit the scope of the words with another personto the particular person against whom prescriptive title was set up.

[76] Lascelles C.J. while observing that it is possible for a party to an

action to establish title by prescription without proving that his possession

was adverse to the whole world, but that question, must be answered with

due regard to the manner of occupancy, the nature of the property and to

the use and cultivation of which it is susceptible. Lascelles C.J. at page

143 stated:

The other ground of appeal relates to the extent of land to which the plaintiffs have established title . It is said that title acquired by prescription must be limited to the actual area of which possession is had, and authorities were cited for that proposition. This, as a general proposition, is good law, but it must be applied with due regard to the nature of the property and to the use and cultivation of which it is susceptible.

[77] It is, thus, important to examine whether there is any closeness or

relationship between the highland and the paddy lands in terms of nature,

use, occupation and cultivation of which it is susceptible as the

39 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

submission of Mr. Collure was that both highland portions are the

threshing floors (Kamatha) of the paddy field and hence, are used for the

cultivation and connected purposes.

[78] A perusal of the testimony of the 4th Defendant reveals that there are

two threshing floors (Lots 2 and 4) on the paddy field (Lots 1 and 3) and

the two cultivators are residing on the two highland portions and the trees

planted on the said high land portions belong to the paddy field. His

testimony was that it is in these highland portions where paddy was

stored, threshed, the crop was stacked and other connected activities in

the paddy field occur (page 193). In fact, the 12th Defendant has admitted

in evidence that the highland in extent of acre was used as the

threshing floor of the paddy field (pages 278-279).

[79] The 13th Defendant has also admitted in evidence that he used the

high land (Lot 2) as the threshing floor, including for storing, sorting and

stacking of paddy until he lost his tenancy rights:

jYfhka md lf<a w|f.dNdjh wfydais jk f;la (page 282).

[80] It is crystal clear that the two high lands (Lots 2 and 4) were used by

the 12th and the 13th Defendants as threshing floors, namely for

cultivation purposes such as storage, separating, drying and stacking of

paddy and other connected activities by the cultivators with no defined

40 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

boundaries. In the circumstances, the two highland portions (threshing

floors) forming part of the two paddy fields were used by the cultivators

who worked under the 10th Defendant and resided in the two houses

standing thereon for cultivating purpose from 1963 as correctly submitted

by Mr. Collure in his written submissions.

[81] The 12th Defendant has clearly admitted the evidence of the 10th

Defendant and stated that Lot 4 was handed over to her by the 10th

Defendant who possessed the entire land (Lots 1-5) through her ^isrsfiak

iqoqisxy imQK bvu nqla;s |skafk uu ud.fhka)-page 272 and that

she only paid the rent to the 10th Defendant. The 13th Defendant did not

challenge the evidence of his brother, the 10th Defendant who stated that

he possessed the entire land, including the coconut trees on the high land

portions and the 13th Defendant only worked under him (p. 224).

[82] The question that arises for decision in this case is whether the 12th

and the 13th Defendant who claimed to be tenant cultivators under the 10th

Defendant and demonstrably occupied the highlands under him for the

cultivation purpose could acquire the prescriptive title to the high land

portions when the 10th Defendant himself has failed to prove his

prescriptive title to the whole land.

[83] The 10th Defendant is not the lawful owner of the paddy field and

thus, he cannot lawfully appoint the 12th and the 13th Defendants as his

lawful tenant cultivators as correctly held by the learned Additional

District Judge in his judgment. Although any arrangement between the

10th Defendant and the 12th and the 13th Defendants may be binding on

the parties to such arrangement, it is not binding on the lawful owners of

the paddy field as the 10th Defendant cannot create tenancy rights against

the rightful owners without their authority or consent or subsequent

ratification.

41 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

[84] Although the 10th Defendant claimed prescriptive title against the

lawful co-owners of Niculas Appu and put the 12th and the 13th

Defendants into occupation on the basis of an invalid Deed of Gift and

possessed the land for some time through the 12th and the 13th Defendant,

the co-owners disputed his title and accordingly, the said Deed of Gift

was cancelled by the District Court.

[85] It is not in dispute that the cadjan houses, cadjan kitchens and the

temporary lavatories in Lot 2 and 4 were claimed only by the 12th

Defendant and the 13th Defendants who reside there. No evidence was,

however, presented by them that those buildings were made with the

intention of holding Lot 2 and 4 adverse to the true owners other than

occupying them for cultivating the paddy field. In this regard, it is to be

noted that when the 12th Defendant was questioned as to who made the

buildings on Lot 4, her answer was that she repaired the buildings that

existed there before and that they were made by those who previously

claimed their rights. m%( f bvfu ;udg mosx bkak f.hla ;sfhkjo@

[86] The words a possession unaccompanied by payment of rent or

produce, or performance of service or duty, or by any other act by the

possessor, from which an acknowledgement of a right existing in another

person would be fairly and naturally be inferred in section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance are significant in considering the question

42 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

whether the 12th and the 13th Defendants could claim any prescriptive

possession as against the co-owners of Niculas Appu.

[87] In Kiri Hamy Muhandiram v. Dingiri Appu 6 NLR 197, Moncrieff J.

stated that in order that a person may avail himself of section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance No. 22 of 1871, the possession must be shown

from which a right in another person cannot be fairly or naturally

inferred. In Jain Carrim v. Rahim Dholl (1892) 2 C.L.R. 118, Burnside

C.J. stated that such a possession, if not accompanied by payment of rent

or performance of service or some act from which an acknowledgment of

title in another may be inferred, and if it so continues for the prescriptive

period, gives a good title by prescription. Burnside C.J. Further

observed, however, that mere occupation, such as that of a servant or

agent or guest of another would not amount to possession under this

Ordinance.

[88] it is well settled that the possession of the agent is the possession of

the principal and in view of the relationship between the agent and

principal, the agent could not be permitted to claim his own possession as

long as he was in the position of the agent (David Lee v. John Lawson

Kennedy [1889] XIV H.L. (E) 437 and Chandrakantaben v. Vadilal

Bapalal, AIR 1989 SC 1269).

[89] In the present case, the 10th Defendant who claimed to have acquired

prescriptive title to the entire land has failed to establish prescriptive title

against the lawful co-owners of Niculas Appu. Once the 10th Defendant

fails to establish his title by prescription against the lawful owners, the

12th and the 13th Defendants who worked under him either as his

cultivators or agents or licensees are also estopped from acquiring

prescriptive title against the lawful owners unless they are able to

43 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

establish an independent possession adversely to the lawful owners by a

manifestation of an intention of holding Lot 2 and 4 as owners.

[90] In the case of Maduwanwala v. Ekneligoda 3 NLR 213, Bonser C.J

held that a person who is let into occupation of the property as a tenant,

or as a licensee, must be deemed to continue to occupy on the footing on

which he was admitted, until by some overt act he manifests his intention

of occupying in any other capacity. No secret act will avail to change the

nature of his occupation. Bonser C.J further held that possession, as I

understand it, is occupation either in person or by agent, with the

intention of holding the land as the owner.

[91] In Siyaneris v. Jayasinghe De Silva 52 N.L.R. 289, the Privy Council

decided that if a person goes into possession of a land as an agent for

another, prescription does not begin to run until he has made it manifest

that he is holding adversely to his principal. Mere general statements of

witnesses that a claimant possessed the land or planted trees and mere

occupation under some other person or persons for a number of years are

not evidence of adverse possession necessary to support a title by

prescription under section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. It is necessary

that the witnesses should speak to specific facts and the question of

possession has to be decided thereupon by Courts (Sirajudeen v. Abbas

(supra).

[92] In the present case, the 12th and the 13th Defendants who worked

under the 10th Defendant should be fully aware that Niculas Appu was the

original owner and that the 10th Defendants Deed of Gift was cancelled

and thus, the heirs of Niculas Appu became the co-owners upon his death

in 1963. As possession of the 12th and the 13th Defendants was not

originally adverse but only in a representative capacity and thus, when

they claim that it has become adverse, as against the lawful owners and

44 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

the 10th Defendant, they must prove an intention on their part to possess

Lot 2 and 4 adversely. How do they prove this intention? They must

prove a manifestation of that intention to the lawful owners, the heirs of

Niculas Appu, against whom they set up their adverse possession.

Adverse possession

[93] Undoubtedly, the element of adverse possession is a hostile or

possession against the title of the lawful owner and it includes exclusive

possession, for example, by a defendant to the action in practical

contravention of the plaintiffs right with the intention to hold the

property in the possessors own right and against the right of the lawful

owner (Sona Devi v. Nagina Singh, AIR 1997 part 67). Adverse

possession in this sense implies that it commenced in wrong and is

maintained against right (Achal Reddy v. Ramakrishna Reddiar, AIR

1990 SC 553 at 555).

[94] It is to be noted that where a person who claims title to a property by

adverse possession, must plead and prove:

1. on what date he came into possession;

2. when and how the adverse possession commenced (starting point);

3. what was the nature of his adverse possession;

4. whether the factum of adverse possession was known to the lawful

owner;

5. how long his possession has continued; and

6. his possession was open and undisturnbed and uninterrupted.

[95] The mere long possession of a property of a person in any

representative capacity under another person without any interference

from the lawful owners, by itself is not enough to acquire prescription by

adverse possession, as long possession is not necessarily adverse

possession. Thus, mere long possession, it is trite, for a period of more

45 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

than 10 years without anything more does not ripen into an adverse

possession under section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

[96] Unless a clear intention is manifested by the possessor by clear and

unequivocal evidence that his possession was adverse to the lawful

owners, there would be no reason to hold, by the mere fact of long

possession or that the lawful owners had not prevented such possessor

from doing some acts, that the possessor held the property by adverse

possession against the lawful owners.

[97] The 12th Defendant has admitted that the 10th Defendant possessed

the entire land through her and the 13th Defendant did not challenge the

evidence of the 10th Defendant who claimed that the 12th and the 13th

Defendants worked under him. The attendant circumstances and the

admissions made by the 12th and the 13th Defendants, however,

demonstrate that the 12th and the 13th Defendants who entered upon the

paddy land under the 10th Defendant, paid the rent to the 10th Defendant

and occupied Lots 4 and 2 respectively under him for cultivation

activities.

[98] They being agents or cultivators or licensees of the 10th Defendant,

more or less acknowledge the possession of the 10th Defendant and thus,

they could not claim prescriptive title by adverse possession against the

lawful owners by a mere long possession or mere occupation in Lots 2

and 4 in the eye of the law unless they have made it manifest that they are

holding Lots 2 and 4 adversely to the rightful owners of the land.

[99] The well settled rule of law is that a possession of a licensee or of an

agent or a permissive possession to become adverse, must be established

by cogent and convincing evidence to show hostile possession adverse to

the knowledge of the lawful owners and thus, mere possession for

howsoever length of time, does not result in converting such possession

46 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

into adverse possession (Thakur Kishan Singh v. Arvind Kumar, AIR

1995 SC 73 at 74).

[100] In my view, that mere possession or mere occupation in Lots 2 and

4 or rebuilding cadjan houses or planting trees or taking produce by the

12th and the 13th Defendants for a period of over 10 years in

representative capacity as agents of the 10th Defendant are insufficient to

to treat the land as their own and adverse to the rightful owners. I desire

to point out that the 12th and the 13th Defendants acts and conduct are

quite consistent with the position of agents under the 10th Defendants and

they continued to occupy the property in that capacity until they can

establish a starting point for their acquisition of prescriptive rights by

proving a manifestation of an intention to the rightful owners against

whom they set up their adverse possession.

[101] In the instant case, there was no evidence of open assertion of

hostile title against the lawful owners by a clear manifestation of

intention of holding the property as to when possession had become

adverse and hostile. When it has been demonstrated that the 12th and the

13th Defendants went into possession of Lots 2 and 4 under the 10th

Defendant as his agents, the time does not run until, they have made it

manifest by cogent and convincing evidence, an intention of holding Lots

2 and 4 adversely to the lawful owners.

[102] In short, the possession to become adverse, must be nec vi, nec

clam, nec precario, that is to say, the possession required must be

adequate in continuity, in publicity and in extent to show that

possssession is adverse to the competitor (Secretary of State for India v.

Debendra Lal Khan (28) AIR 1934 PC 23). It is sufficient that

possession be overt and without any attempt at concealment so that the

person against whom time is running out, if he exercises due vigilance, to

47 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

be aware of what is happening (V. Muthiah Pillai v. Vadambal, AIR 1986

Mad 106). In the present case, the lawful owners of the property, who

became aware of the purported Deed of Gift No. 1232, exercised due

diligence and instituted action against the 10th Defendant who put the 12th

and the 13th Defendants into possession as his agents and the said case

was decided in their favour.

[103] They have failed to show that their position changed by a

manifestation of an intention of holding Lots 2 and 4 as owners, i.e., by

some overt act to possession against the rightful owners of the property.

i.e., a holding with the intention of keeping Lots 4 and 2 to himself as

owners.

[104] Accordingly, the 12th and the 13th defendants have not established

the requirements of adverse possession for a period of 10 years previous

to the filing of the action, which are explicitly adverted to in Section 3 of

the Prescription Ordinance. It is quite apparent that the 12th and the 13th

Defendants as mere agents of the 10th Defendant have failed to establish

their prescriptive title by a manifestation of an intention of holding Lots 2

and 4 to the lawful owners. In the result, the findings of the learned

Additional District judge that the 12th and the 13th Defendants have

established prescriptive title to Lots 4 and 2 respectively, depicted in Plan

No. 154 are set aside.

[105] The 12th and the 13th Defendants would, in my view, be only

entitled to compensation for improvements made to the cadjan houses,

cadjan kitchens and temporary lavatories and the plantations claimed in

Lot 2 and 4 depicted in the Preliminary Plan No. 154 as per the Report of

the Commissioner dated 20.05.1983.

[106] On a consideration of the totality of the evidence and the

circumstances of this case, I hold that the learned Additional District

48 C.A No. DCF- 524A/99 D.C. Hambantota P/280

Judge wrongly excluded Lots 2 and 4 from the corpus of the action on the

basis of prescriptive title of the 12th and the 13th Defendants.

Share allocation of the parties

[107] As noted, the 9th Defendant was entitled to undivided share on

Deed No. 1627 dated 23.06.1981 (9V1) and thus, the 1st Defendant could

not have claimed undivided rights on Deed No. 707 dated 12.03.1980

(1V1). Accordingly, the learned Additional District Judge has correctly

decided that the Plaintiff could not have claimed undivided 1/6 share

from the 1st Defendant on Deed No. 708 dated 12.03.1980 (P3) (Vide-

page 30 of the judgment). In the result, the Plaintiff is only entitled to

undivided 1/24 + 1/40 shares of the corpus of the action.

[108] A perusl of the judgment however, reveals that the learned

Additional District Judge has allotted undivided 20/120 shares to the

Plaintiff when the Plaintiff is only entitled to undivided 1/24 + 1/40

shares (8/120 share) and thus, the said share allocation ought to be

corrected in accordance with this judgment.

[109] In the circumstances, the parties would be entitled to undivided

rights in the following manner:

The 9th Defendant 1/2 - undivided 60/120

The Plaintiff 1/24 + 1/40 - undivided 8/120

The 2nd Defendant 3/24 + 1/8 - undivided 30/120

The 3rd Defendant 1/40 - undivided 3/120

The 4th Defendant 1/40 - undivided 3/120

The 5th Defendant 1/40 - undivided 3/120

The 6th Defendant 1/40 - undivided 3/120

The 7th Defendant 1/24 - undivided 5/120

The 8th Defendant 1/24 - undivided 5/120

Conclusion

[110] For those reasons, the decision of the learned Additional District

Judge of Hambantota to exclude Lots 2 and 4 depicted in Plan No. 154 is

set aside and those two Lots are directed to be included in the corpus of

the action.

[111] In view of the foregoing, I hold that the 9th Defendant is entitled to

undivided share of the subject-matter of the action (undivided 60/120)

as correctly decided by the learned Additional District Judge.

Accordingly, it is hereby declared that the following parties are entitled to

undivided rights of the corpus of the action in the following manner:

The Plaintiff - undivided 8/120

The 2nd Defendant - undivided 30/120

The 3rd Defendant - undivided 3/120

The 4th Defendant - undivided 3/120

The 5th Defendant - undivided 3/120

The 6th Defendant - undivided 3/120

The 7th Defendant - undivided 5/120

The 8th Defendant - undivided 5/120

The 9th Defendant - undivided 60/120

[112] The 12th and the 13th Defendants are entitled to compensation for

the improvements made to cadjan houses, cadjan kitchens and the

temporary lavatories in Lots 4 and 2 respectively, depicted in the

Preliminary Plan as described in the Report marked X1 (without any

soil rights). The 12th and the 13th Defendants are also entitled to

compensation in respect of the plantations claimed by them before the

Commissioner as referred to in the Report of the Commissioner marked

X1. Other plantations shall be allotted as per the Report of the

Commissioner marked X1.

from the southern-eastern side of Plan bearing No. 154 as directed by the

learned Additional District Judge in his judgment. The pro rata costs shall

be borne by the parties in proportion of their respective rights to the land.

[114] The learned District Judge of Hambantota is directed to enter

judgment and interlocutory decree in accordance with the directions

enumerated in this judgment and proceed to partition accordingly.

[115] The judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of

varied. Subject to the said variation, the Appeal of the Substituted-

Plaintiff is allowed. No costs.
