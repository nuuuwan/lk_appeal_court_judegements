MENAKAWIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to set aside the order dated 28th

February 2020 of the learned High Court Judge of Panadura.

The suspect petitioner had been taken in to custody on 24.6.2018 by the Moratuwa

police for being in possession of 40 grams of gross quantity of heroin.

It is well settled law that when a party files a revision application that the petitioner

must satisfy this court that under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code

(hereinafter referred to as the CPC) act No 15 of 1979 that there is an ,

1) illegality in the impugned order,

2) impropriority of any sentence or order,

3) irregularity in the proceedings.

The above provision has been discussed in Attorney General vs. Ranasinghe and others

1993 (2) Sri L.R 81.

In the instant application the suspect petitioner has been produced under the provision

of the Poisons Opium Drugs Act no 13 of 1984, and according to the said act a suspect

can be enlarged on bail under section 83(1) of the act and under which a suspect has to

show that there are exceptional circumstances to enlarge the suspect on bail. The

exceptional circumstances have been discussed in

LabynidarageNishanthi V. Attorney General [CA (PHC) APN 48/2014], It was held that,

it is trite law that any accused or suspect having being charged under the above act will

be admitted to bail only in terms of section 83 (1) of the said Act and it is only on

exceptional circumstances. Nevertheless it is intensely relevant to note, the tern

exceptional circumstances has not been explained or defined in any of the Statutes.

Judges are given a wide discretion in deciding in what creates a circumstance which is

exceptional in nature.

There are plethora of cases in the legal parlor which had identified what creates an

exceptional circumstances in relation to granting bail

In the instant application the exceptional grounds pleaded by the petitioner is that the

discrepancies in the place of arrest of the petitioner along with the telephone tower

details of the investigative officers, and the suspect petitioner being in remand upon

receipt of the Government Analyst report because indictment was not filed, creates an

exceptional situation where the suspect petitioner should be enlarged on bail.

But the position of the respondents, is that the facts of the case should not be gone in to

at the time of considering the bail application, which this court observes has been

discussed in CA Revision Application CA (PHC) APN 147/17 by her ladyship

WickramasingheJ.The respondents further says that the petitioner had filed a further

bail application before the same High Court, before the same judge on 15.2.2021 and

the same has been rejected and that particular order should be canvassed in revision

and not this order made on 28.2 2020.

Anyhow having considered the submissions of both parties this court is of the view that

in the instant application indictment has already been filed and although the petitioner

canvases some irregularities in the investigations this court is of the view that those

matters, as set out in previously decided orders of this court, are matters to be

considered at trial stage, hence there are no exceptional grounds set out by the

petitioner to enlarge the suspect on bail as per the provisions of the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Act and there is no irregularity or an impropriety in the order of the

learned High Court Judge.

Hence the instant application is hereby dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
