MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for bail has been filed to set aside the order dated

But as the application proceeded the counsel appearing for the petitioner

submitted to Court that if the bail conditions of the petitioner are varied

he is satisfied. Hence this Court directed the Counsel appearing for the

Attorney General to file in writing whether they have any objection to

the said application.

Hence according to the document filed by the Counsel for the Attorney

General they have no objection to the said application.

Hence upon consideration of the above submissions this court while

affirming the order of the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw the bail

conditions set out in the said order from roman numbers 1 to 8 are

hereby set aside and the following conditions are imposed,

1) A cash bail of Rs 500000/, 2) Two sureties to the value of Rs 1000000/each
