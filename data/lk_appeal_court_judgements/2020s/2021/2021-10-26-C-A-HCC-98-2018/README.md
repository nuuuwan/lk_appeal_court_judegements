Counsel : Nayantha Wijesundara for the Accused- Appellant Janaka Bandara, SSC for the State Written Submissions On : 05.02.2019 (by the Accused-Appellant) 10.05.2019 (by the Respondent) Argued On : 27.07.2021 Decided On : 26.10.2021 ******************** Devika Abeyratne,J

The accused appellant was indicted and after a non jury trial was convicted

for the murder of Kosmulgodage Lional alias Podi Malli and sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence the appellant has preferred

this appeal to this Court.

The accused appellant was connected via zoom platform and it was

informed that the he has given consent and instructed his Counsel to argue the

matter in his absence due to the Covid Pandemic.

The main ground of appeal on behalf of the Appellant is that the

circumstantial evidence adduced by the prosecution does not prove the guilt of

the accused appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

3

There were no eye witnesses to the incident and the case rested mainly on

circumstantial evidence.

The deceased was employed as a watcher in a Saw Mill that belonged to

PW 1. The accused appellant is the machine operator of that Saw Mill who was

occupying a room upstairs in the partially built two storied building that was in

the premises of the Saw Mill. The watcher, (the deceased) according to PW 1 is

on duty from around 5.00 pm until 8.00 am the following morning. He is stationed

on the ground floor where his dead body was discovered on 12th September 2010.

The wife of the deceased PW 2 Nandani Silva had been informed of her

husbands death on the morning of the 12th of September by a telephone message.

She has testified that on the previous afternoon when the deceased left for work

around 4.00 pm, he has stated that the dispute with the Baas had to be sorted out.

The reason for the dispute has not been divulged. In pages 35 and 36 of the brief

it is set out in the following manner.

It is apparent from the above that no name or specific identification was

given of the person the deceased had a dispute with. It is clear that PW 2 did not

personally know the baas referred to by her husband or the reason for the dispute.

PW 1 the owner of the Saw Mill had seen the watcher at work when he

left at 8.00 pm, the night before the body was discovered. The accused appellant

according to PW 1 had gone out to buy liquor, which apparently is his habit every

night. The following morning around 6.30 and 7, one of the nephews of PW 1 has

informed that the watcher was not talking and after seeing him fallen on the

ground at the Saw Mill PW 1 had lodged a complaint with the Police and found

out that the watcher was dead. PW 1 has testified about an issue between the

deceased and the appellant over ten rupees that had not been returned by the

appellant, but has not elaborated on it. Neither has the Prosecution attempted to

discover more information of that alleged dispute. No other evidence has

transpired regarding any other existing animosity between the accused appellant

and the deceased.

The only contradiction V1 has been marked in page 56 of the brief that

PW 1 in his police statement has stated that the watcher was on duty from 6 pm

to 6 am, whereas in evidence has stated that the duty is from 5 pm to 8 am. This

is not a material contradiction that goes to the root of the case and the credibility

of the witness is not affected in any manner by that contradiction.

5

In the Dock Statement of the accused appellant he has stated that around

6.30 am on the 12th when he was descending from the upper floor, a person named

Thushara had informed that the watcher was dead. Appellant has denied any

involvement in the incident. The police after inquiring who was in the premises

has arrested and assaulted him and produced him as an accused for the offence of

murder.

From the evidence of PW 1 and the Dock Statement of the appellant it

appears that the person who discovered the body and informed both PW 1 and

the accused of the death of the watcher was a person called Thushara who is not

a witness in this case.

The Prosecutions failure to call Thushara as a witness is surprising as his

presence at the scene of the incident should have been explained. There is no

material before Court to consider whether the investigators ruled out the

possibility whether he was a person of interest as there are no eye witnesses to

the incident.

According to PW 7 the Medical Officer, the cause of death is due to

complications of blunt force trauma to the head and neck. Twenty one injuries

of lacerations and abrasions have been described. There had been a delay of

pronouncing the cause of death which has been done after some blood samples

were examined. The time of death is given as within a day when the post mortum

was performed which was at 12 noon on the 13th of September. (page 67 of the

brief).

When this evidence and the fact that the deceased was found to be dead at

6.30 in the morning of the 12th is considered, it reiterates the importance of the

6

evidence of the presence of Thushara . The failure to call Thushara as a witness

by the prosecution has to be considered in favour of the appellant.

The prosecution has relied on a Section 27 recovery where an Athakoluwa

was discovered.

It was submitted by the Counsel for the Appellant that at a Saw Mill any

amount of pieces of wood resembling an Athakoluwa could be found.

PW 7 who was shown the Athakoluwa marked as P 4 has stated that the

injuries could have been caused by such an object. However, there is no forensic

report regarding P4. Therefore, it had not been established beyond reasonable

grounds that P4 was used to cause injury to the deceased.

In such circumstances it is not established that it was in fact the object used

to kill the deceased. If at all the recovery of P4 only proves that the appellant had

knowledge of P4 being in that place. (Etin Singho and another vs Queen 69 NLR

353)

The investigating officer PW 5 has testified that on the direction of the

appellant P4 was found among some stacked timber at the Saw Mill. As stated

above it being found in a Saw Mill where any amount of Athakoluwas can be

found is a relevant fact to be considered in favour of the accused.

It was contended on behalf of the appellant, that the Prosecution has failed

to prove the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt relying on

circumstantial evidence and that the learned High Court Judge has misinterpreted

the evidentiary value of the purported items of circumstantial evidence and

thereby the conviction is erroneous.

7

It is well settled law that when the conviction is solely based on

circumstantial evidence prosecution must prove that no one else but the Accused-

Appellant committed the crime. The following authorities set out the position

very succinctly.

Rex v Blom, cited in Queen v Kularatne (71 NLR 529 at 534) states two

cardinal rules of logic governing circumstantial evidence cases.

i. The inference sought to be drawn must be consistent with all the proved

facts. If it does not, then the inference cannot be drawn. ii. The proved fact s should be such that they exclude every reasonable

inference from them, save the one to be drawn. If they had not excluded

the other reasonable inferences, then there must be a doubt whether the

inference sought to be drawn is correct.

In Don Sunny vs Attorney General [1998] 2 Sri. L R 1 it was held where

a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the proved items of

circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point towards the

only inference that the accused committed the offence. On a consideration of all

the evidence the only inference that can be arrived at should be consistent with

the guilt of the accused onlyif upon a consideration of the proved items of

circumstantial evidence if the only inference that can be drawn is that the accused

committed the offence then they can be found guilty

Kusumadasa Vs. State 2011(1) SLR 240 Sisira de Abrew J held that;

The prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused had

the opportunity of committing the offence. The accused can be found guilty only

8

and only if the proved items of circumstantial evidence is consistent with their

guilt and inconsistent with their innocence.

In Sarath Fernando Vs. Attorney General 2014(1) SLR 16 it was held

that;

In order to justify the inference of guilt from purely circumstantial

evidence the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the

accused and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than

that of his guilt.

In Samantha Vs. Republic of Sri Lanka 2010 (2) SLR 236 the court stated

that; In a case of circumstantial Evidence, if an inference of guilt is to be draw

against the accused such inference must be the one and only irresistible and

inescapable inference that the accused committed the crime.

On a perusal of the judgment in the instant case, it appears that one of the

positions the learned trial judge has considered is the last seen theory. It is

important to consider that the usual place of abode for the appellant and the

deceased at night is the Saw Mill. Therefore it is not unusual if they were at the

Saw Mill that night. When PW 1 left at 8 pm that night only the watcher had been

there and PW 1 had assumed that the appellant had gone out to buy liquor. Thus,

there is no cogent evidence that the deceased was last seen in the company of the

appellant. Therefore, the trial judge s conclusion that PW 1 has seen the

deceased together with the appellant is contradictory to the evidence led at the

trial.

If the prosecution is relying on the last seen theory, it is incumbent that the

exact time of death of the deceased to be established. But in the instant case, the

9

exact time of death has not been established beyond reasonable doubt. It is also

to be considered that the Saw Mill is an open place accessible to any outsider.

The learned judge has failed to appreciate all these important facts in his analysis

and evaluation.

It appears that the learned trial Judge has considered PW1stating that the

deceased and the appellant had a dispute over Rs 10, together with the evidence

of PW 2 stating that the deceased informed her of a dispute with a baas the

previous day. Who this bass is not established. It has also not been established

whether there was a dispute over ten rupees. However, the learned trial judge has

considered these facts as the proved circumstantial evidence against the appellant,

to come to a conclusion that it was the motive for the killing.

In the case of AG Vs. Potta Naufer & others 2007(2) SLR 144

Thilakawardena J held;

When relying on circumstantial evidence to establish the charge of

conspiracy to commit murder and the charge of murder, the proved items of

circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point towards the

only inference that the accused committed the offence.

It is settled law that if upon a consideration of the proved items of

circumstantial evidence if the only inference that can be drawn is that the accused

committed the offence he can be found guilty. However, it is incumbent on the

prosecution to prove that no one else other than the accused had the opportunity

of committing the offence. The accused can be found guilty only if the proved

items of circumstantial evidence is consistent with his guilt and inconsistent with

his innocence.

Emperor v Browning in 1917 18 Criminal Law Journal 482, Court held

The Jury must decide whether the facts proved exclude the possibility that the

act was done by some other person and if they have doubts, prisoner must have

the benefit of those doubts.

Karunaratne V AG 2005 2 SLR 233 (Balapatabendi J)

(At Page 237) There is no uniform rule for the purposes of determining

the probative value of circumstantial evidence. This depends on the facts of each

case. In State UP v Dr. Ravindra Prakash Mittal (1992 2 SCJ 549) it was held

that the essential ingredients to prove guilt of an accused person by

circumstantial evidence are,

1. The circumstances from which the conclusion was drawn should be

fully proved

2. The circumstances should be conclusive in nature;

3. All the facts so established should be consistent with the hypothesis of

guilt and inconsistent with innocence.

4. The circumstance should; to a moral certainty, exclude the possibility

of guilt of any person other than the accused.

Therefore, it was incumbent on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable

doubt that it was only the accused appellant who had the opportunity to commit

the murder.

In the instant case as stated above the body of the deceased was found in

an open area where anyone could have entered without any obstruction. There is

also a doubt as to whether it was only the appellant and the deceased who were

in the premises as the presence of Thushara is unexplained. As such, it appears

that the evidence that was considered as proved evidence by the learned trial

11

judge is not sufficient to come to a conclusion that no one else other than the

accused appellant had the opportunity of committing the offence.

After considering the evidence elicited it is apparent that the evidence is

insufficient to base a conviction that on the proven facts a justifiable inference

can be drawn about the guilt of the accused appellant.

On consideration of the above. this court is of the view that the case against

the appellant was not proved with certainty in order to justify a verdict of guilt.

Accordingly, we set aside the judgement dated 07.08.2018 of the learned

High Court Judge of Colombo and allow the appeal. The appellant is acquitted of

the charge.
