Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

The 1st and 2nd Petitioners are the President and Secretary of the School

Development Society of the Mummana Muslim Vidyalaya, a rural school situated in

Dambadeniya with a student population of over 200 students and offering classes

from Grade 1 to the Ordinary level examination. While the 3rd and 4th Petitioners are

old boys of the said school, the children of the 5th and 6th Petitioners are currently

studying in the said school.

The Petitioners state that at its inception in 1962, the school was situated on a land

in extent of 3R 39P. That extent has since been reduced to an extent of 80P,

apparently as a result of the School allocating land once occupied by the school for

the construction of a building for commercial use. The Petitioners state that the

school was in need of a playground for its students, and that in 1977, a local

businessman named L.M.P. Navaratne had agreed to make available to the school, a

land in extent of 1A 7.2P owned by his mother, which was situated opposite the

school, for the above purpose. The Petitioners state further that the acquisition

procedure laid down in the Land Acquisition Act commenced in September 1976 with

the issuance of the Section 2 notice followed by the notice under Section 4 in

September 1978. It is admitted that even though the notice under Section 7 had

been published, the acquisition process had come to a standstill in 1980.

The Petitioners claim that the owner had agreed to make available the land for the

exclusive use of the school and that the above acquisition was for the said purpose.

The Petitioners state further that the land was used by the school as its playground

as well as for all school functions. In 2002, the School Development Society had taken

steps to fence the said land with the approval of the 4th Respondent, the Divisional

Secretary, Pannala. The Petitioners claim that the playground was maintained at all

times by the school and that all expenses in that regard were borne by the school.

The Petitioners admit that the said playground had been used over the years by

several societies and groups belonging to other communities for their functions and

events. Whenever the playground was required for such use, the practice had been

for the party requiring the land to make a request to the 9th Respondent, the

5

Principal of the School who then sought the approval of the 1st Respondent, the

Zonal Director of Education.

In April 2016, a group by the name of Samagi Kreeda Samajaya had sought the

approval of the 9th Respondent to use the playground for a New Year event followed

by a musical show. The Petitioners state that although the 9th Respondent had

sought approval for both events, the 1st Respondent had only granted approval to

use the playground from 6am-6pm for the events associated with the New Year. As a

result, the event had not been held.

The Petitioners state that this incident led to the creation of tension between the

communities living in that area and that normalcy was initially restored with the

assistance of the law enforcement agencies. However, as the events escalated, the

Police had reported facts to the Magistrate who had issued an order to maintain law

and order in the area.

The above issue has prompted the 4th Respondent, the Divisional Secretary, Pannala

to seek permission of the Secretary, Ministry of Education to abandon the acquisition

process and thereafter hand over the land to the Pradeshiya Sabha, Pannala, for the

use of the school and those living in the said area vide letter dated 24th August

2016 marked P2.

The Petitioners state that the 2nd Respondent had thereafter directed the 9th

Respondent not to use the said land for any activities of the school. This position has

been conveyed to the Secretary of the School Development Society by the 9th

Respondent vide letter dated 29th September 2016 marked P27.

This issue had also been discussed at the meeting of the Pannala Pradeshiya

Development Committee held on 10th October 2016, as borne out by the minutes of

the said meeting marked P29, where it had been decided that the land be acquired

by the Pradeshiya Sabha and for the playground to be made available for the use of

the school during school hours and for the residents of the area thereafter.

The Petitioners claim that they had a legitimate expectation that the land will be

acquired for the exclusive use of the school and that the above decisions violate that

6

expectation. Aggrieved by the decisions in P2, P27 and P29 that the playground

be shared with the people of the area, the Petitioners filed this application in April

2017. By an amended petition filed on 3rd October 2019, the Petitioners have sought

the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decisions in P2, P27 and P29;

b) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 4th, 7th and 8th Respondents to complete the

acquisition process and vest the land in the said School;

c) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the 4th Respondent from handing over the land

to the Pradeshiya Sabha.

I shall first consider whether the Petitioners are entitled to a Writ of Mandamus. The

conditions that must be satisfied for a Writ of Mandamus to issue have been clearly

set out by the Supreme Court in Ratnayake and Others vs C.D.Perera and Others1 as

follows:

The general rule of Mandamus is that its function is to compel a public

authority to do its duty. The essence of Mandamus is that it is a command

issued by the superior Court for the performance of public legal duty. Where

officials have a public duty to perform and have refused to perform, Mandamus

will lie to secure the performance of the public duty, in the performance of

which the applicant has sufficient legal interest. It is only granted to compel the

performance of duties of a public nature, and not merely of private character

that is to say for the enforcement of a mere private right, stemming from a

contract of the parties.

In Rajeswari Nadaraja v. M. Najeeb Abdul Majeed, Minister of Industries and

Commerce and Others2 Aluwihare, J held that:

In an application for a writ of mandamus, the first matter to be settled is

whether or not the officer or authority in question has in law and in fact the

1 (1982) 2 Sri LR 451. 2 SC Appeal No. 177/15; SC Minutes of 31st August 2018.

power which he or she refused to exercise. As a question of law, it is one of

interpreting the empowering statutory provisions. As a question of fact, it must

be shown that the factual situation envisaged by the empowering statute in

reality exists.

I have examined the letter marked P2 and observe that the children of the owner of

the land had informed the 4th Respondent in 2016 that the land was allocated for the

use of both Sinhala and Muslim children and the residents of the area. This position

is reflected in the letter dated 16th June 2016 sent by L.H.P. Navaratne marked

14R6. Thus, the argument of the Petitioners that the land was intended for the

exclusive use of the school does not appear to be correct. In any event, the

Petitioners too concede that the land was used by both the school and the people in

the area. In his written submissions, the learned Counsel for the Petitioners has

admitted that the land has been used by several societies and community groups for

their private functions. The learned Counsel for the 14th and 15th Respondents too

has admitted that both groups have used the said land for their community activities.

Thus, the Petitioners cannot have a legal right to have the land acquired for the

exclusive use of the school nor does the 4th Respondent owe the Petitioners a legal

duty to do so. I am therefore not inclined to direct the 4th Respondent to complete

the acquisition process forty years after it was stalled.

This brings me to the legality of the decisions in P2, P27 and P29. The Petitioners

themselves have traced the events that arose as a result of trying to restrict the use

of the said land to the school. The school does not have the exclusive use of the said

land and the decisions that are reflected in P2 and P29 must be viewed in the light

of the circumstances that had arisen in the said area. The learned Counsel for the

Petitioners have submitted that, the Petitioners are agreeable to use this as school

playground which could be acquired for the Ministry of Education in the Province and

to conduct different activities by the communities and sports clubs when it is not

needed for the school.3 This is the same decision that is reflected in P2 and P29.

P27 has been sent to reflect the decision in P29. In these circumstances, I do not

see any illegality in the said decisions.

3 Vide paragraph 28 of the written submissions of the Petitioners.

The learned Senior State Counsel has quite correctly submitted that the dismissal of

this application will not resolve the underlying issue that gave rise to this application.

The owners of the said land have indicated by 14R6 that the land must be used for a

playground for all communities living in the area. I direct the 4th Respondent to

ensure that the said land:

(a) is made available for the use of the school during week days from 6am 4pm

and for the use of the general public from 4.30pm to 8pm;

(b) is made available for the use of the general public on public holidays and every

weekend except the last weekend of every month which shall be allocated for

the use of the school,

provided the factual position in 14R6 has not changed.

This judgment shall not prevent the (a) 4th Respondent from seeking the assistance of

the Pradeshiya Sabha of Pannala and the Ministry of Education of the North Western

Province with regard to the maintenance of the land; (b) 4th Respondent from taking

steps to hand over the land to the Pradeshiya Sabha, Pannala subject to the above

directions with regard to the use of the land, as may be amended in such a manner

that ensures the use of the land by the school and all communities; (c) the

Pradeshiya Sabha, Pannala taking steps to have the said land acquired in terms of

Section 128 of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No. 15 of 1987, as amended for the use of

the school and the community.

Subject to the above, this application is dismissed, without costs.
