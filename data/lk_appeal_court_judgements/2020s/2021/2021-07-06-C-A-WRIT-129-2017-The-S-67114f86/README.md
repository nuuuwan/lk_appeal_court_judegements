Before: Arjuna Obeyesekere, J / President of the Court of Appeal Counsel: M.A. Sumanthiran, P.C., with Viran Corea and Niran Anketel for the Petitioner

Manohara Jayasinghe, Senior State Counsel for the Respondents Argued on: 31st August 2020 Written Tendered on behalf of the Petitioner on 10th June 2019 and 5th October Submissions: 2020 Tendered on behalf of the Respondents on 10th June 2019 Decided on: 11th June 2021 Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

The Petitioner is the Superior Regular of the Society of Jesus in the Diocese of

Trincomalee and has been incorporated by an Order made under Section 114 of the

Trusts Ordinance, published in Gazette No. 12,077 dated 11th March 1960, marked P1.

The Petitioner states that by virtue of Deed No. 1788 dated 1st September 1962, marked

P2a, and Deed No. 2423/621 dated 24th July 1969 and 23rd July 1970, marked P2b, the

Petitioner acquired ownership of a land called Thalaiaddikadu situated at

Neeroddumunai Tamblegam Pattu in the Trincomalee District. The Petitioner has

produced Plan No. 366 dated 16th May 1994 marked P3, which gives the extent of the

said land as 22A 3R and 29P. P3 is a re-survey of Preliminary Plan No. 4196/294.

The Petitioner states that since about 2011, the Sri Lanka Air Force (the SLAF) has been

in possession of the said land and using the land to operate a tourist hotel. Aggrieved by

the use of the land by the SLAF, and the denial of access to the Petitioner to the said

land by the SLAF, the Petitioner filed Fundamental Rights Application No. 404/2013 in

the Supreme Court on 26th November 2013, against the 3rd Respondent, the

Commander of the SLAF and others complaining that its fundamental rights guaranteed

under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(h) of the Constitution have been violated as a result of

3

the alleged unlawful occupation of the said land by the SLAF and the denial of access to

the said land. The petition in the said fundamental rights application marked P5(a) was

amended in 2014 vide P5(b). The said application was later withdrawn on 11th

September 2017 vide R2 as the Petitioner had filed this application.

The Petitioner states that during the course of the proceedings before the Supreme

Court, the 2nd Respondent, the Divisional Secretary, Trincomalee had filed an affidavit

marked P5(c), in which he stated that the land has been acquired by the State under

the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act (the Act). The 2nd Respondent had also stated

that the material pertaining to the acquisition which were in the custody of the District

Secretary, Trincomalee had been destroyed during the conflict, but that the material

obtained from National Archives have revealed the following matters:

a) A notice had been issued under Section 2(1) of the Tourist Development Act No. 14

of 1968 approving the acquisition of the said land, as well as several other lands in

the area, for a Tourism Development Project. The said notice has been published in

Gazette No. 152 dated 21st February 1975 - vide P6;

b) Pursuant to a requisition for a survey made by the Tourist Board, an Advanced

Tracing depicting the said land as Lot B had been prepared by the Surveyor

General in December 1975;1

c) Final Village Plan No. 26 (Supplement No.3) dated 30th November 1977 has been

prepared by the Surveyor General, in which the said land has been depicted as Lot

No. 287 containing in extent 22A 2R 37P;2

d) The Supplementary Tenement List pertaining to the above Final Village Plan has

specified the Petitioner as being the claimant to the said land;

e) A notice issued under Section 7 of the Act had been published in respect of the

said land in Gazette No. 318 dated 19th May 1978 vide P10b;

1Vide document marked C and annexed to the affidavit of the 2nd Respondent. 2Vide document marked D and annexed to the affidavit of the 2nd Respondent.

4

f) An Order under proviso (a) to Section 38 of the Act had been published in respect

of the said land in Gazette No. 330 dated 11th August 1978 vide P7.

It must be noted that the Petitioner has not named the Ceylon Tourist Board as a

respondent to this application.

The 2nd Respondent had also stated that the Section 7 notice marked P10b had been

found only during a further search at the National Archives and that by then, steps had

already been taken to publish (a) a notice under Section 5 of the Act in Gazette No.

1924/40 dated 23rd July 2015, marked P8, and (b) a notice under Section 7 of the Act in

Gazette No. 1968/12 dated 25th May 2016, marked P9.

The Petitioner states that it was not aware of the fact that the said land had been

acquired and that they came to know of the said acquisition for the first time by way of

P5(c). The Petitioner instituted this action in 2017, seeking inter alia the following relief

from this Court:

(a) A Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent, the Minister of Lands to issue

an Order in terms of Section 39 of the Act revoking P7;

(b) A Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent to issue a divesting order in

terms of Section 39A of the Act;

(c) Writs of Certiorari to quash P6, P7, P8, P9 and P10b.

The Petitioner states that the Respondents have failed to produce the Section 2 or

Section 4 notices in respect of the said acquisition referred to in P7, and that the only

inference that could be drawn by the failure to produce such notices is the absence of

such notices. The Petitioners first complaint therefore is that P7 is ultra vires the

provisions of the Act, in that the mandatory provisions of the Act leading up to a vesting

order under proviso (a) to Section 38 have not been complied with. The Respondents,

while disputing the claim of the Petitioner that the relevant Section 2 and Section 4

notices were not published, has submitted that the documents have been destroyed.

5

Section 38 of the Act sets out that at any time after an award for compensation is made

under Section 17, the State can take possession of the land to which the said award

relates to. In terms of the proviso (a) to Section 38, under which P7 has been issued:

.... the Minister may make an Order under the preceding provisions of this section-

(a) where it becomes necessary to take immediate possession of any land on the

ground of any urgency, at any time after a notice under section 2 is exhibited

for the first time in the area in which that land is situated or at any time after

a notice under section 4 is exhibited for the first time on or near that land;

In terms of Section 40(a) of the Act:

When an Order of the Minister under section 38 is published in the Gazette, then

where that Order is in regard to the taking possession of a particular land, that

land shall, by virtue of that Order, vest absolutely in the State free from all

encumbrances with effect from the date on which that Order is so published, and

any officer who is authorized to do so by that Order may, on or after that date, take

possession of that land for and on behalf of the State;

Therefore, in terms of proviso (a) to Section 38, possession of the land that is sought to

be acquired can be taken any time after a Section 2 notice or Section 4 notice is

exhibited in respect of the said land. Section 41 of the Act provides that if the provisions

of Section 4 have not been complied with, it is not necessary to comply with those

provisions, and that if a declaration in terms of Section 5 has not been made, such

declaration can be published notwithstanding that Section 4 has not been complied

with. Be that as it may, with the publication of P7, the said land has vested absolutely

in the State.

As noted earlier, the 2nd Respondent has submitted that the notices published prior to

the Section 7 notice P10b under and in terms of Sections 2, 4 and 5 of the Act have

been destroyed and therefore are not available. It is clear from the above sequence of

6

events that the notice under proviso (a) to Section 38 has been published only after the

Section 7 notice had been published, thereby demonstrating that the order to take over

possession has been made only after claims for compensation have been called. In these

circumstances, I am satisfied that a Section 7 notice would not have been published

unless the notices under Sections 2, 4 and 5 had been published.

The learned Senior State Counsel for the Respondents submitted that in any event, in

terms of P7, the said land has been vested with the State since 11th August 1978 and

that there has been inordinate delay on the part of the Petitioner in invoking the

jurisdiction of this Court challenging the said order. He therefore submitted that this

application is liable to be dismissed on that ground alone.

The Superior Courts of this country have consistently held that a petitioner seeking a

discretionary remedy such as a Writ of Certiorari must do so without delay, and where a

petitioner is guilty of delay, such delay must be explained to the satisfaction of Court. In

other words, unexplained delay acts as a bar in obtaining relief in discretionary

remedies, such as Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus.

In Biso Menika v. Cyril de Alwis3 Sharvananda, J (as he then was) set out the rationale

for the above proposition, in the following manner:

A Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court. It cannot be held to be

a Writ of right or one issued as a matter of course. But exercise of this discretion by

Court is governed by certain well accepted principles. The Court is bound to issue a

Writ at the instance of a party aggrieved by the order of an inferior tribunal except

in cases where he has disentitled himself to the discretionary relief by reason of his

own conduct, like submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay or waiver...... The

proposition that the application for Writ must be sought as soon as injury is caused

is merely an application of the equitable doctrine that delay defeats equity and the

longer the injured person sleeps over his rights without any reasonable excuse the

chances of his success in a Writ application dwindle and the Court may reject a Writ

3[1982] 1 Sri LR 368; at pages 377 to 379. This case has been followed by the Supreme Court in Ceylon Petroleum Corporation v. Kaluarachchi and others [SC Appeal No. 43/2013; SC Minutes of 19th June 2019].

7

application on the ground of unexplained delay...... An application for a Writ of

Certiorari should be filed within a reasonable time from the date of the Order which

the applicant seeks to have quashed.

In Seneviratne v. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and another,4 the Supreme Court, adverting

to the question of long delay, held as follows:

If a person were negligent for a long and unreasonable time, the law refused

afterwards to lend him any assistance to enforce his rights; the law both to punish

his neglect, nam leges vigilantibus, non dormientibus subveniunt,5 and for other

reasons refuses to assist those who sleep over their rights and are not vigilant.

The explanation offered by the Petitioner for the delay is that it was not aware of any of

the steps that were taken with regard to acquisition from 1975 and that it came to know

of that position only through the aforementioned affidavit filed by the 2nd Respondent

in the Fundamental Rights application. However, it appears from the aforementioned

Advanced Tracing that the surveyor has visited the land in November 1975 and that the

boundaries of the said land have been shown by the Grama Sevaka of the Vellaimanal

Division No. 229. The same position applies with regard to the Final Village Plan

prepared in November 1977. Furthermore, the name of the Petitioner and in particular

the name of the Superior Regular of the Petitioner is given as the claimant to the said

land. With all of the above activity going on, the Petitioner could not have been

unaware of the above steps taken to acquire the said land. Thus, I am unable to accept

the explanation offered by the Petitioner for the delay. I agree with the submission of

the learned Senior State Counsel that the Petitioner is guilty of laches and that the

Petitioner is not entitled to challenge P7 at this point of time.

The next complaint of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner was that the

Section 5 notice published in 2018 P8 - is not preceded by a Section 2 notice and is

therefore illegal. It appears from the explanation offered by the 2nd Respondent that the

State resorted to a fresh Section 5 notice prior to locating the Section 7 notice (P10b)

4 [1999] 2 Sri LR 341 at 351. 5 For the law assists the watchful, (but) not the slothful.

8

issued in 1978. In any event, P8 is superfluous in view of the conclusion that I have

already arrived at that there has been a valid vesting of the land in terms of P7.

The Petitioner has also sought a Writ of Mandamus directing that an Order be made

under Section 39 of the Act, or in the alternative under Section 39A of the Act.

Section 39 reads as follows:

Notwithstanding that by virtue of an Order under Section 38 (hereinafter in this

section referred to as a vesting order) any land has vested absolutely in the State,

the Minister may, if possession of the land has not actually been taken for and on

behalf of the State in pursuance of that Order, by subsequent Order published in

the Gazette revoke the vesting order.

A precondition to an order under Section 39 of the Act is that possession of the land has

not actually been taken for and on behalf of the State. The argument of the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner is that even if P7 was issued after following due

procedure set out in the Act, the State did not take possession of the land in 1978 or

thereafter until the Air Force took over the land in 2011. As submitted by the learned

Senior State Counsel, this land is situated in close proximity to the SLAF base at China

Bay and had been used by terrorists to launch attacks on SLAF aircrafts, which

demonstrates that even though the State may have taken possession of the land in

1978, the State may not have been in possession of the land at the height of the conflict.

I must note that the Petitioner has not produced any material to demonstrate that it

was in possession of the said property or that it visited the said property, paid rates,

cultivated any crops etc, or that it was in possession when the said land was taken over

by the SLAF. The Petitioner has produced marked P12 a letter written in January 1995

by a person who had visited the said land at the request of the Petitioner. P12 shows

that the Petitioner was not in possession of the land and that the land was occupied by

squatters. While the writer of P12 has shown an interest in purchasing the land or

taking it on a long lease, the Petitioner has not apprised this Court as to what its

response was. Be that as it may, the fact remains that the State is now in possession of

the land.

9

It is admitted that the land was acquired in terms of P7 for a Tourism Development

Project, as stated in P6. However, the 2nd Respondent has stated in the affidavit

tendered in the Fundamental Rights application that from or about 2001, the Armed

Forces have been in possession of the said State land which is of strategic importance

for the national security of Sri Lanka. The 2nd Respondent has stated further that the

Cabinet of Ministers by a decision dated 28th November 2012 had decided to allocate an

extent of approximately 600 acres including the said land to the Sri Lanka Air Force in

order to protect the China Bay Air Force Camp and for development activities connected

therewith, including the runway and related facilities at China Bay as an alternative to

the Katunayake Air Force Camp. The Cabinet Memorandum and Cabinet Decision have

been marked as J and I to P5(c). There is now a new public purpose for which the

land is required.

The issue to be considered here is whether once an acquisition is carried out, and the

land is vested in the State, whether the State can thereafter take possession of the land

and/or use it for a public purpose other than the public purpose for which it was initially

intended.

This issue was considered in the case of Kingsley Fernando v. Dayaratne and Others,6

where Sarath N. Silva, J (as he then was) held as follows:

In any event the fact that land was acquired for a particular public purpose does

not prevent the land being used for another public purpose. The following

observations made by Alles J. in the case of Gunawardena vs. D.R.O. Weligama

Korale7 are relevant:

Even assuming that after the order made under section 38 the Crown had

decided to utilise the land for some other public purpose, I do not think that it

is open to a person whose land has been acquired and the title to which has

been vested in the Crown to maintain that the acquisition proceedings are

6 [1991] 2 Sri LR 129. 7 73 NLR 333.

10

bad.....I can however see no objection to the Crown utilising the land for a

different public purpose than that for which it was originally intended to be

acquired. Circumstances may arise when it may become necessary for the

Government to abandon the original public purpose contemplated and utilise

the land for another public purpose.

A similar view that a change in public purpose was permissible was taken by Mark

Fernando, J in the case of De Silva v. Atukorale, Minister of Lands, Irrigation and

Mahaweli Development and Another8 where it was held as follows:

If compensation has been paid or improvements have been made, then despite

the inadequacy of justification, divesting is not permitted. The purpose and the

policy of the amendment is to enable the justification for the original acquisition,

as well as for the continued retention of acquired lands, to be reviewed; if the four

conditions are satisfied, the Minister is empowered to divest. Of course, even in

such a case it would be legitimate for the Minister to decline to divest if there is

some good reason - for instance, that there is now a new public purpose for

which the land is required. In such a case it would be unreasonable to divest the

land, and then to proceed to acquire it again for such new supervening public

purpose. Such a public purpose must be a real and present purpose, not a

fancied purpose or one which may become a reality only in the distant future.

I am satisfied with the explanation offered by the Respondents that there is a new

requirement of the land, which is buttressed by the relevant Cabinet Memorandum and

Decision. Therefore, I am of the view that possession of the said land has been taken

over on behalf of the State for a public purpose, and that the Petitioner is not entitled to

the revocation of P7.

As an alternative, the Petitioner has sought a divesting Order under Section 39A of the

Act if this Court is of the view that the occupation of the Sri Lanka Air Force amounts to

possession of the land.

8 [1993] 1 Sri LR 283.

11

The following conditions must be satisfied for a divesting Order to be made under

Section 39A(2):

(a) No compensation should have been paid under the Act to any person or persons

interested in the land in relation to which the said divesting Order is to be made;

(b) The land has not been used for a public purpose after possession of such land has

been taken by the State under the provisions of paragraph (a) of section 40 ;

(c) No improvements have been effected to the said land after the Order for

possession under paragraph (a) of section 40 had been made; and

(d) The person or persons interested in the said land have consented in writing to take

possession of such land immediately after the divesting Order is published in the

Gazette.

On the basis of the material that is before this Court, I have already held that the State

has taken over possession of the land and that the land is now being used by the SLAF

for purposes of the China Bay Air Force Camp, and for national security. As the land is

being used for a public purpose, the conditions that need to be satisfied for a divesting

order to be made under Section 39 has not been met.

This brings me to the final issue raised by the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner that the Petitioner has not been paid any compensation. Acquisition

proceedings having taken place and title to the said land having vested with the State,

the Acquiring Officer has called for claims for compensation in 1978, but no further

steps have been taken in that regard thereafter. The 1st and 2nd Respondents are hereby

directed to:

a) Call for claims for compensation in pursuance of the notice under Section 7

published in 1978, with notice to the Petitioner;

b) Determine entitlement to compensation; and

12

c) Thereafter take steps in terms of the Act to pay compensation, within six months

of today.

Subject to the above, this application is dismissed, without costs.
