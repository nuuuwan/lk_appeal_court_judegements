Their Lordships, therefore reading the word including broadly have reached the same conclusion as Blagden J. at first instance, following the decision of Gilchrist J. in an earlier case of an appeal in Trinidad by one Joseph Galvan Kelshall (No. 443 of 1939). This construction as Gilchrist J. pointed out is supported by the fact that in sub-paragraph (f) there are no limiting words referring specifically to the acquiring of income, such as appear in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of the same section. Further, this construction is not inconsistent with section 12 which read together with section 10, is of limited application and does not take away that which has been expressly provided by section 10(1)(f) .",
