In terms of the Clause 9.2.6 of the Circular P1, it is the duty of the parents/legal guardians of the children to produce all necessary documents to the Interview Board. In terms of the Clause 11.8 of the Circular P1 the documents which are placed before the Interview Board at the time of the interview are the only ones that should be reinvestigated/reviewed by the Appeal and/or Objection Investigation Board. Hence, I am of the view that the Appeal and/or Objection Investigation Board is not empowered by law to consider any such new documents. Therefore, I see no force in the Petitioners argument that he has not been afforded a fair hearing before arriving at a final decision by the Respondents.",

Therefore, the Petitioner claims that subsequent refusal amount to a breach of his legitimate expectation. It seems that the decision taken at the interview to award 95 marks was due to an oversight of the interview board having failed to consider the proper eligibility criteria. However, it appears that the Interview Board has taken proper steps to remedy its oversight which led to an erroneous decision. Such erroneous decision remedied shall not amount to a failure to follow the due process and such erroneous decision does not give rise to a Legitimate Expectation.",
