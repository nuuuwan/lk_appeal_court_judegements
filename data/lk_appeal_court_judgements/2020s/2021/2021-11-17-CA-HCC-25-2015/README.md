R. Gurusinghe, J.

The appellant was convicted for having murdered one Sunil Perera on the 10th of

December 2004 at a place called Mahawelawatte in the Gampaha District.

There were no eyewitnesses to the incident in which the deceased was murdered.

The prosecution had called PW1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14. The appellant

made a dock statement.

From the evidence of PW3, Wimaladasa, it transpired that the deceased and the

appellant came to the boutique of PW3 in the evening of the fateful day, and both

of them had bought illicit liquor. The deceased, the appellant, and another

person called Ratne had consumed liquor and smoked, while chatting near the

boutique. After that, the three of them, namely the deceased, the appellant, and

Ratne, left the place at about 5.30 p.m. They walked down the lane towards a

rubber estate. On the same evening, around 7.00 p.m., a person known as Sena

Aiya came in a Jeep and told Wimaladasa, that "Aiya was stabbed," and

proceeded.

PW2, Lionel Perera, testified that he and his brother, the deceased, went to a

paddy field to apply fertilizer. On their way back home, his brother went to

3

Wimaladasa's boutique around 5.00 or 5.15 p.m., and he (PW2) came home

alone. While he was at home, he received information from Sugath that a person

like his brother was lying fallen in the rubber estate. Immediately he went with

his sister-in-law, Nandaseeli, and many others, to the rubber estate and found

his brother lying fallen on the ground with around three stab injuries and six

injuries on his chest. After that, his brother was taken to the Dompe hospital,

where they learned that his brother was dead.

PW6, Simon Perera, testified that the villages said that Sunil Perera had been

murdered. When he met the appellant on the following day, he asked the

appellant if the police came in search of him. The appellant said, "it is said that

Sunil was murdered by me", and went away. However, Simon Perera has not

made a statement to the police regarding this until after four months of the

incident.

Police witnesses gave evidence with regard to the investigation, the rest of the

appellants, and the recovery of the knife, in terms of Section 27 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

PW7, Ranjith, had made a statement to the police about four months after the

murder. He testified that the appellant said to him,"I stabbed Jogi Sunil. Sunil

attempted to attack me, so I stabbed".

The doctor had also testified regarding the injuries of the deceased in the post

mortem report and has marked the same in evidence.

The appellant made the dock statement. He said that he had been serving as a

laborer at Nelumdeniya Estate. While he was working, an unknown gang had

come and assaulted him and taken him to a coconut estate, where he was again

beaten severely. Then he was taken to the Dompe police station. After that, he

was taken to his home at Mahawelawatte where he was again beaten

4

severely and introduced a knife, and forced him to admit it as his. Thereafter, he

was again taken to the Dompe police station, and PW7 Ranjith, was also taken

to the police station.

The appellant was convicted and sentenced to death. The main point alleged

against the appellant was that he confessed to PW7, Ranjith, that "I stabbed Jogi

Sunil. Sunil attempted to attack me, so I stabbed". The other points are that the

deceased was last seen alive with the appellant. The appellant had been

absconding from the police for about four months. The appellant said to PW6

that "it is said that I murdered Sunil", and the police recovered a knife from the

appellant's house, on the statement made by the appellant to the police.

The grounds of appeal are as follows:

1) The Learned Trial Judge has failed to address her mind to the legal

principles governing a case that solely rests on circumstantial evidence

and seriously misdirected herself in coming to the conclusion that the

prosecution had established a strong prima facie case against the

appellant.

2) The Learned Trial Judge has failed to express her mind to the legal

principles governing the discovery of a fact, consequential to a statement

of an accused, under Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance.

3) The Learned Trial Judge has failed to appreciate that PW7 Ranjith is not

a reliable witness as there are many infirmities in his testimony.

5

4) The Learned Trial Judge has seriously misdirected herself with regard to

the consequent conduct of the appellant and coming to the conclusion that

the appellant was absconding after the incident.

5) The Learned Trial Judge has seriously misdirected herself and erred in law

by treating the dock statement made by the appellant as inferior evidence

and finding fault with the accused for not giving evidence from the witness

box and failed to apply principles governing the evaluation of a dock

statement.

6) The Learned Trial Judge has failed to evaluate and analyse the evidence

properly and to consider the burden of proof cast upon the prosecution

and the standard of proof in a criminal case.

PW7 was accused in a murder case where the appellant was also a co-accused,

and the case was still pending at the time of the incident in this case. The alleged

offence in this case was committed on 10th December 2004. The appellant was

arrested on 23rd March 2005. PW7 had given a statement to the police on 27th

April 2005. By this time, the appellant was in custody.

PW7 gave a statement to the police more than four months after the incident. In

Sumanasena vs. Attorney General 1999 3SriLR137, Jayasooriya J stated,"If the

reason for the delay is plausible and justifiable, the court could act on the

evidence of the belated witness." However, here PW7 did not give a reasonable

explanation.

The position regarding his delay in giving a statement is as follows:

At page 171 of the brief

6

"m%: F ;a;slre tf,I lsjdg miqj thd ;uhs fmd,SiShg f.dia tAhd .ek oekq oSulaj;a

lf,a ke;af;'

W: uu tAl ftpr .kka .;af; kE' .uq okakjdfk' wlrK m%Yakh: .uq lshkafk lo@ W: .f l;djla .shd f wms .syska wekakd lshd

In the cross-examination, he has stated;

m%: tfyuk wehs ;ud tu ldrKh lshkak fmd,SiShgs .sfha ke;af;a@ W: uu tAl lshkak .sfha keye'

Nothing has been stated about the delay in the judgment. The delay has not been

considered at all. There was no decision by the Trial Judge as to whether the

reason for the delay was plausible.

A confession is required to be proved like any other fact in a criminal trial. An

extra-judicial confession is generally considered to be a weak form of evidence.

However, in Gopi vs. a State of Kerala (criminal appeal No. 129 of 1987) dated

10/4/1990, Pathmanabam J. said this in paragraph 6 of the judgment.

"Extra judicial confession is said to be a weak form of evidence. But we do not

feel any type of evidence could be said to be weak by categorization alone. It is

the worth of evidence that counts. When extra-judicial confession spoken to by

an impartial and trustworthy witness is found unblemished and acceptable,

nothing prevents its acceptance as a basis for conviction. Only thing is that the

7

court must be cautious in accessing and accepting the evidence because wrong

statements being put in. Evidence regarding extra-judicial confession is just like

any item of evidence. When such evidence gets corroboration and support from

other acceptable sources, the position is still better".

It has been the rule before a confession can be accepted, the exact words used

by the accused must be established by cogent evidence. In this case, no

questions were put to PW7 to ascertain the exact words used by the accused.

Proof of extra-judicial confession should be very convincing. In this case, PW7

cannot be considered as an impartial and trustworthy witness. Witness PW7

himself was accused in a murder case along with the appellant. PW7 was no

stranger to courts. He was familiar with the procedure and questioning of

witnesses in court. He had delayed giving a statement to the police for more than

four months. When considering the evidence of PW7 with the infirmities stated

above, it is not safe to act upon that evidence.

Now we consider whether there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction

after excluding the evidence of PW7.

One of the items of evidence against the accused was the testimony of PW6.

PW 6 stated as follows:

ux weyejd uyskaof.ka Bfha fmd,Sisfhk afydhkak wdjd wdrxhS' Fudllao nx weyef@ t;fldg thd lsjd iqks,a uerejd lshkafk uufk lsh,d lshdf.k .shd'

8

This statement is not a confession or admission. Therefore, this piece of evidence

is clearly hearsay evidence and should not have been admitted and could not

have been considered against the appellant. Similar to PW7, PW6 also made a

statement to the police after four months of the incident. There was no

explanation for the delay at all.

Another point relied on by the prosecution was that the appellant was

absconding from the village. However, PW8 Upasena, the watcher of the estate,

where the appellant was working at the time of his arrest, testified in court that

the appellant had been working in that estate for about one year. The appellant

was arrested after four months after the incident. The appellant had been

working in the same estate even after the alleged incident. Furthermore, PW3

made statements in his evidence regarding the behavior of the appellant.

At page 60 of the brief;

f.or ysfhd;a msg whf.a jevlghq;= j,g ksr; fjkj" .sfhd;a .shme;af;a wjqre .dKla

bkak mqoa.,fhla'"

Therefore, his absence from the village has no significance.

Other item of evidence against the appellant is that the recovery of a knife on the

statement of the appellant. In his dock statement, the appellant said that the

police severely assaulted him till he urinated in his sarong and introduced a

knife. A police witness stated that the appellant urinated in his sarong when he

was arrested. This shows that there is some truth in the appellant's dock

statement. The knife was not sent to the government analyst. The doctor said

that he could not say that the knife shown to him could have been used to stab

the deceased. The doctor could not tell whether the injuries were caused by a

single cutting-edge knife or a double side cutting edge knife.

9

All these items of circumstantial evidence do not pass the test that the evidence

must consist with the guilt of the appellant and inconsistent with any hypothesis

of his innocence. In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence, the

evidence must be consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with

any reasonable hypothesis of his innocence, (King vs Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254).

This principle was consistently followed in many other cases.

Considering the above circumstances, I hold that the evidence is insufficient to

convict the appellant. Therefore, the accused-appellant is acquitted.

The appeal is allowed.
