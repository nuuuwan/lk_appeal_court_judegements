This is a revision application against the order made by the learned High Court Judge of

Panadura in a revision application filed against an order made under Section 68 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act, No. 44 of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) by the

learned Magistrate of Panadura.

On 20.05.2015, Officer-In-Charge of the Miscellaneous Complaint Division of Panadura

Police Station filed an information in the Magistrates Court under Section 66 of the Act

pertaining to a dispute between the 1st Party Respondent-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the 1st Respondent) and the 2nd Party Respondent-Petitioner-

Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd Respondent) over the possession of a hotel

known as Lihiniya Beach Hotel. The 1st Respondent has alleged, inter alia, that he is the

owner of that hotel, the 2nd Respondent is a guest of it since January 2015, though, he paid

the hotel charges at the beginning later he defaulted the hotel charges, he repeatedly

requested from the 2nd Respondent to settle the arrears, ultimately, without settling arrears

the 2nd Respondent requested from him to accompany the 2nd Respondent and drop him to

a hotel nearby, on 22.03.2015. the 1st Respondent accompanied the 2nd Respondent to that

hotel and left him there, on the same day the 2nd Respondent forcibly re-entered into the 1st

Respondents hotel which is in dispute with the assistance of police dispossessing him from

the hotel, even though, the 1st Respondent was dispossessed from the property, his brother,

Amarasena who was employed by the 1st Respondent as the Manager of the hotel continued

to manage and control the hotel on behalf of the 1st Respondent, the 2nd Respondent, on

3

10.04.2015. chased away Amarasena also from the hotel and taken over the possession of

the hotel.

The 2nd Respondent, admitting the fact that he came to the hotel as a guest has alleged inter

alia, that he had negotiated with the 1st Respondent to purchase the hotel for Rs. 11 million

and paid Rs. 8 million, the parties entered into an agreement (marked as 25) on

10.02.2015. to execute the notarial deed for the property once the non-vesting and street

line certificates made available to the 2nd Respondent, on the day, which the agreement was

signed the 1st Respondent delivered the possession of the hotel to the 2nd Respondent, on

that day onwards the 2nd Respondent is possessing the property, on 22.03.2015, the 1st

Respondent abducted him when he was in the hotel, after making a complaint to the police

about the abduction the police intervened and restored the 2nd Respondent in possession of

the hotel.

It has been admitted by both the Respondents that the 2nd Respondent was in possession of

the hotel on 20.05.2015, the day on which the information was filed before the Magistrates

Court by the police. In addition to the affidavits, counter-affidavits and the documents filed

by both parties, oral evidence has been led before the Magistrates Court on document

marked as 2 5 as the 1st Respondent denied it. After holding a lengthy inquiry, leading

evidence of witnesses, the learned Magistrate, acting as the Primary Court Judge, by the

order dated 02.10.2018. has concluded that the 1st Respondent is entitled to the possession

of the hotel. Having aggrieved by that order, the 2nd Respondent filed revision application

bearing No. HC/REV/27/2018 in the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden

at Panadura. The learned High Court Judge, on 01.11.2018. made an order refusing to issue

notices of the revision application on the 1st Respondent and affirmed the order of the

learned Magistrate. By the revision application before this Court, the 2nd Respondent seeks

to revise the said orders of the learned Magistrate and the High Court Judge on the basis

that those orders are against the law and the facts of the case and therefore, a miscarriage

of justice/ failure of justice has been caused to him.

If a dispute between the parties reported to the primary court for the possession of a

property where the breach of the peace is threatened or likely, in terms of section 68 (1) of

the Act the Court should decide as to which party was in actual possession of the property

4

on the date of filing the information under section 66. When the dispute relates to right of

possession of a property, if the primary court judge is satisfied that the person who had

been in possession of the property has been dispossessed within a period of two months

prior to the information was filed, in terms of Section 68 (3) of the Act, he should decide

as to which party is entitled to the possession of the property.

In the instant action the respective parties are not at variance, that the 2nd Respondent was

in possession of the hotel on the date of filling the information in Court on 20.05.2015. The

position of the 1st Respondent is that the 2nd Respondent had occupied a room in the hotel

since January 2015 and even though, he was accompanied and dropped him to a nearby

hotel with his consent on 22.03.2015. by the 1st Respondent, on the same day with the

assistance of police the 2nd Respondent forcibly reentered into the hotel in dispute and

acquired possession of the hotel ejecting the 1st Respondent. The position of the 2nd

Respondent is that after executing the document marked as 2 5 on 10.02.2015, the 1st

Respondent placed him in possession of the hotel and from that date onwards until he was

forcibly dispossessed by the 1st Respondent on 22.03.2015. he was in the exclusive

possession of the hotel. Accordingly, both parties claim that they have independently

possessed the property until dispossessed by the opposing party on 22.03.2015. Since the

information has been filed on 20.05.2015. and the position of both parties has been that

they lost the possession on 23.05.2015, the learned Magistrate has correctly held that the

Court should make a determination under Section 68 (3) of the Act.

The parties do not dispute the fact that on the date of filing the information, the 2nd

Respondent was in possession of the hotel. The 1st Respondent claims inter alia, that he

was in possession of the hotel, the 2nd Respondent had occupied a room in the hotel as a

guest and after the 2nd Respondent had defaulted to pay the hotel charges the he had

accompanied the 2nd Respondent at his request to a nearby hotel on 22.03.2015 and dropped

him there. The 2nd Respondent claims inter alia, that he was in possession of the hotel since

10.02.2015. and he was forcibly dispossessed by the 1st Respondent on 22.03.2015. from

the hotel. Therefore, irrespective of the fact whether the 1st Respondent accompanied the

2nd Respondent at his request to a nearby hotel and dropped him there as alleged by the 1st

Respondent or the 2nd Respondent was forcibly dispossessed from the hotel as alleged by

5

the 2nd Respondent, it is relevant that on 22.03.2015, the 2nd Respondent has lost the

possession. The next important fact which the learned Magistrate had to consider was

whether the 2nd Respondent had been dispossessed from the exclusive possession of the

hotel or from a room of the hotel. If there has been evidence that the 2nd Respondent had

been dispossessed by the 1st Respondent from the hotel, the determination of the learned

Magistrate should be that the 2nd Respondent is entitled to the exclusive possession of the

hotel and if the evidence has been that he had been dispossessed from a room of the hotel

the determination should be that he is entitled to the possession of that particular room.

To establish the position of the 2nd Respondent that he was in exclusive possession of the

hotel till 22.03.2015. from 10.02.2015. he has relied on 2 5 which is an informal

document to demonstrate the fact that the 2nd Respondent had paid money to the 1st

Respondent to purchase the property and placed him in possession of the hotel. But the 1st

Respondent has denied the execution of that document. Therefore, the attesting witnesses

and the Notary Public who had allegedly been attested and executed the said document

have been called to give evidence before the Magistrates Court and they have denied the

attestation and the execution of that document. For that reason, the learned Magistrate has

correctly held that the authenticity and the execution of 2 5 document has not been

proved and therefore, that document should not be considered when determining the rights

of the parties.

In addition to the document marked as 2 5, the 2nd Respondent has tendered a copy of

a police complaint dated 13.03.2015. made against a lady alleging that she is occupying a

room in the hotel without paying the hotel charges. The 1st Respondent also has tendered a

copy of a police complaint dated 18.03.2015. which has also been lodged against a lady

alleging that she is staying in a room of the hotel without paying hotel charges. Further, the

2nd Respondent has tendered a police statement dated 16.03.2015. made by him which

states that after he took over the possession of the hotel on 10.02.2015, he continued to

obtain the services of the 1st Respondents brother, Amarasena as the manager of the hotel

and for the reason that Amarasena had cheated on him he asked Amarasena on 14.03.2015.

to resign and leave the hotel. The 2nd Respondent has further stated in that statement that

on the day which his services were terminated, the 1st Respondent came with a gang of

6

people and threatened him over the sacking of Amarasena from the hotel. Nevertheless, on

18.03.2015, a statement has been made by the 1st Respondent to the police stating that the

2nd Respondent borrowed Rs. 50,000/- from his brother, Amarasena and when he asked to

return the money a bogus complaint has been made by the 2nd Respondent to the police.

When determining the rights of the parties the learned Magistrate has considered the said

police complaints of the 2nd Respondent and the counter-complaints of the 1st Respondent.

The 1st Respondent, with his affidavit has tendered an affidavit as an annexure (marked as

X10) given by an owner of a hotel situated close to the hotel in dispute. The author of that

affidavit has affirmed that at the request of the 1st Respondent, the guests of the hotel of

the 1st Respondent used the swimming pool of his hotel up till the second week of April

2015 on payment of money by the 1st Respondent for using the pool by the guests. In the

annexed affidavits (marked as X11 and X12) to the affidavit and the counter-affidavit of the

1st Respondent which were given by two sanitary labourers states that they have worked in

the hotel in dispute under the 1st Respondent from February 2014 to March 2015. The

affidavit marked as X13 given by the gardener of the disputed hotel states that he has worked

for about one year till 22.03.2015. at the hotel for the 1st Respondent and his brother,

Amarasena. The chef of the hotel in dispute has given the affidavit marked as X16 to the

effect that he has worked in the hotel from January 2013 till 10.04.2015. under the 1st

Respondent. The 1st Respondent has tendered an affidavit (marked as X 21) given by the

lady against whom he had made the hereinbefore mentioned police complaint on

18.03.2015. which states that she had stayed in a room of the hotel in dispute managed by

the 1st Respondent with her mother and the 2nd Respondent had occupied the adjoining

room as a guest of the hotel and on 04.03.2015, the 1st Respondent had asked both of them

to pay the arrears of hotel charges.

Even though, the 2nd Respondent in his counter-affidavit has barely denied the facts stated

in the affidavit of the 1st Respondent and annexed affidavits tendered by the 1st Respondent

he has neither dealt with the facts stated in those affidavits separately nor given any reasons

as to why he denies those affidavits or the facts stated in those affidavits.

When weighing the above stated evidence, the Court could come to the conclusion that the

1st and the 2nd Respondent had been in possession of the hotel and a room of the hotel

7

respectively to the 22.03.2015, the day on which both parties allege that they had been

dispossessed by the opposing party and when the police intervened and restored the 2nd

Respondent back in possession on that day, he had been restored in possession exclusively

in the hotel ejecting the 1st Respondent from the possession of the hotel. Therefore, I hold

that the 1st Respondent is entitled to the possession of the hotel and the 2nd Respondent is

entitled to the possession of a room of the hotel.

The wisdom of the legislature by enacting the provisions in Part VII of the Act is preventing

the breaches of peace arising from land disputes. Therefore, if the Court holds that the 2nd

Respondent is entitled to possess a room in the hotel which the 1st Respondent is entitled

to possess, there would be practical difficulties in exercising their rights and the threat to

the maintenance of peace between the parties would continue. Therefore, it is appropriate

to conclude that the party who has the title to the property is entitled to possess the property.

According to the decision of Ramalingam Vs. Thangarajah (1982) 2 S.L.R. 693, when

the evidence about possession is clearly balanced, the primary court judge could consider

the evidence about the title and come to the conclusion that the party who has the title to

the property is entitled to the possession of it until the rights of the parties are determined

by a competent court.

In the instant case, the 2nd Respondent has admitted the paper title of the 1st Respondent

and the 1st Respondent has produced his title deeds of the property (marked as X and X1)

and the Certificate of Business Registration of the hotel (marked as X2) issued in his name

under the Companies Act.

After considering all the above stated facts, I hold that the determination of the learned

Magistrate that the 1st Respondent is entitled to possess the property in dispute, Lihiniya

Beach Hotel and the order made by the learned High Court Judge refusing to issue notices

on the revision application on the 1st Respondent are according to the facts of the case and

the law. Even though, the manner which this Court has analysed the evidence of the case

is different in the manner which the learned Magistrate has analysed the evidence, there is

no difference between the conclusions of both Courts. Therefore, no prejudice has been

caused to the parties in the manner which the evidence has been analysed by the learned

Magistrate. Considering all the above stated facts, I hold that the impugned order dated

8

02.10.2018. of the learned Magistrate is according to the facts of the case and the law and

therefore, the order dated 01.11.2018. of the learned High Court Judge on the revision

application refusing to issue notices on the 1st Respondent is according to the law. For the

reason that the 2nd Respondent has failed to satisfy this Court that a positive miscarriage of

justice or failure of justice has been caused to him for this Court to intervene to rectify the

orders of the Magistrates Court and the High Court to make sure due administration of

justice, I hold that exceptional circumstances do not exist for this Court to exercise its

revisionary jurisdiction. Therefore, I affirm the impugned orders of the learned Magistrate

and the High Court Judge and dismiss the revision application. The 2nd Respondent will

pay Rs. 10 000/= as the cost of this Court to the 1st Respondent.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

I agree.
