S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

By this Appeal the Appellant-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Appellants)

seek to set aside the Order of the Divisional Secretary of Hanguranketha, (the

Respondent-Respondent and hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) dated

22.09.2009 regarding the amount of compensation for a land acquired from the

Appellants in terms of section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act, No. 9 of 1950 as

amended (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and the Order dated 15.03.2019. of the

Land Acquisition Board of Review (hereinafter referred to as the Board) made in

appeal against the order of the Respondent. By the impugned Order dated 22.09.2009,

the Respondent has concluded that the Appellants should be entitled to a sum of Rs.

14,000,000|= (Rupees Fourteen Million) which is the State valuation as compensation

for the land acquired from them. The Appellants are the co-owners of the land known

and identified as Joansland Estate. A portion of that land in extent of approximately

92 Acres which is the subject matter of the action has been acquired to build houses

for the people of the area who lost their houses due to landslides. Joansland Estate is

situated in the Poramadulla village in Nuwara-eliya District. The claim of the

Appellants before the Respondent for the acquisition was Rs. 736,000,000|= (Rupees

736 million) i.e., at the rate of Rs. 50,000|= per Perch. Being dissatisfied with the

quantum of compensation determined by the Respondent, the Appellants preferred an

Appeal to the Board seeking to enhance that amount. By the impugned Order dated

15.03.2019, the Board has increased it up to sum of Rs. 27,585,000|= (Rupees 27

million and 585 thousand). Being dissatisfied with that amount, the Appellants

preferred this Appeal to this Court in terms of section 28 of the Act seeking further

enhancement.

The learned Counsel for the Appellants submitted that the compensation determined

by the Board is per se bad in law and contrary to the provisions of section 45 (1) of

the Act for the reason that the computation of compensation has not been done using

the correct Method of assessing the market value of the land and even though, on

behalf of the Appellants two alternative valuation options were suggested those

valuations were not considered by the Board.

In terms of the Act, a person from whom a land is acquired is entitled to the market

value of the land as compensation. Section 45 (1) of the Act, which sets out the mode

of assessing the market value of a land is as follows;

for the purposes of this Act, the market value of a land in respect of which a notice

under section 7 has been published shall, subject as hereinafter provided, be the

amount which the land might be expected to have realized if sold by a willing seller in

the open market as a separate entity on the date of publication of that notice in the

Gazette.

Sections 45, 46, 46A, 47 and 48 deals with elaborate provisions in assessing

compensation and the matters which should be considered in deciding the quantum of

compensation.

The learned Counsel for the Appellants submitted that the land has been valued for

the Appellants by the Valuer, Mr. Kaleel as a land which could be used for the

agricultural purposes as well as the construction purposes. The learned Counsel has

submitted that if the land is valued applying the Comparison Method as an

agricultural land, the minimum market value of a Perch would be Rs. 5,000|= and if it

is valued applying the Residual Method as a land which could be used for housing

development it would attract minimum value of Rs. 11,000|= per Perch whereas the

Board has valued it at the rate of Rs. 1,875|= per Perch. The learned Counsel further

submitted that in the year 2000, another portion of the same Joansland Estate was

acquired from the Appellants awarding them Rs 3,258|= per Perch and after 7 years,

in the year 2007, the decision to pay at the rate of Rs 1,875|= per Perch is contrary to

common sense. Under such circumstances, the learned Counsel argues that the Board

has not adopted a coherent and reasonable methodology in valuing the compensation

and no rational and common sense explanation has been given as to how the land was

valued. The learned Counsel further argues that the valuation does not reflect the

5

market value of the land and therefore, seek to enhance the amount of the

compensation to Rs. 6,500|= per Perch even though, Rs. 50,000|= per Perch has been

claimed by the Appellants before the Respondent.

The learned Senior State Counsel appearing for the Respondent submitted inter alia,

that the area which the land in question is situated has no proper infrastructure

facilities, since the land consists of hilly and sloppy areas the cost on infrastructure

facilities would be excessive, the National Building and Research Organization

(NBRO), taking into consideration the geographical, geological and the topographical

situation of the land has recommended that only 1/3rd of the land is suitable for

construction and the land is prone to landslides. Therefore, the learned SSC argues

that the land could not be valued on the basis that the entirety of it could be used for

construction of houses. The learned Senior State Counsel submitted that at the earlier

acquisition in 2000, the compensation was calculated at the rate of Rs. 3,258|= per

Perch considering that it is a tea Estate, the land acquired for the construction of

houses is a neglected land and even if a tea plantation is done on the subject matter

converting it to a suitable land for tea plantation, a considerable period of time would

require to pluck the tender leaves of tea. Under such circumstances, he argues that a

scientific and intelligible methodology has been adopted by the Board in computing

the quantum of compensation and therefore, the compensation determined by the

Board is adequate and reasonable.

According to the observation No. 2 mentioned in the NBRO report (page 263 of the

Appeal Brief) the subject land consists of hill and flat areas, slopes in different

degrees and valleys. When considering the said topographical and geological situation

of the land and the landslides which were occurring during the past several years in

the area in which the subject land is situated, in terms of section 114 of the Evidence

Ordinance, the Court can presume that the land is situated in an area which is prone to

landslides.

At the inquiry before the Board, the two Valuers who had prepared the valuation

reports on behalf of both parties have testified. Mr. Kaleel, a Private Valuer who had

prepared the valuation report (marked as A12, at page 346) for the Appellants has

valued the entire land for Rs. 159,772,871/= (Rupees one hundred and fifty-nine

million seven hundred and seventy-two thousand and eight hundred and seventy-one),

6

at the rate of Rs. 11,000/= per Perch on the basis that the land could be blocked out

for 350 lots and develop it for a housing project (pages 7 and 10 of the inquiry

proceedings on 22.4.2014 and 17.06.2014 respectively). At the beginning of his

evidence the witness has testified that even though, a hypothetical blocking out plan

had not been drawn up by him to prepare his valuation report, after considering a

blocking out plan obtained from the Urban Development Authority (UDA) he had

prepared his valuation report (inquiry proceedings before the Board on 17.06.2014.

page 10). Nevertheless, the witness has admitted later that the UDA did not have a

blocking out plan to the date on which he had prepared his valuation report and

testified that assuming that the UDA possesses a blocking out plan which consists of

350 lots he had prepared his valuation report (inquiry proceedings on 17.06.2014 page

11). But later he has testified that he did not obtain a plan from the UDA (proceedings

on the same day page 13). Although, he has admitted in cross-examinati5 on that he

had not prepared a hypothetical blocking out plan to do the valuation, on the next date

of inquiry, in re-examination he has testified that he had prepared a hypothetical

blocking out plan and produced it marked as A3 (proceedings on 31.07.2014. page 3).

On a consideration of that plan, it is clear that it is not a plan which is prepared by the

UDA but, a plan which is prepared by the Surveyor General for the purpose of the

acquisition of the subject matter. When considering the above stated evidence, it is

clear that the testimony of the witness is contradictory per se on the important facts.

In addition to that, there is no material before the Court to prove that the witness had

gone to the land more than one occasion. Therefore, it is hard to believe that after

visiting the land once the witness was able consider the different topographical and

geographical levels of the land in extent of 92 Acres to prepare a hypothetical

blocking out plan which consists of 350 lots. In addition to that it is important to draw

the attention of Court to the Certificate of Consent tendered to the Board at the

inquiry on behalf of the Appellants which has been issued by the Tea, Rubber and

Coconut Estates Board instituted under the Tea, Rubber and Coconut Estates Board

(Control of Fragmentation) Act, No. 20 of 2005 (marked as A8a page 352). In that

document the consent has been given to divide the land into the blocks of minimum

extent of 2 Acres for the agricultural purposes only. That Certificate has been issued

on 10.10.2006 i.e., long before Mr. Kaleel had prepared his valuation report. Mr.

Kaleel, in his testimony has admitted that before he prepared his valuation report he

knew about that Certificate but it was not considered when preparing the valuation

7

report (page 6 proceedings on 17.06.2014). Therefore, it is clear that the witness has

suggested to block out the land for 350 lots for housing development without taking

into consideration the conditions imposed by the Tea, Rubber and Coconut Estates

Board about the blocking out of the land and the purpose which it should be utilized.

Mr. Kaleel has testified inter alia, that he has proposed to provide 10 to 30 feet wide

road accesses to the blocking out lots, 500 meters of land area would be sufficient to

cover the ground area of the roads (proceedings on 17.06.2014. page 13) and the total

cost for construction of roads would be Rs. 10 Lakhs (16.07.2015. proceedings page

8). Nevertheless, the Court cannot believe and accept the evidence of the witness that

to provide 10 to 30 feet wide roads 500 meters of the land area and spending Rs. 10

Lakhs would be sufficient. When considering the above stated evidence of Mr. Kaleel

which is contradictory and hard to believe, the Court cannot treat him as a trustworthy

witness. Under such circumstances, the Court cannot accept the valuation report

prepared by Mr. Kaleel on behalf of the Appellants.

On behalf of the Respondent, a State Valuer had prepared a valuation report (pages

180 - 184 in the Appeal Brief) using the Direct Comparison Method and valued the

land for Rs. 14,000,000/= (Rupees 14 million). According to the evidence of the State

Valuer, Mr. Dampe who has assisted the Chief Valuer in valuing the subject matter of

the action even though, there are other Methods which could be used to value the

lands, he has chosen the Direct Comparison Method being the most appropriate and

suitable Method to assess the market value of the subject matter. The reasons given by

the witness for using that Method are inter alia, that when considering the

geographical and topographical situation of the land, it is difficult to develop in order

to gain profits, the extent of the land is large, its a barren land without any plantation

which has a monetary value, according to the MBRO report only 30% to 35% of the

land area is suitable for construction and the Tea, Rubber and Coconut Estates Board

has given consent to divide the land into the blocks of minimum extent of 2 Acres

only for agricultural purposes. In valuing the subject matter, the State Valuer has

taken into consideration the face value of a deed of transfer (marked as R11a) which

was executed by the Appellants for a portion of the same Johnsland Estate for an

extent of 10 Acres 2 Roods and 38.7 Perches. The witness has produced at the inquiry

before the Board another deed (marked as R11b) which was executed by the

Appellants for another portion of the same Estate for an extent of 12 Acres 8.5

8

Perches to corroborate his evidence that the valuation done by using the deed marked

as R11a is realistic and reasonable. On behalf of the Appellants, four deeds which

were executed for the portions of Johnsland Estate had been produced marked as A13

to A16 before the Board to corroborate the valuation for Appellants. The extent of the

lands mentioned in the deeds other than the deed marked as A13 is about 15 Perches.

Therefore, when considering the extent of the lands transferred by those deeds, it is

clear that those lands were purchased for construction purposes and not for

agricultural purposes. Anyhow, the possibility of valuing the subject land employing

the Direct Comparison Method after taking into consideration the transfer values of

those deeds has not been questioned from State Valuer, Mr. Dampe. When drawing

the attention of Court to the hereinbefore mentioned reasons given by Mr. Dampe for

using the Direct Comparison Method, I am of the view that the transfer values

mentioned in deeds which are dealt with larger extents of lands are more realistic than

the transfer values mentioned in deeds which are dealt with smaller extents in

calculating the market value using the Direct Comparison Method.

It was held in the case of Perera (G.A., N.W.P.) vs. Fernando et al., (51 NLR 121) that

in deciding the market value, the evidence of recent sales in the vicinity is an

important test, provided that such sales were property, similarly situated and are

shown to have been by a willing seller to a willing buyer.

The evidence of Mr. Dampe is that the consideration of transfer value mentioned in

the deed marked R11a was sufficient to assess the market value of the property and

the valuation done on that deed corroborates the transfer value mentioned in the deed

marked as R11b. The parties have agreed that the relevant date for valuation of the

land acquired is 20th December 2007. The deeds marked as R11a and R11b were

executed on 1st November 2006 and on 6th June 2009 respectively. Therefore, it is

clear that the transactions on R11a and R11b had been taken place respectively about

one year prior and 1 years later to the relevant date for the valuation. The face value

of the deed marked as R11a is Rs. 2,000,000/= for 10 Acres 2 Roods 37.8 Perches.

Therefore, the value of an Acre is Rs. 186,285/=. By the deed marked as R11b an

extent of 12 Acres and 8.5 Perches had been transferred for Rs. 1,200,000|= and

therefore, the value of an Acre dealt with that deed is Rs. 99,520/=. The Valuer has

valued an Acre of the subject matter of instant action for Rs. 152,182|= and the entire

9

land which is approximately 92 Acres in extent for Rs. 14 million. Therefore, when

comparing the transfer values of an Acre mentioned in deeds R11a and R11b with the

compensation suggested by the Valuer for an Acre, the Court can be satisfied that the

decision of the Respondent that the Appellants should be entitled to Rs. 14 million as

compensation for the entire acquisition is reasonable, realistic and adequate and in

terms of section 45 (1) of the Act it is the market value of the subject land.

The Board has refused to accept the State Valuation on the basis that the transactions

taken place on deeds marked as R11a and R11b were within the members of the

Appellants family and therefore, the market value does not reflect on those deeds.

Even though, the Valuer Mr. Kaleel has given evidence before the Board neither the

Appellants nor the vendees of those deeds have given evidence. Mr. Kaleel has stated

that the transactions were taken place on those deeds within the members of the

Appellants family.

In terms of section 50 of the Evidence Ordinance, when the relationship of a person to

another is relevant, the opinion of a family member or any other person who has

special means of knowledge on that relationship is relevant. In the action in hand,

there had not been evidence before the Board that Mr. Kaleel is a relative of the

Appellants or how he has acquired knowledge that the parties to those deeds are

relatives. Furthermore, the Notarys Certificate in the deed marked as R11a

demonstrates the fact that the consideration mentioned in that deed has been passed

before the Notary. Under the said circumstances, I hold that the Board has come to the

conclusion that the parties to the deeds marked as R11a and R11b are relatives and

therefore, the market value of the property does not reflect in those deeds were not

based on evidence adduced before the Board.

Taking into consideration the compensation paid to the Appellants on a previous

acquisition of 8 Acres of Johnsland Estate for the playground of the Poramadulla

Central College, the Board has come to the conclusion that the Appellants should be

entitled to a sum of Rs. 27,585,000/= as compensation. But the Valuers who are

experts in valuing lands have not been examined as to whether the land acquired for

the playground could be compared with the land acquired in the instant action when

computing the valuation of the subject matter. Even though, there is no proof before

the Board about the topographical and geographical situation of the land acquired for

10

the playground, on the assumptions that it is a flat land, in deciding the compensation

tea plantation of that land had been considered and even if a tea plantation is done in

the subject land considerable period of time would take to pluck tea, the Board has

come to its conclusion about the quantum of compensation for the subject matter of

the action. Therefore, I hold that the Board has come to a conclusion about the

quantum of compensation arbitrary on the assumptions and without any proof to

support its conclusion. However, the Respondent has not taken up the position in the

Appeal that the compensation ordered by the Board is excessive and the learned

Senior State Counsel for the Respondent has argued that the quantum of

compensation ordered by the Board is fair and reasonable. Since the Respondent do

not dispute the quantum of the compensation ordered by the Board, I affirm the Order

of the Board and hold that the Appellants are entitled to a sum of Rs. 27,585,000/= as

compensation for the entire acquisition. I set aside the Order of the Respondent. No

costs ordered.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

I agree.
