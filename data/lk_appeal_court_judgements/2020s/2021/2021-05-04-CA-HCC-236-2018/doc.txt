Devika Abeyratne.J

The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) in this case was

indicted on counts 1 to 4 of the indictment which are as follows;

1. Between 11th May 2012 and 16th May 2012 while serving as the Divisional

Secretary Akurana, for solicitation of Rs. 50,000/- as gratification from

Asanaka Ranawana for the purpose of granting approval of a license to a

metal quarry, an offence punishable under Section 19 (b) of the Bribery Act.

2. At the time, place and in the course of the same transaction being a public

servant for soliciting 50,000/- as gratification from Asanka Ranawana an

offence punishable under Section 19 (c) of the Bribery Act.

3. On 16.05.2012 in the course of the same transaction as the Divisional

Secretary Akurana accepting a gratification of Rs. 50,000/- through the 2nd

accused from Asanka Ranawana for the purpose of granting approval of a

license to a metal quarry, an offence punishable under Section 19 (b) of the

Bribery Act.

4. At the time, place and in the course of the same transaction being a public

servant for accepting a gratification of Rs. 50,000/- from Asanka Ranawana

an offence punishable under Section 19 (c) of the Bribery Act.

The 2nd accused was indicted for the 5th and 6th counts for aiding and abetting the

appellant to commit the offences specified in counts 3 and 4. He admitted liability to

both charges and was imposed a sentence of one year rigorous imprisonment for each

charge separately, suspended for 7 years and a fine of Rs,5000/- each with a default

sentence of one year.

The learned trial judge after trial, convicted the appellant on counts 2 and 4. He

was acquitted from counts 1 and 3 on the basis that the official act set out in counts 1

and 3 had already been performed by the appellant by the time the solicitation for the

illegal gratification was made.

For the 2nd and 4th counts which is for soliciting an illegal gratification of Rs.

50,000/- while serving as a public servant he was sentenced as follows,

Count [2] 5 years Rigorous Imprisonment

Rs.5000/- fine [one year Rigorous imprisonment in default]

Count [4] 5 years Rigorous Imprisonment

Rs. 5000/- fine [one year Rigorous imprisonment in default]

Both sentences to run concurrently.

A Further fine of 50,000/- was imposed under Section 26 of the Bribery Act with

a default Sentence of 1 year Rigorous Imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the accused appellant has

appealed to this court.

The facts of the case can be summarized as follows; PW 01 the complainant is a

businessman who owns a metal quarry at Akurana situated close to his residence.

Previously, his now deceased father had carried on the business. On 01.02.2012, the

complainant has applied for his annual license for the year 2012 which was received by

the Divisional Secretary on 03.02.2012 and on 10.02.2012 the license had been

recommended. It was submitted that approval from the other authorities is based on this

recommendation.

5

According to PW 1, when he responded to a missed telephone call on his mobile

phone it had been answered by one Hashima (PW 05) an employee from the Divisional

Secretariat of Akurana.

Hashima (PW 05) is known to the complainant as an employee of the Divisional

Secretariat who used to handle the file pertaining to the Quarry. She has informed that

the newly appointed Divisional Secretary wants to speak to him and given the phone to

the person who identified himself as the Divisional Secretary.

Thereafter, the person who identified himself as the Divisional Secretary, on the

telephone has solicited a sum of Rs. 50,000/- and had indicated that his assistance will

be required to the complainant in future too to carry on his business and had requested

for the money before Thursday. PW 01 who had indicated he would be able to settle a

sum of about Rs 30,000/-, had informed the Bribery Commission and a trap had been

arranged on 16.05.2012.

As arranged with the officials of the Bribery Commission, the complainant

together with officer Pathiraja who acted as Manju, (the employee of PW 01 who

attended to matters in the Divisional Secretariat, who is also alleged to have been

informed to convey a message to PW 01 to meet with the Divisional Secretary by the

officer who handled the file.) had visited the Secretariat.

At the office of the Divisional Secretary, PW 01 had been asked whether he

brought Rs. 50,000/- by the Divisional Secretary, who was identified in the Dock as the

accused. Thereafter, PW 01 and officer Patrhiraja were directed to the Quarters of the

Divisional Secretary which was situated on the upper floor of the Secretariat. They were

taken there by a peon named Cader. After a while, they were again asked to come to

6

the office of the Divisional Secretary and was told by him to proceed to the house of

the complainant and that the money would be collected there. When PW 01 and the

officer were waiting at his residence (the Quarry is also in the same premises 150 meters

away) Hashima has contacted him over the phone to inform that Sir will be coming

around 4 pm.

PW 2, Officer Pathirajah has been stationed near the crusher. The Divisional

Secretary has come with some others. He and another fair complexioned person with

the complainant had been walking towards the crusher when the appellant asked

whether the Rs.50,000/- was there and instructed him to give it to the fair complexioned

person who was with them. The money had been given to that person who was

instructed by the appellant to take the money.

After the money was given as instructed the signal was given and officer

Seneviratne, of the Bribery commission with the other officers have come and arrested

the appellant and the other person who was with him. The person who was given the

money on the instruction of the Divisional Secretary was identified as Ali the 2nd

accused who admitted liability at the trial.

PW 02 Pathirajah has corroborated the evidence of PW 01 (page 213/214). He

has testified that when the person who was in a sarong was arrested he had stated that

the money was taken on the instructions of the Divisional Secretary.

This statement was corroborated by PW 03 Senaviratne the Officer-In-Charge

of the raid. He also testified that the money was recovered from the person who was

subsequently named and identified as the 2nd accused who admitted liability to the

charge, before the commencement of the trial.

There were several other prosecution witnesses including PW 05 Hashima. On

perusal of the evidence of Hashima it is noted that neither party has elicited any

important evidence from this witness. It appears that as the learned judge has

commented in his judgment , considering the relationship between PW 05 and the

appellant , prosecution may have had good reason not to pose too many questions to

PW 05.

PW 08 Abdul Cader has testified that he accompanied the complainant and

another person to the private quarters of the Divisional Secretary and later brought them

back to the office. This had been at the request of the appellant.

PW 09 Ismail Lebbe Mohomed, is a Grama Sevaka who was present when the

Divisional Secretary was arrested. He had been seated at the back seat of the cab with

the 2nd accused, when the officers of the Bribery Commission arrested the 2nd accused

and the Divisional Secretary. His evidence that he was not watching what was taking

place as he was disturbed by the turn of events is hard to believe specially coming from

a Grama Sevaka, which indicated he was an uncooperative witness.

The appellant has made a lengthy statement from the Dock and denied the

charges levelled against him.

8

The following grounds of appeal were urged on behalf of the appellant.

1. A Large volume of evidence incriminating the Accused Appellant was based on

a conversation between an employee of the Office Divisional Secretary, named

Hashima and Complainant. The Learned Trial Judge failed to consider is impact

on the evidence against the accused appellant when the prosecution did not lead

the evidence of the said Hashima regarding the said conversations, though she

was called as a witness for the prosecution.

2. The Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself when referring to the fact that there

was no cross examination of the said witness Hashima by the defence regarding

the conversations between the complainant and the witness.

3. The Learned Trial Judge failed to consider the impact on the case for the

prosecution when the prosecution purposely declined to lead the evidence of

witness Hashima on the items of evidence already elicited from the Complainant

regarding the conversations with her.

4. The learned Trial Judge failed to analyze the evidence of the decoy, Police

Sergeant Pathiraja and the Chief Investigating Officer Police Inspector

Seneviratne, in view of the discrepancies between the evidence of the

Complainant and the officers of the Bribery Commission.

5. The Learned Trial Judge failed to pay attention to the evidence of witness

Hashima that there were complainants against the Quarry of the Complainant

that were investigated by the Divisional Secretariat as a cause for false

implication.

6. Due to one or more of the reasons set out above the Accused Appellant was

denied fair trial.

9

The first to three grounds of appeal above focuses on the failure of the learned

judge to consider that there is no evidence elicited from Hashima by the prosecution

regarding her alleged introduction of the appellant to the complainant and her direct

involvement which culminated in this action.

The learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the appellant contended that as

the prosecution failed to lead the evidence of witness Hashima (PW 5) to elicit evidence

on the conversation she is alleged to have had with the complainant, it is hearsay

evidence and not admissible.

It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the evidence pertaining to

Hashima s alleged conversation with the complainant was allowed by the learned trial

judge after it was informed that she was a witness. Thereafter a large volume of evidence

that would not have been admissible if Hashima was not a witness had been led.

However PW 5 has not been questioned on the conversation she was alleged to have

had with the complainant and as a result prejudice was caused to the appellant and

that the learned trial Judge failed to consider that issue.

The evidence elicited from PW 1 transpires that PW 5 has played an important

role in the entire transaction. Even on the date of the raid she is said to have been in

contact with PW 1 passing on messages about the arrival of the appellant and with

regard to the payment of money.

For whatever reason this evidence was not elicited from PW 5 to corroborate the

evidence of PW 1. It stands to reason therefore, as the learned DSG has admitted, that

the evidence of PW 1, on what was communicated by PW 5 was hearsay evidence.

Nevertheless, it appears that PW 1 on what he perceived from the said communication

had taken action to inform the Bribery Commission and pursued with the information

he gathered, which evidence is admissible.

10

It is also to be considered that the appellant if he so wished could have elicited

evidence enuring to his benefit from PW 5 as she was available for cross examination.

The learned trial judge has quite correctly analyzed the evidence and had

concluded as follows;

In Page 511 of the brief ;

. .

.

Considering the above, the ground of appeal that the appellant was denied

a fair trial has no merit.

The 5th ground of appeal is that the learned trial judge failed to pay attention to

the evidence of Hashima that there were complaints against the Quarry and they were

being considered by the appellant. Upon perusal of the evidence clearly indicate that

some general questions have been asked about complaints regarding the Quarry. But

has not elicited information about any serious complaints. There were no specific

incidents or complaints referred to. Anyhow, by the time the site was visited the license

had already been issued and there was no necessity or reason whatsoever to visit the

site for an inspection. Accordingly, that grounds of appeal also has no merit.

The learned Presidents Counsel had contended that the prosecution was

under a duty to call the 2nd accused as a witness, who has admitted liability to the charges

against him. It is for the prosecution to decide to call witnesses as the burden is on the

11

prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, it cannot be

considered as a valid ground of appeal.

In the instant case the main witness was PW 01.

In Sunil Vs AG 1999 (3) SLR page 191 it was held;

1. It is trite law that the trial Judge who hears a bribery trial is entitled

to convict on the sole testimony of a prosecution witness without any

corroboration provided he is impressed with the cogency, convincing

character of the evidence and the testimonial trustworthiness of the

sole witness.

2. It is an incorrect statement of the law to hold that a reasonable

doubt arises on the mere fact that the prosecution case rested on the

uncorroborated evidence of a solitary prosecution witness.

In Walimunige John and Another vs State 76 NLR 488 held;

The question of a presumption arises only where a witness whose

evidence is necessary to unfold the narrative is withheld by the '

prosecution and the failure to call such witness constitutes a vital missing

link in the prosecution case and where the reasonable inference to be

drawn from the omission to call the witness is that he would, if called, not

have supported the prosecution. But where one witness's evidence is

cumulative of the other and would be a mere repetition of the narrative, it

would be wrong to direct a jury that the failure to call such witness gives

rise to a presumption under section 114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance."

12

King vs Chalo Singho 42 NLR Page 269 has held;

Prosecuting Counsel is not bound to call all the witnesses named on the

back of the indictment or tender them for cross-examination. In

exceptional circumstances the presiding Judge may ask the prosecuting

Counsel to call such a witness or may call him as a witness of the Court.

In the light of the above authorities it is apparent that the prosecution had

no compelling reason to call the second accused as a prosecution witness.

The fourth ground of appeal is that the learned trial judge has failed to consider

the omissions and the discrepancies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.

The learned Presidents Counsel has referred to the discrepancies such as the

colour of the vehicle, the signal that was given to the officers and has submitted that

the learned judge, should have been cautious when the bare testimony of the decoy

and complainant was considered.

On perusal of the judgement it is apparent that the learned trial judge has

carefully and extensively analysed and evaluated the omissions and contradictions and

considered meticulously the acceptable evidence which in my view cannot be faulted.

The trial judge has considered the Dock Statement very carefully and rejected

same giving established legal basis for the rejection.

It is admitted that the visit to the Divisional Secretariat by the complainant was

after the recommendation was obtained. According to the complainant the reason to

visit the Secretariat was the Divisional Secretarys request for him to come with the

solicited money. The evidence is that the complainant and the decoy was sent to the

private quarters of the Divisional Secretary on his request which was corroborated by

the evidence of Cader the peon of the Divisional Secretary. If the request for the

13

complainant was to come for an official inquiry, there was no reason for him to be sent

to the official quarters of the appellant.

The argument that the reason for the appellant to visit the Quarry was to inspect

it cannot stand as the license was already issued by that time and there was no cogent

reason for the appellant to inspect the Quarry. There is no plausible explanation why

the appellant visited the Quarry on that day.

As the learned Trial Judge has considered all the evidence properly, we see no

reason to interfere with the finding and conclusion of the trial judge.

Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction and the sentence

imposed by the learned High Court Judge.
