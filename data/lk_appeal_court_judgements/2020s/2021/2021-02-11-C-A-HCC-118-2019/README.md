This is an appeal by the accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved by the judgment dated 20-02-2019 and the

sentence imposed in consequence to the judgment on him by the learned High

Court Judge of Colombo.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Colombo for causing the

death of one R.A.Rathnasiri on or about 31 st October 2009, thereby committing

the offence of Murder, punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code. However,

from the impugned judgment the learned High Court judge found him guilty of

the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under section 297 of

the Penal Code.

After considering the submissions of the parties as to the sentence, the learned

trial judge sentenced the appellant for a term of 18 years rigorous imprisonment

and also imposed a fine of rupees 50,000/-.

At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant who is in the remand custody was not

produced by the prison authorities due to the COVID pandemic situation

prevalent in the country. However, the learned counsel for the appellant

informed the Court that he has full instructions from the appellant to argue his

appeal before us, which resulted in hearing the parties in consideration of the

appeal. Even though the accused was physically not present in Court, he had

the opportunity of observing the proceedings from the prison premises via a video

link from Zoom virtual platform.

At a later stage of the hearing and at the request of the learned counsel for the

appellant, the matter was adjourned for enable him to obtain further instructions

from the appellant. On the resumption of the arguments, it was informed by the

learned counsel that he has instructions from the appellant that the appellant

is no longer pursuing the appeal with regard to the conviction, but only on the

sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge. As a result of the said stand,

this Court proceeded to affirm the conviction and allowed the parties to make

their submissions as to the sentence imposed by the learned High Court judge.

It was the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the appellant

is a partially deaf person of 57 years of age, who surrendered to the Police soon

after the incident. It was submitted that the evidence suggests that the appellant

and the deceased were in fact friends, and the incident was a result of a sudden

quarrel and that the appellant had no murderous intention. The learned counsel

brought to the notice of the Court the established facts that both the deceased

and the appellant had been after liquor and the appellant also had suffered

injuries during the altercation.

It was further submitted that the appellant was in remand custody for a period

of over two and half years from the date of the incident until he was granted bail.

3

It was urged by the learned counsel for the appellant to consider the above

circumstances in considering the revision of the sentence imposed on the

accused, which in his view was excessive.

It was the contention ofthe learned Additional Solicitor General who represented

the Attorney General that the Court should be mindful of injuries suffered by the

deceased at the hand of the appellant, although it may have been a result of a

sudden altercation between the deceased and the appellant. The learned

Additional Solicitor General also points out the established fact that the deceased

has attempted to get away from the appellant in order to escape the attack and

was a disabled person. He invited the Court to consider these factors in deciding

the appropriateness of the sentence imposed on the appellant.

It has to be noted that although the original charge against the appellant was

one of murder, punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code, eventually it

was under the provisions of section 297 of the Penal Code he has been found

guilty and sentenced.

Section 297 of the Penal Code, which stipulates the punishment for culpable

homicide not amounting to murder reads as follows;

297. Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder

shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term

which may extend to twenty years, and shall also be liable to fine, if

the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of

causing death, or causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause

death;

Or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

extend to ten years, or with fine, or with both, if the act is done with

the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any

intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to

cause death.

In the case of Ravij Vs. State of Rajastan (1996) 2 see 175, it was held that;

"It is the nature and gravity of the crime and not the criminal which are germane

for consideration of appropriate punishment in a criminal case.

The Court will be failing in duty if appropriate punishment is not awarded for a

crime which has been committed not only against the individual victim but also

against the society to which the criminal and victim belong. "

In M Gomes Vs. W.V.D. Leelaratne 66 NLR 233 it was stated that;

"A judge in determining the proper sentence should first consider the gravity of the

offence as it appears from the nature of the act itself. Should have regard to the

punishment provided in the Penal Code or the Statute under which he is charged."

When it comes to the facts of the instant case and the judgment, it is clear that

the appellant has been convicted for an offence punishable under section 297 of

the Penal Code on the basis of exception 4 of section 294 of the Penal Code.

However, I am very much mindful of the grievous nature of the injuries suffered

by the deceased and the necessity to consider the rights of the victims of crime

and the society at large while considering the imposition of appropriate

punishment.

Given the aggravating and mitigatory factors mentioned before, and the basis

upon which the appellant has been convicted for culpable homicide not

amounting to murder, I am of the view that the sentence of 18 years rigorous

imprisonment out of the maximum 20-year period that can be imposed under

section 297 of the Penal Code is excessive.

In consideration of all the mitigatory factors pleaded on behalf of the appellant

and the submissions of the learned Additional Solicitor General, I find that a

period of 15 years rigorous imprisonment would be an adequate punishment for

the offence for which the appellant was convicted.

5

"

Therefore, I vary the sentence imposed on the appellant by imposing a 15-year

rigorous imprisonment on the appellant, to be effective from 20-02-2019, the

date on which the appellant was sentenced. The fine and the default sentence

shall remain the same.

The appeal against the sentence is allowed subject to the above variance to the

sentence.

K Priyantha Fernando, J.

I agree.
