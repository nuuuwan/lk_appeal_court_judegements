The 1st accused appellant has preferred this appeal seeking to set

aside the judgement dated 25.06.2018 of the learned High Court Judge

of Kegalle convicting him for murder in case Number HC 3015/2010 in

the High Court of Kegalle.

The 1st accused appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the appellant) along with 3 other accused were indicted for the following

charges before the High Court of Kegalle.

1. That on or about the 19th of June 2008 committed the offence of

murder, by causing the death of one Unagolla Devage Somapala,

3

an offence punishable under Section 296 to be read with section

32 of the Penal Code.

2. That on or about the 19th of June 2008 committed the offence of

attempt to murder, by causing injuries to Hewayalage

Kamalawathi, an offence punishable under section 300 to be read

with section 32 of the Penal code.

At the conclusion of the trial, the 1st accused appellant was

convicted for murder on the first count and sentenced to death and was

acquitted on count 2. The 2nd to the 4th accused were acquitted and

discharged from both counts.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence the appellant

has preferred the instant appeal on the following grounds of appeal.

i. Evidence of star witness PW 15 namely Dhanapala is plagued

with serious infirmities which taints his credibility as a star

witness.

ii. The learned trial judge has failed to judicially evaluate the

testimonial trustworthiness of PW 15 (Dhanapala) in its correct

judicial perspective.

iii. The Learned trial Judge has flawed on the principles relating

to section 27 recoveries.

iv. The basis of the conviction being eye-witness testimony,

application of the Ellenborough principle is wholly

unwarranted, inappropriate and flawed.

v. The conviction which is based on individual liability is legally

flawed.

4

The prosecution has led the evidence of 06 Witnesses and it

appears that the learned trial judge has placed much reliance on the

evidence of PW 15 Dhanapala.

The factual circumstances albeit briefly are as follows;

According to the testimony of PW 1 Kamalawathi who is the victim

in count 2, and is said to be the mistress of the deceased Somapala is

that, around 8.00-8.30 on the night of 19.06.2008, PW 15 has come to

her house with an invitation to participate in an almsgiving and the

deceased had been at her house at that time. The deceased had

accompanied PW 15 to give him some coconuts and a short time later

she has heard his cries of distress " ".When she rushed

out, a few meters from her house she had seen four people near

Somapala. Out of the four, she had identified " " (1st accused)

and Sumith (4th accused) by name and stated that although she does

not know their names she knows the other two assailants by sight who

she later identified as the 2nd and the 3rd accused.

PW 1 in her evidence responding to a question by Court has stated

that she ran shouting when she saw Somapala being assaulted,

however she was unable to catch him before he fell and from the blow

to her head she too had fallen alongside Somapala. A person who looks

like Dhanapala (PW 15) had been running away from the scene.

Thereafter, she had felt dizzy then remembers waking up in the hospital.

Her evidence is that the blow she received from the front from

" " did not affect her, but the blow from behind has affected her

and she had fallen down. She has witnessed the 1st to the 4th accused

5

having clubs in their hands. According to her there had been sufficient

light to identify the four people as the light from her son s house had

fallen on to the place of incident and also that she had run out with the

Kerosene lamp in hand. These facts were not contradicted.

According to PW 12 the investigating officer, he has made a special

note that the place of incident was visible with the moon light as the

previous day was a Poya day. In evidence he had added that not only

the moon light, but also the light from nearby buildings fell on the scene

of the crime. He has evidenced that although PW 1 could not speak and

she was in pain, she has pointed and tried to signal with her hand to a

place with blood where presumably the deceased had fallen. Therefore,

the fact that the scene of incident had sufficient light was established.

PW 4 who is the brother of the deceased on his way from work has

come upon the deceased and PW 1 lying on the road in a pool of blood.

He has reported the incident to the Police and on instructions has taken

the deceased to the hospital in a three wheeler with the help of the wife

of the deceased. They have left PW 1 injured, whining and groaning

behind, who was later dispatched to the hospital by the investigating

officer PW 12 who came to the scene around 22.29 pm at night, having

being informed by a 119 police message.

The main eye witness, PW 15 Dhanapala in his evidence has

stated that on the fateful day he went to the house of PW 1 to invite PW

1 and the deceased for his wifes 3 month almsgiving and after having

dinner with them he had left with the deceased. About 10,15 feet away

from the house of PW 1, after they went past a parked three wheeler,

6

Samantha Kiniwita (1st accused appellant) had come from behind and

held him by his shirt collar and demanded money. The deceased had

told the appellant to let go of PW 15 and that he does not have money.

Kiniwita letting go of PW 15 had taken hold of the deceased and walked

towards the house of PW 1. At that point the 3rd accused and some

others had come out of the three wheeler and joined the appellant.

Accordingly, PW 15 has identified the 1st, 3rd and the 4th accused being

there. He alleged that the 3rd accused assaulted him and when he fell

down that the 3rd accused took Rs 2300/- from his shirt pocket.

Although the counsel for the appellant submitted that PW 15 has failed

to file a complaint regarding the incident, it is noted in page 270 of the

brief that PW 12 Inspector Sumanapala has stated that the third

accused was arrested for assaulting and robbing Rs 2300/- from

Dhanapala.

PW 15 has testified that he witnessed the 1st accused assaulting

the deceased with a club ..

( page 168 of the brief) and that the deceased shouted .

He has described the club that Somapala was assaulted with and after

witnessing the assault on Somapala he had got frightened and run

away from the scene and had hidden under a bed. He has not returned

to check on Somapala as he feared for his life. The following morning he

has learnt that Somapala had died. He has evidenced that there was

sufficient light to recognize the assailants who are known people from

the village. It was alleged that due to the death threat he received from

the 1st accused he left the village and is now residing in Kalawane. He

had given a statement to the police on 21.06.2008.

7

At the trial, the Counsel for the accused have marked some

contradictions and omissions through PW 15. In pages 190 and 192 of

the brief V1 and V 2 contradictions have been marked to the effect that

in the statement to the police PW 15 has referred to a and not a

club, (that was stated in evidence) that was in the hand of the 1st

accused. However, PW 15 has sufficiently and clearly explained that

when Kiniwita came out of the three wheeler he saw him carrying what

he thought was a , but when the deceased was assaulted he

clearly saw that it was a club. This explanation can be considered as a

reasonable explanation. The learned trial judge has considered this

alleged contradiction and has arrived at a justifiable conclusion.

Contradictions 1V1 and 1V2 refer to whether PW 1 consumed

liquor with Somapala which he has denied, and are not material

contradictions.

In the case of Wickramasuriya V Dedoleena and others [1986] 2

SLR 95 his Lordship Justice Jayasuriya held that:

This is a characteristic feature of human testimony which

is full of infirmities and weaknesses especially when

proceedings are led long affer the events spoken to by

witnesses. A judge must expect such contradictions to exist

in the testimony. The issue is whether the contradictions

go to the root of the case or relate to the core of a partys

case.

8

In Attorney General V Potta Nauffer and others 2007 2 SLR 144

Thilakawardena J held that;

Therefore, court should disregard discrepancies and

contradictions, which do not, go to the root of the matter and

shake the credibility and coherence of the testimonial as a

whole. The mere presence of such contradictions therefore,

does not have the effect of militating against the overall

testimonial creditworthiness of the witness, particularly if

the said contradictions are explicable by the witness. What

is important is whether the witness is telling the truth on the

material matters concerned with the event.

The omissions cited during the trial when perused were of no

significance to the main cause of the case.

In Banda and others V Attorney General 1999 3 SLR 168 court held

that;

Omissions do not stand in the same position as

contradictions and discrepancies. Thus, the rule in regard to

consistency and inconsistency is not strictly applicable to

omissions.

In the light of the above authorities, when considering the above

mentioned contradictions and the other marked contradictions as well

as the omissions, it is apparent that they are not material or vital

contradictions and are of minor importance and do not affect the root

of the case, as correctly considered by the learned trial judge.

9

The counsel for the appellant contended that the evidence of PW

15 is plagued with infirmities which taints his credibility as a witness

and drew the attention of Court among others to the following facts; the

star witness PW 15 Dhanapala who is said to have been at the scene

has not lodged a complaint to the police; the accused were not arrested

on a police complaint; the prosecution failed to express how the names

of the accused were disclosed; PW 3 who is alleged to have disclosed the

name of the 1st accused has not given evidence; PW 15 has not given

evidence at the inquest nor at the non summary inquiry.

PW 15 being the main eye witness has clearly identified the

appellant as the person who assaulted Somapala with the club. It has

been established without any doubt that there was sufficient light at the

scene of the crime.

PW 15 has unhesitatingly admitted his failure to file a complaint

to the police on the day of the incident. But it appears he has complied

with his civic duty by informing the Police by calling 119 which has been

corroborated. His statement to the police has been on the 21st of June

about one and a half days after the incident. There is no inordinate

delay in making the statement and in fact as corroborated by PW 12,

the 3rd accused had been apprehended on the statement of PW 15. He

has testified that he being a single parent feared for his life and that his

attempt to complain to the police not being entertained made him decide

to leave the village for good. The response of the police to his request is

explained in page 176 of the brief as follows;

10

: ?

: .

.

.

It is to be noted that after PW 15 concluded his evidence at the

trial court, the learned State Counsel has informed the learned judge

about a threat to the witness and the accused appellant has been

warned by court. (page 299 of the brief). This fact justifies the evidence

of PW 15 about the threats to his life.

The Counsel for the appellant commented on the credit worthiness

of the evidence of PW 15 as he had not given evidence either at the

inquest or the non summary inquiry. It is correct that PW 15 has not

given evidence at an inquiry before he testified at the trial. However, this

fact does not disqualify him from giving evidence at the trial, as

supported by the following judicial authorities.

In Saram V Weera 1 NLR 95

In proceedings taken under chapter XVI. Of the

Criminal Procedure Code, a Police Magistrate has to take and

record evidence for the prosecution with the view of

ascertaining whether there is such a prima facie case made

out against the accused as could justify him in committing

the accused for trial to a Superior Court, and not to determine

his guilt or innocence which is in issue only in trials under

chapter XIX.

11

The King V Aron Appuhamy et al. 51 NLR 358 (Assize Court)

The Magistrate committed the accused for trial without

examining a material witness whose whereabouts could not

be traced. After the indictment was signed, but before the

trial, the missing witness was discovered. The Attorney

general gave notice both to the accused and their legal

advisers that he intended to move the Court of trial to

amend the indictment by adding the name of the new

witness. The defence was also supplied with a precis of the

evidence which the witness was expected to give.

Dias J, at page 359

The question, therefore which I must now decide is

whether in allowing this application, any substantial

injustice or prejudice will be cased to the accused. No

prejudice can possibly be caused to anybody by allowing

the truth to be made manifest. Therefore, if there is a

witness who should have been called in the Magistrates

Court but who, owing to his absence, could not be so

examined, it cannot cause injustice to the accused, provided

they have every opportunity of testing the evidence of the

witness by cross-examination on oath.

In Attorney General Vs Ranmuthudewage Susantha Dhammika

Rathnayake, CA Application No. APN 43/2015, L.T.B.Dehideniya J,

decided on 29.04.2016,

The only issue in this case is whether the trial judge can call

a person as a witness who was not called as a witness in

the non summary inquiry. The purpose of holding the non

12

summary inquiry is to ascertain whether there is a prima

facie case against the accused to commit him for trial in a

higher Court. The Magistrate is not required or empowered to

decide whether the accused is guilty or not guilty at the non

summary inquiry. His task is only to find out whether there

is enough evidence to commit the accused for trial.

As stated in the above cited authorities the holding of a non

summary inquiry is not to decide the guilt or innocence of the suspect

but only to ascertain whether there is a prima facie case made against

the accused.

In the instant case, without the evidence of Dhanapala, either at

the inquest or the non summary inquiry, the learned Magistrate has

come to a finding that there is sufficient evidence against the accused

to be committed to the High Court. Thus, it is safe to assume that no

substantial injustice or prejudice is caused to the accused by calling

PW 15 as a witness at the trial. Therefore, merely because Dhanapala

did not give evidence before the learned Magistrate, there is no necessity

to shut out the evidence before the trial judge, who must have the

benefit of hearing all the evidence to arrive at a just decision of the

case.

It is also to be considered that section 439 of the Criminal

Procedure Code provides for the summoning of any person as a witness

to arrive at a just decision.

13

Further, PW 15 was listed as a witness the prosecution intended

to call. Therefore, the appellant had due notice of that fact from the day

the indictment was served on him and as such there is no element of

surprise.

PW 15 has been named as a witness in the indictment and he is

the main eye witness. In the light of the above judicial decisions it is

abundantly clear that there was no bar for PW 15 to give evidence at

the trial not withstanding his failure to give evidence at the inquest and

the non summary inquiry.

It is also to be considered that PW 15 had witnessed the brutal

assault by the appellant on Somapala who came to his rescue when

money was demanded from PW 15. The lack luster response from the

police for his request for protection surely would have discouraged him

to be in the vicinity when there were threats to his life. He is an ordinary

security guard with a small child to look after, who had lost the wife

three months before the incident. In the circumstances, his evidence

that he left the village informing the grama sewaka is believable. He has

stated that although circumstances made him leave the village, he had

decided to come and give evidence whenever he is noticed by Court,

which he has done coming from Kalawana almost eight years after the

incident. He has given cogent and consistent evidence. The learned trial

judge after evaluating and analysing the evidence has correctly

concluded that PW 15 is a credible witness.

It is trite law that the prosecution can rely on the evidence of a

sole witness if it is cogent and impressive.

14

In the case of Wijepala V AG 2001 SLR 46 Ismail J, held that;

Senaratne who was the sole eyewitness has thus been

cross-examined on vital aspects relating to the incident and

doubts have been raised in regard to his presence at the

scene. Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance lays down a

specific rule that no particular number of witnesses shall in

any case be required for the proof of any fact, thus

attaching more importance to the quality of evidence

rather than the quantity. The evidence of a single

witness, if cogent and impressive, can be acted upon by

a Court, but whenever there are circumstances of suspicion

in the testimony of such a witness or is challenged by the

cross-examination or otherwise, then corroboration may be

necessary. ( emphasis added)

The learned counsel for the appellant contended that the accused

were not arrested on a statement by PW 15 and referred to it as an

infirmity in PW 15s evidence. It has transpired from the evidence of PW

12 that all four accused were arrested by him. The name of the first

suspect, now the appellant, has been disclosed by PW 3 who has

assisted in taking PW 1 to hospital. On the statement of PW 15, the

third accused and subsequently the other two accused have been

arrested.

PW 3 has not given evidence in court as she was abroad. Her

inability to attend courts is documented in the Journal Entry dated

21.07.2015. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that as

PW 3 was not called as a witness, the evidence of PW 12 was hearsay

evidence. However, there is no requirement in law that suspects have to

15

be arrested only on the statement of a witness. Therefore, the argument

of the counsel on that point cannot be sustained.

Another argument advanced on behalf of the appellant was that

in the instant case the conviction which is based on individual liability

is legally flawed.

King Vs Asappu 50 NLR 324 is a case in point, where it was held;

i. The case of each accused must be considered separately. ii. The accused must have been actuated by a common intention with the doer of the act at the time the offence was committed.

iii. Common intention must not be confused with same or similar intention entertained independently of each other. iv. There must be evidence, either direct or circumstantial, of pre-arrangement or some other evidence of common intention.

v. The mere fact of the presence of the accused at the time of the offence is not necessarily evidence of common intention. It is obvious from the acquittal of the 2nd to 4th accused from both

counts and the appellant from the second count that the learned trial

judge has considered the case of each of the accused separately and

acting judiciously has not imported the element of common intention

on to the other accused and found them guilty. Therefore, this court

cannot agree with the contention of the counsel for the appellant that

the learned trial judges consideration is legally flawed.

On consideration of the totality of the evidence adduced in court

it is established that the prosecution has proved the case beyond

16

reasonable doubt. The appellant has not been able to convince this

Court that there is a justifiable reason to interfere with the conclusion

of the trial judge. Accordingly, we affirm the judgement dated

25.06.2018 and the sentence imposed on the appellant. The appeal is

dismissed.

The registrar is directed to send a copy of the judgment together

with the original case record to the High Court of Kegalle.
