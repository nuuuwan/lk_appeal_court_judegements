CA No. 217/2017 H.C.AvissawellaNo. 09/2014

R. Gurusinghe, J.

The accused-appellant (Appellant) in this appeal was convicted by the

learned High Court Judge of Avissawella on 12.09.2017 for being in

possession of and trafficking 132.06 grams of heroin and was sentenced

to life imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the appellant

preferred this appeal.

The grounds of appeal are as follows:

1. The learned High Court Judge has failed to analyse the

improbabilities of the prosecution version of the case and thereby

the conviction is unsafe.

2. The learned High Court Judge has failed to analyse per se and

inter se contradictions in the evidence of the prosecution, which

creates a reasonable doubt and thereby the conviction is unsafe.

3. The Trial Judge has misdirected himself expecting an exculpatory

explanation in addition to the fairly long dock statement and

applying irrelevant legal principles to discredit the version of the

defence and thereby the conviction is unsafe.

According to the prosecution version, PW2 PC. Mahinda who was

attached to Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB) had received on 17.02.2012 at

about 16.50 an information that a woman, a mistress of Loku who was

imprisoned, living at Dikhethepma area dealing heroin and the informant

was willing to show the house of that woman. This information was

passed to PW1 by PW2.

Accordingly, PW1 Rangajeewa Inspector of Police had arranged a raid

immediately. PW1 was accompanied by PW2 PC Mahinda, PC Asela, PC

3

Vakista, PC. Susantha and PW5 WPS Samanlatha. They left the PNB at

about 17.25 and reached Dikhethepma junction at about 7.30 p.m. The

vehicle was parked near the Dikhethepma junction. They have waited for

the informant to come. At about 8.00 p.m. when the informant had

come, PC. Mahinda left with the informant at 20.10. PC Mahinda

returned alone at 21.00. When PC Mahinda and the informant went to

the accuseds house, it seemed to them that there was no one there.

Mahinda left the informant there and returned to the police vehicle and

waited for a telephone call from the informant. Mahinda received a

telephone call from the informant at 23.45. Then the police team left

Dikhethepma junction towards the house of the appellant by their

vehicle. After about 15 minutes, the vehicle was parked at a certain

place and Rangajeewa PW1, Mahinda PW2 and Samanlatha PW5 reached

the Appellants house on foot. Rangajeewa and Samanlatha were waiting

at the rear door of the house of the appellant and PC Mahinda at the

front door. On the instruction of Rangajeewa, Mahinda identifying

himself as the police called out the inmates asking them to open the

door. Then the appellant had come out from the rear door of the house

with a bag. She was stopped by PW1 and taken inside her house. PW 1

Rangajeewa had switched on the lights and opened the front door for

Mahinda to enter the house. The bag which was carried by the appellant

had six bags containing heroin. The appellant was arrested and taken

to the PNB where the substance was sealed.

The version of the accused is that the Police came to her house in the

night. She was sleeping with her children when the police had come.

They asked her to open the door and she had opened the front door.

There was no any female officer. One of the persons who entered the

house pushed the appellant and made her to sit on a chair. Thereafter

more persons entered the house from the front door and closed the door.

4

The person who pushed the appellant had shown his PNB identity card

and asked her for drugs. The appellant had then said that she had no

drugs. Then they assaulted her and searched the house and found no

illegal substance. They dragged her to the jeep and took her to the PNB.

At the PNB they had her handed over to PW5 P.S. Samanlatha.

Rangajeewa and another person had brought a parcel. There was a

substance which they had filled in bags and they had taken the thumb

impression of the appellant to that bags.

According to the appellant, there was no way to escape from her back

door as one side had a parapet wall. Other side had a barbed wire fence

and the remaining side was the house itself.

Counsel for the Appellant argues that the Trial Judge had failed to take

into account the visible improbabilities in the prosecution version.

The alleged information received by PC. Mahinda only says that the

accused is dealing with heroin, living at Dikhethepma, and the informant

could show the house she lives. There was no specific time or place as to

how the police could detect her with heroin.

According to PW1, he had received the information at 17.00 and they left

the PNB at 7.25 p.m. They have acted as soon as possible. They reached

the Dikhethepma junction at 7.30 p.m. They had been waiting at

Dikhethepma junction until 23.45 for 4.15 hours. At about midnight

only they reached the accuseds house. The officers left in such haste.

However, they spent four and quarter hours at Dikhethepma junction.

The Trial Judge has not considered the improbability that a police team

waiting for more than four hours at a junction in a vehicle. There was no

reason for them to leave the PND in such haste when considering the

alleged information.

5

It is the position of the defence that from the beginning that PW5

Samanlatha had not been a member of the police team that came to her

house.

Initial outward entry of PW1 does not contain the PW5 Samanlathas

name. After making the entry, PW1 has signed the entry. In that entry,

even the reading of the odometer was recorded. To read the odometer,

one should come to the vehicle. It is the position of the prosecution that

the PNB is at 3rd floor of that building. Once they come to the garage,

they do not go back to the PNB to make any entry regarding the vehicle.

They would include such information only after coming back to the PNB.

What was the necessity for PW1 to make another entry after signing the

earlier out entry? When this entry is confronted, answer of PW1 was, if

there was any mistake or deficiency, he would correct it and sign it

again. The position of the defence was that PW5 never came to the

accuseds house. The Trial Judge had not allowed the defence to cross-

examine on this point further stating that the Defence Counsel was

repeating the same question. Generally, the same question is not allowed

to repeat. However, this was a very important point for the defence.

There was a good reason for the defence to question on this point. The

answers given by PW1 on this point were somewhat evasive. Therefore,

the questions with regard to this point should have been allowed. The

defence was denied a fair trial by disallowing certain questions of the

defence which were very relevant to the defences case.

PW1 says Mahinda went to see the accuseds house with the informant

at 8.10 p.m. and returned to the vehicle at 9.00 p.m. Since 9.00 p.m.

until 11.45 p.m., PW1 and PW2 were inside the vehicle. When PW1 was

cross examined on whether he had asked PW2 the distance from the

vehicle to the accuseds house. PW1 said that he didnt.

6

When PW1 was cross examined on whether PC. Mahinda went with the

Informant by a vehicle or on foot, the answer of the PW1 is as follows:

At page 183 of the brief:

. H .

.

This is clearly an evasive answer. If the raid was conducted as unfolded

by the prosecution witnesses, there is no necessity for PW1 to evade any

answer. This answer is not only evasive; it lacks respect and courtesy to

the Court. The learned Trial Judge should have been mindful that

although the question was put by the Defence Counsel, all answers were

given to the Court, not to the Counsel. However, the Trial Judge in the

Judgment (page 573 of the brief) says that the prosecution witnesses

were very respectful and PW1 has given evidence in Court in a manner

which was very transparent and confident.

Judgment says thus:

.

H

.

This observation is not sound or logical when considering the evidence of

PW 1 PW 2 or PW5.

The distance from Dikhethepma junction to the house of the accused is

not a material fact, according to PW1. His position is that he did not

inquire from PW 2 the distance from the vehicle to the Appellants place

during that 3 hours. He says once they received the telephone call from

the informant, he left the Dikhethepma junction by the vehicle. It took

7

about 15 minutes to go to the place where the vehicle was stopped.

According to PW5 Samanlatha, after the vehicle was stopped at a certain

place, it had taken about 14 or 15 minutes to reach the accuseds house

by foot.

According to PW2, distance from Dikhethepma junction to the

accuseds house is about 400 or 500 meters. However, PW1 says

it took 15 minutes to go to that place by the vehicle. If it took 15

minutes as described by PW1, speed of the vehicle would be two

kilometers per an hour. The inconsistency and unacceptable

nature of this evidence was not considered by the learned Trial

Judge.

When the police called out the inmates of the house at midnight,

the accused woman was sleeping with her young children.

Immediately, she took a bag of heroin and went to the rear door

and opened it with a sound that could be heard by the police and

while she was opening the door, she was carrying the bag in her

right hand. This part of testimony is also highly improbable.

In Punkody vs AGCA 11/2005, the test of probability has been

discussed at length. Salam J considering a similar situation said,

The manner in which the raid had taken place and under the

circumstances under which the accused has been arrested red-

handed as claimed by the prosecution, while the accused lady

walking into a trap knowing very well that she was to be trapped,

demonstrate the absence of prima-facie case for an offence

particularly under section 54(D) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Act. It is common knowledge person extensively

dealing with such prohibited items for financial gain knowing very

well the consequences would never have acted in the manner the

prosecution claimed that she did act.

8

PW1 says that he had brought sealing equipment. When he was

confronted with his notes and asked that there was no such entry in this

regard, he said that it was a mistake. There were large number of

mistakes in the evidence according to the prosecution's witness. All these

mistakes were allowed in favour of the prosecution. They have not sealed

the substance at the accuseds place. PW 1,2 and 3 had given different

accounts for not sealing the substance at the Appellants house. This is

compatible with the position of the defence that the heroin was

introduced at the PNB.

Then PW1, PW2 and PW5 went to the accuseds house on foot; they had

left three male officers with weapons in the vehicle. It is difficult to

believe PW1 and PW2 with the female officer going for another 15

minutes walk in the dead of night to an unknown place, leaving behind

three male officers with weapons in the vehicle.

Contradictory evidence:

Inward entry made by PW1 at 5.00 a.m. on 22.08.2012 states that he

had employed two officers at the front door of the accuseds house while

he and PW5 went to the rear door. When he was giving evidence, he said

that only PW 2 Mahinda was kept at the front door. When he was cross-

examined drawing attention to these notes that there were two officers at

the front door; he said it was a mistake.

At page 122 of the brief PW1 says as follows:

, ... .

At page 193 and 194 on the same point, he says thus:

At this point, the Trial Judge had stopped further questioning on

the same point. Although this is not a significant contradiction, the

learned Trial Judge should have allowed the defence to ask why he

had said so in examination in chief.

When PW2 and the Informant went to the accuseds house, there

were no lights on and there was no sign that anyone was inside the

house. When the police team went there at midnight, position was

the same. According to PW2, the Informant had said that the doors

were closed and lights were off, and he believed that the relevant

woman may be sleeping inside the house. This cannot be treated

as information. The position of PW1 and PW2 was that the PW2

had left the Informant near the house of the accused to be vigilant

and inform the PW2 if she comes home; there was no such

information. It is very difficult to believe this story. The police

team had been waiting for more than four hours to receive the

above information from the Informant.

10

Unsatisfactory nature of the evidence of PW5:

PW5 says that when they have been waiting at Dikhethepma

junction; the Informant came to that place. When cross examined,

she says, she did not see the Informant.

At page 299 of the brief PW1 says:

Having answered in the above manner in evidence in chief, when

cross examined the position was that she didnt see the informant.

PW5 was cross examined about the surroundings of the accuseds

house. All those questions were answered by the PW5 either as I

did not see or I cannot recall.

11

A body search of the appellant was carried out only after she was

taken to the PNB. There was no reason to search her bodily at that

time when PW1 thought it fit not to search her bodily in her house,

when they arrested her. If PW5 Samanlatha was there at the

arrest, such a bodily search should have carried out at that time.

The evidence with regard to a body search is also contradictory.

The return note made at 5.00 a.m. on 22nd August 2012, doesnt

say that the accused was bodily searched by Samanlatha. It says

that WPS 208 Galpotta had bodily searched the accused. This

evidence is compatible with the defences position that Samanlatha

was not a member of the Police team.

PW5 could not say whether the accuseds house had windows,

whether there was a fence or wall or even a line of trees around the

accuseds compound. PW5 was not able to say how they entered

the compound of the accused. She was not able to say whether

there was a gate, whether there was a stile or anything like that.

Certain parts of her evidence are reproduced below:

She could not say at least whether the vehicle was a jeep or a van.

to that question creates a serious doubt as to the participation of

PW5 in the raid.

At this stage, the Defence suggested that she had not taken part in

this raid and that is why she cannot recall anything other than

what is there in the notes. Answering these questions, she says:

The learned High Court Judge had highly commended this answer,

and he had decided that this witness was a very reliable and

truthful witness because without seeing the son of the Appellant

she could not be emotional. There is no evidence to show how any

of them looked like. The learned High Court Judge has failed to see

that this piece of evidence is only an attempt to harmonize her

unsatisfactory evidence. The learned High Court Judge has failed

to appreciate the unreliable nature of the evidence of PW 5.

The above evidence of the PW 5 creates a reasonable doubt as to

whether PW 5 has participated in the raid. The benefit of the doubt

should have been given to the appellant.

PW1 or any other officer had not asked a single question from the

appellant to ascertain the source of the heroin. The officers not

making any attempt to reveal the source of the narcotic is

unbelievable. In Chandima vs Attorney General CA 51/2009Her

Ladyship Justice Devika Tennakoon held thus;

17

This court agrees with the submission of the learned Counsel for

the accused-appellant that the evidence does not reveal any attempt

made by the officers to ascertain the source of the Narcotics, neither

does the evidence reveal whether the accused was even questioned

as to the origin of the narcotics in question.

When considering the evidence of PW 1, PW2 and PW5 as a whole,

my view is that the evidence is highly unsatisfactory and to convict

an accused to a life sentence relying on such evidence is unsafe.

The infirmities in the case for the prosecution considered together

with the dock statement made by the appellant creates a

reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant for the charges

levelled against her as set out in the indictment for which she was

found guilty and sentenced to life.

For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that the conviction

of the accused-appellant is unsafe and cannot be allowed to stand.

Therefore, I set aside the conviction, and the sentence imposed on

the accused appellant and acquit her of the charges. Appeal is

allowed.
