Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

This application was taken up for argument together with CA (Writ) Application No.

125/2017. The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners and the learned Senior

State Counsel for the Respondents agreed that the issues that arise in both

applications are identical and that it would suffice for this Court to deliver its

judgment in this application, and that the parties in CA (Writ) Application No.

125/2013 would be bound by this judgment.

The 1st Petitioner states that in April 2014, he purchased a property bearing

assessment Nos. 47/08 and 49, St. Michel, 2nd Lane, Delthara, Piliyandala, in extent of

115.5P. The Petitioners state that the said land is depicted as Lot Nos. 1, 8, 9, 10 and

11 in Plan No. 1084 dated 28th February 1971, marked P3. It is noted that the

aggregate extent of these lots is 115.5P. The southern boundary of Lot No.1 is the

Bolgoda Lake. The Petitioners state that title to the said land can be traced upto a

deed executed in 1896.

The 2nd Petitioner is a private limited liability company, the majority shares of which

are owned by the 1st Petitioner. The Petitioners state that in February 2006, the 2nd

Petitioner purchased a property in extent of 40P bearing assessment No. 56/1,

Delthara, Piliyandala. Here too, the Petitioners state that the title to the said land can

be traced unto 1884. The western boundary of this land is the Panadura River.

4

Acting in terms of the powers vested in him by Section 24C and Section 24D of the

National Environmental Act No. 47 of 1980, as amended, the Minister of

Environment and Natural Resources had made an Order, published in Extraordinary

Gazette No. 1634/23 dated 30th December 2009 marked P11, in terms of which

inter alia:

a) The area of land, the limits of which are described in Schedule I shall be an

environmental protection area for the purposes of the aforesaid Act and shall

be called the "Bolgoda Environmental Protection Area";

b) A reservation area of at least forty (40) feet in width, from the existing high

flood level of the water body in the Environmental Protection Area should be

maintained along the banks of the lake/river.

c) No permanent or temporary construction activities shall be allowed within the

reservation area.

There is no dispute that the aforementioned lands owned by the Petitioners fall

within the "Bolgoda Environmental Protection Area". Accordingly, the Petitioners

state that they have maintained the 40 foot reservation from the existing boundary

of the Lake.

The issue that culminated with this application commenced in 2010, when a group of

environmentalists acting in the public interest filed CA (Writ) Application No.

177/2010 in this Court complaining that the Bolgoda Lake, the vegetation areas and

mangroves surrounding the Lake are being filled and reclaimed in an unauthorised

manner. The petitioners in that application had pointed out that the Bolgoda Lake

system plays a critical role inter alia in the irrigation of water and control of flooding

in the area and that due to the said unauthorised activity, the stability of the eco

system of the Bolgoda Lake and the areas surrounding the lake was severely

affected.

5

In order to support its position that there is unauthorised filling, the petitioners in CA

(Writ) Application No. 177/2010 had filed two tracings bearing Nos.

C/KSM/SUB/2001/233 and C/KSM/SUB/2001/234 prepared by the Survey

Department, which the petitioners claimed identified at least eleven persons who

had encroached onto the Bolgoda Lake. The petitioners had named as respondents

to their petition, four such persons who had engaged in such unauthorised

development. It was in that background that the petitioners had sought inter alia the

following relief in CA (Writ) Application No. 177/2010:

a) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Urban Council, Kesbewa to forthwith take

action against all unauthorised constructions in the protected area of the

Bolgoda Lake paragraph (b) of the prayer;

b) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Central Environmental Authority to forthwith

act against all unauthorised land filling in the Bolgoda Lake System paragraph

(c) of the prayer;

c) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Central Environmental Authority to act in

terms of Section 24B of the NEA Act paragraph (d) of the prayer;

d) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Divisional Secretary to recover the State

Land which had been encroached upon as a result of the said unauthorised land

filling paragraph (e) of the prayer;

e) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Urban Development Authority to institute

legal action to evict all persons who are illegally within the Bolgoda Lake

reservation area paragraph (e) of the prayer.

By its judgment delivered on 30th May 2014 marked P14, this Court issued Writs of

Mandamus on the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation, the

Central Environmental Authority and the Divisional Secretary, Kesbewa in terms of

paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of the prayer to the petition. Thus, although action had

been filed against four specific persons who were said to have encroached upon the

Bolgoda Lake and engaged in unauthorised development of the Lake, in terms of

P14, the respondents were required to take steps to prevent all unauthorised land

filling in the Bolgoda Lake Area, institute legal action to evict all persons who are

6

illegally within the Bolgoda Lake reservation area and recover the State Land which

had been encroached upon as a result of the said unauthorised land filling.

The learned Senior State Counsel submitted that in order to implement the judgment

of this Court marked P14, it was necessary for the Respondents to identify the

boundary of the Bolgoda Lake.

It was submitted further by the learned Senior State Counsel that although it was

initially decided to use the two tracings prepared in 2001 for the above purpose (i.e.

CO/KSB/SUB/2001/233 and CO/KSB/2001/234), it was discovered that those

boundary markers could not be physically identified on the land, and that a fresh

tracing had to be prepared. It was admitted by the Respondents that the Plans

prepared in 2001 are based on a Field Sheet, a fact which was not known to this

Court at the time it delivered the judgment P14.

Thus, in order to identify the boundaries of the Bolgoda Lake and implement P14,

as well as to enable the filing of action under the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act to evict those who had encroached or in other words, in order to

comply with P14, the 9th Respondent, by his letter dated 1st February 2016 marked

6R5 had sought the services of the Survey Department. In that letter, the 9th

Respondent had specifically requested the Survey Department to demarcate the

boundary of the Lake so that the 40 foot reservation declared by P11 can be

enforced.

For the purpose of demarcating the boundary of the Lake on the ground, the Survey

Department had used the aforementioned Field Sheet prepared over a hundred

years ago which depicted the boundary of the Lake as it then existed. While I would

advert later on in this judgment to the drawbacks of using the Field Sheet, it was

submitted by the learned Senior State Counsel that the Field Sheet was used as it

was the earliest documented material available with the Survey Department relating

to the boundaries of the Lake.

Using the Field Sheet, the Survey Department had produced Tracing No.

CO/KSB/2016/109 dated 23rd November 2016, marked 6R11. I have examined

6R11 and observe the following:

7

a) Demarcated in orange on the far left of 6R11, is the existing boundary line of

the lake;

b) Using the old Field Sheet Nos. L 16/15-16-23-24, the Survey Department has

demarcated the old lake boundary in black. The black line is situated on the

right of the above orange coloured line. In other words, the boundary of the

Lake as is said to have existed over a hundred years ago has shifted away from

the Lake towards the land. If this black line is applied as being the correct

boundary of the Bolgoda Lake, then, areas which are currently land would

become part of the Lake;

c) Situated on to the extreme right of the above black line is another line which is

the 40 foot restricted area gazette by the CEA. This 40 feet has been measured

from the old lake boundary marked in black and referred to in (b) above;

d) The result is that the land in between the orange line and the first black line

was identified as State land and the occupants thereof have been categorized

as encroachers.

Having prepared the relevant plans including 6R11, the Survey Department had

requested the 9th Respondent to inform the members of the Public that steps would

be taken to place on land markers to demarcate the boundary lines shown in 6R11

in black colour. In effect, what was sought to be done was to carry out a physical

demarcation of boundary lines based on the field sheet of the late 19th Century, and

thereafter demarcate the 40 foot reservation based on this line.

The Petitioners state that in early 2017, the 9th Respondent, the Divisional Secretary

of Kesbewa had distributed leaflets informing the residents that officers of the

Survey Department would be visiting their lands to erect markers of the Bolgoda

Lake boundary on their lands. It is at this stage that the residents of the area

protested to the said course of action.

Aggrieved by the decision of the 9th Respondent to demarcate the boundary based

on an old tracing, the Petitioners filed this application, seeking inter alia a Writ of

8

Prohibition prohibiting the Respondents from relying on the tracings prepared in the

late 19th century for the purpose of determining the boundaries of the lake.

At the time this matter was supported, the learned Senior State Counsel for the

Respondents had given an undertaking that the steps already taken relating to the

demarcation of the boundary of the Bolgoda Lake would not take place until the

conclusion of this application. Although not intended, the entire process of

demarcating the boundary came to a standstill, as the issue raised in this application

applied across the board. The filing of this application prompted the 1st Petitioner in

CA (Writ) Application No. 177/2010, in whose favour this Court had delivered

judgment to complain to this Court that the 1st and 9th Respondents in this

application, who were also respondents in the said application, have not complied

with the said judgment and are guilty of contempt vide CA Contempt of Court

Application No. COC/05/2018. As this application arises from the steps that the

Respondents took inter alia to implement the said judgment, the said Contempt of

Court Application was mentioned with this application and CA (Writ) Application No.

125/2013.

The issue that arises for the consideration of this Court is whether the decision of the

Respondents to have applied the Field Sheet prepared in the late 19th century in

deciding the boundaries of the Bolgoda Lake is arbitrary or unreasonable.

Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service,1

classified three grounds upon which administrative action is subject to judicial

review, namely 'illegality', 'irrationality' and 'procedural impropriety'. Having

identified the above three grounds, Lord Diplock went onto describe irrationality as

follows:

"By 'irrationality' I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as 'Wednesbury

unreasonableness.2 It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its

defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who

had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it. "

1 [1985] 1 AC 374. 2 Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1948] (1) KB 223

9

However, Courts have attempted to reduce the rigour of Wednesbury

unreasonableness over the years. The case of Secretary of State for Education and

Science v Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council,3 decided prior to the GCHQ case

provides for what can be considered a more balanced test4;

In public law, unreasonable as descriptive of the way in which a public

authority has purported to exercise a discretion vested in it by statute has

become a term of legal art. To fall within this expression it must be conduct

which no sensible authority acting with due appreciation of its responsibilities

would have decided to adopt.

Let me now consider whether the decision of the Respondents can be classified as

conduct which no sensible authority acting with due appreciation of its

responsibilities would have decided to adopt.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the Petitioners

have not encroached onto the Lake nor have they engaged in any unauthorised

development of the land. In support of this position, he submitted that the extent of

land that is being presently enjoyed by the 1st Petitioner is the same extent of land

that is shown in the Plan prepared in 1971. The learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioners submitted further that the Petitioners have made representations on

several occasions to the Officials of the Survey Department who had admitted that

the equipment that may have been used at that time may not have been

sophisticated as what is presently being used and that there can be natural changes

to the boundary of the lake over a long period of time.

The rationale for adopting the Field Sheet prepared over a century has been

explained by the learned Senior State Counsel in her written submissions. It was

submitted that the general procedure adopted by the Survey Department in

determining a boundary is to refer to old plans, either final or preliminary. However,

it was submitted that in this instance, there was neither. Available to the Survey

Consumer Affairs Authority, CA (Writ) Application No. 72/2013; CA Minutes of 26th May 2020; U.A.A.J Ukwatte and another v. Minister of Education and others, CA (Writ) Application No. 403/2019; CA Minutes of 12th June 2020.

Department however were the aforementioned Field Sheet. The Survey Department

has accordingly used the Field Sheet in the preparation of 6R11. The learned Senior

State Counsel submitted that a field sheet is a rough plan that is drawn up and used

by the surveyor when in the field, which has not formerly been converted into a Plan

and verified against the field notes. She submitted further that Field sheets contain

no boundary stones and have been prepared prior to the State Landmarks Ordinance.

Furthermore, the field sheet has not been amended to denote subsequent

surveys/plans that may have been carried out in relation to the boundary of the

Lake.

It is therefore clear that it is not entirely safe to rely on the said field sheet in order

to demarcate the present boundary of the Bolgoda Lake, nor is it reasonable to do so

where the Petitioners are able to demonstrate that the extents of land enjoyed by

their predecessors have not increased over the years. I am therefore of the view that

a Writ of Prohibition should issue preventing the Respondents from applying the

boundary of the Bolgoda Lake as it existed towards the end of the 19th century (i.e.

the first black line in 6R11) in demarcating the boundary of the Bolgoda Lake

adjoining the land owned by the Petitioners.

The learned Senior State Counsel submitted that the legal challenges to the adoption

of the boundary based on the field sheet have resulted in the Respondents facing a

greater issue. The first is the failure to continue with the steps taken to implement

the judgment of this Court in CA (Writ) Application No. 177/2010. The second is, in

the absence of a proper survey plan, the inability to prevent fresh encroachments

and reclamation of the Bolgoda Lake. She therefore submitted that immediate and

swift action is needed to be taken by the authorities to safeguard the boundary, as it

would at least ensure that the boundary of the Bolgoda Lake can be enforced on the

strength of the orange coloured line/ boundary in 6R11 prepared in 2016. In other

words, as an immediate first step, the boundary of the Bolgoda Lake, as set out by

the orange line in 6R11 should be frozen as it prevailed in 2016. This would enable

legal action to be taken in respect of any encroachments from the preparation of

6R11 in 2016. This would however not prevent the Respondents from taking legal

action where there is evidence that encroachment of the Lake has in fact taken

place.

11

The learned Senior State Counsel submitted that the process of surveying,

preparation of plans with the existing boundaries and demarcating the boundaries

on the ground has come to a standstill in view of the uncertainty arising from the

adoption and use of the Field Sheet being challenged in this application. She

submitted further that just like the Petitioners have done, other landowners may

also object to the Field Sheet being used, and that each time an objection is taken by

way of litigation, it will not be possible to cause an inquiry into the exact extent of

land that is owned or for a super imposition of the landowners survey plan to be

done on the plans of the Survey Department. It was submitted further that the

Survey Department cannot enter private land for the purpose of surveying and that

each time a landowner refuses to grant access, the process of surveying will come to

a standstill. The learned Senior State Counsel submitted that the Respondents are

keen to continue the process of demarcating the boundary of the Bolgoda Lake and

thereby continue to comply with the judgment of this Court in CA (Writ) Application

No. 177/2010. I agree with this submission of the learned Senior State Counsel and

take the view that any further delay will only frustrate the entire process and the

continued implementation of the judgment of this Court in CA (Writ) Application

177/2010.

I am of the view that adopting the boundary of the Bolgoda Lake as it prevailed in

2016 should not prevent legal action from being taken against those who have

encroached onto the Lake prior to 2016. This is a matter that can be addressed by

the 9th Respondent on a case by case basis depending on the availability inter alia of

evidence regarding reclamation and unauthorised filling of the Bolgoda Lake. In

addition, the 9th Respondent may institute legal action against those who have

encroached on to the Lake after the preparation of 6R11 in 2016, as well as

complete the demarcation of the 40 foot protected area expeditiously and without

further challenges.

In the above circumstances, I issue a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the Respondents

from relying on the said field sheet for the purpose of determining the boundaries of

the lake adjoining the Petitioners land. For the reasons that I have already adduced,

the 9th Respondent may proceed to demarcate all other lands coming under the

Divisional Secretary area of Kesbewa and falling within the Bolgoda Environmental

12

Protection Area in accordance with the boundary of the Bolgoda Lake as it prevailed

in 2016, as evidenced by the line demarcated in orange in 6R11.

I make no order with regard to costs.
