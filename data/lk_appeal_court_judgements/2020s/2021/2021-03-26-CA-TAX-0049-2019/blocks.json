The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers given to ministers are normally exercised under the authority of the ministers by responsible officials of the department. Public business could not be carried on if that were not the case. Constitutionally, the decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister. The minister is responsible. It is he who must answer before Parliament for anything that his officials have done under his authority, and, if for an important matter he selected an official of such junior standing that he could not be expected competently to perform the work, the minister would have to answer for that in Parliament. The whole system of departmental organisation and administration is based on the view that ministers, being responsible to Parliament, will see that important duties are committed to experienced officials. If they do not do that, Parliament is the place where complaint must be made against them\".[Emphasis added].",

The Carltona doctrine thus, applies where a statute has conferred a power on a Minister, and it is practically impossible for the Minister to exercise such power personally, he may, in general, act through a duly authorised officer of his department without having a formal delegation to do so. It recognises the principle that the functions of a Minister are so multifarious that the business of government could not be carried on if he were required to exercise all his powers personally. Thus, the official is treated as the ministers alter ego, and to that extent, his decision is regarded as those of the Minister.",

The traditional definition in Klaus Hofner and Fritz Elser v. Macrotron GmblH (supra) at paragraph 21 was that the concept of undertaking encompasses every entity engaged in an economic activity, regardless of the legal status of the entity and the way in which it is financed and secondly, that employment procurement is an economic activity. At paragraph 24, it was observed that an entity such as a public employment agency engaged in the business of employment may be classified as an undertaking for the purpose of applying the Community Competition rules...",
