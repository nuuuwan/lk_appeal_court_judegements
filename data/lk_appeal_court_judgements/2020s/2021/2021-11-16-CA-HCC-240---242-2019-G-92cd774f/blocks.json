He had been driving the three-wheeler that was owned by the deceased. On the way back they have stopped at the place of the incident (Aluth Paalama Handiya / Modara Watarawuma) to buy cigarettes and some food. The deceased has sat on a cement wall by the side of the road and the witness had proceeded to the boutique. Then he had seen a lorry coming from Modara side and after taking a U-turn, it has stopped. He has seen 5 to 6 persons in the lorry. They have got down from the lorry carrying manna knives. He has identified the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th accused getting down from the vehicle with the knives. He said he knew the lorry before as owned by the 5th accused. He has seen the 1st accused also coming towards the scene. He knew all the accused persons before, other than the 1st accused. He again said that other than the driver (7th accused) the other accused carried manna knives and later he said he saw the 7th accused also carried a kris-knife. The 4th and 7th accused have shouted , and all other accused have assaulted the deceased with their knives. When he saw the accused getting down from the lorry he has turned and looked at the scene. He had taken cover behind a wall, where there is a small bench, while watching the accused persons cutting the deceased. Then the accused persons have started chasing him where he ran to a nearby temple and informed the priest. After calling the police he had come back to the crime scene and the deceased was taken to the hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.",
