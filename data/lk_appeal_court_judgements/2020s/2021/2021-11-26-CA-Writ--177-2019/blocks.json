Both parties agreed to get the argument disposed by way of written submissions. Anyhow none of the parties have filed the written submissions. There are several connected matters that were taken up together with this matter. The court observers that the facts relating to each are different. While the Petitioner was serving as an employee at the Prima Ceylon Ltd, he had been granted a tenancy in respect of the premises at B-29 in Daanyagama Housing Scheme, China Bay, Trincomalee upon the Lease Agreement P2 entered into between the Petitioner and the Food Commissioner. The Petitioner states that he has complied with all terms and conditions of the said agreement. Later on, the Respondent had taken steps to recover the possession of the said house and accordingly, proceedings had been instituted before the Magistrates Court of Trincomalee against the Petitioner in order to recover the possession of the house in issue in terms of the Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act. Nevertheless, the said action has been later withdrawn by the Food Commissioner. Thereafter, the Respondent has issued the purported quit notice dated 18.02.2019 (P3) against the Petitioner demanding him to hand over the vacant possession of the said premises alleging that the Petitioner has acted in breach of the Lease Agreement. In spite of such circumstances, the Petitioner has made this application moving to this Court moving for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the quit notice marked P3 stating that the purported quit notice is bad in law for the reasons mentioned below.",
