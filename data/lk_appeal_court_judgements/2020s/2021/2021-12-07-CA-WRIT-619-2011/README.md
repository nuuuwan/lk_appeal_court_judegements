JUDGMENT

The Petitioner seeks orders Writ of Certiorari against the 1st and the 2nd Respondents regarding

orders or decisions taken by the 1st Respondent. As the 2nd Respondent is functioning under

the 1st Respondent, the Writ of Certiorari applied for by the Petitioner should bind him. His

plea was to quash the orders made by the 1st Respondent in requesting to find another place to

run the liquor shop by document marked as [P11]. To quash the order of temporally

suspending the liquor license described by the document marked as [P7a].

Page 4 of 7

A Writ of Mandamus against the 5th Respondent to extend the validity of the license issued to

him in terms of Gazette No.1544/17 dated 10th April 2008. Subject to these two main Writs,

he had sought interim reliefs from this Court. Spelling out his grievance, the Petitioner had

stated that in 2006, he the Petitioner was issued with a license to run a liquor shop as a retail

liquor business at Main Street, Anguruwella, Kegalle.

By document marked [P3a], Petitioner had forwarded an application to transfer the Liquor

license issued to him to No. 83/07, Wawulgas Handiya, Kandy Road, Uhana. After the

formalities, the 1st Respondent, being satisfied, issued an FL 4 license to the Petitioner for one

month. The document giving permission was marked as [P4]. When perusing the document

marked [P4] at the letter's conclusion, a paragraph had been added depicting that the license

had not been in operation after 31st December 2006. On payment, the Petitioner received the

permits marked as [P6a] and [P6b]. Even though the Petitioner had a permit to run the shop

till 2nd March 2011, on 21st February 2011, he received an order to suspend the license subject

to an inquiry.

After inquiry the 4th Respondent on 05.04.2011, the Petitioner was informed by letter dated

24.05.2011 as there were protests against the liquor shop by members of the clergy and the

general public to find alternative premises to carry on the business. It is the contention of the

Petitioner at the outset; he had satisfied all requirements specified in the Excise Ordinance and

the Gazette notification marked as [P1]. When he was issued an FL 4 liquor license, an inquiry

was held to satisfy the authorities of the compliance of statutory requirements.

Therefore, cancelling the permit issued to the Petitioner becomes unlawful and an arbitrary

decision of the Respondents. On these grounds, the Petitioner seeks the intervention of this

Court. The 1st to 5th Respondents filed their objections. Later the Petitioners amended the

Petition and introduced the 6th to 8th Respondents. On this ground, the objections were also

amended. The matter was argued on the amended Petition and the amended objections.

Two places were rejected when the Petitioner sought the license to be transferred from Kegalle

to Ampara due to public protest. That was the reason on the third occasion 2nd Respondent

had recommended a trial period of one month. Considering that the Petitioner's application

on two previous occasions had to be turned down due to public protest and on the

recommendation of the 2nd Respondent, the 1st Respondent informed the 5th Respondent that

the re-location was allowed for one month. That was why the 5th Respondent had issued an

excise license-produced as [P6a] and [P6b]. Due to the public demonstrations and unrest, the

1st Respondent had to inform the 5th Respondent to suspend the license issued temporally. The

1st Respondent appointed the 4th Respondent to inquire into the public unrest. After inquiry,

the 4th Respondent communicated to the 1st Respondent that a license should not be issued to

the premises and the Petitioner should relocate his business due to public unrest.

The power is given by document marked [P1], which is the government Gazette to inquire

into the public unrest and if it is found objections of the general public may threaten law and

order in the area to advice to relocate the business. Under the power given to the 1st

Respondent, he had ordered the Petitioner to relocate to maintain peace and public harmony.

The Respondents contended that the Petition should fail since the Respondents have acted

according to law. The Petitioner argued regarding paragraph 21 of the document marked [P1].

The Respondents contended that the order to relocate was done, considering the public protest

and according to powers given by this paragraph. Even though the Petitioner believes that

paragraph 21 speaks of a situation where the requirements are violated, the Court can not

accept it.

In perusing the paragraph, it is true at the beginning it speaks of grounds of violation or non-

compliance it also speaks ". In such an inquiry, if it is found that the establishment

containing the license at that place may threat or likely threat to the maintenance of law and

order in the area, Commissioner General of Excise can decide to relocate the licensed premises

to a suitable place. The decision will be final." On the strength of this averment, the

Respondents had acted according to the law. I consider that this is the third place, and on two

Page 6 of 7

other occasions, the Petitioner had to relocate due to public protest. Since every place has to

be treated as new premises and the formalities should be followed, one cannot argue

harassment or difficulties. Even it is the hundredth time; every place should be considered

afresh.

As for the expenses incurred by the Petitioner in applying for a liquor license, the Applicant

agrees to satisfy all aspects stipulated by document marked [P1], which speaks of public unrest

as one of the aspects. Petitioner's argument in this respect will have to be set aside as the

gazette had spoken of public unrest and protest. It is well within the powers that the 1st

Respondent had considered public harmony as a supreme ingredient that the Petitioner should

fulfil.

Another point which the Petitioner argued was regarding the expenditure borne by him.

Renting premises is his duty. Without a place to run the business, he cannot in any way make

the application for a liquor license. It has nothing to do with the Respondent. The only part

that will show any involvement of the Respondent is collecting license fees for previous years.

Paragraph 22 of [P1] speaks thus;

"Application for license in respect of premises wherein a license has already been in

operation, will be considered only on condition that all dues in respect of the license

in operation or operated previously in such premises or in the applicant's name have

been fully paid and settled."

Considering this provision, the Petitioner holds no right to argue regarding expenses incurred

or monies paid by him in respect of license fees. Considering prayer [c] of the amended

Petition to issue a Writ of Mandamus to extend the validity of FL 4 liquor license first, this

Court should be satisfied that the Petitioner had fulfilled all ingredients for such a Writ to be

granted.

Page 7 of 7

The Petitioner must bring to the notice of this Court an express or implied refusal to exercise

power vested on the Respondents by law. The Respondent had acted under the powers

provided in [P1] to keep public harmony. Therefore, the main ingredient of Mandamus fails.

When the authorities had acted within their power to safeguard public harmony, can the

Petitioner complain. Arguments of the Petitioner failed to provide of a refusal to grant the

license. Therefore, the prayer in respect of a Writ of Mandamus fails.

Another prayer of the Petitioner was for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st,

2nd and the 5th Respondents cancelling with immediate effect the FL 4 license issued to the

Petitioner's place of business at No. 83/07, Wawulgas Handiya, Kandy Road, Uhana.

To exercise power given to this Court to issue a Writ of Certiorari, the Petitioner will have to

prove that the Respondents have acted with an error of law. The Petitioner must satisfy this

Court the ultra vires act of the Respondent. Petitioner fails to establish any reason for the

Respondents to act other than to safeguard the public against protests. In reality, the

Respondents have acted to maintain peace and harmony within the community. That too under

the powers vested.

This Court sees no reason to issue an order as prayed for by the Petitioner. Since the Petitioner

is not entitled to the prayers, his interim prayers too cannot be considered. For reasons set out

above, I dismiss the application of the Petitioner.
