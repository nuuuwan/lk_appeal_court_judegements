MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the 9th Defendant-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the 9th Defendant) from the judgment of

the learned District Judge of Kandy dated 14.07.1998.

The facts, briefly, in this case are as follows. The Plaintiff-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) instituted

action to partition four lands, namely (1) Kiriwane Kumbura & Thale

Kumbura, (2) Nuwara Pakshapedi Gedera Watta, (3) Thoradeniya

Watta and (4) Ketawalahena, that have respectively been described

in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th schedules to the amended plaint dated

02.03.1998, amongst the co-owners as set out in paragraph 9 of the

same.

After trial, the learned District Judge of Kandy pronounced the

impugned judgment dated 14.07.1998 in order to partition the lands

described in 1st, 2nd and 3rd schedules, among the co-owners as set

out in the judgment.

Being aggrieved by the judgment, the 9th Defendant has preferred

the instant appeal.

Corpus:

There is no dispute as to the identification of the subject matter

sought to be partitioned. Admittedly, the corpus in this case is

described as follows:

1. The land more fully described in the 1st schedule to the

amended plaint, namely Kiriwane Kumbura and Thale

Kumbura is depicted in the preliminary plan bearing No. 2309

dated 03.03.1981 made by A.B. Kiridena, Licensed Surveyor

marked P1.

Page 4 of 9

2. The land more fully described in the 2nd schedule to the

amended plaint, namely Nuwara Pakshapedi Gedera Watta is

depicted in the preliminary plan bearing No. 2311 dated

03.03.1981 made by A.B. Kiridena, Licensed Surveyor marked

P3.

3. The land more fully described in the 3rd schedule to the

amended plaint, namely Thoradeniya Watta is depicted in the

preliminary plan bearing No. 2312 dated 03.03.1981 made by

A.B. Kiridena, Licensed Surveyor marked P5.

4. The land more fully described in the 4th schedule to the

amended plaint, namely Ketawalahena is depicted in the

preliminary plan bearing No. 87/51 dated 28.05.1987 made

by A.B. Kiridena, Licensed Surveyor marked P7. (Vide,

admissions, 1, 2, 3 and 4. See, page 74 of the Appeal brief)

However, the learned District Judge, in the impugned judgment

dated 14.07.1998, has confined the corpus sought to be partitioned

to the lands described in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd schedules of the

amended plaint, and excluded the land shown in the 4th schedule

(vide judgment at page 129 of the Appeal brief). It is to be noted that

there is no appeal preferred against the aforesaid findings of the

learned trial Judge.

Devolution of title:

Section 25 of the Partition Law, No. 22 of 1871 (as amended) imposes

on the court the obligation to investigate title of each party carefully.

In Juliana Hamine v. Don Thomas [1957] 59 NLR 546, it was held

that,

Section 25 of the Act makes it obligatory on the Court to

scrutinize, quite independently of what the parties may or may

Page 5 of 9

not do, the title of each party before any share is allotted to him.

Where a party fails to produce his material documents of title,

or omits to prove his title, the procedure prescribed in sections

20 and 61 of the Act should be followed.

In the case of Magilin Perera v. Abraham Perera [1986] 2 Sri LR

208, the Court of Appeal observed that,

When a partition action is instituted the plaintiff must perforce

indicate an original owner or owners of the land. A plaintiff

having to commence at some point, such owner or owners need

not; necessarily be the very first owner or owners and, even if

it be so claimed, such clam need not necessarily and in every

instance be correct because when such an original owner is

shown it would theoretically and actually be possible to go back

to still an earlier owner. Therefore, in actual practice it is the

usual, and in my view sensible, attitude of the Courts that it

would not be reasonable to expect proof within very high

degrees of probability on questions such as those relating to the

original ownership of land. Courts by and large countenance

infirmities in this regard, if infirmities they be, in an approach

which is realistic rather than legalistic as to do otherwise would

be to put relief given by partition decrees outside the reach of

very many persons seeking to end their co-ownership

In Thilagaratnam v. Athpunadan and Others [1996] 2 Sri LR 66,

it was decided that,

Although there is a duty cast on court to investigate title in a

Partition action, the court can do so only within the limits of

pleadings, admissions, points of contest, evidence both

documentary and oral.

Per Anandacoomaraswamy, J.

"Court cannot go on a voyage of discovery tracing the title and

finding the shares in the corpus for them; otherwise parties will

tender their pleadings and expect the court to do their work and

their Attorneys-at Law's work for them to get title to those

shares in the corpus."

In the instant case, as per the pedigree set out in the plaint, by virtue

of the final decree of the Partition action bearing No. 21524 marked

P10 (Partition action in the District Court of Kandy), Kiribandu and

Rankiri became the original owners of the land described in the 1st

and 2nd schedules to the amended plaint. The said Kiribandu by

deed No. 283 dated 14.07.1933 marked P12 conveyed his rights to

the aforesaid Rankiri who transferred the same to Somawathi by

deed No. 23590 dated 05.08.1927 marked P13 and deed No. 10847

dated 13.02.1947 marked P14.

By virtue of the deed bearing No. 11325 dated 23.12.1908 marked

P9, the said Rankiri became the original owner of the land more fully

described in the 3rd schedule to the amended plaint who conveyed

that right to the aforesaid Somawathi by P14.

By virtue of the final decree of the Partition action bearing No. 3318

in the District Court of Kandy marked P15, the said Somawathi

became the original owner of the land described in the 4th schedule

to the amended plaint. Accordingly, the said Somawathi became the

owner of the entire corpus sought to be partitioned.

Admittedly, on the demise of the said Somawathi, her rights devolved

on her children, namely the Plaintiff and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Defendant-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the respective

Defendants).

Page 7 of 9

It was the contention of the Plaintiff that the 1st and 2nd Defendants

are not entitled to succeed the right of the said Somawathi on the

basis that they had Deega marriage before the death of Somawathi.

Hence, the Plaintiff is entitled to an undivided 1/2 share and the 3rd

defendant is entitled to an undivided 1/2 of the subject matter.

The finding of the learned trial Judge was that, in terms of the

Kandyan Law, the daughters who contracted Deega marriage before

the death of their father are not entitled to succeed fathers rights.

But this position does not apply to the properties of mother. In short,

according to the Kandyan Law, the daughters who contracted Deega

marriage before the death of their mother are also entitled to succeed

mothers inheritance rights. Accordingly, the learned trial Judge

held that Somawathis rights should devolve on the Plaintiff and 1st,

2nd and 3rd Defendants as follows:

Plaintiff : 1/4

1st Defendant : 1/4

2nd Defendant : 1/4

3rd Defendant : 1/4

It is pertinent to be noted that the Plaintiff has opted not to appeal

against the foregoing determination of the learned trial Judge.

Having scrutinized the pedigree set out in the judgment, it appears

to this Court that the learned trial Judge has properly investigated

the title of the parties in terms of the Partition Law.

I shall now deal with the grounds of appeal advanced by the 9th

Defendant who has preferred the instant appeal.

The contention of the 9th Defendant was that the said Rankiri died

leaving a last Will. The said last Will was proved in a Testamentary

action bearing No. T/1130. According to the last Will, the 9th

Defendant became the owner of the entire rights of said Rankiri in

Page 8 of 9

respect of the lands described in the 1st and 2nd schedules.

Moreover, by virtue of the Deed bearing No. 9354 dated 03.11.1960,

one Siriya who was the father of the 9th Defendant became the owner

of the lands described in schedule 3 and 4. On the demise of said

Siriya, the 9th Defendant became entitle to the said rights by virtue

of the Testamentary action bearing No. 2926 in the District Court of

Kandy.

The learned District Judge has rightly observed the fact that the 9th

Defendant cannot obtain title from said Rankiri to the lands

described in the 1st and 2nd schedule, since Rankiri has already

conveyed his entire rights to Somawathi by deeds marked P13 and

P14. Further, it is pertinent to be noted that the said deeds marked

P13 and P14 have not been disputed by the 9th Defendant.

Furthermore, since the said Rankiri had obtained title to the land

described in the 3rd schedule by P9 in 1908, the 9th Defendants

father, Siriya cannot obtain title by deed bearing No. 9354 in 1960.

Having considered the evidence adduced, it is manifestly clear that

the 9th Defendant totally failed to establish the purported pedigree

set out in his statements of claim.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 9th Defendant also

contended that several lands cannot be partitioned in one action

such as in the instant case. I decline to accept this contention.

It is settled law that the co-owners are entitled to have common

lands partitioned in a partition action, provided that there should be

a common pedigree pertaining to the lands sought to be partitioned.

As correctly held by Garvin S.P.J. (Macdonell C.J. concurring) in

Eliyatambi v. Kanapathy Veeragathie [1934] 35 NLR 211, at p.

213, it is not contemplated by the provisions of the Partition

Ordinance that any more than one land will be partitioned in one

Page 9 of 9

proceeding (Also see, Richard and Another v. Seibel Nona and

Others [2001] 2 Sri LR 1, at p. 8).

Conclusion:

In these respects, I see no basis to interfere with the judgment of the

learned District Judge of Kandy dated 14.07.1998. Accordingly, I

affirm the judgment of the District Judge and dismiss the appeal

with costs fixed at Rs. 30,000/-.

The Registrar is directed to dispatch a copy of this judgment along

with the original case record to the District Court of Kandy.

Appeal dismissed.
