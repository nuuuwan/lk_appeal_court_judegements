of the 2nd Respondent, in granting approval to transfer part of

the said paddy field by the 4th Respondent to the 3rd Respondent

by letter dated 01.10.2012 bearing reference No.

NCP/TK/9/4/164/19 as evidenced by P9.

c) A mandate in the nature of writ of mandamus to compel the 1st

and 2nd Respondents to issue and/or transfer the rights under

the grant Pol/G/4063 (P15A) in respect of the paddy field

bearing Lot No. 124 depicted in FCP Plan No. 33 in the name of

the Petitioner.

When this matter was taken up for argument, both parties had

consented to dispose the matter by way of written submissions.

I have been nominated by His Lordship Justice Arjuna Obesekera,

President of the Court of Appeal (as he then was) to hear and determine

this case, sitting alone.

The Contention of the Petitioner

The 1st Respondent is the Commissioner General of Lands assigned

with the powers for due performance of duties and function and the

general supervision and control of all Government Agents and officers

in respect of State Lands in terms of section 3 of the Land Development

Ordinance. The 2nd Respondent is the Divisional Secretary of

Thamankaduwa, Polonnaruwa who exercises powers and duties under

the Land Development Ordinance subject to the supervision of the 1st

Respondent.

The paddy field described as Lot No. 124 in FCP Plan No. 33, an extent

of 4A-1R-10P is the subject matter in this case. On 28.01.1983, in

terms of the Provisions of the Land Development Ordinance No. 19 of

1935 (as amended), one K.M. Kira obtained a Grant bearing No.

Page 4 of 9

P/G/4063 in respect of the said paddy field, from the state (P5A). The

said Kira married to one Dingiri and they had children as follows:

1. K.M. Laisa, born in 1928 (Daughter).

2. K.M. Martin, born in 1930 (Eldest son- Petitioners father).

3. K.M.D. Wimalaweera, born in 1933 (2nd son- 4th Respondent).

4. K.M. Rosalin, born in 1936 (Daughter).

The Petitioner states that the said Dingiri died in 1938, and thereafter,

the said Kira was living with one Punchi Ridi. The contention of the

Petitioner was that there was no lawful marriage between Kira and

Punchi Ridi. The said Punchi Ridi gave birth to following children:

1. Bastian, born in 1941.

2. Simon, born in 1944.

3. Piyasena, born in 1950 (3rd Respondent).

4. Jinadasa, born in 1953.

5. David, born in 1955.

6. Emalin, born in 1956.

On 19.10.1961, the said K.M. Martin, the eldest son of Kira married

one Devagiri Henayalage Emalin and the only child born on 08.09.1962

from the said marriage was the Petitioner in this case.

It was contended by the Petitioner that the said Kira died on

23.05.1992, and thereupon, the said K.M. Martin being the eldest son

of Kira succeeded to the subject matter in operation of law. The said

Martin died on 23.11.1993 before a deed of transfer executed in his

name by the state. Subsequently, on 11.12.1994, the said Punchi Ride,

the partner of the said Kira died.

The Petitioner states that in terms of the provisions of the Land

Development Ordinance, she is entitled to the subject matter upon the

demise of her father, namely the said K.M. Martin.

Page 5 of 9

The Petitioner further states that the 4th Respondent has secretly and

fraudulently made representation to the 2nd Respondent that he is the

eldest son of the original grantee, and therefore the 4th Respondent is

entitled to succeed to the subject matter. Accordingly, the 2nd

Respondent without holding an inquiry had transferred the subject

matter to the 4th Respondent by letter dated 16.08.2001. The said letter

is marked as X13 and the Register of Permits/Grants is marked as P9).

Thereafter, the 4th Respondent by an undated deed bearing No. 28

attested by M.S. Gajanayake, Notary Public marked X7, sold part of

the subject matter, an extent of 2A-3R-10P to the 3rd Respondent. The

1st Respondent has granted approval for the said transfer by letter

dated 01.10.2012 under reference No. NCP/TK/9/4/164/19 (Vide P9

page No.2).

The Petitioner further states that even though the 1st and 2nd

Respondents held several inquiries upon the complaints made by the

Petitioner in this regard, no final decision was made to transfer the

subject matter in the name of the petitioner.

Accordingly, the Petitioner states that she has a legitimate expectation

to receive a transfer of rights in respect of the subject matter in terms

of the Land Development Ordinance, and the aforesaid transfers in the

names of the 4th and 3rd Respondents are fraudulent, illegal and void

ab initio on the basis that:

a) The 2nd Respondent could not have transferred or grant approval

for a transfer the said subject matter in the name of the 4th Respondent in terms of the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance where only the Petitioners father K.M. Martin is legally entitled to succeed upon the death of the original grantee. Upon the death of the said Martin, the Petitioner being the only daughter is lawfully entitled to succeed. b) The 2nd Respondent in transferring the said subject matter

without an inquiry had acted in violation of the rules of natural justice and the express provisions of the Land Development Ordinance.

Page 6 of 9

In the circumstances, the Petitioner contended that, the aforesaid

orders or approvals to transfer the subject matter to the 4th and 3rd

Respondents are illegal and liable to be quashed by way of writ of

certiorari. The 1st and 2nd Respondents are entrusted with the public

duty to effect the transfer of the subject matter in the name of the

petitioner and had failed to exercise the power vested in them and

therefore the petitioner is entitled to compel to perform their duties by

way of writ of mandamus.

The Contention of the Respondents

The Respondents are not disputing the pedigree of the said Kira which

is set out in the Petition. However, in a nutshell, the Respondents took

up the position that the marriage between Kira and Punchi Ridi was a

valid marriage by cohabitation and repute. Thus, on the demise of Kira

the surviving spouse, Punchi Ridi succeeded to the subject matter. On

the demise of the said Punchi Ridi, the second son of Kira, the 4th

Respondent is entitled to succeed as the eldest son, Martin died before

the demise of Punchi Ridi. In the circumstances, the transfer of the

subject matter to the 4th Respondent by P9 and the subsequent deed

of transfer executed in favour of the 3rd Respondent are lawful and valid

in terms of the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance.

The fact in issue

The central issue to be considered in this case is as to whether there

was a valid marriage between Kira and Punchi Ridi by cohabitation

and repute, that fact has to be established by the respondents with

strong and cogent evidence.

The attention of this Cout is drawn to the Birth Certificate of David (P1)

who is the son of Punchi Ridi wherein the particulars of his father are

not stated. It is well established by P1 that Punchi Ridi was not married

to Kira as well. The 3rd and 4th Respondents along with their Statement

of Objections have submitted the Birth Certificates of 3rd Respondent

Page 7 of 9

and Emalin who are the children of Punchi Ridi marked X2 and X1

respectively. It is pertinent to be noted that in X1 and X2, K.M. Kira

has not been indicated as the father of the 3rd Respondent and Emalin.

Moreover, it appears to this Court that there is no evidence adduced by

the Respondents to substantiate the purported fact that there was a

valid marriage between Kira and Punchi Ridi by cohabitation and

repute.

I agree with the decisions of Apex Courts cited by the learned Senior

Deputy Solicitor General in the written submissions filed on behalf of

the 1st and 2nd Respondents stating that the marriage by cohabitation

and repute should be considered when dealing with the question of

succession under the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance.

However, in the instant case, the claim of marriage by cohabitation and

repute between Kira and Punchi Ridi has not been established to the

satisfaction of this Court. Vide Sarathchandra vs. Attorney General3.

In the circumstances, I am of the considered view that the position took

up by the Respondents in their Statement of Objection is devoid of

merits.

Having scrutinised the documents and the affidavits tendered by the

parties it is abundantly clear that the 1st and 2nd Respondents failed to

hold a fair and reasonable inquiry in terms of the provisions of the Land

Development Ordinance to determine the successor of the original

grantee, Kira.

Under section 72 of the Land Development Ordinance, the eldest son

of the Permit/Grant holder is the lawful successor in the absence of a

nomination of a successor and/ or the spouse of the Permit/Grant

holder is demised, which reads thus:

If no successor has been nominated, or if the nominated successor fails to succeed, or if the nomination of a successor contravenes the provisions of this Ordinance, the title to the land

Page 8 of 9

alienated on a permit to a permit-holder who at the time of his or her death was paying an annual instalment by virtue of the provisions of [44, 16 of 1969] [45, 16 of 1969] [46, 16 of 1969] [47, 16 of 1969] [47, 16 of 1969] section 19 or to the holding of an owner shall, upon the death of such permit-holder or owner without leaving behind his or her spouse, or, where such permit-holder or owner died leaving behind his or her spouse, upon the failure of such spouse to succeed to that land or holding, or upon the death of such spouse, devolve as prescribed in rule 1 of the Third Schedule.

THIRD SCHEDULE

RULES

1(a). The groups of relatives from which a successor may be nominated for the purposes of section 51 shall be as set out in the subjoined table.

(b) Title to a holding for the purposes of section 72 shall devolve on one only of the relatives of the permit-holder or owner in the order of priority in which they are respectively mentioned in the subjoined table, the older being preferred to the younger where there are more relatives than one in any group. [Sections 51, 71,72 and 77.]

Table:

(i) Sons. (vii) Brothers. (ii) Daughters, (iii) Grandsons, (iv) Granddaughters, (v) Father, (vi) Mother, (vii) Brothers, (viii) Sisters, (ix) Uncles, (x) Aunts, (xi) Nephews, (xii) Nieces.

In the case in hand, K.M. Martin, father of the Petitioner was the eldest

son of the Grantee, Kira, and therefore, in terms of section 72 of the

Land Development Ordinance, he was the lawful successor of Kira.

In the circumstances, it is abundantly clear that the decision of the 2nd

respondent dated 16.08.2001, transferring the subject matter to the

4th Respondent and the decision in granting approval to transfer part

of the subject matter by the 4th Respondent to the 3rd Respondent are

illegal and contrary to the provisions of the Land Development

Ordinance.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court issue the following relief:

1. A writ of certiorari as prayed for in Paragraph (ii) of the petition

dated 30.06.2014, to quash the decision of the 2nd

Respondent dated 16.08.2001 bearing reference No.

NCP/TK/9/5/Mul/Pol/G/4063/, in transferring the paddy

field bearing Lot No. 124 depicted in FCP plan No. 33 and

referred to in Grant No. 4063, to the 4th Respondent.

2. A writ of certiorari as prayed for in paragraph (iii) of the

prayers to the petition dated 30.06.2014, to quash the

decision of the 2nd Respondent, in granting approval to

transfer part of the said paddy field by the 4th respondent to

the 3rd Respondent by letter dated 01.10.2012 bearing

reference No. NCP/TK/9/4/164/19.

3. A writ of mandamus as prayed for in paragraph (iv) of the

prayers to the petition dated 30.06.2014, to compel the 1st

and 2nd Respondents to issue and/or transfer the rights

under the grant Pol/G/4063 in respect of the paddy field

bearing Lot No. 124 depicted in FCP Plan No. 33 in the name

of the Petitioner.

Considering the circumstances of this case, I make no order for costs.

Application of the Petitioner is allowed.
