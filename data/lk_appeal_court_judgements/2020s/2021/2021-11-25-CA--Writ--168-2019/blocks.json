Both parties agreed to conclude the case by way of written submissions. Anyhow none of the parties have filed the written submissions. There are several connected matters that were taken up together with this matter. The court observers that the facts relating to each are different. While the Petitioner was an employee of the Prima Ceylon Ltd, he had been granted a tenancy in respect of the premises at C-26 in Daanyagama Housing Scheme, China Bay, Trincomalee upon the Lease Agreement P2 entered into between the Petitioner and the Food Commissioner. The Petitioner states that though he has complied with all terms and conditions of the said agreement P2, there had been several attempts on the part of the Food Commissioner to recover possession of the premises in issue. Later on, the Petitioner has been served with a quit notice in term of the Government Quarters a requiring him to vacate the premises since the Petitioner has acted in breach of the terms of the said Lease Agreement. In spite of such circumstances, the Petitioner has lodged this Petition before this Court moving for a Writ of Certiorari quashing the quit notice marked P4 stating that the purported quit notice is bad in law for the reasons mentioned below.",
