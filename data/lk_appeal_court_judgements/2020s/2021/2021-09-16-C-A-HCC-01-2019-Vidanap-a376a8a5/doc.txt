K. Priyantha Fernando, J. (P/CA)

1. The accused appellant was indicted in the High Court of Colombo for

trafficking and having in possession of 2.78 grams of Heroin in terms of Sections 54A(b) and 54A(d) of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance respectively. Upon conviction on both counts after trial, the learned High Court Judge sentenced the appellant for life imprisonment for both counts. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the appellant has preferred the instant appeal on the following grounds;

1) The learned Trial Judge had failed to consider the improbability

of the prosecution story 2) The learned Trial Judge had unreasonably refused the defence

evidence. 3) The learned Trial Judge has shifted the burden of proof on the

defence.

2. At the hearing of the appeal, the learned counsel for the appellant mainly

relied on the 2nd and 3rd grounds of appeal. All three grounds of appeal will be discussed together. 3. Brief facts as elicited from the evidence for the prosecution are that on

26th May 2015, when witness Mahendra Ranasingha (PW1) was the Officer in Charge of the Western Province Vice Squad, at about 15.55 had received an information that one Jayanthi from Sinna Dupatha will be carrying heroin. Accordingly, he had organized the raid. He also had

3

got all the officers in the team searched and got satisfied that none of them had any illegal substance with them. He also had searched the white van that they were to travel and had left the station at 16.00 hrs. PW1 had got down from the van with some officers and rest of the officers were asked to be at a different place with the van.

4. Upon receiving the information over the telephone from his informant,

PW1 had stopped the appellant who was walking towards him. The woman police officer had searched the appellant. They have found a cellophane bag that contained heroin inside the right-hand side pocket of the frock the appellant was wearing.

5. When the defence was called after the case for the prosecution was

closed, the appellant had given sworn evidence and also had called two witnesses to substantiate her position. The appellants evidence was that she was running a small boutique close to her house. When she was in the shop, she had wanted money to pay a bill for biscuits and had gone to aunty Kusumas house to lend Rs.3000/-. Kusuma did not have the money to give her. When she was coming back, she was searched by the police and nothing was found, she had testified. She had been taken to Kusumas house. She had been searched again and then also Kusuma was searched. She was then taken back to her house. As the key to the house was with the daughter who was in the shop, she was then taken to the shop to get the key. Then her house also was searched, but nothing was found, she had said. She had then been taken to the police. The appellant had also called the said Kusuma and her daughter to give evidence on her behalf to substantiate her position.

6. It is the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that it was

highly unreasonable to reject the evidence of the appellant, Kusuma and the appellants daughter and their evidence was consistent and no contradictions were shown between their evidence. It is also submitted that the learned High Court Judge has failed to give due consideration to the evidence adduced by the defence.

7. It is the contention of the learned DSG for the respondent that the defence

is riddled with inconsistencies. It is submitted that according to the

4

appellant, she was arrested on her return from Kusumas residence and however, the daughters evidence was that her mother took about 45 minutes to return from Kusumas house to the shop.

8. In James Silva V. The Republic of Sri Lanka [1980] 2 Sri L.R. 167 at P

176 following the Privy Council case of Jayasena V. The Queen 72 NLR 313it was stated;

A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by the defence in its totality without compartmentalizing and, ask himself whether as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty.

Indian Supreme Court in case of D.N.Pandey V. State of Uttarapradesh AIR 1981SC 911 held thus;

Defence witnesses are entitled to equal treatment with those of the prosecution and, Court ought to overcome their traditional instinctive disbelief in defence witnesses. Quite often they tell lies but so do the prosecution witnesses.

9. The learned High Court Judge in his judgment at page 43 (page 455 of

the brief) has said that there is a confusion as to why the appellant was taken to Kusumas house if she was arrested at her house. The appellant has given clear evidence without any confusion as to the sequence of events that took place that led to her arrest. Appellants evidence is well substantiated by the evidence of Kusuma and the daughter. Position of the defence right throughout had been that the appellant who was in her house was arrested and the heroin was introduced. As to how the arrest was made has been explained by the appellant in her evidence. Learned DSG submitted that according to the daughter, it has taken about 45 minutes for her mother to come back to the boutique. It does not contradict, but substantiates the version of the appellant. A witness however, cannot be expected to give the exact time in minutes or seconds

5

when giving evidence years after the incident. Lay witnesses do not keep notes as police officers who conduct raids. In that event, the evidence of the police witness PW1 who has kept his notes is more improbable than of the appellants daughter on the time. PW1 has received the information at 15.55. He has left for the raid within 5 minutes at 16.00 hrs. Within those five minutes he had contacted the team of about ten officers, informed all officers about the information, got the officers searched, arranged the vehicle, got the vehicle searched, which is highly improbable to do all that in five minutes. The position of the defence is that the story of receiving the information is a farce. 10. The learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself of the fact, when

he said at page 38 (page 450 of the brief) of his judgment that the appellant has not taken up the position that no heroin was found in her possession. Therefore, it is clear that the learned High Court Judge has failed to give due consideration to the defence evidence and has rejected the defence evidence on wrong premise.

11. In his judgment at page 44 (page 456 of the brief) the learned High Court

Judge has said that the appellant could have listed and called witness Fonseka to substantiate the position that she was arrested by Fonseka. Fonseka is the witness No.2 in the indictment. In his evidence PW1 said that Fonseka participated in the raid. The evidence of the appellant was that she was stopped and taken to Kusumas house by Fonseka. However, it was her evidence that she was searched by woman police officer Anusha. (Page 238 of the brief). The learned High Court Judge has clearly misdirected himself when he expected the prosecution witness Fonseka to be called by the defence, when in fact it was the evidence for the prosecution that Fonseka participated in the raid. Appellant never said that she was searched by Fonseka. She had been searched by Anusha. 12. Hence, I hold that there is merit in the grounds of appeal raised by the

appellant and accordingly appeal should succeed.

13. Appeal is allowed. Appellant is acquitted of both counts.
