Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

The Petitioner had been appointed as Assistant Director, Regional Education Services

on 10th October 2013 by the 27th Respondent, the University Grants Commission. The

Petitioner had thereafter been attached to the 1st Respondent, the Open University

of Sri Lanka and is subject to the disciplinary control of the 1st Respondent. The

Petitioner admits that she was required to serve a probationary period of three

years.

By letter dated 30th October 2013, the Petitioner had been assigned to the Ampara

Study Centre of the 1st Respondent. Having reported for duty at the Ampara Study

Centre, the Petitioner states that she had issues with the 28th Respondent, who, prior

to the appointment of the Petitioner, had been carrying out the functions that had

been assigned to the Petitioner.

By letter dated 9th October 2015 marked P3, the Petitioner had been requested to

appear before a Preliminary Investigation Committee appointed by the Vice

Chancellor of the 1st Respondent to inquire into examination malpractices that had

occurred at the Ampara Study Centre. The Petitioner states that she was

subsequently transferred to the main office of the 1st Respondent in November 2015.

In January 2016, the Petitioner had been issued with a charge sheet marked P5.

Having considered her response, the Council of the 1st Respondent had decided to

conduct a disciplinary inquiry and had appointed the 7th Respondent, Professor J.C.N.

Rajendra as the Inquiry Officer. It is admitted that:

(a) The inquiry was held over several days with the participation of the Petitioner;

(b) The prosecution and the defence had each led the evidence of three persons; and

(c) The Petitioner did not give evidence at the inquiry.

For the reasons set out in his report dated 6th April 2018, the 7th Respondent had

found the Petitioner guilty of six of the eight charges in P5. Having considered the

said report, the Council of the 1st Respondent had decided to terminate the services

of the Petitioner with immediate effect. This decision had been communicated to the

4

Petitioner by the 1st Respondent by letter dated 28th May 2018 marked P12.

Aggrieved by the said decision, the Petitioner had filed an appeal with the University

Services Appeals Board (USAB).

The appeal filed by the Petitioner was taken up for hearing before the USAB on 23rd

July 2019, where the Petitioner was represented by an Attorney-at-Law. According to

the proceedings of that date, the primary argument of the Petitioner had been that

the main witness, the 28th Respondent bore a grudge towards her and therefore

implicated her. The USAB had heard the submissions of the parties and thereafter

recorded the following as being the four matters that required a determination by

the USAB:

1) Should the University act on the evidence of the 28th Respondent?

2) Should the Petitioner have disclosed that her husband was a candidate at the

examination where the custody of the question papers had been entrusted to

her?

3) Did the Petitioner as a probationary officer know that she had to disclose such

fact?

4) Is the decision of the 1st Respondent to terminate her services too harsh?

In its Order dated 10th December 2019 marked P19, the USAB, while stating that the

credibility of a witness must be determined by the Inquiry Officer, has held as

follows:

... this Board notes that the charges are in respect of undue interferences in the

examination process of a Higher Educational Institution. Such interferences

affect the credibility of the examination process and tarnish the image of the

Institution in the public eye. Once charges have been proved against an

employee in respect of such offences, this Board is of the view that the

Governing Body is at liberty to decide whether it would be advisable to retain

such an employee in the services of the Institution. In these circumstances, this

Board is of the view that the punishment of termination of services cannot be

considered as unduly harsh.

5

The USAB had thereafter dismissed the appeal of the Petitioner. Aggrieved by the

decision of the USAB, the Petitioner filed this application, seeking inter alia the

following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the charge sheet marked P5;

b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the Inquiry Report marked P7;1

c) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the letter of termination marked P12;

d) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the USAB marked P19.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that he is seeking the above relief

on the following four grounds:

1) There was no evidence to establish the charges against the Petitioner.

2) The rejection of the application of the Petitioner to be represented by an

Attorney-at-Law was contrary to the provisions of the Establishments Code.

3) The charge sheet issued to the Petitioner has not been approved by the

Council.

4) The Inquiry Officer was a member of the Council, which took the decision to

terminate the services of the Petitioner.

Section 86 of the Universities Act has provided a person employed by a University

who is dismissed from service a right of appeal to the USAB against such decision. If

that statutory remedy is availed of by an employee, he or she must plead before the

USAB all complaints and grievances with regard to the action taken by the University,

thus enabling the University to place its side of the story before the USAB. This would

in return provide the USAB the opportunity of considering all matters of fact and

arrive at a suitable decision.

1 What has been marked as P7 is a letter written by the Petitioner.

6

Where a person dissatisfied with a decision of the USAB invokes the Writ jurisdiction

of this Court, this Court can consider if the decision of the USAB is illegal,

unreasonable or whether there has been any procedural irregularity in the manner in

which the appeal was heard by the USAB. In considering the decision of the USAB,

this Court would be cautious to confine its review to the issues that were raised

before the USAB. It would not be proper for this Court to consider issues that are

being raised for the first time before this Court. It is clear from the four questions

that have been identified by the USAB, to which I will advert to later, that the

Petitioner has not raised during the hearing before the USAB, the issue relating to

her request to retain the services of an Attorney-at-Law and the issue relating to the

charge sheet not being approved by the Council of the 1st Respondent.

Be that as it may, I shall now proceed to consider each of the issues raised before

this Court by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner.

The first argument of the Petitioner is that there was no evidence to establish the

charges against the Petitioner. As Lord Brightman stated in the House of Lords in

Chief Constable of North Wales Police v Evans: 2

Judicial review is concerned, not with the decision, but with the decision

making process. Unless that restriction on the power of the court is observed,

the court will in my view, under the guise of preventing the abuse of power, be

itself guilty of usurping power..... Judicial review, as the words imply, is not an

appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner in which the decision was

made.

This Court can consider the factual circumstances and the evidence that was

considered by the Inquiry Officer where an argument is presented, as in this

application, that the punishment is excessive, or where an argument is taken that

there was no material at all to arrive at a decision, resulting in an error on the face of

the record. Even in such cases, Courts will only consider the factual circumstances to

the extent of determining whether the decision maker took into account relevant

considerations from the evidence placed before him, in making a decision. If a

decision has been influenced by considerations which either expressly or implicitly

2 [1982] 1 WLR 1155 at 1174.

7

cannot lawfully be taken into account, a Court may hold that such power has not

been exercised validly. The reasons provided for a decision would allow Courts to

effectively scrutinize the decision and detect what factors have influenced the

decision maker.

According to the report of the Inquiry Officer, the charges against the Petitioner are

as follows:

1) Having been entrusted with the custody of the question paper packets for the

Final examination of the Postgraduate Diploma of Special Needs Education held

at the Ampara Study Centre from 19th July 2nd August 2014, the Petitioner

failed to disclose to the 1st Respondent the fact that her husband was a

candidate at the said Final examination, thereby failing to act in terms of

Section B-43 of the Procedural Manual issued by the 1st Respondent;

2) Opening a packet containing the question paper relating to the said

examination and taking home a question paper, prior to the date of the

examination;

3) Taking home a blank answer book after having the date of the examination

affixed thereon by a staff member;

4) Allowing the answer scripts of her husband to be replaced by an answer script

brought from home;

5) Allowing her husband to be engaged in supervision/invigilation duties at the

said examination;

6) Allowing her husband to take away the packets containing the answer scripts in

order to be sent for correction without following the due procedure of handing

it over to a courier company;

7) By the above actions, the Petitioner has breached the trust reposed in her by

the 1st Respondent;

8

8) By the above actions, the Petitioner had tarnished the reputation of the post

held by the Petitioner and the image of the 1st Respondent.

As noted earlier, the Inquiry Officer had exonerated the Petitioner of Charge Nos. 4

and 5, but had found her guilty of Charge Nos. 1-3 and 6-8.

The primary grievance of the Petitioner, both before the USAB as well as before this

Court was that the Inquiry Officer has failed to evaluate the evidence of the

witnesses, and in particular failed to consider the following:

a) The fact that the 28th Respondent had admitted that she bore a grudge against

the Petitioner;

b) The fact that the evidence of P.G.U.K. Gunasinghe was in her favour

I have examined the Inquiry Report and find that the Inquiry Officer has not acted on

the evidence of Gunasinghe relating to Charge Nos. 2 and 3 as it had transpired

during the Inquiry that the Petitioner and her husband had visited the residence of

Gunasinghe and unduly influenced Gunasinghe to give evidence in favour of the

Petitioner, and even offered money to Gunasinghe for doing so. Due to the pressure

brought upon him, Gunasinghe had recorded the conversations that had taken place

between him, the Petitioner and her husband, and the said recordings had been

played before the Inquiry Officer. It is interesting to note that the Petitioner had

admitted during the Inquiry that the female voice on those recordings is that of the

Petitioner.

In his report, the Inquiry Officer has recorded the relevant parts of the conversations

that the Petitioner and her husband had with Gunasinghe, and arrived at the

following findings:

During the 11th inquiry session, Mr. P.G.U.K. Gunasinghe revealed that the

accused along with her husband Mr. A.S.M Nafeer repeatedly pressurized him to

give evidence in favour of the accused. He also complained that the accused

visited his boarding place once and the accuseds husband visited him twice. He

further stated that due to the continuous pressure, he was deeply disturbed and

9

has mentally suffered. This continuous pressure led him to record the

conversations.

It is evident and could be concluded that the accused and her husband Mr.

A.S.M Nafeer has continuously pressurized and troubled Mr. P.G.U.K.

Gunasinghe to give evidence in favour of them.

It is clear that the accused was trying her level best to bribe Mr. P.G.U.K.

Gunasinghe with money and trying to trap him, and pressurise him so that the

witness statements will be in favour of her.

I must note that the Petitioner has very conveniently avoided mentioning anything

about the recorded conversations to this Court.

The Inquiry Officer has arrived at similar findings with regard to the 28th Respondent

trying to influence Gunasinghe and another employee, Senaratne. The Inquiry Officer

had in fact recommended that the conduct of the 28th Respondent be further

investigated.

The fact that the Petitioner was in charge of the said examination and the fact that

her husband sat for the said examination has not been denied by the Petitioner. The

defence of the Petitioner was that a copy of the said Manual was not made available

to her and that she was unaware of such a requirement. The factual position

however is that the Petitioner has been in employment with the 1st Respondent since

2009 until her appointment in 2013 to a permanent position. In my view, it is

elementary that one cannot be in charge of question papers of an examination which

your spouse is due to sit as a candidate.

The Inquiry Officer, in finding the Petitioner guilty of Charge No. 1, had stated that

the letter of appointment issued to the Petitioner specifically states that she is bound

by the Rules and Regulations of the 1st Respondent. In terms of Rule B-43 of the said

Rules, It is the responsibility of those involved in examination work to declare any

close relationship/s they have with candidates. When a relative of a member of staff

10

sits an examination, the staff member should refrain from relevant examination

functions and not accept examination duties on his/her part.3

The Inquiry Officer has proceeded on the basis that the Petitioner ought to have

disclosed this fact to the 1st Respondent, as required by the Procedural Manual. The

Petitioner, being the custodian of the question paper packets should therefore have

acted with integrity and declared that her husband was a candidate at the said

examination and recused herself from examination duties, which the Petitioner

failed to do. It must be noted that even if the position of the Petitioner that the 28th

Respondent bore a grudge towards her is accepted, that does not affect the finding

of guilt with regard to Charge No.1. Hence, there is no merit in the argument that

there was no evidence with regard to Charge No.1.

With regard to Charge Nos. 2, 3 and 6, it is clear that the evidence of the 28th

Respondent is sufficient to support such charges. Whether a witness bore a grudge

or not and whether that witness is trying to implicate the accused, or in other words,

the demeanour and credit worthiness of a witness, are matters that must be best left

to the Inquiry Officer. It is certainly not the function of this Court in the exercise of its

writ jurisdiction to consider such matters.

In finding the Petitioner guilty of Charge No. 7, the Inquiry Officer has acted on the

failure of the Petitioner to disclose her relationship and conflict of interest, which he

has considered as being a serious breach of discipline. In finding the Petitioner guilty

of Charge No. 8, the Inquiry Officer has acted on the evidence of Gunasinghe that the

Petitioner and her husband had influenced and pressurized him. The Inquiry Officer

had concluded by stating that:

From the facts and evidence it is clearly visible that Mrs. Nazeefa and her

husband have continuously pressured, influenced and attempted to probe Mr.

Gunasinghe who is one of the prime witnesses for this inquiry. These actions by

Mrs. Nazeefa has proved that she is dishonest and not trustworthy person to

handle administrative and responsible work at the Open University.

3 A copy of the said Rule has been tendered with the Written Submissions of the 1st Respondent.

11

The Inquiry Officer has clearly proceeded on the basis that the conduct of the

Petitioner in trying to exert pressure on the witness, is scandalous, to say the least.

The Inquiry Officer has not considered the evidence of the 28th Respondent in finding

the Petitioner guilty of Charge Nos. 7 and 8.

It is therefore clear that the Inquiry Officer has found the Petitioner guilty of three

charges on the Petitioners own conduct, as opposed to the evidence of the 28th

Respondent or Gunasinghe. In the above circumstances, I do not see any merit in the

first argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner.

The second argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was that the

Petitioner was not permitted to retain the services of an Attorney-at-Law. In terms of

Paragraph 10.2 of the University Establishments Code, an accused person who

wishes to be represented by a defence officer must obtain the permission of the Vice

Chancellor. The learned State Counsel submitted that the Petitioner has been

represented by a defence officer at the commencement of the Inquiry as permitted

by the Establishments Code and that she continued to be represented by such officer

until the Petitioner made a request by letter dated 16th February 2017 marked P7

that she be permitted to retain the services of an Attorney-at-Law. By letter dated 3rd

March 2017 marked P8, the 2nd Respondent had informed the Petitioner that her

request cannot be granted as neither the Inquiry Officer nor the Prosecuting Officer

are Attorneys-at-Law.

The learned State Counsel submitted that the Council of the 1st Respondent had

taken a decision that Attorneys-at-Law will not be permitted at inquiries due to the

delays that are caused; that this decision had been applied across the board; and

that there was no justification to deviate from that decision. It was submitted further

that the Petitioner continued to be represented by a defence officer. The Petitioner

has not raised this issue at the hearing before the USAB. In any event, there is no

material that the Petitioner has been prejudiced by the said decision of the 1st

Respondent. For all of the above reasons, I do not see any merit in the second

argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner.

12

The third argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was that the charge

sheet issued to the Petitioner had not been approved by the Council. The learned

Counsel for the Petitioner relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in University

of Ruhuna and Others vs Dr. Dharshana Wickremasinghe4 where it was held that

the charge sheet issued to a teacher must be approved by the Council. This argument

too has not been taken up at the hearing before the USAB, thus making the

opportunity of preferring an appeal to the USAB an exercise in vain. The learned

State Counsel submitted that the Petitioner is not a teacher or officer. He submitted

that disciplinary control in respect of any person who is not a teacher or officer can

be delegated by the Council to the Vice Chancellor and that the charge sheet P5 has

been signed by the Vice Chancellor. Periodic reports of the Inquiry relating to the

Petitioner have been placed before the Council.5 Thus, it is clear that the above

judgment has no application to the facts of this application, and that there has been

compliance with the provisions of the Universities Act. In the above circumstances, I

do not see any merit in the third argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner.

The final argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was that the Inquiry

Officer was a member of the Council that took the decision to terminate the services

of the Petitioner. This too has not been raised at the hearing before the USAB. It is

indeed ironical that the Petitioner is complaining of a conflict of interest on the part

of the Inquiry Officer. Be that as it may, the learned State Counsel, while admitting

that the Inquiry Officer was a member of the Council having been nominated by the

Senate, submitted that the Inquiry Officer did not participate in the decision making

process relating to the Petitioner.

I have examined the minutes of the meetings of the Council held on 22nd July 2016,

26th August 2016, 21st October 2016, 18th November 2016, 31st March 2017, 28th

April 2017, 26th May 2017 and 30th June 2017, and observe that the 7th Respondent

has recused himself from each of the said meetings when matters relating to the

Petitioner were taken up for discussion.6 Thus, I see no merit in this argument.

4 SC Appeal No. 111/2010; SC Minutes of 9th December 2016. 5 Vide Minutes of the meetings of the Council which have been annexed to the Written Submissions of the 1st Respondent. 6 The minutes of the meeting have been tendered with the Written Submissions of the 1st Respondent.

13

The learned State Counsel submitted further that the Petitioner is guilty of

suppression, in that even though the Petitioner is complaining that the Inquiry

Officer failed to evaluate the evidence, the Petitioner has deliberately refrained from

producing the entire proceedings before the Inquiry Officer. This argument has much

merit, especially with regard to the suppression of the tape recordings between the

Petitioner, her husband and Gunasinghe. It is trite law that a litigant must come to

Court with clean hands, which the Petitioner has failed to do. I am therefore of the

view that this application is liable to be dismissed on this ground alone.

The learned State Counsel submitted further that the Petitioner was employed in a

position of trust and confidence by the 1st Respondent, and that by her failure to

disclose her conflict of interest, she has breached a core aspect of the employer

employee relationship. I agree with the said submission as it explains the reason why

the 1st Respondent decided to terminate the services of the Petitioner, and why that

punishment is not disproportionate to the charges against the Petitioner.

In the above circumstances, I do not see any legal basis to issue formal notice of this

application on the Respondents. This application is accordingly dismissed, without

costs.
