The instant application for revision has been filed to set aside the order dated

17.12.2020 of the learned High Court Judge of Colombo.

In the instant application the accused petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

petitioner) has been travelling in a three wheeler with his wife on 16.6.2016

when they were taken in to custody by the police for allegedly being in

possession of 27.75 grams of heroin concealed in the waist of the petitioner.

The Government Analyst report has been received on 30.11.2016, and the

petitioner and his wife had been indicted in the Colombo High Court and the wife

of the petitioner had been enlarged on bail.

The Counsel for the petitioner had moved the High Court for bail on the basis

that the petitioner is mentally sick due to depression and anxiety which had been

treated by the remand hospital, and the learned High Court Judge had refused

bail, and being aggrieved by the said order the instant application for bail has

been filed.

The Counsel for the petitioner urged the following grounds on behalf of the

petitioner,

1) His mental illness, 2) His wife being granted bail, 3) The petitioner being in remand since 2016 4) Pandemic situation in the country.

The State Counsel appearing for the Attorney General sated that the Counsel for

the petitioner has not urged any exceptional ground, therefore, for the

application to be dismissed.

Upon considering the submissions of both sides it is the considered view of this

Court, that according to the provisions of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance amended by Act nu 13 of 1984, section, 83 (1) states as,

.no person suspected or accused of an offence under section 54A or section 54B

of this ordinance shall be released on bail except by the High Court on

exceptional grounds.

The above mentioned exceptional grounds have been defined in many a legal

authorities in our country and in the case of CA Revision Application nu CA( PHC)

APN 147/17 Wickramasinghe J had carefully analyzed the term exceptional

circumstances in a similar case.

In the instant application the mental illness referred to by the petitioner has been

treated by the remand hospital and has been referred to a physician and the

physician had said that he had not seen the petitioner but the mother of the

petitioner had briefed him ,therefore the physician had recommended a review

of his case, but this Court observes that the petitioner had not taken steps to

make an application to the relevant authorities for necessary action. Hence it is

the view of this Court that the medical condition of the petitioner is not

worsened by his incarceration and it can be redressed by making the relevant

application to the relevant authorities, therefore this Court has to decide that the

condition referred to by the petitioner can be attended to in the remand hospital.

The Counsels submission that the wife of the petitioner being enlarged on bail

who is supposed to have aided and abetted the petitioner, cannot be considered

in favor of this suspect because the petitioner had exclusive possession of the

heroin at the time of arrest, prima facially as per the objections of the

Page 5 of 5

Respondents which the petitioner had not denied, furthermore he had

committed the instant offence while being on bail for a similar offence.

Thirdly the pandemic situation in the country cannot be considered as

exceptionally if it is not supported by other suitable grounds as held by this Court

in a previous application of similar nature.

Therefore upon considering the gravity of the offence and the sentence involved

if the petitioner is found guilty at the trial ,the petitioner failing to appear in

Court to, face the trial ,upon bail granted is very high according to the

considered view of this Court. Therefore the fact that the trial has not

commenced even though the indictment has been served this Court is unable to

endorse,hence this Court directs the Hon Attorney General to take steps to

expedite this trial in view of the period of incase ration of the petitioner since his

arrest.

Therefore as such this Court, sees no exceptionality in the grounds urged by the

petitioner, hence the instant application for revision is hereby dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
