Learned Counsel for the Petitioner is not present.

This matter had been mentioned for support in January, 2020 and learned

Counsel also had obtained many dates in order to support this matter.

Today also it is been mentioned for support. Petitioner does not seem to be

having any interest in this matter. On that basis, this bench dismisses this

application.
