Written Submissions on: 03.02.2021 (by the 1(a)(a) and 15th Defendant-

MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The appeal bearing No. CA/DCF/651/97 has been preferred by the 7th,

8th, 9th and 10th Defendant-Appellants and the appeal bearing No.

CA/DCF/653/97 has been preferred by the 1st and 15th Defendant-

Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the respective Defendants) from

the judgment of the learned District Judge of Mount-Lavinia dated

25.08.1997. It is borne out from the appeal brief that the petition of

appeal has not been tendered pertaining to the appeal bearing No.

CA/DCF/652/97. As such, this judgment is in respect of the petitions of

appeal tendered by the 7th to 10th and 1st, and 15th Defendants.

The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff)

instituted action to partition the land called Sambuddi Delgahawatta and

Delgahawatta which is morefully described in the schedule to the plaint,

among the co-owners as set out in paragraph 13 of the same.

After trial, the learned District Judge of Mount-Lavinia delivered the

impugned judgment to partition the subject matter as set out in the

judgment. Being aggrieved by the judgment, the 7th to 10th, 1st and 15th

Defendants have preferred these appeals.

At the trial, the parties to the action have admitted the pedigree set out

in the plaint (vide admission No. 01). Accordingly, the dispute is confined

to the identification of the corpus sought to be partitioned. The

Preliminary plan bearing No. 326 dated 04.06.1991 made by C.D.S.

Gunathilake, Licensed Surveyor has been marked as X and the report

of the Commissioner is produced as X1. The determination of the

learned District Judge was that the lots comprising A, B, C and D in plan

X should be the corpus in this case.

Page 11 of 20

Appeal bearing No. CA/DCF/651/97

In their petition of appeal, the 7th to 10th defendants raised several

grounds of appeal. However, in accordance with the points of contest

Numbers 4 to 8, raised by these Defendants, the grounds of appeal are

properly identified as follows:

1. The larger land is not depicted in the preliminary plan marked X.

2. The 8th and 9th Defendants have acquired prescriptive title to Lot-

B in plan X.

It is the contention of these Defendants that the entirety of the corpus

has not been shown in plan X.

In partition actions, if a party to the action is of the view that the entire

land has not been depicted in the preliminary plan, such party is

permitted to take necessary steps to survey the entirety of the subject

matter in terms of section 16 (2) of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977 (as

amended), which reads thus:

The court may, on such terms as to costs of survey or

otherwise, issue a commission at the instance of any party

to the action, authorizing the surveyor to survey any larger

or smaller land than that pointed out by the plaintiff where

such party claims that such survey is necessary for the

adjudication of the action.

It is to be noted that the aforesaid Defendants have not availed

themselves of this provision of law, and therefore, they are precluded from

taking up such a position in appeal.

Be that as it may, I shall now ascertain as to whether the subject matter

has properly been identified in plan X.

Page 12 of 20

The Plaintiff instituted this partition action to partition the land called

Sambuddi Delgahawatta and Delgahawatta, approximately in extent of 2

Acres. According to the preliminary plan marked X, the extent of the

land is 2 Acres and 5 Perches. It is to be noted that there is no

considerable disparity, as far as the extent of the subject matter is

concerned, between the land described in the schedule of the plaint and

the land depicted in the preliminary plan.

Boundary As per the schedule of the plaint, the corpus sought to be partitioned is bounded

The land depicted in the preliminary plan is bounded

Page 13 of 20

It is pertinent to be noted that all four boundaries of the land described

in the schedule to the plaint tally with the four boundaries of the land

depicted in the preliminary plan.

In the case of Gabrial Perera v. Agnes Perera [1950] 43 CLW 82, it was

held that,

In a deed the partition of the land conveyed is clearly

described and can precisely ascertained, a mere

inconsistency as to the extent thereof should be treated as

a mere false demonstration not affecting that which is

already sufficiently conveyed.

The above decision was followed in Yapa v. Dissanayake Sedara [1989]

1 Sri LR 361, and held that,

Inconsistency in extent will not affect the question of

identity if the portion of land conveyed is clearly described

and can be precisely ascertained.

In Welegedera Sekera v. Ratnapala (CA. No. 698/98F. CA Minutes

dated 12.09.2014) Chithrasiri, J. observed that,

Inconsistency in extent will not affect the question of

identity if the portion of land conveyed, is clearly described

and can be precisely ascertained. As mentioned before, the

land sought to be partitioned in this case had been

identified having looked at its boundaries and also by

referring to the manner in which it was possessed. [Vide

pp. 5-6]

Besides, the attention of this Court is drawn to the fact that these

Defendants have not put forward their contention before the

Commissioner that the entire land has not been surveyed, and also the

preliminary plan and the report to the same have been produced without

any objections by these Defendants.

Page 14 of 20

In these respects, this Court is of the considered view that the contention

of the 7th to 10th Defendants stating that the entirety of the subject matter

has not been shown in plan X is devoid of merits.

I shall now deal with the claim of prescriptive title of the 8th and 9th

Defendants in respect of lot B in plan X.

Indeed, these Defendants are co-owners of the subject matter. Generally,

one co-owner is in possession of common land on behalf of the other co-

owners. If a co-owner claims prescriptive title against other co-owners, it

is necessary to prove ouster in addition to the requirements set out in

section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, No. 22 of 1871 (as amended).

In Corea v. Appuhamy [1911] 15 NLR 65, it was held that,

A co-owner's possession is in law the possession of his co-

owners. It is not possible for him to put an end to that

possession by any secret intention in his mind. Nothing

short of ouster or something equivalent to ouster could bring

about that result.

In the case of Wickramaratne and Another v. Alpenis Perera [1986] 1

Sri LR 190, the Court of Appeal observed that,

In a partition action, for a lot of land claimed by the plaintiff

to be a divided portion of a larger land, he must adduce

proof that the co-owner who originated the division and

such co-owner's successors had prescribed to that divided

portion by adverse possession for at least ten years from

the date of ouster or something equivalent to ouster. Where

such co-owner had himself executed deeds for undivided

shares of the larger land after the year of the alleged

dividing off it will militate against the plea of prescription.

Possession of divided portions by different co-owners is in

no way inconsistent with common possession.

Page 15 of 20

In Thilakaratne v. Bastian [1918] 21 NLR 12, the full bench of the

Supreme Court considered the meaning of adverse possession in an

exhaustive manner, which reads thus:

Possession by one co-owner is presumed as the possession

on behalf of all of the co-owners. For one co-owner to acquire

prescriptive title against the other co-owners, he shall prove

ten years exclusive possession after changing the nature of

the possession to one of adverse to the title of others.

In the case of Maria Fernando and Another v. Anthony Fernando

[1997] 2 Sri LR 356 (CA), Wigneswaran, J. clearly and briefly simplified

the requirements to acquire prescriptive title among co-owners as follows:

Long possession, payment of rates and taxes, enjoyment

of produce, filing suit without making the adverse party, a

party, preparing plan and building house on land and

renting it are not enough to establish prescription among co-

owners in the absence of an overt act of ouster. A secret

intention to prescribe may not amount to ouster.

In Maria Perera v. Albert Perera [1983] 2 Sri LR 399 (CA), B.E. De Silva,

J. and G.P.S. De Silva, J. (as he then was), observed that,

An amicable partition can be a starting point of prescription

even though no deed of partition or cross deeds or other

documents have been executed. But inclusive possession by

a co-owner for a period of 10 years alone cannot give rise to

prescriptive title. There must be the further important

element of all change of circumstances from which an

inference could reasonably be drawn that such possession

is averse to and independent of "all other co-owners. There

must be proof of circumstances from which a reasonable

inference could be drawn that such possession had become

adverse at some date ten years before action was brought.

Page 16 of 20

Mere exclusive possession for 20 years (by taking the

natural produce of the land) on a plan not signed by any of

the co-owners to whom the plaintiff claimed lots were

allotted cannot constitute proof of ouster. The possession of

a co-owner would not become averse to the rights of the

other co-owners until there is an act of ouster or something

equivalent to ouster.

K.D. De Silva, J. and H.N.G. Fernando, J. (Basnayake C.J. dissenting),

in the case of Abdul Majeed v. Ummu Zaneera [1959] 61 NLR 361,

decided that,

Proof that one of the co-heirs let out the premises and

appropriated to himself the entire rent (which was not much)

for thirty-seven years was insufficient, by itself, to bring the

case within section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

In Chelliah v. Wijenathan [1951] 54 NLR 337 at 342, Gratien, J. stated

that,

Where a party invokes the provisions of Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of

an adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of

proof rests squarely and fairly on him to establish a starting

point for his or her acquisition of prescriptive rights.

In Anthonidura Hemawathie and Others v. Anthodura Bastian Silva

and Others (CA/DCF/1132/99, CA Minutes dated 05.10.2021), this

Court echoed the above view as follows:

When a co-owner claims prescriptive title to the entirety of

the subject matter against the other co-owners such as in

the instant case, there is an onus cast on them to establish

the fact that they had prescribed to the entire corpus by

adverse possession against other co-owners for at least ten

Page 17 of 20

years from the date of ouster or something equivalent to

ouster. [Vide p. 9]

In the light of the above legal literature, it is abundantly clear that a

considerable prudence is always necessary to recognize prescriptive title

as undoubtedly it deprives the ownership of the party having paper title.

Therefore, it is to be reiterated that when a party invokes the provisions

of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the true

ownership of an adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of

proof rests fairly on him to establish the adverse possession by strong

and cogent evidence.

It is abundantly clear that the 8th and 9th Defendants totally failed to

adduce evidence to establish the purported claim of prescriptive title to

lot B in plan X in accordance with the foregoing determinations of the

apex Courts.

Furthermore, these Defendants have not claimed prescriptive title to lot

B before the Commissioner as well (vide X1-Report of the Commissioner).

The learned District Judge has rightly observed the fact that, at the trial,

the parties to the action have admitted the pedigree set out in the plaint

and the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th Defendants, in paragraph 6 of their

statements of objection, have stated that, the father of 8th and 9th

Defendant, Thomas/Almon obtained undivided rights as per the plaint.

Moreover, the 9th Defendant, while giving evidence before the learned trial

Judge, categorically admitted the fact, that the undivided right of

Pabliyana devolved on his father.

In these respects, it is evident that the 8th and 9th Defendants are in

possession of lot B in plan X as co-owners, and therefore, they cannot

claim prescriptive title to the same.

Page 18 of 20

Appeal bearing No. CA/DCF/653/97

The grounds of appeal advanced by the 1st and 15th Defendants are as

follows:

1. Whether the lot A in plan X has to be excluded from the corpus

sought to be partitioned on the footing that the 1st defendant has

acquired prescriptive title to the same.

2. Whether the lot D in plan X has to be excluded from the subject

matter on the basis that the same was part of Pahaladelgahawata.

Having framed the points of contest No. 9 and 10, the 1st Defendant took

up the position that he has obtained prescriptive title to lot A. Admittedly,

the 1st Defendant is a co-owner of this land. As I have already stated in

this judgment, if a co-owner claims prescriptive title against other co-

owners, it is necessary to prove ouster in addition to the requirements

set out in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, No. 22 of 1871 (as

amended).

It is pertinent to be noted that the 1st Defendant who was present before

the Commissioner has not claimed Lot A on prescription. As per the

report of the Commissioner marked X1, the 1st Defendant had claimed

only the improvements in lot A. The 15th Defendant, who is the son of the

1st Defendant, while giving evidence on behalf of the 1st Defendant

categorically admitted the fact that the larger land (co-owned property)

was not partitioned among the co-owners. The learned Trial Judge has

rightly observed the fact that the 15th Defendant failed to produce any

documents as to the payment of Municipal rates, though he took up the

position that the 1st Defendant had paid municipal rates pertaining to Lot

A in plan X. In order to establish the claim of the 1st Defendant, the deed

bearing No. 3285 dated 17.12.1971 is produced as 1V1. It appears to this

Court that an extent of 1 Acre out of the entire land, has been conveyed

by the said deed. As such, it is apparent that the vendor in 1V1 has

conveyed undivided 1 Acre from the corpus. Since the said 1 Acre is not

Page 19 of 20

identified in a plan, the 1st Defendant cannot take up the position that

the land described in the schedule to 1V1 is a divided portion, namely lot

A in plan X.

Having considered the totality of the evidence adduced, it is manifestly

clear that the 1st Defendant in this case totally failed to establish his

purported claim of prescriptive title to lot A.

I shall now deal with the second ground of appeal, whereas the 15th

Defendant contended that the lot D in plan X is part of

Pahaladelgahawatta.

It is to be noted that other than the bare statement of the 15th Defendant,

there is no iota of evidence to establish the contention of the 15th

Defendant. The title plan of Pahaladelgahawatta has not been

superimposed on the preliminary plan. Moreover, the 1st or the 15th

Defendant has not put forward such a claim before the Commissioner.

The learned trial Judge has drawn his attention to the fact that the

purported title deed of the 15th Defendant, namely 15V1, claiming title to

lot D has not been produced by the said defendant though the same was

marked at the trial. In a nutshell, having considered the evidence

adduced, it is abundantly clear that the 15th Defendant failed to adduce

adequate evidence to establish the fact that the lot D in plan X is part of

Pahaladelgahawatta, and therefore, the grounds of appeal advanced by

the 1st and 15th Defendants are devoid of merits.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no basis to interfere with the impugned

judgment of the learned District Judge of Mount-Lavinia.

Accordingly, I dismiss the appeals with costs, fixed at Rs. 50,000 (each

appeal) and affirm the impugned judgment.
