C.A. No. 281/2018 H.C. ColomboNo. 107/2017

R. Gurusinghe, J.

The Accused-Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Colombo for

committing offence punishable under Section 5(2) of the Offences against

Public Property Act, No. 12/1982 as amended by the Act No. 28 of 1999

read with Section 403 of the Penal Code.

Charges levelled against the Appellant are as follows:

On or about 3rd September 2005, the appellant had pawned four false

bangles to the Peoples Bank Liberty Plaza branch, pretending them as

3

gold bangles under the No. 5063296 to Emil Pathmarajan and obtained

Rs.40,000/-.

On or about 5thof September 2005, the appellant had pawned five false

bangles to the same bank pretending them as gold bangles under the No.

5063322 to Herath Hamige Punchi Bandara Seneviratne and obtained

Rs. 49,000/-.

On or about 7th of September 2005, the appellant had pawned four false

bangles pretending them as gold bangles under the No. 5063394 to

Herath Hamige Punchi Bandara Seneviratne and obtained Rs. 42,800/-.

After trial the appellant was convicted of all charges. He was sentenced

to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for each count and fined Rs.

120,000/- for the first count and Rs. 147,000/- for the second count and

Rs. 128,000/- for the third count. In default imposed rigorous

imprisonment for a period of two years each.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence the appellant

preferred this appeal.

When this appeal was taken up for hearing learned Counsel for the

Appellant submitted that the appellant was not proceeding to have the

conviction set aside. The appellant now seeks only a reduction of the

sentence.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondent submitted the

learned High Court Judge had set out reasons for the sentence imposed

on the appellant. If the appellant was indicted separately for the

charges, he would not be able to seek sentences to run concurrently. As

4

a general rule, even sentenced on the same day the sentences for each

offence should run consecutively.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondent submitted the

Judgment of the Supreme Court in the case Aswan Mohamed Riswan Vs.

Attorney General C.A. Revision No. C.A. (PHC) APM 141/2013, H.C.

Ratnapura H.C. No. 25/2010, Decided on 25th March 2015 which

stipulates guidelines regarding sentencing; where Justice K.T. Chithrasiri

has discussed the objectives of sentencing and the factors that should be

taken to consideration before a sentence is determined.

The following factors were enumerated in the aforesaid judgment.

(a) The maximum and the minimum (if any) penalty prescribed for the

offence;

(b) The nature and gravity/seriousness of the particular offence.

(c) The offenders culpability and degree of his/her responsibility for

the offence;

(d) Mental state of the accused at the time the offence was committed;

(e) Evidence as to pre-arrangement for the commission of the offence;

(f) The impact of the offence on any victim and the injury, loss or

damage caused as a result of the offence committed;

(g) Whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence and if so, the

stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or the stage at

which it was indicated;

(h) The conduct of the offender during the trial as an indication of

remorse or the lack of remorse;

5

(i) Any action taken by the offender to make restitution of the injury,

loss or damage arising from the offence, including his or her

willingness to comply with any order for restitution that a court may

consider;

(j) The offenders previous character, good or bad;

(k) Imprisonment should be used when no other sentence is

adequate;

(j) Proportionality between the crime and the sentence;

(m) Possibility of reforming the offender;

(n) To ensure consistency in deciding sentences;

(o) Presence of any aggravating or mitigating factors concerning the

offender or any other circumstance relevant to the commission of the

offence; and

The sentence under Section 4(2) of the Offences against the Public

Property Act is imprisonment of either description for a term not less

than two years but not exceeding twenty years and with the fine

Rs.1000/-or three times the amount in relation to each such offence was

committed, whichever amount is higher.

The sentence of Section 403 of the Penal Code is imprisonment of either

description for a term which may extend for seven years, and shall be

liable to fine.

In the case of Attorney General Vs. Gunaratne and others [1995] 2 SLR

240, the Court of Appeal imposed two years rigorous imprisonment for

accused convicted for robbery of public property. In that case the

accused were indicted on a charge of robbery of a sum of Rs.58,400/-

being public property. They pleaded guilty to the charge. Each accused

was sentenced to a term of two years rigorous imprisonment suspended

for a period of five years and ordered to pay a sum of Rs. 2500/- each as

State costs.

The Attorney General appealed against this order in respect of the

sentence imposed on the accused on the basis that the facts and

circumstances disclosed the commission of a serious offence and the

accused deserved a deterrent punishment.

The Court of Appeal set aside the sentence imposed by the learned High

Court Judge on 22.09.93 and imposed on each of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

accused-respondents a sentence of 2 years R.I. imposed on each of the

accused-respondent and a fine of Rs. 175,200/- In default, sentenced

each of the accused-respondent to a term of 2 years' R.I.

The maximum punishment for robbery armed with any deadly weapon is

twenty years of rigorous imprisonment. In that case the accused had

robbed Rs. 58,400/- of public money from a principal of a school. The

bag containing the money was grabbed by one of the accused. Thereafter

the accused went away having fired a shot in the air.

When comparing the case in hand and above referred to Attorney

General Vs. Gunaratne and others (Supra) a term of 36 years of

imprisonment can be considered as excessive.

In the case of Soman vs State of Kerala on 14 December, 2012, the

Supreme Court of India had observed the lack of guidelines regarding

punishment. Paragraph 12 of that Judgment states as follows;

12. Giving punishment to the wrongdoer is at the heart of the criminal

justice delivery, but in our country, it is the weakest part of the

administration of criminal justice. There are no legislative or judicially laid

down guidelines to assist the trial court in meting out the just punishment

to the accused facing trial before it after he is held guilty of the charges.

In State of Punjab v. Prem Sagar the Supreme Court of India observed as

follows;

2. In our judicial system, we have not been able to develop legal principles

as regards sentencing. The superior courts except making observations

with regard to the purport and object for which punishment is imposed

upon an offender, have not issued any guidelines. Other developed

countries have done so.

(https://indiankanoon.org/doc/27726153/ accessed 30.3.2021)

We also have the issue of inconsistency and disproportionally of

punishment because of the lack of guidelines regarding sentencing.

Ordinarily, when offences arise out of unrelated facts or incident

consecutive sentences would be appropriated. However, it is our view

that to impose consecutive sentences for offences committed at the same

time exceeding the statutory maximum is undesirable.

The sentence should not be greater than the culpability of the offender.

It is difficult to arrive at a just and proportionate sentence for multiple

offending simply by adding together notional single sentences. The

offenders behaviour together with the factors personal to the offender

and other factors should be considered.

8

Now the age of the appellant is 57 years. He is suffering from a kidney

disease. Life expectancy of a male in Sri Lanka is 72 years. Further, the

accused had made an admission under Section 420 of the Criminal

Procedure Code. When considering the above factors, we are of the view

that the aggregated length a term of 36 years of imprisonment is not

proportionate. Therefore, we order that ten years of rigorous

imprisonment for each count should run concurrently.

We further direct that the sentence is deemed to have been served from

the date of the conviction namely, 14th November 2018. Terms in default

also reduce to one-year rigorous imprisonment for each fine. Fines

imposed on the appellant are not changed.

Subject to the changes of the sentence, appeal of the accused-appellant

is dismissed
