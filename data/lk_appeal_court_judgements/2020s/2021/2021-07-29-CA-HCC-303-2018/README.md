R. Gurusinghe, J

The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Kuliyapitya on two

counts, namely,

1. On or about 9th March 2009, at Dambadeniya within the jurisdiction of that

Court, the accused committed the offence of kidnapping a girl under age of

16 from legal guardianship punishable under Section 354 of the Penal Code

and,

2. The offence of grave sexual abuse punishable under Section 365 (b) (2) (b)

of the Penal Code as amended by Act Nos. 22 of 1995 and 29 of 1998.

After the trial, he was convicted of both charges and sentenced to five years

rigorous imprisonment for the first count with a fine of Rs.10,000/- and for the

second count 15 years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 10,000/- and

in default a term of six months and in addition, compensation of Rs. 500,000/-

to the victim with a default term of two years simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence, the appellant preferred

this appeal to this Court. When this appeal was taken up for hearing, the

3

learned assigned counsel for the appellant submitted that he would confine his

argument to the first ground of appeal.

The first ground of appeal is whether the learned Trial Judge had failed to take

into consideration that it was not safe to act upon the evidence of PW1

regarding the identification of the accused-appellant.

The argument for the appellant is that as per the evidence, PW1 did not

sufficiently acquaint with the accused-appellant, and therefore, identification

of the appellant in the Court is not safe to act upon.

This was taken up for trial about seven years after the incident, by which time

the appearance of the appellant had changed. At the time of trial, the appellant

had long hair and a beard. However, the PW1 and PW2 had identified him as

the person who committed the sexual abuse. The argument was that in

addition to the appellant, there were about 2-3 people who had worked at the

carpentry workshop. PW2, the mother of PW1 in the first complaint to the

police of Giriulla, had categorically stated that she knew the appellant very

well.

The PW1 and PW2 had shown the place where the alleged incident had taken

place. In the statement to the police, PW1 had referred to the appellant as

" " and not as "

".

One of the complaints of the appellant is that after the first date of trial, the

learned High Court Judge had kept PW1 in the custody of a home that night

and thereby unduly influenced PW1 to give evidence against the appellant.

This Court does not approve such a course adopted by the learned Trial Judge.

However, for that reason alone, an offender cannot be freed.

As the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondent has pointed out,

prior to placing PW 1 in custody at home on the first date of trial took place

4

where PW1 had stated that the person who had worked at Sanjeewa Mama's

carpentry workshop was the appellant.

On the first date of trial, PW1 stated as follows:

Even though she had not known the name of the appellant, she had given the

description of the appellant.

PW2, the mother of the victim, had stated that she went to fetch water with her

younger child. She had seen her elder son and daughter PW1 going to the carpentry

workshop. When she came back within five to ten minutes, only her son was at home.

He had told her that the appellant had asked for a box of matches. Then she had called

out to her daughter three, four times and had gone near the road. It was a small road,

and the carpentry shop was on the other side of the road. Then the victim had come

running, and after going home, the victim was crying. The victim told her that the

appellant had put her on the ground and touched her genital area.

When considering the evidence of PW1 and PW2 together, I get the impression that

they are truthful witnesses. We find no reason to disbelieve their evidence. There

6

were no contradictions; only two omissions were marked. However, those omissions

are not vital omissions. A complaint was lodged promptly. The history was given to

the doctor also tallies with the evidence in Court.

The alleged incident happened at about 5.00 p.m., in the evening of 9th March 2009. The

following day morning, a complaint was lodged with the Giriulla police. The appellant

was not a complete stranger to PW1 or PW2. Both of them had seen the appellant before

the incident. As per PW2's complaint, the appellant had been working at the carpentry

workshop about three, four months prior to the incident. She had seen him often. Even

though she had not known the name of the appellant, she had given the descriptions of

the appellant. She had explicitly stated that she knew the appellant very well.

According to the investigation officer's evidence, both PW1 and PW2 had shown the place

where the incident had taken place, and that was a ten-by-ten feet room, where the

appellant used to sleep. A camp bed which used by the appellant was also present in

the room.

In view of the aforementioned evidence, identification of the appellant cannot be

considered as mere dock identification. The appellant was a known person to PW1 and

PW2 for about three, four months prior to the incident. Therefore, there is no mistake

in the identity. There was no suggestion by the appellant at the trial that it could have

been someone else who had worked at the carpentry workshop. The learned High Court

Judge has considered the issue of the identification of the accused-appellant, and after

considering the evidence, he had come to a decision.

7

All the arguments about the identification of the appellant could have been correct if the

appellant was a complete stranger to the witnesses prior to the incident. There was no

allegation that PW1 or PW2 had given false evidence. The argument was that PW1 and

PW2 could have made a mistake in identifying the appellant. This argument cannot be

sustained in view of the above evidence.

There are no discrepancies that affect the credibility and trustworthiness of the

witnesses.

The order of the learned Trial Judge to keep PW1 in the custody of a home was

inappropriate. However, as I mentioned above, PW1 had identified the appellant and

described the incident before she was sent to a home to be present in the Court on the

following day.

The proviso to section 334(1} of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act states: -

'Provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of the opinion that the point

raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it

considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.'

In the case of Mannar Mannan V. The Republic of Sri Lanka 1987 (2) S.L.R94 it was held

that the purpose of the proviso is to prevent appeals being allowed on the basis of

technicality, regardless of whether prejudice has been caused or not to an accused

person.

Although the learned trial Judge had made this inappropriate order, the evidence

establishes the charge against the accused-appellant. The Court of appeal, in terms of

proviso to section 334 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act has the power to affirm a

conviction.

Therefore, I hold that there was no miscarriage of justice. The prosecution has proved

the case beyond a reasonable doubt.

8

For the above reasons, I refuse to interfere with the judgment of the learned trial Judge

and affirm the conviction.

The appellant has no previous convictions. He is now over 60 years old. As he was unable

to supply bail money and find a surety, he had been languishing in remand custody for a

long period. Considering the above facts, the punishment imposed for the second count

is reduced to ten years. The rest of the punishment is not changed.

However, we direct all the sentences to run concurrently and are deemed to have been

served from the date of the conviction, namely 26/11/2018.

Subject to the variation of the sentence, the appeal of the appellant is dismissed.
