He referred to the Sinhala version of Item 31 of the Inland Revenue Act and submitted that it refers to both profits and income of an undertaking and that it makes reference to an individual and thus, the concessionary rate in Item 31 applies both to business profits and income of such an undertaking who is either an individual or company. On this basis, Dr. Shivaji Felix contended that the concessionary tax rate referred to in Item 31 applies to an individual who is engaged in renting warehouses, and thus, the income received by the Appellant from renting warehouses qualifies for the preferential rate of tax, independent of whether rents received by such individual constitute business income or rental income.",

Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal (1961) 42 ITR 49, the question arose for consideration, whether the rental income that is received was to be treated as income from the house property or the income from the business. The Court took the view that the income derived by the company from shops and stalls is income received from the property and such income shall be treated as income from the house property and not income from a business (paragraph 3). The Court based its decision in the context of the main objective of the company and took the view that letting out of the property was not the object of the company at all. The Court was of the opinion that the character of that income which was from the house property had not altered because it was received by the company formed with the object of developing and setting up properties.

The profits earned in such a case are referable, not to the exercise of the rights of property or of occupation since the customers come on to the land for the purpose of obtaining refreshment or procuring the benefit of the services. If on the other hand, the owner of land having (let me suppose) a remarkable view or some historic monument merely allows the public to come on to the land in return for an admission fee, I cannot myself see why it should be said that his profits are not covered by the Schedule A assessment since all that he is doing is to exploit his right of property by grating licences to come upon the land. The fact that he keeps the paths in order or the monument in repair in order to make a visit more attractive to the public again appears to me to make no difference, any more than does the action of the landlord of a house in keeping it in repair.",

Governors of the Rotunda Hospital, [1921] 1 A.C.1, the House of Lords drew a clear distinction between a landowner who leases or lets his land to tenants and derives a profit from the rents from lessees and the landowner who utilises his land while retaining possession of it by hiring it out to be used by persons who do not take any estate or interest in the land itself. In the Rotunda case, concert and ball rooms were hired out to persons desirous of utilising them for the purposes of musical or dancing entertainments and the owners had equipped the rooms so as to make them available for those purposes.",

What is let, paid for and used is the room plus the services as \"constituting one composite whole, for which money is paid, and \"is obtained from the general public. In my opinion this letting \"is an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.",
