    "text": "Credibility is defined by Blacks Law Dictionary as the quality that makes something (as a witness or some evidence) worthy of belief. A witness whose evidence on a point is not credible cannot give reliable evidence on that point. The Ontario Court of Appeal describes the relationship between reliability and credibility as follows: Testimonial evidence can raise veracity and accuracy concerns. The former relate to the witnesss sincerity, that is, his or her willingness to speak the truth as the witness believes it to be. The latter concerns relate to the actual accuracy of the witnesss testimony. The accuracy of a witnesss testimony involves considerations of the witnesss ability to accurately observe, recall and recount the events in issue. When one is concerned with a witnesss veracity, one speaks of the witnesss credibility. When one is concerned with the accuracy of a witnesss testimony, one speaks of the reliability of that testimony. Obviously a witness whose evidence on a point is not credible cannot give reliable evidence on that point... (R V Morrissey; (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514, 80 O.A.C. 161 (Ont. C.A.).) Secondly, it casts a doubt on the ability of the prosecution in identifying the subject matter of the alleged theft.
