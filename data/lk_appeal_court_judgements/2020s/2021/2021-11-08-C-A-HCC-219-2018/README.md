R. Gurusinghe, J.

The Accused-appellant was indicted under Section 296 of the Penal Code

before the High Court of Galle for committing the murder of one

Kodagoda Mahesh Amarakeerthi on 22nd of February 2005.

After trial, the appellant was convicted and sentenced to death by the

learned High Court Judge.

At the trial, the appellant had taken up the defence of alibi. However,

when the appeal was taken up for hearing, counsel for the appellant

argued that the appellant could not be found guilty to the charge of

murder but culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

The facts of this case briefly are as follows:

The appellant and the deceased were well known to each other and said

to have been friends. The incident of stabbing had happened on the

22nd of February 2005 at around 7.00 p.m. A person had informed the

mother of the deceased PW1 that her son was lying fallen with a stab

injury. PW1 had rushed to her son within two or three minutes and

inquired what had happened. The deceased referring to the appellant

3

told his mother that . The deceased was then

taken to Imaduwa hospital and from there he was transferred to

Karapitiya Teaching Hospital. He succumbed to the injury after

admission to Karapitiya Hospital. As per the evidence of PW1, the

deceased was conscious and able to speak till he was brought to

Karapitiya Hospital.

According to the post-mortem report and the evidence of the doctor, only

one stab injury was found in the body of the deceased. The death of the

deceased did not occur immediately or soon after he received the injury.

The exact time of the incident is not clear. Around 7.00 and 7.30 p.m.

somebody had informed PW1 that her son was lying injured. PW1 says

that it was after 7.00 and before 7.30 p.m. The stab injury penetrated

through the lower ribs and has damaged the left side of the liver. The

heart and the lungs were not damaged. The cause of death is

hemorrhagic shock due to damage caused to the liver by the stab injury.

The doctor was of the opinion that the injury was sufficient to cause

death in the ordinary course of nature.

Section 293 of the Penal Code is as follows:

Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death,

or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause

death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death,

commits the offence of culpable homicide.

Section 294 of the Penal Code is as follows:

294. Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is

murder-

4

FirstlyIf the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention

of causing death; or

SecondlyIf it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as

the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom

the harm is caused; or

ThirdlyIf it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any

person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the

ordinary course of nature to cause death; or

FourthlyIf the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently

dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or such bodily injury

as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for

incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.

Culpable homicide is of two kindsculpable homicide amounting to

murder and culpable homicide not amounting to murder. After the

special characteristics of murder have been taken away from culpable

homicide what is left out of culpable homicide is culpable homicide not

amounting to murder. In the case of doubt, culpability must be

construed in favour of the accused.

The argument advanced for the appellant is that the appellant did not

have the requisite intent or knowledge of causing the death of the

deceased, and as such, his act was not amounting to murder. The

contention is that the appellant cannot be held guilty of murder under

Section 296 of the Penal Code but must have had at most been guilty of

culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

5

In this case, there are no eyewitnesses to the incident. The case for the

prosecution is based on circumstantial evidence. The deceased had told

his mother (PW1) that the appellant had stabbed him.

PW5 had seen the appellant and the deceased together at about 6.30

p.m. on that day. At that time, both the deceased and the appellant were

drunk. The appellant had stopped PW5 and asked him

? and stabbed him, that injured his hand. PW5 was 16 years at

that time. PW5 had run away from the scene.

Circumstances under which the stabbing took place were not revealed by

the evidence. Counsel for the respondent conceded that the accused

might not have had the intention to kill the deceased. However, he knew

that his actions would likely cause the death of the deceased.

The evidence does not prove that the appellant had intended to kill the

deceased or caused such injury that is sufficient in the ordinary course

of nature to kill the deceased. Whether the appellant had intended to kill

the deceased or caused a bodily injury likely to cause death or cause

bodily injury to the deceased sufficient in the ordinary course of nature

to cause death must be gathered from the facts and the circumstances of

the case. Since there were no eyewitnesses to the incident, the intention

or knowledge of the appellant should be construed from the

circumstantial evidence. If the accused-appellant intended the death of

the deceased, he could have inflicted more injuries to the deceased. In

this case, there was no prior enmity between the appellant and the

deceased. The appellant had inflicted only one stab injury. Both the

appellant and the deceased were seen drunk and arm in arm about half

an hour before the incident. The injury was not necessarily fatal.

The evidence is insufficient to attribute murderous intention on the

appellant.

6

In the circumstances, I set aside the conviction and the sentence of the

appellant for the murder of the deceased. I convict the accused-appellant

of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. I impose the accused-

appellant to eight years rigorous imprisonment. I direct that the sentence

is deemed to have been served from the date of the conviction, namely

09/08/2018.

Appeal allowed.
