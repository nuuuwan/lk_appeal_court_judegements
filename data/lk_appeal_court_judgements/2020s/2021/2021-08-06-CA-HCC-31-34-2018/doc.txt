R. Gurusinghe, J.

The accused-appellants (appellants) were indicted in the High Court of Ampara

for having committed the offences of,

3

i. Abduction of the prosecutrix to cause her defilement as punishable

under section 357 read with section 32 of the Penal Code under count

No. 1;

ii. Gang rape on the prosecutrix punishable under S.364 (g); read with

S.362(2) of the Penal Code in count 2-5 and

iii. Robbery of a sum of Rs. 3,000/- from the possession of PW2, an

offence punishable under Section 380 of the Penal Code.

After the trial by jury, all the appellants were found guilty by the verdict of the

jury.

The 1st accused-appellant was sentenced to 35 years of rigorous imprisonment

for counts 1, 2, and 6. In addition, there was a fine and a default term.

The second, third, and fourth accused-appellants were sentenced to 27 years

rigorous imprisonment each and a fine, with default terms.

The impugned Judgement and sentences were challenged before this Court on

several grounds.

The prosecution led the evidence of the prosecutrix (PW1), PW2, with whom

PW1 had a love affair at that time, and the medical officer who examined PW1.

In addition, the prosecution called the police officer who had conducted the

investigation.

4

As per the evidence of the prosecutrix, while she and PW2 were talking inside a

three-wheeler parked by the side of the road, the accused had accosted them.

The 1st accused had ordered PW2 to get down. Then the 1st appellant had

taken away the three-wheeler along with the victim and raped her. The other

three accused had held PW3 during that time. After that, the 1st accused had

forcibly taken the ID cards of the PW 1 and PW2, the documents relating to

the three-wheeler, from the PW 1 and PW2. He photocopied them at

Medagama, and set free the PW1 and PW2. While they were on the way home,

PW1 had informed PW2 as to what had happened.

They both agreed not to go to the police, as they were frightened to go to the

police. PW2 promised that he would marry the prosecutrix.

After about five months later, PW2 informed the prosecutrix and her family

that he could not marry her as he was impotent and had other burning issues

to attend.

After that, the prosecutrix made a complaint to the police.

The main ground of appeal is that the trial Judge had seriously misdirected the

jury. It was also submitted that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable in the

circumstance of the case.

The first accused-appellant gave evidence under oath before Court. The

prosecution marked several contradictions between his evidence in Court and

the statement he had made to the police while the first appellant was under

cross-examination. The statement of an accused person can only be used to

prove that he made a different statement at a different time. (Proviso to Section

110 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code Act). It is also subject to the

qualification that if the statement as a whole demonstrates that the accused

person had committed an offence or that it suggests the inference that he had

5

committed the offence, then it would come within the prohibition contained in

Section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance.

On page 612 of the brief, the 1st accused was cross-examined thus,

It is unbelievable that the learned counsel for the prosecution moved to mark

this portion as a contradiction in a rape case.

The effect of the above evidence clearly suggests that the 1st accused-appellant

confessed to the police.

9

Section 25 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance provides that no confession made to a

police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence.

In Obiyas Appuhamy v. Queen 54 NLR 32, the evidence was led that the

accused volunteered a statement to a police officer, who, thereupon,

immediately handcuffed the accused and took him to the scene of the offence.

It was held that such evidence was inadmissible. It is not solely evidence of the

actual terms of a confession that can be obnoxious to section 25 (1) of the

Evidence Ordinance, but also any evidence which if accepted would lead to the

inference that the accused made a confession to a police officer would be

inadmissible.

In deciding, whether a statement made to a police officer is within the meaning

of sections 17 and 25 of the Evidence Ordinance Basnayake CJ quoted the

following passage from Anandagoda v. Queen 64NLR 39 in the case of The

Queen v Abadda 66 NLR 397.

" The test whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, whether to

the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the

circumstance in which it was made it can be said to amount to a statement

that the accused committed the offence or which suggested the inference that

he committed the offence. The statement must be looked at as a whole and it

must be considered on its own terms without reference to extrinsic facts .... It

is not permissible in judging whether the statement is a confession to look at

other facts which may not be known at the time or which may emerge in

evidence at the trial. But equally, it is irrelevant to consider whether the

accused intended to make a confession. If the facts in the statement added

10

together suggest the inference that the accused is guilty of the offence then it is

nonetheless a confession even although the accused at the same time protests

his innocence. .... The appropriate test in deciding whether a particular

statement is a confession is whether the words of admission in the context

expressly or substantially admit guilt or do they taken together in the context

inferentially admit guilt ? "

The Court of Criminal Appeal adopted the same test in Punchi Banda v The

State 76NLR293

When taking into consideration the contradictions that were marked by the

State Counsel as a whole, it gives the impression that the accused made a

confession.

We are of the opinion that in the guise of marking contradictions, wholly

inadmissible evidence was improperly admitted violating the provisions of

section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance. It may have influenced the jury to accept

the evidence of PW1 and PW2 and reject the accused-appellants evidence. The

learned Trial Judge should have shut out these contradictions as they

amounted to a confession.

Furthermore, the Trial Judge has not directed the jury that the contradictions

cannot be considered as substantive evidence. The learned Trial Judge should

have warned the jury that the contradiction should not be taken as

corroborative evidence of PW1 and PW2.

11

In Babysingho v The Queen 75NLR 451, Sirimanne J stated as follows:

"A statement made by a witness outside Court may always be used for the

purposes of contradicting his evidence. Under section 157 of the Evidence

Ordinance, such a statement made at or about the time when an incident took

place can be used, within the limits (now authoritatively defined) in order to

show consistency, and thus corroborate the witness's evidence. The most

common example of this is the " First Information" on which investigations by

the police were initiated.

But, once a witness denies having made the statements attributed to him, as in

this case, the jury must be told that these statements do not form substantive

evidence on which they can act. Such statements- if the witnesses to whom

they had been made are believed-would tend to show that the person who now

denies them is unworthy of credit, but those statements cannot be substituted

for his evidence."

The prosecutrix made a complaint to the police after five months after the

incident. The explanation for the delay was that PW2 had agreed to marry her,

so she did not make a complaint. After about five months later PW2 said that

he was not in a position to marry her. This was the reason to complain. There

was no direction in this regard. The learned Trial Judge should have directed

the jury whether they could accept the explanation for the delay given by the

prosecutrix as plausible.

There are substantial contradictions between the evidence of PW1 and PW 2.

As the State does not support the verdict, we shall not refer them here.

12

The learned Deputy Solicitor General conceded that the conviction could not be

supported considering the Trial Judge's misdirection and non-direction to the

jury. He also pointed out that there was no direction with regard to gang rape

in the charge to the jury. No evidence had been led to show that the second,

third and fourth accused had abetted or had a common intention with the first

accused to do the alleged rape. They were nowhere near the place where the

alleged rape was committed. Therefore, the second, third and fourth accused

could not have been convicted for gang-rape charges.

We must appreciate the learned Deputy Solicitor General who has shown the

great spirit of Attorney Generals Chambers by conceding that the defence

version, in this case, is equally probable. He did not seek a retrial.

For the reasons set out above, the conviction and the sentence are set aside.

The four accused-appellants are acquitted of all charges.

The appeal is allowed.
