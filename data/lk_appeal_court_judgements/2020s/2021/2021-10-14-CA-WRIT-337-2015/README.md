MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioner in this application has invoked the supervisory

jurisdiction of this Court under Article 140 of the Constitution

seeking, inter alia, for the following relief:

(b) a mandate in the nature of writ certiorari, quashing the

Environmental Protection License (hereinafter referred to as the

EPL) issued to the 4th Respondent by the 5th Respondent

dated 28.01.2015 (marked P-15).

(c) a mandate in the nature of writ of mandamus, directing the 5th

Respondent or any one or more of the Respondents

abovenamed, to take steps according to law against the

operation of the garage at the above captioned premises by the

4th Respondent.

When this matter was taken up for argument, both parties had

consented to dispose the matter by way of written submissions that

have already been tendered.

The brief narration of facts for proper appreciation of the controversy

relevant for the purpose are as under.

Page 5 of 12

The Petitioner who is a resident at No. 871/2, Rukmale Road,

Kottawa, Pannippitiya had complained to the 1st Respondent

Authority for the first time on 14.08.2014 against the 4th Respondent,

of the serious health hazards caused to him and other family

members in the vicinity of his premises by the activities carried out by

the 4th Respondent in operating a bus repair garage at No, 871,

Rukmale Road, Kottawa, Pannippitiya.

On this complaint, the 1st Respondent Authority has caused a site

inspection on 05.09.2014. Through the observation of the site

inspection it was revealed, that at the time of the inspection, spray

painting in an open-air area and repairing of buses were carried out

in the premises in question, oil spills/seepage was observed in vicinity

of the garage.

Consequent to the said site inspection, the 4th Respondent was

informed by the 1st Respondent Authority in writing that, he was

required to stop spray painting with immediate effect and that it was

necessary for the 4th Respondent to obtain an EPL from the Local

Authority to continue with the garage (vide P-3).

As revealed before this Court, the Petitioner during the same period

had lodged several complaints with number of authorities including

Police Station Kottawa, Police Office Mirihana and Department of

Local Government of the Western Provincial Council.

After the 1st inspection by the officers of the 1st Respondent on

05.09.2014, another site inspection was carried out by the 1st

Respondent on 09.12.2014 and the report prepared by the officers of

the 1st Respondent Authority was produced before this Court marked

1R2, where the said officials have observed an improvement of the

cleanliness and organization of the said premises and at the time the

inspection carried out, spray painting work has been stopped. The

above findings were communicated to the parties by the 1st

Respondent by letter dated 29.12.2014 (P-14). Subsequent to this

Page 6 of 12

letter by the 1st Respondent, the 4th Respondent had applied for an

EPL from the relevant Local Authority i.e., Maharagama Municipal

Council and the said Council had issued the impugned EPL dated

28.01.2015 valid for a period of 3 years commencing from 05.12.2014

under part C of the Government Gazette No. 1533/16 dated

25.01.2008 (marked P-13).

It was further observed by this Court that another meeting was held

after issuing the said EPL on 25.05.2015 at the Central

Environmental Authority with the participation of several public

servants including officials from the Environmental Authority,

Maharagama Municipal Council and Police. At the said meeting it was

proposed to the Petitioner to monitor the conduct of the 4th

Respondent by the 1st Respondent - Central Environmental Authority

and Maharagama Municipal Council to make sure that the 4th

Respondent does not violate the conditions of the EPL. When the said

proposal was made to the Petitioner, the Petitioner did not agree for

the said proposal, since the Petitioner was of the view that the said

issuance of the EPL was made ultra vires by the 5th Respondent.

The Petitioner who was dissatisfied with the said decision by the 5th

Respondent to issue the 4th Respondent with an EPL dated

28.01.2015 had challenged the said decision prayed the relief as

submitted above.

Having elucidated the factual background of this petition, I shall now

turn to the issues before this Court and the submissions of respective

parties.

One crucial argument raised by the Petitioner in the written

submission was the effect of the zoning identified in the Development

Plan for the Urban Development Area of Maharagama published on

12.09.2008 for the period 2008-2020 as contained in Gazette

notification No. 1566/29 dated 12.09.2008 (marked P-21). In this

regard the Petitioner had taken up the position that, the said license

Page 7 of 12

has been issued to the 4th Respondent contrary to the National

Environment Act, No. 47 of 1980 for the reason that the said garage is

situated in a Residential Area contrary to the Zoning Plan 2008-2020

and as such ultra vires the powers conferred on the 5th Respondent.

Whilst submitting that the garage is situated in a Residential Area

identified under the Development Plan P-21, the Petitioner argued

that operating a garage is not identified a permissible user under the

said Development Plan. However, this position was disputed before

this Court by the 4th Respondent and submitted that the said area

comes under Mixed Development Area (vide para 22 of the Statement

of Objections filed by the 4th Respondent dated 16.11.2017), but the

Petitioner in support of his argument produced several letters marked

P-3, P-7 and P-20 confirming that the area in question comes within a

Residential area.

The 5th to 7th Respondents, concurring the position taken by the

Petitioner, submitted that the said garage belongs to the 4th

Respondent is situated in a Residential Area (vide para 18 and 19 of

the written submission dated 14.01.2019).

The 4th Respondent submitted that he has been carrying the garage

under the name and style of Kumara Motors which is a registered

industry (on or around 15.01.1993) of his mother under the Business

Names Ordinance (Chapter 149) incorporated by Business Names

Statute No. 4 of 1990. Accordingly, the 4th Respondent contended that

the said garage industry existed for longer period before the said

Development Plan P-21 came in to force that is the imposition of zone

regulation which came into force in 2008.

The learned Senior Additional Solicitor General who represented the

1st to 3rd and 8th to 12th Respondents also took up a comparable

position that the said Development Plan P-21 prepared under section

8 of the Urban Development Act, No. 41 of 1978 (hereinafter referred

to as the UDA Law) by its very nature cannot be retrospective in

Page 8 of 12

operation and zoning has to be done to be effective in the future. A

garage which was in operation at the time the Development Plan come

in effect cannot be removed from the area but, they have to be

regulated under the provisions of the prevailing legislature. In this

regard the learned Senior Additional Solicitor General submitted that

the National Environment Act, No. 47 of 1980 and the Regulations

made thereunder had provided the issuance of an EPL to cover

particular prescribed activities and section 23A of the amending Act

No. 53 of 2000 empowered the Minister to determine what activities

would require a license, being activities, which involve or results in

discharging, depositing or emitting waste into the environment

causing pollution.

In this regard, our attention was drawn to the Gazette Extra Ordinary

No. 1533/16 dated 25.01.2008 P-13 where the Minister had made

regulation under section 23A referred to above, and under part C

vehicle repairing or maintaining garages excluding spray painting as

an activity which requires a license under the said section.

The main grievance of the Petitioner is that the EPL issued to the 4th

Respondent is null and void because it has been issued in violation of

procedure set out in the Development Plan P-13. Per contra, the

learned Senior Additional Solicitor General for the 1st to 3rd and 8th to

12th Respondents and the Counsel for the 4th Respondent submitted

that the said Development Plan prepared under section 8 of the UDA

Law by its very nature cannot be retrospective in operation and zoning

has to be done to be effective in the future.

It is no doubt true that, in terms of section 8A (1) of the UDA Law (as

amended by Act, No. 4 of 1982), the Urban Development Authority

(UDA) shall having regard to the amenities and services to be provided

to the community, prepare a development plan for any development

area with a view to promoting and regulating the integrated planning

and physical development of lands and buildings in that area or part

Page 9 of 12

thereof. In the instant case, the 8th Respondent has prepared a

Development Plan for Maharagama Urban Council Area for the period

2008-2020 P-13. This has been approved by the relevant Minister in

terms of section 8F of the UDA Law. Therefore, in my view, the

Development Plan for Maharagama Urban Council Area for the period

2008-2020 has the force of law and are regulations within the

meaning of the law. Vide A.K.S. Sumanapala v. The Urban

Development Authority and Ten Others [C.A. (Writ) Application

754/2007, CA Minutes of 27.02.2020] at page 3 His Lordship

Justice Janak De Silva (as he then was) has taken a similar view.

Hence, I hold that the Development Plan 2008-2020 as contained in

Gazette notification No. 1533/16 dated 25.01.2008 prepared by the

Maharagama Urban Council (a subordinate legislative body), is within

the meaning of the law.

In fact, in the Gazette publication P-21, it is specifically stated that

the Plan will become effective only from the date of approval by the

Minister which was 07.08.2008. Therefore, as contended by the

learned Senior Additional Solicitor General, the said Zoning

Regulations cannot, reasonably, apply to any activities that had

commenced in the said Zones before 12.08.2008.

It is true that, a delegated legislation may have retrospective effect

only if the primary legislation containing the delegation either has

that effect or authorize the delegated legislation to have that effect,

no statute or order is to be construed as having a retrospective

operation unless such a construction appears very clearly or by

necessary and distinct implication in the Act (vide Thorntons

Legislative Drafting at page 424). This principle was adapted by

Sharvananda J. in the case of the Attorney General of Ceylon v.

Fernando, Honorary Secretary, Galle Gymkhana Club [1977] 79

(1) NLR 39. This view has recently been emphasized by His Lordship

Priyantha Jayawardena, PC. J, in Dr. K.M.L. Rathnakumar v. The

Postgraduate Institute of Medicine [SC Appeal No. 16/2014, SC

Page 10 of 12

Minutes of 30.03.2016]. A similar approach has followed by the

Indian Supreme Court - vide Indramani Pyarelal Gupta v. Nathu

and Others 1963 AIR 274 and Mohan Reddy Etc v. Charles and

Others AIR 2001 SC 1210.

Joseph A.L. Cooray in his work Constitutional and Administrative

Law of Sri Lanka (June 1995) at page 329 says The doctrine that

subordinate legislation is invalid if it is ultra vires, is based on the

principle that a subordinate agency has no power to legislate other than

such as may have expressly been conferred by the supreme

Legislature. Subordinate legislation is fundamentally of a derivative

nature and must be exercised within the periphery of the power

conferred by the enabling Act. For example, subordinate legislation

having retrospective effect is ultra vires unless the enabling Act

expressly or by necessary implication authorizes the making of

retrospective subordinate legislation. At page 323 the author further

states Unless Parliament has in the enabling or parent Act expressly or

impliedly authorized the sub-delegation, the maxim delegatus non

potest delegare applies to make the sub-delegation unlawful.

However, this Court observed that there is no proof has been

furnished by the 4th Respondent that the said garage had been in

operation prior to the year 2008. In his Statement of Objections, the

4th Respondent stated that he operates a garage under the name and

style of Kumara Motors at the abovementioned premise where he

utilizes to park motor coach-vehicles belonging to his family members.

To substantiate these facts the 4th Respondent annexed copies of the

certificate of registration of the motor vehicles and Passenger Service

Permits for Regular Passenger Carriage Services belonging to his

family members as X1 to X12. It is to be noted that all these

documents had been obtained from the relevant authorities around

2014-2015. Further, the 4th Respondent also contended that the

Building Plan bearing No. BA5/2005/25 marked P-16A was an

extension to the existing building in which he was operating the said

Page 11 of 12

garage. However, the said building approval granted to the 4th

Respondent was valid for only one year in terms the document

marked P-4. Accordingly, to my mind, the 4th Respondent has not

furnished any valid proof before Court to establish the fact that the

said garage had been in operation prior to the year 2008.

As stated earlier, what is also to be taken note of, is that, while the 5th

to 7th Respondents concurring with the Petitioners contention that

the said garage operates in a Residential Zone, in their written

submission dated 14.01.2019, they state the reasons for granting an

EPL to the 4th Respondent in the year of 2015 as follows:

18. It is respectfully submit that along with the document marked P-22, the report of inquiry held by the 1st Respondent on 25.05.2015 was produced, where an officer representing the 8th Respondent, Mr. Kulatunga misrepresenting the facts has stated that it was a mixed residential zone and that 7th Respondent has approved Plan for a garage in year 2005 whereas its not so the approval had obtained for residence as evident on the face of the document marked P-16A. 19. It is respectfully submitted to Your Lordships that Garage Premise is situated in a residential area as stated in P-20 and colored marking on the Zonal Map. EPL P-15 was issued by the 7th Respondent Local Authority taking into consideration of the fact that it was situated in a mix residential area basing the Report prepared by the Inspection team which was submitted to Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) which compromises of an officer of CEA who function as the Secretary to TEC and based on TEC recommendation and the directions in P-14.

Considering the above, it is clear that the said EPL, P-15 has been

issued to the 4th Respondent based on alleged misrepresentative

founding of the Technical Evaluation Committee of the 1st

Respondent. Accordingly, this Court is of the considered view that the

said EPL, P-15 has been issued contrary to the National

Environmental Act, No. 47 of 1980 for the reason that the said garage

is situated in a Residential Area contrary to the Zoning Plan P-21.

Page 12 of 12

In the circumstances, I take the view that this petition should be

allowed.

Accordingly, I issue both the writs of certiorari and mandamus sought

by the Petitioner as prayed for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of the prayer

to the petition. No costs.

Application allowed.
