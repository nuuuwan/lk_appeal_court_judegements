ORDER The Petitioner's company filed this application on 08th December 2015 in terms of Article 140

of the constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, seeking a mandate in the

nature of writs of certiorari and a prohibition against the Respondents. In October 2016, the

Respondents' objections were tended, and the counter objections were filed in May 2017, and

the matter was fixed for argument. However, before taking up for argument, the Petitioner

filed a motion dated 1.10.2018 with an affidavit and documents marked X1 X5.

Page 3 of 6

On 29th July 2020, the Petitioner supported his application made on 1.1.2018 to tender the

affidavit and documents marked X1 X5. The Respondents objected to this application, and

the Senior Deputy Solicitor General moved for a ruling regarding the affidavit and documents

tendered on 01..10.2018 before taking the matter for argument. Both parties agreed to tender

written objections. Accordingly, both parties filed objections and counter objections, and this

order is in respect of the affidavit and documents filed on 01.10.2018.

In perusing the affidavit of 01.10.2018, it is filed by the Executive Director of the petitioner

company. The respondents have demanded money from the Petitioner regarding consignments

of crude palm fatty acid imported by the Petitioner from February 2012 to September 2013.

This import was done under the H.S. code 3823.19.90 as per the classification ruling issued by

the D Branch of the Sri Lanka Customs. However, that ruling by the D Branch was

subsequently revised by the Nomenclature Committee of the Sri Lanka Customs on 27.6.2014,

classifying the consignment under H.S. code 1518.00. Therefore, demand for money, which is

the subject matter of this case, was made on the classification ruling made by the Nomenclature

Committee, which was non-existent when the consignment was imported during the period

28.2.2012- 23.9.2013.

Therefore, the actual ruling should be the D Branch ruling classifying the product under H.S.

Code 3823 and not 1518. the X1-X4 documents are true copies of Customs case No.

PREV/114/2016. The inquiry was in respect of a consignment alleging that the product crude

palm fatty acid imported by the Petitioner was, in fact, contaminated palm oil.

X1 Proceedings of 1.8.2017

X2 Proceedings of 27.10.2017

X3 Inquiring officers order dated 12.7.2018 exonerating the Petitioner.

X4 Decision of the Sri Lanka Customs to classify the product under 3824.99 according to

the classification ruling of the world customs organisation produced at the inquiry as P55.

X5 A document of the tariff guide for HS 3824

By the affidavit, the Petitioner had claimed under Section 18 of Customs Ordinance for money

overpaid by Petitioner to be refunded.

The respondents objecting to this affidavit and documents argue that the customs inquiring

disclosed by the Petitioner has no bearing on the present case. The inquiry was held in custom

case No PREV/114/2016 was in respect of six different consignments imported by the

Petitioner in 2016. In the writ Application No. 158/2016, the court of appeal has already

Page 4 of 6

reached a final determination regarding the six consignments based on custom inquiry case

NO. PREV /114/2016, which is still in force.

The respondents point out the issue on the custom inquiry No. PREV/114/2016 was for an

importation of prohibited substance that is too harmful to human health in 2016, and the issue

of the present case is a short levy for consignments imported in 2012 2013 upon a

classification dispute.

Objecting to the application, the respondents state that the Petitioner had suppressed necessary

materials he had failed to inform the court regarding the C.A. writ application NO 158/2016

on the 6th February 2016 the court of appeal pronounced its judgement in case No 158/2016

and pronounced the following among other findings.

a) The substance contained in the detained six shipments cannot be categorised as

"crude Palm Fatty Acid."

b) That the analyses reports indicate that they could be adulterated palm oil;

c) That it is not possible to conclude that the Petitioner had been importing the

identical substance at all times, and

d) According to the analysis reports, this substance has been identified as palm oil,

the importation of that substance in its present form is a violation of law, and

hence releasing such substance to the Petitioner would also be a violation of the

law.

Therefore the Petitioner's application to file amended papers is based on incorrect and irrelevant

facts. In replying to objections by the Respondents, the Petitioner has filed his position on 02nd

December 2020. Petitioner had not tried to amend the original petition but only to bring in

additional evidence. The Petitioner is not agitating to canvas the judgment of C.A. writ

application 158/2016. He had filed S.C./5PL/LA/29/2017 against the decision of C.A. writ

application 158/2016. However, the supreme court case was settled between parties. According

to the settlement, parties agreed to hold an inquiry according to law. After that, the custom

inquiry PREV/114/2016 was held.

By X9, a schedule of all Petitioner's shipments of the produced crude Palm Fatty Acid from

November 2012 to April 2016 was shown. The Petitioner stated that the schedule included

shipments of the present case and the shipments for the period 2012-2016.

After going through all the documents and submissions, I find that X9 contains consignments

of Crude Palm Fatty Acid as follows.

The above tallies with dates and registered number of the customs inquiry No

PCAD/14Q0/051/2013/CCR/4339. P27, also marked as R(A), judgment dated 06.02 2017does

did not speak of any consignments during 2012 2013. It has been confined to six

consignments in 2016. When the writ application No 158/2016 was filed, the Petitioner was

aware of the present case but opted to remain silent because the cause of action is different.

Likewise, the contains of the consignments are also different. The consignment, in this case,

has no bearing on the consignments of the other case. Therefore, it is my view that the affidavit

and documents X1- X5 will have no bearing on the present case.

Therefore, the documents X1 X5 and the affidavit filed by the Petitioner on 1.10.2018 will

not be accepted for this case.
