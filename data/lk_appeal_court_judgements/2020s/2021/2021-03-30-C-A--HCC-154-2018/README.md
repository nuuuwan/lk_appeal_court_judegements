Counsel : Neranjan Jayasinghe for the Accused-Appellant Suharshi Herath, SSC for the State Written : 07.03.2019(by the Accused-Appellant) Submissions on 30.04.2019(by the Respondent) Argued On : 17.02.2021 Decided On : 30.03.2021 ******************** Devika Abeyratne,J

The Accused-Appellant in this case was convicted for the murder of one

Alankara Devage Ajith Rohana and sentenced to death. He was also convicted for

causing grievous injuries in the same transaction to Hegalla Dewage Wijesundara and

Kanduboda Dewage Nirosh Sampath Jayaweera offences punishable under section

317 of the Penal Code and was sentenced on each count to a term of one year rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1000/- each and in default, 2 weeks simple imprisonment.

This appeal is against the said convictions and the sentences.

The prosecution case according to witnesses PW 1 and PW 2 who are the injured

persons in count two and three is as follows. PW 1 and PW 2 together with the deceased

had gone to Podi Chandis house around 7.30 pm on 30.07.1996. According to PW 01

it was to collect a trouser material and according to PW 2 it was to pay for a trouser.

When they were close to Piyasiri Mudalalis house the appellant, who was hiding

behind a flower bush had suddenly come out and stabbed PW 1 and PW 2 and was seen

chasing the deceased Ajith Rohana who had started to run.

3

PW 1 had walked to PW 3 Asilins house which is closeby. Asilin is the grand

mother of the deceased. He had informed Asilin that the accused appellant was seen

chasing after Ajith Rohana, after stabbing PW 2 and him. She had accompanied him

to report the incident to the Police. Thereafter, PW 1 had been taken to the

Wathupitiwala Hospital by the Police.

According to PW 2 he has not seen anyone stabbing him, only a sudden pain in

his back, and then felt blood on his hand. He had seen a tall person chasing after Ajith

Rohana. He had lost consciousness and when he was regaining consciousness he had

identified the appellant walking back with something like an iron rod in his hand.

Thereafter, PW 2 also had gone to Asilins house and had informed about Karune

(appellant) attacking him and to check on the deceased who was chased by the

appellant. PW 1 had been at Asilins house when he went there. Although he was

injured, he has not accompanied PW 1 to the hospital. No reason was given as to why

he did not go to hospital that night.

One would expect PW 2 to be rushed to the closest hospital at the earliest

opportunity if he was seriously injured. This begs the question whether PW 2s injury

was of a grievous nature. This fact will be addressed later in the judgment. It is PW 2

who has shown the place of incident to the police the following morning. He had been

dispatched to the Wathupitiwala hospital by the police, which further established that

he has not gone to the hospital on his own accord.

The appellant was known to both PW 1 and PW 2. They have identified him by

moon light. It was specifically stated that they speak with each other and there was no

animosity or ill feeling existed between them . Both prosecution witnesses have

evidenced that they are unaware of the reason for the sudden attack. PW 02 has in fact

obtained the services of the appellant who was a tailor.

4

There is no direct evidence as to how Ajith Rohana came to his death. Only the

evidence of PW 1 that he saw the appellant chasing him. PW 2 has seen a tall man

chasing the deceased. He has seen the appellant later coming back with an iron rod in

his hand. The deceased had only a stab injury.

The version of the accused who gave evidence under oath is that when he was

returning from the after borrowing some money from one Gamini to pay the

Baas who was constructing his house, near the tomb of Podi Hamine ,four bare bodied

people with clubs had attacked him. In self defence he had brandished the knife he was

carrying to ward off the blows. He admitted that he may have injured the people who

were assaulting him when he was waiving the knife. The reason given for carrying the

knife was to cut arecanuts and also for his protection specially in the night.

He has also testified of having been robbed on an earlier occasion and that it

was dangerous to be on the road at night in this village. He had admitted consuming

liquor on that night. It was his evidence that although he did not know their names, he

recognized PW 1, PW2 and the deceased, as the persons who attacked him and then

disappeared, when he was waving the knife.

In cross examination at page 271 of the brief, he has admitted that they may have

got injured when he was brandishing the knife. Although he had mentioned there were

four people who assaulted him with clubs, he had identified only the three referred to

above. He had got admitted to the Wathupitiwala hospital. He has stated that although

there were no visible signs of any wound, there were contusions from the assault with

the clubs. He has testified that the police also assaulted him to such a degree, he had

admitted to all what was suggested by the police and also admitted that he did not

inform the learned Magistrate about the assault by the police.

5

His unwavering evidence has been that the incident happened near the tomb of

Podi Hamine and not near Piyasiri mudalalis house as stated by the prosecution

witnesses and that the tomb is about 50 to 60 meters from the bushes near the house of

Piyasiri mudalali.

It is interesting to note that the investigating police officer PW 6 has also testified

that the body of the deceased was found about 55 meters away from the bushes ()

which according to PW 2 is the place of incident. There had been blood stains near the

bushes. If what PW 1 and PW 2 are saying is correct, the blood cannot be from the

deceased as their testimony is they witnessed the deceased running with the appellant

behind him.

If the appellants version is correct and when the distance to where the body of

the deceased was found is considered, the altercation may have happened near the

tomb.

The learned trial judge has stated at page 26 of the judgment that the accused

appellant had admitted stabbing with the knife that was recovered pursuant to the

section 27 statement which may have caused injury to PW 1, PW 2 and the deceased.

However, goes on to state that the injuries are such that they could not have been caused

by the appellant just brandishing the knife, therefore, the version of the appellant is not

probable.

The testimony of the accused appellant is that when he was confronted by four

people assaulting him with clubs from the front and the back, he had brandished the

knife in all directions, trying to save himself. In a frenzied attack of that nature, one

cannot exactly pinpoint where the knife is going to strike. It appears that the learned

trial judge has not considered that possibility.

6

According to the accused appellant he had been warded at the Wathupitiwala

hospital and the police had come around 10 pm and stood guard over him throughout

the night. After informing about the death of the deceased the following morning, the

police had got him discharged from the hospital and taken him to the Nittambuwa

Police Station. The fact that the accused appellant was in hospital is corroborated by the

evidence of PW 6, although a medical report was not submitted.

The learned judge commenting about the non-availability of a medical report has

cast the burden on the accused appellant.

In Lakshami Singh vs State of Bihar AIR 1976 SC 2263 the Indian Supreme

Court had held:

In a murder case the non explanation of the injuries sustained

by the accused at about the time of occurrence or in the course of the

altercation is a very important circumstance from which the court can

draw the following inferences:(1) That the prosecution has

suppressed the genesis and the origin of the occurrence and has thus

not presented the true version; (2) That the witnesses who have denied

the presence of the injuries on the person of the accused are Lying in

a most material point and therefore their evidence is unreliable;

In the instant case it was observed that the investigating officer PW 6 had

reluctantly admitted in page 251 of the brief that it transpired that the appellant had been

admitted to hospital. The evidence of the appellant was that the police stood guard over

him at the hospital. It cannot be said that the chief investigating officer was unaware of

such a situation, which shows that the prosecution has attempted to suppress certain

important facts from the trial court. Not submitting the medical report of the appellant

can be considered as one suppression of a material fact in that sense.

7

The Investigating Officer SI Rupasinghe PW 6 , further testified that the body

of the deceased was found about 55 meters away from the alleged place of incident

where PW 1 and PW 2 were stabbed as shown by PW 2. This witness had recovered the

knife on a section 27 statement from a sandpit in the appellants garden.

The post mortem had been conducted by PW 10 at the scene of the crime and

there had been only one stab injury under the arm pit on the left side of the body. The

medical experts opinion was that the injury would have been caused by using severe

force. Further, he had opined that the weapon has to be a knife with a point and the

blade of the knife should be approximately six inches long. According to him with the

injury that was caused there was no way the life of the deceased could have been saved.

The knife purported to have been recovered pursuant to a Section 27 recovery,

according to PW 10 could have caused the injury to the deceased and injured PW 1 and

PW 2.

PW 1 had one injury on the left forearm near the armpit and in the history given

to the medical officer he had stated that the accused stabbed him. He had been

discharged on the 02.08.1996. PW 02 who was admitted around 09.15 am on

31.07.1996 too had been discharged on the 02.08.1996 and had also informed the doctor

that the accused stabbed him on the left shoulder at the scapula.

The injury to PW 2 is one inch wide and half an inch deep stab injury on the left

shoulder at the back of the chest, with no damage to internal organs. It had been

catergorised as a grievous injury. (P 4). The injury to PW 1 is a one inch wide half an

inch deep stab injury on left upper arm also catergorised as a grievous injury.(P 3). It is

PW 10 who has prepared all three reports. It is noted, specifically in pages 224, 225

,227 and 228 of the brief that the injuries sustained by PW 1 and PW 2 are superficial.

When considering the evidence of PW 10 together with P3 and P4 reports, it is

apparent that the seriousness of the injuries has not been sufficiently elicited in the

evidence. The medical evidence is that the stab wounds are superficial. Then the

question arises how the injuries were catergorised as grievous. PW 2 not attending the

hospital until the following morning, for approximately 12 hours, also has to be

considered in this background. No explanation was forthcoming. The medical officer

had been questioned whether PW 1 and PW 2 were under influence of liquor at the time

of incident. The answer was that P3 and P4 reports were prepared at the time of

discharge which was about 3 days later, therefore, that information will not reflect in

the report.

In this regard it seems that the prosecuting counsel and the learned trial judge

have failed in their duty to get a proper evaluation of the injuries that were caused to

PW 1 and PW 2, considering the medical witness himself admitting that the injuries are

superficial. () .

It is obvious that PW 10 has not been questioned the basis for his medical

experts opinion that PW 1 and PW 2 have suffered grievous injuries. As stated above

PW 2 had not even attempted to go to a hospital until the Police took him there. He had

been fit enough to show the purported place of incident the following morning.

Section 45 of the Evidence Ordinance merely states that the expert opinion is

relevant- Not conclusive. ( emphasis added) .

10

It was held in Ranjit Wijesiri alias Wije vs The Attorney General CA No 64/96

decided on 11.03.1999 by Ninian Jayasuriya J.

Where a Judge or Jury is called upon to decide such a difficult question

of science, there must be questioning of the medical expert in detail in

regard to the media, grounds and reasons for his opinion, to enable the

Judge to educate himself with sufficient knowledge to decide that issue

independently of experts opinion but assisted by the expert. Where they

fail to do so, then the Judge would be permitting the expert to usurp his

functions and the Judge would also be wrongly delegating his judicial

functions to the expert. "

On examination of medical reports marked as P3 and P4 and the oral testimony

of PW 10 and the manner in which PW 2 has acted after receiving the purported

grievous injuries, it is my considered view that the opinion of PW 10 with regard to the

injuries of PW 1 and PW 2 are not conclusive. Therefore, a doubt has arisen about the

seriousness of the injuries of PW 1 and PW 2.

According to PW 10 who inspected the body at the scene, the cause of death is

shock due to bleeding from heart due to a stab injury. In my opinion the deceased had

been under the influence of liquor.

The deceased who was 14 years of age at that time had been under the influence

of liquor and the doctor in his evidence in page 231 has stated as follows;

:

. ?

:

: ?

11

: . 14 .

.

With the medical evidence it is established that the 14 year old deceased was

under the influence of liquor at the time of incident .A reasonable doubt has been created

in my mind whether the reluctance of the then 17 year old PW 2 to seek medical help

that night was due to the fact that he too was under the influence of liquor.

The basis for this is both PW1 and PW2 stating that there was no animosity or

ill will between them and they cannot fathom the reason for the sudden attack.

There was no evidence elicited why the appellant who was getting back home to

pay the baas should be hiding behind a bush waiting to confront the prosecution

witnesses and the deceased. There is also no evidence that the appellant had reason to

believe that these three people were coming on the road at that particular time.

On the other hand the appellants version is that he was taken by surprise being

confronted by four bare bodied people who assaulted him near a tomb in moonlight.

Both PW 1 and PW 2 have not witnessed Ajith Rohana being attacked. In the

light of the available material before the trial court there was no evidence to reach a

conclusion that the appellant chased after Ajith Rohana with an intention to kill him.

It is to be considered that according to the accused he was under attack with

clubs which was an unforeseen situation. As stated earlier, the deceased and the

prosecution witnesses were with clubs and were bare bodied. It is also established by

medical evidence that the 14 year old deceased was under the influence of liquor, which

12

is not usual behaviour expected of a boy of that age. In such a circumstance, it is difficult

to predict the behaviour of such a person.

The testimony of PW 1 and PW 2 corroborates on some points. However, when

the evidence of the accused is considered, he has admitted the brandishing of the knife

and that he may have caused some injury trying to defend himself. On a perusal of

evidence there is no proof beyond reasonable doubt established by the prosecution, that

the accused had the intention of causing injuries which in the ordinary course of nature

were sufficient to cause death. There is a distinction between an intention to inflict

injuries which are only likely to cause death and injuries which are sufficient to cause

death, as explained in Ranjit Wijesiri alias Wije vs The Attorney General (Supra).

When considering the evidence in totality of how the incident had occurred, it

is apparent that there was no animosity or ill will existing between the parties and that

there was no motive as such to deliberately cause injury to PW 1, PW 2 and the

deceased.

The learned Counsel for the State in her written submissions and also at the

argument submitted that the injury suffered by the deceased is the left lung and the heart

being pierced by a pointed weapon which could have been caused by the weapon

identified by the doctor, and that the murderous intention of the accused is established

by the attendant circumstances.

It appears that at the trial court the defence has not raised a plea of sudden fight.

In this connection I am guided by the following judicial decisions.

13

In King VS Albert Appuhamy 41 NLR page 505 wherein the Court of Criminal

Appeal held thus:

Failure on the part of prisoner or his Counsel to take up a

certain line of defence does not relieve a Judge of the responsibility of

putting to the jury such defence if it arises on the evidence.

In King Vs. Vidanalage Lanty 42 NLR page 317- Court of Criminal Appeal

observes thus;

There was evidence in this case upon which it was open to

jury to say that it came within exception 4 to section 294 of the Penal

Code and that the appellant was guilty of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder. No such plea, however, was put forward on his

behalf.

Held, that it was the duty of the presiding Judge to have so

directed the jury and that in the circumstances that appellant was

entitled to have the benefit of the lesser verdict.II

In King Vs. Bellana Vithanage Eddin 41 NLR page 345- Court of Criminal

Appeal observes thus:

In a charge of murder it is the duty of the Judge to put to

the jury the alternative of finding. The accused guilty of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder when there is any basis for such a

finding in the evidence an record, although such defence was not

raised nor relied upon by the accused.

14

As stated earlier in this judgment, the accused appellant has unequivocally

admitted brandishing his knife in self defence in a sudden attack and accepts that he

may have accidentally injured PW 1, PW 2 and caused injury that caused the death of

the deceased.

It is well settled law that there is a distinction between an intention to inflict

injuries which are only likely to cause death and injuries which are sufficient to cause

death. Proof beyond reasonable doubt of a very high degree of probability of the act of

causing death is required to be established by the prosecution. When considering the

totality of the evidence led in this case, it is apparent that the learned trial judge has not

given his mind to this distinction.

Ninian Jayasuriya J in Ranjit Wijesiri alias Wije vs The Attorney General ( supra) has

stated that Gratien J has observed in King Vs. Mendis 54 NLR page 177 if there is

doubt or deficiency of the part of the prosecution, that doubt must be resolved in favour

of the accused and one must in such circumstances arrive at a finding of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder.

In page 180 in King Vs. Mendis it goes on to say There remains for

consideration, however, the more difficult question whether the convictions for murder

were justified upon the evidence. In the facts of the present case, this depends on

whether there was evidence upon which the jury, properly directed, could reasonably

hold that the act of the appellants which caused the death of Vincent Silva. was also

from its very nature sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. These

words in clause 3 of the definition of murder contained in section 294 of the Penal

Code require that the-probability of death ensuing from the injury inflicted was not

merely likely but very great, though not necessarily inevitable. In re Singaram

Padayachi and others [A.I.R: 1944) Mad. 223.]. If, on the other hand, the evidence

establishes that there was probability in a lesser degree of death ensuing from the act

15

committed, the finding should be that the accused intended to cause an injury likely to

cause death and the conviction should be culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

Ratanlals Law of Crimes (16th edition), page 705.

Considering the totality of the evidence adduced in this case, I am of the view

that the accused is guilty of the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder

on the basis of intention to inflict injuries which are likely to cause death.

Accordingly, we set aside the findings and conviction for the offence of murder

imposed by the trial judge and we find the accused appellant guilty of the offence of

culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of intention, an offence

punishable under Section 297 of the Penal Code We set aside the sentence of death

imposed by the trial judge.

We take into consideration the facts borne out by the record, for instance that on

18.01.2008, 21.04.2010, 29.10.2010, and 14.11. 2011, the counsel for the accused had

made application to consider the lesser culpability of the accused on the basis of sudden

fight. At each application, the Prosecuting Counsel had obtained dates to consider the

application but nothing had come to fruition. It is very unfortunate that the Honorable

Attorney General has taken approximately 4 years to give his opinion to the request to

consider the culpability of the appellant to a lesser offence.

We therefore sentence the accused to a term of eight years rigorous

imprisonment. But as the accused has been convicted on 12.10.2018 and still in remand

after conviction till the disposal of the appeal, we order that the term of eight years

rigorous imprisonment will take effect and be operative from 12.10.2018. The

conviction, finding and sentence of death imposed by the trial judge is set aside.

16

The conviction, finding and sentence with regard to count two and three to stand

unchanged and the one year rigorous imprisonment for those two counts will take effect

and be operative from 12.10.2018 and run concurrently. The appeal is partly allowed.

The registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment together with the original

case record to the High Court of Gampaha.
