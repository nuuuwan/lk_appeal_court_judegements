The appellant was convicted for the first and second counts and

sentenced to life imprisonment. Being aggrieved by the conviction and

the sentence, the appellant has preferred this appeal.

The incident happened in the Maligawatta Magistrates Court premises

when the prisoners were brought to that Court and when they were

getting into the bus to go back to the prison. The prisoners had to walk

between the people who had come to the Court premises. PW2 had felt

suspicion about the appellant and when checking him, he passed a small

parcel to the second accused who was standing behind him. PW2 had

taken the parcel containing heroin. PW2 had informed the Police Post of

the Court. Then two suspects and the parcel were taken to the Police

Narcotics Bureau and weighed the parcels and sealed the substance.

PW2 has given evidence to the effect of the both accused were checked

before they had left prison and when they were checked at the Court

premises, they did not have the parcel.

Officers of the Government Analyst had identified 3.05 grams of heroin

from the substance. The parcel of heroin was taken into custody from

the accused persons by PW2. He then had handed it over to PW1, the

OIC of the Maligakanda Police Post. The sealed productions were

handed over to the production keeper of Magistrates Court Police Post.

Thereafter the same was handed over to Government Analyst. The

inward journey of this case had been proved by the prosecution

witnesses. This was not challenged by the defence in this regard. Since

the Trial Judge had heard all the evidence of this case, he had the

opportunity to see the demeanor and deportment of all the witnesses.

There was no reason for the PW1 or PW2 to implicate the appellant

falsely. There was no such suggestion to the witnesses.

In the appeal, the only point argued on behalf of the appellant was that

the learned Trial Judge had stated in his judgment that the stance taken

by the appellant was not suggested to the witnesses. It is incorrect. The

learned Senior State Counsel conceded this fact. However, she pointed

out that there was over whelming evidence to prove the prosecution case.

The position taken up by the appellant was put to PW2 and he had

denied it. The evidence of PW2 stands un-contradicted. Incorrect

statement in the judgment had not prejudiced the right of the appellant.

The prosecution had proved the charges against the appellant beyond

reasonable doubt.

Proviso to the Section 334 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code states as

follows:

334(1). The Court of Appeal on any appeal against conviction on a

verdict of a jury shall allow the appeal if it thinks that such verdict

should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or

cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, or that the

judgment of the court before which the appellant was convicted

should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision of any

question of any law or that on any ground there was a miscarriage

of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal:

Provided that the Court may notwithstanding its opinion that the

point raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the

Appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial

miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

This provision applied to the non-jury cases as well.

In the case of Mannar Mannan Vs. Republic of Sri Lanka [1990] 1 Sri LR.

280, the Supreme Court held that the question to be asked by the

Judges themselves is whether on the evidence a reasonable jury,

properly directed on the standard of proof, would without doubt have

convicted the appellant?

In M.H.M Lafeer V. The Queen 74 N.L.R 246 His Lordship Justice

H.N.G.Fernando held thus:-

There was thus both misdirection and non-direction on matters

concerning the standard of proof. Nevertheless, we are of opinion having

regard to the cogent and un contradicted evidence that a Jury properly

directed could not have reasonably returned a more favourable verdict.

We therefore affirm the conviction and sentence and dismiss the appeal."

It is not the contention of the appellant that the conviction was

unreasonable, or that it cannot be supported having regard to the

evidence. In this case, the evidence is cogent, convincing and sufficient to

support the conviction. Therefore, the incorrect statement made by the

Trial Judge had not occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

In the above circumstances, there is no reason for this Court to interfere

with the judgment of the learned Trial Judge. I affirm the conviction and

sentence. The appeal is dismissed.

I agree.
