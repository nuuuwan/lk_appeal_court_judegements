The Petitioner has filed this application seeking inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to quash

the Quit Notice marked X8 served on him by the 1st Respondent, the Competent

Authority in terms of Section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7

of 1979, as amended (the Act).

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner states that his father, Davith Fernando came into possession of the

land described in the First Schedule to the petition in 1923 and that he continued to

be in possession of the said land until his death in 1970. The Petitioner states further

that his father transferred the aforementioned land to Richard Fernando, the elder

brother of the Petitioner by Deed of Transfer No. 3112 dated 7th September 1966,

marked X3. I have examined X3 and observe that while details of any prior

registration have not been specified, it acknowledges that Davith Fernando has held

3

and possessed the said land for over twenty years. The extent of the land referred to

therein is about half an acre and the boundaries given in X3 are as follows:

NorthWire fence separating the portion from Ragala Estates Superintendants

Bungalow

East V.C. Road leading to Uva Paranagama

SouthBarbed wire fence separating the land from Ragala Estate

West No. 17, Tea Field belonging to Upper Division of Ragala Estate

It would thus be seen that the Superintendants bungalow was situated on the

northern boundary of the said land possessed by Davith Fernando.

The Petitioner states that his brother, Richard Fernando transferred the ownership of

the said land to him by Deed of Gift No. 113 dated 2nd February 1985, marked X4.

The extent of the land and the boundaries are the same as X3. The Petitioner states

that he transferred 35 perches out of the said land to his two sisters by Deed of Gift

No. 707 dated 5th January 1995, marked X5. The land transferred by the Petitioner

to his two sisters has been depicted as Lot No. 2 of Plan No. 3904, while the extent of

land that the Petitioner retained has been depicted as Lot No. 1.

It is admitted that the land occupied by the Petitioner is surrounded on three sides

by Ragala Estate. It is the position of the Respondents that the land occupied by the

Petitioner too is part of the Ragala Estate. The Respondents state that Ragala Estate

including Halgran Oya Division vested in the 4th Respondent, the Land Reform

Commission under the provisions of the Land Reform Law No. 1 of 1972, as amended

(the LRC Law). The Statutory Declaration made by the owner of the Ragala Group is

marked 4R1.

In terms of an Order made by the Minister of Agriculture under Section 27A(1) of the

LRC Law and published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 183/10 dated 12th March 1982

marked R1, the Ragala Group including Halgran Oya division had been vested with

the Janatha Estates Development Board (the JEDB), a Corporation established under

the State Agricultural Corporations Act No. 11 of 1972. In terms of Section 27A(2) of

the LRC Law, an Order under Section 27A(1) shall have the effect of vesting in the

JEDB such right, title and interest to the agricultural land or estate land or portion

4

thereof described in that Order, as was held by the Commission on the day

immediately preceding the date on which the Order takes effect. Thus, title in the

Ragala Estate is now with the JEDB

By an Order made under Section 2(2) of the Conversion of Public Corporations or

Government Owned Business Undertakings into Public Companies Act No. 23 of 1987

(as amended), published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 720/2 dated 22nd June 1992,

marked 5R2, the 5th Respondent, Mathurata Plantations Limited had been

incorporated to take over the functions and carry on the business of the parts of the

JEDB specified therein, including the Ragala Estate and St Leonards Estate.

The JEDB had thereafter executed an Indenture of Lease No. 763 dated 18th

November 1999 marked R2 in terms of which it had leased to the 5th Respondent

the land referred to therein, including the Ragala Estate and the Halgran Oya Estate,

in extent of approximately 1402A, for a period of 53 years.

Section 18 of the Act defines State Land as follows:

State land means land to which the State is lawfully entitled or which may be

disposed of by the State together with any building standing thereon, and with

all rights, interests and privileges attached or appertaining thereto, and

includes:

(b) land vested in or owned by under the control of

(i) the Land Reform Commission established by the Land Reform Law,

No.1 of 1972;

(ii) any corporate body established by or under ..... the State Agricultural

Corporations Act No. 11 of 1972, ...., as the case may be;

Thus, Ragala Estate falls within the definition of State Land [by virtue of b(ii)] for the

purposes of the Act.

The Petitioner admits that the land possessed by him is bounded by Ragala Estate

that is occupied by the 5th Respondent. The Petitioner states since 1999, there have

5

been periodic disputes between himself and the management of the 5th Respondent,

with regard to the ownership and possession of the land possessed by the Petitioner.

The Petitioner states that in July 1997, he instituted Case No. L/592 in the District

Court of Nuwara Eliya against the Superintendent of the 5th Respondent and the

predecessor of the 1st Respondent, seeking inter alia a declaration of title in respect

of the aforementioned land possessed by the Petitioner. By way of a Claim in

Reconvention, as contained in the amended answer of the 1st and 2nd Defendants,

the defendants had prayed for an order to eject the Petitioner and/or anyone

holding under the Petitioner, from the land referred to in the 2nd Schedule to the

answer, which land is depicted in Plan No. 6151 and is in extent of 1R 19P. I must

note that as per the said Schedule, the northern boundary of the land from which

ejection of the Petitioner was sought is the Superintendents Bungalow, while the

eastern boundary of the said land is the road.

By a judgment dated 18th January 2011, the District Court dismissed the action of the

Petitioner and the claim in reconvention. The District Judge had observed that the

Petitioners father had claimed title to the said land described in the 1st schedule to

the plaint by virtue of long possession for over twenty years:

me2 Tmamqj ;=,ska ;yjqre jk lreKla jkqfha f;jk mdraYjhlf.ka meusKs,slrejka fj; foam, .ekSula fkdj oSra> ld,hl isg N=la;sh oerSu u; m<uq Wm f,aLKh.;

foam, iusnkaOfhka whs;sjdislus lshdmd we;s njg fjs.

However, in the absence of any evidence other than the Petitioners oral evidence as

to when the Petitioners father came into possession of the said land, and against

whom he took adverse possession of the land, the District Judge had concluded that

the fact that the Petitioners father had prescriptive title has not been proved before

the District Court. The position of the Petitioner that he had title to the said land by

virtue of the aforementioned deeds X3 and X4 has not been accepted by the

District Court.1 Therefore, due to the failure of the Petitioner to prove how his father

initially obtained title which he passed on to the Petitioners brother by virtue of X3,

the District Judge had dismissed the action of the Petitioner.

1 Vide page 15 of the judgment.

After the above action was dismissed, the 1st Respondent, the Officer of the Ministry

of Plantation Industries who had been designated the Competent Authority for the

purposes of the Act, had served the Petitioner with a Quit Notice dated 17th June

2011 marked X8 to hand over quiet and vacant possession of the above land

possessed by the Petitioner. Aggrieved by the decision to issue the said quit notice,

the Petitioner filed this application, seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash X8.

Before proceeding to consider the submissions on behalf of the Petitioner, it would

be useful to lay down, very briefly, the general framework of the Act, in order to

place in perspective the standard of review which Courts wish to adopt in reviewing

decisions taken under the Act.

The general objective of the Act has been discussed in Namunukula Plantations PLC

v. Nimal Punchihewa,2 where this Court held as follows:

"A competent authority can have recourse to the [State Lands (Recovery of

Possession)] Act to evict any person who is in unauthorized possession or

occupation of state land including possession or occupation by encroachment

upon state land. Any possession or occupation without 'a valid permit or other

written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law' is

unauthorized possession".

A strict regime has been put in place by the legislature in order to achieve the above

purpose of the Act and to ensure that possession of State land can be obtained

through an expeditious machinery without recourse to an ordinary civil action.3

The starting point of the said regime is Section 3 of the Act which reads as follows:

(1) Where a competent authority is of the opinion:

(a) that any land is State land; and

(b) that any person is in unauthorized possession or occupation of such

land, 2 CA (PHC) APN 29/2016; CA Minutes of 9th July 2018; per Janak De Silva J. 3 Ihalapathirana v. Bulankulame [1988] 1 Sri LR 416 at 420.

7

the competent authority may serve a notice on such person in possession

or occupation thereof, or where the competent authority considers such

service impracticable or inexpedient, exhibit such notice in a conspicuous

place in or upon that land requiring such person to vacate such land with

his dependents, if any, and to deliver vacant possession of such land to

such competent authority or other authorized person as may be specified

in the notice on or before a specified date. The date to be specified in such

notice shall be a date not less than thirty days from the date of the issue or

the exhibition of such notice.

(1A) No person shall be entitled to any hearing or to make any representation

in respect of a notice under subsection (1).4

(2) Every notice under subsection (1) issued in respect of any State land is in

this Act referred to as a quit notice.

(3) A quit notice in respect of any State land shall be deemed to have been

served on the person in possession or occupation thereof if such notice is

sent by registered post.

(4) Every quit notice shall be in Form A set out in the Schedule to this Act.

Section 3 of the Act is made up of several components. Firstly, prior to initiating the

process described under Section 3, the Competent Authority must form an opinion

that the land in question is State land, and that the person against whom the quit

notice is being issued is in unauthorized possession or occupation of such land.5 In

forming that opinion, the Competent Authority is not required to afford anyone a

hearing or conduct an inquiry.

In the event the person in possession fails to vacate such land and deliver vacant

possession, the Competent Authority shall be entitled in terms of Section 5 of the Act

to file an application for ejectment in the Magistrate's Court. The Magistrate is

thereafter required to issue summons in terms of Section 6 of the Act on the person

4 State Lands (Recovery of Possession) (Amendment) Act No. 29 of 1983. 5 Vide Section 18 of the Act

8

named in the said application to appear and to show cause as to why he should not

be ejected from the land as prayed for in the application for ejectment.

The scope of the Inquiry that is held by the Magistrate is narrow. While Section 9(2)

precludes the Magistrate from calling any evidence from the competent authority in

support of his application under Section 5, the defences that could be taken up by a

person against whom an application has been filed for ejectment are limited to those

set out in Section 9(1) of the Act, namely that he is in possession or occupation of the

land upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in

accordance with any written law and that such permit or authority is in force and not

revoked or otherwise rendered invalid. A person against whom an Order of

ejectment has been issued, has an opportunity to vindicate his/her title under

Section 12 of the Act.

Therefore, it is clear that the process which is triggered by the Competent Authoritys

opinion, leading to the issuance of the quit notice can have far reaching

consequences on one's proprietary rights and therefore must be placed under strict

scrutiny of Courts.6

I shall now consider the two principal arguments of the learned Presidents Counsel

for the Petitioner.

The first argument relates to the quit notice X8. In terms of Section 3(4), every quit

notice shall be in accordance with Form A of the Act, in terms of which the

Competent Authority is required to describe the land and state the situation of the

land in a schedule to the said quit notice.

The schedule to X8 reads as follows:

uOHu m,df;a kqjrt<sh osia;%slAlfha j,mfka m%dfoaYsh wdodhus ks<Odrs fldgsGdYfha

wfkl=;a iEu ish,qu foao fjs.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that it is important that

the quit notice is precise with regard to the extent and boundaries but that the quit

notice X8 does not contain an extent of land from which ejection is sought, nor is

there a reference to the land by way of a Survey Plan. It is the position of the

Petitioner that although the boundaries of the land have been given, the accuracy of

which I will advert to later, the extent of land that the Petitioner is in possession of

can be greater than what the State can have a claim to. The Petitioner states that the

words i;r udhsus ;=< msysgs bvus fldgi without any specification of the extent to

which the quit notice is intended to apply to, would give the 1st Respondent the

proverbial freedom of the wild horse to abuse his powers and take possession of all

extents of land within those four boundaries which he submitted would lead to an

abuse of due process and defeat the rule of law. The learned Additional Solicitor

General however submitted that right around the land possessed by the Petitioner is

the Ragala Estate and its divisions and that there is no difficulty in identifying the

land to which the quit notice relates to.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that a higher burden

must be placed on the Competent Authority to ensure that the corpus is properly

and precisely identified in view of the strict regime put in place by the Act. An

individual who is served with a quit notice can only present the limited defences

available to him in terms of the Act and does not have any means of challenging the

boundaries stated therein. Therefore, the Competent Authority must take the

responsibility of properly identifying the land the possession of which is sought to be

recovered.

The learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that all that Section 3(4) of the

Act requires is for the quit notice to be in accordance with Form A of the Schedule to

the Act, and that there is no requirement in Form A to annex a plan, specify metes

and bounds and to specify extents. He submitted further that in the absence of any

10

such requirement in the Act, it would be wrong for this Court to impose such a

requirement.

The learned Additional Solicitor General submitted further that the land in which the

Petitioner is in unlawful possession is situated on a corner of the Ragala Estate and is

bounded on three sides by the Estate and one side by the road and falls squarely

within the Ragala Estate. He submitted that in the absence of any other land:

(a) the entire land within the said boundaries is part of the Ragala Estate;

(b) it is not necessary to specify the extent of land from which ejection is sought;

(c) the specification of metes and bounds is irrelevant.

(d) it is not impractical to identify and take over possession of the land possessed

by the Petitioner.

The submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General is not without merit, given

the peculiar factual circumstances of this application that all other land surrounding

the land possessed by the Petitioner is land forming part of Ragala Estate. I must

however state that that does not negate the requirement in Form A which is to

describe the land stating the situation. The best way to describe a land is by referring

to a survey plan. Similarly, stating the situation of a land could be done by reference

to a survey plan. Furthermore, I am of the view that while at least an approximate

extent of the land must be specified where ejectment is sought from a large extent

of land, as in this application, where ejectment is sought from a land situated in an

Urban area, the extent of the land must be specified clearly.

The failure of the 1st Respondent to identify the land by reference to a survey plan

has given rise to the next submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner that in any event, the boundaries specified in X8 are wrong. There are

three survey plans relating to the impugned land that were produced before the

District Court. They are:

11

a) Plan No. 3904 dated 29th October 1994;7

b) Plan No. 4962 dated 28th November 2008;8

c) Plan No. 6151 dated 5th November 2010.9

Of the above three plans, Plan No. 4962 has been prepared pursuant to a

Commission issued by the District Court of Nuwara Eliya, while Plan No. 6151 has

been relied upon by the 1st Respondent to support the claim in reconvention before

the District Court. In each of the three plans, the Managers Bungalow is situated on

the northern boundary while the Road is situated on the eastern Boundary.

A comparison of the boundaries in the above three survey plans with the boundaries

of the quit notice in X8 is set out below:

Survey Plan Nos. 3904, 4962 and 6151 Quit Notice

NorthSuperintendants Bungalow St. Leonards Estate

East Road St. Leonards Estate

SouthRagala Estate Field No. 17 Superintendants

Bungalow

West No. 17, Tea Field - Upper Division of Ragala

Estate

Road

It is clear from the three Survey Plans, including the Survey Plan that was relied upon

by the 1st Respondent in the District Court to support the claim in reconvention, that

the Superintendents Bungalow is situated to the north of the land possessed by the

Petitioner. According to X8, the said bungalow is situated on the southern

boundary. The same position applies to the road, which is the eastern boundary on

each of the said survey plans but is situated on the western boundary in the quit

notice. It also appears that Ragala Estate and St Leonards Estate are two separate

estates.10 Thus, even though the quit notice X8 has described the land by reference

to boundaries, the boundaries are incorrect with the result that the situation of the

7 Vide page 187 of X7. 8 Vide page 173 of X7. 9 Vide page 171 of X7. 10 Vide R2.

12

land has not been correctly identified as required by Form A. I am therefore of the

view that X8 is not in conformity with the provisions of Form A and that the Quit

Notice is liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

I shall now consider the second argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner, which was raised during the course of the submissions, that the 1st

Respondent, in her capacity as the Plantation Supervising Officer of the Plantation

Management Supervision Unit of the Ministry of Plantation Industries cannot be

classified as a Competent Authority for the purposes of the Act.

Section 18 of the Act defines a competent authority as follows:

Competent Authority used in relation to any land means the Government

Agent, an Additional Government Agent or an Assistant Government Agent of

the district in which the land is situated and, includes ...... :

(l) an officer generally or specially authorized by a corporate body, where

such land is vested in or owned by or under the control of, such corporate

body.

I have already adverted to the fact that Ragala Estate has been vested in the JEDB,

that title to the said estate is with the JEDB and to the fact that land vested in the

JEDB is State land for the purposes of the Act.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the said land has

been leased to the 5th Respondent and that there is no proof that the 5th Respondent

has authorised the 1st Respondent in any manner. In order to come within paragraph

(l) of the definition and be a competent authority for the purposes of the Act, what is

required is for the corporate body in whom the land is vested the JEDB in this case

to authorise the 1st Respondent. The fact that the land has been leased to the 5th

Respondent is therefore immaterial.

The Respondents have produced by motion dated 7th October 2019, a Board

Resolution of the JEDB dated 21st July 2009, appointing the 1st Respondent as the

Competent Authority for the purposes of the Act in respect of land vested in the

13

JEDB. As the 1st Respondent has been authorized by the JEDB to initiate action under

the Act, I am of the view that the 1st Respondent is entitled to function as the

Competent Authority for the purposes of the Act and that the 1st Respondent has the

power to issue the quit notice X8. I therefore do not see any merit in the second

submission on behalf of the Petitioner.

In the above circumstances, I issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the quit notice

marked X8. The Respondents may issue in terms of the Act, a fresh quit notice to

the Petitioner in respect of the land possessed by the Petitioner.

I make no order with regard to costs.
