Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the accused) filed this

appeal on being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence of him by the

learned High Court judge of Kuliyapitiya.

The accused was indicted before the High Court of Kuliyapitiya for causing

the death of one Muhandiramalage Sriyalatha on 23rd October 2013, an

offence punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, the learned High Court judge found the accused

guilty as charged by his judgment dated 14-11-2019, and was sentenced to

death accordingly.

At the hearing of the appeal the learned counsel for the accused relied on

the following grounds of appeal in her arguments before this Court.

(1) The learned trial judge has erred by relying upon suspicious

circumstances to form the basis of the convictions.

(2) Items of circumstantial evidence relied on by the learned trial judge

are wholly inadequate to come to an inference as to the guilt of the

Page 3 of 16

accused and the learned trial judge has failed to evaluate such

evidence in its correct judicial perspective.

(3) The learned trial judge has shifted the burden of proof to the

accused thereby reversing the presumption of innocence.

(4) Ellenborough principle has been misapplied.

(5) Application of last seen theory is erroneous.

(6) Dock statement of the accused has been rejected on an erroneous

premise causing serious prejudice to the accused.

The facts of the matter as revealed in the evidence briefly are as follows;

The deceased Sriyalatha was the mother-in-law of the accused whose wife

was employed in the Middle East at the time of the incident. The deceased

lived with her husband and other family members about 1 Km away from

the house of the accused, who lived with his two small school going

children. According to the evidence of PW-01, the husband of the deceased,

although he maintained no connection with the accused for over 12 years,

the deceased, obviously due to her maternal instincts, was in the habit of

visiting the house of the accused every evening in order to prepare meals for

the young children and look after their needs. She used to return home the

following day morning. On the day of the incident, PW-01 has received a

message saying that his wife has suffered injuries to her hand due to a fall

onto a crowbar that used to husk coconut ( ) and on his way to the

house of the accused PW-01 has received the message that his wife is no

more. It was the evidence of PW-01 that the accused has taken his wife to

Dambadeniya Hospital bypassing five hospitals, the nearest hospitals being

Katupotha or Narammala. It was his view that the accused took his wife to a

faraway hospital in order to make sure that she is dead.

There are no eye witnesses to the incident and this is a matter that has been

decided entirely on circumstantial evidence. At the trial, the stand of the

accused has been that there was no animosity between his mother-in-law

and himself and he found the deceased early morning of the day of the

Page 4 of 16

incident with injuries suffered due to her falling onto the coconut husking

crowbar which was outside the house.

The daughter of the accused who was about ten years old at the time of the

incident has testified that early morning of the day of the incident, she

heard a painful cry from her grandmother from outside the house and her

younger sister informed her that the grandmother has suffered an evil spirit.

Later she has seen her fallen near the coconut husking bar which was near

the house with blood on her body. She has also found the outside lights of

the house were on, and her father nearby. Her evidence reveals that it was

upon hearing her cry the neighbours have come to the scene.

PW-06 is a neighbour who has testified that at around 4.30 in the morning

on the day of the incident he heard a cry of a female and when he went to

the house of the accused to inquire, he found the deceased, and it was he

who accompanied the accused to take the deceased to a hospital in a van

belonging to another neighbour. He has stated in evidence that although it

was their intention to take the deceased to the Narammala hospital, which

was nearer, it was the accused who wanted the deceased to be taken to

Dambadeniya hospital. He has also stated that since the accused was the

relation of the deceased, they followed his instructions.

The evidence of PW-02 and PW-03, the daughters of the deceased who lived

some distance away and PW-07, the son who lived with the deceased, shed

some light into the relationship the deceased and her family members had

with the accused and the family life the accused maintained with his wife.

According to them, the accused was a person who used to ill-treat and

physically abuse his wife and the members of the wifes family did not

maintain a close relationship with the accused due to that fact. The

deceased, despite the objections of the family members was in the habit of

visiting the house of the accused after the departure of her daughter for

overseas employment in order to look after the children. The wife of the

accused had sent money to the mother and not to the accused and the

accused had been pressing the family members of the wife asking them to

Page 5 of 16

convince her to come back. It is also evidence that the accused gave a

telephone call to one of the daughters of the deceased (PW-03) and informed

her that he is planning to leave the country for employment on 25th October

and had said that he is going to conclude things before that. The deceased,

who met the PW-03 few days before the incident had informed her about the

harassment she has to face at the hand of the accused.

I find that all the witnesses called by the prosecution to testify as to the

incident and other surrounding circumstantial evidence have been cross

examined by the counsel for the accused at length. However, there are no

inconsistency inter say or per say in their evidence. The cross examination

has not created any doubt as to the trustworthiness or truthfulness of their

evidence either. Although the defence has cross examined the daughter of

the accused and established that one of her aunts coached her to implicate

the father at the Magistrate Court inquiry, she has been very much truthful

as to what she saw on the day of the incident when she gave evidence at the

High Court, which has not created any doubt as to the evidence of the other

witnesses.

Even though the defence has made an attempt to show that the deceased

had been suffering from various ailments at the time of her death, the

evidence led in the action shows that she was a person with no known

health issues.

I find that the evidence of PW-15, the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO), who

conducted the post-mortem on the deceased and PW-09, the Officer-in -

Charge of the Narammala Police on the day of the incident, who was the

main investigation officer, of paramount importance as this was a matter

decided mainly based on circumstantial evidence.

According to the evidence of the JMO, he has observed 14 injuries on the

body of the deceased. Injuries number 01 to 06 are stab wounds caused to

the stomach area of the deceased. He has opined that these wounds would

necessarily have to be caused by using force and cannot happen under

normal conditions like an accident. He has described the possible features of

Page 6 of 16

the weapon used and had identified the coconut husking crowbar marked as

P-03 as the possible weapon used.

The JMO has found several cut injuries and abrasions among the other

injuries. He was of the view that injuries 09, 12,13 and 14 are abrasions

that can happen as a result of dragging the victim while she was fallen face

up on the ground. It was also his view that the stab injuries have been

caused while the deceased was on the ground as no person can withstand

such number of injuries when standing. Apart from the injuries described in

detail, the JMO has also found contusions on the upper and lower inside

lips of the victim.

The evidence of the main investigation officer was that he received a

complaint from the accused that his wifes mother died as a result of

injuries she suffered from falling onto a coconut husking crowbar. He has

found the complaint questionable as the victim has been taken to the

Dambadeniya hospital about 23 Km away, bypassing several hospitals along

the way, including the Narammala hospital, which has resulted in him

commencing investigations immediately. He has reached the place of the

incident as directed by the accused and the accused had pointed the place

of the incident which was by the right side of the main door of the house

where a coconut husking crowbar was placed. He has observed that it has

been removed from the place where it was and on the ground. He has

observed further, that an unusual amount of water has been used in the

place of the incident and traces of blood on the crowbar and on the washed

ground, and had observed the well of the house far away from the place.

Upon questioning, the accused has explained the presence of water saying

that he washed the victims wounds before taking her to the hospital, which

was rather strange behaviour in a situation like this. The officer has

identified the crowbar he found near the place of the incident as the item

marked P-03. On further inquiry as to the surroundings of the house he has

excluded the possibility of someone coming from outside into the compound.

Investigating further, he has found a plastic bottle with kerosine nearby and

Page 7 of 16

upon inquiry the accused has explained that he used kerosine to clean the

rust marks of the crowbar and the injuries of the victim before she was

taken to the hospital. With all the highly suspicious circumstances in mind

the investigating officer has waited till the conclusion of the post mortem,

where the JMO has confirmed that the death was no accident as claimed,

but a crime.

I find that it was only after taking into consideration all the circumstantial

evidence the accused has been taken into custody by the investigating

officer after explaining the possible charge against him.

When called for a defence after the conclusion of the prosecution evidence,

the accused has made a statement from the dock where he has taken up the

position that on the day of the incident when he woke-up hearing a cry from

the deceased, he came out of the house with his youngest daughter who was

sleeping with him. And he saw the deceased fallen near the coconut husking

crowbar and found blood on the crowbar.

He has stated that after the neighbours came to the scene on hearing the

cries of the daughters, it was he who took the deceased to the hospital.

Explaining further, it was his position that he took her to the Dambadeniya

hospital believing that it has better facilities to treat the patient. He has also

admitted that he washed the deceased before she was taken to the hospital,

his explanation was that he did it in order to see what were the injuries

suffered by the deceased. Denying that he cleaned the wounds and the

crowbar with Kerosine oil he has explained that the Kerosine oil found was

brought by him to clean the water motor and the Police implicated him

wrongly.

Shifting away from the stand taken during witness for the prosecution gave

evidence that the deceaseds injuries are a result of her falling onto the

crowbar, the accused has stated that the crime would have been committed

by someone who came into the compound from outside. It has been his

stand that he was implicated in the crime by the relatives of the deceased

due to the animosities they had with him and he had no reason to harm his

Page 8 of 16

mother-in-law as she was the only person of the family who was in good

terms with him. The accused has called no other witnesses on behalf of him.

With the above facts in mind, I now proceed to consider the grounds of

appeal urged by the learned counsel for the accused.

The 1st ground of appeal where it was argued that the learned trial judge has

considered suspicious circumstances against him and the 2nd ground of

appeal where it was argued that the learned trial judge has considered

inadequate circumstantial evidence to find the accused guilty are

interrelated, hence, the two grounds of appeal will be considered together.

1st and the 2nd grounds of appeal: -

It is well settled law that suspicious circumstances against an accused in

itself does not establish guilt.

In the case of The Queen Vs. M.G. Sumanasena 66 NLR 350 it was held:

In a criminal case suspicious circumstances do not establish guilt. Nor

does the proof of any number of suspicious circumstances relieve the

prosecution of its burden of proving the case against the accused

beyond reasonable doubt and compel the accused to give or call

evidence

It is also well-established law that in order to prove a charge based on

circumstantial evidence, the evidence considered must point directly

towards the guilt of the accused and nothing more.

In the case of The King Vs. Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254 it was held:

Per Soertsz J.

In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the jury must

be satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the

accused and inconsistent with any reasonable hypotheses of his

innocence.

Page 9 of 16

In Don Sunny Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 01 it was held:

1) When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the

proved items of circumstantial evidence when taken together must

irresistibly point towards only inference that the accused committed

the offence. On consideration of all the evidence the only inference

that can be arrived at should be consistent with the guilt of the

accused only.

2) If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence, if an

inference can be drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the

accused, then one cannot say that the charges have been proved

beyond reasonable doubt.

3) If upon consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence

if the only inference that can be drawn is that the accused

committed the offence, then they can be found guilty. The

prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused had

the opportunity of committing the offence. The accused can be found

guilty only if the proved items of circumstantial evidence is

consistent with their guilt and inconsistent with their innocence.

Hence, it becomes necessary to consider whether the learned High Court

judge has considered the evidence in its correct perspective when he found

the accused guilty as charged.

I am unable to agree with the learned counsel for the accused that the

learned trial judge has failed to address his mind to the principles of law as

to suspicious circumstances and circumstantial evidence in its correct

perspective in the judgment. After considering the suspicious circumstances

that led to finger being pointed at the accused the learned trial judge has

considered the incriminating circumstantial evidence against the accused to

come to a firm finding before considering whether the accused has offered a

reasonable explanation on them.

Page 10 of 16

It is the accused who has made the first complaint claiming that his mother-

in- law suffered injuries due to her falling onto the coconut husking

crowbar. The accused had told the same thing to the son of the deceased

(PW-07) in his initial information as to what happened to the deceased.

When the neighbour PW-06 came to the place of the incident upon hearing

the cries of the daughters of the accused he has uttered the same statement

to him.

According to the accuseds own admission it was he who has seen the

deceased fallen onto the crowbar first. However, if it was so, as observed

correctly by the learned trial judge, it was he who should have raised the

alarm to seek help from the neighbours. However, it was only after the cry of

the elder daughter who came out of the house after hearing a painful cry

from her grandmother the neighbours have been alerted and had come for

help.

The accused had admitted that he washed the wounds of the deceased and

has explained his act, saying that it was done in order to inspect the injuries

suffered by the deceased. It is clear from the evidence that the accused has

done that before the arrival of the neighbours to the scene of the incident, as

the witnesses who came after they were alerted had not spoken about any

washing of the wounds of the deceased. There was no reason for the

accused to wash the wounds since if he saw the deceased fallen on the

crowbar as claimed by him.

The accused who took the mother-in-law to the hospital has chosen to take

her to a hospital situated 23 Km away, bypassing several other hospitals. I

find that this proven behaviour of the accused is not the behaviour of a

person faced with such a situation. Any such person would naturally alert

his neighbours as soon as he sees the injured person, and take steps

immediately to take the injured to the nearest hospital rather than washing

the wounds to inspect the injuries.

I find that these are not suspicious circumstances, but circumstantial

evidence that points directly towards the accused in view of the findings of

Page 11 of 16

the JMO in his post mortem examination and in view of the investigative

findings of the investigating officer, the then OIC of the Narammala Police.

The learned trial judge has considered the above-mentioned circumstantial

evidence in relation to the evidence of the JMO and the Police investigator to

come to a firm finding as to the evidence available, before considering

whether the accused has offered a reasonable explanation.

For the reasons stated as above, I find no basis for the grounds of appeal

considered.

As for the 3rd, 4th and the 6th grounds of appeal, where it was alleged that

the learned trial judge shifted the burden of proof to the accused

disregarding the presumption of innocence, the application of the

Ellenborough principle, and the argument that the learned trial judge has

failed to consider the dock statement of the accused in its correct

perspective are interrelated, I will now proceed to consider the same

together.

3rd, 4th and the 6th grounds of appeal: -

Although the learned counsel for the accused raised several grounds of

appeal, it was her main submission that the accused was deprived of a fair

trial as the learned High Court judge has shifted the burden of proof to the

accused.

She relied on the following passage of the judgment at page 20 of the

judgment (page 496 of the brief) to formulate the said argument.

.

If taken in its isolation, it appears that the learned trial judge has

misdirected himself as to the burden of proof of an accused in a criminal

trial as an accused person has no burden in a criminal trial. However,

Page 12 of 16

although the learned trial judge has used a wrong statement in the

paragraph, when reading the judgement in its totality, I am unable to agree

that the learned trial judge has shifted the burden of proof to the accused in

any manner than necessary to find whether the accused has given a

reasonable explanation as to the incriminating circumstantial evidence

against him.

In the case of Pantis Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 148 it was

held:

(1) The judge should have avoided using such language as the burden

of proof is always on the prosecution to prove its case beyond

reasonable doubt and no such duty cast on the accused and it is

sufficient for the accused to give an explanation which satisfies court

or at least is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.

(2) As the trial judge was a trained judge who would have been aware

the burden of proof was on the prosecution to prove its case beyond

reasonable doubt if a reasonable doubt was created in the mind as

to the guilt of the accused, he would have given the benefit of that

doubt to the accused and acquitted him.

(3) Further, misstatement has not prejudiced the substantial rights of

the parties or occasioned a failure of justice and there was ample

evidence to justify the conviction. (Emphasis is mine)

Similarly, it is my considered view that what is necessary to decide in this

appeal is whether the said statement has caused any prejudice to the

accuseds substantial rights and has occasioned a failure of justice.

It is very much apparent from the judgment that the learned High Court

judge has first considered and evaluated all the circumstantial evidence

available that points towards the accused, before deciding to consider the

provisions of section 106 of the Evidence Ordinance which has similar

provisions to the often-discussed Ellenborough dictum.

Page 13 of 16

Section 106 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows;

Section 106

When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person,

the burden of proving that fact is upon him.

The Supreme Court of India, considering the applicability of section 106 of

the Indian Evidence Ordinance, which is similar to section 106 of our

Ordinance, observed in the case of Shambhu Nath Mehra Vs. State of

Ajmer reported in AIR 1956 SC 404 that;

This lays down the general rule that in a criminal case the

burden of proof is on the prosecution and sec. 106 is certainly not

intended to relieve it of that duty. On the contrary, it is designed to meet

certain exceptional cases in which it would be impossible or at any rate

disproportionately difficult, for the prosecution to establish facts which

are especially within the knowledge of the accused and which he could

prove without difficulty or inconvenience. The word especially means

that. It means facts that are pre-eminently or exceptionally within his

knowledge. If the section were to be interpreted otherwise, it would lead

to the very startling conclusion that in a murder case the burden lies on

the accused to prove that he did not commit the murder because who

could know better than he whether he did or did not.

In deciding to apply the provisions of section 106 to the facts of the instant

action, the learned trial judge has considered the decided cases Sanitary

Inspector, Mirigama Vs, Thangamani Nadar 55 NLR 302 and Mohomed

Auf Vs. The Queen 69 NLR 337 where it stipulates that section 106 do not

cast a burden on an accused of proving a fact beyond the burden of the

prosecution to prove every ingredient of its case.

It is clear from the judgment at page 21, 22 and 23 (page 497, 498, and 499

of the brief) the learned trial judge has never looked beyond the expected

reasonable and acceptable explanation from the accused in considering his

defence.

Page 14 of 16

For matters of clarity, I would now reproduce the relevant final conclusions

of the learned trial judge at page 22 and 23 which reads thus;

.

.

.

.

.

2015.10.23

.

It is abundantly clear from the judgment that the learned trial judge has

reached his final conclusions not by shifting the burden of proof to the

accused as argued by the learned counsel for the accused, but by first

considering the evidence of the prosecution with the presumption of

innocence rule in mind. After well considering all the circumstantial

evidence placed before him and the totality of evidence, the learned trial

judge has considered whether the accused has created a reasonable doubt

Page 15 of 16

on the evidence of the prosecution or at least has given a reasonable

explanation as to the proven circumstantial evidence against him. I find that

it is only in that context the learned trial judge has considered the defence of

the accused, which cannot be interpreted in any manner that the learned

trial judge has failed to consider the accuseds dock statement in its correct

perspective.

At this juncture, I would like to reiterate what is stated in the case of Pantis

Vs. The Attorney General (Supra)

Further misstatement has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the

parties or occasioned a failure of justice and there was ample evidence

to justify the conviction.

Mannar Mannan Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1990) 1 SLR 280 was a

five judge Supreme Court decision where the learned trial judge failed to

direct the jury the value attached to the dock statement of the accused.

Relying on the proviso of section 334(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, it

was held by their lordships of the Supreme Court that although there was a

failure of the trial judge to properly direct the jury, even if properly directed

would inevitably and without doubt the jury would have returned the same

verdict. Therefore, dismissed the appeal on the basis that no substantial

miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

I find that although this was a case tried before a jury, the principles

discussed are the same and equally applicable to a determination of an

appeal under section 335 of the Criminal Procedure Code in view of the

proviso of Article 138 (1) of the Constitution, where the appellate jurisdiction

has been vested with the Court of Appeal.

The proviso of Article 138(1) reads;

Provided that no judgment decree or order of any Court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

Page 16 of 16

Accordingly, I find no basis for the contention that the accused was not

afforded a fair trial and a failure of justice has occasioned. On the contrary, I

am of the view that the learned trial judge has reached his verdict after

having considered all the relevant legal principles that is applicable in a

criminal trial with clear reasoning, which needs no disturbance from this

Court.

For the reasons adduced, I find no basis for the considered grounds of

appeal.

5th ground of appeal: -

Although this ground of appeal was raised on the basis that the learned trial

judge has applied the last seen theory erroneously, it was not pursued any

further by the learned counsel for accused, which need no further

consideration.

As I find no basis for the appeal for the aforementioned reasons, the appeal

is dismissed.
