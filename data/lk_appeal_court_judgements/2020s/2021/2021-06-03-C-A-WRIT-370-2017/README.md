Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

The Petitioner states that she was an employee of the Food and Agriculture

Organisation of the United Nations Office in Colombo (the FAO) during the period

April 1998 to September 2011. She states that her services were unlawfully

terminated by the FAO on 30th September 2011.

Complaint to the Commissioner General of Labour

Aggrieved by the said decision of the FAO, the Petitioner made a complaint to the 2nd

Respondent, the Commissioner General of Labour on 25th November 2011. The

Petitioner states that in response to a notice dated 10th February 2012 sent by the

Deputy Commissioner of Labour to appear at a formal inquiry in relation to the

complaint made by the Petitioner, the FAO had sent the Ministry of External Affairs a

Note Verbale dated 27th February 2012 marked P5b, wherein, the FAO had taken up

the position that they are entitled to immunities and privileges under the following

instruments:

1. The Constitution of the FAO signed in Quebec on 16th October 1945, to which

Sri Lanka has acceded on 21st May 1948;

2. The Agreement between FAO and Sri Lanka regarding FAO representation

accepted by Sri Lanka on 1st December 1978.

The FAO has also made reference to the fact that the Agreement between the FAO

and the Government of Sri Lanka, which makes reference to the Convention on

Privileges and Immunities of Specialised Agencies, provides in clear terms in Article I

Section 4 that: the Specialised Agencies, their property and assets, wherever located

and by whomsoever held, shall enjoy immunity from every form of legal process,

except insofar as, in any particular case, they have expressly waived their immunity.

The position of the FAO in the said Note Verbale is that the abovementioned

international treaties grant to the FAO unrestricted immunity from the jurisdiction of

national courts and that matters arising from employment disputes are governed by

the internal rules of the Organisation (Constitution, General Rules of the

3

Organisation, Staff Regulations, Staff Rules, Manual Sections and Administrative

Issuances) to the exclusion of any national law. The rationale for this as provided in

the said Note Verbale is as follows:

If the laws of any Member Nation were held to be applicable to the

employment relations between FAO and its personnel, and the national courts

competent to adjudicate on such disputes, it would harm the concept of an

independent international civil service and prevent the proper functioning of

the FAO. It is for this reason that the Constitution of FAO, like that of other

international organisations, prescribed the governance mechanisms by which

individual Member Nations may influence the functioning of the Organisation,

and to prohibit any attempt by individual member Nations to exert influence

outside the framework of those mechanisms.

The Petitioner states that since there was no representation or appearance by the

FAO before the Commissioner General of Labour, the Petitioner was advised by the

officials of the Department of Labour to institute proceedings before the Labour

Tribunal.

Letter issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2006

The Petitioner states that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued a letter dated

26th July 2006 marked X3 in respect of another employee who was similarly

circumstanced as the Petitioner. In X3, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had stated as

follows:

Government of Sri Lanka wishes to reaffirm that it will apply to the staff, funds,

property and assets of the FAO the provisions of the Convention on the

Privileges and Immunities of Specialised Agencies in accordance with the

Constitution of the FAO (1948) and the Agreement between the FAO and Sri

Lanka regarding the FAO Representation of 1978.

However, in the interpretation and the application of these instruments, Sri

Lanka will be guided by the current status of international law and the practice

pertaining to claims of immunity. International law and State practice do not

recognise matters arising out of termination of contracts of employment as

4

falling within the scope of jurisdictional immunities. International organisations

cannot be placed in a more favourable position than a State concerning the

enjoyment of immunities in respect of such categories of disputes.

Accordingly, the question of imposing its own system of laws, labour policies

and social values etc. referred to in the Note Verbale does not arise.

Accordingly, although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was of the view that the FAO

was entitled to immunity under the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of

Specialised Agencies in accordance with the Constitution of the FAO (1948) and the

Agreement between the FAO and Sri Lanka regarding the FAO Representation of

1978, it was of the view that the immunity afforded under these instruments could

not be extended to matters arising out of contracts of employment, being guided by

the current status of international law and the practice pertaining to claims of

immunity.

The Petitioner states that by letter dated 19th March 2012 marked P5, she sought

confirmation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs if the above position reflects the

current position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and that by letter dated 5th April

2012 marked X2, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that position.

Application to the Labour Tribunal

The Petitioner states that she instituted an application before the Labour Tribunal on

or about 28th March 2012, her complaint being that her services were terminated

unlawfully and unjustly by the FAO. The Petitioner states that although the learned

President of the Labour Tribunal issued notice on the employer, the FAO was not

represented before the Labour Tribunal.

The Petitioner states that she had produced X2 and X3 during the course of her

evidence before the Labour Tribunal. The Labour Tribunal had requested the

presence of a representative from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to confirm the

contents of X3. The Petitioner states that on 24th June 2013, a Legal Officer from the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave evidence before the Labour Tribunal and confirmed

5

the above position.1 In response to a specific question by the Attorney-at-Law for the

Petitioner whether matters arising out of the termination of employment do not

come within the ambit of jurisdictional immunity, the representative from the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs had responded in the affirmative.

Due to non-appearance by the FAO, the Labour Tribunal had proceeded to hear the

matter ex parte, and subsequently made an order in favour of the Petitioner

declaring that the services of the Petitioner had been terminated unjustly and

unlawfully. The Labour Tribunal had awarded the Petitioner compensation in a sum

of Rs. 2,370,857.19 by its Order dated 15th November 2013 marked X7.

Request by the Petitioner to the 2nd Respondent to enforce the Order of the Labour

Tribunal

The Petitioner states that the FAO did not comply with the Order of the Labour

Tribunal, even though the said Order was duly conveyed to the FAO. The Petitioner

had thereafter informed the Respondents of the FAOs failure to comply with the

said Order and moved that the Respondents enforce the said Order of the Labour

Tribunal in terms of the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act.

The decision of the Commissioner General of Labour

The Respondents have produced a letter dated 3rd May 2016 marked 2R1, sent by

the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Labour, informing them of the

legal position with regard to the jurisdictional immunities enjoyed by the FAO. 2R1

appears to be in response to a query raised by the Department of Labour in respect

of the position on immunity of the FAO. In the said letter, the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs had taken up the position that the FAO enjoys immunity due to:

(1) the Agreement between the FAO and the Government of Sri Lanka; and

(2) the Constitution of the FAO signed in Quebec on 16th December 1945.

1 Vide proceedings before the Labour Tribunal dated 24th June 2013 marked X5.

6

By letter dated 9th June 2016, marked P7, the 1st Respondent had informed the

Petitioner that no action can be taken against the FAO as the said Organisation was

immune from legal action under:

1) The Agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka and the FAO dated 1st

December 1978;

2) The Constitution of the FAO signed in Quebec on 16th October 1945.

It appears that the basis for the decision contained in P7 is the advice contained in

2R1. It must be noted that the position taken by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in

2R1 appears to be contrary to that taken before the Labour Tribunal, in that 2R1

does not make any reference to an exception to the application of immunity to

employment disputes.

Aggrieved by the decision of the Commissioner General of Labour in P7, the

Petitioner filed this application seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the said decision

and a Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to take steps in terms of the

Industrial Disputes Act to enforce the said award.

The primary issue that must be considered by this Court is whether the Respondents

acted illegally or irrationally when they came to the conclusion that the Order of the

Labour Tribunal was unenforceable on the basis that the FAO had immunity from

judicial proceedings before the domestic Courts of Sri Lanka.

Legal framework of immunity enjoyed by International Organisations

Before proceeding to consider the applicability of the above two instruments to the

facts of the present case, I will briefly lay down the legal framework surrounding the

granting of immunity to International Organisations before the domestic Courts of Sri

Lanka.

7

What is an International Organisation?

Although there is no strict legal definition of what constitutes an International

Organisation, legal scholars have attempted to provide a few defining features

shared by what are usually considered as International Organisations. As stated in

Bowetts Law of International Institutions:2

International organisations exist in a variety of forms, and the term is capable

of reflecting different situations. Commentators are in general agreement that

for an entity to qualify as an international organisation, it must have the

following characteristics:

- Its membership must be composed of states and/or other international

organisations;

- It must be established by treaty or other instrument governed by

international law, such as a resolution adopted in an international

conference;

- It must have an autonomous will distinct from that of its members and be

vested with legal personality; and

- It must be capable of adopting norms (in the broadest sense) addressed to

its members.3

Therefore, International Organisations are generally creatures of treaty or other

international instruments, governed by International law. Their role and mandate

will be defined and provided for within the scope of the instrument that created

them, and their membership will be generally composed of States and/or other

international organisations.

2 Philippe Sands Q.C. and Pierre Klein, Bowetts Law of International Institutions [6th Edition, 2009] Sweet & Maxwell. 3 Ibid. pages 15-16.

8

Legal personality under domestic law

The ability for International Organisations to possess legal personality would depend

on whether they meet the requirements which that legal system posits for

acceptance of the Organisations personality.4 This is explicitly provided for in the

constituent treaties of international organisations. For example, in terms of Article

104 of the United Nations Charter, The Organisation shall enjoy in the territory of

each of its Members such legal capacity as may be necessary for the exercise of its

functions and the fulfilment of its purposes.

The Sri Lankan legal system is dualist in nature, and it therefore treats municipal law

and international law as two distinct systems of law. In Singarasa v Attorney

General,5 Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva with four other Judges of the Supreme Court

agreeing, held as follows:

the framework of our Constitution to which reference would be made

presently, which is based on the perspective of municipal law and international

law being two distinct systems or the dualist theory as generally described. The

Classic distinction of the two theories characterized as monist and dualist is that

in terms of the monist theory international law and municipal law constitute a

single legal system. Therefore the generally recognized rules of international

law constitute an integral part of the municipal law and produce direct legal

effect without any further law being enacted within a country. According to the

dualist theory international law and municipal law are two separate and

independent legal systems, one national and the other international. The latter

being International law regulates relations between States based on customary

law and treaty law. Whereas the former, national law, attributes rights and

duties to individuals and legal persons deriving its force from the national

Constitution.

It is seen from these Articles [Articles 3, 4 and 5] forming its effective

framework that our Constitution is cast in a classic Republican mould where

Sovereignty within and in respect of the territory constituting one country, is

4 Jan Klabbers, An Introduction to International Institutional Law [2nd Edition, 2009], Cambridge University Press, page 44. 5 [2013] 1 Sri LR 245

9

reposed in the People. Sovereignty includes legislative, executive and judicial

power, exercised by the respective organs of government for and in trust for the

People. There is a functional separation in the exercise of power derived from

the Sovereignty of the People by the three organs of government, the executive,

legislative and judiciary. The organs of government do not have plenary power

that transcends the Constitution and the exercise of power is circumscribed by

the Constitution and written law that derive its authority therefrom. This is a

departure from the monarchical form of government such as the UK based on

plenary power and omnipotence.international treaties entered into by the

President and the Government of Sri Lanka as permitted by and consistent

with the Constitution and written law would bind the Republic qua State but

have to be implemented by statute enacted under the Constitution to have

internal effect.

Therefore, under the Sri Lankan legal framework, although International instruments

may bind the State upon ratification, they can only be given effect to internally, as a

part of the domestic legal framework, through enabling legislation duly enacted by

Parliament. This principle is no different in respect of International instruments

relating to International Organisations.

As stated in Bowetts Law of International Institutions:

By definition, the national legal personality of international organisations is

to produce effects in domestic legal orders. The process through which such

personality is recognised and given effect in national orders varies according to

a number of factorsBeing bound by the legal instruments generally the

constituent instrument - in which the organisations legal personality is

established, the member states are to grant it ipso facto recognition in their

domestic legal order. This will not raise any difficulty in monist states, where the

rules of international law binding on the state can be invoked directly before

national tribunals.6

In contrast, such a recognition will only be possible in dualist states if the

international norm from which the national legal personality of a given

6 Supra; page 481.

10

intergovernmental organisation flows has been incorporated in that states

domestic legal order. The most striking formulation of this principle can be

found in the House of Lords 1989 decision in the ITC case, finding that, the ITC

as a matter of English law owes its existence to the Order in Council. That is

what created the ITC in domestic law..7 In the United Kingdom, the adoption of

an Order in Council conferring upon international organisations to which that

state becomes a member the legal capacities of a body corporate,8 or the

enactment of a specific piece of legislation in respect to a given organisation are

the two ways in which the juridical personality of international organisations is

given effect in that countrys legal order.9

Generally in a dualist State, the legal personality of an International Organisation

would therefore be dependent on its recognition through domestic legislation.

Acceding to the Constitution of an International Organisation would not ipso facto

grant legal personality to an International Organisation in the domestic legal

framework. The ability of Courts to give effect to the provisions of such instruments,

including those which grant privileges and immunities to such International

Organisations, would be dependent on the steps taken by the legislature to enact

enabling legislation of a specific or general character.

Jurisdictional immunity

A plea of jurisdictional immunity before domestic Courts, if upheld, is a legal

impediment to a Courts function in respect of the party pleading immunity. It is

essentially a tool to deprive an aggrieved party from their right of access to Courts.

In respect of State Immunity or Sovereign Immunity, the rationale for granting

immunity to States in the domestic Courts of other states is founded on the basis

that all States are equal. As observed by the Supreme Court in The British High

Commission v. Ricardo Wilhelm Michael Jansen:10

7 J.H. Rayner v Department of Trade, October 26, 1989, 81 ILR 709 [per Lord Oliver of Aylmerton] 8 By virtue of the International Organisations Act 1968. 9 Bowetts paragraph 15-018; page 481. 10 SC Appeal No. 99/2012; SC Minutes of 10th July 2014.

11

The Latin maxim par in parem non habet imperium (one equal cannot

exercise authority over another) neatly summarizes the justification for

sovereign immunity.

The rationale for affording jurisdictional immunity to International Organisations is

different. As it cannot be argued that an International Organisation is equivalent to a

State, jurisdictional immunity is justified on the theory of functional necessity. The

general idea behind this theory is that Organisations enjoy immunities and privileges

as are necessary for their effective functioning: international organisations enjoy

what is necessary for the exercise of their functions in the fulfilment of their

purposes.11

In Sri Lanka, a plea of jurisdictional immunity, if upheld, will have the effect of

disabling the judicial power of the people which forms part of the Sovereignty of the

People through Article 4(c) by ousting the jurisdiction of Courts. Therefore, a plea of

immunity must be armed with the adequate and effective domestic legislation which

can give effect to it.

Diplomatic Privileges Act No. 9 of 1996

In Sri Lanka, the starting point for the granting of immunity is the Diplomatic

Privileges Act No. 9 of 1996 (the Act). As observed by the Supreme Court in The

British High Commission v. Ricardo Wilhelm Michael Jansen12

The Diplomatic Privileges Act No. 9 of 1996 is Sri Lankas response to its

dualist practice of enacting domestic legislation to give effect to its

international obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations

of 1961.

The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 is specifically in relation to

relationships between States and does not contain any reference to immunity that

should be afforded to International Organisations. However, Section 4 of the Act

recognises a mechanism for the Government of Sri Lanka to give effect to immunity

11 An Introduction to International Institutional Law (Supra). 12 SC Appeal No. 99/2012; SC Minutes of 10th July 2014.

12

provisions in Agreements entered into with inter-governmental and international

organisations.

Section 4 of the Act reads as follows:

(1) Where the Government of Sri Lanka has entered into an agreement with

any inter-governmental or international organization providing for the grant

of any immunities and privileges, to the officers or agents or property of such

organization, the Minister may, by Order published in the Gazette, and to the

extent necessary to give effect to the terms of such agreement, declare that

such of the provisions of this Act as are specified in such Order shall apply to

such officers, agents and property, of such organization as are, or is, specified in

such Order, to such extent as is specified therein, and upon the making of such

Order such, of the provisions of this Act as are specified therein, shall, mutatis

mutandis, apply to such officers, agents and property of such Organization as

are, or is, specified therein.

(2) Every Order made under this section shall recite or embody the terms of the

agreement in consequence of which such Order, was made and shall come into

force on the date of publication of such Order, or on such later date as may be

specified therein, and shall remain in force for so long, and so long only, as the

agreement in consequence of which such Order was made remains in force.

Section 4(1) of the Act presupposes the existence of an Agreement providing for

granting of immunity between the Government of Sri Lanka and the International

Organisation claiming immunity. A Section 4(1) Order is therefore a mechanism to

grant immunity to such Organisation, to the extent necessary to give effect to the

terms of such agreement. The Minister is also empowered to specify to what extent,

the provisions of the Act can apply to the said Organisation.

According to Section 5(1) of the Act, an Order made under Section 4(1) shall as soon

as convenient after its publication in the Gazette be placed before Parliament for

approval. An Order which is not approved shall be considered rescinded from the

date of disapproval.

13

In International Water Management Institute v. Kithsiri Jayakody13 the Supreme

Court was confronted with a similar issue to that in the present application, arising

from the unlawful termination of services of an employee of the International Water

Management Institute. Unlike in the present application, in that case, the

International Water Management Institute appeared before the Kaduwela Labour

Tribunal and took up a preliminary objection on the basis that it was entitled to

immunity under and in terms of the International Irrigation Management Act No. 6 of

1985, as amended by Act No. 50 of 2000, read with the Charter and Founding

Documents of the Appellants predecessor, the International Irrigation Management

Institute. The Institute in that case also submitted that its plea of immunity is

strengthened by the Order made by the relevant Minister dated 10th December 1997

in terms of Section 4(1) of the Act.

The Labour Tribunal and subsequently the Provincial High Court rejected the plea of

immunity on the basis that the Section 4(1) Order was not placed before Parliament

for approval. However, the Supreme Court went on to hold that a Section 4(1) Order

was capable of granting immunity even in the absence of being presented for

approval by the Parliament, unless and until such Order is rescinded. The Supreme

Court held that:

Of course, I must advert to the fact that there is absolutely no evidence that

the order made by the Minister was ever placed before Parliament, and there is

no certificate under the hand of the Secretary to the Ministry of the Minister in

charge of the subject of Foreign Affairs (currently External Affairs) which would

have been in terms of section 6 of the Diplomatic Privileges Act which would

have amounted to conclusive proof of the fact that the Appellant enjoyed

diplomatic immunity. However, in my opinion, the order under section 4(1) of

the Act, if made validly, would come into force when published in the Gazette,

and would remain in force until and unless it is disapproved by Parliament.

The failure to place the order before Parliament does not affect its coming

into force. It is also my opinion that a certificate under section 6, which would

have facilitated proof of immunity, is not indispensable to proving the existence

of immunity, if it can be established by other evidence, as the Appellant has

succeeded in doing in this appeal.

13 SC Appeal No. 11/2011; SC Minutes of 25th March 2014.

14

the step taken by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1997 to make an order in

terms of section 4(1) of the Diplomatic Privileges Act of 1996 was a positive

step to comply with the obligation of the Government of Sri Lanka under

section 33 of the International Water Management Institute Act No. 6 of 1985,

which expressly provided that the Government shall take all such steps as are

necessary to ensure that (a) the Institute; and (b) the Director General,

Consultants and officers and servants of the Institute, are accorded subject to

the provisions of the Constitution all such rights, privileges and immunities as

the Government has agreed to, accord to such Institute, the Director-General,

consultants and officers and servants of the Institute, by the Memorandum of

Agreement between the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka and the Ford Foundation, acting on behalf of the International Water

Management Institute Support Group, for the establishment of an International

Institute for Research and Training in Irrigation Management, signed on 1st

September, 1983.

It must be noted that in that case, the enabling Act, the International Irrigation

Management Act No. 6 of 1985, as amended by Act No. 50 of 2000, specifically

provided for the grant of all such rights, privileges and immunities as the

Government has agreed to. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court went onto to hold as

follows:

I have serious doubts as to whether the obligation cast on the Government of

Sri Lanka by section 33 of the International Irrigation Management Act 1985,

was by itself, sufficient to support a plea of immunity from suit in the Labour

Tribunal or any other court or tribunal. In my view, it was only a provision that

imposed on the government a legal obligation in the municipal sphere which a

Court of law, tribunal or other institution in Sri Lanka could take cognizance of

which is into accord with an obligation the government had incurred in the

international plain by entering to the Memorandum of Agreement with the

Ford Foundation on behalf of the International Irrigation (Water)

Management Institute Support Group.

15

Having said that, I answer question (b) in the affirmative,14 and hold that the

High Court did err in not coming to the finding that the International Irrigation

Management Institute Act No. 6 of 1985, as amended by Act No. 50 of 2000,

displayed the legislatures unambiguous intention to grant the said immunity,

but add the rider that that does not mean that section 33 of the International

Irrigation Management Institute Act, by itself, had the effect of conferring the

Appellant immunity from suit.

Thus, even though there existed an enabling Act which specifically provided for the

grant of all such rights, privileges and immunities, the Supreme Court was of the view

that, that by itself is not sufficient to support a plea of immunity from suit in the

Labour Tribunal or any other court or tribunal.

The Supreme Court has therefore made it abundantly clear that the act of granting

International Organisations immunity from jurisdiction before the Domestic Courts of

Sri Lanka must be done in accordance with the specific mechanism provided by the

Act.

Furthermore, Section 4(1) of the Act states that the Minister may declare that the

provisions of the Act shall apply to the extent necessary to give effect to the terms of

such provisions of any Agreement with the International Organisation, thereby

affording the Minister a discretion to take a positive step to give effect to any

obligations arising from the terms of such Agreement. Therefore, the granting of

immunity to an International Organisation is effected by a positive act, and certainly

cannot be implied through the provisions of an Agreement between the Government

of Sri Lanka and the International Organisation.

Resort to customary International Law

The above position can be distinguished from the position taken by the Supreme

Court in The British High Commission v. Ricardo Wilhelm Michael Jansen.15 The

Supreme Court in that case found that the applicable rules were those of sovereign

14 Question (b) Did the High Court err in not coming to the finding that the International Irrigation Management Institute Act No. 6 of 1985, as amended by Act No. 50 of 2000, displayed the legislatures unambiguous intention to grant the said immunity 15 Supra.

16

immunity and not diplomatic immunity. In the absence of legislation specifically

dealing with the question of State or Sovereign Immunity, the Court looked to

customary international law for interpretative guidance in order to give substance to

the concept of Sovereign Immunity which is very much a part of our law.16 The

Supreme Court found justification for sovereign immunity in the Latin maxim par in

parem non habet imperium (one equal cannot exercise authority over another).

Drawing examples of State practice, the Supreme Court held as follows:

The maintenance of security in the mission could not be classified as merely

auxiliary but in my view since the duties of the Respondent were integral to the

core sphere of sovereign activity, the contract of employment was not effected

in the capacity of a private citizen and the functions of the Respondent were

enlisted in the interest of the public service of the UK Government and on

these premises I am irresistibly drawn to the inescapable conclusion that

immunity becomes applicable in the instant case.

However, where there is a specific mechanism provided by the law, jurisdictional

immunity for international organisations cannot be inferred or implied through

custom.

As held by the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Amaratunga v. Northwest

Atlantic Fisheries Organisation:17

In the case of international organizations, unlike that of states, the prevailing

view at present is that no rule of customary international law confers

immunity on them. International organizations derive their existence from

treaties and the same holds true for their rights to immunities.18 Such an

organization must operate on the territory of a foreign state and through

individuals who have nationality and is therefore vulnerable to interference,

since it possesses neither territory nor a population of its own.19 This reality

makes immunity essential to the efficient and independent functioning of

16 See BASL Journal 2020 Volume XXV page 433; S. Dias. 17 [2013] 3 SCR 866. 18H. Fox, The Law of State Immunity (2nd Ed. 2008), at pp. 725-26 19Ibid; at page 724

17

international organizations. It also shapes the immunities and privileges that

are granted to international organizations. Such immunities and privileges are

created through a complex interplay of international agreements and the

national law of host states.20

Reasons contained in P7 to grant immunity to the FAO

I shall now consider (a) the Constitution of the FAO signed in Quebec on 16th October

1945, and (b) the Agreement between the FAO and the Government of Sri Lanka

dated 1st December 1978, which are the two documents that were relied upon by

the Respondents to arrive at their decision contained in P7.

Constitution of the FAO signed in Quebec on 16th October 1945

There is no doubt that the FAO is an International Organisation, having been

established by the United Nations Conference on Food and Agriculture, which met in

May-June 1943. There is also no dispute between the parties that it has its own

Constitution dated 16th October 1945 and that Sri Lanka has acceded to the

Constitution of the FAO on 21st May 1948.

Article XVI of the Constitution of the FAO contains the following provisions relating to

the Legal Status of the FAO:

1. The Organisation shall have the capacity of legal person to perform any

legal act appropriate to its purpose which is not beyond the powers

granted to it by this Constitution;

2. Each Member nation undertakes, insofar be possible under its

constitutional procedure, to accord to the Organisation all immunities

and facilities which it accords to diplomatic missions, including

inviolability of premises and archives, immunity from suit, and

exemptions from taxation;

20 See W. M. Berenson, Squaring the Concept of Immunity with the Fundamental Right to a Fair Trial: The Case of the OAS, in H. Ciss, D. D. Bradlow and B. Kingsbury, eds., The World Bank Legal Review (2012), vol. 3, 133. See also L. Preuss, The International Organizations Immunities Act (1946), 40 Am. J. Intl L. 332, at p. 345.

18

3. The Conference shall make provision for the determination by an

administrative tribunal of disputes relating to the conditions and terms of

appointment of members of the staff.

It must be noted here that the legal obligation on member states to accord to the

FAO, all immunities and facilities which it accords to diplomatic missions, is only

insofar as it is consistent with its Constitutional provisions. This further buttresses

the fact that immunity to the FAO cannot, under any circumstance, be implied in the

absence of the constitutionally mandated mechanism provided for in the Act.

The Agreement between the FAO and the Government of Sri Lanka

Even where States have signed the international instruments establishing

international organisations, while those agreements are of a multilateral character,

it has often been found necessary to conclude a bilateral agreement with the host

state in whose territory the headquarters or other offices of the organisations are

maintained.21

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has referred to an Agreement between the FAO and

the Government of Sri Lanka in 2R1 and therefore P7 refers to such an Agreement

dated 1st December 1978. However, it must be noted that the said Agreement was

not produced before this Court. The learned Senior State Counsel has annexed with

her written submissions dated 11th January 2019, a letter dated 13th December 2018

issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in response to certain clarifications sought

by the learned Senior State Counsel on the inconsistent positions taken by the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs in respect of the jurisdictional immunity purportedly

granted to the FAO. This letter appears to contain the final position of the Ministry of

Foreign Affairs with regard to the issue on immunity. Although the Ministry of

Foreign Affairs had stated that the said Agreement dated 1st December 1978 has

been marked Annex I the document marked Annex I was an incomplete document

dated 18th September 1978, issued by the Director-General of the FAO to the

Minister of Agriculture and Lands, providing certain proposals on the Appointment

of an FAO Representative in Sri Lanka which was due to constitute an Agreement

upon its acceptance by the Government of Sri Lanka. The letter of acceptance

however was not submitted. Upon this Court seeking clarifications from the learned

Senior State Counsel, a letter dated 23rd September 2020 issued by the Ministry of

Foreign Affairs was produced before this Court. The said letter contained six

annexures, and the fourth annexure appears to be the acceptance letter to the

document marked Annex I. I must note at this stage that none of these annexures

were referred to or made available to the Respondents by the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs.

The said Acceptance letter dated 4th January 1979 issued by the Ambassador for Sri

Lanka in Italy to the Director General of the FAO in Rome in response to the letter

dated 18th September 1978 by the FAO to the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands,

states as follows:

I have the honour to state that the above proposals are acceptable to the

Government of Sri Lanka and therefore your letter and this reply constitute an

agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka and the FAO.

Clause 5 thereof states as follows:

(5) To the extent that it is not already bound to do so, the Government of Sri

Lanka agrees to apply to the Organisation, its staff, funds, property and assets,

the provisions of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the

Specialised Agencies. The FAO Representative shall be accorded the treatment

provided for in Section 21 of the said Convention. The Government also agrees

to grant to FAO, and to the FAO Representative and his staff, privileges and

immunities not less favourable than those granted to any other international

organisation and its staff in Sri Lanka.

The aforementioned letter dated 23rd September 2020 by the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs also makes reference to three other Agreements between the Government of

Sri Lanka and International Organisations including the FAO.

The first is an Agreement dated 16th December 1954 between the Government of

Ceylon and The United Nations, The International Labour Organisation, The FAO, The

United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, The International

20

Civil Aviation Organisation and The World Health Organisation. The scope of the

Agreement appears to be contained in the preamble, which reads as follows:

Desiring to give effect to the resolutions and decisions relating to technical

assistance of the Organisations, which are intended to promote the economic

and social progress and development of peoples.

Article V of the said Agreement titled Facilities, Privileges and Immunities contains

the following immunity clause applicable to all the Organisations named in the

Agreement:

The Government, insofar as it is not already bound to do so, shall apply to the

Organisation(s), their property, funds and assets, and to their officials including

technical assistance experts, the provision of the Convention on the Privileges

and Immunities of the United Nations and the Convention on the Privileges and

Immunities of the Specialised Agencies.

The said Agreement had been signed by the Acting Permanent Secretary of the

Ministry of Defence and External Affairs and the Representative in Ceylon, United

Nations Technical Assistance Board, and has been duly presented to Parliament by

the Minister of External Affairs.

It must be noted that although this is not the Agreement between the Government

of Ceylon and the FAO that has been referred to in P7, this Agreement signed on

16th December 1954 may constitute an Agreement between the FAO and the

Government of Sri Lanka, and an Order under Section 4(1) of the Act may be

published by the Minister to give effect to Article V of the Agreement in respect of

the FAO, to the extent specified therein.

The second Agreement is titled Basic Agreement between the Government of

Ceylon and the United Nations/ FAO World Food Programme Concerning Assistance

from the World Food Programme. The scope of this Agreement appears to be

limited to the assistance rendered by the World Food Programme.

21

The third Agreement is the Agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka and the

United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) signed in 1990. The scope of the

said Agreement is contained in Article I which reads as follows:

This Agreement embodies the basic conditions under which the UNDP and its

Executing Agencies shall assist the Government in carrying out its development

projects, and under which such UNDP-assisted projects shall be executed. It shall

apply to all such UNDP assistance and to such Project Documents or other

instruments (hereinafter called Project Documents) as the Parties may conclude

to define the particulars of such assistance and the respective responsibilities of

the Parties and the Executing Agency hereunder in more detail in regard to such

projects.

The learned Senior State Counsel has relied on the immunity provision contained in

the said Agreement - i.e. Article IX - to support the position that the FAO is entitled to

jurisdictional immunity.

Article IX reads as follows:

1. The Government shall apply to the United Nations and its organs, including

the UNDP and UN subsidiary organs acting as UNDP Executing Agencies,

their property, funds and assets, and to their officials, including the

resident representative and other members of the UNDP mission in the

country, the provisions of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities

of the United Nations.

2. The Government shall apply to each Specialised Agency acting as an

Executing Agency, its property, funds and assets, and to its officials, the

provisions of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the

Specialised Agencies, including any Annex to the Convention applicable to

such Specialised Agency. In case the International Atomic Energy Agency

(IAEA) acts as an Executing Agency, the Government shall apply to its

property, funds and assets, and to its officials and experts, the Agreement

on the Privileges and Immunities of the IAEA.

22

The Respondents have not produced any material to show that the FAOs presence in

Sri Lanka, and the role exercised by the FAO in Sri Lanka has any nexus to the UNDP.

Therefore, even if it were to be accepted that the said Agreement between the

UNDP and the Government of Sri Lanka was to extend to the FAO, it would have to

be limited to those instances described in the Scope of the Agreement.

Order under the Diplomatic Privileges Act

As observed above, accession to the Constitution of the FAO, or entering into an

Agreement with the FAO which provides for the grant of privileges and immunities to

the FAO by itself is not sufficient to uphold a plea of immunity, ousting the

jurisdiction of Courts and thereby restricting the right of access of a citizen to a Court

of Law. There must therefore exist an Order made under Section 4(1) of the Act.

The Respondents have produced Extraordinary Gazette No. 1987/23 dated 5th

October 2016, containing several Orders issued by the Minister of Foreign Affairs

under Section 4 of the Act. The Orders contained in the said Gazette are in respect of

the following International Organisations:

International Water Management Institute

United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)

Colombo Plan Bureau

International Labour Organisation

International Committee of the Red Cross

World Conservation Union IUCN (International Union for Conservation of

Nature and Natural Resources)

Commission of the European Communities, Economic Development

Cooperation Fund.

Even though none of the Orders contained in the said Gazette provides any

reference to the FAO or to any Agreement between the Government and the FAO to

which I have referred to earlier, or to the Agreement between the FAO and the

Government referred to in P7, the learned Senior State Counsel has relied on the

Section 4(1) Order made in respect of the UNDP to support the argument that the

23

FAO is entitled to jurisdictional immunity, on the basis that the FAO is an executing

agency of the UNDP.

The relevant sections of the said Order are reproduced below:

By virtue of the powers vested in me by Section 4 of the Diplomatic Privileges Act, No. 9 of 1996, I Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Foreign Affairs, do, by this Order, declare that the provisions of the aforesaid Act shall apply in respect of the United Nations Development Programme, to the extent necessary to give effect to the terms of the Agreement, entered into with the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, on 20th March 1990, the relevant articles of which Agreement are recited in the Schedule hereto.

SCHEDULE

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA AND THE UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME ARTICLE IX PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES

1. The Government shall apply to the United Nations and its organs, including the UNDP and UN subsidiary organs acting as UNDP Executing Agencies, their property, funds and assets, and to their officials, including the resident representative and other members of the UNDP mission in the country, the provisions of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations. 2. The Government shall apply to each Specialised Agency acting as an Executing Agency, its property, funds and assets, and to its officials, the provisions of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialised Agencies, including any Annex to the Convention applicable to such Specialised Agency. In case the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) acts as an Executing Agency, the Government shall apply to its property, funds and assets, and to its officials and experts, the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the IAEA.

24

3. Members of the UNDP mission, in the country shall be granted such additional privileges and immunities as may be necessary for the effective exercise by the mission of its functions as mutually agreed. Thus, while all Orders made under Section 4(1) of the Act and set out in the aforementioned Gazette relate to a specific international organisation named in such Order, and to a specific agreement that the Government of Sri Lanka has entered into with those organisations, there is no specific Order in favour of the FAO nor is there any specific reference to the FAO in the Order made in favour of the UNDP. It is somewhat inconceivable that the legislature would allow for something which impacts the rights of the citizenry as much as the ouster of the jurisdiction of the Courts of Sri Lanka to be effected through a vague reference to a provision of an Agreement in respect of another International Organisation. On the material placed before this Court, it is clear that the FAO and the UNDP are separate organisations by virtue of the fact that they have separate international instruments creating and governing them. Even if the argument of the learned Senior State Counsel was accepted, the immunity granted through the said Order in favour of the UNDP would only be applicable where the FAO acts as an Executing Agency of the UNDP, or a Specialised Agency acting as an Executing Agency of the UNDP, a link which has not been established before this Court. Conclusion In the above circumstances, I am of the view that in arriving at its decision in P7, the Respondents have failed to take into consideration the following material factors: a) That accession by Sri Lanka to the Constitution of the FAO is insufficient by itself to grant immunity to the FAO; b) That an agreement that Sri Lanka may have with the FAO is insufficient by itself to grant immunity to the FAO; c) That there must exist an Order under Section 4(1) of the Act granting immunity to the FAO if the Respondents are to refrain from enforcing the Labour Tribunal award;

25

d) Whether the Order under Section 4(1) made in favour of the UNDP is adequate to enable immunity to be afforded to the FAO. As stated in De Smiths Judicial Review:

An administrative decision or other exercise of a public function is unlawful under the broad chapter head of illegality if the decision-maker:

(a) Misinterprets a legal instrument relevant to the functions being

performed; (b) (d) ... (e) takes into account irrelevant considerations or fails to take account of

relevant considerations.22

If the exercise of a discretionary power has been influenced by considerations that cannot lawfully be taken into account, or by the disregard of relevant considerations required to be taken into account (expressly or impliedly), a court will normally hold that the power has not been validly exercised.23 I am therefore of the view that P7 is illegal. I accordingly issue a Writ of Certiorari to quash P7. Whether the FAO is an executing agency of the UNDP and is entitled to immunity in terms of the Order made in favour of the UNDP and especially its Schedule, is a question of fact which this Court cannot go into in this application. I therefore direct the 2nd Respondent to consider all of the above and arrive at a suitable decision in terms of the law. The 2nd Respondent may in that regard, seek the views of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and afford the Petitioner an opportunity of placing any material before it. I make no order with regard to costs.
