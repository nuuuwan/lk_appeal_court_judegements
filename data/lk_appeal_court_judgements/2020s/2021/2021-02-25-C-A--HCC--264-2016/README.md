The 1st accused appellant has preferred the instant appeal seeking

to set aside the judgment dated 29.11.2016 of the learned High Court

Judge of Panadura convicting him for Murder in Case No:HC

1629/2002 in the High Court of Panadura.

3

1. The 1st Accused-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Appellant) along with five other Accused were indicted before

the High Court of Panadura for the following charges.

I. That on or about 29.06.1997 at Horethuduwa within the

jurisdiction of this court the Accused being members of an

unlawful assembly the common object of which was to cause

hurt to one Rukmal Wasantha thereby committed an offence

punishable under section 140 of the Penal Code.

II. That in the aforementioned time, place and during the

course of the same transaction whilst being members of said

unlawful assembly the accused committed murder of one

Rukmal Wasantha and thereby committed an offence

punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code read with

section 146 of the Penal Code.

III. That in the aforementioned time, place and during the

course of the same transaction whilst being members of the

said unlawful assembly the accused committed the murder

of one Rukmal Wasantha and thereby committed an offence

punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code read with

section 32 of the Penal Code.

At the conclusion of the trial, the 1st accused appellant was

convicted for murder on count 3 and sentenced to death and acquitted

on counts 1 and 2. The 2nd to the 6th accused were acquitted on all

counts.

4

Being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence the appellant has

preferred the instant appeal. The grounds of appeal advanced by the

appellant are as follows;

i. The Trial court was in error when it failed to give due

consideration to the failure of the prosecution to prove the

date of offence beyond reasonable doubt.

ii. The Trial Court was in error when it has accepted and relied

on the evidence with regard to the identification parade

despite its doubtful nature and the existence of many

inherent weaknesses.

iii. The Trial court was in error when it has failed to consider

the glaring contradictions and the omissions of the

prosecution witnesses.

iv. The Trial Court was in error when it has failed to consider

the explanation provided by the accused in their dock

statements.

v. The trial court was in error when it has not properly

considered the failure of the prosecution to prove beyond a

reasonable doubt the recovery and identification of the

productions.

The prosecution has led the evidence of 08 witnesses of whom,

PW 1, PW 3, PW 20, the JMO and PW 10 police officer Kodithuwakku

the investigating officers evidence is the most vital and deciding

evidence.

5

The factual circumstances albeit briefly are as follows.

On 29.06.1997 around 10.00 pm, the deceased together with

PW 1, PW 3, and Shantha had gone for a musical show at

Chandrasekera Ground in Horethuduwa. Around midnight PW 1 and

PW 3 have left the grounds to have a drink while the other two have

stayed back. When they returned after about 45 minutes, they have

learnt that the deceased and Shantha have had an argument with some

others on the ground for knocking against them while dancing.

Thereafter, according to the prosecution witnesses PW 1 and

PW 3 they have left the ground when the musical event was still in

progress with the 4th accused who is known to PW 1. It was stated that

the 4th accused had indicated that his friends with whom the altercation

took place must be around waiting for them but, that he will shape up

the matter.

When they were passing the timber mill, the 4th accused has

whistled, which was interpreted as giving a signal and about 10 to 15

people have come out from the opposite side of the road and followed

the deceased who had by this time started to run towards the timber

mill, while the witnesses PW 1 and PW 3 have tried to catch hold of the

4th accused. After a while the persons who followed the deceased in to

the mill have come out and fled away in a three wheeler and the

deceased was found fallen and bleeding inside the timber mill. On

admission to hospital he has been pronounced dead.

The defense version is that the appellant was at the musical show

with friends and returned home around 2.00 am. A couple of days later

6

on an invitation by Roy Rajaratne PW 20 he had attended a party in an

abandoned house about 200 meters from PW 20s house where the 2nd

and 3rd accused were also present. Thereafter, the police had come and

taken them in to custody. At the Police Station, they were pointed out

to several people including the witnesses in this case and later indicted.

At the hearing, the appeal was argued on many grounds, and it

was submitted that the prosecution has not proved the case against the

appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

PW 1 and PW 3 who have been with the deceased before he was

injured, are eye witnesses to certain incidents. However, they have not

witnessed the actual incident, neither the altercation of the purported

knocking into each other with the 1st accused while dancing, nor getting

injured inside the mill.

The learned counsel for the appellant has drawn the attention of

this Court to certain inconsistencies and contradictions inter se of the

evidence of PW 1 and PW 3. There are also certain discrepancies with

regard to the identification of the accused by PW 1 and PW 3 at the

identification parade, and their evidence in the Magistrates Court and

at the trial which were referred to by the Counsel for the appellant.

The identification parades had been held on 21.07.1997 and

25.05.1998 approximately a month and 11 months after the incident.

PW 1 had identified the 3rd, to the 5th accused and PW 3 has identified

the 1st to the 5th accused.

7

The following are some relevant discrepancies in the evidence.

1. PW 01 in evidence has stated that he saw the appellant holding

a blood stained knife with a blade of about 4 or 5 inches in length

in his right hand, but has failed to identify the appellant at the

identification parade.

2. PW 01 in evidence has stated he had identified the 1st, 2nd and

the 3rd accused at the identification parade but the learned trial

judge has stated it was the 3rd, 4th and the 5th accused that had

been identified.

3. PW 01 has stated that he and PW 3 gave statements to the police

at the same time when factually the statement of PW 3 is a few

days after the incident.

It is apparent that one can expect the recollection of a witness to be

more accurate and fresher near the date of identification parade if done

soon after the date of the incident, as in this case. However, surprisingly

PW 01 has failed to identify the appellant at the identification parade.

It is accepted that there may be instances where witnesses may be

forgetful of certain incidents after the passage of time. But in the instant

case when a very descriptive explanation is given of the accused a few

years later after the incident, it is questionable why and how PW 1 failed

to identify the accused a few months after the incident at the

identification parade. Therefore, this fact has to be taken cognizance of.

It is also important to note that the counsel for the appellant has

objected to the holding of the identification parade on the basis that the

accused were pointed out to the witnesses at the police station.

8

This fact is borne out by the evidence of PW 20 where he has

emphatically stated that at the police station the 1st accused appellant

was pointed out to him. Thereafter, he had seen the other accused

being brought to the police station. (pages 494-498 of the brief)

Furthermore, the relatives of the deceased had also been at the police

station at that time. Thus, it appears that the suspects produced at the

identification parade were not provided the safeguards they were

entitled to by law. Thus, a reasonable doubt is created whether the

identification parade was held in a fair manner.

It was established that the statement of PW 3 had been recorded

a few days later after the incident. In evidence when questioned about

certain statements regarding the identification of the accused and their

whereabouts, he has answered stating that he may have got the

information from PW 1 Samantha. This creates a doubt whether the

information given to the police by PW 3 is from his personal knowledge

or from facts gathered from a third party. Thus, the credibility of the

evidence of PW 3 is also questionable.

PW 20 Roy Rajaratne is the driver in whose three wheeler the

accused are said to have got away after injuring the deceased. According

to the appellant the police have taken the three accused in to custody

from an abandoned house belonging to PW 20 and the accused have

gone there on an invitation for a party by PW20 who was leaving the

country on employment abroad. The main police investigating officer

has described PW 20 as a police informant for about 3 years, which fact

PW 20 has vehemently denied. It was the position of the defense at the

trial that the suspects were apprehended on information provided by

PW 20.

9

The evidence of PW 20 finding a knife underneath the carpet of

the three wheeler which he came across when cleaning the three

wheeler in the morning after dropping off the 6 people at Paraththa, and

keeping the knife in the same place for a couple of days (page 421 of the

brief) and leaving the vehicle in the night in the premises of the owner

of the vehicle is not probable.

With regard to the three wheeler being brought to the police

station his evidence is unclear. At one point he has stated that the

three wheeler was already at the police station when he gave the

statement. (page 436) But, in his statement he has stated that he can

show where the three wheeler is parked.

In such a circumstance, the purported recovery of the knife on a

section 27 statement by the appellant also does not add up. There are

several other such inconsistencies in the evidence of PW 20. So much

so, that at one time one of the predecessor High Court Judges has

recorded an observation in page 429 about the contradictory evidence

given by PW 20. When the evidence of PW 20 is considered as a whole,

it is apparent PW 20 was not consistent and when he is confronted that

his evidence is contradictory he has stated he cannot remember.

A person who has gone to the length of getting the three accused

to his place under the guise of having a party, then to go missing and

the police evidence being that an informant divulged where the accused

were, it is difficult to comprehend the motive of PW 20 to be constantly

changing the evidence. The doubt created about the evidentiary value

10

of PW 20, by his inconsistent evidence must inure to the benefit of the

appellant.

The chief investigation officer Kodithuwakku in page 557 of the

brief, has stated that on information from a private informer he arrested

the three suspects. Further, that the knife was recovered from under

the carpet of the three wheeler driven by PW 20 on the statement of the

1st accused.

He has also admitted that the statement of PW 20 was recorded

before he took the suspects in to custody and in page 586 of the brief

he has reluctantly admitted that PW 20 has informed him about a knife

being inside the three wheeler when making the statement. Thus, it is

abundantly clear that the evidence that the knife was recovered on a

section 27 statement is incorrect. There is also other contradictory

evidence by PW 20 and the Investigating officer which is not sufficiently

addressed by the learned trial judge.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the State,

following the best traditions of the Attorney Generals Department

submitted that for several reasons he cannot support the conviction.

One ground being that, according to the evidence of the

Prosecution witnesses the incident has occurred around 2.00-2.30 in

the morning and that the culprits fled away in a three wheeler

thereafter.

11

However. according to PW 20, he has picked up the hire around

4.30 in the morning. Thus, there is a glaring discrepancy of a lapse of

two hours to connect the accused to the alleged incident.

Further, whether the evidence of PW 20 is probable when he

testified that after seeing a knife in the vehicle and not divulging that

evidence and going ahead with his day to day business; the Police

evidence which is contrary to the evidence of PW 20 in that the

investigating officer admitting that the weapon was discovered on a

section 27 recovery however, later admitting that PW 20 informed about

the knife being in the vehicle, when considered in totality, is not

probable evidence.

It is important to consider that according to PW 11, a police

witness, the incident has been reported to the Police at 5.00 am on

29.06.1997. Thus, it is apparent that there is clear contradicting

evidence with regard to the time of the incident.

On a perusal of the evidence, the contradictions inter se of the

prosecution witnesses is very obvious in this case. It is apparent that

the learned trial judge has failed to evaluate and analyse this evidence

in his judgment.

Thus, in the instant case it is not established that the only

irresistible and inescapable inference is that the appellant has

committed the crime.

12

When considering the totality of the evidence, it appears that the

learned trial judge has failed to evaluate the evidence in the correct

perspective and has disregarded the principles governing the reception

and evaluation of circumstantial evidence.

When an overall view of the evidence is taken, the only conclusion

that this Court can arrive at is, that the prosecution has failed to

establish the case beyond reasonable doubt.

Accordingly, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by

the learned High Court Judge of Panadura and acquit the accused

appellant. The appeal is therefore, allowed. The registrar is directed to

send a copy of this order with the original case record to the High Court

of Panadura.
