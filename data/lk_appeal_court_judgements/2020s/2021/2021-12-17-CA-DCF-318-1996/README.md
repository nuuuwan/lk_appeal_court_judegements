JUDGEMENT

Page 3 of 5

This Appeal emanates from the judgment in case No 2000/RE from Kandy District Court.

Plaintiff-Appellant filed a rent and ejectment case against the Defendants. According to the

Plaint, Meera Saibo Mohamed Thaha transferred allotment No. 2 in plan No. 1205 bearing

assessment No. 445 by deed No. 4479 dated 24.08.1981 to Plaintiff. When Plaintiff bought the

land, his predecessor had constructed a new building on the southern part of the land and had

given on rent to Munisamy. There was no question about the tenant-landlord relationship

between Meera Saibu Mohomad Thaha and Munisammy. Once Plaintiff bought the land, a

letter was sent on 11.06.1985. demanding Munisamy to vacate the premises. As Munisammy

passed away and the wife and children continued to occupy the premises without Plaintiff's

permission, another quit notice was sent to the successors of Munisamy on 17.09.1985.

The stand taken by the Appellant was that the wife and children of the said Munisamy are

unlawful occupants. The respondent refused that they were unlawful occupiers but sought the

relief under Rent Act.

Once the case came to the District Court, the trial proceeded on 28 issues. Withness was called,

and the learned judge entered the judgment on 19.03.1996. In the judgment, the judge had

stressed the importance of the time the building was built

According to the Rent Act, if the building were constructed after the 1st of January 1981, the

Rent Act would not be applicable. The learned judge had discussed this issue and answered

issue No. 16 in the affirmative. Even though issue No. 16 is somewhat different, and it is closer

to the meaning of whether the premises were built in or after 1980.

Another shortcoming in the judgment is the analysis of Defendant's knowledge of the change

of ownership. Plaintiff's case is that at the time of him becoming the owner, the tenant was the

husband of Defendant. When persuing P17 in the first cage, the tenant's name is Munisamy,

and the owner's name is Thangawel Thangaraja. In P18 the Defendant had admitted that K.

Munisammy was her husband.

The witness Anula Senadhipathi had given evidence regarding P17 as an official witness. By

their silence on this matter, the Defendants had accepted that Munisamy mentioned in P17 is

the same Munisamy who was the Plaintiff's tenant. Therefore the knowledge of ownership by

Page 4 of 5

the tenant is admitted. The conclusion that the learned judge had rejected the Plaint was that

Plaintiff had not established the owner and tenant relationship.

However, by P17, the knowledge of Munisammy was established. The present Defendant being

the wife of Musnisammy, who walks into the shoes of Munisammy, cannot deny the fact that

Plaintiff is the owner. If she rejects Plaintiff's ownership, she ceases to be Plaintiff's tenant and

becomes an unlawful occupier. By P17, Munisamy had accepted Plaintiff as Landlord. This

knowledge is an admission that Plaintiff had given notice. Defendant had admitted her husband

was the tenant of Thaha. He had given evidence establishing the fact that he sold the premises

to Plaintiff. Defendant, therefore, is the wife of the tenant. Therefore she is stopped by saying

anything contrary to her husband.

In giving evidence, Thaha predecessor in title admitted that Munisamy was his tenant and later

moved to the premises in question in 1980.

The learned District Judges judgment is set aside for the reasons discussed above. Issues are
