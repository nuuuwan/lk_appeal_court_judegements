In the instant applications for bail the two suspects namely,

S.A.RasangaVishwa and M NalakaDilip alias Army Nalaka were initially

taken into custody for being in possession of heroin less than one

gram by the Kiribathgoda police on 19.02 2020. While they were in

thepolice cell another B report had been filed stating that the two

suspects alleged that they would finish off those who falsely

implicated them.

The two suspects above named had been enlarged on bail for the

original charge but they had been remanded under the Assistance to

and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act, No. 4 of

2015.The position of the petitioners is that the exceptional

circumstances in this case are that,

1. At the time of the utterances by the suspects there were no

witnesses and as such it does not fall under the above mentioned act,

2. The investigative notes by the police are not in order and it carries

discrepancies,

3. There is a delay in concluding the investigations pertaining to the

matter in hand.

The respondents in their submissions in court admitted that there are

certain discrepancies in the investigative notes and that the delay in

concluding the investigation is also not denied.

The petitioners further submitted that the statements of the inmates

who were inside the cell at the time of the said utterances did not

implicate the suspects.

Therefore in view of the submissions made above this court is of the

opinion that the suspects in Bail Applications 22/20 and 23/20 should

be enlarged on the following conditions of bail,

1 Rs 25000/= cash bail each,

2 Two sureties to the value of Rs 50000/= each,

3 Each suspect should report to the office of the Assistant

Superintendent of police Kiribathgoda on every last Friday of the

month.
