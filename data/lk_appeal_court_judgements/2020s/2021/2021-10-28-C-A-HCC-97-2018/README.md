DECIDED ON : 28.10.2021

R. Gurusinghe, J.

The Accused-Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Kandy on a

charge of statutory rape under Section 364 (2) (e) of the Penal Code.

The appellant was convicted and sentenced to twelve years of rigorous

imprisonment and to a fine of Rs. 15,000/- with a default term of one-

year rigorous imprisonment. In addition, the appellant was ordered to

pay Rs. 250,000/- to the prosecutrix as compensation and in default of

which three years rigorous imprisonment.

In the written submissions of the appellant following grounds of appeal

were urged.

1. The evidence is not sufficient to prove the prosecution case.

2. The evidence of the appellant was wrongly rejected.

3. The contradictions and the omissions regarding the evidence of PW1

had not been considered.

4. The medical evidence had not been evaluated.

When this appeal was taken up for hearing, Counsel for the appellant

relied mainly on three grounds of appeal.

1. The evidence of the prosecution is not credible.

2. Delay in complaining.

3. When the evidence of the prosecutrix is not reliable, Court cannot

rely on circumstantial evidence.

3

The prosecutrix made a complaint to the Pundalu Oya Police Station on

17th August 2004, where she stated that the appellant had raped her a

few months back. At that time, she was fifteen years and four months

old. When she gave evidence before Court, she was a twenty-six years

old married woman having children. The learned Counsel for the

appellant pointed out several differences between the first complaint and

the evidence given in the Court by the prosecutrix.

The learned Senior State Counsel objected to this submission on the

basis that to use the statement made by the witness to the police, which

was not a part of the evidence, at this stage is wrong and contrary to law.

In the judgment of Punchi Mahaththaya Vs. the State 76 NLR page 564, a

Divisional Bench of the Court of the Appeal (at that time, the Court of

Appeal was a Higher Court than the Supreme Court) stated as follows:

"The Criminal Procedure Code [Section 122(3)] which enables such

statements to be sent for to aid a Court limits the exercise to course of

inquiry or trial. The Court of Criminal Appeal is neither a Court of

inquiry nor one of trial. At the stage of the Court of Criminal Appeal (or

for that matter, the Supreme Court on appeal) hears an appeal, both

inquiry and trial have been concluded. There would therefore appear to

be no justification for either the last mentioned two Courts to call for and

examine statements that formed no part of the evidence upon which the

verdict was returned".

In view of the above authority and in terms of the relevant provisions of

the Criminal Procedure Code Act, the Court of Appeal cannot compare

the evidence of witnesses with their statements to the police.

4

No contradiction or omission has been marked in the evidence of the

prosecutrix. Now, it is too late to point out contradictions or omissions

which were not marked or not drawn the attention of the Trial Court.

Therefore, the credibility of the prosecutrix now cannot be assailed by

comparing her statement to the police.

The next argument is that the complaint had been made after about five

or six months after the incident. There is indeed a delay in complaining.

However, the delay has been considered by the learned Trial Judge. The

Trial Judge has observed that the prosecutrix was fifteen years old at the

time of the incident. Further, he believed the evidence of the prosecutrix

that the appellant had threatened her. The trial Judge has considered

the evidence and accepted the explanation for the delay as plausible.

The learned High Court has observed that no contradiction or omission

has been marked in the evidence of the prosecutrix.

In the case of the State of Panjab Vs. Gurmit Singh and others 1996 AIR

1393 the Indian Supreme Court observed as follows:

"The courts must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the

fact that in a case of rape, no self-respecting woman would come

forward in a court just to make a humiliating statement against

her honour such as is involved in the commission of rape on her.

In cases involving sexual molestation, supposed considerations

which have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution

case or even discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix

should not, unless the discrepancies are such which are of fatal

nature, be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution

case. The inherent bashfulness of the females and the tendency to

conceal outrage of sexual aggression are factors which the Courts

should not over-look. The testimony of the victim in such cases is

5

vital and unless there are compelling reasons which necessitate

looking for corroboration of her statement, the courts should find

no difficulty to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault

alone to convict an accused where her testimony inspires

confidence and is found to be reliable. Seeking corroboration of her

statement before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases

amounts to adding insult to injury. Why should the evidence of a

girl of a woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation, be

viewed with doubt, disbelief or suspicion? The Court while

appreciating the evidence of a prosecutrix may look for some

assurance of her statement to satisfy its judicial conscience, since

she is a witness who is interested in the outcome of the charge

levelled by her, but there is no requirement of law to insist upon

corroboration of her statement to base conviction of an accused.

The evidence of a victim of sexual assault stands almost at par

with the evidence of an injured witness and to an extent is even

more reliable. Just as a witness who has sustained some injury in

the occurrence, which is not found to be self-inflicted, is

considered to be a good witness in the sense that he is least likely

to shield the real culprit, the evidence of a victim of a sexual

offence is entitled to great weight, absence of corroboration

notwithstanding. Corroborative evidence is not an imperative

component of judicial credence in every case of rape. Corroboration

as a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of the

prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a guidance of prudence

under given circumstances. It must not be over-looked that a

woman or a girl subjected to sexual assault is not an accomplice to

the crime but is a victim of another persons's lust and it is

improper and undesirable to test her evidence with a certain

amount of suspicion, treating her as if she were an accomplice."

6

Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer in Inder Singh & Anr. vs. The State (Delhi

Administration) (1978) 4 SCC 161 stated thus: -

"2. Credibility of testimony, oral and circumstantial, depends

considerably on a judicial evaluation of the totality, not isolated scrutiny.

While it is necessary that proof beyond reasonable doubt should be

adduced in all criminal cases, it is not necessary that it should be

perfect. If a case is proved too perfectly, it is argued that it is artificial; if

a case has some flaws, inevitable because human beings are prone to

err, it is argued that it is too imperfect. One wonders whether, in the

meticulous hypersensitivity to eliminate a rare innocent from being

punished, many guilty men must be callously allowed to escape. Proof

beyond reasonable doubt is a guideline, not a fetish, and guilty man

cannot go away with it because truth suffers some infirmity when

projected through human processes. Judicial quest for perfect proof

often accounts for police presentation of fool-proof concoction. Why fake

up? Because the Court asks for manufacture to make truth look true?

No, we must be realistic."

In Premasiri Vs. Attorney General [2006] 3 Sri Lanka Law Report 107,

Eric Basnayake J. held thus:

"The rule is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a

conviction in a case of rape, but the necessity of corroboration as a

matter of prudence, except where the circumstances make it unsafe to

dispense with it, must be present to the mind of the judge. (Schindra

Nath Biswas vs. State{B). In Sunil and another vs. the Attorney General

Dheeraratne J. with H. A. G. De Silva and Ramanathan JJ agreeing held

that "if the evidence of the complainant is so convincing, they could act

on that evidence alone, even in the absence of her evidence being

corroborated".

7

In this case, no contradiction or omission had been marked in the

evidence of the prosecutrix. There was no animosity between the family

of the prosecutrix and the appellant. And there was no motive to

implicate the appellant or to concoct a story against him. Even in the

evidence of the appellant, nothing has come out as a reason for false

implication. Learned High Court Judge has also considered the evidence

of the appellant. He has observed that the alleged assault on the

appellant was not informed to the Doctor or to the Magistrate. The

appellant stated in his evidence that he had informed his lawyer that the

police had assaulted him. The learned High Court Judge observed that if

this evidence is correct, his lawyer would have brought it to the attention

of the Magistrate. The learned High Court Judge has considered and

evaluated the evidence of the appellant. Therefore, the ground that the

evidence of the appellant was wrongly rejected has no merit.

Another ground of appeal is that the Trial Judge disregarded the medical

evidence. This ground was not urged at the hearing. The Doctor had

observed that the prosecutrix was pregnant, and the fetus was 25-27

weeks old by then. The Doctor was informed that a known person raped

her about five months back. Learned High Court Judge has considered

and evaluated the evidence. There was no basis for this ground of

appeal.

For the reasons set out above, we affirm the conviction.

The evidence reveals that there was a sort of consensus on the part of

the prosecutrix. She says that she knew the appellant from her infancy.

was before the incident.

She had asked the appellant to bring mangos and had eaten a mango

alone with the appellant in the kitchen. After the incident, the

prosecutrix had burned her bloodstained clothes and concealed the fact

from her parents. The incident was revealed only when her mother

questioned her after noticing the growing belly. All these facts lead to the

inference that the sexual intercourse had been consensual.

In S.C. Reference 03/2008, the Supreme Court stated that even though

the woman's consent was immaterial for the offence of rape when she is

under the age of 16 years, a woman's consent is relevant for a Court, in

the exercise of its discretion in deciding the sentence for such an offence.

Further, it was held that the Court is not inhibited from imposing a

sentence that it deems appropriate in the exercise of its judicial

discretion, notwithstanding the minimum mandatory sentence.

10

The appellant had no previous convictions. The appellant had made an

admission regarding the age of the prosecutrix and admitted her birth

certificate. Now he is a father of three children and the only person who

earns money to support his family.

Considering the above, we reduce the twelve-year jail term to five years

and further direct that the sentence is deemed to have been served from

the date of conviction, namely, 5th April 2018. The rest of the sentence is

not changed.

Subject to the variation of the sentence, the appeal is dismissed.
