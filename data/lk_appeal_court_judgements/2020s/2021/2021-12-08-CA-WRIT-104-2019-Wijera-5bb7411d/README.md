Sabrina Ahmed, SC for the 1st, 11A, 12A, 13A, 14th and 15th Respondents

Written submissions - tendered on behalf of Petitioners: 19.05.2021 and 25.10.2021

- tendered on behalf of Respondents: 10.11.2021

Decided on: 08.12.2021

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The 2nd Petitioner has filed this application on behalf of his daughter who is the 1st

Petitioner. The Petitioners seek, inter alia, for a mandate in the nature of a writ of

Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st to 14th Respondents not to admit the 1st Petitioner

to Grade 1 of the Southlands College, Galle. The Petitioners also seek for a mandate in

Page 5 of 12

the nature of a Mandamus compelling the Respondents to admit the said 1st Petitioner to

the Southlands College, Galle.

When this matter was taken up for argument, the Petitioners and the Respondents agreed

that this application be dealt with and determined solely on the basis of written

submissions and accordingly, Court afforded time for both parties to file written

submissions.

The 2nd Petitioner has submitted an application to the said Southlands College for the

admission of his daughter, the 1st Petitioner, to Grade 1 for the year 2019 to learn in

Sinhala medium. He has submitted the said application under the 'close proximity'

category in terms of the Notification marked P2 issued by the Ministry of Education on

31.05.2018. It is observed that the said P2 document which provides instructions related

to the admission of children to Grade 1 in Government schools for the year 2019 is based

on the circular No. 24/2018 issued by the Ministry of Education. The said circular No.

24/2018 is annexed to the amended statement of limited objections of the 1st & 11th to 13th

Respondents marked R1. The Petitioners, in paragraph 5 of their Petition have admitted

that the 2nd Petitioner had submitted the said application under the category of Residence-

Christian bearing CRC12 and further averse that the 1st Petitioner being a non-Roman

Catholic Christian, sought admission to the said school under the quota allocated to

Christian students. In terms of the application for admission to Grade 1 marked P4 & R6,

the Petitioners only preference was Southlands College, Galle.

The Petitioners submit that the Southlands College Galle was the closest non-Roman

Catholic Christian school to the 1st Petitioner according to the distance of location. The

Petitioners allege that the 1st Petitioner's name was not included in the selected list of

students for admission after the relevant interview. Subsequently an appeal has been made

by the Petitioners to the Appeal and Objection Investigation Board by which a decision

has been taken to reject the said Appeal.

The Petitioners complain that 40 marks had been deducted from 1st Petitioner's total mark

on the basis that there were 10 schools located from their residence to the school and the

said deduction of marks amounts to injustice on the basis that the Southlands College is

supposed to be the only Christian school (Non-Roman Catholic) in Galle educational zone

to teach Christianity subject. Furthermore, the Petitioners raise a claim in terms of clause

Page 6 of 12

4.2 of the said circular marked R1 (clause 3.2 of the circular marked P1) and submit that

the Respondents are under a legal duty to admit 6.9% non-Roman Catholic Christian

children, including the 1st Petitioner to the Southlands College to Grade 1 for the year

2019.

The first question that has to be examined relates to the basis upon which the alleged

deduction of marks has been made. The Petitioners contention is that in terms of clause

7.2.4 of the said circular (R1), 04 marks could be deducted for other government schools

within the radius only if such school admits 10% or more children of the religion to which

the child belongs. Further the Petitioner submits that the Respondents have failed to

establish that the 10 schools listed in amended statement of limited objections of the 1st &

11th to 13th Respondents, for which 40 marks have been deducted, admit 10% or more

Non-Roman Catholic Christian students.

In terms of clause 7.2.4 of the said circular R1 (clause 6.1 (III) of P1) the maximum marks

under the close proximity category shall be awarded only if the applicant's place of

residence is proved and if there are no other Government schools with primary sections

located closer to the place of residence than the school applied for. In the event of having

other Government schools with primary section for the admission of the child which are

closer to the place of residence than the school applied for, marks shall be deducted at the

rate of 04 marks from the maximum marks for each school.

The said clause further stipulates that other Government primary schools that the child

could be admitted implies, whether the school concerned has learning medium the child

has applied for / whether it is a girls or boys school or a mixed school appropriate for the

child and whether the school admits 10% or more children of the religion to which the

child belongs. (Emphasis added)

For the purpose of clarity, I have also drawn my attention to the Sinhala version of the

relevant portion in the circular which is as follows;

, ,

Page 7 of 12

10%

.

(Emphasis added)

The amended statement of limited objections of the 1st & 11th to 13th Respondents in its

paragraph 14 divulges the names of 12 schools that fall within the feeder area of the circle

drawn and shows that those schools have the capacity to admit 10% or more of Christian

students. The Respondents however submit that a school within the radius cannot be

considered for deduction of marks if such school, by a prerequisite in law or regulation, is

not required to admit more than 10% of students belonging to the religion of the child

seeking admission. Thus, it is pertinent here to examine the rationale behind the deduction

of marks for the schools that admit 10% or more children of the religion to which the child

belongs.

In this context, it is necessary to ascertain whether there is any provision in the said circular

R1 which requires to admit children on a percentage basis upon the religion of the child

seeking admission. It is noted that by virtue of clause 4.2 of the said circular R1, the

Ministry of Education has taken steps to maintain the ratio of student population, based

on their religious faith, that existed at the time of vesting such schools to the Government

under Assisted Schools and Training Schools (Special Provisions) Act, No. 05 of 1960 and

Assisted Schools and Training Schools (Supplementary Provisions) Act, No. 08 of 1961.

The religious percentage mentioned therein should be based on such percentage which

existed at the time the school was vested under the above Acts.

Shirani Bandranayake, C.J in M.K. Wijetunga & others v. The Principal, Southlands

College, Galle and others (SC/FR application 612/2004, decided on 07.11.2005) has

held that it is mandatory that the religious percentages that prevailed in 1961/62 to be

continued and the applicants who claimed that they are Christians had to be considered

in that background.

As mentioned above the Ministry of Education, as a policy, in terms of clause 4.2 of the

said circular R1, has taken necessary measures to maintain the ratio of student population

based on their religious faith that existed at the time of vesting of such school in

1960/1961. The Ministry of Education as a policy may impose any other rule or regulation

Page 8 of 12

also apart from the provisions of the said clause 4.2 in view of regulating admission of

children. However, information to that effect has not been provided to this Court either

by the Petitioners or by the Respondents of this application.

All Government schools in the country do not fall in to the category of vested schools

under the above Acts1. Therefore, in my view, the schools that have not been vested under

the provisions of the said Acts, are not required to restrict any child being admitted,

provided that the learning medium and the gender of the child is compatible to the

respective school and however, subject to the other provisions of the annual admission

circular. If an Assisted school that vested under the said Acts is located within the close

proximity to Petitioners residence, then marks can be deducted provided the ratio that is

required to be maintained as per the said clause 4.2 is higher than 10% of the children of

the particular religion to which the child belongs. However, no marks could be deducted

in respect of such vested school if the required ratio is lesser than 10%.

The Director National Schools (13A Respondent) has affirmed by a way of an affidavit

that none of the schools upon which the marks have been deducted are bound by any

restrictions based on religious criteria in respect of Christian students for admission to

Grade 1. He has annexed a supporting document marked X1 to establish that those 10

schools (upon which the marks have been deducted) had no quota restriction upon

admission of Christian students. According to the said Affidavit of the 13A Respondent,

it is apparent that these 10 schools are not vested schools under the said Acts. The reasons

adduced above emanates that those 10 schools admit or have the capacity to admit even

children of non-Roman Catholic Christians (the religion of the 1st Petitioner) without any

hindrance, restriction or limitation and without maintaining a minimum or maximum

percentage.

However, the Petitioners contention is that the Respondents have failed to establish that

the aforesaid 12 schools upon which a maximum of 40 marks were deducted from the 1st

Petitioner has in fact admitted 10% or more non-Roman Catholic Christian children over

the past few years. The Petitioners further argue that the Southland College is supposed to

1 Assisted Schools and Training Schools (Special Provisions) Act, No. 05 of 1960 and Assisted Schools and Training Schools (Supplementary Provisions) Act, No. 08 of 1961

Page 9 of 12

be the only Christian school (non-Roman Catholic) in Galle educational zone to teach

Christianity.

A careful examination of clause 7.2.4 of the said circular indicates that there is no

requirement of teaching the subject of Christianity or any other specific subject in the

respective school in order to deduct marks under such provisions of the circular. The

framers of the circular have concentrated only on the fact whether such school admits 10%

or more of the religion to which the child belongs. In other words, the intention of the said

clause is to ascertain whether a respective school has any restriction by law or a by way of

a regulation to admit children. However, the fact as to whether the respective school, at

the time of applying for admission, teaches a particular subject is not a specification per se

under that clause to deduct marks. Whereas, there seems to be no necessity to have 10%

or more children of the religion to which the child belongs, physically studying in a

respective school, in order to deduct marks under said clause 7.2.4. Moreover, I am of the

view that, if there are no restrictions by law or by any other regulation in respect of

admission of children as explained above, the respective schools should provide facilities

to whoever the applicants seeking admission irrespective of their religion.

The Respondents in their limited statement of objections have categorically stated that all

schools are required to provide religious education to children of all

religions/denominations based on requirements. Anyhow, such duty of the State to teach

any religion at Government schools is eventually subject to limitations and requirements

introduced in above clause 4.2 of the circular R1. The learning medium of the respective

school and the fact whether it is a girls or boys school or a mixed school also material to

the child who seeks admission.

In Shahul Majeed Mohomed Rizwan and another vs. Sampath Weragoda, The

Principal of Richmond College (SC/FR Application No. 292/2018, SC minutes

09.10.2019), the issue raised before the Supreme Court was that Paramananda Maha

Vidyalaya and CWW Kannangara Vidyalaya are not schools that can admit 10% or more

children of the Islamic faith and therefore, deduction of marks for the said two schools

under sub-clause 7.2.3 of the admission circular dated 30.05.2017 (similar to clause 7.2.4

of the circular R1 in the instant application) violates Petitioners Fundamental Rights.

Her Ladyship Justice Murdu N.B. Fernando held in the said case as follows;

Page 10 of 12

The number of children or the percentage of the children of Islamic Faith actually admitted

during the last few years is not material and is not the issue. What the Petitioner should

establish before this Court, is that there is a regulation or a rule that the school, being a

Government School can admit only less than 10% of children belonging to the Islamic faith

or that there are restrictions placed on the said school with regard to admissions or the said

school can admit only a particular number of children of a particular faith or a particular

percentage of children belonging to a particular faith. For instance, like the situation referred

to in Clause 4.2 of the Admission Circular (P1) pertaining to schools vested with the

Government under Assisted Schools and Training Schools (Special Provisions) Act No 05 of

1960 and Assisted Schools and Training Schools (Supplementary Provisions) Act No 08 of

1961.

The rationale adopted by the Supreme Court in the above case is very much relevant to

the issue of the instant application. Accordingly, I see no reason to annul the decision of

the Respondents to deduct marks in respect of the 10 schools mentioned in this case.

In view of my above findings, I cannot accept the proposition of the Petitioners;

i. that no marks could be deducted since those 10 schools do not teach Christianity

as a subject; and

ii. that no non-Roman Catholic Christian students have been admitted to those

schools during recent past.

Now I advert to the Petitioners second main argument which enumerates that, the

Respondents are under a legal duty to accept 6.9% non-Roman Catholic Christian children

including the 1st Petitioner to the Southlands College, since it is a vested school under the

Acts mentioned above. In the aforesaid case of M.K. Wijethunga and others vs. The

Principal Southlands College, Galle (SC/FR Application 612/2004, decided on

07.11.2005) the Supreme Court observed, in terms of the extracts of the proceedings of

the Methodist Church Synod held at Scotthold, Colpetty in January 1969 that there had

been 53 Christian students out of the total of 760 students at Southlands College.

Therefore, the percentage of Christians in Southlands as at 1969 was 6.9%.

The 12th Respondent, The Secretary to the Ministry of Education in paragraph 10 of his

Affidavit has clearly given the following breakdown of the students who were to be

Page 11 of 12

admitted to school in respect of various categories in terms of clause 4.2 of the said circular

R1;

No. of Christian Students

i. Residents Category (RC) 50% 222 x 50/100 x 6.9% = 7.76

ii. Past Pupil (PP) 25% 222 x 25/100 x 6.9% = 3.825

iii. Brother/ Sister of studying (SR) 15% 222 x 15/100 x 6.9% = 2.297

iv. Children of Staff (S) 5% 222 x 5/100 x 6.9% = 0.7659

v. Annual Transfers (TR) 4% 222 x 4/100 x 6.9% = 0.612

vi. Abroad Category (FR) 1% 222 x 1/100 x 6.9% = 0.153

The above breakdown and the relevant marksheets annexed to the pleadings of the

Respondents show that the required quota of Christian students, under all above categories

has been met by the 1st to 5th Respondents. Furthermore, the breakdown of the number of

Christian students who were to be admitted to Southlands College in terms of law is as

follows; (vide - paragraph 11 of the said Affidavit of the 12th Respondent)

Mandatory intake of

Christians in terms of

law

Christian intake for the

year of 2019 in the

Southlands Galle

i. (R.C.) 07 11

ii. (P.P) 03 02

iii. (S.R.) 02 02

iv. (Staff) 01 00

v. (T.R) 01 00

vi. (F.R.) --- 00

vii. Forces --- 01

Total 15 16

Thus, the Respondents were to admit total of 222 of students to Grade 1 for the year 2019,

out of which 6.9% were required to be Christian students. Accordingly, the required

number for the admission for Christian students were 15. Hence, I am of the view that the

Page 12 of 12

Respondents have properly considered the provisions of clause 4.2 of the circular R1 when

admitting children to Grade 1 at Southlands College, Galle.

In the circumstances, I hold that the Petitioners are not entitled to seek for a mandate in

the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions of the Respondents not to admit

the 1st Petitioner to Grade 1 of Southlands College, Galle. A writ of Mandamus can be

issued only if a decision is reached on the basis of irrelevant consideration or improper

purposes (vide - P.P Craig, Administrative Law-5th Edition page 768) and therefore, the

relief sought by the Petitioners for a writ of Mandamus also cannot be granted.

I proceed to dismiss this application. No order is made with regard to costs.
