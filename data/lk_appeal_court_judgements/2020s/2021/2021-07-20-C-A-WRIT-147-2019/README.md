The Petitioners filing the Petition dated 1st April 2019, have sought, inter alia, for a writ of

certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st to 3rd Respondents to conduct an inquiry on the

purported basis of "short delivery" or "short landing" of cargo on the voyage from 27th

December 2018 to 21st January 2019. The Petitioners have further sought an interim

order preventing the 1st to 3rd Respondents, from seizing and/or arresting the vessel NT

Splendore until the final determination of the said application. Subsequently, the

Petitioner filed an amended Petition dated 30th August 2019 mainly seeking for a writ of

certiorari quashing the illegal seizure as set out in the purported letter and/or notice

marked P20, dated 13th June 2019. Therefore, the Petitioner is now challenging the said

notice of seizure which clearly indicates that 162.257MT of IFO 380CST has been

seized in terms of Section 135 of Customs Ordinance for the purpose of investigation.

Accordingly, it is clear that the subject goods have been seized by the Sri Lanka

Customs by the said seizure notice for the purpose of investigation.

When this matter was taken up before this court for support, for issuance of notice, on

17th February 2021 the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the 1st

to 3rd Respondents informed court that the Sri Lanka Customs would commence an

inquiry to investigate the matter relating to the aforesaid seizure. On the same day, the

learned Counsel who appeared for the Petitioners indicated to court, that he would

inform court as to whether the application of the Petitioner would be withdrawn pending

such an inquiry. On 10th March 2021 the learned Counsel for the Petitioner informed this

court that the application of the Petitioner will not be withdrawn, and subsequently the

matter was taken up for support for notice, on 1st April 2021.

The Petitioners, as per paragraph 43 of the amended Petition, complain that;

(i)the said seizure is per se illegal and irrational for the reason that the cargo so

seized was not liable to be forfeited which is a necessary precondition for any

seizure of cargo;

Page 4 of 5

(ii)the 1st and 2nd Respondents seized goods that they could not do so under any

circumstances, even if the Petitioners are liable for short delivery, as forfeiture

is not a penal consequence of short delivery;

(iii)seizure under Section 135 of the Customs Ordinance is in respect of goods

forming the subject matter of a Customs Ordinance violation, whereas the

goods seized are not such goods as the goods seized were shipped on an

entirely different voyage from the voyage subject to the investigation.

In the case of Dias v Director General of Customs, 2001 3 SLR 281 (CA), the Court

held that "the notice of seizure is not a final determination, and the scheme of the

Customs Ordinance recognizes and gives an opportunity to the person whose goods

are seized to vindicate himself at a subsequent inquiry. Court would interfere only if the

statutory procedure laid down is insufficient to achieve justice. There is nothing wanting

in that procedure set out in the Customs Ordinance."

The Petitioner's main argument in the instant case, as mentioned above, is that the '

seizure under Section 135 of the Customs Ordinance is in respect of goods forming the

subject matter of a Customs Ordinance violation, whereas the goods seized are not

such goods'.

The Court of Appeal in Thajudeen v. Sri Lanka Tea Board and another 1981 2 SLR

471 has referred to CHOUDRI in his book on the Law of Writs and Fundamental Rights

(2nd Edition) Vol.2 (at p.381) and highlighted that "where the facts are in dispute and in

order to get at the truth it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in a suit

where parties would have ample opportunity of examining their witnesses..".

In the case above the court has further observed that, "the remedy by way of an

application for a writ is not proper substitute for a remedy by way of a suit, specially

where facts are in dispute and in order to get at the truth, it is necessary that the

questions should be canvassed in a suit where the parties would have ample

opportunity examining their witnesses and the Court would be better able to judge which

version is correct, has been laid down in the Indian cases of Ghosh v. Damodar Valley

Page 5 of 5

Corporation, AIR 1953 Cal. 581 and Parraju v. General Manager B.N. Rly. AIR 1952

Cal. 610..

Therefore, this court takes the view that the questions raised by the Petitioners can be

easily and effectively canvassed at the inquiry which is to be held at the Sri Lanka

Customs. Even if the court decides to issue notice in this matter the court will have to

determine the legality of the relevant decisions only upon the averments contained in

the Petition. However, the facts disclosed in the averments of the Petition are in dispute

and those facts are going to be investigated by another forum/tribunal. This court is

unable to decide the legality of those decisions without going into questions of fact

involved in this case. Accordingly, the Petitioners have made a premature application

before this court and have failed to establish a prima facie case.

In the circumstances, we refuse to issue notice and dismiss this application.
