A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J. (PICA)

The succinct issue that arises in this ase is whether the registration of the institution

known as Herbal Holiday Resorts Pvt. Ltd (the Appellant) must be effected under the

Ayurveda Act, No. 13 of 1961 as am~nded (the Ayurveda Act) in order to become

entitled to the benefit of a tax exem tion under the Value Added Tax Act, No.l4 of

2002 (the VAT Act). The tax exemp >ion which is set out in paragraph (b) item (xii)

of Part II of the First Schedule of the AT Act goes as follows:

"All health care services prOVided by the medical institutions or professionally qualified

persons providing such care"

It is quite clear from the above that te supply of health care services is exempt from

VAT. The exemption from VAT a,lies to the supply of all health care services

provided by;

i. Medical institutions; or

ii. Professionally qualified persr s providing such care.

The crux of the argument of the learj ed Senior Deputy Solicitor General was that no

exemption from VAT liability could be granted when there is a finding that the

Appellant had no registration underl the Ayurveda Act. If I may put the question in

another way I would summarize the rgument as follows:

"Wh"h~ '" =mp,;" from VA~ Ii,b;li~ m,ld "or b, "",ud if ,h, i""M',, " '"

registered under the Ayurveda ACT

The learned Counsel for the State contended that the Ayurvedic services provided by

the Appellant were not registered under the Ayurveda Act and therefore the

exemption could not be granted.

Before I proceed to assay these argurents let me advert to the determination of the

Tax Appeals Commission dated 29.1p0l6. The determination at page 6 deals with a

question of law on which both t ounsel for the Appellant Company and the

2

Respondent Commissioner General of Inland Revenue made submissions before this

court on the case stated. The materia! holding of the Tax Appeals Commission goes as

follows:

"We are of the view that the regis ration with the Department of Ayurveda is a mandatory

requirement and that would be the best evidence to prove the existence of a medical

institution for V AT exemption. Ir this regard, we examined the registration certificates

produced by the Appellant compar- According to the certificates issued by the Department

of Ayurveda the Appellant has beer registered as a medical institution to provide Ayurvedic

treatment under the Ayurveda Act, No. 13 of 1961 in 2015. Hence, it is evident that the

taxable periods 2009/2010 and 2~1O/2011 were not covered by the said registration under

the Department of Ayurveda."

Thus a mandatory registration underjthe A yurveda -.Act has b~en insist.::d upon By the .

Tax Appeals Commission in order 0 claim a VAT exemption under item (xii) of

paragraph (b) of Part II of the First Schedule to the VAT Act.

I have to interpose here and observe that in terms of the VAT exemption provided for

in item (xii) of paragraph (b) of Part II of the First Schedule to the VAT Act, the

exempt supply of health care services must be by a medical institution or

professionally qualified persons and F the instant case stated, the question whether

the Appellant operates a medical institution that supplies health care has never been

disputed by the Commissioner Gen~ral of Inland Revenue before the Tax Appeals

Commission. I would further add tha~ the Tax Appeals Commission has not reached a

finding on any evidence led before it that the Appellant has not maintained a medical

institution.

I find that there was evidence before the Tax Appeals Commission that there were

qualified Ayurvedic doctors in the hbliday center tun by the Appellant to attend to

the guests who patronized the AJrveda services. As was brought forth in the

arguments before this court, no dispute has been raised either before the

3

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue or the Tax Appeals Commission regarding

the qualifications of Ayurvedic ddctors and the validity of their registration to

practice Ayurveda. .

Since there was no dispute or issue ~efore either of the two tiers as to the status of the

Appellant's services as a medical institution, it goes without saying that issue cannot

arise before this court. It has to be ~emembered that the jurisdiction of the Court of

Appeal in a case stated is to determ1e questions of law arising from questions of fact

placed before the Tax Appeals Commission. Though there is no finding by the Tax

Appeals Commission that the Appef ant does not operate a medical institution, the

Tax Appeals Commission has brou&ht in what it calls a mandatory requirement of

registration under the Ayurveda Act,1 as an ingredient or a requirement to be qualified

to seek a VAT exemption.

Nowhere does one find registrati01 as a mandatory requirement in the exempting

provision namely, item (xii) of parar raph (b) of part II in the First Schedule of the

Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of20021as amended.

In a nutshell, the VAT exemption, as I have alluded to above, is available in the

follOwing situations:

1.

11.

all health care services provided by medical institutions; and

health care services by professi6nally qualified persons.

Nowhere does the exempting prJvision III the VAT Act impose an express

requirement of a registration under tre Ayurveda Act, No. 13 of 1961. As I have clearly

adverted to, there is no dispute as to the health care services prOvided by the medical

institution. Whilst the exempting prOviSiOn did not require a registration, the Tax

Appeals Commission read into the V AT Act a mandatory requirement of registration

when it went on to hold:

4

"Therefore, we are of the view that the registration with the Department of Ayurveda is a

mandatory requirement... .. " J

Though registration under the Ayu eda Act was not expressly provided for in the

exempting provision, namely item tXii) of paragraph (b) of part II in the First

Schedule of the Value Added Tax A+ No. 14 of 2002 as amended, the Tax Appeals

Commission read the requirement a, an implied stipulation into the provision. This

appears to be contrary to precedents r d rules of interpretation in fiscal statutes.

In the Indian case of Bechu Companr v. Assistant Commissioner 2003 STC (132) 68

the validity of certain newly amended provisions of the Kerala General Sales Tax Act,

1963, were challenged. The said proVil ions treated brand name holders and trademark

holders, who effected sale of manu actured goods under a brand name or a trade

name, as a separate class for point 0 levy of tax under the Act. Tile provisions were

challenged by trade mark holders aJ

brand name holders who were not registered

under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. The court held in this regard that

to restrict the application of the Act 0 only those trade mark and brand name holders

who were registered under the Trade Marks Act would amount to reading words into

the taxing statute which was irnpe missible. In other words the court held that a

requirement of registration could not be read into the Act. The use of the words brand

name holders and trade mark holders would not be restricted to only registered brand

holders and trade mark holders. It ould include unregistered brand name holders

and trade mark holders. The court 0

"It is settled that interpreting a txing statute, eqUitable considerations are entirely out of

place. Nor can taxing statutes be i terpreted on any presumptions or assumptions. The court

must look squarely at the words 0 Ithe statute and interpret them. It must interpret a taxing

statute in the light of what is clearly expressed: it cannot imply anything which is not

expressed; it cannot import provisions in the statutes so as to supply any assumed

defiCiency. "

In Fihn Exhibiters Guild v. State of Andlu-a Pradesh AIR 1987 AP no the court had

to consider whether the proprietor of a Cinema Theatre, on agreeing to pay

entertainment tax under Section 5v of the Andhra Pradesh Entertainment Tax Act,

1939, was also liable to pay show-tax under Section 4-A of the Act (inserted by an

amendment in 1984). The court held that since Section 4-A was clear in its mandate

of imposing show tax on those who were covered under Section 5 it could not be

interpreted in a manner that defeated the clear intention of the legislature to impose

an additional tax. The court observed:

"A taxing statute, if it professes ~o impose a charge, its intention must be expressed in clear,

unequivocal and unambiguous Idnguage. The court has to look at the language couched. A

hunt into intention to find a charge is impermissible. No equitable construction of a charging

section is to be applied. The charging section is to be construed strictly regardless of its

consequences that may appear to 'the judicial mind to be. The burden is on the state to show

that the subject is within the prorisions of the Act. However, in construing the machinery

provisions for assessment and collection of the tax to make the machinery workable ut res

valeat petius quam pereat, that is, the court would avoid that construction which

would fail to relieve the manifest purpose of the legislation on the presumption that the

legislature would enact only for the purpose of bringing about an effective result. It is not the

Junction of the court to hunt out ambiguities by strained and unnatural meaning, close

reasoning is to be adapted; harmqnious construction is to be adhered to; all the relevant

provisions are to be read togethef to gather the intention from the language employed, its

context, and give effect to the intention of the legislature. IngeniOUS attempt to avoid tax is to

be thwarted."

These cannons of interpretation are consonant with the articulations of Rowlatt, J. in

Cape Brandy Syndicate v. Inland Revenue Commissioners (1921) 1 KB 64 (at page

71)/12 TC 358 at page 366

6

''In a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly said. There is no room for any

intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There is no presumption as to a tax. Nothing is

to be read in, notiling is to be implied and subsequent legislation, if it proceeded on

an erroneous construction of previous legislation, cannot alter the previous legislation."

I This leading principle was affirmed by the English Court of Appeal in (1921) 2 KB

403. The learned Counsel for the Apellant has brought to the notice of this court the

following English cases that have followed the principle enunciated in Cape Brandy

Syndicate v. Inland Revenue Commissioners (supra)' to wit; Sdection Trust Ltd.

v. Devitt (Inspector of Taxes) [1945] 2 All ER 499 (HL) at 506,507; Amerada Hess

Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commidsioners [2000] STC 397 at page 402; Jaggers

(Trading at Shide Trees) v. Ellis (Inspector of Taxes) [1996] STC (SCD) 440 at

page 444 and Johnson (Inspector of Taxes) v. The Prudential Assurances Co. Ltd.

[1996] STC 647 at page 66S.

In Sri Lanka the principle enujbated by Rowlatt, ]. has been followed in

Nanayakkara v. University of Pera'deniya (1991) 1 SrLLR 97; Trust Union Shipping

Corporation v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (2003) 3 SrLLR 43; The

Manager, Bank of Ceylon, Hatt~n v. The Secretary Hatton Dickoya Urban '

Council (2005) 3 SrLLR 1; and Vallibd Lanka (Pvt.) limited v. Director General of

Customs and three others (200S) 1 SrLLR 219.

Sripavan, ]. (President of the Court of Appeal) as His Lordship was then with the

concurrence of Rohini Perera, ]. echoed the consistent principle in Kalamazoo

Systems Ltd v. The Commissioner feneral of Labour and 6 Others 2002 B.LR 164

that nothing is to be read in and nothing is to be implied into fiscal legislation.

So the Tax Appeals Commission was in error when it introduced the requirement of a

mandatory registration of medical in9titutions into item (xii) of paragraph (b) of part

II in the First Schedule of the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002 as amended and

7

for this reason I proceed to answer in the negative the following material question of

law formulated for the opinion of this court:

Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law in deciding that medical institutions providing

Ayurveda Health Care service reqUire a registration under the Ayurveda Act, No. 31 of1961 in

order to be entitled for exemptionl under item (xii) of paragraph (b) of part 11 in the First

Schedule of the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of2002 as amended?

In other words in order to secure the VAT exemption in the instant case, there is no

mandatory requirement of a regiftration of the medical institution under the

Ayurveda Act and in view of this ho~ding, I need not go into another contention of the

learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General that non registration under the Ayurveda Act

exposes the medical institution to criminal prosecution. It is as plain as a pikestaff

just as much an alleged illegality of income or profit will not extinguish tax liability,

such an alleged taint in the supply i f goods or services cannot deny exemption if the

exemption has been unambiguously ~rovided for in the fiscal statute. For purposes of

VAT, it is either liable supply or exempt supply.

As regard registration, the attention of this court was drawn to section 10 (1) of the

Ayurveda Act which reads as follows:

"No premises shall be used for the purposes of an ayurvedic hospital, ayurvedic pharmacy,

ayurvedic dispensary or ayurvedic store, unless such premises are for the time being registered

by the Commissioner as an ayurvedic hospital, ayurvedic pharmacy, ayurvedic dispensary or

ayurvedic store, as the case may be, and the person carrying on such hospital, pharmacy,

dispensary or store in such premises is for the time being registered by the Commissioner as the

proprietor thereof"

8

.

)

Section 10(1) above applies only to the following institutions, namely,

a) ayurvedic hospital;

b) ayurvedic pharmacy;

c) ayurvedic dispensary; and

d) ayurvedic store.

Thus it is clear that it is only ooen a person operates one of these four institutions

without registration, an offense under section 10(1) of the Ayurveda Act is likely to be

committed.

It has to be noted that the Department of Ayurveda has registered the Appellant as an

"institute of Private Ayurvedic Service." The following certificates demonstrate this

position:

a) Certificate dated 23.02.2011 to provide "Panchakararna" services with effe~t

from 14022100.

a) Certificate dated 31.10.2012 to provide "Ayurveda Panchakararna" services and

Ayurveda massage services with effect from 14.02.2012.

b) Certificate dated 30.09.2015 to provide Ayurveda treatment, "Ayurveda

Panchakararna" treatment an~ Ayurveda massage treatments with effect from

01.10.2015.

It is therefore evident that the Appellant does not fall under the aforesaid four

categories ooich become liable for prosecution.

In any event a prospective prosecutibn for non registration under the Ayurveda Act

will not deprive a medical institution of losing the tax exemption ooen it satisfies the

threshold of a medical institution ooich provides health care services.

--

Accordingly I take the view that bqth the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

and the Tax Appeals Commission arrived at erroneous conclusions in regard to V A T

exemption and this court reiterates that the question of law as regards the

entitlement of the Appellant to V AT exemption for the relevant periods must be

answered in its favour.
