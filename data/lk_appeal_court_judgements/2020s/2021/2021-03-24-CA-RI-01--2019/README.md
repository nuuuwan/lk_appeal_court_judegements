Defendants Respondents Kirtisinghe - J

The Plaintiff Petitioner has filed this application for Restitutio - in -Integrum to set

aside/ Vacate the settlement recorded on 13.03.2018 in the District Court of Tangalle and restore the parties to the status quo ante or in the alternative to set

aside/ vacate the settlement pertaining to the additional condition recorded on

that day.

The Petitioner was the Manager of the two schools managed by the 1st Respondent

society and 2,3 and 4 Defendants Respondents were the President, Secretary, and

Vice President of the 1't Respondent society. It is the case of the Petitioner that the

Respondents had made an attempt to hold the Annual General Meeting of the society with the participation of a group of people who had been granted the membership of the society unlawfully in the previous year. Thereafter the Petitioner had sought for an interim injunction from the District Court of Tangalle preventing same. Earlier the Petitioner had instituted action No. SPL 417 in the District Court of Bandarawela for a similar Purpose. The District Court of Tangalle

had issued an enjoining order in the first instance and issued notice of interim injunction on the Respondents. Thereafter the Petitioner and the Respondents were negotiating with the view of reaching a settlement with regard to the holding of the Annual General Meeting of the 1't Respondent society and these

negotiations had led the Petitioner and the Respondents to the conclusion that the two cases pending in the District Court of Tangalle and the District Court of

Bandarawela were an obstacle to making progress in their effort to resolve the

dispute amicably. Therefore the Petitioner and the Respondents had agreed not to proceed with the two cases. When this case had come up in the District Court of Tangalle on 13.03.2018 the agreement reached by the parties was placed before Court and the Petitioner had moved to withdraw the case on the condition that the

3

Respondents undertake to withdraw their claim in reconvention in the Badarawela

case.

The proceedings on 13.03.2018 reads as follows;

The Petition er states that he came to know later that at the time of the aforesa id settlement was recorded the Attorney -at- Law for the Respondents had introduced an additional condition to which the Attorney -at -Law for the

Petitioner had expressed his agreement by mistake.

That additional condition and the proceedings thereafter read as follows;

The Petitioner states that the aforementioned additional condition was not a part of the agreement arrived at between the parties and the Attorney - at - Law for the Petitioner had expressed his consent to that condition purely by mistake. The

Petitioner did not, at any stage, instructed his Attorney - at - Law to consent to that additional condition. The Petitioner says that although he signed the case

record after recording the settlement, he was unaware and was unable to comprehend that such an additional condition had been included in the settlement

as he was blind. The Petitioner states that the Respondents were aware that the Attorney - at - Law for the Petitioner was making a mistake as that additional

condition was not a part of the agreement reached by the parties.

In the case of Cornelius Perera vs. Leo Perera 62 NLR 413, Basnayake CJ held that on the ground of mistake, a consent order and the judgement based on it can be set aside. Sansoni J held that the proper remedy is by way of an application for restitutio in integrum. In the case of Halib Abdul Cader Ameer vs. Danny Perera 1998 (2) SLR 321, G.P.S. De Silva CJ held that the District Court has no jurisdiction to set aside a decree entered by consent of parties on the basis of "Justus error"

committed by a party in consenting to the terms of the settlements. However restitutio in integrum can be claimed on the ground of "Justus error" which constitutes reasonable or excusable error. It was also held that the remedy by way of restitutio in integrum is an extra ordinary remedy and is given only under very exceptional circu mstances.

The Petitioner has taken up the position that the settlement pertaining to the additional condition recorded is not in compliance with the provisions of the section 408 of the civil procedure code.

Section 408 of the civil procedure code reads as follows;

408. If an action be adjusted whol ly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise, or if the defendant satisfy the plaintiff in respect to the whole or any part of the matter of the action, such agreement, compromise, or satisfaction shall

be notified to the court by motion made in presence of, or on notice to, all the parties concerned, and the court shall pass a decree in accordance therewith, so

5

far as it relates to the action, and such decree shall be final, so far as relates to so

much of the subject matter of the action as is dealt with by the agreement, compromise, or satisfaction.

Section 91 of the civil procedure code reads as follows;

91. Every application made to the court in the course of an action, incidental thereto, and not a step in the regular procedure, shall be made by motion by the applicant in person or his advocate or proctor, and a memorandum in writing of such motion shall be at the same time delivered to the court.

Section 408 of the civil procedure code requires the parties to notify the agreement, or compromise to court by motion and section 91 of the code requires

that a memorandum in writing of every motion should be delivered to court at the time it is made. The procedure adopted in this case in the District Court at the time

the settlement was recorded does not satisfy the requirements of section 408. In

his order the learned District Judge has stated as follows;

That shows that the written terms of settlement were not before court at the time the settlement was recorded and the parties had not tendered to court a

memorandum in writing containing the terms of settlement. Therefore even if the consent given by the counsel for the Plaintiff Petitioner to include the disputed additional condition into the terms of settlement had not been vitiated by a mistake of fact the consent decree entered in terms of that arrangement will not

attract the finality given to the decree passed under section 408 of the code. As stated by Basnayake CJ in Cornelius Perera vs Leo Perera 62 NLR 413 "Where a statute provides special machinery which if resorted to renders a decree final, the

finality prescribed in the Act does not attach to a decree unless there is a clear

manifestation of a conscious intension of the parties to resort to that machinery with a knowledge of the consequences it involves and there has been a strict compliance with the requirements of the statute." Parties to this case had not

complied with the imperative requirements of section 408 of the civil procedure code and therefore the consent decree entered in the District Court will not attract the finality given to decrees passed under the section 408 of the civil procedure code. Therefore this settlement can be set aside on that ground alone.

The Roman Dutch Law enables a person to avoid an agreement or settlement for mistake on his part when the mistake is an essential and reasonable one. In the

case of Cornelius Perera vs Leo Perera cited above Sansoni J states thus "it must

be essential in the sense that there was a mistake as to the person with whom he

was dealing (error in persona) or as to the nature or subject matter of the transaction (error in negotio, error in corpore). A mistake is regard to incidental

matters is not enough. The test of reasonableness is satisfied if the person shows either (1) that the error was induced by the fraudulent or innocent misrepresentation of the other party, or (2) that the other party knew, or a

reasonable person should have known, that a mistake was being made, or (3) that the mistake was, in all the circumstances, excusable (Justus et probabilis error) even

where there was absence of misrepresentation or knowledge on the part of the other party. An agreement entered into in the course of an action, like any other agreement, may be set aside on these grou nds".

In this case the mistake committed is an essential one as it relates to the nature or subject matter of the settlement. Before coming to the test of reasonableness it is

appropriate to take into consideration the following opinion expressed by Burnside

CJ in the case of Phillippu vs Ferdinands (1892 (1) Matara cases 207). "And I should

hold that any admission which might be made for the defendants attempting to bind them to their manifest prejudice in the very essence of the defence on their pleadings and contrary to their contention on their evidence would not bind them without shewing that they had expressly authorized their counsel to make it and with a full knowledge of its effect".

According to the contents of the additional condition submitted on behalf of the

defendants and incorporated into the settlement the Plaintiff Petitioner had agreed to accept the new office bearers that will be elected at the Annual General Meeting with the participation of all the members who had become members of the society in 2017. That agreement completely cuts across the Plaintiff's case. The

plaintiff had come to court to prevent the Respondents from holding the Annual General Meeting with the participation of the members who had been granted

membership unlawfully in 2017. While the case was pending the Plaintiff Petitioner and the Defendant Respondents were negotiating to arrive at an amicable settlement and those negotiations are still continuing. The Plaintiff Petitioner had decided to withdraw the action pending in the District Court because both the

7

Plaintiff and the Defendants had thought that this case was an obstacle to making progress in their effort to resolve the dispute amicably. Therefore it is highly

improbable that the Plaintiff Petitioner would have agreed to accept the additional condition incorporated into the settlement. Therefore on a balance of probability of the evidence one can accept the version of the Plaintiff Petitioner that the Attorney - at - Law who represented him had acted contrarily to authority as the

additional condition was not a part of the agreement entered into between the parties and that the Attorney - at - Law for the Plaintiff Petitioner had consented to this additional condition purely by mistake. When one examines the content of the proceedings on 13.03.2018 it is apparent that the additional condition had been

incorporated into the settlement subsequently. It was not a part of the original

settlement. After the terms of the original settlement were recorded the Attorney

- at - Law for the Defendants has made an attempt to incorporate these additional terms into the settlements as an additional condition. That clearly shows that it was

not a part of the original settlement. The learned counsel for the Defendant Respondents has conceded in this court that the disputed additional condition was not in the original agreement. Therefore one can come to the conclusion on a

balance of probabilities that the Defendants Respondents new, or a reasonable person should have known, that a mistake was being made. That mistake was excusable even where there was absence of knowledge on the part of the

Respondents. Therefore the disputed additional condition incorporated into the settlement can be set aside on these grounds.

For the aforesaid reasons we set aside the settlement/ Compromise pertaining to the disputed additional condition and direct the learned District Judge to amend the consent decree accordingly.

The application of the Plaintiff Petitioner is allowed. In the circumstances of this

case we make no order for costs.
