Tendered on behalf of the 1st 3rd Respondents on 5th March 2021 Decided on: 10th March 2021

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

The Petitioner has filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent, Sri Lanka Telecom

PLC contained in letter dated 20th February 2020 marked P8 by which the

Petitioner was granted an extension of service for a period of only six months until

18th September 2020;

b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent contained in letter

dated 15th September 2020 marked P16 by which the Petitioner was informed

that her request for an extension of service until 18th March 2021 has been

rejected and that her retirement will take effect from 15th October 2020;

c) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision to initiate disciplinary proceedings

against the Petitioner;

3

d) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to grant the Petitioner an

extension of service until 18th March 2021.

The issue that arises for consideration in this application is whether the aforementioned

decisions of the 1st Respondent denying the Petitioner an extension of service until 18th

March 2021 is illegal, arbitrary and/or unreasonable.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner had joined the 1st Respondent as an Engineer in 1993. She had

subsequently been attached to the Administration and Human Resource Division of the

1st Respondent and had been promoted as a General Manager in 2013. In 2015, the

Petitioner had been appointed as the Chief Human Resource Officer. The Petitioner

reached the age of 55 years on 19th March 2016.

The parties are in agreement that the optional age of retirement of all employees of the

1st Respondent is 55 years of age, and that the compulsory age of retirement is 60 years.

The Petitioner has annexed marked P14 the agreement reached between the 1st

Respondent and its Unions on 10th August 2011 where the parties had agreed as

follows:

Ys% ,xld fg,sfldus fiajlhskaf.a jsY%du .ekSu jhi wjqreoq 55ka miq jdraIslj wjqreoq 60 olajd tu fiajlhskaf.a ldrahidOkh" nrm;, jsIudpdrs l%shd" meje;au yd Ydrsrsl yd udkisl fi!nH hk lreKq mokusj isoq lsrsug fomdraYjh tl. fjS' flfia jqjo" jhi

wjqreoq 60ka miqj fiajd os.+ lsrsus lsisoq fya;+jla u; isoq fkdflfra'

The Petitioner states that the retirement policy of the 1st Respondent is set out in Board

Paper No. PLC/T/192/2014 dated 17th November 2014. The said Board Paper marked

P15 has highlighted the fact that in the absence of a policy relating to the granting of

extensions of service to employees from the age of 55 years up to the age of 60 years,

the 1st Respondent has followed all applicable guidelines on the age of retirement issued

by the Department of Public Administration upto now. Accordingly, the practice adopted

4

by the 1st Respondent had been to grant annual extensions after the age of 55 years at

the discretion of the Management. By P15 approval had been sought to implement the

criteria contained therein for extensions until the age of 60 years. While in terms of

P15, extension of service of Senior Executives such as the Petitioner should be

recommended by the Chairman and CEO, and approved by the Board of Directors, any

employee who has been found guilty after a disciplinary inquiry and punished for minor

or severe misconduct was not eligible for an extension of service.

It is not in dispute that the Petitioner has been granted annual extensions from 19th

March 2016 until 18th March 2020 vide P6a P6d. Approval had been sought by a

Board Paper dated 3rd December 2019 marked P7 to extend the services of the

Petitioner and several others by a period of one year.

By letter dated 20th February 2020 marked P8, the Petitioner had been informed as

follows:

EXTENSION OF SERVICE BEYOND 59 YEARS OF AGE

With reference to your letter dated 16th September 2019 in connection with the

above, I am pleased to inform you that the Board of Directors has decided to

extend your service by a further period of six months. The extended period will

initially be for a period of three months commencing from 19th March 2020 to 18th

June 2020 until the process of recruitment of the proposed Chief Peoples Officer

(CPO) is completed and a further three months commencing from 19th June 2020

to 18th September 2020 for the smooth transition of the functions of the position of

CHRO to the new CPO.

I must note at this stage that the Petitioner did not object to the extension being

granted for a period of only six months, as opposed to the practice hitherto adopted of

granting extensions of one year. The response to P8 came only by letter dated 13th July

2020 marked P13, where the Petitioner informed the 3rd Respondent, the Chief

Executive Officer of the 1st Respondent as follows:

5

With reference to my letter dated 16th September 2019, I have requested

extension of my service for a period of 1 year with effect from 19th March 2020. But

you have extended my service for a period of six months commencing from 19th

March 2020.

I would like to request extension of my service for another six months starting from

19th September 2020.

The above request of the Petitioner was replied by letter dated 15th September 2020

marked P16 where the Petitioner was informed as follows:

This has reference to your request for a further service extension through letter

dated 13th July 2020. It is with regret that we have to inform you that the Board of

Directors have declined your request for a service extension in this instance. They

have cited the numerous irregularities that have been elicited through the

recently conducted Audit inquiry, which were communicated to you by the Group

Chief Internal Auditor on 2nd March 2020, 20th May 2020 and on 21st August 2020,

into several matters that you have handled in your capacity as the CHRO of this

company as the main reason for their decision. As such your retirement from the

services of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC will become effective on 15th October 2020.

Dissatisfied with the above decision to reject her request for an extension of service

until 18th March 2021, the Petitioner filed this application, seeking Writs of Certiorari to

quash the decision of the 1st Respondent not to extend her services, and a Writ of

Mandamus to grant the Petitioner an extension of service until 18th March 2021.

I must observe at the outset that on the same date as P16, the Petitioner was issued

with a letter marked P21 requesting her to show cause in respect of six matters set out

therein. The 1st Respondent had thereafter commenced a disciplinary inquiry against the

Petitioner, at the end of which the Petitioner has been found guilty of all charges. The

necessity to consider the legality of the decision to initiate disciplinary proceedings

against the Petitioner therefore does not arise.

6

It is clear from P15 that an extension of service will not be granted to an employee

who has been found guilty of any misconduct after a disciplinary inquiry or where a

punishment has been imposed for minor or severe misconduct The learned Presidents

Counsel for the 1st 3rd Respondents submitted that the procedure set out in P15 has

been superseded by the Employment Termination Procedure set out in 1R12

introduced on 16th April 2019. The Petitioner has however denied any knowledge of

1R12 in her counter affidavit.

I have examined 1R12 and observe that the following provisions thereof are relevant

to a consideration of the issue before me:

Service Extension Procedure

1. The age of retirement of (an) employee is 55 years. However, at the discretion

of the management the employee may be given service extensions annually

up to 60 years (compulsory age of retirement). Service extension will be

given to permanent employees of SLT PLC on their request subject to their

performance, discipline and conduct along with the management

recommendations based on the company requirements.

2.1 All employees will have to retire from service at reaching 55 years. Their

services may be extended up to 60 years of age at the sole discretion of the

management, which will be the compulsory age of retirement.

3.4 Employees who have been punished for severe misconduct will not be eligible.

3.5 In the event of a pending disciplinary investigation or inquiry against an

employee who is about to retire or on service extension, his/her service period

can be extended up to a maximum period of three months with the discretion

of the Management. However, in the event an employee is not found guilty at

the investigation or inquiry, the Management may consider his/her service

extension thereafter.

7

Having carefully considered P14, P15 and 1R12, it is clear to me that an extension of

service from the age of 55 years up to 60 years is not as of right and that the granting of

an extension is at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent. What is

critical, irrespective of whether it is P15 or 1R12 that is currently applicable, is the fact

that an employee who seeks an extension of service must have an impeccable

disciplinary record. An extension of service is a privilege afforded to an employee and

therefore I cannot subscribe to the view that extensions must be granted even where

the employer has serious concerns with regard to the discipline and conduct of an

employee.

The above position is reflected in the service extension report of a Senior Assistant

Manager marked 1R12(a) where the Petitioner, in her capacity as the Chief Human

Resource Officer had made the endorsement that you cannot extend her (services) with

pending investigations.

It is in the above background that I must consider the position of the 1st Respondent. In

its limited Statement of Objections, the 1st Respondent has submitted that the Trade

Unions of the 1st Respondent had alleged that in 2018, the Petitioner had approved the

payment of a sum of Rs. 845,000 to enable two employees of the 1st Respondent to

travel to the United Kingdom to attend a seminar, which they claimed was a clear

violation of existing policies, guidelines and procedures in connection with foreign

related trainings / visits vide 1R3.

The following findings of the Group Chief Internal Auditor (GCIA) contained in his report

marked 1R4 reveals the concerns of the 1st Respondent with regard to the above

payment:

We have observed a clear deficiency of basis in making payments for three

officials who are attending for same event as per above (whilst one person is paid

LKR 27,739.70 and other two were paid LKR 422,500 each to attend to the same

event).

8

As per the Accountant/Other Payment, the funds/budget utilised to finance the

total cost of LKR 872,739.70 belongs to welfare section (welfare budget).

We have scrutinized the particulars pertaining to foreign visits of union officials and

found that company has only incurred the cost of approved incidental allowance of

USD 35 per day for each such members in their previous visits. At this occasion,

CHRO has approved and paid total of air fare, visa fees and hotel accommodation

to Mr. Anura Perera and Mr. Rohan Nissanka instead of paying incidental

allowances.

At the current circumstance where company is facing financial difficulties, we could

not observe proper business case to sponsor the union members to attend for

global event related to union activities by spending 0.9 million.

We have not seen approvals of higher officers such as acting CEO or SLT Group

Chairman and only CHROs approval is available.

By an email dated 21st August 2020 marked P17 [also marked as 1R14], the GCIA had

requested the Petitioner to submit her response to the questionnaire that was attached

thereto. I have examined the said questionnaire and observe that in addition to the

incident referred to in 1R4, the explanation of the Petitioner had been called in respect

of the following matters:

a) Failing to take action against L.G.R.L Nissanka after he was found guilty by the

Magistrates Court of Panadura for obtaining electricity fraudulently.

b) Misuse of company funds to felicitate the Petitioner for an award that she had

received.

c) Payment of an allowance to Mr. Anura Perera for removing posters pasted in

public areas.

d) Using a SLT Vehicle although a transport allowance had been paid to the

Petitioner.

9

e) Recruitment of two persons related to the Petitioner.

f) Reinstatement of Mr. Ajantha Balasuriya who had been found guilty for

unauthorised usage of electricity.

g) Reinstatement of a SLT employee involved in theft prior to the completion of the

investigation.

The 1st Respondent had thereafter issued the Petitioner with the letter dated 15th

September 2020 marked P21 requesting the Petitioner to show cause in respect of six

charges. Simultaneous to the issuance of P21, the 1st Respondent had informed the

Petitioner by P16 that a service extension of six months cannot be granted in view of

the numerous irregularities that have been elicited though the recently conducted Audit

inquiry, which were communicated to you by the Group Chief Internal Auditor on 2nd

March 2020, 20th May 2020 and on 21st August 2020, into several matters that you have

handled in your capacity as the CHRO of this company.

It is therefore clear that the Petitioner was not granted her extension in view of the

several incidents relating to her discipline and conduct. It is in these circumstances that I

must now consider whether the decisions of the 1st Respondent contained in P8 and

P16 denying the Petitioner an extension of service until 18th March 2021 is illegal,

arbitrary, unreasonable and/or irrational.

I must reiterate that granting of a service extension is entirely at the discretion of the

Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent. The decision to reject the request of the

Petitioner for an extension has been taken by the Board of Directors and therefore, the

said decision is not illegal.

The test routinely applied to determine if a decision is unreasonable or irrational has

been set out in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v. Wednesbury

10

Corporation,1 where Lord Greene defined unreasonableness as something so absurd

that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority.

The famous example of the red-haired teacher who was dismissed due to the colour of

her hair, illustrates the high threshold for unreasonableness that was expected to

justify judicial intervention on this ground.

In Secretary of State for Education and Science v. Tameside Metropolitan Borough

Council,2 it was held that:

In public law, unreasonable as descriptive of the way in which a public authority

has purported to exercise a discretion vested in it by statute has become a term of

legal art. To fall within this expression it must be conduct which no sensible

authority acting with due appreciation of its responsibilities would have decided to

adopt.

In Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service,3 Lord Diplock

crystallised irrationality as a standalone ground for judicial review.4 The ground of

irrationality however was intrinsically linked to Wednesbury unreasonableness, and only

applied to a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral

standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be

decided could have arrived at it, thus keeping the threshold for judicial intervention still

very high.5

A common feature in the above cases is that they invite a very low level of judicial

scrutiny, where a decision is within the purported four corners of the law. As Lord

Bingham has noted, this threshold is notoriously high and a claimant has a mountain

1[1948] 1 KB 223 at pages 229-230. 2 [1977] AC 1014 at page 1064. 3 [1985] AC 374 4The test laid down by Diplock, J has been applied in Sri Lanka see Sundhakaran v. Bharathi and Others [1987] 2 Sri LR 243, at page 254. 5Although the terms, irrationality and unreasonableness are often used interchangeably, irrationality is only one facet of unreasonableness.

11

to climb.6 This reaffirms the limited role that Courts can play in exercising judicial

review, and the deference shown to the view of the public authority.

An employer expects an employee to discharge his or her duties efficiently and serve

the employer with dedication. More so than this however is the requirement that each

employee maintains the highest levels of discipline and conduct at all times. The 1st

Respondent had granted the Petitioner service extensions on four occasions. However,

the circumstances had changed when it came to the final extension with the 1st

Respondent having decided to restructure its Human Resources Division by recruiting a

Chief Peoples Officer and thereafter transferring the duties of the Petitioner to the new

Officer. Hence, the decision to limit the extension to a period of six months. This is

clearly stated in P8, to which, as I have already observed, the Petitioner did not object.

The decision in P8 has been taken in accordance with the service requirements of the

1st Respondent and in its best interests. I am therefore of the view that the decision in

P8 is reasonable.

The report of the Group Chief Internal Auditor came at the tail end of the above six

month period. The 1st Respondent had afforded the Petitioner an opportunity of giving

her side of the story to the matters set out in the said report. Having decided to issue a

show cause letter, the 1st Respondent could not have ignored the serious concerns

relating to the discipline and conduct of the Petitioner and granted the Petitioner an

extension of her services until 18th March 2021. Even though the Petitioner had not

been found guilty of any misconduct by then, the fact remained that the 1st Respondent

had serious concerns with the conduct of the Petitioner. Faced with a similar situation,

the Petitioner herself had decided in 2018, at a time when P15 was applicable vide

1R12(a) - that services of an employee cannot be extended where there are pending

investigations. In these circumstances, I am of the view that the decision to retire the

Petitioner without granting an extension of service until 18th March 2021 cannot be

considered as unreasonable or irrational. It is a decision that a sensible person who had

applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at.

6R v. Lord Chancellor Ex parte Maxwell [1997] 1 WLR 104 at 109; as referred to in De Smiths Judicial Review (Harry Woolf, Jeffery Jowell, Catherine Donnelly, Ivan Hare, De Smiths Judicial Review [8th Edition, 2018] Sweet and Maxwell) at page 599.

12

The Supreme Court arrived at a similar conclusion in Elpitiya Plantations Limited vs

Ceylon Estates Staff Union and Others7 when it held as follows:

... the optional age of retirement of the workman was 55 years, and any

extension of service was at the discretion of the management. Hence, the workman

was not entitled to any extension as a matter of right. Therefore, one cannot blame

the appellant for not extending the services of the workman after 55 years, having

regard to his unsatisfactory service record.

For all of the above reasons, I do not see any legal basis to issue formal notice of this

application on the Respondents. This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
