The Counsel for the substituted petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner)

supported this instant application to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this

Court conferred under Article 138 of the Constitution seeking to set aside the

Judgment of the High Court of Kuliyapitiya HC 176/2013 dated 10.12. 2016.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge convicted the

convicted 1st respondent by judgment dated 10.12.2016. The learned High Court

Judge imposed a term of 8 years Rigorous imprisonment and a fine with a default

term of rigorous imprisonment, on the convicted 1st respondent. Furthermore, the

he was ordered to pay compensation to the prosecution witnesses.

Page 3 of 8 CA/PHC/APN-0078-2021 17/08/2021

On the above context, petitioner being the wife of the convicted 1st respondent has

filed this application on 05.04 2021 on behalf of the convicted 1st respondent to

invoke the revisionary powers of this Court.

Prior to perusing the facts of the case, there are preliminary points that this Court

must take cognizance of. Firstly, it is well settled law that the exercise of the

revisionary powers is confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist,

warranting the intervention of court.

In Hotel Galaxy Ltd & others v Mercantile Hotel Management Ltd (1987) 1 SLR

5 Sharvananda C.J. reiterated it is settled law that the exercise of revisionary

powers of the Appellate Court is confined to cases in which exceptional

circumstances exist warranting its intervention

In Kulatilake v Attorney General (2010) 1 SLR 212, it held; "It is trite law that the

revisionary jurisdiction of this Court would be exercised if and only if exceptional

circumstances are in existence to file such an application. Moreover, it must be noted

that the Courts would exercise the revisionary jurisdiction, it being an extra ordinary

power vested in Court, especially to prevent miscarriage of justice being done to a

person and/or for the due administration of justice."

In Dharmarathne and Another v Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd. (2003) 3 SLR 24,

Gamini Amaratunga J. stated that .. the practice of court to insist on the

existence of exceptional circumstances for the exercise of revisionary powers has

taken deep root in our law and has got hardened into a rule which should not be

lightly disturbed.

In Perera v Silva, (1908) 4 ACR 79, Hutchinson C.J. commenting on the

requirement of exceptional circumstances stated that ...if such selection

process is not available, then revisionary jurisdiction of the Court will become a

gateway for every litigant to make a second appeal in the garb of a revision

application to make the appeal in situations where the legislature has not given the

right of appeal.

Page 4 of 8 CA/PHC/APN-0078-2021 17/08/2021

However, the mere existence of exceptional circumstances by itself would not allow

this court to invoke its revisionary jurisdiction. In order to maintain a revision

application, exceptional circumstances should be precisely and expressly averred

in the petition.

In Urban Development Authority v Ceylon Entertainments Ltd CA 1319/2001

Court of Appeal Minute dated 5.4.2002 Nanayakkara J. held with Udalagama J.

agreeing, that presence of exceptional circumstances by itself would not be

sufficient if there is no express pleading to the effect in the petition whenever an

application is made invoking, the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.

Similarly, in Siripala v Lanerolle (2012) 1 SLR 105, Sisira de Abrew J. held that

Even though the petitioner attempts to justify the recourse to revision in his written

submissions, it is well settled law that existence of such exceptional circumstances

should be amply and clearly demonstrated in the petition itself.in the instant

application the petitioner has neither disclosed nor expressly pleaded exceptional

circumstances that warrant intervention by way of revision.

In K.W. Ranjith Samarasinghe v K.W. Wilbert C.A (PHC) 127/99 and PHC Galle

No. 59198, the appellant made an appeal to the Court of Appeal from the High

Court of Galle against the order under Section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure

Act, Sisira de Abrew J. held It is a well-established principle that a party who has

an alternative remedy can invoke revisionary jurisdiction of a Superior Court only

upon establishment of exceptional circumstances. As I observed that the respondent

who sought the revisionary jurisdiction of Court of Appeal has an alternative remedy

in this case. Petitioner aggrieved by the judgment of the learned High Court Judge in

the exercise of his revisionary jurisdiction against the order made by the learned

Magistrate has not appealed against the said order, but he has filed the present

application in revision. I have gone through the petitioner's petition and note that the

petitioner has not established any exceptional circumstances in his petition. In order

to maintain a revision application an exceptional circumstance should be averred in

the petition.

Page 5 of 8 CA/PHC/APN-0078-2021 17/08/2021

On examination of the present application, neither in the petition nor in the

affidavit does the petitioner aver the existence of exceptional circumstances

warranting the invoking of the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court.

Having referred to the authorities above and a close scrutiny of the petition, it is

the considered view of this Court that the petitioner had failed to expressly aver

exceptional circumstances in which she had to file this revision application. It

must be highlighted in this instant that a petitioner cannot rely on the revisionary

jurisdiction of this Court as of a right. Revisionary jurisdiction is only a creature of

the discretion of this Court and as such, petitioner must expressly state the

exceptional circumstances in which such a use of discretion is warranted.

The second point of consideration is the delay in filing the present application. The

instant application was filed on 05.04 2021 and it prays inter alia to set aside an

order of the High Court of Kuliyapitiya dated 10.12. 2016. It is evident that there is

a lapse of close to 4 years since the impugned order was delivered.

Delay is a fatal error that would cause an application to be dismissed in limine, if

the petitioner fails to adduce sufficient and reasonable explanations for such

delay. This matter was discussed at length in Rajapakse v The State (2001) 2 SLR

161 which stated the following: if this Court were to act in revision the party

must come before Court without unreasonable delay. In the instant case there is a

delay of 13 months. In this regard vide Justice Ismail's judgment in Camillus

Ignatious vs. OIC of Uhana Police Station (Rev) CA 907/89 M.C. Ampara 2587

(Application in revision) where His Lordship was of the view that a mere delay of 4

months in filing revision application was fatal to maintain a revision application

before the Court of Appeal. His Lordship further added- These matters must be

considered in limine before the Court decides to hear the accused-petitioner on the

merits of his application. Before he could pass the gateway to relief his aforesaid

contumacious conduct and his unreasonable and undue delay in filing the

application must be considered and determination made upon those matters before

he is heard on the merits of the application."

In, Herath Mudiyanselage Ratnasiri Alias Nilame v The Attorney General CA

(PHC) APN 44/2016 Court of Appeal Minute dated 15.10.2019 was a case in which

the revision application was filed after 3 years and 3 months since the impugned

order that was sought to be revised. In an attempt to explain such delay, it was

alleged that an appeal has been filed. However, petitioner did not submit any

document to prove that such an appeal was filed. As such this unexplained delay

had constituted a factor that had contributed towards the rejection of the

revisionary application.

Similarly, in Seylan Bank v Thangaveil (2004) 2 SLR 101 at p. 105 held that: It

appears that there is a delay of one year and four months in respect of the order

dated 07.03.2002 and a delay of seven months from the order dated 10.01.2003.

The petitioner has not explained the delay. Unexplained and unreasonable delay in

seeking relief by way of revision, which is a discretionary remedy, is a factor which

will disentitle the petitioner to it. An application for judicial review should be made

promptly unless there are good reasons for the delay. The failure on the part of the

petitioner to explain the delay satisfactorily is by itself fatal to the application.

Having thus explained the law relating to assessment of delay, this Court now turn

to the facts of the case. The petition has not averred any explanation for the delay

of close to 4 years in filing the present revision application. The delay in coming

before this Court is inordinate which is not justified or explained by the petitioner.

The revisionary powers vested in the Court of Appeal are very wide and Court can,

in a fit case, exercise that discretionary power whether or not an appeal lies, if

exceptional circumstances are established. Nevertheless, this Court will not

exercise its discretionary powers to assist the ones who sleep over their rights -

Vigilantibus non dormientibus aequitas subvenit.

In fact, it was only upon an inquiry made by this Court on the day the application

was supported, did the Counsel for the petitioner reveal that an appeal has been

filed against the same High Court Judgment. To compound the matter further,

Counsel was unable to furnish any details of the said appeal let alone any proof of

such an appeal. Petitioner has failed to mention the same even in the petition.

Page 7 of 8 CA/PHC/APN-0078-2021 17/08/2021

It is the view of this court that the non-disclosure of a material fact such as a filing

of an appeal prior to filing a revision application, tantamount to breach in

observing uberrima fides on the part of the petitioner.

In Jayasinghe v The National Institute of Fisheries and Nautical Engineering

(NIFNE) and Others (2002) 1 SLR 277 at p. 286 the duty to disclose material

facts before Court was discussed in length: the conduct of the petitioner in

withholding these material facts from court shows a lack of uberrima fides on the

part of the petitioner. When a litigant makes an application to this court seeking

relief, he enters into a contractual obligation with the court, this contractual

relationship requires the petitioner to disclose all material facts correctly and frankly.

This Is a duty cast on any litigant seeking relief from court. In the case of Blanca

Diamonds (Pvt) Ltd. v Wilfred Van Els and two Others 1997 1 SLR 360 the

court highlighted this contractual obligation. Requiring the need to disclose

Uberrima fide and disclose all material facts fully and frankly to court. In such

instances, court will not go into merits of the case. The failure to make a full and

frank disclosure of all materials facts renders this application liable to be

dismissed.

Further, in Gas Conversions (Pvt) Ltd and 3 Others v Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation & 3 others SC FR 91/2002 at p. 4 Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake J (as

she was then) had held that a series of judgements of our court have enunciated

the requirement of complete disclosure and uberrima fides with regard to the

applications before court. It is now a well-established principle that when an

applicant has suppressed or misrepresented the facts material to an application

stand when there is no complete and truthful disclosure of all material facts the

court will not go into merits of the relevant application but will dismiss it in limine.

In Siripala v Lanerolle and Another (2012) 1 SLR 105 Per Sarath de Abrew J:

it is a cardinal principle in revisionary jurisdiction that in order to invoke the

discretionary, revisionary powers the petitioner shall make a full disclosure of

material facts known to her and there by show uberrima fides towards court.

Page 8 of 8 CA/PHC/APN-0078-2021 17/08/2021

Deliberate non-disclosure is fatal. E.g., Sirisena v Richard Arsala and Others CA

536/84 Court of Appeal Minute dated 24.10.1990

Similarly, in Dahanayake and others v Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd.

and others (2005) 1 SLR 67, it was held that "If there is no full and truthful

disclosure of material facts, the Court would not go into the merits of the application

but will dismiss it without further examination".

As such, in view of the callous disregard of the petitioner in averring exceptional

circumstances to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction, omission to render an

explanation for the inordinate delay attached to the application and non-disclosure

of material facts, this Court will not go into an examination of the merits of the

case.

Hence, this is not a fit and proper case to invoke the discretionary revisionary

powers of this Court. Taking into consideration all of the above, I see no reason to

issue notice of this application on the Respondents. This application is accordingly

dismissed, without costs.
