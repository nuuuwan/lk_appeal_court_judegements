This matter was taken up for argument together with CA (Tax) Appeal No. 1/2007

and CA (Tax) Appeal No. 4/2007. The learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the

submitted that the questions of law to be decided in this appeal are identical to the

questions of law to be decided in the aforementioned CA (Tax) Appeal No. 01/2007

and CA (Tax) Appeal No. 04/2007. The learned Counsel therefore moved that this

Court pronounce its judgment in CA (Tax) Appeal No. 1/2007 and that the parties in

this appeal are agreeable to be bound by the judgment that would be pronounced by

this Court in CA (Tax) Appeal No. 1/2007.

By a judgment delivered today in CA (Tax) Appeal No. 1/2007, this Court has

confirmed the assessment determined by the Board of Review and has dismissed the

appeal in CA (Tax) Appeal No. 1/2007, without costs. Hence, in view of the

aforementioned agreement of the parties, this Court confirms the assessment

determined by the Board of Review and this appeal is dismissed, without costs.

The Registrar is directed to send a certified copy of this judgment to the Secretary,

Tax Appeals Commission.
