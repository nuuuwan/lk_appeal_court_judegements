Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

This application was filed on 1st February 2021. Prior to this application being

supported, a group of fishermen belonging to the fishing community in Mawella filed

a petition seeking to intervene in this application. Upon the learned Presidents

Counsel for the Petitioners agreeing to the said application for intervention, the

Intervenient Petitioners were added as the 7th 227th Respondents. The Petitioners

were thereafter afforded an opportunity of responding to the matters set out in the

petition of the said Respondents.

4

This matter was taken up for support on several dates. This Court has had the benefit

of extensive oral submissions from all learned Presidents Counsel as well as written

submissions filed on behalf of all parties.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

Mawella Bay is situated on the Southern Coast of Sri Lanka between Dondra and

Tangalle and is crescent shaped. The coastal line of the Bay is approximately two

kilometers long. The Bay is characterised by a long rocky headland, approximately

500m in length. The Petitioners state that the Mawella Bay contains one of the finest

beaches in Sri Lanka for recreational and tourism purposes. The Petitioners claim

that either directly or through controlling interests that they hold in companies, they

own vast extents of land bordering the coastal line of the Mawella Bay. This claim has

been disputed by the learned Presidents Counsel who appeared for all Respondents.

The Petitioners state that in December 2020, they became aware that the 2nd

Respondent, the Ceylon Fishery Harbours Corporation is about to construct within

the Mawella Bay a fishery anchorage with a length of 300 metres and two other

offshore breakwaters, each having a length of 60 metres. The Petitioners have stated

further that the 2nd Respondent, having carried out an Initial Environmental

Examination (IEE) relating to the said construction, had submitted it to the

Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management. While a draft

copy of the said IEE has been marked P5, the Petitioners had moved that this Court

call for the original IEE that was submitted to the Department of Coast Conservation

and Coastal Resource Management. The learned Additional Solicitor General has

accordingly tendered with the written submissions of the 1st 3rd, 5th and 6th

Respondents an original of the final IEE, signed by all members.

The Petitioners state further that the 1st Respondent, the Director General of the

Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management had

thereafter issued the development permit P6 to the 3rd Respondent, the General

Manager of the Ceylon Fishery Harbours Corporation in terms of Section 14 of the

Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Act No. 57 of 1981, as

amended (the Act) to carry out the construction of the said anchorage and the two

breakwaters. Aggrieved by the decision to construct the said anchorage and the

5

breakwaters and the subsequent issuance of the said development permit, the

Petitioners filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief.

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the development permit P6;

(b) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st Respondent from extending the validity

period of the said development permit P6;

(c) A Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 2nd and 3rd Respondents from constructing

the said anchorage and breakwaters.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners presented four arguments before

this Court in support of his position that the construction of the anchorage and

breakwaters should not be proceeded with and that the issuance of the

development permit is contrary to the provisions of the law.

The first argument is that there is no necessity for an anchorage and breakwater in

the Mawella Bay. The essence of this argument is that the Kudawella and Tangalle

fishery harbours are situated in close proximity to the Mawella Bay and that there is

no need to create another formal landing site for boats in Mawella. It is clear that the

Petitioners are concerned that the creation of another fishery harbour at Mawella

Bay would pollute the pristine beaches at Mawella and thereby reduce the attraction

of Mawella to tourists.

In considering this submission, I shall commence with the draft IEE report marked

P5, the contents of which are identical to the original of the IEE tendered to this

Court by the learned Additional Solicitor General. According to P5:

a) The fishing industry in Mawella area has a long history and is well established;

b) The Mawella Bay acts as a boat landing site for about 1000 families living in four

Grama Niladhari divisions that depend on fishing activities for their livelihood;

c) There are seven fisheries associations formed by the fishermen of the area;

6

d) The livelihoods of the fishing families have been affected by the modernisation

of the fishing industry, thereby pushing them to depend on Government

welfare schemes;

e) The fishermen who operate small boats have no access to other landing sites or

fishery harbours located in Kudawella or Tangalle;

f) It is difficult to land the boats at the beach during the high sea period, and

therefore safe landing facilities are required if the fishermen are to engage in

fishing over a longer period of the year and thereby improve their productivity;

g) In order to ensure sustainability of the fishing industry and to eradicate the

prevailing development disparities in the fishing industry, it is necessary to

improve the existing facilities at Mawella Bay by providing infrastructure by way

of the proposed anchorage.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 7th -227th Respondents submitted that the

decision to develop the Mawella Bay as a fisheries landing site was a Policy decision

that was taken by the Cabinet of Ministers several years ago, as part of an overall

plan to develop fisheries harbours and facilities right around the Country. He drew

the attention of this Court to three documents which demonstrate the rationale for

the construction of the anchorage.

The first document is the Cabinet Memorandum dated 5th September 2018, marked

IP19 submitted by the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development

and Rural Economy, which refers to the decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers in

September 2013 to develop and rehabilitate fishery harbours, anchorages, and

landing sites throughout the Country, including at Mawella.1 The said Memorandum

goes onto state that having taken into consideration the requests of the fisheries

community for enhanced infrastructure facilities, the Government has taken a policy

decision to construct an anchorage at Mawella. The said Memorandum emphasizes

1 See Coastal Area Management in Sri Lanka by Kem Lowry and H.J.M. Wickremaratne (annexed to the written submissions of the Petitioners) which states as follows: The Sri Lanka Government has made coastal fisheries one of their primary development priorities. The Government has provided subsidies for boats and engines and developed marketing, harbour and anchorage facilities.

7

the fact that the interests of the fishing community and the environmental concerns

have been taken into consideration.

The second document is a letter dated 24th August 2018 marked IP18 sent by the

Director General, Department of National Planning, where it is stated as follows:

it is apparent that the harnessing of marine resources on a sustainable manner

requires modern and well equipped fishery infrastructure, specially fishery

harbours, improved anchorage facilities and landing sites. Since nearly 2.6

million people of the country directly or indirectly engage in the fishery sector

for their livelihood, strengthening fisheries infrastructure will directly benefit the

countrys socio-economic development on one hand and food security on the

other.

The third document is a letter dated 31st October 2019 marked IP27 by which the

Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources have highlighted the difficulties

faced by fishermen as a result of not having an anchorage facility at Mawella.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 7th - 227th Respondents submitted that an

anchorage would provide a safe landing area and a safe unloading area, as the

waters within the basin created by the anchorage would be calm and the boats

would not be tossed around.

The Petitioners too admit that even as at now, there are approximately seventy five

boats berthed at the Mawella Beach. It was the submission of the Respondents that

presently the entire beach area is scattered with small boats, and that the anchorage

would in fact serve as a dedicated landing area for the small boats, thus negating to a

great extent the necessity of using the rest of the beach area for the landing of boats.

It was the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for the 7th -227th

Respondents that the anchorage would also provide berthing facilities to boats which

are engaged in whale watching and other recreational activities related to tourism,

and that the fishing and tourism industry can mutually co-exist.

8

While it is not for this Court to decide if a necessity exists for an anchorage at

Mawella Bay, a consideration of the above material makes it clear that the necessity

for an anchorage at Mawella Bay has been carefully considered by the Department

of National Planning and the Cabinet of Ministers, and that there in fact exists a

necessity to provide such facilities to uplift the standard of living of the fisheries

community living in Mawella.

I shall now consider the submission of the Respondents with regard to the necessity

for the two offshore breakwaters. While the anchorage was to meet the needs of the

fishing community, the construction of the two offshore breakwaters was to reduce

the erosion of the beach in the Mawella Bay during the monsoon period, thereby

safeguarding the interests of the tourism industry by having a beach right throughout

the year.

It has been submitted by the Petitioners that the Coastal Zone and Coastal Resource

Management Plan marked P9 prepared in terms of Section 12 of the Act has

identified that construction of unplanned or poorly planned rigid coastal structures

are causing erosion. While P9 does say so, construction of offshore structures as a

method of preventing sea erosion has been adopted in many countries including Sri

Lanka, with success.2

The learned Additional Solicitor General drew the attention of this Court to

paragraphs A6, C.1.3, C.2.4.1 and D.9.2.1, from the draft IEE Report P5 which

confirm the following:

a) There exists beach erosion during the South West monsoon;

b) It has been a long standing issue in the area;

c) The proposed offshore breakwaters are expected to mitigate the coastal

erosion during the South West monsoon;

d) The breakwaters may lead to the establishment of wider coastal area and sand

deposits.

2 This position is confirmed by the article titled, Coastal Area Management in Sri Lanka submitted with the written submissions filed by the Petitioners; supra.

9

Having examined the contents of the IEE, it appears that the Respondents have

carried out the necessary studies to establish not only a necessity for the said

breakwaters, but also that it is the only option available and would not cause any

erosion elsewhere. I am therefore of the view that it is beyond the scope of the

jurisdiction of this Court to declare that there exists no necessity for the said

breakwaters.

The second submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners was

that the 1st Respondent should have called for an Environmental Impact Assessment

(EIA) Report prior to issuing a development permit, and that his decision not to do so

is illegal and unreasonable.

Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service3

identified 'illegality', 'irrationality' and 'procedural impropriety' as the three grounds

upon which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. In

considering the second submission on behalf of the Petitioners, I shall bear in mind

the following description of illegality and irrationality:

By 'illegality' as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision maker must

understand correctly the law that regulates his decision making power and must

give effect to it..

By irrationality I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as Wednesbury

unreasonableness4. It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance

of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied

his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.

Once the necessity for the said anchorage and breakwaters was established, the

Ministry of Fisheries has contracted the services of M/s Lanka Hydraulic Institute

Limited to carry out a feasibility study in order to determine the location of the said

anchorage and the breakwater. A copy of the said feasibility study report has been

marked IP1a. The Petitioners have not sought to quash the said report. In the

3 1985 AC 374 4 Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation 1948(1)KB 223

10

absence of any challenge to the contents of the said report, the necessity for this

Court to examine the validity of that report does not arise.

In considering the second submission, it would be useful to understand what is

sought to be constructed by the 2nd Respondent. As already observed, there is going

to be three structures. The first is an anchorage breakwater of 260m length,

connected to land and extending from the shore to a depth of -5m MSL. As set out in

P5, it has sea side slope of 1:2 and lee side slope of 2:3. The breakwater head

section has a slope of 1:2. The crest width at the beginning is 2.75m while at the end

of head section, it is 5.5m. The design has been prepared taking into consideration

stability, wave run up and overtopping. The stability of the anchorage has been

assessed in terms of the Hudsons Formula and the Van Der Meers Formula, and the

sizes of the armour has been computed accordingly. The other two structures are

offshore breakwaters, with a length of 60 feet each and located at a depth of 3m and

at close distance from the coastal line.

All three structures will be constructed utilising granite and will consist of three

layers, namely the primary, secondary and the core layers, stacked one on top of the

other, with the granite being of different sizes and weight.5 The structural design of

all three structures, prepared by Lanka Hydraulic Institute Limited is available in P5.6

In simple terms, the above constructions involve laying on the sea bed three layers of

granite with the necessary structural support that would provide the protection that

is expected.

Part III of the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Act No. 57 of

1981, as amended (the Act) contains provisions relating to the necessity to obtain a

permit and the issuance thereof to carry out any development activity within the

coastal zone.

Section 14(1) provides that no person shall engage in any development activity

other than a prescribed development activity within the Coastal Zone except under

the authority of a permit issued in that behalf by the Director.

5 Vide paragraph B1 of P5. 6 Vide page 16 and Annex IV of P5 Drawing Nos. 1711 M02 and M03.

11

Section 14(3) mandates an application to be submitted to obtain such permit. The

parties are in agreement that the 3rd Respondent was required to apply and obtain

from the 1st Respondent a permit prior to engaging in the construction of the said

anchorage and breakwaters.

The procedure that should be followed by the 1st Respondent in respect of an

application is set out in Section 16 (1) of the Act, which reads as follows:

Upon receipt of an application for a permit to engage in a development activity

within the Coastal Zone as required by subsection (3) of section 14, the Director-

General may require the applicant to furnish

an initial environmental examination report, or

an environmental impact assessment report

relating to the development activity as the case may be, or both such reports. It

shall be the duty of the applicant to comply with such requirement. Every initial

environmental examination report or environmental impact assessment report

shall contain such particulars as may be prescribed.

It would perhaps be relevant to re-produce at this stage, the definitions given in the

Act for an EIA and an IEE:

initial environmental examination report means a written report wherein

possible impacts of the development activity on the environment shall be

assessed with a view to determining whether the impacts are significant and

therefore requires the preparation of an environmental impact assessment

report. Such report shall contain all details and descriptions, data maps, designs

and other information which is relevant to the development activity

environmental impact assessment means a written analysis of the predicted

environmental consequences of a proposed development activity, and includes a

description of the avoidable and unavoidable adverse environmental effects of

the proposed development activity, a description of alternatives to the activity

which might be less harmful to the environment of the Coastal Zone, together

12

with the reasons why such alternatives were rejected, and a description of any

irreversible or irretrievable commitments of resources required by the proposed

development activity

Whether an IEE should be called or whether an EIA should be called straight away

would therefore depend on the nature of the construction that is contemplated.

Having received the application of the 3rd Respondent and bearing in mind what was

proposed to be constructed, the 1st Respondent, by his letter dated 8th March 2019

had informed the 3rd Respondent as follows:7

Considering the possible environmental and socio-economic impacts due to the

proposed project, it was decided to carry out the Initial Environmental

Examination (IEE) procedure to consider granting approval for the above

project.

You are kindly requested to submit the Initial Environmental Examination Report

for the proposed fishery anchorage facility at Mawella in Hambanthota District.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the IEE Report is sent herewith.

The IEE Report must address all matters referred to in the TOR...

The Terms of Reference (TOR) referred to above sets out in detail the matters that

must be addressed by the 2nd Respondent in the IEE, including the adverse

environmental impact together with the measures that must be adopted to mitigate

such adverse impacts.8 The Petitioners have not complained that the TOR given by

the 1st Respondent is inadequate or that it fails to address the proper concerns

relating to a project of this nature. In my view, the decision of the 1st Respondent to

call for an IEE is within the powers conferred on the 1st Respondent by Section 16(1)

of the Act. By doing so, the 1st Respondent has not acted illegally or ultra vires his

powers, nor can such a decision be described as being irrational or unreasonable.

Section 16(2) of the Act provides as follows:

7 This letter is available at Annex I of P5. 8 The TOR is available at Annex I of P5.

13

In cases where an initial environmental examination report is requested by the

Director General, he may, on receipt of such report and if it appears that such

report is sufficient for the purpose of determining, whether or not to grant the

permit, dispense with the requirement of providing the environmental impact

assessment report.

Thus, it is mandatory that either an IEE or an EIA must be carried out. Once an IEE is

carried out, the decision whether an EIA should also be carried out depends on the

contents of the IEE Report. In this regard, it is important to note that it is the 1st

Respondent who prepared the TOR to be followed by the Project Proponent, and

that it is the 1st Respondent who is in the best position to decide if an IEE is sufficient.

While the Petitioners have not produced any material to show that the 1st

Respondent should have called for an EIA or that there would be adverse

environmental effects arising from the proposed development activity, this Court

does not have the expertise to decide whether the IEE Report is not sufficient and

that an EIA Report should have been called for. This Court would therefore have to

be guided by the decision of the 1st Respondent, in the absence of any material that a

Project of this nature requires an EIA to be carried out.

This position has been clearly laid down in Environmental Foundation Limited Vs.

Central Environmental Authority,9 where Sripavan J held as follows:

This court would not substitute its discretion for that of the expert, but would

interfere with its exercise, if it is sought to be exercised in an arbitrary manner

or in matters outside the limits of the discretionary authority conferred by the

legislature or on considerations extraneous to those laid down by the

legislature. Thus, this court cannot issue a writ of mandamus directing the first

respondent to call for an EIAR in respect of the said project. The discretion to call

for an EIAR or IEER has to be exercised by the first respondent and by the first

respondent only. Any clear departure from the objects of the statute is

objectionable and renders the act invalid in law

9 [2006] 3 Sri LR 57.

14

Useful guidance on how the discretion should be exercised is found in the Sri Lanka

Coastal Zone and Coastal Resource Management Plan 2018 prepared in terms of

Section 12(1) of the Act and approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on 25th April 2018,

published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 272/58 dated 25th May 2018. Paragraph 6.6

of the said Plan marked P9, having referred to Section 16 of the Act, goes onto state

as follows:

In compliance with the above legal provision, when an application is received

for a permit to engage in a development activity within the Coastal Zone, the

Director General Coast Conservation and Coastal Resources Management will

determine whether such activity requires an EIA or IEE. Although the Director

General has discretionary powers, in determining the requirements of an EIA or

IEE, the CC&CRMD will consult the CEA where necessary and due consideration

will be given to the list of prescribed projects under the NEA. It shall be the duty

of the applicant to comply with the relevant requirements.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 7th 227th Respondents submitted that even

though in terms of the Regulations published by the Central Environmental Authority

(CEA), a harbour or a port is a prescribed project that requires an EIA to be carried

out, the said Regulations do not impose such a requirement in respect of

breakwaters and anchorages. He has submitted further that the construction of a

harbour or a port is of a much higher magnitude in terms of structures and the

utilization of the coast, than an anchorage or a breakwater, and that these are

factors that would have been considered by the 1st Respondent in arriving at his

decision that an IEE would suffice. This position was supported by the learned

Additional Solicitor General who submitted that an EIA is necessary for a project such

as the Colombo Port City which involved the reclamation of the sea. He submitted

that it is a judgmental call that the 1st Respondent is required to make depending on

the nature of the works vis--vis their intervention with the coastal environment.

The Petitioners have submitted an undated and unsigned four-page report marked

P7. In paragraph 2.1 thereof, referring to the anchorage site, it is acknowledged

that, This involves the construction o a curved sheltered low energy region and would

have minimal impact on the adjacent beaches.

15

Taking into consideration all of the above circumstances, I am of the view that the

decision of the 1st Respondent to limit the review of the construction of the

anchorage and the breakwaters to an IEE is within his powers and is neither illegal

nor unreasonable.

The third argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners was that

there are serious flaws with the IEE, in that those who carried out the IEE have

copied certain materials from the Feasibility Study conducted by Lanka Hydraulics

Institute Limited. It was the position of the Petitioners that the location of the

anchorage and the breakwaters in terms of the Feasibility Study conducted by Lanka

Hydraulics Institute Limited is different to the location of the said structures given in

the IEE, and for that reason, the failure on the part of those who conducted the IEE

to study the behavior of the wave patterns and sand migration amounts to a serious

flaw in the IEE. The learned Additional Solicitor General has however submitted that

the offshore breakwaters were analysed and studied in P5 and that soil erosion due

to the construction of the offshore breakwaters have been considered in P5. While

it is correct that those who did the IEE have taken material from the Feasibility

Study,10 which in fact has been acknowledged, the fact remains that the overall

quality of the IEE is not affected by this. In these circumstances, I am of the view that

this is not a ground on which the IEE can be struck down.

The fourth argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners revolves

around the development permit P6. It was pointed out that P6 had been issued

on 17th December 2019 and was valid for a period of one year. The argument of the

Petitioners was that even though the permit expired on 17th December 2020, work

on the anchorage continued in the absence of a valid permit. It is correct that the

permit expired on 17th December 2020. However, on 17th February 2021 the 1st

Respondent has extended the validity period of the license for a further year with

effect from 17th December 2020 including the period when the construction took

place. There is now in existence a permit valid until 17th December 2021 vide IP26.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner thereafter referred to Clause 2.6

of P6 which reads as follows - The Environmental Protection License should be

10 Vide Annex II of P5.

16

obtained from the Central Environmental Authority prior to the commencement of

the proposed project.

It was the submission of the Petitioners that the 3rd Respondent has failed to obtain

an EPL and therefore, continuing with the construction is illegal. The permit P6 has

been issued for the construction of the anchorage and the breakwaters. Once they

are erected, the 3rd Respondent must operate the said anchorage. It is for the

operation of the anchorage that the EPL is required from the Central Environmental

Authority, to ensure that all environmental requirements during the operation are

complied with. To say that an EPL is required for the construction of the anchorage

and the breakwaters is not correct. The regulatory authority for all constructions

within the coastal zone is the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal

Resource Management. As I have already referred to, in terms of the Act, it is the 1st

Respondent, in his capacity as the Director General of the said Department who has

been conferred with the power to approve an IEE or EIA. The CEA is not involved with

granting approval to carry out development activity within the coastal zone unless

the 1st Respondent consults the CEA. Hence, the question of obtaining an EPL from

the CEA to carry out any development activity does not arise.

This brings me to the final argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioners. He submitted that the Petitioners apprehend that the anchorage is being

constructed for use by operators of multi day boats, which is contrary to the

recommendation in the IEE. Soon after this matter was taken up for support, the

learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners, without prejudice to the above

arguments, submitted that the Petitioners have no objection to the construction of

the anchorage if multi day boat operators are not permitted to use the anchorage.

Although the Respondents were agreeable to the said resolution, the parties could

not agree on the exact scope of a settlement.

I have already adverted to the fact that the construction of the anchorage and the

two breakwaters is being carried out to achieve two primary goals. The first is to

provide inter alia a safe landing site for small boats. The second is to prevent further

sea erosion. Whether multi day boats could also be permitted to use the anchorage

has been considered in the IEE. In my view, the following conclusion and

recommendations in P5 are critical:

17

The proposed development Project in Mawella fishery anchorage facility is a

felt need of most of the marginal fishing community. Even though it may not

provide required services to the Multi day boat owners they are not significant

in number. The number of one day boat operators and other small boat

operators are much more significant in number and therefore their voice should

be given due recognition. The present loss to the one day boat operators and

other marginal fishermen is much significant due to frequent damages to their

boats during high sea period and also the income they have to forego due to

high sea period are significant.

Mawella Bay is recommended as a fishery anchorage facility with limited

capacity (anchorage) to service only for the coastal operating crafts since they

cannot make safe beach landing during the monsoon. It should not be

considered for constructing harbour facilities for multiday operating bigger

boats since Mawella Bay is of higher scenic beauty in which beach seine fishing

historically operating and also recreational activities such as swimming, surfing

and snorkeling for both foreign tourists and the citizens of the country. Further,

harbour facilities for multiday boats are available at Kudawella, Nilwella and

Tangalle which are located quite close to Mawella.

While this Court is unaware if any further matters need to be considered if multi day

boat operators are to be permitted to use the anchorage facility, one must bear in

mind that the decision of the 1st Respondent to accept the IEE and not to proceed

with an EIA, as well as issue the Development Permit P6 would have been

influenced by the above conclusion and recommendation. In these circumstances, I

am of the view that the development activity contemplated by the IEE and for which

approval has been granted by P6 does not extend to permitting multi day boat

operators to enter and/or anchor at the proposed anchorage.

It is significant that the above position is supported by all Respondents. The learned

Additional Solicitor General submitted that several meetings were held with the

stakeholders including multi day boat operators during the preparation of the

18

Feasibility Study Report and the IEE Report, and that the above recommendations

were made only thereafter.11

In the written submissions filed on behalf of the 7th 227th Respondents, it has been

submitted as follows:

As far as intervenient respondents are concerned, they are the owners of

traditional boats, oru, wallam sailing and small boats. This anchorage is for

them. They are also of the view that multi day boats should not come into the

anchorage, for if that happens, the space and facility available for the small

boats will be compromised.12

In the above circumstances, I see no legal basis to issue formal notice of this

application on the Respondents. This application is accordingly dismissed, without

costs, subject to the above finding that the development activity contemplated by

the IEE and for which approval has been granted by P6 does not extend to

permitting multi day boat operators to enter and/or anchor at the proposed

anchorage.
