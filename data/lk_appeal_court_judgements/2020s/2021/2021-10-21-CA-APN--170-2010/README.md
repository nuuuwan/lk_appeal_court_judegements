This Appeal emanates from the judgement dated 16.06.2010 of the learned High Court

Judge of the Provincial High Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy in the

Appeal bearing No. Appeal 67/2009. The facts pertaining to the Appeal were as briefly

as follows;

The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Applicant)

initiated proceedings in the Magistrates Court of Nawalapitiya by a Certificate

(hereinafter referred to as the Certificate) filed under section 59 (1) (c) of the Co-

operative Societies Law, No. 5 of 1972 (as amended) (hereinafter referred to as the Co-

operative Law) against the 1st Accused-Appellant-Appellant and the 2nd Accused-

Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 1st and 2nd Accused respectively)

seeking to enforce an Arbitral Award made under section 58 (2) of the Co-operative

Law. After the summons were served on the 1st and 2nd Accused, they appeared before

the Magistrates Court and in terms of section 59 (4) (c) of the Co-operative Law, the

learned Magistrate has granted them an opportunity to show cause against the

Certificate. Being dissatisfied with the cause shown by the 1st Accused, the learned

Magistrate, in terms of section 59 (4) of the Co-operative Law has ordered to recover

the sum mentioned in the Certificate from the 1st and the 2nd Accused as a fine. Against

that Order dated 29.05.2009, the 1st Accused preferred an Appeal to the Provincial High

Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy. On 16.06.2010, the learned High Court

Judge has dismissed the Appeal on the basis that the Co-operative Law does not provide

Appeal rights. By this Appeal, the 1st Accused seeks to set aside the Order of the learned

High Court Judge dismissing the appeal.

4

When the matter was taken up for Argument, the parties consented to abide by a

judgment delivered on their Written Submissions, dispensing with their rights to make

Oral Submissions. The contention of the learned Counsel for the 1st Accused is that in

terms of section 4 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

(ICCPR) Act, No. 56 of 2007 (hereinafter referred to as the ICCPR Act) the 1st Accused

has the right of Appeal against the Order of the learned Magistrate. To strengthen his

position, the learned Counsel has cited the Supreme Court decision in Mallarachchige

Kanishka Gunawardhana Vs. H.K. Sumanasena and the Hon. Attorney General (S.C.

Appeal No. 201/2014 decided on 15.03.2018). The contention of the learned State

Counsel for the Applicant is that the Co-operative Societies Law, does not provide

appeal rights and since the legal position considered in the case cited by the learned

Counsel for the 1st Accused has no relevance to the case in hand, that decision does not

make a binding effect for the facts of the instant action.

There is no specific provision in the Co-operative Societies Law, which the appeal

rights are conferred on the parties and it is a trite law that the right of appeal is a statutory

right and unless the statute provides that right parties are not entitled to the reliefs by

way of appeal.

The proceedings in the Magistrates Court pertaining to the instant action has been

initiated under section 59 (4) of the Co-operative Law, on a Certificate issued by the

Applicant to the Magistrate in terms of Paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 59.

Subsection (4) of section 59 states thus;

Where a certificate is issued to a Magistrate under paragraph (c) of subsection (1),

the Magistrate shall thereupon summon such defaulter before him to show cause why

further proceedings for the recovery of the amount should not be taken against him,

and in default of sufficient cause being shown, the amount shall be deemed to be a fine

imposed by a sentence of the Magistrate on such defaulter for an offence punishable

with fine only or not punishable with imprisonment ...

5

Therefore, when considering the above stated provisions of section 59 (4) it is clear that

it stipulates the procedure which the Magistrate should follow when a certificate is

issued seeking to enforce the Arbitral Award and recover the sum mentioned in the

certificate from the defaulter. The defaulter is not burdened with a criminal liability

under that subsection and therefore, the Magistrate does not invoke criminal jurisdiction

vested in him in recovering the sum mentioned in the certificate.

The Supreme Court has considered in the case cited by the learned Counsel for the 1st

Accused a situation where the appellant was convicted and sentenced for a charge

punishable under section 64 (a) of the Foreign Employment Bureau Act, No. 21 of

1985. That Act does not provide appeal rights to the parties. Nevertheless, His Lordship,

Justice Aluwihare has concluded in that authority that even though, the appeal rights

are not conferred on the parties by the Foreign Employment Bureau Act, No. 21 of

1985, in terms of section 4 (2) of the ICCPR Act the appellant is entitled to lodge an

appeal against the conviction and the sentence.

Section 64 (a) of the Foreign Employment Bureau Act, No. 21 of 1985 provides that;

Any person who,

a) being a licensee charges any fee otherwise than as provided in section 51 for

the purposes of providing or securing employment outside Sri Lanka for any

other person;

b) not being a licensee, demands or receives or attempts to receive for himself or

any other person, any money for the purpose of providing or securing

employment for any person outside Sri Lanka,

shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall be liable on conviction

after summary trial by a Magistrate to a fine not less than one thousand rupees

and not exceeding one thousand five hundred rupees and to imprisonment of

either description for a term not less than twelve months and not exceeding two

years. The Magistrate shall, in addition, order the offender to refund the fee or

6

money which is the subject of the offence, to the person from whom the offender

received such fee or money.

When considering the above statutory provisions, it is clear that under section 64 (a) of

the Foreign Employment Bureau Act, a Magistrate is vested with powers to convict a

person and sentence only after having a summary trial against the alleged perpetrator.

Section 4 (2) of the ICCPR Act, provides thus;

Every person convicted of a criminal offence under written law, shall have the right

to appeal to a higher court against such conviction and any sentence imposed.

Therefore, it is clear that as provided by sub-section 2 of section 4 of the ICCPR Act,

the appealable right of a person who is convicted and sentenced after a summary trial

is guaranteed if, he is convicted and sentenced for a criminal offence under any written

law. Nevertheless, in the action in hand the 1st and 2nd Accused were neither charged

before the Magistrates Court for a criminal offence under any written law nor had been

tried nor convicted or sentenced. The action had been filed against them in the

Magistrates Court to recover the Arbitral Award. After giving them an opportunity to

show cause as to why further proceedings for recovery the Arbitral Award should not

be taken and in default of sufficient cause being shown the learned Magistrate

performing an administrative duty has decided to recover the amount mentioned in the

Certificate as a fine imposed on the 1st and 2nd Accused. Therefore, the duty performed

by the learned Magistrate in the action filed under the Co-operative Law and the

function of a Magistrate in a summary trial against a person who has allegedly

committed a criminal offence could be clearly distinguished as above mentioned. Under

those circumstances, I hold that the provisions of section 4 (2) of the ICCPR Act do not

apply to the case in hand and since the appealable rights are not conferred under the

Co-operative Law, the 1st Accused has no right to appeal against the Order of the

learned Magistrate.

7

Therefore, I hold that the impugned judgment of the learned High Court Judge

affirming the Order of the learned Magistrate is according to law. I affirm the impugned

judgment of the learned High Court Judge and dismiss the appeal. 1st Accused should

pay Rs. 30,000/- to the Applicant as costs of this appeal.

It is important to draw the attention to the following provisions of the ICCPR Act and

the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the Covenant). Sub-section 2

of section 4 of the ICCPR Act is based on the Article 41 of the Covenant. Article 41.5

of the Covenant states thus;

Everyone convicted of a crime shall have the right to his conviction and sentence being

reviewed by a higher tribunal according to law (emphasis added).

Therefore, it appears that the appealable right of a person is guaranteed by the

Convention subject to the law of the land in the particular country. If the statute under

which a person is convicted and sentenced does not provide appealable rights, he has

no right to appeal against his conviction and the sentence. Nevertheless, when drafting

the ICCPR Act, the words according to law has been omitted and as a result, even

though, the appealable rights have not been given by the statute an appeal could be

preferred under sub-section 2 of section 4 of the ICCPR Act against a conviction and a

sentence.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

I agree.
