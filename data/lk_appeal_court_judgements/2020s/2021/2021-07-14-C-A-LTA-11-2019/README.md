Before: M. T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. and

K.K.A.V. SWANADHIPATHI, J.

Counsel: Chandaka Jayasundera, PC with Mehran Careem and Imaz

Imthiyas instructed by Nalin Samarakkoon for the Petitioners. N.M. Saheed with M.M.F. Shafeena and N.R. Husni for the

Respondents. Written Submissions on: 08.09.2020 (by the Defendant-Petitioners). 06.02.2020 (by the Plaintiff-Respondents). Argued on: 08.03.2021.

Decided on: 14.07.2021.

MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Defendant-Petitioners (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioners) are

seeking Leave to Appeal from the order of the Wakfs Tribunal dated

14.12.2019. The leave was granted on 13.02.2020.

The Plaintiff-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Respondents), in

terms of the provisions of the Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or

Wakfs Act No. 51 of 1956 (as amended), instituted action before the Tribunal

against the Petitioners, seeking relief as prayed for in the prayers to the plaint

dated 31.10.2019.

Page 6 of 9

When the matter was taken up for hearing before the Tribunal, the learned

Counsel for the Petitioners raised several preliminary objections as to the

maintainability of this action. Of which, the significant preliminary objection,

which is relevant to this order, reads as follows:

The certificate marked P4, issued in terms of section 9E (3) of the

Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs Act No. 51 of 1956 (as

amended), is bad in law, and therefore, the action is liable to be

dismissed in-limine.

The contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners was that

the certificate marked P4 was issued by the Director of the Department of

Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs (hereinafter referred to as the Director

of the DMRCA), and whereas the said certificate should have been issued by

the Director of the Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs

(hereinafter referred to as the Director of the MMCTW), as envisaged by the

Act.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the Respondents was that the

Director of the DMRCA, who has issued the certificate in dispute marked P4,

is having a dual role, both as the Director of the DMRCA and the Director of

the MMCTW. As such, the certificate marked P4 is a valid document in terms

of section 9E (3) of the Act.

The certificate marked P4 has been signed by the Director of the DMRCA.

However, the contents of the said certificate substantiates the fact that the

same was issued under section 9E (3) of the said Act, which reads thus:

As per approval of the Wakfs Board of Sri Lanka on 08th October 2019,

permission is hereby granted to institute legal action in Wakfs Tribunal

under provisions of section 9E (3) of the Wakfs Act No. 51 of 1956 as

amended by Act No. 21 of 1962 and 33 of 1982 against the Trustees of

Page 7 of 9

the N.D.H. Gafoor Trust regarding Wakfs property situated in Colombo-

14.1

Having scrutinized the certificate marked P4, it is abundantly clear that Mr.

M.R.M. Malik was mindful of the fact that he has issued the same as the

Director of the MMCTW as well in addition to the Director of the DMRCA.

The attention of this Court is drawn to the observation made by the Wakfs

tribunal in this regard, which reads thus:

It is an undisputable fact that the Director of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs,

over a period of time, has been performing the functions pertaining to those of the

Director designated under the Wakfs Act. The issuance of the certificates (like P4) has

been accepted in several cases as the function of the Director for Mosques and Muslim

Charitable Trusts of Wakfs. Since one person is functioning in a dual position, the mere

wrong designation appearing under the signature of the Director in P4 cannot be taken

as fatal for the dismissal of the action,2

It is to be noted that the Wakfs Tribunal is an original Court as far as the case

in hand is concerned. The Tribunal is having a benefit of scrutinizing number

of certificates issued in terms of section 9E (3) of the Act in several cases. In

the circumstances, the foregoing observations of the Tribunal in respect of

issuing of certificate by the Director cannot be disregarded.

In Alwis vs. Piyasena3, it was held that it is well established that findings of

primary facts by a trial Judge who hears and sees witnesses are not to be

lightly disturbed on appeal.

In the impugned order dated 14.12.2019, the Wakfs Tribunal further observed

the fact that the Minister of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs, by his

letter dated 11.06.2018 has appointed Mr. M.R.M. Malik as Director for

1 Vide para 2 of the P4. 2 Vide p. 5 of the Wakf Tribunals judgment (P6). 3 [1993] 1 Sri LR 119.

Page 8 of 9

Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trust/Wakfs as well. This observation has

not been challenged by the Petitioners in their petition4.

In these respects, having considered the totality of the documentary evidence

and the observations made by the Tribunal it is manifestly clear that the

Director of the DMRCA is lawfully functioning as the Director of the MMCTW

as well.

I do agree with the observation made by the Wakfs Tribunal stating that this

is a technical objection raised by the learned Counsel for the Petitioners.

In the case of Elias vs. Cader5 , the Supreme Court observed that,

For the proper dispensation of justice, raising of technical objections

should be discouraged and the parties should be encouraged to seek

justice by dealing with the merits of cases. The raising of such technical

objections and dealing with them and the subsequent challenges on them

to the superior courts takes up so much time and adds up to the delay

and the backlog of cases pending in Courts. Very often the dealing of

such technicalities become only an academic exercise with which the

litigants would not be interested. The delay in dispensation of justice can

be minimized if the parties are discouraged from taking up technical

objections which takes up valuable judicial time. What is important for

litigants would be their aspiration to get justice from courts on merits

rather than on technicalities. As has often been quoted it must be

remembered that courts of law are Courts of justice and not academies

of law.6

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners cited the case of Sheriff

vs. Jamaldeen7 where it was held that, it is mandatory to obtain a certificate

from the Director to invoke the jurisdiction of the District Court/Wakfs

Tribunal.

It is pertinent to be noted that the Sheriffs case (supra) is factually different

from the instant case. In the case in hand, the said certificate has been filed

by the Respondents along with the plaint. But, in Sheriffs case the approval

was not obtained from the Board and the certificate was not issued by the

Director. In the circumstances, it is the view of this Court that the decision in

Sheriffs case has no application to the instant case.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the

Wakfs Tribunal dated 14.12.2019. Thus, the appeal is dismissed with costs,

fixed at Rs. 25,000/- and the impugned order is affirmed.

The Registrar is directed to dispatch a copy of this order to the Wakfs

Tribunal.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
