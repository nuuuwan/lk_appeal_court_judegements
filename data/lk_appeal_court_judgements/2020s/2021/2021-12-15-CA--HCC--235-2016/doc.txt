The accused-appellant (the appellant) was indicted in the High Court of Matara

for having caused grievous injuries to a person named Hemasiri, an offence

punishable under section 316 of the Penal Code.

After trial, the Learned Trial Judge found the appellant guilty to a lesser

offence, namely simple hurt, punishable under section 314 of the Penal Code.

The Learned Trial Judge imposed a fine of Rs. 1,000/= on the appellant with a

default term of one-month simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the appellant preferred

this appeal.

The alleged incident happened on the 19th of December 2009, at Hakmana

around 10.00 p.m. The appellant was attached to the Hakmana police station

as an officer-in-charge.

PW1 gave evidence that he, PW2 and PW3 were working for a candidate in the

Presidential Election, and they were entrusted with publicity work. They were

waiting in Hakmana town after pasting the posters for the meeting which was

to be held in Matara on the 20th of December 2009. As per the evidence of PW1,

a police jeep came and stopped near them. The appellant was driving the jeep

and without getting down, he told the three of them using abusive language,

"don't you know that pasting posters after the 16th was prohibited". PW3 was

carrying the bundle of posters and the appellant had asked the police constable

to put PW3 into the jeep. At this juncture, PW1 resisted the policeman. Then

the appellant got down and hit PW1 on his mouth with his fist. Three teeth

were dislocated. PW3 was arrested and released the following day.

PW5, The Judicial Medical Officer, also gave evidence. Considering his

evidence, the Learned Trial Judge had come to the conclusion that the

appellant had not caused any grievous hurt to PW1 as charged by the

prosecution.

PW7, Assistant Superintendent of Police also testified. The appellant had given

evidence from the witness stand and was subjected to cross-examination. The

defense also called a doctor who examined PW3 on the 20th of February 2009

and PW8.

The Learned Trial Judge convicted the appellant under section 314 of the Penal

Code and imposed a fine of rupees one thousand with a one-month default

term.

The grounds of appeal are as follows:

1) that the conviction is bad in law;

4

2) that the order of conviction is not supported by the evidence;

3) that the Learned High Court Judge had misdirected himself on the

burden of proof on the prosecution of a criminal case;

4) that the Learned High Court Judge has failed to analyse the

evidence properly;

5) the Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the many

discrepancies and the contradictions in the prosecution evidence;

6) the Learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the defense

evidence;

7) the Learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself on the

contradictions inter-se in the prosecution case.

The position of PW1 was that the appellant hit him on the mouth with his fist

and as a result, three of his teeth shook. However, considering the medical

evidence, the Learned Trial Judge came to the conclusion that the mobility of

the teeth was not due to the shot with the fist, but PW1 is suffering from a gum

disease known as "Periodontitis."

It is to be noted that the loosened teeth were not in one place. There were three

loose teeth on the right upper jaw and two on the left lower jaw. The evidence of

PW1 is that he already had lost some teeth before the incident happened. He

also stated that the relevant three teeth were in good condition before he was

hit. After consideration of the medical evidence, the Learned Trial Judge

decided that the mobility of teeth was not a result of the hit. There were no

external injuries at all. Also, there were no injuries to the outer or inner lip.

In the judgment, the Trial Judge has observed that the demeanor of PW1 as

follows:

PW1 had admitted that he had stated certain false statements in his affidavit to

the Supreme Court. The Learned Trial Judges assessment in this regard is as

follows:

It is very difficult to agree with these findings of the Learned Trial Judge. The

Learned Trial Judge thinks that even though PW1 had given a false statement

6

to the Supreme Court, his evidence in the High Court is reliable because of the

risk he had taken. The Learned Trial Judge says if PW1 had given a false

statement to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court must deal with it.

However, the Learned Trial Judge has failed to appreciate that such statements

were in regard to the same incident before the High Court and evidence is

contradictory. It also diminishes the creditworthiness of such evidence. On one

occasion, the Learned Trial Judge himself described PW1's evidence as an

exaggeration, and he wanted to prove somehow that the appellant was guilty.

The evidence of PW3 regarding the incident is considerably inconsistent with

the evidence of PW1. However, the Learned Trial Judge had chosen to disregard

the evidence of PW3 as an unreliable witness. The Learned Trial Judge had not

given due consideration to the contradictions between the testimony of PW1

and PW3. Even though the events described by PW1 and PW3 in their

respective testimonies are different, the Learned Trial Judge has stated that

they both say that the appellant hit PW1 and has taken that fact into

consideration without giving consideration to the substantial differences in

their evidence.

The Learned Trial Judge has applied the principle of divisibility to this effect.

For this, he has applied the principles laid down in the case of Francis

Appuhamy vs. The Queen 68 NLR 437. However, I am of the view that the

Learned Trial Judge has wrongly applied the principle laid down in this case. In

the case of Francis Appuhamy vs the Queen, there were five accused persons.

The witness had known four of the accused people for a considerable period of

time, and the fifth accused was only known to her for a relatively shorter

period. The issue at hand was regarding the identity of the fifth accused. The

Jury never came to the conclusion that the witness had given false evidence

regarding the identification of the fifth accused: but rather was of the opinion

that there was a probability of making a mistake regarding his identity. This

case does not talk about giving false evidence but the insufficiency of evidence.

7

Thus, the principles laid down in Francis Appuhamy vs. The Queen cannot be

applied to this case.

The appellant's evidence is that he was on duty at the time of this incident

when PW3 was arrested. PW3 and a few others were there. All the others had

run away except PW3. PW3 was arrested with a bundle of posters. He denied

that he had hit PW1. He further stated that he was in a Special Unit of the

Police, and he had the training to fight with or without arms. He is 5ft. 10

inches in height, and his weight is 100 Kgs. He used to carry three arms,

pistols and 100 rounds, M16 Gun, GPMC Gun, 600 rounds of ammunition, two

mines, six hand grenades, food and water. They walk 25 kms a day carrying all

these. If he had hit PW1 using his fist, he would have got severe injuries; at

least the lips would have got injured.

The Learned Trial Judge has refused his evidence for three reasons.

Firstly, the appellant could not state everything that had happened there

without looking at his notes. The Learned High Court states that as there was a

complaint against the appellant within a few days from the incident, the

appellant should be able to recollect things without looking at his notes.

I think this is not a fair comment. The ability to recollect past events varies

from person to person. The appellant did not use any notes in his evidence in

chief. He said he wanted to see his notes when he was cross-examined

extensively. Those notes were not with him. He is no longer in the Police

service. Police had the notes. The High Court Judge says that this is a mere

act. (rmEula)

As per the provisions of section 159 of the Evidence Ordinance,

'A witness may, while under examination refresh his memory by referring to

any writing made by himself at the time of transaction. The Court is concerned

8

that when he was questioned soon after the transaction had happened, it

should have been fresh in his memory.'

There is nothing wrong with the appellant's request to see his own notes to

testify before the Court. He cannot be expected to remember everything in

detail, and section 160 explicitly permits a witness to testify the

facts mentioned in the documents referred to in section 159, although he has

no recollection of the facts themselves, is sure that the facts were correctly

recorded in the document. The State Counsel used the appellant's notes, and

the statement to the ASP, to cross-examine the appellant did not show a single

contradiction.

Justice A W A Salam, President Court of Appeal, in his judgment of Karuppiah

Punkady vs. The Attorney General CA 11/2005 HC Colombo 39/00 decided 26th

of August 2014 stated that;

"In as much as the learned trial Judge had said that the evidence of the

prosecution witnesses had not been contradicted, she has failed to apply the

same yardstick with regard to the uncontradicted testimony of the accused and

her witnesses. Undoubtedly, as between the evidence of the accused and her

witnesses hardly any material contradictions had been suggested or adverted

to by the prosecution. In this respect it could be argued that the learned High

Court Judge may have forgotten to apply and give effect to the idiomatic

expression that what is sauce for the goose must be sauce for the gander as

well. If the same yardstick that was applied to the evidence of the prosecution

with regard to the absence of contradictions is equally applied to the evidence

adduced by the defence, the learned High Court Judge would have had no

alternative but to conclude that in the least degree that a reasonable doubt had

arisen with regard to the prosecution version in the light of the evidence of the

defence."

9

Taking the above judgment into consideration, when the evidence of the

defence is uncontradicted, the benefit of the same should be given to the

accused and a similar view should be taken when weighing the evidence of

both parties. In this case, the evidence of the appellant is uncontradicted.

However, the Learned Trial Judge has disregarded this fact but has considered

the contradictory evidence of prosecution witnesses. Therefore, the Learned

Trial Judge has failed to apply the same principles to the defense evidence.

Thus, the grounds on which the Learned Trial Judge has refused the

appellant's evidence cannot be accepted.

The second reason for the refusal of the evidence of the appellant is that the

defense had not put to PW3 that PW1 did not resist the arrest of PW3. PW3

only answered a leading question put by the Learned State Counsel as follows:

m%( wks;a ;a;%fhda fokakd fudkjo lf,a@ uy;ahdj f.kshkak tmd lsh,d

lshqjdo

W( fyauis uy;ahd (PW1) lshqjd" Thd f.kshkak tmd lsh,d

Thus, there was no physical resistance.

The third reason was PW3 had not violated section 74 of the Parliamentary

Election Act as PW3 did not display anything. However, PW3 himself admitted

that they were entrusted with the task of sticking posters. At the time he was

arrested, he was carrying a bundle of posters. Therefore, the view of the

Learned Trial Judge cannot be sustained.

It is to be noted that the appellant had given evidence on oath and was

subjected to extensive cross-examination. The appellant's evidence should have

been treated in the same way as the prosecution witnesses' evidence.

The Learned Trial Judge has not considered certain facts which were favorable

to the appellant. The position of PW1 is that three teeth were broken due to the

10

injury caused by the appellant. However, the Learned Trial Judge conceded

that this position was incorrect. He had not considered PW3 as a credible

witness and dismissed his evidence. PW1 admitted that he had given false

statements in the affidavit filed in the Supreme Court and further admitted

that he had lied to the Police as well. The Learned Trial Judge says that

admitting these facts shows that PW1 spoke the truth. PW1 did not admit all

that readily. After extensive cross-examination, he was made to admit them.

The learned Trial Judge considered all these facts, which plummeted the

credibility of PW1 as facts, which strengthens the evidence of PW1. On the

contrary, he has rejected the uncontradicted evidence of the appellant given

under oaths.

When considering the evidence as a whole, I am of the view that the evidence

is not sufficient to support the conviction

For the reasons stated above, appeal is allowed.

The appellant is acquitted.
