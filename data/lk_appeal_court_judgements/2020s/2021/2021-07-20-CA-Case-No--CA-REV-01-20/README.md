MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application and the Rev application 1 /20 were filed to obtain

bail pending appeal to the petitioner in the High Court cases 81/18 and

5825/11 of Colombo.

As the applications proceeded the Presidents Counsel appearing for the

petitioner submitted to Court that he would be interviewing the Attorney

General regarding their objection for bail for the petitioner, but the

Counsel appearing for the Attorney General tendered to Court that they

have no objection for the petitioner being enlarged on bail in both cases,

on suitable conditions, but the orders in the instant cases should not be

used as a precedent in other cases.

Having considered the submissions of both parties and the fact that had

the petitioner served the jail terms , in both cases he would be out of

prison by now, and the non-objection of the respondents, this Court

decides to enlarge the petitioner on bail pending the appeal on the

following conditions,

1) A cash bail of Rs 100000/ for each case, 2) Two sureties to the value of Rs 500000/ each case , 3) Petitioner to report to the relevant police station on every 4th

Sunday of each month for both cases 4) The petitioner to surrender his passport to the relevant High

Court.

The registrar of this Court to convey this order to the relevant High Court.

I agree.
