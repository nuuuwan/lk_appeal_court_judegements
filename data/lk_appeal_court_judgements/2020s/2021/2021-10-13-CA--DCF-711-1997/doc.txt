N. Bandula Karunarathna J.

The 2nd defendant-appellant (hereinafter called and referred to as the 2nd defendant) preferredthis appeal against the judgment dated 04.06.1997 of the learned Additional District Judge ofAwissawella in case No. 570/L.

The plaintiff-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the " plaintiff") instituted this action in theDistrict Court of Awissawella on the 17.07.1989 seeking inter-alia a declaration of title to the landmore fully described in the schedule of the plaint and sought further an ejectment of the 2nd

The plaintiff filed an amended plaint on the 24.03.1995. The 2nd defendant did not file anamended answer in reply to the said amended plaint. The case proceeded for trial on the saidamended plaint dated 24.03.1995 and the amended answer dated 22.02.1993.

The plaintiff by his amended plaint stated that;

The plaintiff respondent sought inter-alia a declaration that he and the 1st defendant be declaredas the owners of the subject matter of this action and sought further that the 2nd defendant beejected there from together with everyone under him.

The 2nd defendant by his amended answer dated 22.02.1993 stated that;

(a) the corpus of this action is a portion of the land called "Pussallawa Hene Deniya" in

Parties raised issues of the case on the 12.07.1996. Issue number 1 -5 were raised on behalf of theplaintiff-respondent and Issue number 6-17 by the 2nd defendant-appellant. The plaintiff gaveevidence and tendered documents marked 1 to 6, X and X1 in evidence. Documents 7 to 13 were marked by the plaintiff during the case of the 2nd defendant. The 2nd defendant gaveevidence and called Madduma Ralalage Gunesekera (Chairman of the Farmers Committee),Amarasekera Disanayakage Chithra Shelton (Chairman, Provincial Council) and HitihamilageGamini Amarasiri Bandara (cultivation officer) to testify on his behalf. The 2nd defendant tendereddocuments marked 2 1 to 2 23 in evidence.

The trial Judge delivered his judgment on the 04.06.1997 granting relief as prayed for in theamended plaint. The 2nd defendant-appellant invoked the appellate jurisdiction of this Court onthe grounds set out in paragraph 15 of the petition of appeal dated 28.07.1997.

During the course of the 2nd defendants evidence, the plaintiff produced;

(a) The petition filed by Thegis Appuhamy (the original owner of the 2nd defendant) in the

testamentary case of his own father in the District Court of Rathnapura, 779. This Case waslater transferred to District Court Awissawella and re-numbered as 5/T of 1923.

(b) The affidavit of the said Thegis Appuhamy which was filed in the same case.

(c) The inventory file in the same case.

It is evident that when these documents were shown to the 2nd defendant, he admitted thatThegis Appuhamy had got this land from his father Asgangula Pathirannahalage Appuhamy whohad died leaving a widow named Wickreme Gama Athi Ratalage Sudu Ethena and 6 children.Thegis Appuhamy was one child and the donee in 3 namely Asgangula PathirannahalageWanigasekera was another child. The 2nd defendant also admitted the land in suit was the land no.7 in the inventory marked as 9.

He also admitted that on the basis of these documents, his original owner also, had several stepsisters. He admitted that these documents show that his predecessor in title had admitted thatThegis Appuhamy's step mother Suduetana and his step brother Wanigasekera and four stepsisters, all had rights in the land in dispute. Suduetana would therefore have got of what ThegisAppuhamy's father had. As per the inventory 9 the deceased had a 1/2 share of Pussellehenedeniya. Therefore, Suduetana would, on inheritance, have got a 1/4 share.

Both parties concede the larger land called Pussellehene deniya was about one acre in extent. Onthis basis, Sudaetana's share would be around 1/4 of an acre in extent. This tallies with what isshown in plan 5. The plaintiff also produced two other deeds from the step sisters ofWanigasekera to him marked 10 & 11, although the plaintiff does not claim title on thosedeeds.

Therefore, on the admission of the 2nd defendants own predecessor in title Suduetana theplaintiffs predecessor in title had a 1/4th share in the land in suit. The 2nd defendant did notchallenge the devolution of title from Suduetana to the plaintiff.

The documents clearly show that the Land Reform Commission (LRC) had by its statutorydetermination as published in the Gazette 4 had in lieu of Wanigasekera's undivided 1/4th sharevested a divided extent of A0, R1. P 05 in his widow who was the declarant, under the LRC law.The recitals in deed no: 42 dated 25.5.1984 marked as 2 clearly spell out the relationship

Page 4 of 8

between Wanigasekera and the donors on that deed. Therefore, it is clear that the title that waswith Suduetana has now devolved on the plaintiff and the 1st defendant.

The decision of the five-judge-bench in the Supreme Court in Jinawathie and Others Vs EmalinPerera 1986 (2) SLR 121 decided that, Upon coming into operation of the Land Reform Law No. 1of 1972 on 26.08.1972, all agricultural land in excess of 50 acres became vested in the LandReform Commission in absolute title free from all encumbrances and the former owner became astatutory lessee who had to make a statutory declaration within the specified period on theprescribed form of the total extent of the agricultural land held by him as such statutory lessee. Inthe declaration the required particulars had to be furnished along with a plan or sketch plan. Theportion which the statutory lessee would prefer to retain could also be indicated.

Thereafter, the Land Reform Commission makes a statutory determination specifying the portionor portions of the land which the statutory lessee is allowed to retain. On the publication of thestatutory determination in the Gazette the Commission disentitles itself to any right or interest inthe agricultural land specified in the statutory determination from the date of such publication.

Where any agricultural land is co-owned, each co-owner was deemed by a statutory fiction to ownhis share in the co-owned land as a distinct and separate entity for the purposes of the LandReform Law. Where a person or thing is deemed to be something it only means that whereas suchperson or thing is not in reality that something the law requires him or it to be treated as if he or itwere with all the attendant consequences and incidents. The rule of eiusdem generis does notoperate to impose any limitation on the notional situation arising from the application of thedeeming provision as the enumerated classes are exhaustive of the genus.

Once the statutory determination is made the person in whose favour it was made becomesowner of the land specified in the determination with all the incidents of ownership. The landdoes not then cease to be a distinct and separate entity and it does not become once again anundivided portion of the larger land from which such specified portion was carved out. By virtueof the Amending Act No. 39 of 1981 any encumbrance which subsisted over and in respect of theundivided shares, the recipient of the statutory determination held in the larger land wouldhowever be revived. Subject to this such recipient is absolute owner of the portion of landspecified in the statutory determination vested with the jus utendi, the jus fruendi and (so far asthe law does not prohibit) the jus abutendi, the right of alienation and the right to vindicate histitle in an action at law.

On the basis of this decision even though Thegis Appuhamy and Suduetana were at one time co-owners of Pussellehene Deniya, by the statutory determination which was later published in theGazette 4 Dona Emmie Wanigasekera of Kuruppu Road (the 2nd defendant had admitted thatThegis Appuhamy's brother Wanigasekera lived at Kuruppu Road - vide page 8 of the proceedingsof 18.10.1996) became the absolute owner of that portion of it as is now depicted in plan 5.That title has passed to the plaintiff and the 1st defendant.

The plan no. 1514/66 of Allen Smith Licensed Surveyor dated 15.05.1966 marked as 2 2 showsthat the land in suit is at the extreme eastern end of that plan; but, witness Madduma RalalageGunesekera (former Chairman of the Farmers Committee), was emphatic that the 2nd defendantpossessed that portion of the land right in the middle. (Vide his evidence in re-examination on11.12.1996) This evidence puts an end to any claim he may have had to a prescriptive title, as itclearly shows that all his documents relate to another portion of Pussellehene Deniya which is

Page 5 of 8

right in the middle of the larger land depicted in Allen Smiths plan marked 2 2 and not to theland in suit.

Further, the paddy field register 12 and the inquiry notes relating to the amendment containedtherein marked 12 A clearly show that Dona Emmie Wanigasekera had in fact possessed theland in suit and it is on the basis of the fact that the cultivation committee had accepted the factthat Charles Singho had worked the same as her Anda Cultivator that the amendment soughtfor in 1983 was allowed. In fact, a witness called by the 2nd defendant on the 07.01.1997 had beenthe cultivation officer who presided at that inquiry on the 21.12.1983. (Vide 12 A).

The 2nd defendant did not oppose to this Inquiry relating to the application made by Dona EmmieWanigasekera. When perusing document marked 13 & 13 A, it does not contain anystatement by the 2nd defendant along the lines of what he gave as evidence in this present case.The 2nd defendant has not proved that he ever objected to the inclusion of the name of DonaEmmie Wanigasekera or her Anda Cultivator namely Charles Singho, who incidentally is thedonee on 2 although he admitted that the books are kept open for that purpose each year.

The 2nd defendant has failed to prove that the documents marked by him applied to the dividedportion of Pussellehene Deniya as depicted in the LRC plan 5 nor, has he succeeded in provingthat he possessed the land depicted in that plan. The evidence of his own witness has shown thathe never possessed that land.

It is crystal clear that Thegis Appuhamy the predecessor in title of the 2nd defendant -appellant didnot have absolute ownership of the disputed corpus and he was only a co-owner. According to theavailable evidence, Suduethana and Asangula Pathirennalage Wanigasekera, the predecessors ofthe plaintiff were also co-owners of the said disputed land.

Section 7 of the Land Reform Law No.1 of 1972 reads as follows;

"For the purposes of this Law, where any agricultural land is co-owned, each co- Ownershall be deemed to own his share in such land as a distinct and separate entity."

The five-judge-bench decision of the Supreme Court in Jinawathie and others vs. Emalin Perera( supra ) held that where the Land Reform Commission by a statutory determination allots to oneco-owner a defined portion of a co-owned and undivided land, that co-owner becomes theabsolute owner of the defined portion so allotted to him.

It was held at page 128 of the same judgement;

"It is, however, necessary in this case to consider the operation of the provisions detailedabove in regard to a person, whose extent of agricultural land over and above the saidceiling of 50 acres does not constitute a distinct and separate entity but comprises onlyundivided interests in a larger land, which he is entitled to only in common with severalother persons, all or several of whom, however, do not own interests over and above thesaid ceiling. Sec. 7 of this Law is the provision which has to be resorted to in such asituation. The provision of this section requires, by the use of a statutory fiction, theinterests of a co-owner, which would, at the time this Law comes into operation be only anundivided share of a larger land owned in common, to be treated as a distinct andseparate entity. "(Emphasis added)

It was further held at page 129 of the same judgement;

Page 6 of 8

"...The moment this Law comes into operation the undivided share of a co-owner, whetherhe be one whose interests are over fifty acres or not, becomes, in the eye of the law, adistinct and separate entity, equal to the undivided extent he was earlier entitled to in thecommon land. Such entity is, at that time, still not identified or located on the ground, asdistinct from the larger land. It is, at that stage, as learned Counsel submitted, onlynotional, and only confined to paper. By the use of this fiction undivided interests aretreated as divided, and a co-owner is treated as the sole owner of a distinct entity, in orderto set the provisions of this Law in motion. The effect of the operation of the provisions ofsec. 7 is to bring about a separation or partition of the undivided share of a person, who, atthe time this Law comes into operation, owns such interests in common with severalothers, and transform such undivided share into a distinct and separate portion. Eventhough still only notional and only existing on paper, yet, the law requires the extent ofland such person is entitled to, to be treated as a distinct and separate entity" (emphasisadded)

In a vindicatory action the plaintiff must himself have title to the property in dispute. The burdenis on the plaintiff to prove that he has title to the disputed property, and that such title is superiorto the title, if any, put forward by the defendant in occupation. The plaintiff can and must succeedonly on the strength of his own title, and not upon the weakness of the defence. In considerationof the foregoing principle relating to the legal concept of ownership, and to an action reivindication, it seems to me that the plaintiff-respondent did, at the time of the institution of theseproceedings, have, "sufficient" title which he could have vindicated against the 2nd defendant-appellant in proceedings such as these.

It was decided in Subramaniam v. Sivarajah 46 NLR 540 that, the Court presumed an ouster fromthe fact that one co-owner was in possession of the entire land and took the profits exclusivelyand continuously for a period of over 60 years without accounting to the other co-owners wholived in close proximity under circumstances which indicated a denial of a right to the other co-owners to take or receive them.

In the present case, however, the facts are different. The co-owners are in possession of differentallotments of the co-owned land.

Section 11 of the Act No 14 of 1986, Land Reform (Special Provisions) Act is as follows;

Insertion of new section 59A in the principal enactment.

11. The following new section is inserted immediately after section 59, and shall have effectas section 59A of the principal enactment;

Prescription Ordinance not to apply to lands vested in the Commission.

59A. No person shall, by possession or user of any agricultural land or estate land vested inthe Commission, acquire any prescriptive title to any such land and neither the PrescriptionOrdinance nor any other law relating to the acquisition of rights by virtue of possession oruser shall apply to any such land unless undisturbed and uninterrupted adverse possessionfor a period of over one third of a century is proved by such person.

The learned counsel for the 2nd defendant filed his written submission on the 10.02.1997, after thetrial was concluded. In that written submission the learned counsel has indicated on behalf of hisclient, as follows;

Page 7 of 8

1966 30 , . 2 .

When considering the above section 59A of the amended Land Reform Commission Act, to claimprescriptive rights the 2nd defendant-appellant in the present case should have proved that he washaving at least 34 years of undisturbed, uninterrupted and adverse possession against theplaintiff. According to the above-mentioned paragraph of the written submission filed in theDistrict Court by the learned counsel for the 2nd defendant, he had only 30 years of prescriptiverights.

Learned Counsel for the 02nd Defendant Appellant argued that the Statutory Determination by theLRC had been gazetted on 21.06.1991 and the Plaintiff had purchased the land as claimed by him,in the year 1986 from Charlis Sinngho. The date of the institution of the instant action was on17.07.1989. It was further argued for the 02nd Defendant Appellant that as the Plaintiff did nothave any title at the time of instituting the action, the plaint was liable to be dismissed.

It is my view that this case proceeded for trial on the amended plaint dated 24.03.1995. Thus,there is no merit of the said argument on behalf of the 2nd Defendant Appellant.

The Land Reform Commission by its order published in the Extra Ordinary Gazette notice bearingnumber 667/14 dated 21.06.1991 made statutory declaration under S.19 of the Land Reform Law(vide 4) allowing Emmie Wanigasekera to retain a specific portion of land called PussellaheneDeniya. Therefore, to succeed in his claim, the 2nd defendant should have proved that he washaving, prescriptive rights for 34 years; undisturbed, uninterrupted and adverse possessionagainst the plaintiff, prior to 21.06.1991.

For the foregoing reasons, I am of the opinion that the plaintiff-respondent's action is entitled tosucceed.

The appeal of the 2nd defendant-appellant is, accordingly, dismissed with costs.

The judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Awissawella dated 04.06.1997 isaffirmed.
