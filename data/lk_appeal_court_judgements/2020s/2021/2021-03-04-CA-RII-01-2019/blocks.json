It is the case of the Petitioner that the Respondents had made an attempt to hold the Annual General Meeting of the society with the participation of a group of people who had been granted the membership of the society unlawfully in the previous year. Thereafter, the Petitioner had sought for an interim injunction from the District Court of Tangalle preventing same. Earlier the Petitioner had instituted action No. SPL 417 in the District Court of Bandarawela for a similar purpose. The District Court of Tangalle had issued an enjoining order in the first instance and issued notice of interim injunction on the Respondents. Thereafter the Petitioner and the Respondents were negotiating with the view of reaching a settlement with regard to the holding of the Annual General Meeting of the 1st Respondent society and these negotiations had led the Petitioner and the Respondents to the conclusion that the two cases pending in the District Court of Tangalle and the District Court of Bandarawela were an obstacle to making progress in their effort to resolve the dispute amicably. Therefore, the Petitioner and the Respondents had agreed not to proceed with the two cases. When this case had come up in the District Court of Tangalle on 13.03.2018 the agreement reached by the parties was placed before Court and the Petitioner had moved to withdraw the case on the condition that the Respondents undertake to withdraw their claim in reconvention in the Bandarawela case.",

As stated by Basnayake CJ in Cornelius Perera vs Leo Perera 62 NLR 413 Where a statute provides special machinery which if resorted to renders a decree final, the finality prescribed in the Act does not attach to a decree unless there is a clear manifestation of a conscious intension of the parties to resort to that machinery with a knowledge of the consequences it involves and there has been a strict compliance with the requirements of the statute.

That agreement completely cuts across the Plaintiffs case. The plaintiff had come to court to prevent the Respondents from holding the Annual General Meeting with the participation of the members who had been granted membership unlawfully in 2017. While the case was pending the Plaintiff Petitioner and the Defendant Respondents were negotiating to arrive at an amicable settlement and those negotiations are still continuing. The Plaintiff Petitioner had decided to withdraw the action pending in the District Court because both the Plaintiff and the Defendants had thought that this case was an obstacle to making progress in their effort to resolve the dispute amicably. Therefore, it is highly improbable that the Plaintiff Petitioner would have agreed to accept the additional condition incorporated into the settlement. Therefore, on a balance of probability of the evidence one can accept the version of the Plaintiff Petitioner that the Attorney at Law who represented him had acted contrarily to authority as the additional condition was not a part of the agreement entered into between the parties and that the Attorney at Law for the Plaintiff Petitioner had consented to this additional condition purely by mistake. When one examines the content of the proceedings on 13.03.2018 it is apparent that the additional condition had been incorporated into the settlement subsequently. It was not a part of the original settlement. After the terms of the original settlement were recorded the Attorney at Law for the Defendants has made an attempt to incorporate these additional terms",
