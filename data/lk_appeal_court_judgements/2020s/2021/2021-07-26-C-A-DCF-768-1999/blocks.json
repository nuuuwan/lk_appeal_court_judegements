One of the ways in which it could be achieved is by having recourse to a legally prepared preliminary plan and a report. In the absence of such a plan and report court may unconsciously extend a helping hand to collusion against the rest of the world which can take away the sanctity attached to a final decree. Hence, it is totally unsafe to decide on the corpus with the help of a plan and report prepared outside the Legislative guidance shown under Section 16 and 18.",
