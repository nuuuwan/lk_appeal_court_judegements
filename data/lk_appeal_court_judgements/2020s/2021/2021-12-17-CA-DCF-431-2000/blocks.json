According to what is stated in the Surveyors Report marked X1, the 6th Defendant who was a new claimant before the surveyor had stated that the Lot No. 2 of the Preliminary Plan is a portion of Pambewatte which means Pambewatte is situated to the south of the corpus and adjoining it. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities one can come to the conclusion that the land to the south of the Public road shown as the southern boundary in the Preliminary Plan is Pambewatte and before the construction of that road, Pambewatte was the southern boundary of the corpus as described in the schedule to the Plaint: Commissioner had stated in evidence that there was no necessity for him to show Pambewatte in the Preliminary Plan.

The extent of the land surveyed and shown in the Preliminary Plan is 4A, 2R, 14.5P and the extent of the land described in the schedule to the Plaint is six Palas and 3 Lases of paddy ( ). It is the submission of the learned Counsel for the 5th Defendant-Appellant that the extent of six Palas and 3 Lases of paddy is equivalent to 3 Acres 3 Roods and 30 Perches and therefore, there is a difference of 104.5 perches between the two extents. The extent of the land shown in the Preliminary Plan is 104.5 perches more than the extent of the land described in the schedule. This can happen in the circumstances of this case. The land described in the schedule to the Plaint is not a land that had been described with reference to a Survey Plan. That means the extent referred to in the schedule to the Plaint is an extent that had been roughly calculated without surveying the land. In a situation like that the actual extent of the land can differ from the extent that had been roughly calculated without a survey.",

The 1st Defendant had cultivated the high land and the paddy field attached to it and her sons had been residing in the land. Prior to 1977, the 1st Defendants husband had been in possession of the land and he had cultivated the land on an informal lease. Thereafter, the 1st Defendant had purchased rights from the owners of Tikittadeniyahena on the basis that the land is Tikittadeniyahena. That shows that the deeds produced by the Plaintiff (was) were acted upon and the 1st Defendant and her predecessors in title had possessed this land as Tikittadeniyahena.
