Both parties agreed to conclude the case by way of written submissions. Anyhow none of the parties have filed the written submissions. There are several connected matters that were taken up together with this matter. The court observers that the facts relating to each are different. The Petitioner states that she was a teacher and retired as a principal. While the Petitioner was serving, she has been given a house at Daanyagama Housing Scheme in Trincomalee, upon a Lease Agreement entered into between the Petitioner and the Food Commissioner in which, even after her retirement she continues to remain as a resident. The Petitioner states that she has complied with all terms and conditions of the above-mentioner Lease Agreement up to date. Later on, the Respondent had taken steps to obtain back the possession of the said house and accordingly, proceedings had been instituted before the Magistrate Court of Trincomalee against the Petitioner in order to recover the possession of the house in issue in terms of the Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act. Nevertheless, said action has been later withdrawn by the Food Commissioner. Thereafter, the Respondent has issued the purported quit notice dated 18.02.2019 (P3) against the Petitioner requiring her to hand over the vacant possession of the premises in issue claiming that the Petitioner has acted in breach of the Lease Agreement. In spite of such circumstances, the Petitioner has lodged this Petition before this Court moving for a Writ of Certiorari quashing the quit notice marked P3 stating that the purported quit notice is bad in law for the reasons mentioned below.",
