Before: M. T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. & K. K. A. V. SWARNADHIPATHI, J.

Counsel: Tharanga Edirisingha for the 1st Defendant - Appellant

Samantha Vithanage with Hiranaya Fernando for Plaintif- Respondants

Argument: By written submission

Date of Judgment: 15.11.2021. K.K.A.V. SWARNADHIPATHI, J.

JUDGEMENT Plaintiff-Respondent filed case No.5370/P in the District Court of Horana to partition the land

more fully described in the schedule to the Plaint. The preliminary survey was carried out, and

the plan and report were submitted to the court. At the trial, all parties admitted the preliminary

plan and report. At the outset of the case, a Lis pendant was registered.

Therefore, on the face of it, there is no dispute regarding the corpus. However, both parties raised

points of contest, and the trial proceeded, and the judgment was pronounced on 29th October

1997. The 1st Defendant, who was aggrieved by that judgment, filed an appeal in this court to

set aside the judgment.

All parties agreed to dispose of the argument by way of written submissions. The aggrieved 1st

Defendant-Appellant took the position that the learned District Judge had failed to evaluate

evidence properly. Right throughout the case, the 1st Defendant-Appellant had admitted the

corpus. His main dispute is regarding the devolution of title to the corpus.

The Appellant contends that the footing taken by the learned District Judge that one of the

original owners, namely Phillip, had died unmarried and his siblings were his heirs was against

Page 4 of 6

the evidence. Throughout the case, the 1st Defendant stated that Phillip was married and had

children.

Mere saying that Phillip was married is not sufficient to prove that he was married. It was the

duty of the party who proposed that such a marriage existed. The fact should be proved by

producing the marriage certificate or calling witnesses to satisfy the court. The judge, evaluating

evidence, had accepted the majority version, which is more compatible with the evidence.

According to the 1st Defendant-Appellant, she was an only child. Her father, Kuruppu

Arachchige Don Surabiel, married Wikramage Joselin Nona. According to the claim of the 9th

to 12th Defendants, their parents are the same as that of the 1st Defendant-Appellant. They further

state that Surabiel and Joselin Nona had six children, including the 1st Defendant.

In cross-examination, the 1st Defendant had admitted that there were seven children to Joscelin

and Kuruppu Arachchige Surabiel, including herself. In a partition action, all Defendants are

treated as Plaintiffs as well.

Therefore, Defendant must disclose all material facts to the court. The 1st Defendant-Appellant

admitted that she did not disclose her siblings even though they are also people who stand to

inherit from the parents. Even the learned District Judge had pointed this out in his judgment.

The Plaintiff in his Plaint very clearly indicated that Phillip died unmarried and his heirs were

his siblings. The 1st Defendant's statement of claim gives the same names as the children of

Phillip. However, evidence had very clearly indicated that they are not children but siblings of

Phillip.

1st, Defendant-Appellant fails regarding Phillip heirs. It is a proven fact that Phillip died

unmarried and issueless. The learned District Judge had very correctly analyzed that part of the

evidence.

The second main argument of the 1st Defendant-Appellant is that the learned District Jude had

decided that Deed No.14251 dated 29.12.1986 attested by S.P.D. Kulasekera, marked as [P1],

Page 5 of 6

gets prior registration over Deed No.2708 dated 08.09.1989 attested by Sumanadasa

Wickramasinghe.

The learned District Judge had discussed this matter in depth in writing the judgment. He had

given reasons why he considered Plaintiff's Deed over the 1st Defendant's Deed. The document

marked [P1] deed No.14251 was written on 29th December 1986. From that day onwards, the

seller Kuruppu Arachchige Adwin Appuhamy had no title to the land he had already sold. The

property now becomes the property of Gamage Wimaladasa.

Therefore, the said Adwin cannot again sell the exact property to the 1st Defendant. When

comparing both Deeds, Kuruppu Arachchige Adwin had transferred his entire ownership to

Gamage Wimaladasa by Deed14251. Since he had transferred his ownership in 1986, he cannot

write another Deed in 1989.

It is on that ground that the learned District Judge had accepted the 1st Deed.Another argument

by the Appellant is that the learned District Judge had not considered Deed No.14419 marked as

[1V8] when calculating shares.

The 1st Defendant had not raised any point of contest regarding Deed No.14419. However,

evidence shows that Bastian had transferred all his shares to Mary Nona by [P2]. Therefore,

when perusing the Deed of gift marked as [P2], it is evident that Kuruppu Arachchige Don

Bastian Appuhamy had gifted his entire property to Dona Mary Nona Kuruppuhamine.

Therefore, the learned District Judge's conclusion that [1v8] cannot be considered as the property

covered by [1V8] had already passed over by [P2] is correct.

In reasoning out as above, I see no reason to disturb the judgment already entered. However, in

the judgment, the learned District Judge had stated that he allocated shares according to the

settlement entered by parties on 11.01.1996.

In Perusing the proceedings of 11.01.1996, there is no settlement recorded. Therefore, I

consider that it is not necessary to mention that fact in the judgment. Other than that part of the

Page 6 of 6

sentence "According to the settlement entered among the parties on 11.01.1996", I affirm the

rest of the judgment.

I dismiss the Appeal of the 1st Defendant-Appellant subject to taxed cost.

The registrar of this court is directed to communicate this judgment to the District Court of

Horana and remit the case record.
