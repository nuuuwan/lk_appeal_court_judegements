Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the accused-appellant (Hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence of him by the

learned High Court judge of Anuradhapura.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Anuradhapura for

committing the offence of murder by shooting of one Amara Thennakoon who

was his wife, an offence punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code.

This is an offence said to have been committed on 18th January 2001. After

trial without a jury, the appellant was found guilty as charged by the learned

High Court judge by his judgment dated 01-04-2019, and was sentenced to

death accordingly.

As there were no eye witnesses to the actual crime, this is a matter that has

been determined entirely on circumstantial evidence.

Page 3 of 16

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned counsel for the appellant urged the

following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

(1) That the learned trial judge erred in law by failing to consider the well

settled law and judicial pronouncements relating to a case entirely

based on circumstantial evidence.

(2) That the learned trial judge wrongly applied the Ellenborough

principle.

(3) That the learned trial judge failed to consider suspicious

circumstances does not establish guilt.

(4) That the learned trial judge did not evaluate the defence evidence

from the correct perspective and rejected the same in the wrong

premise.

Before considering the grounds of appeal in detail, I would now briefly

summarize the relevant facts of the matter.

The appellant and his wife, the deceased, lived in the village of Maha Kakirawa

in the Kakirawa area with their two children. According to the evidence of

Palisge Wimalaratne (PW-06) who was a neighbour and a relative, on the early

morning of the day of the incident (18-01-2001) he received a message that the

appellant Dissanayakes wife was shot dead. It was his evidence that on the

16th of January the appellant came to meet him and sought his help to secure

a gun saying that he is in need of a gun to protect a treasure available in his

paddy field. As the owner of the paddy field he was cultivating, namely

Ranasinghe, has a gun, it was PW-06 who has persuaded the said Ranasinghe

(PW-07) to handover the gun to him on the pretext of needing the same to

protect the crops of the paddy field. After taking over the gun from its owner,

the PW-06 has handed it over to the appellant and had received the

information of the death of the deceased the following morning. The witness

says that he and his family went to the house of the deceased, but he did not

Page 4 of 16

enter the compound and waited outside. It was his evidence that the appellant

attempted to speak to him several times and when he eventually spoke to him,

he asked the appellant what was done. In reply, the appellant has informed the

PW-06 that the gun is near the Katakala tree in the paddy field belonging to

Prithis mother and asked him to remove it from that place.

After daybreak, PW-06 has gone to the place indicated by the appellant to find

the gun as indicated, which he has not touched. Subsequently the owner of the

gun (PW-07) had come looking for his gun upon hearing of the shooting and

after being informed that the gun was given to the appellant and the place

where it can be found, it was Ranasinghe (PW-07) who has retrieved the gun

and taken it to his house.

It was the evidence of PW-07 the owner of the gun that because of the constant

pleading of PW-06 who was his tenant cultivator, he gave the gun to him in

order to protect the crops on the 17th at around 8.00 pm along with some

cartridges. After receiving information that the wife of Dissanayake has been

shot dead the following day, and suspecting some foul play, he has gone

looking for his gun and has been informed by PW-06 about the place where the

gun can be found. After retrieving the gun from where it was, (production

marked P-01 at the trial), it has been cleaned by the witness and has handed

over to the Police subsequently when the Police came looking for it.

PW-02 Ranjith Dissanayake was the son of the appellant and the deceased,

who lived with his parents and the sister in the house where the shooting took

place. He was about 16 years of age at the time. He has gone to bed as usual

on the fateful day and in the early hours of the 18th he was awakened by an

echoing sound from inside the house. He has found that there was no

electricity in the house. Later he has been informed by his sister that their

father informed her that the mother has been shot. Upon informing the

incident to his relatives who lived nearby, the witness has found that the

electrical cutout which was near the electricity meter had been removed. He

Page 5 of 16

had seen his mother with bleeding injuries inside a mosquito net (P-02) laid

onto the bed where she was sleeping with his father. The witness has also seen

a wooden pole near the open window of the room. He has also spoken about

the disputes his mother and father had due to an illicit relationship of his

father.

Confirming the evidence of PW-02, his sister PW-03 has stated that when she

went into the parents room hearing a loud noise, she found her father in the

room with a torch as there was a power outage. Upon inquiry, he had informed

her that somebody shot the mother and he is going to find a vehicle before

leaving the house.

The evidence of PW-12, IP Gamini Fernando, who was the Officer in Charge

(OIC) of Kekirawa Police crime investigation division at the time of the incident

is of paramount importance in this matter. He has received the first complaint

regarding the shooting incident from the appellant and has conducted the main

investigation as to the matter. He has found highly suspicious the appellants

information as to what happened on that day. Although the appellant has

explained that someone from outside shot at his wife from the open window of

the room, on inspection, he has found that was not possible as the window was

at a much higher elevation than the ground. Furthermore, when comparing the

burn mark that was visible on the mosquito net and the wound of the

deceased, he has found that the firing has to be from inside the room from

towards the door and not the window as claimed by the appellant. After

arresting the appellant, the PW-12 has taken steps to record his statement,

and as a result has found the cutout of the electrical connection hidden near

the house.

The relevant part of the appellant's statement that led to the discovery of the

cutout has been marked under the provisions of section 27 of the Evidence

Ordinance as P-04, and the said cutout as P-05 at the trial.

Page 6 of 16

PW-13 was the then OIC of the Kekirawa Police. He has also well explained the

findings of PW-12, and was also the person who recovered the weapon marked

P-01 from the possession of PW-07 Ranasinghe.

PW-10 was the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who has conducted the post-

mortem examination on the deceased. He has found that the death was due to

gunshot injuries suffered by the deceased. After examining the entry wound of

the deceased, he has found that the firing has to be from a close range of about

18 inches from the body of the deceased. He has also ruled out the possibility

of someone from outside the room window from firing at the deceased. I find

that the JMO has well explained his findings before the High Court using his

professional expertise as a Judicial Medical Officer.

When the appellant was called for a defence at the conclusion of the

prosecution case, he has chosen to make a statement from the dock and to call

a witness. In his statement he has admitted that he persuaded PW-06 to obtain

the gun from PW-07, but has taken up the position that it was obtained to be

given to one Wijeratne, and he left the gun near the house of Wijeratne for him

to take and went home to retire to bed. According to the appellant, he has

heard a gun shot in the night while sleeping and had found his wife who was

sleeping alongside him with bleeding injuries. It was his stand that there was

no power at that time and after seeing the wifes injuries he went to his

neighbour Godakanda madams house in order to seek her help. It was his

position that as she refused to come out of the house he went to the Police with

the help of another neighbour and lodged a complaint. He has claimed that

although he informed the Police that he suspects Wijeratne to whom he gave

the gun, police arrested him and got his signature to a document after

assaulting him.

Giving evidence for the defence, the above mentioned Pathmalatha Godakanda

who was a neighbour and a medical practitioner of the area has confirmed that

the appellant came to her house on the day of the incident and informed that

Page 7 of 16

his wife has met with an issue and his house has been burgled, seeking her

help. She has refused to come out of the house since it was night time and has

been informed subsequently that the wife of the appellant has been shot dead.

It appears that the stand taken throughout the trial by the appellant was that

someone shot his wife from outside the house and he has nothing to do with it.

However, the learned High Court judge has found that his stand has not

created any doubt on the evidence presented by the prosecution as to his

culpability to the crime. Based on the circumstantial evidence, the appellant

was found guilty as charged by the learned High Court judge.

Grounds of Appeal

As the first three grounds of appeal urged by the learned counsel for the

appellant are interrelated, I will now consider them together in order to

consider whether they have any merit.

1st 2nd and the 3rd Grounds of Appeal: -

I am unable to find any material contradictions inter say or per say on the

evidence led in this action. I do not find any reasons to believe that the

witnesses were not telling the truth or making any attempt to distort their

version of events. There are no reasons to disagree with the professional

opinions expressed by the JMO and the Government analyst who inspected the

gun used in the crime, or reasons to disbelieve the observations of the Police

officers who conducted investigations into the crime.

With the above factual situations in mind, I now consider the legal principles

that should be considered by a trial judge in an action of this nature, where the

matter has been decided principally on circumstantial evidence.

Page 8 of 16

In the case of The King Vs. Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254 it was held:

Per Soertsz J.

In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the jury must be

satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the accused

and inconsistent with any reasonable hypotheses of his innocence.

In Don Sunny Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 01 it was held:

1) When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the

proved items of circumstantial evidence when taken together must

irresistibly point towards only inference that the accused committed the

offence. On consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can

be arrived at should be consistent with the guilt of the accused only.

2) If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence, if an

inference can be drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the

accused, then one cannot say that the charges have been proved

beyond reasonable doubt.

3) If upon consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence if

the only inference that can be drawn is that the accused committed the

offence, then they can be found guilty. The prosecution must prove that

no one else other than the accused had the opportunity of committing

the offence. The accused can be found guilty only if the proved items of

circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt and inconsistent

with their innocence.

A trial judge also has to be mindful that suspicious circumstances do not

establish guilt and the burden of proving a case beyond reasonable doubt

against an accused is always with the prosecution.

Page 9 of 16

In the case of The Queen Vs. M.G. Sumanasena 66 NLR 350 it was held:

In a criminal case suspicious circumstances do not establish guilt. Nor

does the proof of any number of suspicious circumstances relieve the

prosecution of its burden of proving the case against the accused beyond

reasonable doubt and compel the accused to give or call evidence

However, in considering the circumstantial evidence, what has to be considered

is the totality of the circumstantial evidence before coming to a firm finding as

to the guilt of an accused, although each piece of circumstantial evidence when

taken separately may only be suspicious in nature.

In the case of The King Vs. Gunaratne 47 NLR 145 it was held:

In a case of circumstantial evidence, the facts given in evidence may,

taken cumulatively, be sufficient to rebut the presumption of innocence,

although each fact, when taken separately, may be a circumstance only of

suspicion.

The jury is entitled to draw inferences unfavourable to an accused where

he is not called to establish an innocent explanation of evidence given by

the prosecution, which, without such explanation, tells for his guilt.

In the case of Regina Vs. Exall (176 English Reports, Nisi Prius at page

853) Pollock, C.B., considering the aspect of circumstantial evidence remarked;

It has been said that circumstantial evidence is to be considered as a

chain, and each piece of evidence as a link in a chain, but that is not so,

for then, if any one link brock, the chain would fall. It is more like the of a

rope composed of several cords. One strand of the rope might be

Page 10 of 16

insufficient to sustain the weight, but three stranded together may be quite

of sufficient strength.

I find that in this action the circumstantial evidence can be separated as to

what happened before the actual shooting and what happened afterwards. The

appellant in his dock statement has admitted that it was he who persuaded

PW-06 to secure a gun for him, and how it was secured. Although it was his

position that it was given to a third person, when the relevant witnesses gave

evidence, that proposition has not been put to them on behalf of the appellant.

On the day of the incident when the daughter of the appellant went into the

room of the house where the parents occupied after hearing a loud sound, the

appellant has been in the room and there was no electrical power in the house.

The appellant has informed his daughter that the mother was shot by someone

and has left the house apparently to seek help. It was the appellant who has

made the first complaint to the Police, claiming that someone shot his wife

through the window of the house.

However, it has been found that there was no possibility for someone to fire at

the deceased from outside the house through the window as claimed by the

appellant in his complaint to the Police as the window was of much higher

elevation from the ground. Upon further investigation, the inquiring officer has

found that the actual firing has been from within the room itself. He has

formed this opinion by observing the burn marks of the bullet entry point of

the mosquito net which covered the bed of the victim and her wounds. The

JMO who conducted the post-mortem has opined that the victim has been shot

from a range of about 18 inches of her body which has confirmed the

observations of the Police. PW-06 has given clear evidence that after the

incident, the appellant came to him and informed where the gun can be found

and requested that the gun be removed from the place where it was. PW-07,

who was the owner of the gun has confirmed the evidence of PW-06 as to the

finding of the gun. It clearly appears that the appellants stance in his dock

Page 11 of 16

statement that he left the gun for some other person to collect was an

afterthought in order to counter the evidence of PW-06.

The appellants own son PW-02 has given evidence as to the relationship the

appellant had with his wife, although he has made an attempt to show that

everything was fine between them. The sons evidence had not been counted in

any acceptable manner, and when taken together with other circumstantial

evidence, although it is not necessary to prove the motive, I find enough

motivation for the appellant to remove his wife from his life.

Although it was the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the

learned trial judge has failed to consider the circumstantial evidence in its

correct perspective and the judgment has been based on suspicious

circumstance, I am unable to agree. It is very much apparent from the

judgment that the learned trial judge was mindful of the relevant legal

principles emphasized before. There is no basis to consider that the verdict has

been reached based on suspicious circumstances as the learned trial judge was

mindful that such circumstances do not establish guilt. I am of the view that

this is a case where all the circumstantial evidence when taken cumulatively

points directly towards the culpability of the appellant for the crime and

nothing else.

It is well settled law that in such a scenario, an accused person only has to

create a reasonable doubt as to the evidence against him, or at least offer a

reasonable explanation, since there is no duty cast on an accused in a criminal

trial, and it was the prosecution who must prove its case beyond reasonable

doubt.

I do not find any basis to consider that there was any doubt as to the evidence

led in this action or any reasonable explanation given as to the incriminating

circumstantial available evidence against the appellant.

Page 12 of 16

For the aforementioned reasons I find no merit in the three grounds of appeal

urged.

4th Ground of Appeal: -

It was the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the learned

trial judge has failed to consider the evidence led on behalf of the accused, as

the learned trial judge has considered the evidence on the basis that the

appellant has failed to call any evidence to support his stance taken at the

trial. It was his stand that even the dock statement has not been considered in

its correct perspective as the learned trial judge has gone on the basis that the

appellant claimed that he was unaware about the shooting of his wife, whereas

it was not.

It was his view that this obvious non consideration of evidence has caused a

great prejudice to the appellant, which amounts to a denial of a fair trial, and

hence, this is a matter that should be sent for a re-trial.

It was the position of the learned ASG for the Attorney General that what needs

to be considered is whether these lapses on the part of the learned trial judge

have caused any prejudice to the appellant. Citing the proviso to Article 138 of

the Constitution, which confers the appellate jurisdiction to the Court of

Appeal from the Courts of first instance and the case of Mannar Mannan Vs.

The Republic of Sri Lanka (1990) 1SLR 280 and other relevant legal

principles, it was his argument that there exists no need for a retrial. Even if

the dock statement and the evidence called on behalf of the appellant was

considered in the proper manner, it was his view that there cannot be a

different outcome to the judgment of the learned trial judge as it would not

have created a reasonable doubt or a reasonable explanation as to the evidence

against the appellant.

Page 13 of 16

The proviso of Article 138 of the Constitution reads as follows;

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

In Mannar Mannan Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (Supra):

In a trial on a charge of murder, two eyewitnesses testified to seeing the

accused appellant fire one shot with a gun at the deceased in the night.

The accused in a statement from the dock denied he was anywhere in the

vicinity of the shooting. The trial judge failed to direct the jury that it was

sufficient for the appellant to secure an acquittal if the statement from

the dock raised a reasonable doubt in regard to the allegation of the

prosecution that it was the appellant who shot the deceased.

Held:

The enacting part of sub-section (1) of section 334 mandates the Court to

allow the appeal where-

(a) The verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having

regard to the evidence; or

(b) There is a wrong decision on any question of law; or

(c) There is a miscarriage of justice on any ground.

The proviso vests discretion In the Court and recourse to it arises only

where the appellant has made out at least one of the grounds postulated

in the enacting part of the sub-section. There is no warrant for the view

that the Court is precluded from applying the proviso in any particular

Page 14 of 16

category of wrong decision or misdirection on questions of law as for

instance, burden of proof.

There is no hard and fast rule that the proviso is inapplicable where

there is non-direction amounting to misdirection in regard to the burden

of proof. What is important is that each case falls to be decided on the

consideration of

(a) The nature and intent of the non-direction amounting to a

misdirection on the burden of proof

(b) All facts and circumstances of the case, the quality of evidence

adduced and the weight to be attached to it.

In the case of Lafeer Vs. Queen 74 NLR 246, H.N.G.Fernando, C.J. stated;

There was thus both misdirection and non-direction on matters concerning

the standard of proof. Nevertheless, we are of opinion having regard to the

cogent and uncontradicted evidence that a jury properly directed could not

have reasonably returned a more favourable verdict. We therefore affirm

the conviction and sentence and dismiss the appeal.

Both the above mentioned are cases where the trial at the High Court was

before a jury, and decided in appeal under section 334 of the Criminal

Procedure Code, which has similar provisions to Article 138 of the Constitution

in the section itself. I find that the principles discussed in the said appeals are

of equal relevance to a determination of an appeal under the provisions of

section 335 of the Criminal Procedure Code of a trial held without a jury before

the High Court in view of the Proviso to Article 138 of the Constitution.

Page 15 of 16

When it comes to the appeal under consideration, it is true that the learned

High Court judge has misdirected himself as to the stand taken by the

appellant in his dock statement and on the witness called on behalf of the

accused.

In his judgment, the learned trial judge has wrongly determined at page 11 of

the judgment (page 282 of the brief), that the appellants stand was that he did

not know anything about the shooting. Whereas, his stand throughout the trial

had been that someone shot his wife from outside of the house through the

open window.

Although the learned trial judge has determined that the appellant failed to

call any witnesses, in fact, one Pathmalatha Godakanda who was a medical

practitioner and a neighbour of the appellant has testified that on the day of

the incident, the appellant came to her house in the night. He had informed

that his house had been burgled and his wife faced with an incident, wanting

to have her van. She has declined because it was night time and she was alone,

telling the appellant to go and seek help from some other person.

In view of the above, what has to be determined in this appeal is whether the

mentioned lapses by the learned trial judge have occasioned a failure of justice,

which warrants the intervention of this Court.

As discussed before, there are overwhelming circumstantial evidence against

the appellant beyond reasonable doubt as to his guilt of the crime. Even if the

dock statement and the stand taken by the appellant at the trial was to be

considered on its merits, no acceptable explanation or any doubt would have

been created as to the evidence of the prosecution. When it comes to the

evidence of the witness called by the appellant, if considered, it would only

show that the appellant went to the house of the witness after the incident.

Page 16 of 16

This appears to be an attempt to show that he was a concerned husband and

to mislead.

For the reasons as stated above, I find no merit in the ground urged either, as

it has not caused any material prejudice to the appellant and occasioned a

failure of justice.

The appeal therefore is dismissed. The conviction and the sentence affirmed.
