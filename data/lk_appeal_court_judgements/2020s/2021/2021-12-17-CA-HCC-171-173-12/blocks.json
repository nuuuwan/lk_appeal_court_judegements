The assailant was intimately known to Rakkha Singh and the witness had heard the appellant's voice speaking about the dispute which was pending between him and the appellant. We do not think that the circumstance that Rakkha Singh had not seen the face of the appellant when the latter was running away is a ground for discarding his testimony.

As it is an item of circumstantial evidence and circumstantial evidence should not be acted upon to the detriment of the accused unless the inference that could be drawn from the evidence is consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with any other reasonable hypothesis.

Given the seriousness of the crime, we need to understand how traumatic, painful, and excruciating it must have been for one of the two eyewitnesses to be seriously injured when six people were hacked to death in the same house. This court should consider very carefully whether Chaminda had the courage to tell the doctor the names of the perpetrators when he gave the brief history at the time of his admission to the hospital. It should not be considered a shortcoming or a mistake for a victim to be able to bear the pain of his or her trauma and reflect on that ordeal. It is not surprising that someone who has had to deal with such a shock will forget how or by whom the crime was committed for the same reason. Therefore, a person suffering from an injury cannot be accused of being a liar simply because there was a gap or omission in what he initially told the doctor on admission to the hospital.",
