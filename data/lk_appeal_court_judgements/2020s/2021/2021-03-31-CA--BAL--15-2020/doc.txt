Argued On: 18/ 03/ 2021

Decided On: 31/03/2021

MENAKAWIJESUNDERA J.

The suspect respondents (herein after referred to as respondents) have been

produced under the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and

Witnesses Act nu 04 of 2015 under BR840 for threatening Karawilakande

Karunawathi and her husband and causing hurt to them in order to force them

to withdraw their daughters complaint that she was sexually assaulted and

kidnapped by the first respondent under BR 39605, and the complaint had been

lodged on 5.12.19 whereas the alleged threat had taken place on 7.11.2019.

Therefore the position of the respondents is that the complaint instrumental

for the instant application has been lodged one month later and therefore it is

belated which is not explained by the complainant.

Under the provisions of the above mentioned act the objective of the said act is

to enforce the rights of the witnesses and victims and to protect them. Any

suspect produced under this act can be remanded only upon considering

whether there is prima facie material against him or her as per section 10 (3) of

the said act, and section 10(3) reads as follows,

If after inquiry by a court, it is found that there is prima facie material that a

person who was at relevant point of time who was on bail ..has

committed an offence under section 8 or section 9 shall be placed in

remand.

The said act under section 10 (2) provides that whatever trial that is being held

under this act needs to be taken up on a day to day basis and it should not be

postponed unless due to unavoidable circumstances. The said section reads as

a trial against a person .under section 8 or 9 shall be taken up before any

other business..and shall be held on day to day basis and not be

postponedexcept due to unavoidable circumstances.. But at the same

time under section 10(1) (a) of the act a suspect can be enlarged on bail only

upon exceptional circumstances.

The counsel appearing for the Attorney General did not aver as to how long it

would take to file indictment but according to the respondents they have been

on remand for nearly 18 months which the state counsel does not deny. Hence

there appears to be an ambiguity as to the finality of these proceedings against

the respondents which this court thinks is fit enough to consider bail for the

respondents because the act envisages a situation where according to sections

10(2) and 10 (3) the rights of the suspects charged under this act is also looked

after and there should not be an undue delay on concluding the proceedings.

Therefore the suspects in CA BA 0015-20 and suspects in CA BA 0016-20 are

hereby enlarged on bail on following conditions,

1) Rs 50000/ cash bail each,

2) Two surety bail to the value of Rs 100000/ each, 3) The suspects to report to the relevant police station on every Sunday of

the month,

Suspects not to interfere with the complainant or her family for any reason if they do and reported all bail conditions would be cancelled.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
