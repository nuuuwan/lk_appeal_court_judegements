This Appeal emanates from a judgement of the learned District Judge of Mt. LavInia dated

22.07.1996. The facts of the case before the District Court were as briefly as follows;

The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) instituted the action

bearing No.205/ZL in the District Court against the 1st and 2nd Defendant-Appellants

(hereinafter referred to as the 1st and 2nd Defendants) seeking for reliefs inter-alia, a

declaration that the Plaintiff is the Viharadhipathi of Sri Sudharmaramaya temple situated

in Kalubowila, evict the 1st and 2nd Defendants who are in forcible occupation of the

temple, restore the Plaintiff in possession therein and the damages. The Plaintiff has alleged

inter-alia, that the provisions of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance, No. 19 of 1931 (as

amended) (hereinafter referred to as the Ordinance) applies to the temple, it is a Sanghika

property, the method of succession of Viharadhipathiship of the temple is line of pupillary

(Shishshanushishaya parampanawa), according to the line of pupillary of succession the

Plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that he is the Viharadhipathi of the temple in dispute,

the 1st and 2nd Defendants are in forcible occupation of the temple since 25.06.1975. The

1st and 2nd Defendants alleged inter-alia, that the temple which is in dispute is a private

(pudgalika) property of Rev. Madawala Sunannda Thero who was the first Viharadhipathi

4

of the temple, since its a private property of Rev. Sunanda Thero, the provisions of the

Ordinance do not apply to the temple, said Rev. Sunanda Thero alienated his rights of the

property by a deed of gift bearing No. 7479 in the year 1907 (marked as 1) to his 7

pupils, thereafter those pupils entered into an agreement bearing No. 8478 in 1948 (marked

as - 4) to hold the Viharadhipathiship in rotation, accordingly, Rev. Benthara

Sumanatissa Thero who was also a party to - 4 as well as the Tutor (Nayaka Thero) of

the 1st Defendant became the Viharadhipathi of the temple in the year 1970 for a period of

6 years, on his demise, the 1st Defendant became the Viharadhipathi of the temple.

By the impugned judgment the learned District Judge has concluded that Sri

Sudharmaramaya temple is a temple property, the method of secession of

Viharadhipathiship of the temple is line of pupillary (Shishshanushishaya parampanawa),

the Plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that he is the Viharadhipathi of Sri

Sudharmaramaya and therefore, the Plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs as prayed for in the

plaint.

At the beginning of the trial following three admissions were recorded;

1. ,

2. .

3. 1907.01.19 : 7479 1948.12.16 : 8478

.

It has been admitted by both parties that the provisions of the Ordinance apply to the temple

in dispute and the first Viharadhipathi of the temple was Rev. Madawala Sunanda Thero.

Section 58 of the Evidence Ordinance reads that, No fact need be proved in any

proceeding which the parties thereto agree to admit at the hearing, or which by any

rule of pleading in force at the time they are deemed to have admitted by their pleadings

.

In the case of Mariammai vs Pethrupillai (21 NLR 200) it was decided that if a party in a

case makes an admission for whatever reason, he must stand by it; it is impossible for him

to argue a point on appeal which he formally gave up in the Court below.

5

In the case of Uvais vs Punyawathi (1993 (2) SLR 46) it was held that it is sometimes

permissible to withdraw admission of questions of law but admissions on the questions of

facts cannot be withdrawn.

In the action in hand, there is no entry in the trial proceedings to the effect that the above-

mentioned admissions were withdrawn at a later stage. In terms of section 3 of the

Ordinance, the provisions of the Ordinance apply for every temple in Sri Lanka. Therefore,

in view of admission No. 1, the Defendants are estopped from arguing that the temple in

dispute does not govern by the provisions of the Ordinance and it is not a temple property.

The learned Counsel for the Defendants submitted to this Court that admission No. 1 may

have recorded before the District Court for the reason that section 23 of the Ordinance deals

with the private property of priests. I cannot agree with that submission of the learned

Counsel for the reason that in terms of section 3 the provisions of the Ordinance apply only

to the temple property and section 23 explains as to which circumstances the private

property of a priest becomes the property of the temple and not visa verse. Under those

circumstance, the Court can conclude that the property in dispute is a temple property of

Sri Sudharmaramaya.

In terms of section 4 (2) of the Ordinance, when the management of the property belonging

to a temple is exempted from the operation of sub-section 1 of that section but not exempted

from the operation of the entire Ordinance such property should vest in the Viharadhipathi

of such temple who is referred to as the controlling Viharadhipathi (Pemananda Thero

vs Thomas Perera - 56 NLR 413). As per the interpretation in section 2 of the Ordinance,

Viharadhipathi means the principal bikkhu of the temple.

The general rule of succession of management and the title to a property of a temple is line

of pupillary (which is known as Shishshanushishaya parampanawa) from the first

incumbent of that temple. Accordingly, if the incumbency of a temple is in dispute, in the

absence of evidence to the contrary, it must be presumed that the incumbency should be

subject to the Shishshanushishaya parampanawa rule of succession (Unnanse vs. Unnanse

- (1921) 22 NLR 323, Dhammajothi vs. Sobitha - (1913) 16 NLR 408, Gunaratne Unnanse

vs. Dhammananda - (1921) 22 NLR 276, Therunnanse vs. Therunnanse - (1905) Matara

Cases 236).

6

There is no evidence in the case in hand that Rev. Madawala Sunanada Thero who was

admittedly the first Viharadhipathi of Sri Sudharmaramaya temple had appointed any

particular pupil out of the line of pupillary as his successor for the management and the

title to that temple. The uncontradicted evidence of the case is that Rev. Kodagoda

Pannasara Thero was the senior pupil of Rev. Madawala Sunanada Thero, Rev. Kodagoda

Pannananda Theros senior pupil was Rev. Kombala Medhananda Thero and his senior

pupil is Rev. Haupe Somananda Thero, who is the Plaintiff in the case. Therefore, the

Court can come to the conclusion that the succession of the Viharadhipathiship of the

temple in dispute should be according to that line of succession.

Under the above stated circumstances, I hold that the determinations of the learned District

Judge are according to the law and the facts of the case. Therefore, I affirm the impugned

judgement dated 22.07.1996 of the learned District Judge and dismiss the appeal. The

Defendant will pay Rs. 50,000/- to the Plaintiff as costs of this appeal.
