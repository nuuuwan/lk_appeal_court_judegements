Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence of him by the

learned High Court Judge of Negombo.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Negombo for two counts in

terms of section 54A(d) and 54A(b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance for having in his possession 2.4 grams of Heroin, which is a

prohibited substance under the provisions of the Ordinance and at the same

time trafficking the same.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge of Negombo by his judgment dated

29-01-2019 found the appellant guilty as charged and sentenced him to life

imprisonment on both counts.

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant

as well as the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondent Attorney

Page 3 of 13

General, invited the Court to pronounce the judgment based on the written

submissions by the parties.

In his written submissions, the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant

has urged the following four grounds of appeal for the consideration of the

Court.

(a) Break in the chain of productions being sent to the Government

Analyst

(b) Discrepancy in the identity of the productions.

(c) Dock statement was rejected based on unreasonable grounds.

(d) The trial Judge casted unnecessary burden on the accused.

Before considering the grounds of appeal in detail, I would now briefly

summarize the facts relevant to the grounds of appeal as presented to the High

Court by way of evidence.

This is an action instituted based on a raid conducted by the officers of the

Excise Department upon an information received by Excise Guard 744 Ashoka

(PW-07), from one of his personal informants about an illegal Heroin

transaction, and conveyed to PW-02, namely Excise Sgt. Major Kandawattage

Dayarathna Ranwala. The information received was of a person called

Magulpokune Michel, who is dealing in Heroin he obtains from a house

situated in Oliyamulla and that he travels to the said place early morning of

every other day, and the informant will be in a position to point out the person.

According to the evidence of PW-02, after receiving the information, the raiding

party led by Excise Inspector Sunil (PW-01) had left for Oliyamulla area of

Wattala in the early morning of 22-05-2002. After meeting the informant on

their way, the raiding party along with the informant had travelled to the bus

stand near the Oliyamulla area gravel road, and had waited there in

anticipation of the arrival of the suspect. Later, the informant had pointed out

Page 4 of 13

a person who got down from a bus at 6.45 am as Michel. Since it was informed

that he was on his way to obtain Heroin, the raiding party waited near the bus

stand until his return which happened at 8.45 am. Upon revealing his identity,

PW-02 questioned and searched the suspect to find three parcels wrapped in

blue coloured shopping bags in his trouser pocket. On search of the bags, PW-

02 had discovered 120 small packets in total with a powder like brown colour

substance packed 40 each to each of the three parcels, which the PW-02

identified as Heroin through his experience as an Excise Officer.

After arresting the suspect and temporarily sealing the productions using his

personal seal and the left thumb impression of the suspect, the productions

has been subsequently weighed in front of the suspect at the Excise office in

Colombo to discover that the substance had a total weight of 5600 milligrams.

In his evidence the witness has described the procedure he followed to reseal

the productions after the weighing.

It was his evidence that although he took the productions along with the

suspect to the Wattala Magistrate Court to be handed over to the Court, he

could not do so as the permanent Magistrate was not available. After producing

the suspect before the acting Magistrate at his house, he had to return to his

station with the productions.

PW-02 had kept the productions in his personal locker until around 8 am. the

following day, and has handed over the productions to the Officer in Charge

(OIC) of the Excise Station who was in charge of the production room as well.

Although PW-02 has not kept a note as to the time he handed over the

productions, evidence of PW-10 Rohan Wijeratne who was the OIC of the

Excise Station clearly establishes the fact that it was handed over at the time

stated by PW-02 in his evidence.

Confirming the evidence of PW-02, PW-10 has given clear evidence that the

productions were handed over to him at 8.05 am. on 23rd May 2002. After safe

keeping the productions in the safe deposit room under PW-10s care until 04-

Page 5 of 13

06-2002, the productions have been handed over by PW-10 to Excise Guard

774 Ashoka at 7.05 am. to be taken to Wattala Magistrate Court.

With the above relevant facts in mind, I now proceed to consider the grounds of

appeal urged by the learned counsel for the appellant.

(a) Break in the chain of productions being sent to the Government

Analyst:

In the written submissions the learned counsel has urged two grounds to

formulate his argument that the production chain was not proved, namely;

(1) The officer who handed over the productions to the Analyst is dead

and as such his evidence was not available.

(2) The productions were in PW-02s personal custody and he had the

free access to the productions.

The Excise Guard 774 Ashoka (PW-07 named in the indictment) was dead at

the time the case was taken up for trial. However, during the trial, on 07-11-

2017 (at page 283 of the brief) and again on 07-09-2018 (at page 308 of the

brief) the defence has specifically admitted the following facts under section

420 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

(i) The handing over of the productions by PW-10 to Excise Guard 774

Ashoka to be handed over to the Magistrate Court of Wattala and that it

was properly handed over.

(ii) The fact that from there, the productions were taken to the Government

Analyst department, and after the analysis, the same productions were

brought back to the Wattala Magistrate Court,

It is very much apparent that because of the above admissions, there had been

no necessity for the prosecution to act under section 32(2) of the Evidence

Ordinance in producing the relevant notes kept in his ordinary course of

professional duty by Excise Guard 774 Ashoka.

Page 6 of 13

It was held in Perera Vs. Attorney General (1998) 1 SLR 378 that;

An admission could be recorded at any stage of a trial, before the case for

the prosecution is closed. The purpose of recording an admission is to

dispense with the burden of proving that fact at the trial.

Therefore, I find that after admitting the chain of custody from the handing

over of the productions by PW-10 to Excise Guard Ashoka and the chain of

custody thereafter, the learned counsel for the appellant is now estopped from

arguing that the officer who handed over the productions was not available to

give evidence. I am of the view that the appellant can only challenge the chain

of possession of the productions from the taking over of the productions by

PW-02 and up to the handing over of the same by him to PW-10, as the rest of

the production chain has been admitted.

It is settled law that it was up to the prosecution to prove the uninterrupted

chain of production custody in an action of this nature.

In Perera Vs. Attorney General (Supra) it was held that;

The most important journey is the inward journey because the final

analyst report will depend on that.

In the case of Faiza Hanoon Yoosuf Vs. The Attorney General, CA Appeal

No-121/2002, HC Negombo Case No-139/93 it was stated by Ranjith Silva,

J.

There is no rule of law or practice that in a drug case the prosecution

must establish the nexus between the heroin detected and what was

produced in Court. In the ordinary cause of events the predominant or the

essential feature being the nexus of the heroin detected and the heroin that

was subjected to the analysis by the Government Analyst, the prosecution

must establish an unbroken chain of custody of the production from the

time the production was taken into custody till the time the productions

Page 7 of 13

were subjected to analysis by the Analyst. Thus, even if the production

gets destroyed after the same were subjected to analysis, the prosecution

could succeed if they could establish unbroken custody from the time of

detection up to the time of analysis by the Government Analyst.

When it comes to the argument that PW-02 had free access to the productions

as it was his personal custody, I find that the productions have been in the

personal custody of PW-02 from the moment the detection was made on 22-05-

2002 and up until the morning of 23-05-2002 where he handed over the same

to his OIC PW-10.

What is important here is whether the PW-02 had any opportunity to tamper

with the productions during the said period. It was his evidence that after

taking into his custody the brown colour substance from the possession of the

appellant, he temporarily sealed the productions by putting the same in an

envelope. PW-02 has done so by placing the left thumb impression of the

appellant and his personal seal on the sealed envelope and also by writing

down the appellant's name and word Oliyamulla. (the production marked P-

12A at the trial).

The contention of the defence is that PW-02s admitted failure to mention in his

pocket notebook that he is carrying sealing equipment with him and his not

placing the signature of the appellant on the envelope used to temporarily seal

the substance (P-12A) amounts to a failure to prove beyond reasonable doubt

the unbroken production chain.

Although PW-02 has not noted in his pocket notebook that he is carrying

sealing equipment with him, it is clear from the envelope used by PW-02 to

temporarily seal the productions until it was taken to the Excise Station for the

purpose of weighing, that in fact, he had the sealing equipment with him. The

trial Court has observed the left thumb impressions of the appellant and the

personal seal of PW-02 on the envelope marked P-12A, which was clearly a

temporary measure taken by PW-02 to ensure the safety of the productions

Page 8 of 13

until it was weighed at the Excise Station. Soon after the weighing of the

productions the same has been placed in another envelope (P-05) and all the

necessary steps have been taken to reseal in order to ensure the safety and the

identification of the productions.

After resealing the productions, PW-02 has taken immediate steps to produce

the appellant before the Magistrate and also to hand over the productions to

Court. PW-02 has clearly explained as to why he could not hand over the

productions to the Magistrate Court on the day of the raid itself, although the

appellant was produced before the Acting Magistrate at his house. Upon the

return to the Excise Station with the productions, PW-02 has placed the

productions in his personal locker and has handed over the same to his OIC

the following morning, which goes on the establish that the witness has

followed the due procedure throughout.

Hence, I am unable to agree with the argument that there was a break in the

chain of productions. I find that the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable

doubt the chain of custody of productions, and the mentioned ground of appeal

should necessarily fail.

(b) Discrepancy in the identity of productions:

As discussed earlier, I am unable to agree that not placing PW-02s and the

appellants signatures in the envelope used to temporarily seal the productions

is a discrepancy in the identity of the productions. The envelope used to

temporarily seal the productions has been produced in Court and marked as P-

12A in order to establish the procedure adopted in that regard. PW-02 has

given clear evidence as to the procedure adopted and the steps taken to reseal

the productions after the weighing of the same. I am unable to find any basis to

doubt the evidence of PW-02 in that regard and that he had any opportunity to

tamper the productions.

Page 9 of 13

When weighed at the Excise Station using equipment available at the Station,

the brown-coloured substance the PW-02 suspected to be heroin has recorded

a weight of 5.6 grams. However, when weighed by the Government Analyst

under laboratory conditions the weight of the substance had been 5.4 grams,

out of which the Government Analyst found 2.4 grams of pure heroin. It is

correct to say that the prosecution has failed to obtain an explanation

regarding the 0.2-gram difference in weight from the Government Analyst (PW-

08) when the analyst gave evidence at the trial. However, it is clear from the

evidence that what the Government Analyst weighed was what was received as

productions under proper sealing from the Wattala Magistrate Court.

I find that although the learned State Counsel who prosecuted the trial before

the High Court has sought permission of Court to re-examine the Government

Analyst in order to explain the difference in weight, it has been refused. I am of

the view the learned trial judge should have allowed the prosecution to explain

the reasons for the difference of weight as it would have served the interest of

justice for either party.

However, I am unable to find any material prejudice that has been caused to

the appellant due to this non explanation. It is common knowledge that

weighing a small quantity like the quantity weighed under normal weighing

conditions using standard weighing equipment available in a place like Excise

Office and weighing the same quantity under a laboratory environment using

highly sensitive weighing equipment can result in a difference in weight of this

kind of a small magnitude.

There can be a basis for an argument that a prejudice was caused to an

accused in a case if the weight mentioned as the weight of the productions sent

to the Government Analyst by the Court was less than the real weight obtained

by the Government Analyst under laboratory conditions and if not explained

the possible reasons for such a discrepancy.

Page 10 of 13

However, the weight obtained by the Government Analyst was 0.2 grams less

than the weight mentioned as the weight of the productions sent by the Court.

I find that if the real weight was 5.6 grams as mentioned by the Magistrate

Court, the pure heroin quantity may also be more than the analyzed 2.4 grams.

I find that the non-explanation of the small difference of weight as mentioned

before, has not caused any prejudice to the accused and hence the ground of

appeal is devoid of merit.

(c) Dock statement was rejected based on unreasonable grounds:

It is the argument of the learned Presidents Counsel that the learned High

Court judge failed to adopt the correct approach in evaluating the dock

statement of the appellant by rejecting the statement as false.

When called for a defence in a criminal case, our Courts have recognized the

right of an accused to either give evidence from the witness box and subject

himself to the test of cross examination or elect to make an unsworn statement

from the dock.

In Queen Vs. Kularatne (1968) 71 NLR 529, it was held that while jurors

must be informed that such a statement must be looked upon as evidence,

subject, however, to the infirmities that the accused statement is not made

under oath and not subject to cross examination.

Held further;

1. If the dock statement is believed it must be acted upon.

2. If it raised a reasonable doubt in their minds about the case for the

prosecution, the defence must succeed, and;

3. It must not be used against another accused.

Page 11 of 13

Although the other commonwealth jurisdictions which previously recognized

the right of an accused to make an unsworn statement from the dock has

already abolished that right, our courts still follow this legal principle which is

now embedded in our law.

However, I am of the view that although such a statement has some evidential

value subjected to the infirmities of not been made under oath and not

subjected to cross examination, such a statement needs to be considered not in

its isolation but in the context of the totality of the evidence.

It was held in the case of Don Samantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha Vs. The

Attorney General, C.A. 303/2006 decided on 11-07-2012 that;

Whether the evidence of the defence or the dock statement is sufficient

to create a doubt cannot be decided in a vacuum or in isolation because it

needs to be considered in the totality of evidence that is in the light of the

evidence for the prosecution as well as the defence.

In his dock statement, the appellant has admitted that he was arrested on the

22 of May 2002 but has denied that he had any heroin in his possession. Other

than making a general statement of denial, the appellant has failed to give any

reasonable explanation as to the evidence placed before the Court against him.

Although the learned Presidents Counsel has argued that the learned trial

judge has failed to evaluate the dock statement in its correct perspective, I find

that the learned trial judge has well evaluated the dock statement. The learned

trial judge has found that although the appellant had the opportunity to

confront the prosecution witnesses with his stand when they gave evidence, he

has failed to do so and also has failed to explain any reasons for the failure. It

appears that the learned counsel for the appellant is relying on one sentence of

the judgment to argue that the dock statement was not properly evaluated, I

am in no position to agree. The learned High Court judge has considered the

totality of the evidence as he should have, to come to the finding that the dock

Page 12 of 13

statement cannot be acted upon. For the reasons mentioned above, I find no

merit in the ground of appeal urged.

(d) The trial judge casted unnecessary burden on the accused:

I am unable to find any basis for the argument that the learned High Court

judge has casted an unnecessary burden on the accused. It is well settled law

that in a criminal trial, an accused person has no burden of proof and it is the

persecution that should prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.

It is apparent from the judgment that the learned High Court judge was

mindful of the relevant legal principles that governs a criminal trial when he

considered the evidence made available. He has considered each of the

prosecution witnesses evidence inter se and per se and also the probability

factor. He has also considered the mentioned omissions by the PW-02 in

making his notes to come to a finding whether the said omissions create a

reasonable doubt as to the prosecutions version of events. The learned trial

judge has rejected the dock statement of the appellant after considering the

evidence in its totality, which cannot be considered as casting an unnecessary

burden on the accused.

Apart from the above considered grounds of appeal, the learned Presidents

Counsel in his written submissions has drawn the attention of the Court to the

trial proceedings of 07-09-2017 (page 307 of the brief) where the learned trial

judge has decided to read over the charges from the amended indictment to the

appellant on the basis that although the amended indictment has been served

on the appellant and read over to him, it was not clear on the record.

It was the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel that if the entry dated

07-09-2017 is correct all the proceedings prior to that are void and has no

effect for any verdict.

The original indictment in this action has been filed on 28th February 2005 and

the amended indictment on 29th November 2007. I find that the trial of this

Page 13 of 13

action has commenced on 02-04-2014. After the conclusion of the evidence of

PW-02 who was the main witness of the case, the learned High Court Judge

who heard the case then has found that although the amended indictment has

been served on the accused, it has not been read to him. Accordingly, the

learned High Court judge has proceeded to read over the amended indictment

to the accused who is the appellant, for which he has pleaded not guilty.

Because of the said procedural correction, the learned High Court judge has

decided to hold the trial de novo by recalling PW-02 and proceeding therefrom.

(page 131 of the brief)

It appears that due to an inadvertent oversight the learned High Court judge

has made the contentious entry and taken steps, which has caused no

prejudice to the appellant as the amended indictment has clearly been read

over to him previously and the evidence taken afresh.

For the foregoing reasons, I find no merit in the appeal. The appeal therefore is

dismissed. The conviction and the sentence is affirmed.
