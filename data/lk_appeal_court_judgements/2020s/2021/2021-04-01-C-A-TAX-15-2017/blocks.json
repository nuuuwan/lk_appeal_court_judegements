Unless and until the language used in a statute makes the meaning entirely insensible, every word must be given its plain meaning. The court cannot undertake, out of its own notions of what is fair, to adapt or rearrange the machinery of the taxing statute. In a fiscal or a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly said for there is no room for any intendment nor for any equity nor for any presumption.
