BEFORE : N. Bandula Karunarathna, J.

COUNSEL : U.R. de Silva PC., with Savithri Fernando for

Appellants.

A.Navavi DSG. for Respondent.

ARGUED ON : 29.03.2021

DECIDED ON : 29.07.2021

R. Gurusinghe, J.

The appellants, in this case, were charged with the murder of one

Prasanna and were convicted. In addition, they were accused of hurt

punishable under Section 315 of the Penal Code and convicted. The

appellants preferred this appeal against the conviction and the sentence.

The appellants urged the following grounds of appeal.

a). The learned Trial Judge has erred in law in not taking into account

the fact that the visual identification of the appellants by PW2 and

PW3 does not satisfy Turnbull principles.

2). The learned Trial Judge has misdirected himself on the facts

transpired in the evidence of PW2.

3). The learned Trial Judge has erred in law by failing to consider the

absence of indication of the participatory presence of 3rd accused.

The learned Trial Judge has erred in law in not contemplating the

defects in the investigation, which has consequentially failed in

sustaining the conviction on the indictment.

3

In addition to the above grounds, when this appeal was taken up for

hearing, Counsel for the appellants argued that the evidence of PW3 on

the first date of his evidence contradicts the rest of his evidence. On the

first date of evidence, PW3 had stated that he could not identify the

assailants of the deceased.

The first accused is a son of PW3 Ariyadasa and a brother of PW2,

Kularatne. PW1 is the wife of PW2.

PW3 stated in his evidence that on 4th July 2008 at about 8.30 p.m.

when he was at home, he had heard a loud wailing sound of his

neighbor, Mahathun from a distance and he came to his threshold. He

also heard people running about when he flashed his torch through the

window in the front, and he had seen his son, the first accused,

assaulting somebody on the ground with a sword. The first accused

had slashed several times up and down. He had seen the second and

third accused there. Immediately, he went to his almirah and took acid

for his defence. When he came back to the window, about one or one

and half minutes later all had gone. He opened the door and looked. He

saw the deceased lying fallen on his threshold in a pool of blood.

He telephoned his daughter and told her that Mahathun was killed and

lying fallen on the threshold of his house and told her to inform the

police.

The police had come at about midnight. One of the grounds of appeal is

that the evidence of PW2 and PW3 does not satisfy Turnbull principles.

In this case, all the accused were known to PW2 and PW3. The first

accused is one of the sons of PW3. The second and third accused were

from the adjoining village. The witnesses have seen them before the

incident. PW3 had observed the incident about one and half minutes by

flashing the torch. One of the accused also flashed the torch. There

4

was a window with a broken glass panel; PW3 observed through that

space. He was very close to the scene.

PW3 described as follows:

The Court had observed that though there was a limitation, the space

was sufficient to see what had been described by PW3. PW3 has said

three, four times that . The police had recorded

the statement of PW3 on the following day. PW3 had stated to the

police as to what had happened on the same night. There was no delay

at all. The appellants argument is largely based on the evidence of PW3

given on the first date. However, PW3 had explained what had happened

to him on that day, and that learned High Court Judge had accepted

that.

In view of the above circumstances, no reasonable doubt would cast to

vitiate the conviction of the first accused.

Counsel for the appellants argued that the evidence of PW3 is

contradictory per se as he had not given evidence on the first date

incriminating the appellants.

5

However, PW3 had explained as to why he was not able to give proper

evidence on the first date of the trial on page 72 of the brief.

PW3 stated as follows:

: ?

: .

,

. .

.

The police recorded a statement of PW3 on the following day.

When leaving aside the evidence of the first date, the only contradiction

marked was regarding whether he was after dinner or not when the

incident happened. This was considered by the learned Trial Judge and

decided that it was not a material contradiction. I have no reason to

disagree with this finding. The contradiction was not with regard to vital

parts of the evidence. Whether he was after the meal or not is not

material at all for the case.

With regard to the first date of evidence as described above, PW3 had

explained what had happened to him on that day. Further, the learned

Trial Judge observed that PW3 was not a willing witness. He further

stated that a father would not readily come to give evidence against his

own son, and his behavior is natural even though he is legally bound to

tell the truth. Even on the first date of evidence, PW3 did not try to

implicate any of the accused. He only tried to help the accused.

Therefore, the suggestion that PW3 had given evidence because he had

animosity against the first accused cannot be accepted. This position

was suggested to PW3, and he had rejected that suggestion.

6

Except for the above-mentioned contradiction regarding whether he was

after dinner or not, there was no contradiction or omission. PW3 stood

by what he had stated to the police on the day of the incident. I find no

reason to disbelieve the evidence of PW3.

The evidence regarding the second and third accused was that they were

just there. The learned State Counsel who appeared at the trial had

put several leading questions to the witnesses to obtain evidence

regarding the participation of the second and third accused. However,

there was no sufficient evidence against the second and third accused.

There is evidence that they were present there. However, there is no

evidence that the second and third have had done anything, which would

clearly suggest that they had shared a common intention to kill the

deceased. The second and third accused were from the adjoining village,

and they did not have any connection or animosity with the deceased or

PW2.

The evidence of PW2 reveals that he did not clearly identify the second

and third accused. There was no evidence of a prearranged plan among

the accused.

The prosecution is under an obligation to establish that there existed

a common intention which requires a prearranged plan to convict for the

criminal act of another, the act must have been done in furtherance of

the common intention of all. It is necessary either to have direct proof of

prior concert or proof of circumstances which necessarily lead to that

inference, and the incriminating facts must be incompatible with the

innocence of the accused.

There was no sufficient evidence to infer that the second and third

accused had a common intention with the first accused to kill the

deceased or injured PW2.

7

In the circumstances, I hold that the evidence was insufficient to support

the conviction of second and third accused appellants. Therefore, the

second and third accused-appellants are acquitted of both charges.

For the reasons set out above, I hold that there is sufficient evidence

against the first accused-appellant and therefore, the conviction and the

sentence imposed on the first accused-appellant should be affirmed.

The appeal of the first accused-appellant is dismissed. The appeals of

the second and third accused appellants are allowed.
