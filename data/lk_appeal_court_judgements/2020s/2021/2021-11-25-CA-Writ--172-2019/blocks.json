Both parties agreed to get the argument disposed by way of written submissions. Anyhow none of the parties have filed the written submissions. There are several connected matters that were taken up together with this matter. The court observers that the facts relating to each are different. The Petitioner states that he is an Inspector of Police. The house and premises at G-18, Daanyagama Housing Scheme in Trincomalee, has been provided to the Petitioner upon a Lease Agreement entered into between the Petitioner and the Food Commissioner. Despite, the Petitioners failure to submit a copy of the said Lease Agreement along with his Petition, the Petitioner claims that he has complied with all the terms and conditions of the said Lease Agreement. Petitioner states that the Respondent had instituted actions against the Petitioner before the Magistrate Court of Trincomalee against the Petitioner in order to recover possession of the said premises. Nevertheless, said action has been later withdrawn by the Food Commissioner. Thereafter, the Respondent has issued the purported quit notice (P8) dated 18.02.2019 against the Petitioner demanding the Petitioner to hand over the vacant possession of the said premises alleging that the Petitioner has acted in breach of the Lease Agreement. In spite of such circumstances, the Petitioner has made this application moving for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the quit notice marked P8 stating that the purported quit notice is bad in law for the reasons mentioned below.",
