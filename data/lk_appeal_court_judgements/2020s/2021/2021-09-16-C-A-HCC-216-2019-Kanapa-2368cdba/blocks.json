According to the evidence by the main witness for the prosecution (PW1) who led the team of police officers who arrested the Appellant, on the day of the incident, a team of police officers had been on traffic duty on the Delkanda-Rattanapitya road close to the Delkanda Junction. PW1, as the OIC of the traffic branch of the Mirihana police station, had gone to Delkandain the motor cycle with another police officer at about 11.30pm. When he was on the road with the other officers doing traffic duties, he had seen a person walking from the direction of Delkanda junction towards Rattanapitiya. That person had tried to divert his direction upon seeing the police officers. He has ordered the other officers to arrest him. Upon searching the person (Appellant), they had found in his trouser pocket, two polythene bags tied together. They have suspected the contents in the polythene bags to be heroin. During the scuffle when they arrested the appellant, one police officer had got injured in his leg. Later, after taking steps to weigh the illegal substance, they had produced the appellant before the Magistrate and had taken steps to hand over the productions to the Government Analyst.",
