ARGUED ON : 27/07/2021

R. Gurusinghe, J.

Two accused-appellants were convicted for committing the murder of one Kirindi

Lakshan Cooray, an offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code

read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

The prosecution has called PW1, 11,13,14,10,4,9, and the court interpreter.

The first accused-appellant gave evidence from the witness stand. He was cross-

examined by the prosecution. The second accused-appellant made a dock

statement.

The Learned Trial Judge delivered the judgment on the 11th of July 2018,

convicting the two appellants and sentencing them to death.

The deceased was a Squash coach at SSC. He and his wife PW1 was living at

Thimbirigasyaya at the time of his death. On the 13th of January 2009, in the

evening, they came to the deceased aunts house at Lunawa. After having dinner,

PW1, the deceased, his aunt, and PW4 went to Angulana to return some notes

to a friend of PW4. They came back to the aunts house at Lunawa. The car

stopped at the gate. Aunt and her daughter PW4 went into the house. The

deceased was not able to find his slippers and asked PW1 to look for them. They

switched the seats; PW1 sat at the driving seat and bent her head to find the

slippers of the deceased. At that time, the accused-appellants came near the

door, opposite the driving seat where the deceased was seated, and shouted in

Sinhala, Ado Kavinda. The shutters were closed at that time. When PW1 heard

the noise, she looked up and saw the appellants on the motorcycle near the door,

opposite the driving seat where the deceased was seated, and the first accused-

appellant shot the deceased. PW1 ran towards the aunts house shouting,

Kavindata Vedithabuwa. The aunt and the others came immediately. The first

accused got into the driving seat of the car. The aunt and PW1 got into the rear

seat. The first accused drove the car to the Lunawa hospital in a few minutes.

After that, the deceased was transferred to the Kalubowila hospital in an

ambulance. The second accused-appellant also came to the Lunawa hospital

with a friend of the deceased.

Defense Version

Two appellants went together to attend a party at Yohans house at Angulana.

They left the party around 10.00 pm on the motorcycle, which belonged to the

second accused-appellant, as the first accused-appellant wanted to attend a

funeral.

4

The second accused-appellant rode the motorcycle along the road that leads to

Lunawa from Angulana. While they were on their way, the motorcycle fell into a

pit. At that time, the second accused-appellant asked the first accused-appellant

to keep his hand on the side pocket of the second accused-appellants trouser,

as his service weapon was inside his pocket, and to prevent it from dropping. At

that time, the first accused-appellant saw the deceaseds car parked at the

deceased aunts house gate. The deceased was one of his closest childhood

friends. He asked the second accused to see whether Kavinda was inside the car.

The second accused sounded the horn of the motorcycle. The deceased waved

his hand at them. The second accused stopped the bike near the door where the

deceased was seated, and at that time, the first accused grabbed the gun from

the trouser pocket of the second accused and showed it to the deceased. At that

moment, the gun exploded. The second accused grabbed the gun out of the first

accused hand. The first accused asked for the keys to the car from PW1, which

she gave. The first accused got into the driving seat of the car and took the

deceased to Lunawa hospital within a few minutes.

GROUNDS OF APPEAL

1. The Learned Trial Judge had failed to analyse the evidence of the

prosecution witnesses correctly and has erroneously omitted to

consider the several contradictions made by the witnesses. As a result,

this has arrived at several erroneous inferences and /or conclusions.

2. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the absence of the

common murderous intention.

3. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the story of the

prosecution as highly improbable.

4. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that at least a reasonable

doubt was created in the prosecution case by the evidence of the

5

accused-appellants and thereby has failed to award its benefit to the

appellants.

The Learned Trial Judge himself concedes the fact that there is evidence that

supports the defense version. The basis on which the Trial Judge has rejected

the defense version and accepted the prosecution version is found on page 33 of

the Judgement.

To convict the appellants, the Trial Judge has come to the following findings as

per the evidence of PW1.

1. The motorcycle rider was the first accused, and the defense version is

not compatible with that evidence.

2. If the first accused rode the motorcycle, the second accused should

have given his pistol to the first accused. If so, the inference that could

be drawn is that they have agreed to kill the deceased.

3. The pistol was loaded, but according to the evidence of the 2nd accused,

he had not kept the pistol loaded. It was not possible to fire the gun

accidentally.

The first accused gave evidence under oaths. The State Counsel extensively

cross-examined him. The first accused admitted that he took the gun out of the

trouser pocket of the second accused and tried to show it to the deceased to

perform a joke and never denied that he caused the firearm injury to the

deceased. His position was that he never intended nor wanted to kill the

deceased. The incident happened due to his foolishness.

The Trial Judge himself concedes that the subsequent conduct of the appellants

is compatible with the defense version. The incident happened at 10.00 pm. The

accused came from the opposite direction, where the car was stopped. If the

accused had come to kill the deceased, they could have fled the place quickly on

their motorcycle. PW1 stated that at that time, no other people were there. They

waited there, and the first accused himself drove the car to the nearest hospital

7

without delay. PW1 admits that there was no delay in admitting the deceased to

the Lunawa hospital.

The first accused and the second accused were at the hospital until the police

came. The pistol and the rest of the ammunition were immediately handed over

to the police by the second accused. The vehicle in which the deceased was

seated at the time of shooting was recorded as an admission under Section 420

of the Civil Criminal Procedure Court. The accused had not known that the

deceased and his wife were there at the place of the incident. They met by chance.

PW1 stated in her evidence that the only person they informed that they were

coming to the aunts house was Aunt, PW 3. The deceased and PW1 were to leave

the aunts house long before the time of the incident. The deceased and two

others went to hand over some notes to a friend of the aunts daughter. However,

they were unable to trace that friends house, and they came back without

handing over the notes. They had to go again after they had their dinner. The

accused did not know that the deceased would be at the place of the incident at

that time. The meeting occurred purely by chance.

The Learned Trial Judge believed that the rider of the motorcycle was the first

accused. PW1 stated in her evidence that both accused were on the motorcycle,

when the first accused shot the deceased. However, she later admitted that the

first accused was not on the motorcycle. She had told the police that the first

accused came near the vehicle door saying something that she could not hear

properly. After that, he shouted Ado Kavinda and shot him. PW1 also admitted

that by that time, the second accused was still on the motorcycle. It is unusual

for the rider to get down while the pillion rider was still on the motorcycle. The

rider can easily keep his feet on the ground and hands on the handle and keep

the motorcycle standing. The Pillion riders seat is generally a little higher than

the riders seat.

The first accused categorically stated that the second accused rode the

motorcycle. The Learned High Court Judge stated in the judgment that the first

8

accused was the rider and the second accused was on the rear, and the defense

did not challenge this position. However, this is not so. On page 130 of the brief,

the counsel for the defense has suggested the following:

uu fhdackd lrkjd fojk pQ; nhsisl,fha meof.k wdmq mqoa.,hd u;a Tyqg lsis oekSula inkaohla m<fjks pQ; lr isu inkaofhka Tyqf.a inkaohla kE lsh,d'

In this regard, the evidence of PW1 is not convincing because her position in the

evidence was that the first accused was still on the motorcycle when he shot the

deceased. However, when confronted with her statement made to the police, she

changed that position. She accepted that what had been recorded in her

statement was correct. As per her statement, the first accused was standing near

the car at the time of the shooting. Only the second accused was on the

motorcycle. The prosecution did not challenge the position that the second

accused drove the motorcycle. When considering this evidence, what is more

probable is that the second accused was the rider. Even the learned High Court

Judge accepted that the position of the defense is more plausible if the rider was

the second accused. The Trial Judge refused the defense version based on the

inference that he had drawn, relying on the evidence of PW1 regarding who the

motorcycle rider was.

The first accused testified under oath that he grabbed the gun from the trouser

pocket of the second accused. The prosecution did not challenge this position.

However, without any evidence, the Learned Trial Judge drew an inference that

the second accused should have given the gun to the first accused, purely on the

inference that the second accused was the pillion rider. PW1 had not seen the

first accused riding the motorcycle or seated on the riders seat. When she saw

the first accused, he was standing in front of the car door. When considering

the above evidence, the inference that the first accused rode the motorcycle is

erroneous.

9

In the case of King vs Assappu 50 NLR 324, the Court of Criminal Appeals held,

the following matters should be considered when considering common

intentions;

1. The case of each accused must be considered separately.

2. The accused must have actuated by a common intention with the doer

of the act.

The rule is that the presence alone is not sufficient to establish a common

intention. The presence must be a participatory presence.

In this case, there is no evidence to establish a pre-meditated plan between the

two accused to kill the deceased. The Learned Trial Judge inferred from the

evidence that the accused should have agreed to kill the deceased. It is not the

only inference that could be drawn from the evidence. The story of the defense is

equally possible. Where there are two or more possibilities, the appellants could

not be convicted. The accused should be given the benefit of that doubt.

If the second accused had a common intention to kill the deceased, he could

have used the pistol himself. There was no evidence that the first accused had

any experience of using a gun before. Being a sub-inspector of police, the second

accused, serving in a Special Police unit, was well trained to use weapons; there

was no reason for him to give the gun to the first accused to shoot the deceased.

The Learned High Court Judge has decided either the evidence of the first

accused or the second accused was false regarding whether the gun was loaded

when it was taken by the first accused. He says that when he pointed the gun

towards the deceased, the gun went off.

The Government analyst stated in his evidence that the particular gun does not

have a safety lock. If there is a cartridge in the gun chamber, it will fire when

10

the trigger is pulled. The only safety on this pistol is to de-cock the action using

the decocker. The Learned High Court Judge says, The question of the safety

lock does not arise if there was no cartridge in the chamber. The Government

analyst described that there are two action methods in this particular type of

gun. The gun was a semi-automatic pistol. He explained how to prepare the

gun to fire as follows:

Open the slide and put a cartridge in the chamber, or otherwise a magazine can

be put into the pistol. If there is a magazine, the slide should be pulled to

chamber a cartridge.

The Government analyst stated as follows:

This evidence shows that regardless of the method of loading the pistol, if there

is a cartridge in the chamber and if the trigger is pulled, the gun fires. In view of

this evidence, the evidence of the first accused cannot be rejected as false

evidence. At least it creates a reasonable doubt as to whether he intended to kill

the deceased. The benefit of the doubt should have been awarded to the first

accused.

There was no motive at all to kill the deceased. The deceased and the two accused

were friends, and there was no animosity between the accused and the deceased.

The accused and the deceased met clearly by chance. There was no evidence at

all to establish a pre-meditated plan between the two accused. The subsequent

conduct of the accused is compatible with the defense version. The first accused

himself took the deceased immediately to the nearest hospital. The second

accused voluntarily handed over the weapon to the police immediately. The

accused did not try to deny their involvement. At the trial, they admitted several

facts which the prosecution would have had to establish otherwise.

However, the first accused should have acted more prudently when he took the

gun from the second accused. Both accused had consumed liquor. However, the

first accused should have known that he might cause the death of his friend if

the gun went off. Even though the first accused did not intend to kill the

deceased, he should have had that knowledge.

There is no evidence to establish that the second accused had common intention

to kill the deceased. For the reasons set out above, the conviction and sentence

against the second accused is set aside. The second accused is acquitted of the

charge.

12

The conviction and the sentence for murder against the first accused is set aside.

The first accused is convicted of the charge of culpable homicide not amounting

to murder. The first accused is sentenced to a term of five years rigorous

imprisonment, which deemed to have been served from the date of the

conviction, namely 7th November 2018, and to a fine of Rs. 20000/- and in

default six months rigorous imprisonment.

Appeal allowed.
