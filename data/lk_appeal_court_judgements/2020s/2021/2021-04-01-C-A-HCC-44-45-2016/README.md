The Accused Appellants U.Christoper alias Chuti and W.H. Athula Mahinda and

another accused V. Nimal Dayaratne were indicted before the High Court of Chilaw

on the following Counts.

Code read along with section 32 of the Penal Code.

2. Committing the murder of Warnakulasooriya Reymond Feernando, an offence

punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code read along with 32 of the Penal

After trial, the 3rd accused was acquitted on all counts and the 1st and the 2nd

accused were convicted on both counts and were sentenced separately for 6 months

rigorous imprisonment for the 1st count and the death sentence was passed for the

second count. Aggrieved by the said convictions and sentences the appellants have

preferred this appeal to this court.

3

At the hearing of the appeal, it was submitted by the learned Presidents Counsel

for the appellants that the learned trial judge has failed to consider the distinction

between Section 293 (2) and Section 294 (3) of the Penal Code and that there is no

proof beyond reasonable doubt established by the prosecution that the accused had the

intention of causing injuries which in the ordinary course of nature were sufficient to

cause death.

Both Counsel were heard on their respective cases.

The background to the case briefly can be summarized as follows. The evidence of lay

witnesses PW 1, PW 2, PW 3 were led among the other official prosecution witnesses.

It transpired from the evidence of PW 1 Pradeep Fernando the son of the

deceased, that on the day of the incident around 2.30 pm, the dog owned by Muriel

Augusta one of their neighbours, had tried to attack PW 1 and he had fallen off the

bicycle. When he requested Muriel Augusta to tie up her dog and keep, she and her son

Asanga had scolded him. He had informed about the incident to his father the deceased,

who had gone to inquire about the incident around 5.30 to Muriels house. PW 1 had

heard loud noises emanating from the neighbours area and had gone to inquire about it

and had witnessed, Muriel and her second son Asanga, assaulting the deceased. Muriel

with a broom stick and the son with his hands and feet. When the witness tried to

intervene, he also had got a few blows from them. However, he has brought the father

home.

In the evening around 7.00 pm, the deceased had left home to meet Karune

(PW 3) who the deceased visits frequently and had returned home around 8.00 pm.

Thereafter, the 1st and 2nd accused had come with a crowd of people to their garden and

called out to the deceased . The 1st accused has had a

pole with him and the 2nd accused was with a sword or a knife. As it was a Poya day

with the aid of moonlight he had witnessed the father being assaulted by the 1st and 2nd

accused. All the accused are neighbours and the house of the 3rd accused was the closest

4

of the houses. After being assaulted, the father had come home and the accused have

been shouting for them not to come out that they will be killed. The father when he

came home had said that .

The deceased had complained of body pains and wanted to go to hospital. But,

the witness was unable to take the injured father to the hospital that night as the accused

were flashing their torches from the nearby houses and shouting for them not to come

out. The deceased had asked for some water around midnight and had again complained

of body pain. On the following morning around 7.00 am, the 1st accused appellant had

come in front of the house with a blood stained knife and showing as if he was licking

the knife, had again threatened that if they come out of the house they were going to

kill them. (The 1st accused is alleged to have tasted the blood that was on the knife

with his tongue.) At that moment, the wife of PW 1 had shouted that the deceased was

not responding to her and when they checked on him, he was not conscious and when

he was rushed to the hospital he was pronounced dead.

PW 2 the wife of PW 1 has corroborated the evidence of PW 1. She also testified

that the reason that they could not take her father-in-law to the hospital when he

requested was for the fear of the threats of the accused who were shouting in the area.

She also testified about the 1st accused licking the knife with his tongue. They are

neighbours and the houses are close to each other.

PW 3 Karunaratne is the person who was visited by the deceased on the night

of the incident. This witness is closely related to all the accused and a close associate of

5

the deceased. From his evidence it transpired that he was informed by the deceased he

was scared to go home as some people were waiting to attack him. He asked the

deceased to stay the night at his place, when it was declined, he had accompanied the

deceased to his home and an incident had taken place on the way. Near the house of the

mother of the 2nd accused Athula, the three accused had been waiting. Nimal the 3rd

accused had been seen with a knife. PW 3 had identified all three of them and spoken

with them and told them to sort out whatever problem in the morning. However, the

deceased had been struck by the 1st accused with a stone which hit the shoulder area of

the deceased. The witness had been able to bring the deceased home without further

incident.

According to PW 8 Dr Sisira Kumara, the cause of death is due to excessive

bleeding due to rupture of the spleen due to assault with a blunt weapon. There is only

one injury corresponding to that. No cut injuries have been detected according to the

post mortem report.

The counsel for the appellant confined his argument to the fact that the learned

judge had not considered the distinction between Knowledge against Intention and

submitted that the learned Judge should have considered lesser culpability.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General, following the best traditions of the

Attorney Generals Department has conceded that in the circumstances of the case, the

learned trial judge could have considered the position the Counsel for the appellant is

arguing on.

It has transpired in evidence that the families of the deceased and the accused

had no prior enmity and were having cordial relationships previous to the incident.

There are two incidents that had taken place on the day of the incident, where the

deceased had been assaulted. Once around 5.30 in the afternoon, thereafter, the incident

in the night where the two appellants are involved. From the medical report it can be

6

gathered that without any visible wound, due to the rupture of the spleen, the death has

been caused.

We have considered the judicial decision by Ninian Jayasuriya J in CA 64/94

decided on 11.03.1999 in Ranjith Wijesiri alias Wije Vs AG and King vs Mendis 54

NLR page 177 referred to in that case.

Considering the facts of the case and the above cited judicial decisions and the

submissions of the Counsel, we set aside the findings and convictions for the offence of

murder for the second count imposed by the learned trial judge and we find the accused

appellants guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of

intention an offence punishable under section 297 of the Penal Code. The sentence of

death imposed on the appellants are set aside.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant submitted that the accused were

22 years old when the incident took place in 1998 approximately 22 years ago and that

they do not have any previous convictions. However, it is noted that the 1st accused has

previous convictions.

This Courts considers the following facts when considering the sentence that has

to be imposed now. The families had no previous animosity and the background to the

incident is based on a request to tie up a dog who had tried to attack PW 1. The deceased

being attacked over such an incident and to come to his demise is very pathetic and

unfortunate. He had been only 45 years old according to the post mortem report.

Further, the threats by the accused had stopped the injured being taken to the hospital.

The threatening way a knife having blood appearing to being tasted in front of

witnesses, which is unbecoming of a decent human beings. These are unchallenged

evidence.

Taking in to consideration the time it has taken to conclude the case and the time

already spent by the appellants awaiting the conclusion of the Appeal, we sentence the

7

appellants separately to a term of ten years rigorous imprisonment for the second count.

The ten years rigorous imprisonment will take effect and be operative namely from the

date of conviction 17.03.2016. The conviction and sentence in regard to the 1st count

will remain unchanged. The conviction, finding and the sentence of death imposed by

the learned trial judge is set aside. The appeal is partly allowed.

The registrar is directed to send a copy of the judgment together with the original

case record to the High Court of Chilaw.
