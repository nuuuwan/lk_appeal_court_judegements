BEFORE : N. Bandula Karunarathna, J.

: R. Gurusinghe, J.

R. Gurusinghe, J.

The three Appellants with three others were indicted in the High Court of

Colombo on the following charges:

1) For being a member of an unlawful assembly, the common object was

to hurt one Prasanna Perera, an offence punishable under section 140

of the Penal Code.

2) Causing the death of Susantha Perera, an offence punishable under

section 296 read with 146 of the Penal Code.

3) Causing grievous hurt to Manel Perera, an offence punishable under

section 317 read with 146 of the Penal Code.

4) Causing grievous hurt to Cyril Perera, an offence punishable under

section 317 read with 146 of the Penal Code.

4

5) Causing grievous hurt to Stanley Jayasinghe, an offence punishable

under section 317 read with 146 of the Penal Code.

6 9 counts are alternate charges of the above under common

intention.

The Appellants are referred to by their accused numbers as in the indictment to

avoid confusion. The fourth accused died before the conclusion of the trial.

All five accused were acquitted and discharged of counts 1 5. The sixth accused

was convicted of all counts. The second, third, and fifth accused were convicted

of counts 6, 7, and 9. The first and the third accused were convicted of count 8.

The grounds of appeal relied on by the second accused-appellant are as follows:

1) The Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself in law and fact, in

acquitting a co-accused on the same charges, against whom the same

weight of evidence and by the prosecution. Thereby disregarded the

Principle of Indivisibility of the credibility of a witness.

2) The Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself in law applying the

principle of common intention and thereby holding the appellant guilty

of the said offence.

3) The prosecution failed to establish the identity of the accused beyond

reasonable doubt.

4) The Learned Trial Judge has made no genuine judicial analysis of the

contents of the dock statement and has not given cogent reasons for

5

rejecting same in his endeavor to determine whether it would creates

reasonable doubt.

5) In acquitting the accused of the one to eight charges and convicting the

accused of other charges read with Section 32 of the Penal Code the

Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself in law, giving the benefit of the

doubt prevalent in the said acquittal to the other offences thereby

causing grave prejudice to the appellants.

6) The Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself in law and fact in weighing

the case for the prosecution with that of the defense, prime-facie

rebutting the presumption of innocence.

The Grounds of appeal relied on by the third accused-appellant are as follows:

1) The Learned Trial Judge failed to give adequate attention to a strong

motive and the first witness, Manel Perera, had falsely implicated the

third accused-appellant.

2) The dying deposition said to have been made to witness Manel Perera

has been wrongly admitted against the third accused at the trial.

3) The Learned Trial Judge refused to rely upon the evidence of Manel

Perera in respect of the sixth accused but relied upon the same witness

to convict the second accused-appellant.

4) The Learned Trial Judge totally failed to pay attention to the concept of

common intention before attributing liability on the second accused-

appellant based on common intention.

5) The Learned Trial Judge has considered a statement to the police as

collaborating the evidence of identity against the third accused contrary

6

to the provision of Section 110(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

This is prejudicial to the third accused-appellant as liability is

attributed to him on the basis that he committed the offence in

furtherance of a common intention with the first accused-appellant.

6) There has been inadequate consideration of the dock statement made

by the third accused-appellant.

7) Due to one or more reasons set out above, the third accused-appellant

has been denied a fair trial.

The principal ground of the appeal of the fifth accused-appellant is that the

evidence relating to the identity of the fifth accused suffered from serious

infirmities, which render the conviction unsafe.

The appellants argue that the Learned Trial Judge acquitted the sixth accused

and convicted the others on the same evidence.

They have cited the case of Baksh vs Queen 1958 [AC 167 AC], where it was held,

Their credibility cannot be treated as divisible and accepted against one and

reject against the other. The honesty having been shown to be open to question,

it cannot be right to accept their verdict against one and re-open it in the case of

other. Their Lordships are accordingly of opinion that a new trial should have

been ordered in both cases.

The same principle has been accepted in some subsequent cases.

This argument could be sustained if the Trial Judge disbelieved the evidence of

PW1 against the sixth accused. Reasons for the acquittal of the sixth accused

are found in paragraph 76 of the judgment. The Learned Trial Judge observed

that as per the evidence of PW1, apart from the accused, there were some other

people present as well at the time of the incident. The sixth accused had not

7

positively participated in the assault on the deceased or other persons. When

considering the participation of each accused separately, the Learned Trial Judge

found that the sixth accused had not done anything to infer that he had the

common intention with the other accused to kill the deceased or hurt the other

witnesses. The Learned Trial Judge acquitted the sixth accused considering his

non-participation in the incident. As per the evidence of PW1, the sixth accused

was there. However, he had not participated in assaulting any person. Therefore,

the Learned High Court Judge observed that there was no evidence to infer that

the sixth accused had a common intention with the other accused. Thus, the

mere presence of the sixth accused was not sufficient to find him guilty of

charges. The argument that the Learned Trial Judge disbelieved the evidence of

PW1 against the sixth accused is untenable and should be rejected.

In the Case of Francis Appuhamy and Others vs The Queen 68 NLR 437, a witness

identified the first to fifth accused persons. However, the fifth accuseds name

was not mentioned in the statement to the police. The first to the fourth accused

was known to the witness for a considerable time. The fifth accused was known

to her for a relatively shorter period. The Jury returned the verdict of not guilty

regarding the fifth accused. In the appeal, the argument was that the verdict on

the first to fourth accused was unreasonable in the light of acquittal of the fifth

accused on the same evidence.

The Court of Criminal Appeal held that;

We were referred to the remarks contained in the judgment of the Privy Council

in the case of Mohamed Fiaz Baksh v. The Queen [(1958) A.C. 167.] that the

credibility (of witnesses) could not be treated as divisible and accepted against

one and rejected against anotherIn regard to the distinction the Court of

Criminal Appeal made, the Privy Council observed that "if the statements

afforded material for serious challenge to the credibility or reliability of the

witnesses on matters vital to the case for the prosecution, the defence by cross-

examination might have destroyed the whole case against both accused or, at

8

any rate, shown that the evidence of those witnesses could not be relied on as

sufficient to displace the evidence in support of the alibis. The remark that

credibility of witnesses could not be treated as divisible came to be made in the

circumstances related above. We do not think this remark can be the foundation

for a principle that the evidence of a witness must be accepted completely or not

at all.

In this case, the Learned Trial Judge did not disbelieve the evidence of PW1. He

found that there was no substantial evidence to infer the involvement of the sixth

accused at the crime scene, thus the evidence was insufficient to prove that the

sixth accused had a common intention along with the other accused. Therefore,

the argument that since the sixth accused was acquitted, all the other accused

also should have been acquitted cannot be accepted. This argument is therefore

rejected.

The next argument is that the Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself in law in

applying the principle of common intention.

In the case of the King vs Assappu (50 NLR 324), the Court of Criminal Appeal

held that;

We are of opinion that in all cases where the question of common intention

arises the Judge should tell the Jury that, in order to bring the rule in section

32 into operation, it is the duty of the prosecution to satisfy them beyond all

reasonable doubt that a criminal act has been done or committed; that such act

was done or committed by several persons; that such persons at the time the

criminal act was done or committed were acting in the furtherance of the

common intention of all; and that such intention is an ingredient of the offence

charged, or of some minor offence. The Judge should also tell the Jury that in

applying the rule of common intention there are certain vital and fundamental

principles which they must keep prominently in mind - namely (a) the case of

each prisoner must be considered separately; (b) that the Jury must be satisfied

9

beyond reasonable doubt that he was actuated by a common intention with the

doer of the criminal act at the time the alleged offence was committed; (c) they

must be told that the benefit of any reasonable doubt on this matter must be

given to the prisoner concerned - 47 N. L. R. at p. 375; (d) the Jury must be

warned to be careful not to confuse "Some or similar intention entertained

independently of each other" with "Common intention"; (e) that the inference of

common intention should never be reached unless it is a necessary inference

deducible from the circumstances of the case -A. I. R. 1945 P. C. 118; (f) the Jury

should be told that in order to justify the inference that a particular prisoner was

actuated by a common intention with the doer of the act, there must be evidence,

direct or circumstantial, either of pre-arrangement, or a pre-arranged plan, or a

declaration showing common intention, or some other significant fact at the time

of the commission of the offence, to enable them to say that a co-accused had a

common intention with the doer of the act, and not merely a same or similar

intention entertained independently of each other - 47 N. L. R. at p. 375, 48 N. L.

R. 295; (g) the Jury should also be directed that if there is no evidence of any

common intention actuating the co-accused or any particular co-accused, or if

there is any reasonable doubt on that point, then the charge cannot lie against

any one other than the actual doer of the criminal act - 44 N. L. R. 370, 46 N. L.

R. 135, 473, 475; (h) in such a case such co-accused would be liable only for

such criminal acts which they themselves committed; (i) the Jury should also be

directed that the mere fact that the co-accused were present when the doer did

the criminal act does not per se constitute common intention, unless there is

other evidence which justifies them in so holding - 45 N. L. R. 510; and (j) the

Judge should endeavour to assist the Jury by examining the case against each

of the co-accused in the light of these principles

The Learned Trial Judge has considered the acts of each accused separately.

In Paragraph 78 of the judgment, the Learned Trial Judge observes that as per

the evidence, the third accused cut the deceased with a sword, the fifth accused

10

stabbed the deceased in the head. The second accused fired a shot in the air.

Only the second, third and fifth accused were found guilty of the offence of

murder.

There were 29 injuries on the body of the deceased. Injury No. 24 was a stab

injury that pierced the heart and lungs of the deceased and was necessarily a

fatal injury. The injury No. 26, 27, 28, and 29 were grievous injuries. The Learned

Trial Judge observed that these injuries were caused to kill the deceased, and

therefore the second, third and fifth accused had the common intention to kill

the deceased. This finding is not an inference based on circumstantial evidence

but on actual participation to achieve the object of killing the deceased. These

incriminating facts are incompatible with the innocence of the accused. The

active participation of the second, third, and fifth accused shows a common

intention among them to kill the deceased. In the circumstances, the conclusions

arrived at by the Trial Judge cannot be faulted.

The argument that a dying deposition was wrongly admitted has no merit. The

conviction was not based on a dying deposition. The Learned Trial Judge

considered the evidence regarding the incident, which resulted in the killing of

the deceased and injuring the others. Each accused was convicted for the

offenses where the accused had actively participated in achieving the result.

There were three incidents on that fateful day. The first incident was at a betting

center that PW1 did not see. The second incident was that the second and fifth

accused came to the deceaseds house and assaulted the deceased, which PW1

and PW6 saw. The third incident occurred at about 7.00 p.m., killing the

deceased and injuring PW1, PW2 and PW3. No dying deposition was admitted in

the evidence. After the second incident, the deceased stated to his mother the

names of the second and fifth accused. This can not be treated as a dying

deposition. The argument that some accused were identified only in the dock

would be considered later. In the circumstances, the contention that a dying

deposition was wrongly admitted is rejected.

11

On behalf of the third accused, it was argued that the deceased family members

had a strong motive to implicate the third accused. The Learned Trial Judge

considered whether the third accused was falsely implicated for a previous

animosity between PW1 and the third accused. PW1 stated in her evidence that

she was involved in dealing with illicit liquor. It was suggested to PW1 at the trial

that the third accused had given information to the police regarding her illicit

liquor, and therefore, there is a strong motive to implicate the third accused.

PW1 rejected this suggestion and said that the third accused gave information

to the police only after her sons death. She admitted that she had been fined

for illicit liquor cases.

The Learned Trial Judge has considered this argument and concluded that there

was no connection between the illicit liquor cases and the murder. PW1 herself

was grievously injured in the incident. PW2 also was injured. Both of them gave

evidence in the trial. As per the evidence of PW2, when he came to see what was

happening, the third accused assaulted him. His hand was severely injured, and

he went inside the house. PW3 did not state anything regarding the other

accused. He did not say that he had seen the third accused assaulting their son.

If PW2 wanted to implicate any of the accused falsely, he could have done so as

he was present when the incident happened.

On behalf of the third accused, the only suggestion made to PW2 was that he

was telling lies regarding his injury. There was no suggestion to PW 2 that he

was giving evidence against the third accused because of the previous animosity

PW3 had given evidence at the Magistrate Court, and that evidence was

adopted under section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance where PW3 had stated

that;

f;=kafjks ;a;slre lshdf.k .shd Th bkafka frdahsf. udud' lj;a

lmkak lsj' uu ;=kafjks ;a;slre fyd|g ud okakj'

12

PW1 and PW2 gave evidence. PW1 and PW2 were assaulted by the third accused.

The son of PW1 was killed. The house was damaged. The witnesses had not

implicated the third accused in any other previous or subsequent offence. What

happened to the deceased and PW1, PW2 and PW3 were not made-up events.

The incidents actually occurred. The Learned Trial Judge concluded that there

was no reason to reject the evidence of PW1 and PW2. This court has no reason

to disagree with this finding.

The next ground of appeal is that the identity of the accused was not established

beyond a reasonable doubt. The third accused was living in the immediate

neighborhood; there was no issue regarding his identity.

The argument is that the fifth accused was a total stranger to PW1 before the

incident. PW1 stated that on the date of the incident, the second and fifth

accused came to her house and asked her whether Roy (deceased) was at home.

PW1 answered in the negative. However, when they were about to leave, the

deceased came to the road from somewhere. There was an altercation between

the deceased and the second and fifth accused. The second and fifth accused hit

the deceased. When the second accused was about to get on to his cycle, a pistol

dropped, and then the second accused took it and got onto the cycle. PW1, in

her evidence, said that her deceased son introduced the second accused as

Pradeep and the fifth accused as Chutie Malli. The complaint is that this

introduction cannot be considered reliable, and therefore, the identity of the

second and fifth accused was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The

Learned Trial Judge accepted this evidence. By the time the third incident

happened in which the deceased was killed, PW1 knew the second and fifth

accused as Pradeep and Chutie Malli. PW6, in his evidence, stated that on the

evening of the date of the incident at about 6.00 p.m., Pradeep, the second

accused, and Chutie Malli, the fifth accused, had an altercation with the

deceased on the road. After that, the second and fifth accused went away on

13

their cycles. This witness referred to the second and fifth accused as Pradeep

and Chutie Malli.

There was no suggestion to PW6 that the second and fifth accused were not

known to him before the incident. No contradiction or omission was marked

during the cross-examination. PW6 stated that the second accused and third

accused were from their village. He knew them from their childhood. The fifth

accused was also known to him for about ten years before the incident. He said

he did not know the fifth accuseds real name, but he was known as Chutie Malli.

This evidence was not shaken during the cross-examination.

Furthermore, PW6 did not say that he saw the third incident though he was only

a little distance from the place of the incident. He said he heard the noise of a

gunshot and shouting. He rushed to the place of the incident. When considering

the evidence of PW6 and the evidence of PW1, there was no doubt that the second

and fifth accused came to the deceaseds house in the second incident. Therefore,

PW1 knew the second and the fifth accused as Pradeep and Chutie Malli at the

third incident. Counsel for the fifth accused submitted that the fifth accused was

not referred to as Chutie Malli. However, almost all the witnesses referred to him

as Chutie Malli.

Furthermore, the Fifth accused in his dock statement stated this;

uf.a ku iqo;a l=udr f.org pQ mq;d lsh, lshkj.

In view of the aforementioned evidence, we hold that the second and fifth

accuseds identities were established beyond reasonable doubt.

The evidence of the two witnesses called by the third accused revealed nothing

helpful to this case. The Learned Trial Judge considered that evidence. The

Learned Trial Judge considered all dock statements made by the accused. The

second and fifth accused made a very short statement denying their involvement.

14

The third accused stated that he came home around 5.30 to 6.00 p.m. on the

day of the incident. Few three-wheelers came and stopped before his house.

Then some people went towards the deceaseds house. After about fifteen

minutes, they came back and went away in the same three-wheelers. There was

animosity between him and the deceaseds family because he was a police

informant about the illicit liquor of the deceased family.

The Learned Trial Judge considered the dock statement. The Judge stated in his

judgment that if he could believe the dock statements, the accused should be

acquitted, and if it creates reasonable doubt, still he would acquit the accused.

Paragraphs 67, 68, 69, 70,71, 72, 73, 74, and 75 are devoted to considering the

dock statements made by the accused. The Learned Trial Judge adequately dealt

with and addressed the evidential value and came to a conclusion. Therefore, the

complaint that the Learned Trial Judge had not analysed and not given reasons

to reject the dock statements cannot be accepted.

The following argument concerns the contradiction marked as 2V 1 in paragraph

19 of the judgment, the Learned Trial Judge stated that this contradiction further

proves the second accuseds identity. This is a misdirection and contrary to the

provisions of section 110-3 of the Criminal Procedure Code. However, as

discussed above, the identities of the accused were established beyond

reasonable doubt by other evidence, and misdirection on the part of the Trial

Judge had not caused prejudice to the accused. As such, by applying the

provision of Article 138 of the Constitution and section 334 of the Criminal

Procedure Code, this argument is rejected.

On behalf of the third accused, it was submitted that as he was well known to

the witnesses, he would not have gone to the scene, and the learned Trial Judge

did not consider that fact. PW1 gave evidence that the third accused attacked

the deceased with a sword and also attacked PW2 with a sword. PW2 stated that

his hand was cut by the third accused. PW3 had given evidence and stated that

15

the third accused asked other accused to cut PW3. Therefore, this argument

cannot be accepted.

For these reasons, the appeals of the accused-appellants are dismissed.
