MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioners in this application have invoked the supervisory

jurisdiction of this Court under Article 140 of the Constitution

seeking the discretionary remedy of writ of mandamus.

When this matter was taken up for argument, both parties had

consented to dispose the application by way of written submissions

that have already been tendered.

The 1st Petitioner and the 2nd Petitioners husband R.G. Sirisena were

the owners of the property called Rajawatte, approximately one Acre

in extend in the town of Mawathagama depicted in Plan No. 480 as

Lot 1 which was acquired by the State in terms of the Land

Acquisition Act, No. 09 of 1950 (sometimes referred to as the Act) for

a public purpose on or about 1986.

It is an undisputed fact that the 1st Petitioner held title to 3/4 share

of the said land whilst the 2nd Petitioners husband R.G. Sirisena held

title to the balance 1/4 share.

Pg. 3 of 8

At the section 9 inquiry which was held to determine the

compensation payable, the 1st Petitioner and the said R.G. Sirisena

had submitted their title documents for the entitlement on their

respective shares of the said land. Accordingly, the section 10(1)(a)-

Notice and the section 17 award have been published upon the above

information received by the State.

The Petitioners state that although the said property acquired in

1986, up to 2002 no compensation was paid. Therefore, the 1st

Petitioner complained to the Public Petitions Committee of Parliament

for the payment of compensation and for the divesture of the

unutilized land and accordingly, the committee gave a

recommendation, recommending the divesture of a portion of land

which was unutilised and for the payment of compensation for the

balance. These facts are reflected in the document marked P12.

Consequently, the portion of the land which is unutilised was

divested by Gazette, No. 1486/17 dated 28.02.2007. This document

has been marked as P15 by the Petitioners.

It was revealed to this Court that the Petitioners later requested for

alternative land instead of compensation and upon such request, a

portion of land called Deverwatte was demarcated for transfer. In the

meantime, the Mawathagama Pradeshiya Sabha instituted an action

challenging, inter alia, the said divesture by way of Writ Application in

case bearing No. Writ/285/2008 before this Court.

In the said application, on 30.08.2013 this Court gave a judgment

against the Petitioners who were cited, inter alia, as 5th and 6th

Respondents by quashing the order for divesture.

It was in those circumstances, the 1st Petitioner made a request to

the 3rd Respondent, Minister of Land and Land Development that the

extend of land to be transferred in lieu of compensation be increased

accordingly taking into consideration that the Petitioners did not

Pg. 4 of 8

benefit from the said divesting order as the same was quashed by this

Court (vide document marked P22). Accordingly, the 3rd Respondent

issuing a letter marked P23, has instructed the 1st Respondent, the

Divisional Secretary, Mawathagama to take necessary steps to

transfer an alternative land (in lieu of compensation) to the

Petitioners.

The Petitioners further submit that although the 1st Respondent is

legally bound to comply with the directions made by the 3rd

Respondent, he failed to do so. Therefore, the Petitioners argue that

the failure of the 1st Respondent to transfer an alternative portion of

land in lieu of compensation to the 1st Petitioner and the heirs of R.G.

Sirisena is unreasonable, arbitrary, malicious, illegal, and ultra vires

the provisions of section 36 of the Land Acquisition Act.

The Petitioner sought, inter alia, the following relief:

b. Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus to compel the 1st Respondent to transfer an alternative land being the property of the state to the 1st Petitioner and the heirs of R.G. Sirisena in lieu of compensation for the acquisition of the land called Rajawatte, as reflected in P23. In the alternative to (b) above, c. Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus to compel the 1st Respondent to act in terms of the provisions of section 36 of the Land Acquisition Act to transfer an alternative land being the property of the state to the 1st Petitioner and the heirs of R.G. Sirisena in lieu of compensation for the acquisition of the land called Rajawatte, as reflected in P23.

The learned State Counsel for the Respondents admitted the fact that

the Petitioners still had not been given an alternative land for the

portion of land that had been utilized and therefore, they have had

neither compensation nor alternative land.

Pg. 5 of 8

The learned State Counsel also submitted that in addition to the

claims made by the 1st Petitioner and the deceased R.G. Sirisena, the

Mahanuwara Sri Vishnu Devalaya has sent a letter dated 05.12.2007

to the 1st Respondent making a claim for the acquired land (vide

1R2). Therefore, she further submitted that since title to the land was

unclear, a legal advice was sought, and the Petitioners claim was not

proceeded with.

However, this Court is of the view that according to the Land

Acquisition Act, all claims to an acquired land must be submitted to

the relevant Acquiring Officer1 at the time of the inquiry i.e., inquiry

into claims for compensation (vide section 9). Therefore, in the

instant case, it reveals that the Mahanuwera Sri Vishnu Devalaya

neither did not participate in the inquiry nor submitted any such

claim before issuing section 17 notice and therefore any claim, they

may have, has to be canvassed before the appropriate District Court.

The learned State Counsel upholding the highest traditions of the

Attorney Generals Department, also informed the above legal position

in her written submissions.

Therefore, we hold that the above claim of the Mahanuwara Sri

Vishnu Devalaya to the acquired land cannot be entertained at this

stage.

The learned State Counsel for the Respondents referring to a

comment made by this Court in the aforesaid case namely,

CA/Writ/285/2008 submitted that entitlement of the 1st Petitioner

and the R.G. Sirisena (who have been cited as 5th and 6th

Respondents respectively) to the said land has been questioned by

the Court.

1 According to section 65 of the Land Acquisition Act, acquiring officer", with reference to any land, means the Government Agent or Assistant Government Agent of the administrative district in which that land is situated, or any other prescribed officer.

Pg. 6 of 8

In reference to the Affidavit filed by the 5th Respondent who is the 1st

Petitioner in the instant application, the above judgment holds that,

This court observes that other than a mere bare statement the 5th Respondent's land was acquired in 1986 there is no other statement or material by way of documentary proof that is placed before this court to prove his title or entitlement to the property in question at any point of time. Nor any submissions made to this court as to whether 5th Respondent has any interest/right to the property in question. This court is of the view that both 5th & 6th Respondents are 'schemers' who very craftily made use of the State machinery and misled persons in authority only for their personal gains... [per Anil Gooneratne, J., at pg. 10].

However, this Court is of the view that the aforesaid comments are

respectfully obiter since the said case (CA/Writ/285/2008) was an

application to quash the divesture and not the payment of

compensation to the Petitioners. Further, it is important to note that

the findings of the section 9 inquiry or the section 17 award was not

challenged in the case. In any event, the above observation or

comment is not a judgment or pronouncement on the Petitioners

entitlement to the land.

Furthermore, this Court observes that after concluding all the

necessary procedural steps including the section 9 inquiry and the

section 17 Notice (P7), the Petitioners have jointly entitled to the

proposed compensation. Thus, the Respondents now cannot be

permitted to take up a different position or cannot be permitted to

question the above procedures. A party to a judicial proceeding

cannot take up inconsistent positions to suit the occasion. A party

cannot blow hot and cold, affirm, and disaffirm and approbate and

reprobate simultaneously. Quod approbo non reprobo - One cannot

take the benefit of an instrument, and at the same time repudiate it

(vide Ceylon Plywoods Corporation vs. Samastha Lanka G.N.S.M Rajya

Sanstha Sevaka Sangamaya2).

This Court observed that after the judgment in CA/Writ 285/2008 in

which the aforesaid divesting order P15 quashed, the 1st Petitioner

made a request to the 3rd Respondent, the Minister of Land and Land

Development that the extent of land to be transferred in lieu of

compensation (which was pending in respect of the portion of land on

which the Public Library was constructed and therefore could not be

divested) be increased, taking into consideration that the Petitioners

did not benefit from the said divesting order as the same was

quashed by this Court. Accordingly, the 3rd Respondent approved the

said request of the Petitioner and subsequently the 2nd Respondent

instructed the 1st Respondent (vide P23) to take necessary steps to

transfer an alternative land (in lieu of compensation) to the

Petitioners.

However, being the competent officer i.e., Acquiring Officer, the 1st

Respondent has failed to take necessary steps to transfer an

alternative portion of land in lieu of compensation to the 1st Petitioner

and the heirs of R.G. Sirisena. According to my view, this inaction is,

to say the least, unreasonable according to the standard of

unreasonableness would amount to an abuse of administrative

authority set out in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. vs.

Wednesbury Corporation3.

Further, the instant application presents peculiar facts and

circumstances which warrant interference by this Court to rectify an

apparent injustice - acquisition proceedings having commenced as far

back as 1986 and the owners are denied due compensation or

alternative land for the last 35 years. As the Chief Justice Marshall

(then he was) emphasized in Marbury vs. Madison4, it is a general

and indisputable rule that where there is a legal right, there is also a

legal remedy by suit or action at law whenever that right is invaded.

Every right, when withheld, must have a remedy, and every injury its

proper redress5.

In the circumstances, we make order allowing this application as per

sub paragraph (b) of the prayer to the Petition. Accordingly, writ of

mandamus issued as per the prayer to the Petition without costs.

Application allowed. No Costs.
