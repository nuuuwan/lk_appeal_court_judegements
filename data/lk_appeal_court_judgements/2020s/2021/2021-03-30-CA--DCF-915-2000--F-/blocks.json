In addition the Defendant-Appellants had marked in evidence and proved several documents such as voters registers, receipts relating to payment of rates, to establish the fact that they were in occupation of the said land for a long period of time. On the other hand, this documentary evidence contradicts the position taken up on behalf of the plaintiff and supports the claim made by the Defendant-Appellants that they have acquired prescriptive title to the said land.",
