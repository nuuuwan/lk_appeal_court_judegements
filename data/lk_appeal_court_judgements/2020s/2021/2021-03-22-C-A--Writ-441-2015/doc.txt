A.H.M.D. Nawaz, I.

16.01.2019

By a Petition dated 09.11.2015, the Petitioner seeks to quash the determinations made by

the Commissioner of Land Settlement (CTS) under Section 14 of the Registration of

Title Act, No. 21 of 1998 (the Act). The aforesaid Act contains a comprehensive scheme

to effect registration of title with relevant provisions that empower the registration of

title subsequent to a cadastral survey. The material scheme, in my view, all begins with

Section 11 of the Act. In terms of Section 11 of the said Act, the Commissioner of Title

Settlement (CTS) shall request the Surveyor General to prepare cadastral maps for the

areas specified in the Minister's order which is made under Section 1 and upon such

request the Surveyor General shall cause such cadastral maps to be prepared and

certified copies thereof to be issued to Commissioner of Title Settlement (CTS). In terms

of Section 12 of the said Act, the Commissioner of Title Settlement shall, on receipt of

such certified copies of cadastral maps publish a notice in the gazette, calling for any

claimant to the land parcel speCified in such notice to submit his claim within the

prescribed time from the date of publication of such notice. Subsequent to receipt of

claims the Commissioner of Title Settlement shall cause an investigation to be conducted

in order to determine the genuineness or otherwise of the claims made in response to the

notice under Section 12 ' see Section 13 of the Act. It is upon the conclusion of the

investigation mandated by Section 13 that the Commissioner of Title Settlement shall

publish in the gazette the determination thereon ' (the order of Declaration ' Section 14).

The Petitioner in this case seeks to have determinations made under Section 14 quashed

and it has to be noted that these determinations have been published in gazettes which

have been appended to this petition as P26 to P30. The Determinations have been

published as far back as 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015 in gazettes bearing Nos. 1705/14, 1854/25,

1841/31,1796/24 and 1913/25.

The petitioner alleges that these determinations had been published for issuance of

certificates of title in favour of the 8th, 10th and 11 th Respondents to this case. But there is

nothing in the petition disclosed to demonstrate that the Petitioner or his legitimate

rights have been prejudiced by the issuance of these certificates in respect of the

aforesaid Respondents.

Any party seeking to obtain relief by way of certiorari has to satisfy the Atkininan formula

postulated in Rex vs. Eectricity Commissioners (1924) 1 KB 171 where the prejudice to

one's right was predicated as a condition precedent to the issuance of writ of certiorari.

"Whenever any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions affecting the rights

of subjects, and having the duty to act judicially, act in excess of their legal authority .... "

In the circumstances this application for certiorari to quash the declarations published

under Section 14 has to fail.

There is a far more difficult hurdle that the Petitioner has to overcome.

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General points out that Section 22 of the Registration

of Title Act, No.21 of 1998 provides an alternative and adequate remedy to the Petitioner.

In terms of this section if the claimant or the Petitioner is indeed aggrieved by the order

of declaration made by Commissioner General of Title Settlement under Section 14 of the

Registration of Title Act, No.21 of 1998, it is open to him to prefer an appeal against such

declaration within the prescribed period to the District Court having jurisdiction for the

area where land parcel is situated.

There is a catena of cases that bar discretionary remedy such as a writ of certiorari when

is an efficacious and alternative remedy provided for in a statue-see Dedigama v

Preventive Offlcer, Sri Lanka Customs and Others (2004) SrLLR 37.

Even on this ground the application for certiorari must fail. The petitioner no doubt

makes reference to a pending partition action that has been instituted in the District

Court of Moratuwa in respect of this land and it is not clear upon a perusal of the pleadings

filed in this case whether the land which the Petitioner has sought to partition in the

5

District Court of Moratuwa has been impacted upon by any of the title certificates that

have been issued in this case. This Court took pains to identify the land belonging to the

Petitioner in any of the determinations given by the 1st Respondent and it was unable to

do so.

In any event this raises disputed questions of fact which could be effectively adjudicated

upon only in the District Court which the Petitioner enjoys by virtue of section 22 of the

Act.

In these circumstances, this Court takes the view there is no prima facie case of an act or

decision that has been made out to be ultra vires and this Court proceeds to dismiss this

application for certiorari.
