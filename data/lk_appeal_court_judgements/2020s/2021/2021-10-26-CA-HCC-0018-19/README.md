Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) filed this appeal

on being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence of him by the learned High

Court judge of Tangalle.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court for committing the offence of

murder of one Sisilihmy Amarakoon, punishable under section 296 of the

Penal Code.

After trial, the appellant was found guilty as charged, by the judgment dated

07-01-2019 of the learned High Court judge of Tangalle and was sentenced to

death accordingly.

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned counsel for the appellant urged the

following three grounds of appeal for the consideration of this Court.

Page 3 of 12

(1) The learned trial judge has failed to address her mind to the material

inconsistencies and infirmities in the evidence adduced by the two

alleged eye witnesses namely, PW-02 Kanthi Samarasekara and PW-03

Puspika Samarasekara and thereby have failed to consider that the

reasonable doubt generated thereby should accrue to the advantage of

the accused appellant.

(2) The learned trial judge has failed to consider the serious infirmities in

the evidence of PW-02- Kanthi Samarasekara and PW-03 Pushpika

Samarasekara with regard to the accused appellant carrying a knife and

thereby has failed to consider that the evidence adduced by the said

witnesses are highly improbable.

(3) The learned trial judge failed to take into consideration the absence of

motive on the part the accused appellant to cause the death of the

deceased and thereby has failed to consider that the circumstances of

the case suggest involvement of a third party in the incident.

Before considering the grounds of appeal in detail, I would now briefly

summarize the facts that led to the death of the deceased as borne out by

evidence led in the action.

This is an incident that took place on the 28th of May 1997 at a place called

Keselwatta in Katuwana Police area. PW-02 Kanthi Samarasekara the daughter

of the deceased operated a small boutique in front of her house which was

adjacent to Keselwatte-Udagomadiya road and her mother the deceased used to

help her to run the boutique when necessary. According to the evidence of PW-

02, her mother who came to the boutique at about 3.30 pm on the day of the

incident was sitting on the half wall of the veranda when she saw the appellant

who was also a relative, whom she identified as coming from the

direction of Udagomadiya. She has also seen her brothers daughter coming

towards the boutique.

Page 4 of 12

The appellant who came into the open veranda of the boutique, began

assaulting the deceased using his fists, which resulted in her falling off the half

wall where she was seated. The witness has intervened and helped her mother

to stand. She has also seen the appellant in possession of a knife. Thereafter,

the appellant who was in front of the boutique has started scolding them in

foul language for making a Police complaint against the brother of the

appellant about an illegal felling of timber. While doing so, he has again

attacked the deceased using a wooden club which he picked from the ground.

When the witness attempted to intervene, the appellant has started dragging

her away, holding her hair by one hand and holding the knife by the other.

This resulted in the deceased intervening by holding onto the appellant in order

to rescue her daughter from the clutches of the appellant. While this was

happening, the witness has seen the deceased falling onto the ground with a

knife planted deep into her head. The appellant thereafter has run away from

the scene. After informing the Police of the incident, the deceased has been

admitted to the hospital where she succumbed to her injuries.

The evidence also reveals that the husband of PW-02 who runs a carpentry

shed near the house was at home at the time of the incident and a boy who

worked with him who has seen the incident had informed him what was

happening. However, it appears that he has not intervened or even come out of

the house, even though the incident has been going on for about ten to fifteen

minutes. Although the learned counsel who appeared for the appellant in the

High Court has made an attempt to portray that it was the husband of PW-02

who came with a knife, I am unable to find any basis for such involvement of

him in the incident.

The above-mentioned boy, Madura Susantha who has given evidence at the

trial has confirmed that the husband of PW-02 had no involvement in the

incident.

Page 5 of 12

PW-03 Pushpika Samarasekara was the brothers daughter mentioned by PW-

02 in her evidence. According to her, she was in the habit of helping her

grandmother at the boutique owned by her aunt. On the day of the incident,

she has met her aunt while coming towards the boutique and has also seen the

appellant whom she identified as with a knife in his waist. Her evidence

was that the appellant came and attacked while dragging PW-02 by holding her

from her hair. According to her, it was then the grandmother attempted to

rescue PW-02 from the appellant and was assaulted by him using a club.

Thereafter, she has seen her grandmother being stabbed by the appellant in

the back of her chest. She had seen that even with the injury, the deceased

attempting to rescue PW-02 by clinging on to the appellant and being stabbed

in the head for the second time. Her evidence also confirms the fact that a

person called Thilak had attempted to stop the quarrel between the parties.

The evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) clearly establishes the fatal

nature of the stab injury suffered by the deceased to her head which has

penetrated 95 mm. deep into the head. (Injury 01). The JMO has observed

another cut injury on the back of the chest (Injury 02), as well as a scab and

an abrasion on the abdomen area and on the knees of the deceased

respectively. (Injury 03 and 04).

He has opined that the cut injury No 01 and 02 can be caused by using the

Knife marked P-02 and injury No 04 by the wooden club marked P-01, which

confirms the evidence of PW-02 and PW-03 who has identified the knife and

the wooden pole as the weapons used when they gave evidence. He has also

categorically excluded the possibility of injury No 01, namely, the deep stab

wound to the head, happening unintentionally in a sudden fight. However, has

expressed the opinion that injury No 04 could also be a result of a fall.

When called for a defence at the conclusion of the prosecution case, the

appellant has made a statement from the dock and has called the earlier

mentioned Thilak as a witness. In his dock statement, he has stated that while

Page 6 of 12

passing an abandoned boutique in the evening, he was attacked by four

persons, including witnesses 02 and 03, an old woman and one Darmadasa. It

was his stand that in order to escape from them, he removed his clothes and

ran away from the scene and he is unaware of anything else.

The earlier mentioned Thilak, who is supposed to have attempted to settle the

dispute states in his evidence that when he came to the scene of the incident,

both sides were quarrelling and attacking each other using stone, but could

not stop the fight and he left the place as a result. His evidence also reveals

that all the parties to the dispute are well known to each other as they are

closely related.

With the above facts in mind, I will now proceed to consider the grounds of

appeal urged by the learned counsel for the appellant in detail.

First and Second Grounds of Appeal: -

As both the above grounds are based on the premise that the learned trial

judge failed to consider the inconsistencies, infirmities and the probabilities of

the evidence of PW-02 and PW-03, both grounds will be considered together.

The learned counsel brought to the attention of the Court several pieces of the

evidence of the two witnesses which he claims inconsistent and contradictory.

However, I am in no position to agree with the contention of the learned

counsel. One has to bear in mind that this was an incident that has taken

place in the year 1997. PW-02 has commenced her evidence on 11-03-2013

and PW-03 on 19-03-2014, some sixteen years after the actual event. PW-03

has been a young school girl at the time.

It is settled law that a witness who gives evidence long after the incident is not

expected to have a photographic memory as to the sequence of events that took

place within a short span of time like in the given incident.

Page 7 of 12

At this stage it is appropriate to refer to the Indian case of Bhoginbhai

Hitijibhai Vs State of Gujarat (AIR 1983-SC 753 at pp 756-758) very often

cited in our courts. It was held:

1) By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video

tape is replayed on the mental screen.

2) Ordinarily, so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The

witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an

element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to

be attuned to absorb the details.

3) The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one may

notice, and the other may not. An object or movement might emboss its

image on one persons mind, whereas it might go unnoticed on the part

another.

4) By and large people cannot accurately recall a conversation and

reproduce the very words used by them or heard by them. They can

only recall the main purpose of the conversation. It is unrealistic to

expect a witness to be a human tape recorder.

5) In regard to exact time of an incident, or the time duration of an

occurrence, usually people make their estimates by guesswork on the

spur of the moment at the time of interrogation. And one cannot expect

people to make very precise or reliable estimates of such matters. Again,

it depends on the time-sense of individuals which varies from person to

person.

6) Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the

sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short

time span. A witness is liable to get confused or mixed up when

interrogated later on.

Page 8 of 12

7) A witness, though wholly truthful, is liable to be overawed by the court

atmosphere and the piercing cross-examination made by counsel and

out of nervousness mix up facts, get confused regarding sequence of

events, or fill up details from imagination on the spur of the moment. The

sub-conscious mind of the witness sometime so operates on account of

the fear of looking foolish or being disbelieved though the witnesses is

giving truthful and honest account of the occurrence witnessed by him

perhaps it is a sort of a psychological defense mechanism activated on

the spur of the moment.

I am of the view that the mentioned inconsistencies and infirmities of the

two witnesses, namely, PW-02 and PW-03 are too trivial in nature to be

considered as relevant. Although there is an omission in the evidence of PW-

03 as to who was assaulted first by the appellant, her evidence has been

consistent as to the events that took place thereafter. Even as to the fact

whether the appellant was holding the knife or whether he had it in his

waist when the initial assault took place cannot be considered material

omissions. When taken as a whole, it is obvious that she has forgotten some

of the events that took place on that fateful day due to the passage of time.

The evidence clearly shows that when PW-02 was dragged by the appellant

by holding her from her hair, she had no way of looking up as she was

facing downwards due to the grip of the appellant. That may be the very

reason why she did not speak about the first stabbing on to the back of her

mother and even the stabbing to the head. It was the PW-03 who was

observing from a little distance away who has clearly seen the stabbing,

which is highly probable, given the circumstances of the incident. I am

unable to agree with the contention that the evidence as to how the stabbing

took place was improbable as it has no basis. I find that the testimonial

trustworthiness of the evidence of the witnesses have not been dented in

Page 9 of 12

any manner due to the mentioned omissions as it does not go to the root of

the matter.

Although it was contended that the learned trial judge has failed to give due

consideration to the evidence of the witness called on behalf of the

appellant, I find it was not so. The learned High Court judge has well

considered the evidence of Thilak who has come to the place of the incident

after it commenced, it appears that he has seen it as a quarrel between the

parties due to that fact. I find that in fact his evidence was also in line with

the evidence of the prosecution as to the material facts.

For the reasons considered above, I find no merit in the grounds of appeal

urged.

Third Ground of Appeal: -

It was contended that there was no basis to suggest that the appellant had

any intention to kill, or motive for that matter. Again, it is well settled law

that it is not always necessary for the prosecution to prove the motive.

In the case of The Attorney General Vs. Potta Naufer and others (2007) 2

SLR 144 at page 184, it was held:

Motive has been defined as that which moves or influence the mind. An

action without a motive has been considered to be an effect without a

cause. It has been defined in Gangaram Vs. Emperor 62 IC 545, as

something so operating upon the mind as to induce or to tend towards

inducing a particular act or course of conduct.

With respect to the relevance of motive to a criminal case, it has been

stated with clarity that the existence of a motive is not a wholly essential

ingredient in the prosecution case. There is no requirement therefore for the

prosecution to prove a motive in order to prove a charge. The motive which

induces a man to do a particular act is known to him and him alone.

Page 10 of 12

Therefore, the prosecution is not bound to prove a motive for the offence,

though, it can suggest a motive and when it does so the judge may

examine the motive so suggested.

Although an attempt had been made to implicate the husband of PW-02 as

the person who came to the scene with a knife, the evidence led in this

action clearly establish that he was never there, and was sleeping inside the

house. I find no basis for the argument that it was a third party who caused

injuries to the deceased. Therefore, I find no merit in the third ground of

appeal either.

The learned counsel for the appellant in his submissions contended that the

learned High Court judge should have considered the evidence on the basis

of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under section 296 exception

04 of the Penal Code.

Exception 04 of section 296 reads as follows;

Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a

sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue

advantage or acted in a cruel and unusual manner.

Explanation; -

It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the

provocation or commits the first assault.

It is correct to argue that even if an accused person did not raise a defence

based on exceptions to section 296 of the Penal Code, it is the duty of a trial

judge to consider whether there is evidence to such an exception, if there is

evidence on record.

Page 11 of 12

In the case of King Vs. Belana Withanage Eddin 41 NLR 345 Court of

Criminal Appeal held;

In a charge of murder, it is the duty of the judge to put to the jury, the

alternative of finding the accused guilty of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder when there is any basis for such a finding in the

evidence of record, although such defence was not raised nor relied upon

by the accused.

In King Vs. Vidanalage Lanty 42 NLR 317 the Court of Criminal Appeal

observed the following;

There was evidence in this case upon which it was open to the jury to say

that it came within exception 04 of section 296 of the Penal Code and that

the appellant was guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. No

such plea, however, was put forward on his behalf. In the course of his

address the presiding judge referred to this evidence as part of the defence

story, but not as evidence upon which a lessor verdict might possibly be

based.

Held:

It was the duty of the presiding judge to have so directed the jury

and that in the circumstances, the appellant was entitled to have the

benefit of a lesser offence.

In the instant action, the appellant has not taken up the position that there

was a sudden fight between the parties when the prosecution evidence was led

before the High Court, although the witnesses have been cross examined on

the basis of a quarrel. However, in his dock statement, it was his position that

he was assaulted by the witnesses and he ran away to escape them. He has

never taken up the position that the death of the deceased was a result of a

sudden fight. There was no evidence on record for the learned High Court judge

to consider such a defence.

Page 12 of 12

On the contrary, the evidence led has established beyond reasonable doubt,

that it was the appellant who came looking for deceased and assaulted her first

owing to a previous animosity between the parties. After that, PW 02 who came

to the aid of her mother has also been assaulted and dragged away. When the

deceased attempted to rescue the daughter from the clutches of the appellant

she has been fatally stabbed, which cannot be attributed to a sudden fight

under any circumstances.

However, it clearly appears form the judgment that the learned High Court

Judge has carefully analyzed the evidence before her to find whether there was

evidence to consider a defence under section 296(4) of the Penal Code and had

come to a correct finding in that regard.

The appeal, therefore, is dismissed as I find no merit in the appeal. The

conviction and the sentence affirmed.
