Before Menaka Wijesundera J.

Neil Iddawala J.

Counsel Anil Silva PC with N. Perera for the Petitioner petitioner.

Chathurangi Mahawaduge, SC for the state.

Argued On 03.08.2021

Decided On 31.08.2021

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to revise the order dated 9.2.2021 of

the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw.

The suspect by the name of Mohamed Anwer Mohamed Fawaz had been serving as a

Warf Clerk in the company by the name of N.M.B Clearing and forwarding Agency at

the time of the alleged offence. He had been taken in to custody by the Narcotics

Bureau on the 12th of March 2020 at Orugodawatta terminal for aiding and abetting to

import a gross quantity of heroin 99kg and 478 grams under the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance punishable under sections 54A and 54B.

The position of the petitioner is that the above named suspect had been serving as the

Warf Clerk at the above mentioned clearing company and when his Superiors ordered

him to clear a consignment of potatoes he done so and the Narcotics Bureau on

information received had inspected the said consignment at Luniwila and found an

alleged substance which was later identified to be heroin, of which he had no

knowledge and he only carried out his duty as a Warf Clerk, therefore his incarceration

since March 2020 is not justified and the lack of evidence is exceptional enough to

enlarge him on bail.

The position of the learned State Counsel is that the matter is under consideration and

concedes that that the suspect above named served as the Warf Clerk in the company

which cleared the alleged consignment of potatoes.

Upon considering the submissions of both parties this Court takes in to consideration

the provisions in the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance under which a

person suspected of or accused of an offence under section 54A and 54B shall be

enlarged on bail only upon exceptional circumstances.

The term exceptional has been defined in many a decided cases in our legal case law

and finally it has been decided that exceptionality should be considered as per the

circumstances of each case as well stand in Ramu Thamodarumpillai vs. Attorney

General 2004 3 SLR 180.

In the instant case this Court observes that the suspect above named has served in the

capacity of a Warf clerk in the company which cleared the alleged consignment and he

had not received it neither has he ordered it, he has only carried out an order by the

company he was serving as an employee.

Therefore this Court is of the view that upon such material it is not fair and just to keep

the above named suspect in remand, and this Court also observes that the learned

State Counsel is unable to furnish any more incriminating evidence against the above

named suspect.

But the above mentioned position has not been considered by the learned High Court

judge in the impugned order which this Court observes to be sufficiently exceptional to

enlarge the suspect namely Mohamed Anwer Mahamed Fawaz the 11thsuspect on bail.

Hence the instant application for revision is allowed and the suspect Mahamed Anwer

Mohamed Fawaz is enlarged on the following conditions of bail,

1) A cash bail of Rupees five hundred thousand, 2) Two sureties to the value of Rupees one million each, 3) The suspect to report to the Narcotics Bureau on every 4th Sunday of each

month 4) The suspect to surrender his passport to the Registrar of the relevant High Court.

The Registrar of this Court is hereby directed to convey this order to the relevant High

Court.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
