The Appellant submitted its monthly Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as VAT) returns for the period of 1st January 2008 to 31st December 2008, and those returns were rejected by the Assessor on the ground that the volume/contingent discounts given to customers at the end of each month, based on the volume of purchases, were not deductible in the computation of VAT under VAT Act No. 14 of 2002, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the VAT Act). Accordingly, the Assessor made an additional assessment in terms of Section 31 of the VAT Act and issued an intimation letter under Section 29 of the Act. Accordingly, the balance VAT payable was Rs. 9,766,684/- (vide annexure 1 to the letter of intimation dated 23rd April 2010). The parties have agreed that the Appellant received a notice of assessment thereafter. The Appellant appealed to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (hereinafter referred to as the CGIR) against the said assessment. The CGIR, in his determination dated 28th August 2012, confirmed the additional assessments made by the Assessor and notice was given to the Appellant on 29thAugust 2012, in accordance with Section 34 (12) of the VAT Act. Thereafter, the Appellant appealed to the Tax Appeals Commission (hereinafter referred to as the TAC) in terms of Section 7 of the TAC Act No. 23 of 2011, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the TAC Act).

Oriflame sold its products to these beauty consultants at a price 30% below the catalogue price, constituting the first discount (comparable to the trade discount in the instant appeal). Other than this discount granted at the time of sale, the beauty consultants were also given a performance discount based on the quantity of purchases made in a particular month, which constituted the second discount.

Nor does the 2007 VAT Manual suggest a prohibition of tax adjustments on account of any type of discount.
