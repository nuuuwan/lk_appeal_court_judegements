Arjuna Obeyesekere J., P/CA

The Petitioners state that in 2017, the University Grants Commission [the UGC]

introduced a new syllabus for those sitting the General Certificate in Education

(Advanced Level) examination [the A/L exam] for the first time in 2019. The

introduction of a new syllabus meant that there were two categories of students

sitting for the A/L exam in 2019 the first being those who were sitting the A/L exam

for the first time in 2019 under the new syllabus and the second being those who

3

had followed a course of study under the old syllabus and who were repeating the

A/L exam in 2019 under the old syllabus.

The Petitioners are eight students who have sat the A/L exam from the Biological

stream for the first time under the new syllabus from the Kurunegala District. The

Petitioners state that having obtained a Z score of 1.8172 and above, each of them

entertained an expectation of being selected to a Medical Faculty of a State

University. The Petitioners state further that in October 2020, the UGC released two

Z score cut off marks, one for those who were repeating the A/L exam under the old

syllabus and another for those who were sitting the A/L exam for the first time under

the new syllabus. Thus, the UGC was treating those who had the sat for the A/L exam

under the new syllabus for the first time as a different population to those who were

repeating the A/L exam under the old syllabus. The end result, as claimed by the

Petitioners, was that the Petitioners did not secure entry to a Medical Faculty even

though they had obtained a higher Z score than those who had been selected to a

Medical Faculty having repeated the A/L exam under the old syllabus.

Aggrieved by their non-selection, the Petitioners and several others who were

similarly circumstanced as the Petitioners challenged the above decision of the UGC

in the Supreme Court by way of several Fundamental Rights Applications. It is

admitted that those applications were supported before the Supreme Court on

several dates and that leave to proceed was refused by the Supreme Court on 23rd

December 2020.

The Petitioners thereafter filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the UGC to impose separate cut off

marks for the old syllabus and the new syllabus;

b) A Writ of Mandamus directing the UGC to prepare the cut off mark based on

one single list (for both at district level and at national level);

c) A Writ of Mandamus directing the UGC to admit the Petitioners to a Medical

Faculty of a State University.

4

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the facts of this

application, the grievance of the Petitioners and the relief sought by the Petitioners

are identical to the Fundamental Rights application filed by these same Petitioners.

Consequently, the learned Deputy Solicitor General raised the following three

preliminary objections relating to the maintainability of this application:

a) The matters raised in this application have been considered by the Supreme

Court in SC (FR) Application No. 329/2020 and the principle of Res Judicata

would prevent this Court from going into this matter;

b) Even if the principle of Res Judicata does not apply, the identical issue has been

considered by the Supreme Court and the principle of Issue Estoppel would

prevent this Court from going into this matter;

c) This application is an abuse of process which does not warrant the discretion of

this Court being exercised in favour of the Petitioners.

As this application involved the non-selection of students to a course of study of their

choice, this Court proceeded to hear the learned Presidents Counsel and the learned

Deputy Solicitor General on the merits of this matter as well as on the above legal

objections.

I shall at the outset consider the grievance of the Petitioners.

Where there is only one syllabus that is offered by all students, irrespective of

whether they are first time candidates or repeat candidates, all students are treated

as one population in what is commonly referred to as the Single Population Method.

Based on the Subject Z-Scores, a common Z-Score will be prepared for all the

students and the aggregate of the subject Z scores would determine selection to

University.

The 2019 Advanced Level examination saw the introduction of two populations of

students first time students who followed the new syllabus that had been

introduced two years earlier and repeaters (those who were sitting the A/L exam for

the second and third time) who followed the old syllabus. Thus, with two distinct

5

populations of students, the UGC was required to determine the basis of selection to

State Universities.

A similar syllabus change had been introduced in 2011. On that occasion, the UGC

had grouped all the students (Old and New Syllabus) together and used one Z-Score

to determine entry to a university. That decision having been challenged by way of a

fundamental rights application,1 the Supreme Court had directed the UGC to treat

the old syllabus and new syllabus students as two distinct populations and to have

two separate Z-Scores calculated for them.

The UGC had accordingly adopted and maintained two separate populations for 2019

and maintained that distinction right up to the admission of students to a University.

The issue however was to determine the ratio between these two populations or in

other words to determine how many from those who had followed the new syllabus

should be admitted as opposed to those who had followed the old syllabus. This has

been addressed by the UGC adopting a method known as the Composite Average

that is by taking the percentage of students who had gained University admission on

their first attempt at the A/L exam during the preceding five year period and

thereafter taking the average thereof, thereby determining the percentage of

vacancies that must be apportioned to those who sat (for the first time) under the

new syllabus. This would then automatically decide the percentage (of repeaters)

that should get into a University from the old syllabus. The same procedure had been

followed for the all-island merit list as well as the district list.

The above could be understood from the following example, where random figures

have been used for the years 2013 2017.

Year 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Composite

Average

Freshers 40% 45% 50% 43% 47% 45%

Repeaters 60% 55% 50% 57% 53% 55%

1 Vide SC (FR) Application No. 29/2012; SC Minutes of 25th June 2012 marked P5.

According to the method that was adopted by the UGC, the new syllabus students

and old syllabus students are treated as two different populations, and subject Z-

Scores are calculated separately for old-syllabus and new syllabus subjects.

Thereafter, the Z-Score of the students are calculated separately for the two groups

(Old Syllabus and New Syllabus). The two groups of students are ranked separately

based on their Z-Scores and the available places for a particular course of study are

apportioned between the two groups on the basis of the composite average of the

ratios between freshers and repeaters who were admitted to that particular course

of study during the preceding five year period. The learned Deputy Solicitor General

submitted that the UGC used the composite average from 2013-2017 for the 2019

Advanced Level Examinations (i.e. 2019/2020 University Admissions), as that was the

processed data that was available to the UGC at the time. The above position has

been conveyed to the public by a notice dated 8th April 2019 marked P8.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that he does not have

an issue with having two separate Z scores for those who sat the A/L exam under

the two different syllabi. His grievance is that having determined the separate Z

scores, the two-population system must stop at that point and that all students must

be pooled together thereby having one population or what is referred to as a

combined list in order to determine selection to a University. The learned Presidents

Counsel for the Petitioner submitted further that the UGC erred when it decided to

use the composite average method in allocating places to the Medical Faculty.

The issue that I must then consider is whether the decision of the UGC to adopt the

composite average method as opposed to the combined list method is unreasonable

or irrational.

In exercising judicial review, Courts play a limited role and must be mindful not to

substitute its own decision for that of the public authority who has been conferred

with the power of making that decision, unless the authority has disregarded

material facts or where the decision is unsupported by substantial evidence. In the

words of Lord Bingham, they (judges) are auditors of legality; no more, but no less.2

As pointed out in Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth:3

The doctrine that powers must be exercised reasonably has to be reconciled

with the no less important doctrine that the court must not usurp the discretion

of the public authority which Parliament appointed to take the decision.

Decisions which are extravagant or capricious cannot be legitimate. But if the

decision is within the confines of reasonableness, it is no part of the courts

function to look further into its merits.

In Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service,4 Lord Diplock

having identified the three grounds upon which administrative action is subject to

judicial review, went onto describe irrationality as follows:

"By 'irrationality' I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as 'Wednesbury

unreasonableness.5 It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its

defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who

had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it. "

The test routinely applied to assess the reasonableness of a decision is the test set

out in Associated Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v. Wednesbury Corporation,6

where Lord Greene defined unreasonableness as something so absurd that no

sensible person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority. The

famous example of the red-haired teacher who was dismissed due to the colour of

her hair, illustrates the high threshold for unreasonableness that was expected to

justify judicial intervention on this ground.

English Courts have attempted to reduce the rigour of Wednesbury

unreasonableness over the years. The case of Secretary of State for Education and

Science v Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council,7 decided prior to the GCHQ case

provides for the following, which can be considered a more balanced test:

3Supra; page 302. 4 [1985] 1 AC 374 (the GCHQ Case). 5 Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1948] (1) KB 223 6 [1948] 1 K.B. 223 at pages 229 - 230. 7 [1977] AC 1014.

In public law, unreasonable as descriptive of the way in which a public

authority has purported to exercise a discretion vested in it by statute has

become a term of legal art. To fall within this expression it must be conduct

which no sensible authority acting with due appreciation of its responsibilities

would have decided to adopt.

It has been held that the standard adopted in Tameside appears to be more realistic,

and balanced.8 I therefore intend to apply the less rigorous test in deciding whether

the UGC has acted reasonably.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that the Supreme Court decision in

2011 was silent on whether the Petitioners method should be used or whether the

Respondents method should be used. The UGC had commenced the consideration

of this issue well before the Advanced Level examinations in 2019. Preparatory work

had started very early and the UGC had appointed an Expert Committee consisting of

eminent academics in the field of Statistics and Mathematics as well as

representatives from the Department of Census and Statistics and the Central Bank

to consider the appropriate mechanism to deal with the special situation that would

arise with the introduction of a new syllabus in 2019.

It is clear from the Report of the Expert Committee that they had considered

different methods and arrived at two options. The first option recommended the

composite average method as Option 1 which involved allocating places based on

the previous 5-year (2013 2017) composite averages of the entry percentages of

first-time candidates and repeaters. The second option was to simply calculate the

Z-scores of first-time candidates and repeaters as two different populations and

thereafter place them on a common rank list. Option No.2 that was considered by

the Experts Committee is referred to as the Combined List. Under this option, those

students who had sat the new syllabus and old syllabus are treated as two separate

populations and are assigned separate Subject Z-Scores. Thus there would be

separate Subject Z-Scores for the Biology New Syllabus Paper and the Biology Old

8Colonel U.R. Abeyratne v. Lt. Gen. N.U.M.M.W. Senanayake and Others, CA (Writ) Application No. 239/2017; CA Minutes of 7th February 2020; Also see KIA Motors (Lanka) Limited v. Consumer Affairs Authority, CA (Writ) Application No. 72/2013; CA Minutes of 26th May 2020; U.A.A.J Ukwatte and another v. Minister of Education and others, CA (Writ) Application No. 403/2019; CA Minutes of 12th June 2020.

Syllabus Paper. Based on the separate Subject Z-Scores, the average would be

obtained, which would be the students Z-Score. Thus the two populations of Old

Syllabus students and New Syllabus students will have two different Z-Scores.

Thereafter, the two groups are amalgamated for a Combined List and this

Combined List will rank all the Z Scores regardless of whether they are Old Syllabus

or New Syllabus. This method was considered as Option 2 in the Expert Committee

Report. The Petitioners have requested that this method be used, and have filed an

opinion from Professor R. Thatil, marked as P6,9 in support thereof.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that the second option was rejected

by the Expert Committee due to the fact that the distributions of the two

populations (of first-time candidates and repeaters) were not identical. He stated

that the Z-score method is based on the assumption that the underlying

distributions are identical and that having examined the historical data, the Expert

Committee confirmed that the mean, skewness and kurtosis between the two

populations were significantly different. It was his submission that when there is a

significant difference in the distributions the Z-score method is not reliable and will

lead to anomalies.

The UGC accepted the recommendation of the Expert Committee and published the

Notice P8 in daily newspapers of all three languages and repeated the Notice on

12th May 2019 in the weekend newspapers of all three languages. The UGC issued

the Handbook relating to admission to undergraduate courses of the Universities in

Sri Lanka for the Academic Year 2019/2020 around 5th March 2020. The said

Handbook has specifically reiterated the method of admission indicated in the above

Notices at pages 9 and 227, thereof. Thus, those sitting for the examination in 2019

were placed on notice and the position of the UGC has been made known even prior

to them sitting the A/L exam in 2019.

When I consider the above material, which material I must state was available to the

Supreme Court when it considered the application of the Petitioners in December

2020, it is clear that the UGC:

9 Prof. Thattil was part of the Presidential Committee that recommended the same approach in 2012, which was rejected by the Supreme Court, and a settlement order was issued in SCFR/418/2012 using the maximum ratio method described in the limited objections.

10

(a) has obtained the services of an Expert Committee to consider the various

options that were available and propose the best possible solution that is

reasonable to all;

(b) has specifically considered the method proposed by the Petitioners and has

rejected it for the reasons set out in the report of the Expert Committee;

(c) has considered the issue thoroughly and in a timely manner;

(d) given all students timely notice of the proposed method even prior to them

sitting the A/L exam.

I am therefore satisfied that the UGC has acted reasonably and that the decision of

the UGC to apply the composite average method is a decision which a sensible

authority acting with due appreciation of its responsibilities would have decided to

adopt.

This brings me to the three legal objections that were raised by the learned Deputy

Solicitor General. In view of the conclusion that I have reached that the decision of

the UGC is neither unreasonable nor irrational, I do not think it is necessary for me to

engage in a lengthy discussion on the first two objections, suffice to state that a

Petitioner who has had a full hearing before the Supreme Court spanning over three

days certainly cannot seek to re-agitate the same issue before this Court.

This issue has been considered on several occasions in the recent past in the context

of petitioners who keep coming back to this Court after their first attempt has been

unsuccessful. In Vehicles Lanka (Private) Ltd and another v. Jagath Premalal

Wijeweera, Director General of Customs and Others,10 Malalgoda, J / PCA (as he

then was) stated that:

this court is not inclined to reconsider the same issues which were considered

once by this court. It is trite law that there needs to be finality to litigation and

therefore parties [are] estopped from bringing multiple suits on the same

issues resulting in overburdening the court.

10 CA (Writ) Application No. 446/2014; CA Minutes of 12th February 2016.

11

Similar sentiments were expressed in Ensen Trading and Industry (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Mangala Samaraweera and Others11 where this Court cited the following passage from New Brunswick Rail Co. v. British and French Trust Corporation Ltd,12 to explain the rationale for adopting the principle that the same issue cannot be re-litigated:

The doctrine of estoppel is one founded on considerations of justice and good sense. If an issue has been distinctly raised and decided in an action, in which both parties are represented, it is unjust and unreasonable to permit the same issue to be re-litigated afresh between the same parties or persons claiming under them. The submission that a petitioner cannot continue to agitate the same matter over and over again brings me to the final objection raised by the learned Deputy Solicitor General, namely that this action is an abuse of the process of Court. I agree with the said submission and take the view that this Court, in the exercise of its Writ jurisdiction, will not exercise its discretion in favour of these Petitioners who are seeking to re-agitate an issue ad nauseum. Thus, on this ground alone, I am of the view that this is not a fit matter where the discretion of this Court must be exercised in favour of the Petitioners. In the above circumstances, I see no legal basis to issue formal notice of this application on the Respondents. This application is accordingly dismissed.
