Judgment

This is an Appeal against the Order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Sabaragamuwa

Province holden in Ratnapura dated 07.10.2015.

The Plaintiff-Respondent [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Respondent] made an

Application on 31.12.2012 in terms of Section 3 of the State Land (Recovery of Possession)

Act No 07 of 1979 as amended, to the Magistrate Court of Avissawella to evict the

Respondent -Petitioner-Appellant [hereinafter referred to as the Appellant] from the State

land described in the schedule in the application.

After supporting the application, the Notice of Quit was sent to the Appellant with the

application. It appears that the Appellant had shown cause against the said application by way

of statement of objections dated 6.12.2013.

Page 4 of 10

It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that the Appellant was recruited to the post of

Office Assistant to the Talduwa Estate Office of Malawatta Valley Plantation Limited, with

effect from 1st July 1994. The Appellant was provided quarters from the Talduwa Estate on

free of rent and the Appellant was occupying the Quarters since 1994.

Although the Appellants services were terminated in 1996, he was never informed or

requested to Quit from the Quarters after the termination from the services by the

Management of Malwatte Valley Plantation Limited.

It was further submitted that the Appellant had spent his own money to repair the quarters

with the oral consent of the Management of the Malawatte Valley Plantation Limited.

The Appellant had taken up the position that the Legislature had not permitted Plantation

companies which had taken estates on lease to apply provisions of state lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No.07 of 1979 as amended to eject the persons occupying the estate quarters.

However, the Learned Magistrate had delivered the order to eject the Appellant from the

quarters, led by the Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said Order dated 29.08.2014, the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant

had invoked the Revisionary Jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Avissawella. After

filing of written submissions by both the parties, the Learned High Court Judge delivered the

Order affirming the said Order of the Learned Magistrate.

Page 5 of 10

This Appeal is made against the said Order of the Provincial High Court dated 07.10.2015 by

the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant.

It was the position taken up by the Appellant in this Appeal that the land in dispute is a state

land, vested to the Janatha Estate Development Board (JEDB). In 1992, the government had

taken a decision to vests the estates owned by Janatha Estate Development Board (JEDB) and

Sri Lanka State Plantatition (SLSPC) with the formation of the conversion of Public

Corporation or government owned business undertakings into public Companies Act No 23

of 1987.

On the above decision of the government, the estate which was managed by the Janatha

Estate Development Board (JEDB) and Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation (SLSPC)

were vested to the Public Companies incorporated under the provisions of the Act No 23 of

1987, order published by the Extra Ordinary Gazette No. 720/2 dated 22.06.1992.

According to the said gazette, it was submitted that, Talduwa Estate which was managed by

the Janatha Estate Development Board (JEDB) was vested to the Malwatte Valley Plantation

Limited. As a result of the said conversion of the estates, Janatha Estate Development Board

(JEDB) no longer has the control over the estates vested to the Public Companies. Thus, the

Janatha Etate Development Board (JEDB) has no authority over the Talduwa Estate, since

22.06.1992.

As such, it was the contention of the Appellant that since then, Talduwa Estate is manged and

controlled by the Malwatte Valley Plantation Limited. Thus, Talduwa Estate was not re-

Page 6 of 10

vested to the Janatha Estate Development (JEDB) and the Janatha Estate Development

(JEDB) had no control or function over Talduwa Estate.

Furthermore, it was submitted by the Appellant that Malwatte Valley Plantation Limited was

incorporated under the Companied Act No 17 of 1982, under the provisions of conversions of

Public Corporations or Government Owned Business undertakings into Public Companies.

Therefore, it is governed by the Companies act.

Hence, the Respondent cannot act as a competent authority of the Talduwa Estate and has no

lawful power or authority to make an application under the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act to the Magistrates Court to obtain an Order to evict the Appellant. Thus, it

was contended that the Learned Magistrate has no jurisdiction to act upon the application of

the Respondent for ejectment of the Appellant from the disputed premises.

On the contrary, it was submitted on behalf of the Respondent that Section 3 of the

conversion of public corporations or government owned business undertaking in to public

companies Act No 23 of 1987 has enacted that the properties of the corporation are vested

with the companies.

As a matter of fact, thus the companies have been granted lease for a period of 53 years. The

Gazette No. 720/2 dated 22.06.19992 as referred by the Appellant even does not state that

immovable properties were vested with the companies. Accordingly, the ownership of the

land is remained with the state, Janatha Estate Development (JEDB).

In view of the aforesaid position of the Respondent, it was cited the case of Mrs. D.F

Ganesha Vs Manoja Jayanethi competent authority Ministry of Plantation Industries,

CA (Writ) Application No.714/2008 decided on 18.10.2010 by Sriskandarajah J.

In this Judgment, it was referred to S.C Appeal No 19/2005 dated 25.10.2006, the applicant

in the said case was Bogawantalawa plantation Limited was an Estate vested with the land

Reform Commission and later with the Sri Lanka Plantation Corporation [SLPC}.

Apparently, the Respondent in the said case was an employee of the SLPC and was permitted

to occupy the land in question on payment of a sum of Rs. 50/- per month as rent.

Subsequently, the estates vested with he SLPC were leased to Companies established in terms

of the conversion of Public Corporations or Government owned business undertakings into

public Companies Act No 23 of 1987. Bogawanthalawa Plantations Ltd was thus

incorporated by an Order dated 22.06.1992 made in terms of the Act. The Bogawanthalawa

Estate within which the land occupied by the Respondent is admittedly situated was leased by

the SLPC to Bogawathalawa Plantations Ltd by the lease bearing No 83 dated 18.01.1994.

The lease is for a period of 99 years and contains a provision for prior termination.

On these facts, the Supreme Court held in the said Case said that the land remained vested in

the Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation. Therefore, the State lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act would apply to eject a person in illegal occupation of these lands.

In the said case, the Supreme Court recognized the power and entitlement of the competent

authority appointed under the state lands (Recovery of Possession) Act to issue notices of

Quit to eject the occupier from a state land.

Page 8 of 10

Having considered the said findings of the Supreme Court, His Lordship Justice

Sriskandarajah emphasized in the case of Mrs. D.F Ganesha Vs. Manoja Jayanetti

competent authority (supra), the lessee of the subject matter is a private concern has no

relevance as long as the land is vested with the JEDB.

In view of the aforesaid findings, it is apparent that the contention of the Appellant that the

Respondent in the instant case has no authority to initiate these proceedings has no basis.

It is to be noted that the Respondent had formed the opinion in terms of Section 3 of the Act

being the Competent Authority that the land in question is a state land and served the notice

of Quit to the Appellant.

In such circumstances, it is the burden of the Appellant to prove that she is in occupation or

possession of the land in question, on a valid permit or other written authority of the state

grant according to any other written Law. If this burden is not discharged by the Appellant

the only option to the Magistrate to make an Order for ejectment. The said position was

established in the case of Muhandiram Vs Chairman JEDB 1992 (1) S.L.R 110.

Similarly, Justice Dehideniya held;

In the case of M.C Margaret Perera Vs Divisional Secretary Naula [C.A/ PHC/41/2010]

(C.A Minutes 31.01.2017) the scope of an inquiry under section 9 of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act is limited to;

1. Occupying the land on a permit or a written authority.

2. It must be a valid permit or a written Authority.

3. It must be in force at the time of presenting it to Court.

Page 9 of 10

4. It must be in force at the time of presenting it to Court.

5. It must have been issued in accordance with any Written Law.

Further it was held that the party noticed is not entitled to challenge the opinion of the

competent authority on any matters stated in the Application.

Therefore, it is clear that in an action to recover Possession of a State Land, the only available

defense for the Possessor sought to be evicted from the subject Land, is to establish that he is

in Possession or Occupation of the land upon a valid Permit or other Written authority of the

State granted according to any Written Law.

Apparently, the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant has not submitted any document, valid

permit or grant to substantiate the fact that he had written permission or authority to occupy

the state land in question.

Therefore, in the absence of Written authority or a valid permit to occupy the State land at the

time of serving the Notice of Quit, the Learned Magistrate has correctly issued the eviction

order against the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant.

Be that as it may, it appears that in Section 9 (1) of the said Act stipulates another restriction

on the Respondent which was dealt by Justice Wengappuli in the Case of J.M Chandrika

Priyadharshani [The competent authority] Vs Loku Hettiarachchige Seneviratne. [C.A

Minutes 13.07.2018].

At such inquiry, the person on whom summons under section 6 has been served

shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in the application under

Section 5 except that he is in Possession or occupation of the land upon a valid

permit or other written authority of the state granted in accordance with any written

Page 10 of 10

Law and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise

rendered invalid.

Furthermore, Section 5(1) imposes a duty on the Competent Authority to set out certain facts

in his Application for ejectment and has included these factors in Section 5 (1)(a) and (b).

Section 5 (1) (a) (i) of the Act reads that he is a Competent Authority for the purpose of this

Act.

In terms of Sections 5 (1) (a) (i) and Section 9 (1) it is clear that the intention of the

Legislature is to impose a restriction on the Respondent in an application for ejectment, the

Respondent is precluded by contesting before the Magistrates Court against the claim by the

Competent Authority, in terms of the Application made under Section 5 of the Act.

In view of the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that the grounds of appeal raised on

behalf of the Appellant are without merit thus the Appeal has to be dismissed.

As such, we are not inclined to interfere with the Order dated 31.03.2016 by the Learned

Additional Magistrate and the Order dated 23.05.2016 by the Learned High Court Judge.

Hence, the said impugned Orders are affirmed and the Appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at

Rs.25,000/-.
