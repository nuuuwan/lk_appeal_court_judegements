This is a revision application against the order of the Learned Provincial High

Court Judge of Kegalle dated 18.10.2019, which affirmed the order of forfeiture

of a vehicle by the Learned Magistrate of Kegalle under section 40 (1) of the Forest

Ordinance (as amended).

The petitioner is the registered owner of the vehicle bearing no. SG LB 0640

which was driven by one Menik Pedige Dilshan Sangeeth Jayasinghe on the day

both the vehicle and the driver were taken into custody under the provisions of

the Forest Ordinance. The said Menik Pedige Dilshan Sangeeth Jayasinghe was

charged in the Magistrate Court of Kegalle in case bearing case no 11151/WL/17

for transporting timber without a permit, an offence punishable under section

25(2) read with section 40 of the Forest Ordinance. He was found guilty on his

own plea and thereafter he was imposed a fine.

Subsequently, an inquiry for confiscation of the vehicle ensued, at the end of

which the Learned Magistrate delivered his order of confiscation on 24.09.2019.

Against the said order, the petitioner preferred a revision application to the High

CA/PHC/APN-139/19 Page 4 of 10 09/11/2021

Court (Case No. 5572/ REV), which affirmed the confiscation without issuing

notice on the respondents. Being aggrieved, the petitioner has now come before

this Court by way of revision praying for inter alia the following:

1. Revise the order dated 18.10.2019 of the Provincial High Court, Kegalle

setting aside the same and direct the Learned Judge of the Provincial High

Court, Kegalle to issue notice on the respondents and fix case No. 5572/

Revision hearing.

2. Set aside the order of the Learned Magistrate Kegalle on 24.09.2019

As such, this court has been invited to use its revisionary jurisdiction to

determine whether the impugned orders are illegal, irregular, arbitrary and/or

in contravention of the law.

As enunciated in G. W. Wijeratne v Attorney General CA(PHC) 77/08 CA Minute

dated 15.02.2018 under the provisions of the Forest Ordinance, the right of

appeal is specifically taken away from an aggrieved party after a claim. In this

situation, an aggrieved party need not show exceptional circumstances but must

show illegality or some form of procedural impropriety to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction of an appellate court as decided by His Lordship Ranjit Silva J, in

Ratnayake Mudiyanselage Muthubanda Ratnayake v Gallamanage Titus

Jayathillake CA(PHC) No 82/97.

At the outset, an examination of the applicable law is warranted. The enactment

of the Forest Ordinance (hereinafter referred to as the Ordinance) dates to early

1900. Since then, the ordinance has undergone multiple amendments, the last

of which was by Act No. 65 of 2009.

The law relating to conservation, protection and sustainable management of

forest resources as contained in the Ordinance, has seen a steady evolution

through legislative interventions and judicial interpretations. A considerable

body of law has emerged regarding confiscation inquiries under the Ordinance

where third parties may submit a claim against such confiscations.

CA/PHC/APN-139/19 Page 5 of 10 09/11/2021

Section 40 of the original Ordinance empowers Magistrate to confiscate all tools,

boats carts and cattle used in committing a forest offence. The original Section

40 of the Ordinance (Ordinance No 16 of 1907) as follows;

When any person is convicted of a forest offence, all timber or forest

produce which is not the property of the Crown in respect of which such

offence has been committed, and all tools, boats carts, and cattle used

in committing such offence, shall be liable, by order of the convicting

Magistrate to confiscation. Such confiscation may be in addition to any

other punishment prescribed for such offence.

However, the law at the time did not make provisions for instances where the

owner of such property was a third party. In response to this, early case law

precedent suggests a judicial recognition of the audi alteram partem rule where

an opportunity was granted to such third party to show cause against an order

of confiscation

In Rasiah v Tambirajah 53 NLR 574, Justice Nagalingam made the following

observations: It is one of the fundamentals of administration of justice that a

person should not be deprived either of his liberty or of his property without an

opportunity being given to him to show cause against such an order being madeI

think if the owner can show that the offence was committed without his knowledge

and without his participation in the slightest degree justice would seem to demand

that he should be restored his property.

Similarly, in Manawadu v The Attorney General (1987) 2 SLR 30 Justice

Seneviratne observed Our Constitution and other laws have provisioned the

implementation of which will result in no one being arbitrarily deprived of his

private property guaranteed by Human Rights. In my view the relevant section of

the Forest Ordinance is not arbitrary deprivation of property, but the deprivation

of property by due process of law, to deal with an economic crime.

CA/PHC/APN-139/19 Page 6 of 10 09/11/2021

Finally, this development in case law precedent received statutory recognition by

the enactment of Forest (Amendment) Act No. 65 of 2009 which introduced the

present Section 40, which reads:

(1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence

(a) all timber or forest produce which is not the property of the State in

respect of which such offence has been committed; and

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in committing

such offence, shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such

offence, be confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence, is a third

party, no Order of Confiscation shall be made if such owner proves

to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to

prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and

machines, as the case may be, for the commission of the offence.

(Emphasis added)

The law as it stands at present affords an opportunity for a third party to submit

a claim for his vehicle prior to a confiscation order is granted against it. Thus,

the legislature has statutorily incorporated the audi alteram partem rule in

confiscation inquiries vis--vis the Forest (Amendment) Act No. 65 of 2009.

Moreover, the legislature has delineated an additional burden on such third

party, under which he must satisfy the court that he had taken all precautions

to prevent the use his property for the commission of the forest offence.

Hence, any owner whose vehicle has been utilised for a commission of a forest

offence, and who holds knowledge, participate, or consent to the commission of

such offence would be barred from relying on the proviso of section 40(1).

Alternatively, if such owner does not possess knowledge or is unaware of his

vehicle being used for the commission of a forest offence, he is required by law

CA/PHC/APN-139/19 Page 7 of 10 09/11/2021

to satisfy the court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of his

vehicle for the commission of the offence.

The present application falls within the latter scenario.

In applying the proviso of the amended Section 40(1) of the Ordinance to the

facts and circumstances of the present case, guidance can be taken from judicial

pronouncements post 2009 amendment.

In Samarasinghege Dharmasena v W. P. Wanigasinghe and Others CA(PHC)

197/2013 CA Minute dated 22.01.2019, Justice K.K. Wickremasinghe had

referred multiple judgements on the application of section 40(1) and had

pronounced the following: ...it is well settled law that in a vehicle inquiry the

claimant has to discharge his burden on a balance of probability. According to

section 40 of the Forest Ordinance (as amended) it is mandatory to prove on a

balance of probability that the owner took every possible precaution to prevent the

vehicle being used for an illegal activity

Having thus set out the law governing the present application, it is time to refer

to the facts of the case.

During the confiscation inquiry, the petitioner himself gave evidence and he was

later cross-examined by the first respondent. No other evidence was led by the

petitioner to support his claim. In dispensing the burden of satisfying the court

that he had taken all precautionary steps to prevent a commission of an offence

using his vehicle, the petitioner submitted that he acquired the assistance of

several other persons to keep check on the vehicle. This was due to his inability

to personally check on the vehicle as he was away for employment purposes and

only returned once a week. He further submitted that he gave verbal directions

to Menik Pedige Dilshan Sangeeth Jayasinghe to the same effect, prior to

entrusting him with the vehicle. Nevertheless, he failed to call any witnesses or

produce any other material to corroborate his testimony. His only submission

was that he was cross examined on the same day and that the respondents failed

to mark any contradictions.

CA/PHC/APN-139/19 Page 8 of 10 09/11/2021

It was contended on behalf of the respondent that the explanation given by the

petitioner failed to satisfy the court, on a balance of probability, that he had

dispensed his duty of taking all precautionary measures as envisioned by the

proviso of section 40(1) of the Ordinance, a determination affirmed by both the

Magistrate Court and the High Court.

Both the Magistrate Order in case no. 11151/WL/17 dated 24.09.2019 and the

High Court Order in case no. 5572/REV dated 18.10.2019, has considered the

evidence of the petitioner and concluded that he failed to satisfy the court as per

the proviso to section 40(1) of the Ordinance. This Court observes that the

Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge had carefully evaluated

all the evidence placed before them. Both were of the view that even though the

petitioner testified that he took precautions to prevent an offence being

committed, no evidence was produced in the inquiry to corroborate the same.

In a bid to sustainably manage and conserve forest resources in Sri Lanka, the

amendment to the Ordinance in 2009 increased the penalties of forest offences,

highlighting the significance of regulating the transport of timber. It is within

this context; the conduct of the petitioner be evaluated. As submitted by the

petitioner himself, he was away on employment: a context in which the degree of

preventive measures ought to be taken is much higher than in normal

circumstance. Though the petitioner claimed he utilised the assistance of others

to ensure the vehicle was not used for illegal activities, he failed to provide any

corroboration to that effect. In dispensing the burden imposed on a claimant

under section 40(1) of the ordinance, he cannot merely transfer the said burden

to others.

As highlighted in Samarasinghege Dharmasena v W. P. Wanigasinghe and

Others (supra), it is amply clear that simply giving instructions to the driver is

insufficient to discharge the burden cast on a vehicle owner. Therefore, merely

giving instructions alone will not fall under the possible preventive measures ought

to be taken by a vehicle owner

CA/PHC/APN-139/19 Page 9 of 10 09/11/2021

As rightly pointed by the counsel for the respondent, the petitioner could have

at least called the persons he enlisted for assistance as witnesses to satisfy the

court as to the efficacy of the precautionary measures he took. Moreover, he

could have satisfied the court by calling Menik Pedige Dilshan Sangeeth

Jayasinghe as a witness.

The Counsel appearing for the petitioner has relied upon the case of Atapattu

Mudiyanselage Sadi Banda v OIC Norton Bridge CA (PHC) 03/2013 dated

25.07.2014 and contended that, in determining whether a vehicle should be

confiscated, all relevant factors should be considered by the Magistrate.

Yet however it is to be noted that, in the instant case, the petitioner has failed to

adduce such evidence before the Learned Magistrates consideration to prove

such factors during the stage of inquiry. Thus, petitioner has failed to attend to

the burden of proof that falls upon the claimant under to sec. 40 (1) of the Forest

Ordinance

As such, it is pertinent to echo the observations made by Justice K. T.

Chithrasisiri in Samarathunga v Range Forest officer Anuradhapura CA-PHC

89/2013.the law referred to in the said proviso to section 40(1) of the Forest

Ordinance empowers a Magistrate to make an order releasing the vehicle used to

commit the offence, to its owner provided that the owner of the vehicle proves to

the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent

committing an offence under the said Ordinance. Nothing is forthcoming to show

that he has taken any precautionary measures to prevent an offence being

committed by using this vehicle though he was the person who had the power to

exercise control over the vehicle on behalf of the owner. Therefore. It is evident that

no meaningful step had been taken

Considering the above, this court finds no reason to interfere with either the

confiscation order dated 24.09.2019 delivered by the Learned Magistrate of

Kegalle or the order affirming the same delivered by the Learned High Court

Judge of Kegalle dated 18.10.2019.

CA/PHC/APN-139/19 Page 10 of 10 09/11/2021

Prior to conclusion, an observation must be made regarding an objection raised

by the State Counsel appearing for the respondents. It dealt with the duty cast

on a petitioner under the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 in

ensuring that the respondent receives the copies of the relevant proceedings of

the Court of First Instance under scrutiny. In exercising the jurisdiction

bestowed upon this Court, fundamental procedures enshrined in the Supreme

Court Rules cannot be dispensed with. Therefore, any petitioner coming before

this Court, praying for relief, must follow the duties and obligations imposed

upon them with genuine commitment.

The revision application is hereby dismissed without costs.
