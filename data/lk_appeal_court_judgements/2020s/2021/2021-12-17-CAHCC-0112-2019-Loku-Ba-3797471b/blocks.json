The learned High Court Judge has extensively dealt with the defence taken by the appellant at page 17 of his judgment (page 368 of the appeal brief). Although the appellant suggested grave and sudden provocation to the witness No. 4 in cross examination, he has suggested to PW1 and PW3 that in self defence he grabbed the katty from the deceased and swerved. His defence has not been consistent. As rightly mentioned in his judgment by the learned High Court Judge, the medical evidence shows that the cut injury to the top of the head could not have been caused by swerving the katty as testified by the appellant. It had been a hard cut injury caused intentionally on top of the head. The learned High Court Judge has carefully considered the evidence and rightly concluded that the appellant intentionally caused the death of the deceased. The learned High Court Judge also has given good and sufficient reasons for rejecting both the defences of grave and sudden provocation and right of self defence taken by the appellant on different instances during the trial. 9. The learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that the contradictions marked",
