JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam J

[01] The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter after referred as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General for committing an

offence under section 364(1) of the Penal Code on Madurappulige Nimali

Vijayanthi Fernando on or about 11th of February 2008 in the High Court

of Kandy.

[02] After a Non-Jury trial the Appellant was convicted as charged and was

sentenced to 12 years RI and a fine of Rs.20000/-. In default 01-year RI

imposed. In addition, Rs.200000/- was imposed as compensation payable

to the victim with a default sentence of 03 years RI.

[03] Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

[04] The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the

Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to

Covid 19 pandemic.

[05] On behalf of the Appellant following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

A. The Learned trial Judge has failed to correctly evaluate the

evidence relating to the identity of the Appellant.

B. The Learned Trial Judge failed to make a determination that

the prosecution had proved the identity of the appellant

beyond reasonable doubt, but has acted on a mere

presumption as to his identification.

C. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the importance

of the omission brought up by the defence and especially their

effect on the credibility of the prosecutrix.

D. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the

improbabilities of the prosecution version on the alleged

incident.

3 | P a g e

E. The Learned Trial Judge has erred in disregarding the glairing

discrepancies between the evidence of the prosecutrix and

medical evidence.

F. The Learned trial Judge has failed to consider the lack of

credibility of the prosecutrix and has erred in law by neglecting

the need of cogent evidence on her part, especially in the

absence of any corroborating evidence.

[06] The prosecutrix in this case was living with her parents. She was

unmarried at the time of the incident. On the date of incident her mother

was hospitalized and she remained with her father who was 77 years of

age at that time. On that day at about 10.00pm when she went to the toilet

from the rear door to answer a call of nature a person had suddenly

appeared from rear of the toilet, dragged her after covering her mouth.

Thereafter she was put on the rough unfinished surface and raped.

Though she could not identify the person when he grabbed her from her

behind but she identified the Appellant when she was put on the ground

and raped. According to the prosecutrix she identified the Appellant from

the light emanating from her house and from the street light. The toilet

was situated behand her house.

Initially, she could not shout properly due to fear but raised cries when

she was raped by the Appellant. When her father responded to her cries

the Appellant had fled the scene very quickly. At that time the prosecutrix

did not disclose the act of rape to her father but informed the same to her

mother on the following day and lodged the complaint to the police. Her

father had passed away before giving evidence in court.

When the defence was called the Appellant had made a dock statement

and denied the incident.

[07] At the hearing the Learned Counsel for the Appellant had submitted his

argument in respect of appeal grounds A and B together. His contention

was that nowhere in the evidence of the victim has mentioned that the

appellant was identified by the light of the room inside the house and/or

the street light. Therefore, it is essential that the trial judge should have

4 | P a g e

evaluated the evidence with regard to such light to determine whether the

court be satisfied as to whether such light was sufficient to correctly

identify the Appellant.

The prosecutrix in her evidence had vividly explained the light condition

of the place of incident. As her house was under construction, no windows

had been fixed to her room and to the third room. On that day the 03rd

room light was kept on. Further a street light was also on at that time.

With these lights the place of incident was properly illuminated at that

time.

The identity of the Appellant had been revealed to the Medical Officer

who examined the prosecutrix after the incident. This had further

strengthened the prosecution case in respect of identity of the Appellant.

As there was no any contradiction or omission marked during the trial

with regard to the identity of the Appellant, the Learned High Court

Judge had very correctly concluded that the identity of the Appellant had

been very well established by the prosecution in this case.

In Punchibanduge Wijesinghe Rajaratne v. Attorney General CA 13/1994

decided on 23.01.1996 is a judgment which accepted the uncorroborated

testimony of the prosecutrix, where the evidence of the identity of the

accused solely on the evidence of the complainant. It was held that:

in the circumstances of the case it would have been unnecessary to

tell the jury additionally that it was uncorroborated in regard to the

identity of the accused.

Further, Turnbull Principles will not apply to the instant case as the

Appellant was a known person to the prosecutrix and the place of incident

was properly illuminated in the night when the incident took place.

Hence this appeal ground has no merit.

[08] The Counsel for the Appellant advanced his second ground with the

amalgamation of appeal grounds C and D. In his argument it was

submitted that the prosecutrix has deliberately tried to change or develop

5 | P a g e

her evidence, especially when improbabilities in her story were

highlighted during cross examination.

During the cross examination the prosecutrix told court that when she was

grabbed, she could not raise cries properly due to fear. But she had raised

cries despite her mouth being forcibly closed by the Appellant. In

addition, she had said that her father was suffering from hearing difficulty

at that time. As this was not told to police the relevant portion was marked

as an omission during the trial.

In the further cross examination, the prosecutrix told court that she only

told her father that the Appellant had assaulted her. She did not reveal the

rape incident. She further told that when she told about the assault, her

father had asked her where was the Appellant. This portion was marked

as an omission during the trial.

In her further cross examination, the prosecutrix told court that after the

sexual assault when she went to her room, the Appellant had thrown a

mortar in to her room through the grill of the window. According to her

this incident had been seen by her father. But she had failed to tell this to

the police. Thus, this was marked as an omission.

Under our law the trial judge could disregard minor contradictions and

omissions in a case if such contradictions and omissions do not go to the

root of the case. This orthodox position has been affirmed by several cases

in Sri Lanka. In the case of Mazur Ivegen & Iana Bereznah vs AG

SC/TAB/1/2015 Supreme court held that:

the contradictions and omissions marked by the defence are minor

contradictions and omissions which did not go to the root of the

prosecution case and therefore the lower court have correctly

disregarded the contradictions and omissions.

In the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa

[2011] SLR Vol. 2 pg. 292 held,

Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect

the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that

the Court must exercise its judgement on the nature of the

6 | P a g e

inconsistency or contradiction and whether they are material to the facts

in issue. Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and

assail the basic version of the witness cannot be given too much

importance.

Witnesses should not have disbelieved on account of trifling

discrepancies and omissions. When contradictions are marked, the Judge

should direct his attention to whether they are material or not and the

witness should be given an opportunity of explaining the matter.

In this case the Learned Trial Judge had properly considered above

mentioned omissions and came to a correct conclusion that the omissions

marked are incapable of creating a doubt on the prosecutrixs evidence.

Hence this appeal ground too has no merit.

[09] The next complaint of the Appellant is that the due consideration has not

been given to the discrepancies between the evidence of the prosecutrix

and the medical evidence.

Although the prosecutrix stated that she was unmarried and never had sex

with anybody, the medical evidence revealed that she would have either

engaged in sexual intercourse more than once or could have inserted any

tools repeatedly in to the vagina for some time. The learned High Court

Judge has considered this discrepancy in detail at page 214-215 of his

judgment and correctly held that this discrepancy will not lead to

disbelieve in the evidence of the prosecutrix.

The Counsel for the Appellant further argued that if the version of the

prosecutrix is true, she should have sustained more injuries on the back of

her body than mere tenderness, that only in two places. Hence it is difficult

to believe she did not sustain at least a small abrasion or a single contusion

on the back side of the body.

On perusal of the Medico-Legal Report of the prosecutrix, she had

sustained four painful injuries two on the back of the body and two on the

back of the fingers. According to the doctor all these injuries quite

compatible with the history given to the doctor by the prosecutrix.

7 | P a g e

As the medical evidence is properly analysed and considered in the

judgment by the Learned High Court Judge, this ground of appeal too has

no merit.

[10] Finally the Counsel of the Appellant contented that the Learned Trial judge

has failed to consider the lack of credibility of the prosecutrix and has erred

in law by neglecting the need of cogent evidence on her part, especially in

the absence of any corroborating evidence.

Justice Dheeraratne in Sunil and others v. Attorney General [1986] 1 Sri.L.

R 230 held that:

Corroboration is only required or afforded if the witness requiring

corroboration is otherwise credible. If the evidence of witness

requiring corroboration is not credible his testimony should be

rejected and the accused acquitted. Seeking corroboration of a

witnesss evidence should not be used as a process of inducing belief

in such evidence where such evidence is not credible.

It is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of a

woman victim of a sex offence but if her evidence is convincing such

evidence could be acted on even the absence of corroboration.

In Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat [1983] AIR 753 Indian

Supreme Court stated that:

refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault in the

absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding insult to injury.

In this case the evidence given by the prosecutrix was not tainted with any

contradiction. Although she had not informed her father about rape on that

night, but informed her mother on the following day and lodged her

complaint in the police.

According to the prosecutrix the Appellant could not perform full sexual

intercourse due her resistance and shouting for help. Although she raised

cries only her father responded but not the neighbours. Further there was no

reason for her to implicate anyone other than the Appellant. Considering the

8 | P a g e

evidence of the prosecutrix she was consistent right throughout in revealing

the incident.

This ground of appeal also fails as the Learned High Court Judge very

correctly acted on the overwhelming evidence given by the prosecutrix.

[11] We are of the view that there is no necessity to interfere with the conviction

of the Appellant. We therefore affirm the conviction and the sentence

imposed upon the Appellant.

Appeal is dismissed.
