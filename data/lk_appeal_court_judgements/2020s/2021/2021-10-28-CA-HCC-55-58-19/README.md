This is an appeal by 1st to 4th accused appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

appellants) on being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence of them by the

learned High Court judge of Hambantota.

The five accused named in the indictment were indicted before the High Court

of Hambantota on the following counts.

(1) For being members of an unlawful assembly on or around the 6th

October 2001 at a place called Uduwila within the jurisdiction of the

High Court of Hambantota, with the common object of causing

injuries to one Landage Jayasena, an offence punishable in terms of

section 140 of the Penal Code.

(2) At the same time and at the same place, causing the death of the said

Jayasena in furtherance of the said common object and thereby

committing an offence punishable in terms of section 296 read with

section 146 of the Penal Code.

(3) At the same time and at the same place, acting with common

intention and causing the death of the said Jayasena, thereby

committing an offence punishable in terms of section 296 read with

section 32 of the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, the Learned High Court judge of Hambantota by his

judgment dated 08-02-2019, found the appellants guilty on the 3rd count, and

they were acquitted of the 1st and the 2nd counts against them. The 5th accused

was acquitted of all three counts. The appellants were sentenced to death

accordingly.

This trial has proceeded against the 2nd appellant in absentia under the

provisions of section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, but was

arrested and produced in the Court before the judgment was pronounced.

At the hearing of the appeal, it was informed by the learned counsel for the 1st

and the 2nd appellants that, of the several grounds of appeal urged in the

written submissions, he is pursuing only the following ground of appeal.

(1) The learned trial judge has erred in law in failing to properly consider

that the PW-03 was not an independent witness and her evidence has

not been corroborated.

The learned counsel for the 3rd and the 4th appellants pursued the following

grounds of appeal.

(1) The 3rd accused appellant was denied a fair trial as the counsel

assigned to him has not been afforded sufficient time for the

preparation for the trial.

(2) Appellants have been denied of a fair trial, as the trial Court has

imposed a burden on the appellants to prove their innocence, thereby

shifting the burden of proof to the appellants and reversing the

presumption of innocence.

(3) Conflict of evidence between PW-03 and Police evidence relating to the

crime scene creates a serious doubt with regard to the authenticity of

the version of PW-03.

Facts in relation to the incident as uncovered by evidence, briefly, are as

follows;

Page 5 of 14

The main witness PW-01, namely, Pallage Ariyaratne was deceased at the time

the case went to trial before the High Court, and it was PW-03 Pallage

Ariyawathi who has given evidence as the eyewitness of the incident.

PW-03 and her brother PW-01 lived in adjacent houses facing Tissa-Matara

main road. On the day of the incident, namely 6th October 2001, at around

8.30 in the night, Ariyaratne was at the house of PW-03, and after hearing a

cry of a person from the direction of the main road, he has gone towards the

road to inquire. Few minutes later, he has come back running, informing the

witness that it was Jayasena who was assaulted and the assailants are chasing

after him. After Ariyaratne sought refuge in her house the persons who came

after him started damaging Ariyaratnes house, which has prompted the

witness to come out of her house. She has seen the 1st to 4th appellants whom

she knew very well as all of them are from the same village and neighbours.

She has had no difficulty in identifying them from the available light. After

causing damage to the doors and windows of Ariyaratnes house, the

appellants, having come in front of the house of PW-03 have called for

Ariyaratne. The witness has seen that it was the 2nd accused who called for her

brother and has also seen him armed with an iron rod.

When PW-03 told them to leave, the 1st and the 2nd appellants have started

scolding her in filth while threatening her too. After that all four who went

towards the road has started pelting stones towards the house, which resulted

in damages to the roof of the house and the electricity meter. She has admitted

that there was a minor animosity between her and the 1st appellant due to her

refusal to give her daughter in marriage to him. While this was happening, her

brother who sought refuge in the house has managed to leave the house from

the back door and had informed the Police about what was happening.

Police have come to the scene about half an hour later along with Ariyaratne,

and the appellants have bolted hearing the Police jeep. At that time the

deceased also had crawled towards the Police jeep with injuries. After hearing

Page 6 of 14

about the direction the appellants went, the Police jeep has left the scene

looking for them, leaving the deceased near the main road. While the Police

party was away, the appellants have returned to the place where the deceased

was. The witness has heard Sumith Wasantha the 2nd appellant saying

and has seen the deceased being dragged toward the nearby

reservation. She has seen the 1st appellant carrying a wooden pole and the 2nd

appellant carrying an iron rod. It was the 3rd and the 4th appellants who have

dragged the deceased along the road. A few minutes after the deceased was

dragged away, the witness has heard a cry ,

which she has clearly identified as that of Jayasena the deceased. She has had

no difficulty in identifying the voice of the deceased as he was also a neighbour

who lived next to her brothers house. The Police who returned about half an

hour later has found the deceased with injuries. The deceased has succumbed

to his injuries at the hospital. PW-03 has specifically stated that the 5th

accused was not there when the attack took place.

This witness has been subjected to lengthy cross examination by the defence,

but has failed to dent the trustworthiness of her testimony, although several

omissions have been brought to the notice of the Court.

The learned High Court judge who heard and observed the demeanor and

deportment of the witness has commented that

.

PW-05 was the daughter of the deceased who has reached the place of the

incident after it happened upon receiving the information provided by the 5th

accused that her father was being assaulted. She has travelled with the

deceased in the Police jeep to the hospital. Although she has given evidence

about a dying declaration by her father about his assailants, the learned High

Court judge has decided not to consider her evidence as legally acceptable with

Page 7 of 14

regard to the dying declaration and has not relied on that evidence for his

judgment.

PW-06 was the Police officer who conducted investigation into the incident. He

has observed the place where the deceased had been assaulted which was a

veranda of a house by the other side of the road from the house of PW-03. He

has also observed damage to the houses of PW-03 and her brother Ariyaratne.

After the arrest of the 2nd appellant, he has recovered the iron rod marked as P-

02 based on the statement made by him. The relevant extract of the statement

which led to the recovery of the iron rod has been marked as P-01 under the

provisions of section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance.

As the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) Dr. D. G. Dissanayaka, who conducted

the postmortem examination of the deceased was not available to give evidence,

it was the then JMO of the Tissamaharama Base Hospital who has given

evidence based on the postmortem report which has been marked as P-03 at

the trial. There had been multiple contusions on either side of the chest and

several abrasions on the body. The JMO has recorded that of the left ribs of the

body, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and the 5th front ribs and 3rd and 4th back ribs fractured,

while the 3rd, 4th, and the 5th front right ribs have also been fractured. The JMO

has opined that the death was due to shock and hemorrhage due to multiple

fractures to the ribs.

When called for a defence at the end of the prosecution case, all the appellants

who were present in Court then, had made dock statements. The 1st appellant

has claimed that he was falsely implicated in the crime because of the enmity

PW-03 had with him due to a love affair he had with her daughter.

The 3rd appellant had claimed that Ariyaratne gave evidence against him due to

a grudge he had with his wifes father and he was not involved in the crime.

Page 8 of 14

The 4th accused has claimed that he came home only at about 9 p.m. on the

day of the incident from Kataragama and he had no involvement of the

incident. In other words, he has taken up a defence of alibi.

The 5th accuseds statement had been that he was never involved in the

incident, but was the one who went and informed the daughter of the deceased

that her father is being assaulted.

With the above facts in mind, I now proceed to consider the grounds of appeal

urged by the learned counsel.

Ground of appeal of the 1st and the 2nd appellants: -

It was the contention of the learned counsel for the appellants that since PW-

03 had an enmity with the 1st appellant, she cannot be regarded as an

independent witness, and hence, it was not safe to act on her evidence alone,

as she was the only eye witness to the incident. It was his submission in view

of the several omissions which has been brought to the notice of the Court her

evidence was unreliable and not credible, which has escaped the mind of the

learned High Court judge.

However, as correctly pointed out by the learned Senior DSG for the

Respondent, the learned High Court judge had been very much alive as to the

issue of credibility of the witness when the evidence of PW-03 was analyzed.

The learned High Court judge has separately considered each of the alleged

omissions to come to a firm finding as to whether they have any relevance to

the credibility of the witness and has determined that they do not go into the

root of the matter and are of no importance.

As considered correctly by the learned High Court judge, in the case of The

Attorney General Vs. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa, S. C. Appeal No-

79/2008 decided on 06-05-2010, S.Tilakawardane, J. referred to the case of

Boghi Bhai Hiraji Bhai Vs. State of Gujarat, AIR 1983 SC 753 which states

thus;

Page 9 of 14

Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect the

trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that the

Court must exercise its judgment on the nature, tenor of the inconsistency

or contradiction and whether they are material to the fact in issue.

Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the basic

version of the witness cannot be given too much importance.

In the instant action, there are no contradictions of the evidence of PW-03.

Although the alleged omissions by PW-03 when she made her statements to the

Police have not been established through the Police witness who recorded the

statement, the learned High Court judge has very correctly considered the said

omissions and reached his conclusions as mentioned above. He has also

correctly drawn his attention to the comment by the learned High Court judge

who had the benefit of listening to the evidence of PW-03 with regard to her

demeanor and deportment, which I find relevant in the context of the

argument.

It is settled law that even when there is only one witness, if the evidence is

credible and trustworthy, a trial Court need not look for corroboration and a

trial court can act upon such evidence.

The relevant section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows;

134. No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required

for the proof of any act.

In the case of Mulluwa Vs. The State of Madhya Predesh 1976 AIR 989 it

was stated that,

Testimony must always be weighed and not counted.

After considering the relevant principles, Jayasuriya,J. in the case of

Sumanasena Vs. Attorney General (1999), 3 SLR, 137 stated thus;

Page 10 of 14

The Court could have acted on the evidence of solitary witness

Nandasena, provided the trial judge was convinced that he was giving

cogent, inspiring and truthful testimony in Court. The learned trial judge

has come to such a favourable finding in favour of witness Nandasena as

regards to his testimonial trustworthiness and credibility.

I do not find any basis to conclude that PW-03 was not an independent witness

as claimed. It is very much clear from her evidence that she has spoken about

what she has seen on that fateful day. She has testified that she rejected the

advances made by the 1st appellant to marry her daughter, but it is abundantly

clear in the way she has given her evidence, she was not a partisan witness. On

the contrary, I find that it may be the very reason for the 1st appellant and

others to attack her house and use foul language on her, although their initial

dispute was with someone else.

The evidence of PW-03 has been corroborated by the evidence of the JMO,

which confirms her evidence as to the injuries sustained by the deceased. The

Police evidence as to the observations of the crime scene are also clearly

corroborative as to the truthfulness and credibility of the evidence of PW-03.

For the reasons as discussed above, I find no basis in the ground of appeal

urged on behalf of the 1st and the 2nd appellant.

Grounds of appeal of the 3rd and the 4th appellants: -

The trial of this case has commenced on 14-03-2012 and the evidence of the

two main witnesses, namely, PW-03 and PW-05 has been concluded. However,

when the case resumed for further trial on 11-06-2012, there had been no legal

representation for the 3rd appellant, which has resulted in the appointment of

an assigned counsel through the state expense on his behalf. It is correct that

the assigned counsel has not been given time to get ready before leading

further evidence on that day, nor has it been requested. However, I find that

this irregularity has not caused any material prejudice to the 3rd appellant,

Page 11 of 14

which amount to a denial of a fair trial. On the above mentioned 11-06-2012,

PW-06 who has visited the scene of the crime and recorded his observations

has given evidence. He was not the Police officer who arrested the 3rd appellant

and or recorded his statement. He has not given any evidence detrimental

towards him. It was only the PW-06 who has given evidence on that day, and

the next trial date had been on 11-07-2012, which had provided sufficient time

for the assigned counsel to get ready for the case.

The next matter urged by the learned counsel for the 3rd and the 4th appellants

was that the learned High Court judge in his judgment has shifted the burden

of proof to the appellants and thereby they have been denied of a fair trial.

The learned counsel relied on the comment made by the learned High Court

judge at page 32 of the judgment (Page 293 of the brief) that;

.

I find it is not a sentence that can be taken in its isolation to argue that the

learned High Court judge has shifted the burden of proof to the appellants. If

one reads the relevant paragraph of the judgment, it becomes clear that the

burden that a prosecution carry in a criminal case has never been shifted as

claimed.

The relevant paragraph reads as follows;

3 1,2,3,4 . . . .

Page 12 of 14

Although the learned High Court judge has used a wrong word

in the above paragraph and the following paragraph as well, the way he has

analyzed the evidence of the prosecution as well as the dock statements clearly

establishes that what has been considered was whether the appellants have

provided a reasonable explanation or has created a reasonable doubt as

against the strong prima facie evidence established by the prosecution. The

learned High Court judge has not imposed any higher burden on the appellants

by the said statement.

The learned High Court judge had been mindful of the protection given to an

accused person by way of presumption of innocence until proven otherwise by

the prosecution, and has considered the evidence in its totality to reach his

findings with clear reasoning, which has not occasioned any prejudice to the

appellants.

The proviso of Article 138 of the Constitution reads as follows;

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

In the case of Mannar Mannan Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1990) 1 SLR

280,

Held: The enacting part of sub-section (1) of section 334 mandates the Court

to allow the appeal where-

(a) The verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having

regard to the evidence; or

(b) There is a wrong decision on any question of law; or

(c) There is a miscarriage of justice on any ground.

Page 13 of 14

The proviso vests discretion in the Court and recourse to it arises only

where the appellant has made out at least one of the grounds postulated

in the enacting part of the sub-section. There is no warrant for the view

that the Court is precluded from applying the proviso in any particular

category of wrong decision or misdirection on questions of law as for

instance, the burden of proof.

There is no hard and fast rule that the proviso is inapplicable where

there is non-direction amounting to misdirection in regard to the burden

of proof. What is important is that each case falls to be decided on the

consideration of

(a) The nature and intent of the non-direction amounting to a

misdirection on the burden of proof

(b) All facts and circumstances of the case, the quality of evidence

adduced and the weight to be attached to it.

In the case of Lafeer Vs. Queen 74 NLR 246, H.N.G.Fernando, C.J. stated;

There was thus both misdirection and non-direction on matters concerning

the standard of proof. Nevertheless, we are of opinion having regard to the

cogent and uncontradicted evidence that a jury properly directed could not

have reasonably returned a more favourable verdict. We therefore affirm

the conviction and sentence and dismiss the appeal.

Both the above mentioned are cases where the trial at the High Court was

before a jury, and decided in appeal under section 334 of the Criminal

Procedure Code, which has similar provisions to Article 138 of the Constitution

in the section itself. I find that the principles discussed in the said appeals are

of equal relevance to a determination of an appeal under the provisions of

section 335 of the Criminal Procedure Code of a trial held without a jury before

a High Court in view of the Proviso to Article 138 of the Constitution.

Page 14 of 14

In the appeal under consideration, there was no misdirection or non-direction

as to the law, but only a choosing of wrong words, which has not caused any

prejudice to the appellants or has not occasioned a failure of justice as

discussed before.

The alibi of the 4th appellant has been well considered by the learned High

Court judge with a clear understanding that it was the duty of the prosecution

to establish that he was one of the participants of the crime in rejecting his

plea of alibi.

There is no reason to accept that there is a discrepancy as to the crime scene

between the evidence of PW-03 and the Police officer who recorded his

observations. According to the evidence, after the initial attack on the

deceased, he had been dragged along the road towards the reservation by the

appellants. PW-03 had heard the cry of the deceased few minutes thereafter.

The Police witness has seen blood like stains in the veranda of a house on the

other side of the road, where he had determined that it was the place of assault

of the deceased. In my view, this observation matches exactly to the evidence

of PW-03 without any doubt. For the reasons stated, I find no merit in the

grounds of appeal of the 3rd and the 4th appellants either.

The appeals are therefore dismissed as they are devoid of merit. The conviction

and the sentence of the appellants affirmed.
