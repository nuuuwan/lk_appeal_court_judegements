MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioner in this application has invoked the supervisory

jurisdiction of this Court under Article 140 of the Constitution

seeking, inter alia, for the following relief:

b) a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the

transfer of the premises bearing Assessment No. 43, 2/2

National Housing to the 3rd Respondent by way of deed of

conveyance bearing No. 17547 dated 02.01.2012 and certified

by Raja Gunaratna, Commissioner of National Housing, and

c) a mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus directing the

1st Respondent to forthwith divest the premises bearing No.

Page 4 of 10

43, 2/2 Gregorys Road, Colombo-7, as per the application

under section 17 (A) (2) dated 03.04.2012 marked A15 hereof,

to the Petitioner.

When the matter was taken up for argument on 27.04.2021, the

learned Counsel for the Petitioner informed Court that the Petitioner

would not peruse the relief as prayed for in paragraph c of the

prayers to the petition, namely the aforesaid mandate in the nature

of a writ of mandamus.

In the circumstances, the only question to be determined in this

application is confined to paragraph b of the prayers to the

petition, namely a writ of certiorari quashing the transfer of the

premises bearing assessment No. 43, 2/2 Gregorys Road, Colombo-

7, from the Commissioner of National Housing to the 3rd Respondent

by way of deed of conveyance bearing No. 17547 dated 02.01.2012.

Factual matrix

The Petitioner was the owner of the premises bearing Assessment

No. 43, 2/2 Gregorys Road, Colombo-7 (hereinafter referred to as

the premises) and the 3rd Respondent was the tenant of the same

when the said premises was vested with the Commissioner of

National Housing on 13.01.1974, who is the 1st Respondent in this

application, in terms of the provisions of the Ceiling on Housing

Property Law No. 1 of 1973, as amended (hereinafter referred to as

the Ceiling on Housing Property Law).

Thereafter, the Petitioner made representation to the Commissioner

for National Housing, and accordingly, on 05.08.1985 the premises

were divested in favour of the Petitioner. Thereupon, the said

divesting order was affirmed by the Ceiling on Housing Property

Board of Review on 14.02.2001. The 3rd Respondent, by way of writ

of certiorari, challenged the foregoing orders of the Commissioner

and the Board of Review in the Court of Appeal (CA. Application No.

Page 5 of 10

418/2001, CA Minutes dated 11.12.2002 - marked as A25). The

Court of Appeal, in its order dated 11.12.2002, has quashed the said

decision to divest the premises to the Petitioner. The Supreme Court,

by order dated 29.01.2009, in case No. S.C. Appeal 52/2003 has

affirmed the aforesaid order of the Court of Appeal. Accordingly, the

1st Respondent became the owner of the premises in suit.

Thereupon, the 1st Respondent, by a deed of conveyance bearing No.

17547 dated 02.01.2012 has transferred the premises in dispute to

the 3rd Respondent. Subsequently, the 3rd Respondent filed an

application in the Court of Appeal bearing No. CA. Writ. 92/2014,

seeking to quash the decisions of the 1st Respondent and the Board

of Review to not to allow the 3rd Respondent to sell and dispose the

premises in question. The Court of Appeal, in its judgment dated

02.12.2016, allowed the said application of the 3rd Respondent and

directed the 1st Respondent to allow the 3rd Respondent to sell and

dispose the premises in suit in terms of section 17 (c) of the Ceiling

on Housing Property Law. Accordingly, the 3rd Respondent, by deed

bearing No. 24 dated 15.06.2017 attested by H.M.H.K. Deshapriya,

Notary Public, conveyed his title to the 4th Respondent.

The dispute raised by the Petitioner

The contention of the Petitioner was that the 3rd Respondent has

failed to insure the premises in question and neglected to pay the

rates and taxes to the same, and thereby, violated the terms and

conditions of the agreement to sell marked A2, entered into by and

between the 1st Respondent and the 3rd Respondent. As such, he

argued that the said deed of conveyance bearing No. 17547 is null

and void in terms of the provisions of the Ceiling on Housing

Property Law.

It is pertinent to be noted that there are contractual obligations

between the 1st Respondent and the 3rd Respondent in accordance

with the agreement to sell marked A2 whereas the Petitioner was not

Page 6 of 10

a party to the same. Moreover, as per the determinations of the Court

of Appeal and the Supreme Court (Supra) the Petitioner has no title

to the premises in dispute. In such a situation, it is the considered

view of this Court that, the Petitioner has no locus standi to question

the contractual obligations of the party concerned of A2 and to

challenge the validity of the deed of transfer bearing No. 17547.

Be that as it may, it is borne out from the letter dated 21.05.2010,

issued by the Colombo Municipal Council marked 3R2 that there is

no any rates due in respect of the premises in suit as at 31.03.2010.

The 3rd Respondent in paragraph 13 of his statements of objection

categorically denied the averments contained in paragraphs 17 and

18 of the Petition wherein it was alleged that the 3rd Respondent

failed to insure the premises and did not pay the rates to the local

authority.

Besides, this Court is mindful of the fact that the 3rd Respondent is

not obliged to pay the rates to the Colombo Municipal Council from

the year of 1985 in which the premises was divested with the

Petitioner till the decision of the Supreme Court on 29.01.2009 in

case No. S.C. Appeal 52/2003 by which the said order was quashed.

The Supreme Court further observed that there is a valid agreement

to sell between the 1st and 3rd Respondents and thereby the 3rd

Respondent had legitimate expectation that the premises in suit be

sold to him.

Furthermore, it is significant to note that the salient question raised

by the Petitioner in this application has already been decided by the

Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.

The Court of Appeal in case No. CA/Writ/92/2014, CA Minutes

dated 11.12.2015, observed as follows:

The Court observes at this stage that the Petitioner-

Respondent (the 3rd Respondent in this application) is the lawful

Page 7 of 10

owner of the premises bearing No. 43 2/2 Gregory Road,

Colombo 7 after the execution of the transfer deed by the 1st

Respondent-Respondent on 02.07.2012

(Vide page 6 of the judgment)

Moreover, the Court of Appeal in the above case has allowed the 3rd

Respondent to sell the premises to the 3rd party as well. In these

circumstances, it is abundantly clear that the Court of has already

recognized the fact that the 3rd Respondent was the owner of the

premises in dispute.

In case No. CA. Application 418/2001 (supra), the Court of Appeal

having quashed the order of the 1st Respondent divesting the

premises in dispute to the Petitioner, observed the fact that the 3rd

Respondent has complied with the terms and conditions of the

Agreement to sell and paid the money to the 1st Respondent to

purchase the premises, which reads thus,

The sale of the premises is further clarified in document

A1whereby he has requested to pay a sum of Rs. 440/- from

16/03/1977 until the Commissioner determines the price and

this condition had been accepted by the Petitioner who had

made payments from March 1977 for a period of 9 years until

the Commissioner had purported to divest the house by A2 on

18/02/1986...

(Vide page 6 of the judgment).

The Supreme Court in case No. SC. Appeal 52/2003 (Supra)

observed that the 3rd Respondent has made the payments to the 1st

Respondent towards the purchase of the premises in dispute

without default as agreed upon the agreement marked A2, until the

aforesaid divesting the premises. Further observed, that the 3rd

Respondent had a legitimate expectation that the said premises will

Page 8 of 10

be sold to him. The said observation of the Supreme Court is

reproduced as follows:

The Commissioner for National Housing in his affidavit dated

4th July 2001 has admitted the receipts marked A3 and A4

without expressly denying the claim that the said payments

were regularly made during the period in question, and the

Appellant in his affidavit dated 25th September 2001 has

responded to the averments by admitting the matter of record

only, whatever he intended to mean by that phraseology. In

the absence, therefore, of any express denial from the Appellant

or the Commissioner of the matters set out in paragraph 8 of the

Respondents affidavit filed in the Court of Appeal, I am inclined

to believe that the Respondent had in fact paid a substantial

sum of money towards the purchase of the house in question.

In these circumstances, it is my opinion that the Respondent

had a legitimate expectation, at the very least, that the house

in question will be sold to him.

In my considered opinion, the equities favor the Respondent

rather than the minor child Pascal, in whose favor house

bearing premises No. 43 2/1, Gregorys Road, Colombo 7 had

already been divested, although an attempt had been made to

paint the picture that the said premises was divested in terms

of Section 17(1) of the Ceiling on Housing Property Law to make

out a case for another house to be divested on account of

Pascal. It is unfortunate that the Commissioner for National

Housing, and his Department, had wittingly or unwittingly

helped the Appellant in this endeavor. To my mind, the

mistakes made by the Commissioner for National Housing in

this case are too many to be disregarded on the basis that they

were made by sheer inadvertence.

Page 9 of 10

I accordingly answer all the questions on which special leave

has been granted by this Court in favor of the Respondent

(Vide page 15-16 of the judgment, SC Minutes of 29.01.2009)

Having considered the totality of the aforesaid judgments of the

Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court it is abundantly clear that

the fact in issue to be determined in this application has already

been decided by the said apex Courts, and therefore, this Court has

no jurisdiction to re-adjudicate the same once again.

It appears to this Court that the Petitioner though merely annexed

the aforesaid judgments of the apex Courts to his petition, made no

reference in the petition as to how these decisions would be relevant

or have a bearing on the present application. Even though, some

observations and determinations of the Court of Appeal and the

Supreme Court in those cases are very material to the instant

application, deliberately the petitioner failed to enunciate those

aspects to this Court in his petition. It shows that the Petitioner has

suppressed material facts in the application, and therefore, he is

estopped from seeking discretionary remedies in the nature of writs

from this Court.

In the case of Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi [1973] 77 NLR

131, it was held that,

When an application for a prerogative writ or an injunction is

made, it is the duty of the petitioner to place before the Court,

before it issues notice in the first instance, a full and truthful

disclosure of all the material facts; the petitioner must act with

uberima fides.

Furthermore, the petitioner in this case is seeking for an order to

cancel the deed bearing No. 17547 on the basis that the 3rd

Respondent has breached the agreement to sell entered into between

Page 10 of 10

the 1st Respondent and the 3rd Respondent. It is trite law that the

jurisdiction pertaining to the breach of contract and cancellation of

deed is vested with the District Court.

Moreover, as Wade and Forsyth observe in their work Administrative

Law (9th Edition, page 668), contractual and commercial obligations

are enforceable by ordinary action and not by judicial review. This

principle is illustrated by many judicial decisions such as

University Council of Vidyodaya University v. Linus Silva [1964]

66 NLR 505 and Jayaweera v. Wijeratne [1985] 2 Sri LR at 413,

which have had the effect of excluding contractual disputes from the

pale of judicial review through prerogative remedies.

In these circumstances, I proceed to dismiss this application without

costs.

Application dismissed.
