The Accused-Appellant in this case was convicted for the murder of Hathurusinghe

Wasantha Chandralal Sathurusinghe and was sentenced to death.

This appeal is against the said conviction and the sentence.

The grounds of appeal preferred by the appellant are as follows;

1. The two items of circumstantial evidence namely

i. The dying declaration made by the deceased ii. Identification of the Accused Appellant about 30 meters away from the place where the deceased was found create a reasonable doubt to the prosecution case and the conclusion reached by the

Learned High Court Judge that the above items of circumstantial evidence has

proved the case beyond reasonable doubt is wrong in law.

2. Identification of the Accused at the identification parade is doubtful.

3. Rejection of the dock statement of the Accused Appellant is wrong in law.

The facts of the case albeit briefly are as follows;

On 30.05.2010 around 01.45 pm when Home Guards PW 01 Abegoda Liyanage

Anura Kumara and PW 02 Katandola Mudiyanselage Pitiye Gedara Mahesh Lakmal were

on duty on the main Negombo-Katunayake Road at Kerege Pokuna Security Point, a

woman travelling towards Colombo in a three wheeler had informed them that a person

was being assaulted in Samagi Mawatha. Both witnesses have walk about 50 meters

towards Negombo when they witnessed 3 people with clubs getting into a green coloured

cab which was stopped near the bus halt. Two people have got in from behind and one

person to the front seat, and the vehicle had made a U turn and had headed towards

3

Negombo. Both witnesses had looked around for about half an hour and not coming

across any injured person , they have returned to their security point.

About half an hour later a Buddhist Monk and a civilian have come and informed

that there was an injured person in the temple premises which was about 150 to 200 meters

from the security point. They have seen a young man with an injury on his head under the

hood of the temple. After checking his Identity Card they have gathered he is from Kegalle.

According to PW 2 Mahesh Lakmal when he questioned the injured person whether

he recognized the person who assaulted him, he had said it was the husband of Nilanthi.(in

page 52 of the brief.)

The above facts are not reflected in the statement to the police although PW 2

testified that he informed the police that the injured told him it was Nilanthis husband who

assaulted him. He has taken part in the identification parade but failed to identify any

person.

4

PW 1 Anura Kumara has testified that he witnessed three people getting in to the

vehicle with clubs in their hands. He had observed the person who got in to the front of the

vehicle with a club and has identified him at the Identification Parade, and later identified

him as the accused in the dock.

PW 1 in page 88 in the brief has testified that the injured has stated that he was

assaulted by the people connected to the girl he was having an affair with.

. .

PW 1 and PW 2 have taken the injured in a three wheeler to the police post at

Mahabage and after filing an entry there, had dispatched the injured in another three

wheeler to the hospital. According to the evidence of PW 1 and PW 2 the injured was able

to speak at that time.

PW 4 Sunil Fernando is the three wheeler driver who admitted the injured to the

hospital. According to him, two Home Guards who were near the Welisara Police post

have asked him to take the injured to the Ragama Hospital. The injured who had been

seated on the ground had come limping and got in to the three wheeler and told him to take

him to the Peliyagoda Police Station to make an entry. When they reached the Peliyagoda

Police Station, the injured had not been in a condition to get off the vehicle and a police

officer who saw him has adviced the witness to take him to the hospital. When he could

not get out of the vehicle in Peliyagoda, the injured had told the three wheeler driver that

it was Nilanthis husband who assaulted him. This witness was not cross examined.

5

The father of the deceased PW 3 has testified that he got to know that his deceased

son was having an affair with one married woman named Nilanthi of Malwatthe Kande,

whom he has seen, but never spoken with, who is the wife of Pradeep of Malwatthe Kande.

He had got to know about the affair three months prior to the incident. It was obvious from

his evidence that he was not aware of the details of the affair, only the fact that the deceased

had some connection with a person called Nilanthi. Neither has he associated with any

member of Nilanthis family except stating he knows Nilanthis mother . He has seen the

accused only after coming to court and had no prior knowledge about him.

PW 7 SI Sarath Wickramaarchchi has testified that the incident has occurred on the

Colombo- Negombo road near the bus stand and that witness statements have been

recorded. However, with the available evidence it is unclear on what information the place

of incident was identified and from which witnesses, whereas even PW 1 and PW 2 who

are alleged to be the first persons who were informed about the incident have not testified

about a definite place of incident. The available evidence does not disclose a place where

the deceased was assaulted. He was found in the temple premises. In these circumstance,

the alleged place of incident has not been established by the prosecution.

Be that as it may, the officer had been asked whether any information was disclosed

regarding Nilanthi, to which question he has answered in the affirmative and has stated

that it transpired that the accused was the husband of Nilanthi. However, it appears that

even the full name of the person called Nilanthi has not been disclosed. Neither has she

been questioned regarding the incident. This police witness has not been cross examined.

From the evidence of PW 11 DIG Randeniya it was disclosed that, when case No

B 725/10, the case pertaining to this incident was called in the Wattala Magistrates Court,

the appellant had surrendered himself to court on that day. It is PW 11s evidence that as

the witnesses who were to be called that day for the inquiry and the members from the

aggrieved party were not present in Court, the application to produce the accused appellant

6

for an Identification Parade was allowed by the learned Magistrate. In his Dock Statement,

the appellant has stated he was in the Cell inside Courts for about one and a half hours

before the Identification Parade was conducted. (Page 201 of the Brief)

PW 09 Dr Edirisinghe the JMO, has testified explaining that the Glasgow Coma

Scale (GCS) was at 15 which means up to the time of death that the deceased was in a

position to speak coherently. As documented, he has been admitted to hospital at 3.45 pm

and had died at 4.20 pm. The doctor has observed 8 injuries on the head, face, near the

eyes, left arm, left shoulder, on the chest, and the left thigh. It is in evidence that all the

injuries observed has been caused by blunt force and that there had been internal bleeding

and the cause of death is given as hemorrhage and shock due to the rupture of the spleen.

This witness too has not been cross examined.

In the dock statement of the accused he has denied his involvement in the incident

and has stated that as his name was mentioned regarding the incident he surrendered to

Court. He has also stated that another suspect who was previously taken in to custody on

suspicion had been released.

The learned trial judge in her judgment has accepted the dying declaration made by

the deceased to the three independent sources as believable and that the prosecution has

established that it was Nilanthis husband who was responsible for the assault. The

identification of the accused by PW 1 also has been considered in favour of the prosecution

case. The dock statement has been rejected after consideration and in page 10 of the

judgment it is stated as follows;

.

At the hearing of the appeal, the Counsel for the accused-appellant submitted that

the prosecution has not established beyond reasonable doubt, that the person referred to as

Nilanthi by the deceased, is the wife of the appellant.

It is trite law that the burden is always on the prosecution to prove the case against

the accused appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

One of the main issues for consideration is the identification of Nilanthi, referred to

by the deceased.

It is apparent that the witnesses who gave evidence of the dying declaration did not

know any of the parties personally. That is the deceased, Nilanthi or the accused appellant.

They have without any reservation testified what they were told by the deceased who is a

stranger to them. No evidence has surfaced that they are partisan witnesses.

The evidence of the police officer PW 7 in pages 144 and 145 of the brief is that

from his investigation he was satisfied that the accused is the husband of Nilanthi to whom

the deceased had referred. But there is no cogent evidence submitted by the prosecution

to establish that fact.

8

The evidence in the above pages is as follows.

..................

:

It is abundantly clear that the evidence above does not establish that the person

referred to as Nilanthi by the deceased is the wife of the accused.

The evidence of the father of the deceased PW 3 is that he knew that the son was

having an affair with a girl called Nilanthi from Malwattakanda. He was not aware when

the affair started. He has never spoken with her but has seen her. No evidence is divulged

how and when or how many times he has seen her, Nilanthi was never identified in Court.

The accused was also a stranger to him. He has seen the accused only after coming to Court.

His evidence was that he had heard that the accused was the husband of Nilanthi with

whom his son was having an affair. It stand to reason that if PW 3 saw the accused only

after coming to Courts, and if Nilanthi was not present in Court, his knowledge that

Nilanthi and the accused were husband and wife has to come from a third party. That

information has not been divulged. Is this evidence sufficient to establish the identity of

Nilanthi and her connection to the accused?

On perusal of the evidence adduced in the instant case, it is abundantly clear that

there has been no attempt by the prosecution to establish with cogent evidence that the

9

person named Nilanthi that the deceased was referring to is in fact, the wife of the accused

and no one else.

Therefore, it is abundantly clear that the prosecution has not identified or established

with cogent evidence, the person named Nilanthi who was having an affair with the

deceased. Merely stating that the deceased was having an affair with Nilanthi does not

establish that it is the same person who is married to the accused. Careful perusal of the

evidence adduced reveals that there is absolutely no evidence to establish the nexus

between Nilanthi referred to by the deceased and Nilanthi the wife of the accused.

Therefore, I am of the view that there is no evidence established beyond reasonable doubt

that the person called Nilanthi the deceased has been referring to, has any connection to

the accused in this case.

In Queen vs Sumanasena 66 NLR 351 it was held that;

. suspicious circumstances do not establish guilt nor does the proof of

any number of suspicious circumstances relieve the prosecution of its

burden of proving the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt

and compel the accused to give or call evidence.

In Iyamperumel Ashokumar Vs. The Attorney General (2010 III ACJ 15) (CA

167/07) decided on 23.08.2010, their Lordships held that it is trite law that suspicious

circumstances, even if it amounts to a large number, do not establish guilt. Nor does the

proof of any number of suspicious circumstances relive the prosecution of its burden of

proving the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.

It appears that the learned trial judge inferred that the reference to Nilanthi as

stated in the dying declaration referred to the wife of the accused, without any cogent or

substantial evidence.

10

The witnesses to the dying declaration were unaware of the existence of a person

called Nilanthi with whom the deceased had a relationship. It is my considered opinion

that merely mentioning that the person who assaulted was Nilanthis husband does not

suffice to justify an inference that it was the accused who assaulted the deceased.

As there is no conclusive proof that Nilanthi who was referred to by the deceased is

the wife of the accused I hesitate to agree with the conclusion of the trial judge. Therefore,

I am of the view that it is not safe to act on the dying declaration made to three witnesses,

to come to a finding that the person called Nilanthi referred to by the deceased, is the wife

of the accused, when that fact has not been established beyond reasonable doubt.

Another issue to be considered is, whether there was a positive identification of the

accused appellant as the person who inflicted the injuries to the deceased. The indictment

refers to the accused and two others who are unknown to the prosecution. Only PW 1 had

identified the accused as one of the 3 people who were with clubs. PW 2 who was with PW

1 at the same place was unable to identify the accused, the reason being the distance that

he saw the three people. It can be presumed that the eye sight of people may vary from

person to person.

However, considering the background to the holding of the Identification Parade,

that is the appellant being in open court and thereafter, in the cell for over one and half

hours, on an inquiry date where it is safe to assume that interested parties to the case may

be present in Court. The only evidence is Police witness stating that the witnesses and

other interested parties were not present in Court when the appellant surrendered himself

to Court. That day being a day the case was scheduled to be called the non availability of

the witnesses has not been established by the prosecution. Therefore, in the absence of any

material evidence of this factual position, I am cautious to rely on the identification by PW

1 of the accused at the Identification Parade.

11

The case against the appellant is dependent on circumstantial evidence. Therefore

it is necessary to consider whether the items of circumstantial evidence presented by the

prosecution justify an inference of guilt against the accused.

In Queen vs Kularatne 71 NLR at page 534 The Court of Criminal appeal quoted with approval what Watermeyer, J held in Rex vs Blom.

Two cardinal rules which govern the case of circumstantial evidence in a criminal trial,

1. The inference sought to be drawn must be consistent with

all the proved facts. If it does not, then the inference cannot be drawn. 2. The proved facts should be such that they exclude every

reasonable inference from them, save the one to be drawn. If they had not excluded the other reasonable inferences, then there must be a doubt whether the inference sought to be drawn is correct.

In Don Sonny V Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 1, Court has held that the following

principles should apply in considering a case presented on circumstantial evidence;

1. When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence, the proved

items of circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point

towards the only inference that the accused committed the offence.

On a consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can be arrived at

should be consistent with the guilt of the accused only.

2. If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence if an inference can

be drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, then one cannot

say that the charges have been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

12

3. If, upon a consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence, the only

inference that can be drawn is that the accused committed the offence then they

can be found guilty.

4. The prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused had the

opportunity of committing the offence, the accused can be found guilty only and

only if the proved items of circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt

and inconsistent with their innocence.

Justice Sisira de Abrew in R.M Amarasiri Vs The Republic of Sri Lanka

CA Appeal 107/2005 decided on 26.11.2009 has held that In a case of circumstantial

evidence, if two decisions are possible from the proved facts, then the decision which is

favourable to the accused must be taken.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the Respondent has referred

to this court several judicial decisions in support of his contention that the testimonial

trustworthiness of witnesses is a matter for a trial judge and a considered finding of a trial

judge will not be disturbed by an Appellate Court lightly.(King Vs, Gunaratne 14 Ceylon

Law Recorder 174,Fradd Vs Brown & Company 20 NLR 282 at 283, State of Uttar Pradesh

Kalansuriya alias Raja Vs Republic of Sri Lanka CA 28/2009 (13.02.2013)

The Counsel has also referred to the following judicial authorities basing his

argument that the evidence given on material points were not challenged as some of the

prosecution witnesses were not cross examined , and accordingly it has to be concluded

that the evidence that was not disputed is accepted. (B.R.R.A. Jagath Premawansa V.

Attorney General CA Appeal No. 173/2005 decided on 19.03.2009, Sarwan Singh V. State

of Punjab 2002 AIR Supreme Court(iii) 3652 at 3655 and 3656 ,Bobby Mathew V, State

In the Solicitor General v Nadarajah Muthurajah 79 (1) NLR 63 it was held:

that an appellate court has the power to review at large the evidence upon

which the order of acquittal was founded and to reverse that decision having

given due weight to the opinion of the trial judge. A court is justified in

interfering with the lower courts decision where there is no question of the

credibility of witnesses, but the sole question is the proper inference to be

drawn from specific fact.

From the conclusion of the learned trial judge, it is abundantly clear that she has

erroneously decided that it had been established by the prosecution, that Nilanthi referred

to by the deceased is the wife of the accused-appellant and has accepted the dying

declaration made to the three witnesses on that assumption.

As stated above, it is our considered opinion that it will be dangerous and unsafe to

agree with the conclusion of the trial judge to convict the accused-appellant for murder,

when there is a doubt about the identity of Nilanthi referred to by the deceased.

Having considered the evidence presented by the prosecution and the relevant

judicial authorities cited above that pertains to circumstantial evidence, we are of the

considered view that the trial Court has erroneously found the accused-appellant guilty of

the murder of Hathurusinghe Wasantha Chandralal Sathurusinghe.

Accordingly, allowing the appeal, we set aside the conviction and sentence imposed

on the accused appellant and acquit him from the charge of murder.
