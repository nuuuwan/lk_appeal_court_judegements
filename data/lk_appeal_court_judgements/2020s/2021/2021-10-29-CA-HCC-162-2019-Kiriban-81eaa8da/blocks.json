Counsel contended that therefore, the section 27 recovery is false and should not be relied upon. Learned Senior DSG for the respondent submitted that although there is an issue on the date of arrest, recovery of the body of the deceased in terms of section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance could be taken into consideration. 8.

(page 179 of the brief). However, the carpenter Weeraratne Bandara (PW3) who testified on behalf of the prosecution said that when he was arrested by the police in the evening by 4pm, the appellant was also in the police vehicle. He has not clearly said the exact date he was arrested; however, his evidence was that he was detained at the police station for two days until the body of the deceased child was found. Appellant had also been at the police station. Therefore, it is clear that the police have arrested the appellant not on the 8th of June as testified by police officers, but at least two days prior to the 9th when the body of the child was found.",

PW6 had heard a child calling, and upon inquiry the appellant had told him that it was his granddaughter.
