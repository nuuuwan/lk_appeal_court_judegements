SUSPECT RESPONDENT

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to revise the order of the learned

High Court Judge of panadura dated 07.07.2020.

When a party files a revision application the party filling the same must satisfy this

court that there is an exceptional circumstance which shocks the conscious of court.

Under the provision of the Criminal Procedure Code Act nu 15 of 1979 section 364 it

has been set out what should be considered in a revision application. They are

1) Legality of any order, 2) Propriety of any sentence or order 3) Regularity of the proceedings The above has been discussed in Attorney General vs. Ranasinghe and others

1993 (2) SLR 81.

In the instant matter the suspect had been taken in to custody while riding a motor

bike with another lady for being in possession of heroin on 13 .9. 2018. The other lady

who was on the pillion of the motor bicycle was also taken in to custody for being in

possession of heroin. The Government Analyst had identified the amount of heroin

taken from the custody of the suspect of this petition to be less than 2 grams, the

heroin taken in to custody from the suspect pillion rider also had been identified to

be less than two grams.

The contention of the petitioner is that although the Government Analyst Report had

been received the indictment had not been filed and the learned High Court Judge

had referred to the amount of heroin as being 7 grams. Upon perusal of the initial B

report filed the parcels of heroin had been taken in to custody from the custody of

the suspects separately and not individual parcels. Therefore making a reference by

the learned High Court Judge as to the heroin being 7 grams is not factually correct.

According to the submissions of the respondents the indictment has been dispatched

to the High Court but the petitioner pleads ignorance.

Nevertheless according to the act under which the suspect had been taken in to

custody that is the, Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act, for a suspect to be

enlarged on bail there has to be exceptional reasons. This is analyzed in the following

case, that is

Labynidarage Nishanthi V. Attorney General [CA (PHC) APN 48/2014], It was held

that,

..It is trite law that any accused or suspect having charged under the above act will

be admitted to bail only in terms of section 83 (1) of the said Act and it is only on

exceptional circumstances. Nevertheless it is intensely relevant to note, the term

exceptional circumstances has not been explained or defined in any of the Statutes.

Judges are given a wide discretion in deciding in what creates circumstances which is

exceptional in nature.

There are plethora of cases in the legal parlor which had identified what creates an

exceptional circumstances in relation to granting bail

In view of the submissions made before us at the time of the impugned order the

learned High Court Judge had been in possession of the Government Analyst report

but he has failed to consider the pure quantity of heroin which was identified from

the custody of the suspect pertaining to this case. He has infact considered the full

amount of heroin taken from the custody of both suspects and another suspect who

was arrested on the same day but produced under a separate B report.

Therefore this court is of the opinion that the instant application for revision should

be allowed and the suspect should be enlarged on bail on the following conditions,

1) Cash bail of Rs 100000/,

2) Two sureties to the value of Rs 50000/ each,

3) The suspect should report to the relevant police station on every Sunday of the

month.

The registrar of this court is directed to convey this order to the relevant High

Court.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
