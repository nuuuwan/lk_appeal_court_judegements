Judgment

The Officer in Charge of the Police Station of Ratnapura, filed an information in terms of

Section 66 (1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, on the 23rd of May 1994 against the 1st, 2nd,

and the 3rd Respondents with regard to the possession of the shop premises namely THE NEW

HOME NEEDS. Since the actual dispute was between the 1st Respondent and the 2nd Respondent,

the 3rd Respondent had been released from the proceedings.

However, after the inquiry, the learned Judge of the Primary Court held in favour of the party of

the 1st part Respondent [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Respondent] and delivered the

Order on 27th December 1996.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the party of the 2nd Respondent-Petitioner invoked the

Revisionary Jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Ratnapura to revise or set aside the said

Page 4 of 25

Order. Apparently, the Learned High Court Judge by Order dated 6th November 2000 dismissed

the Application of the Petitioner, affirming the Order of the Learned Primary Court Judge.

Consequently, the party of the 2nd part Petitioner-Appellant [hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Appellant] made an Application bearing No. CA (PHC) APN 77/2000 to the Court of Appeal

challenging the said Orders of the High Court as well as the Primary Court. It appears that the

Court of Appeal set aside the impugned Order of the Learned High Court, since it is a nullity,

because no reasons were assigned to the conclusion reached by the High Court Judge and thus

directed the Registrar to send the Case forthwith to the relevant High Court to make an Order on

the merits of the Case.

Consequently, the learned High Court Judge made an Order dated 15th October 2015, once more

dismissing the Application of the Appellant. Subsequently, the Appellant has preferred this Appeal

against the said Order of the High Court.

The Appellant alleged that the said Order, once more failed to give proper consideration to the

merits of the Case and to adduce proper reasons thereto, and is therefore, contrary to the express

direction given by the Court of Appeal by its Order dated 19th November 2008.

It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that the learned High Court Judge, in the course of his

Order stated that upon the documentary proof available, the premises in dispute was in the

Respondents control (Constructive Possession) during the period in question.

Page 5 of 25

The learned Judge of the High Court appears to have relied upon the Police investigation reports

dated 18th August 1993 and 21st August 1993 in coming to this conclusion. In this respect, it was

further submitted that there is no evidence of such Constructive Possession in favour of the

Respondent during the material time and in any event that the said investigation reports of 18th

August 1993 cannot be relied upon in determining the impugned application filed on or around

23.05.1994.

In these circumstances, the learned High Court Judge has concluded that the Respondents

uninterrupted possession to the premises in dispute had been proved by the facts revealed during

the inquiry in the Primary Court as an erroneous finding. Which fails to take cognizance of the fact

that at the time of filing the information in Court, it was the Appellant who was in possession and

not the Respondent.

In fact, this is the position taken even by the Respondent and also the keys to the premises had

been obtained from the Appellant by the Fiscal acting on an Order of Court.

In such circumstances, the Appellant had taken up the position that no Order could have been made

in favour of the Respondent pursuant to Section 68(1) and 68(2) of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act.

Moreover, it was submitted that on the other hand, to make an Order in terms of Section 68(3) in

favour of the Respondent, there has to be a clear finding by the learned Judge of the Primary Court

that the said Respondent had been forcibly dispossessed within a period of two months

Page 6 of 25

immediately before the date on which the information was filed under Section 66 of the Act. Since

the Learned Judge of the Primary Court as well as the learned Judge of the High Court has not

come to any such finding in the circumstances, no Order could have been made in favour of the

Respondent even under and in terms of Section 68(3) of the Act.

In this instance, the Court wishes to peruse the Affidavits and the documents submitted before the

learned Primary Court Judge.

According to the Affidavit filed by the Appellant dated 18.07.1994 inter alia that the Appellant

took over the property in question in the year 1980 from a member of the Local Authority namely

Mr. Leo Peiris in view of the receipt marked and produced as Z 1.

In or around 1985 the Appellant had given the said property to the Respondent to carry on a

Grocery Shop and in or around 1987 the Appellant had invested Rs. 40, 000/- in the business on

the agreement based on profit sharing.

Nevertheless, the Respondents position was that he purchased the premises in dispute from the

Appellant for Rs. 30, 000/- in 1986 and constructed a building. Thereafter he carried on a

Partnership business with one Yusoof and the said Partnership business was terminated consequent

to the settlement entered in Case bearing No. 100/M in the District Court of Ratnapura.

Subsequently, he carried on a business with one Hemana Manthri in the said premises.

However, it was admitted by the Appellant in his Affidavit that the Respondent carried on a

grocery shop at the said premises from 1987-1993 June.

Page 7 of 25

In 1993, the Electricity supply and the Water supply to the said premises were disconnected due

to the non-payment of bills. Therefore the shop was closed and the business was discontinued from

June 1993.

The Respondent stated that since the Electricity Bills were incorrect he was delayed in settling the

Electricity Bills, until he got the correct bills as they were in the name of the Appellant.

Consequently, the Respondent sought to transfer the Electricity connection to his name instead of

the Appellant, but the Electricity Board did not accede to the request of the Respondent. Further

the Respondent averred in his Affidavit to the Primary Court, it was revealed that the Electricity

supply was disconnected due to a request made by the Appellant.

The said position was substantiated by the Respondent by producing the documents marked as 3,

4, 10, 11 and 12. It was submitted by the Appellant that during the time the shop was closed,

the Appellant had observed on a certain day, the padlocks put to the premises had been broken.

Accordingly, when the Appellant inquired that from the Respondent, he had indicated that he had

no knowledge of the same. Therefore, having discussed the matter with the Respondent, the

Appellant took over possession of the premises after giving the Respondent some goods such as,

two refrigerators, a deep freezer and some items as his share.

On the contrary, the Respondent had affirmed in his Affidavit that due to the disconnection of the

Electricity supply, the shop premises was closed with groceries. On 18.08.1993, he observed that

the padlocks placed by him to the entrance door of the premises were removed and the padlocks

Page 8 of 25

were changed somebody. Therefore the Respondent had complained to the Ratnapura Police

Station on the same day regarding a suspicious housebreaking. On this complaint, the Respondent

has complained that there was a reasonable suspicion that those padlocks were changed by

Premalal, the Appellant. The said complaint dated 18.08.1993 is on page 323 of the Brief and the

observation notes made by the Police Officer and the statement made by the Appellant are on pages

325 and 326 of the Brief.

According to the observation notes, the shop premises was broke opened by the Police and the

Respondent had stated that there was no shortage of Groceries.

Appellant admitted in his statement that it was he who padlocked the premises.

The Appellant has taken up the position in his Affidavit that he was occupying the shop premises

from or around 23.09.1993 and there was no objection from the Respondent for occupying the

premises. In support of the said proposition the Appellant produced, marked as 22, a Complaint

made to the Grama Niladhari in this regard and the said Grama Niladhari was called to adduce

evidence.

It is worthy to draw the attention to the statement made to the Police by the Appellant on

18.08.1993.

. . .

It is noteworthy, the averments contained in the Affidavit of the Appellant dated 18.07.1994

produced before the Primary Court in this respect,

, ...

22 .

The attention of Court was drawn to the Counter Affidavit of the Respondent dated 05.09.1994

tendered to the instant Primary Court Case.

It was the contention of the Appellant that from 1994, the Appellant started using the premises for

the purpose of storing empty bottles of aerated water and soft drinks pertaining to a result of the

agency that he was carrying out. The Grama Niladhari report was produced in proof thereof.

The Respondent states in Paragraph 6 of the Affidavit that,

However, the Electrical Superintendent of the Ratnapura Municipal Council adduced evidence and

said in Cross-Examination that 22 . 94.05.27

. According to the evidence of the said Witness, Premaratne the Appellant has

paid Rs. 10, 000/- out of the arrears of the Electricity Bills of Rs. 24, 337/- on 27.06.1994. It is to

be noted that this date is after the filing of the information.

According to the document 7 (Payment for Electricity) dated 11.03.1994, L.H.P Rajapakse the

Respondent has paid Rs. 2000/- in receipt bearing No. 51357 on behalf of H. Premaratne, the

Appellant.

The said Witness, Electrical Superintendent said in evidence which is that at P.172 of the brief.

: ? ?.

: 1994.03.11 / 136

The said document / 136 dated 11.03.1994 was marked and produced as 5, which was an

Order made under the Electricity Act.

It states that,

. 11.03.1994 .

4.... 48

.

It was revealed in Evidence of the said Witness, that on the same day that is on 11.03.1994 the

Respondent paid Rs. 2000 /- as part payment of the arrears of the Electricity Bills by 7 and has

Page 11 of 25

entered into a contract with the Electricity Board. Subsequently, the Electricity supply was given

on 21.03.1994.

It is to be noted that the Appellant has paid Rs. 10, 000/- on 27.05.1994 by 22 and the Respondent

entered into a contract with the Electricity Board on 11.03.1994. Since the information was filed

on 23.05.1994 the Appellant has paid Rs. 10, 000/- in view of the Electricity bills after the filing

of the information.

It is pertinent to note that since the information was filed on 23.05.1994, the Respondent had

entered into a contract with the Electricity Board and paid Rs. 2000/- as part of the arrears on

11.03.1994 and had got the Electricity Supply on 21.03.1994, thus it appears that the Respondent

got the Electricity Supply prior to the filing of the information. Nevertheless, the Appellant has

paid Rs. 10, 000/- as part payment of the Electricity bills on 27.05.1994 just after filing of

information.

In view of the said position, a serious doubt is created in accepting the contents of the Affidavit of

the Appellant and the letter (22) by the Grama Niladhari.

As such, the pertinent question that has to be determined under Section 66 of the Primary Court

Procedure Act, is whether the Respondent was dispossessed by the Appellant or whether the

possession was handed over to the Appellant amicably by the Respondent. Apparently, in terms

of Section 68(3) of the said Act, Court has to determine who was in possession of the premises in

dispute two months prior to the date of filing the information.

Page 12 of 25

On this premise, Court wishes to draw attention to the evidence adduced at the inquiry and the

Documentary Evidence placed before Court by both parties.

The Witness, Matara Bandarage Samarapura [Linesman], adduced Evidence at the inquiry and

said that on the instructions of the Electrical Superintendent, the said Witness reconnected the

Electricity Supply to the premises in question somewhere in March 1994. Since the premises was

closed, the Witness had to go to the Respondents residence to get him down to open the shop

premises to reconnect the power supply.

It is interesting to note the Evidence of the Appellants Witness, Grama Niladhari, Alabodawatte

Lekamlage Sarath.

In his Evidence, it was produced a letter [6] dated 02.07.1993 issued to the Respondent by the

said Witness, Counter Signed by the Divisional Secretary stating that . . .

1/20 1/13 (The New

Home Needs) .

The said letter 6 confirmed the possession of the Respondent with regard to the premises in

dispute until 02.07.1993.

In contrast, the said Witness issued another letter [23] dated 03.06.1994 addressed to the

Divisional Secretary, Ratnapura which states that,

Page 13 of 25

28/2, .

1994 (, , )

.

It is to be noted that the said letter 23 was not Counter Signed by the Divisional Secretary as

indicated in the said letter [6] issued to the Respondent. Thus the authenticity of 23 is

impeachable.

Apparently, the said letter 23 was obtained on 03.06.1994, after filing of the information in the

instant Case and it is obvious that letter 23 was obtained to get an advantage for the purpose of

this Case. Thus, it is doubtful that the Appellant started a business of storing empty bottles of Coca-

Cola, Sprite and Fanta at the disputed premises since March 1994. As such, the possession of the

Appellant to the disputed premises on the date of filing of the information does not seem to be

established by the said letter 23 of the Grama Niladhari.

The Court draws attention to the document produced & marked as 24 which is an Application

dated 05.03.1994 for a Business License. The said Application was signed by the Municipal

Commissioner on 31.05.1994 and the letter was issued to the Appellant on 02.06.1994, after the

institution of the instant case.

The said Witness, Grama Niladhari, was Cross Examined by the Counsel for the Respondent in

this respect as follows,

.

. .

. . .

According to the aforesaid Evidence, Witness has not specified whether he saw the bottles being

unloaded from the Lorry to the shop premises in the month of April or in May. Further, the Witness

has not stated that he saw the Appellant there at the time of unloading bottles. As such, the Court

cannot come to a definite conclusion whether the bottles were unloaded by and on behalf of the

Appellant or whether the bottles were unloaded in the month of May after the filing of the

information on the 23rd of May. However, the said evidence was vague and not corroborated by

the Appellant through any other independent evidence. Thus, the said evidence cannot be accepted

in favour of the Appellant to decide this matter in terms of Section 68(1) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act.

Furthermore, the said Witness was questioned on the complaint made by the Respondent regarding

the break open of the shop premises.

Page 15 of 25

In view of the aforesaid Evidence of the Grama Niladhari, it is observable that either he was

deliberately lying to Court by suppressing that he was unaware of breaking open of the shop

premises in question, or the Appellant has suppressed the dispute regarding the shop premises

taken place on the 21.05.1994, when he was obtaining the said letter 23 from the Grama Niladhari.

However, it is clear that the said Grama Niladhari had issued the letter 23 without inquiring into

the request made by the Appellant.

The Court draws the attention to the complaint made by the Respondent on 21.05.1994 to the

Police Station, Ratnapura. It states,

Apparently, the Respondent had made another complaint regarding the same incident to the

Ratnapura Police Station on the following day. The attention of Court was drawn to the complaint

dated 22.05.1994.

The complaint of the Respondent was inquired by the Ratnapura Police and statements were

recorded from the Appellant and one Dharme [Galhena Arachchilage Dharmasena]. The Police

made observations of the shop premises and made Observation Notes and Inventory of the

Groceries in the shop premises.

It is worthy to note the statement made by the Appellant [Haththalage Premaratne],

Accordingly, Ratnapura Police had recorded the statement of the said Dharme [Galhena

Arachchilage Dharmasena]. The statement made by Dharmasena on 22.05.1994 to the Police

Station Ratnapura states as follows,

.

. 21.05.1994 .

.

. .

.

It is significant to note that, the statement of the said Dharmasena, contradicts the statement of the

Appellant.

The Appellant [Premartne] said that

.

Apparently, the said Dharmasena denied that he was occupying the said disputed shop premises.

Although the Police filed the information making the Appellant, Respondent and the said

Dharmasena as parties before the Primary Court Case, later he was discharged from the

Proceedings.

The Appellant in his statement mentioned another brother namely Chandrasena, but no statement

was recorded from him. Since he did not come forward in these proceedings, it is difficult to

believe the version of the Appellant, indicated in his statement to the Police.

Page 19 of 25

Furthermore, it is apparent that the Appellant had not substantiated the contents of the said

statement made to the Ratnapura Police on 22.05.1994 thus, Court is not inclined to accept the

evidence of the Appellant in this regard and it has to be disregarded.

It has to be observed that the Affidavit tendered by the Appellant to the learned Primary Court

Judge dated 18.07.1994 is entirely based on the statements made to the Ratnapura Police by the

Appellant.

According to Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Affidavit of the Appellant which stated that as a

compromise to the dispute with the Respondent he gave him two refrigerators, a deep freezer and

some other goods in lieu of the business and took possession of the premises and started occupying

the same from 23.09.1993 onwards.

In this respect, it is submitted that the Appellant had not proved these facts by any Documentary

or cogent Evidence.

The rest of the averments in the said Affidavit of the Appellant pertains to the Coca-Cola Agency

carried on at the premises in dispute from 23.09.1993. In support of this contention, the Appellant

has submitted the documents 24, 25 and 26.

The said document 24 is an Application made on 05.03.1994 by the Appellant to obtain a Business

License for the year 1994. According to 24 it was approved by the PHI on 31.05.1994 and

countersigned by the Municipal Commissioner Ratnapura on 02.06.1994.

Page 20 of 25

The said document 24 appears to be in a printed form, but just a photocopy was tendered and not

a certified copy. The Application was made on 05.03.1994 and the Public Health Inspector

approved it on 31.05.1994 and after the signature of the Municipal Commissioner, the date

indicates as 02.06.1994.

Therefore, it is significant to note that the Appellant got the approval to use the premises in dispute

as a storage for empty bottles after filing the information in the Primary Court Case. Since 24 is

a photocopy and not certified by the relevant authorities, and also since no evidence has been

adduced on the said document by the relevant authorities, the Learned Primary Court Judge, very

correctly held that the document 24 is not proved by the Appellant.

25 and 26 are the documents obtained from a lorry owner/ driver to substantiate that from

February 1994 empty bottles were transported to the Kaduwela soft drinks manufacturing

company and loaded drink bottles were transported to the premises in dispute.

Apparently, 25 and 26 are photocopies of the letters. The Court observed that 25 and 26 are

neither Affidavits nor the Appellant submitted the receipts pertaining to the payments made in

view of the Lorry hires, to substantiate the said position. Since there is no evidentiary value on

those documents, the Learned Primary Court Judge disregarded those and correctly held that those

documents were not proved.

It is relevant to note that the Appellant stated in Paragraph 15 of the said Affidavit that,

15. 31.05.1994

.

Page 21 of 25

Therefore, it is worthy to draw attention to the Fiscal report dated 31.05.1994 which is filed on

Page 304 of the Brief.

There are 336 Grocery items in the inventory. It is relevant to note items No. 334 and 335.

334. , , 8400

.

335. .

According to the statement made by the Appellant on 22.05.1994, the Appellant stated that,

25.09.1993 .

.

In view of the aforesaid statement, the 8400 empty bottles and cases referred to in item No.334

above belong to the Appellant. As such, it is clear that the day (31.05.1994) inventory was prepared

by the Court Officer, the possession of the disputed premises was with the Appellant.

Nevertheless, the Investigating Officer of the Ratnapura Police Station P.C 16760 Nimalsiri

inspected the premises in dispute on 22.05.1994 and made observations that,

.

, , , 25

.

, .

.

Page 22 of 25

According to the said investigation notes, the Officer observed expired and perished groceries at

the shop. Since there were cobwebs, it appeared that the premises was closed for some time and

no one had occupied the same until 22.05.1994.

As such, it is hard to believe that the Appellant had been carrying out a business at the said premises

during the period of 29.09.1993 to 22.05.1994.

On the other hand, according to the said observation notes, the Investigating Officer had observed

that there were only 25 cases of Fanta, Coca-Cola, Sprite and Pepsi bottles. If one case contains

24 bottles, then 25 cases would be 600 bottles. Thus therein no indication of 8400 bottles.

When the premises was inspected on 22.05.1994 on this day there were only approximately 600

bottles, nevertheless, on 31.05.1994 there were 8400 bottles more. Thus it is apparent that those

8400 bottles were stored after the inspection on 22.05.1994.

The court draws the attention to the complaint made on 22.05.1994 by the Respondent which states

that,

. .

.

Page 23 of 25

In view of the said contents of the complaint of the Respondent, since the Appellant broke opened

the padlocks and changed the same, it clearly shows that even after the inspection on 22.05.1994

the keys of the padlocks were with the Appellant thus the Appellant had the opportunity of storing

8400 bottles during the period of 22.05.1994 to 31.05.1994. Hence, the Appellant had not

established that he was in possession of the shop premises from 29.09.1993 to 21.05.1994.

Therefore, the Court can come to a reasonable conclusion that until 21.05.1994, the possession of

the shop premises was with the Respondent and his possession was interrupted by the Appellant

on 21.05.1994.

It is worthy to note that the 1st Respondent had sought in his Affidavit for an Order of restoration

of Possession to place him in possession of the corpus on the footing that he was forcibly

dispossessed.

It appears that the 1st Respondent had sought relief in terms of section 68(3) of the Primary Court

Procedure Act. In such a situation there has to be a specific finding to the effect that the 1st

Respondent had been forcibly dispossessed or evicted from the corpus within a period of 2 months

immediately before the date in which the information was filed under Section 66 of the Act.

However, the learned Primary Court Judge made an Order that the 1st Respondent is entitled to

Possession of the disputed premises and further ordered the Appellant or his agents and/or servants

not to disturb such Possession of the 1st Respondent.

Page 24 of 25

Apparently, the learned Primary Court Judge has made an Order that the 1st Respondent was

entitled to Possession of the disputed land on the assumption that the 1st Respondent was in

constructive possession of the corpus on the date of filing of the information under Section 66 of

the Primary Court Procedure Act and further Ordered the Appellant or his servants and/or agents

not to disturb the Possession of the 1st Respondent.

It is noteworthy that, the learned Judge had come to the conclusion that the 1st Respondent had

been in constructive possession of the disputed premises on the date of filing of the information,

on the assumption that the 1st Respondents grocery items are in the premises on the relevant date

and also the learned Primary Court Judge held that the Appellant had not been proved that he had

been in Possession of the disputed premises during the period of 29.09.1993 to 21.05.1994.

Nevertheless, it is evident that the Appellant had forcibly removed the padlocks placed by the 1st

Respondent and had changed the padlocks, which can be construed as dispossession of the 1st

Respondent by the Appellant from the disputed premises. The keys to the disputed premises had

been obtained from the Appellant by the fiscal on 29.05.1994 by an Order of Court, which clearly

demonstrates that the 1st Respondent was dispossessed by the Appellant from the premises in

dispute on 21.05.1994.

Since it was established by the 1st Respondent that he had been in Possession of the disputed

premises, since 18.08.1993 until the dispute arose on 21.05.1994, thus the Respondents possession

cannot be disturbed such wise. Therefore, the learned Primary Court Judge is under a statutory

Page 25 of 25

duty to consider and grant relief to the 1st Respondent by restoration of his Possession to the

disputed premises under see 68(3) of the Act.

In view of the foregoing reasons, it clearly manifests that although the 1st Respondent was

dispossessed by the Appellant on 21.05.1994, the Appellant had not substantiated his possession

to the premises in dispute during the period of 29.09.1993 to 21.05.1994. Thus, the Appellant had

failed to prove that he was in possession of the premises in question two months prior to the date

of filing of the information under Section 66(1) of the Primary Court Procedure Act on 23.05.1994.

Hence, the Order made by the learned Primary Court Judge on 27.12.1996, which determined that

the 1st Respondent was entitled to the Possession of the premises is well-founded. Thus, we see no

reason for us to interfere with the said Order of the learned Primary Court Judge, as well as the

Order of the Learned High Court Judge dated 15.10.2015.

As such, we affirm the said Orders of the learned Primary Court Judge and the learned

High Court Judge and Dismiss the Appeal with cost fixed at Rs. 50,000/-.

I agree.
