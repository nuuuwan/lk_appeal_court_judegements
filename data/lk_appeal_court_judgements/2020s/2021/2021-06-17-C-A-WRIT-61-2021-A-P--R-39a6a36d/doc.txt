Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA The issue in this application relates to the failure on the part of the Petitioner, the

Chairman of the Seruwila Pradeshiya Sabha to have the budget of the said

Pradeshiya Sabha for the year 2021 passed by the members of the said Pradeshiya

Sabha (i.e. the 7th 20th Respondents) and the consequences that should flow from

such failure.

The Pradeshiya Sabha Act (the Act) has been enacted to provide for the

establishment of Pradeshiya Sabhas with a view to provide greater opportunities for

the people to participate effectively in the decision-making process relating to

administrative and development activities at a local level. In terms of Section 2(1) of

the Act, the Minister may, with a view to facilitating the effective participation of the

people in local government and development functions, by Order published in the

Gazette declare any area to be a Pradeshiya Sabha area for the purposes of the Act.

Section 3 provides that, the Pradeshiya Sabha constituted for each Pradeshiya

Sabha area shall be the local authority within such area and be charged with the

regulation, control and administration of all matters relating to public health, public

utility services and public thoroughfares and generally with the protection and

promotion of the comfort, convenience and welfare of the people and all amenities

within such area. It is observed that in addition to the above, the relevant

Pradeshiya Sabhas are responsible for the maintenance of public drains, waterways,

public fairs, local markets, lighting of streets and public places etc. Thus, a Pradeshiya

Sabha plays a very important role in the day to day lives of our people.

Members are elected by the people to the Pradeshiya Sabha every five years, with an

expectation that the members so elected would address the day to day issues of the

ward in an expeditious and efficient manner. However, not only should the elected

representatives of the people be efficient, they should ensure good governance at all

times and maintain strict financial discipline in respect of the funds of the local

authority and refrain from any abuse of power.

I shall at the outset consider the four provisions of the Act, which are particularly

relevant to the issue that has arisen for the determination of this Court, namely

Sections 14, 168, 169 and the proviso to Section 169.

4

I shall commence with Section 168, in terms of which:

(1) The Chairman of every Pradeshiya Sabha shall each year on or before such

date and in such form as may be specified by rules, prepare and submit to

the Pradeshiya Sabha, a budget for the next succeeding year, and

containing an estimate of the available income and details of the proposed

expenditure for the ensuing year.

(2) Every Pradeshiya Sabha shall finally consider and adopt the budget

together with the amendments, if any, before the commencement of the

year to which such budget relates.

(3) The Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha may at any time prepare a

supplementary budget and lay it before the Pradeshiya Sabha

(4) The Pradeshiya Sabha may pass, modify or reject all or any of the items in

any budget or supplementary budget or add any item thereto.

The necessity for a Pradeshiya Sabha to have a budget for each year and the

obligation of the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha to take responsibility for the

preparation of the budget in terms of the law and thereafter submit the said budget

to the Pradeshiya Sabha for the Sabha to finally consider, pass and adopt the budget

is clearly established by Section 168.

The ability of the Pradeshiya Sabha to carry out its statutory functions in the

following year is intrinsically linked to having a budget duly passed by the members

of the Pradeshiya Sabha, and demonstrates the ability of the Chairman to command

the confidence of the majority of the Pradeshiya Sabha and have the necessary

finances to attend to the day to day operations and the vital developmental activities

of the Pradeshiya Sabha.

The next provision that is relevant to this application is Section 169 which reads as

follows:

5

If the Pradeshiya Sabha modifies or rejects all or any of the items in any or

supplementary budget or adds any item thereto and the Chairman does not

agree with any such decision of the Pradeshiya Sabha he shall re-submit the

budget or supplementary budget to the Pradeshiya Sabha for further

consideration. Where a budget or supplementary budget is not passed by the

Pradeshiya Sabha within two weeks after it is re-submitted, such budget or

supplementary budget shall, notwithstanding that it has not been passed by the

Pradeshiya Sabha, be deemed to be the duly adopted budget or supplementary

budget of the Pradeshiya Sabha.

The effect of Section 169 is that by operation of law, the budget submitted by the

Chairman shall be considered as the duly adopted budget of a Pradeshiya Sabha,

even though the said budget has not been passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha and

therefore does not have the support of the majority of the members of the

Pradeshiya Sabha. The law therefore has provided a concession to a Chairman of a

Pradeshiya Sabha to function for a period of two years, notwithstanding that he may

not have the support of the majority of the Pradeshiya Sabha to pass the budget. It

must be kept in mind that notwithstanding the above deeming provision, the

obligation placed on the Chairman by Section 168 to submit the budget to the

Pradeshiya Sabha must still be complied with, and that the concession under Section

169 extends only to a Chairman who submits a budget to the Pradeshiya Sabha and

permits the members to vote on the said budget.

I say this for the reason that in terms of Section 14 of the Act:

(1) All matters or questions authorized by this Act or by any other written law

to be decided by a Pradeshiya Sabha shall be decided upon by the

majority of members present at any meeting of the Pradeshiya Sabha held

in accordance with the provisions of this Act

(2) Where the votes of the members present at any meeting are equally

divided in regard to any question, the Chairman, Vice-Chairman or other

member presiding at the meeting shall, in addition to his vote as a

member, have a casting vote.

6

Thus, wherever the Act refers to a decision of the Pradeshiya Sabha or requires a

decision to be taken by the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha, it is imperative that

such decision is taken by way of a vote of the members present at a general or

special meeting of the Pradeshiya Sabha. This position is clearly reflected in Section

169 of the Act which requires a decision of the Pradeshiya Sabha upon the

submission of the budget and upon re-submission.

Section 169 was amended by Section 17 of the Local Authorities (Special Provisions)

Act No. 21 of 2012 by the insertion of the following proviso:

Provided that, if the Council according to sections 168 and 169 of this Act

modifies or rejects all or any items in any budget or supplementary budget or

adds any item thereto which was submitted to the Council at any time by the

Chairman after a period of two years since the commencement of the term of

office of the Council, and

if the Chairman does not agree to such decision of the Council,

he shall resubmit the said budget to the Council for further consideration.

Where a budget or supplementary budget is not passed by the Council within

two weeks after it is resubmitted for the second time,

the Chairman shall be deemed to have resigned from the office of Chairman at

the end of the said period of two weeks.

Thus, with the introduction of the proviso in 2012, the concession provided to a

Chairman by Section 169 to continue in office notwithstanding his inability to have

the budget passed by a majority of the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha has been

limited to the first two years of office. After the first two years, it is not only

imperative that the budget is submitted to the Pradeshiya Sabha, it is also imperative

that the budget is passed by a majority decision. The law has provided a Chairman

with two opportunities to do so. The difference between the first two years and the

period thereafter is that, in the latter period, if the Chairman fails to submit and have

7

the budget passed at least at the second opportunity, the Chairman shall be deemed

to have resigned from his office.

In my view, Section 169 and the proviso contemplates two decisions of the

Pradeshiya Sabha which attracts the provisions of Section 14 and therefore requires

a vote by the Pradeshiya Sabha. The first is the decision of the Pradeshiya Sabha to

modify, add or reject the budget. The acceptance of a modification and/or an

addition, or the rejection of the budget as a whole, should be by way of a majority

vote of the Pradeshiya Sabha. The second is the decision of the Pradeshiya Sabha

whether to pass the budget that has been re-submitted by the Chairman, which too

must be taken by a vote of the members present at the meeting.

The above provisions can be summarised as follows:

a) The obligation of preparing the budget is with the Chairman vide Section 168;

b) The obligation of submitting the budget to the Pradeshiya Sabha is with the

Chairman vide Section 168;

c) The obligation of placing it before the Pradeshiya Sabha to have it passed by the

members of the Pradeshiya Sabha is at all times with the Chairman vide

Section 169;

d) The budget must be passed by the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha;

e) In the first two years however, even if the budget is not passed, by operation of

law, the budget submitted by the Chairman is the duly adopted budget of the

Pradeshiya Sabha vide Section 169;

f) After the first two years, the Chairman must have the budget passed by the

Pradeshiya Sabha, for which he has been provided two opportunities vide the

proviso to Section 169;

g) After the first two years, the failure on the part of the Chairman to have the

budget passed on either of the two occasions afforded to him would attract the

8

consequences set out in the proviso to Section 169 i.e. the Chairman is

deemed to have resigned from office.

I shall now consider the facts of this application.

The Petitioner states that he was elected a member of the Seruwila Pradeshiya

Sabha as a candidate from the United National Party, together with 15 others at the

Local Government elections held in February 2018. He states that no single party

received a majority. The Petitioner, together with the support of those members

elected from different political parties to that of the Petitioner had secured 10 votes

and been elected as the Chairman.

The Petitioner states that he received eight proposals in response to a request made

by him for all members of the Sabha to submit their suggestions for the budget for

the year 2021. The Petitioner states further that he afforded all members an

opportunity of making any recommendations relating to the budget at the meetings

of the Sabha held on 16th September 2020 and 21st October 2020. The Petitioner

claims that he incorporated all proposals that he had received and submitted a copy

of the proposed draft budget to all members on 17th November 2020.

The Petitioner states that he submitted the draft budget to the Sabha at its meeting

held on 25th November 2020, and that the matters contained therein were discussed

amongst the members. It is borne out by the minutes of the meeting marked P10

that the Petitioner had agreed to incorporate the amendments that were proposed

by the members. What transpired thereafter is relevant to the issue that has arisen

in this application and is therefore re-produced below:1

Thus, even though the Petitioner has submitted the budget on 25th November 2020,

it is clear from P10 that the Petitioner has not taken a vote on the budget presented

by him and instead declared that the budget has been passed by the Pradeshiya

Sabha. The Petitioner has thereby denied the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha, the

opportunity of deciding on the budget by majority vote, as required by Sections 14

and 169 of the Act.

The refusal of the Petitioner to act in terms of Section 169 and its proviso had

triggered a series of correspondence between the Petitioner and the 3rd 5th

Respondents. I shall refer to these in brief as it explains the actions of the 1st 5th

Respondents.

By letter dated 27th November 2020 marked P12 the 4th Respondent, the

Commissioner of Local Government, Eastern Province had informed the Secretary of

10

the Pradeshiya Sabha that he has received complaints that the Petitioner, together

with the Secretary has acted in an arbitrary manner and declared the budget as

having been passed without taking a vote. By his reply marked P12a, the Secretary

had admitted that a vote was not taken.

The 4th Respondent by his letter dated 10th December 2020 marked P13 had once

again drawn the attention of all local authorities in the Eastern Province to the

requirement of having the budget passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha, and the

consequence of not having the budget passed i.e. the Chairman shall be deemed to

have resigned from his post.

The position of the Petitioner is contained in a letter dated 21st December 2020

marked P14, where the Petitioner had informed the 4th Respondent that it is

doubtful if a vote is required where he has agreed with the amendments proposed

by the members. It is clear from P14 as well as from the minutes P10 that the

Petitioner feared that the budget would be defeated if a vote was taken and hence

his decision to refrain from taking a vote.

As the Petitioner had declined to act in terms of P13, the 4th Respondent had

repeatedly requested the Petitioner to have the budget approved by the Pradeshiya

Sabha by 31st December 2020 vide letters dated 22nd December 2020 and 28th

December 2020, marked P15 and P17, respectively. These requests too had been

ignored by the Petitioner.

By letter dated 1st January 2021 marked P18a the 5th Respondent,2 the Assistant

Commissioner of Local Government, Eastern Province had informed the Petitioner

that he cannot incur any capital expenditure as there is no valid budget for 2021

arising from the failure on the part of the Petitioner to have the budget passed by

the Pradeshiya Sabha. By letters dated 6th January 2021 and 8th January 2021 marked

P19 and P20 respectively, the Petitioner had been directed to refrain from carrying

out the functions of the office of Chairman of the Seruwila Pradeshiya Sabha.

By an Order made in terms of Section 185(3) of the Act and published in

Extraordinary Gazette No. 2209/73 dated 8th January 2021, the 1st Respondent, the 2 P18a is the Sinhala translation of P18.

11

Governor of the Eastern Province had suspended the Petitioner from office. This

Order had however been revoked by a further Order published in Extraordinary

Gazette No. 2212/21 dated 27th January 2021.

The 1st Respondent had thereafter issued the following notice marked P23:3

The Chairman of Seruwila Pradeshiya Sabha within the Province of the East has

submitted and failed to get adopted the Budget of the year 2021, as the power

vested in him under Section 168 and 169 of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No. 15 of

1987, thus the said Chairman of the said Pradeshiya Sabha , as provided under

Section 17 of the Local Authorities (Special Provisions) Act, No. 21 of 2012, is

deemed to have been resigned from the office of the Chairman effective from

31.12.2020 and that the office of the Chairman of that Pradeshiya Sabha

become vacant effective from that date.

P23 has been followed by a notice marked P244 issued by the 4th Respondent in

terms of Section 66G of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance, informing that a

meeting of the Seruwila Pradeshiya Sabha will be held on 10th February 2021 to elect

a Chairman to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of the Petitioner.

Aggrieved by the above decisions of the 1st, 4th and 5th Respondents, the Petitioner

filed this application seeking inter alia Writs of Certiorari to quash the decisions in

P18, P18a, P19, P23 and P24.

Although this matter was fixed for support for 9th February 2021, this Court was not

able to take up this matter for support as the Respondents were absent and

unrepresented on that date. However, in order to prevent this application from

being rendered nugatory, this Court, by an order delivered on 10th February 2021,

directed the 1st, 4th and 5th Respondents to refrain from taking any steps in terms of

Section 66G of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance until this Court hears all

parties.

3 This notice, which has been published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 2212/23 dated 27th January 2021 has been issued in terms of Section 223 of the Act. 4 P24 has been published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 2212/55 dated 29th January 2021.

12

It is clear that P18, P18a, P19, P23 and P24 have been issued due to the failure

on the part of the Petitioner to have the budget passed by the members of the

Seruwila Pradeshiya Sabha. In considering the legality of the decisions contained

therein, the primary issue that must be considered is whether the budget of the 1st

Respondent has been passed in terms of the law, and if not, whether the Petitioner is

deemed to have resigned from the office of Chairman as provided for by the proviso

to Section 169 of the Act.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner placed four arguments before this

Court.

The first argument was that the Petitioner had agreed to all the amendments

proposed by the members and that in such a situation, all what is required is for the

budget of the Pradeshiya Sabha to be adopted by the Pradeshiya Sabha as opposed

to being passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha. It was submitted that there is a distinct

difference between the meaning of the words, adopt and pass in as much as

adopt means to consent to and/or accept as a matter of course and pass is to

sanction by the requisite majority. In support of his argument, the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner has referred to the provisions of:

a) Section 168(2) of the Act in terms of which every Pradeshiya Sabha shall finally

consider and adopt the budget;

b) Section 169 of the Act, which provides that the budget shall be deemed to be

the duly adopted budget during the first two years notwithstanding that the

budget has not been passed.

There is no dispute that the Petitioner submitted the budget to the Pradeshiya

Sabha. It is equally clear that the Petitioner did not provide the members of the

Sabha an opportunity to vote on the budget after the members very clearly stated

that they would defeat the budget. Therefore, there is a failure on the part of the

Petitioner to have all matters or questions authorized by the Act to be decided by a

vote, as required by Section 14. Thus, even if the argument of the Petitioner is

accepted that a vote is not required and that the members can adopt the budget

without passing it, such a situation will apply only where all members have agreed to

13

the budget, without a division. That is not the case here and thus, on a best case

scenario, the first argument of the Petitioner has no merit.

Furthermore, the said argument runs contrary to the provisions of the Act. I have

already referred to the fact that the cumulative effect of Sections 168 and 169 is that

the obligation to prepare the budget, submit the budget to the Pradeshiya Sabha and

have the budget passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha is with the Chairman. This is an

obligation that rests with the Chairman right throughout his period of office and is

constant. Nowhere in the law does it allow the Chairman to make a unilateral

decision on the budget. Section 14 of the Act specifies that a decision of the

Pradeshiya Sabha shall be by a vote. Therefore, in my view, nothing short of a vote

would be sufficient to pass the budget, whether it be in the first two years or in the

next two years.

This is clearly recognized in Section 169 for the first two years, by the use of the

words decision and passed, as well as in the next two years by the use of the said

words in the proviso to Section 169. The fact that a budget is deemed to be the duly

adopted budget is a legal fiction introduced to allow the Chairman to continue in

office in the first two years notwithstanding that he has not been able to get the

budget passed. This application is within the proviso to Section 169 where no such

deeming provision is available to assist the Petitioner. In my view, the Petitioner

must either have the budget passed by a vote of the Pradeshiya Sabha or he must

face the consequence of being deemed to have resigned from office.

I am the view that the Petitioner agreeing to any modifications or additions that may

be proposed by one or more or even all members does not suffice in order to claim

that the budget has been passed or to claim that the budget has been adopted. The

claim that the Petitioner agreed with the modifications and amendments and

therefore the budget has been adopted is a red herring. The budget must be passed

by a majority vote if the Petitioner wishes to avoid the deemed resignation being

triggered.

The crux of the matter is that the Petitioner must ensure that he has in place a

budget duly passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha by the due date. If he fails in this regard

at whatever point of the process set out in the proviso to Section 169, he is deemed

14

to have resigned from the office of Chairman by operation of law. A Chairman who

does not take a vote cannot be in a better position than a Chairman who has re-

submitted the budget and taken a vote, only to have the budget defeated by the

Pradeshiya Sabha.

I shall now consider whether the Petitioner has complied with the several obligations

cast on a Chairman by the Act with regard to the budget. The first obligation is to

prepare the budget, which the Petitioner has complied with. The second is to submit

the budget to the Pradeshiya Sabha, which too the Petitioner has complied with. The

third obligation is to have the budget so submitted, passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha.

As I have noted, after some members informed the Sabha that they would not vote

in favour of the budget, the Petitioner refrained from putting the budget to a vote.

Although the Petitioner had been repeatedly directed by the 4th and 5th Respondents

to take a vote on the budget, he refrained from doing so and thereby has failed to

have the budget passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha.

The result is twofold. The first is that the Seruwila Pradeshiya Sabha does not have a

budget for 2021 which has been passed by its members. The second is that there is a

vacancy in the office of Chairman. This in my view is what was intended by the

legislature when it introduced the proviso to Section 169 in 2012. As submitted by

the learned Senior State Counsel for the 1st Respondent, the learned Presidents

Counsel for the 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 15th, 19th and 20th Respondents and the learned

Counsel for the 7th and 11th Respondents, the Petitioner has thrown all democratic

norms out of the window and adopted a procedure not known to the law. I am

therefore unable to agree with the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for

the Petitioner that the budget has been adopted by the Pradeshiya Sabha.

This brings me to the second argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner, which is that the impugned notice P23 is ultra vires the powers

conferred on the 1st Respondent by Section 223 of the Act and Section 2 of the

Provincial Councils (Consequential Provisions) Act No. 12 of 1989. To my mind, the

series of events that followed the refusal by the Petitioner to place the re-submitted

budget to a vote and have it passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha reflects the desperation

on the part of the Respondents to ensure that the provisions of Section 169 are

complied with. Even if the argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is

15

accepted, nothing flows from P23 for the reason that P23 is only an intimation of a

factual position that prevailed as at that date.

The necessity for this Court to consider the third argument of the learned Presidents

Counsel for the Petitioner that the Order P24 issued on 29th January 2021 is not in

conformity with the provisions of Section 66G does not arise in view of the

conclusion that I have reached that there exists a vacancy in the office of Chairman.

Furthermore, the requirement that the next Chairman must be elected within six

weeks of the vacancy is only directory as Section 66G does not contain any sanctions

for not proceeding with the election within the said time period.

The final argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner was that the

1st Respondent cannot remove the Petitioner from office in terms of Section 185 of

the Act due to the failure to adopt the budget. The necessity to consider the said

argument does not arise as P21 has been revoked.

In the above circumstances, I see no legal basis to issue formal notice of this

application on the Respondents. This application is accordingly dismissed, without

costs.
