Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

The Petitioner states that he was elected to the Embilipitiya Urban Council in 2011.

He had initially been appointed as the Vice-Chairman of the Council, and in April

2015 had been appointed as the Chairman, which post he held until the dissolution

of the Council on 31st July 2015. The Petitioner states that he successfully contested

the Kalagediara ward of the Embilipitiya Urban Council from the Sri Lanka Podujana

Peramuna at the Local Government elections held in February 2018. The Petitioner

was declared elected as a member of the Embilipitiya Urban Council in March 20181

and thereafter declared appointed as the Chairman of the Council.2

The Petitioner states that during his tenure as Chairman of the Embilipitiya Urban

Council, he had introduced several projects to uplift and develop the effective

management of the Council as well as the Province. The Petitioner also states that he

had maintained good financial discipline and even managed to pass each annual

budget from the time he started serving the Council as its Chairman, including the

1Vide Gazette No. 2061/42-9 dated 9th March 2018 marked P2. 2Vide Gazette No. 2064/5 dated 26th March 2018 marked P3.

budget for 2021, despite the many challenges faced by the Council due to the Covid-

19 pandemic.

The Petitioner states that despite the above, the 1st Respondent, the Governor of the

Sabaragamuwa Province, acting in terms of the powers vested in him under Section

184(1A) of the Urban Councils Ordinance, as amended (the Ordinance) read with

Section 2 of the Provincial Councils (Consequential Provisions) Act No. 12 of 1989

(the Act) had published a notice in Extraordinary Gazette No. 2210/50 dated 15th

January 2021, marked P8, appointing the 5th Respondent, a retired Judge of the

High Court to conduct an inquiry whether the Petitioner has contravened the

provisions of Section 184(1) of the Ordinance and submit his report within three

months.

The 1st Respondent, exercising the powers vested in him under the provisions of

Section 184(1B) of the Ordinance, read with Section 2 of the Act, has made a further

Order suspending the Petitioner from the post of Chairman with immediate effect,

and appointed the 6th Respondent, Vice Chairman of the Embilipitiya Urban Council,

to perform the duties and functions of the Chairman during the period of suspension

of the Chairman. The said Order too has been published in the aforementioned

Extraordinary Gazette, marked P8.

The Petitioner states that he subsequently received a charge sheet dated 15th

January 2021, marked P10, containing eight charges which was to be inquired into

by the 5th Respondent.

The charges contained in P10 can be summarized as follows:

1. The Petitioner has failed to utilize CCTV facilities obtained on or about 28th

August 2018 for a sum of Rs. 1,430,000 for the purpose for which they were

procured, thereby violating the provisions of Section 184(1)(d) of the

Ordinance.

2. The Petitioner, having participated in the procurement process relating to the

procurement of the said CCTV cameras, had thereafter functioned as the

4

Chairman of the Price Evaluation Committee thereby acting in violation of the

provisions of Section 184(1)(d) and (e) of the Ordinance.

3. The Petitioner had failed to appoint a Technical Evaluation Committee prior to

calling for quotations for the said CCTV system, and thereby failed to carry out a

proper technical assessment relating thereto. The Petitioner has therefore

violated the provisions of Section 184(1)(d).

4. The Petitioner has failed to ensure that the CCTV system is installed in the

specified locations, thereby violating the provisions of Section 184(1)(c).

5. The Petitioner has signed an agreement to obtain security services from 1st

December 2020 30th November 2021 without obtaining the prior sanction of

the 7th Respondent Council, thereby acting in violation of Sections 39 and

184(1)(e).

6. The Petitioner has presented a proposal at a Council meeting on 12th March

2020 to allow photocopies to be taken at Rs. 4 each in the Embilipitiya Public

Library without following the procedure laid down for the presentation of such

proposals, thereby violating the provisions of Section 184(1)(d).

7. The Petitioner has failed to follow the due procedure by permitting a proposal

to be taken up for the vote before it was seconded.

8. Even though an official vehicle had been assigned to him, the Petitioner had

used a vehicle of the 7th Respondent Council (32-4180) in the month of July

2020.

Aggrieved by the decision of the 1st Respondent in P8 to suspend him as Chairman

and appoint an Inquiry Officer and the issuance of the Charge Sheet P10, the

Petitioner filed this application on 25th January 2021. By an amended petition dated

15th February 2021, the Petitioner has sought inter alia the following relief:

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision in P8 to suspend the Petitioner from

the office of Chairman;

5

(b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision in P8 to appoint the 5th Respondent

to conduct an inquiry against the Petitioner;

(c) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the charge sheet P10;

(d) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st 7th Respondents from taking any

further steps pursuant to P8;

(e) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the 6th Respondent from exercising any powers

and performing any duties of the Chairman of the 7th Respondent Urban

Council.

In considering the above relief, I shall bear in mind the judgment of Lord Diplock in

Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case)3

where he identified 'illegality', 'irrationality' and 'procedural impropriety' as the three

heads upon which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review.

The principal argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner is that

there is no basis to present any charges against him, and that the charges set out in

P10 do not warrant an inquiry being held and/or the Petitioner being suspended

from the Office of Chairman. Prior to considering the above argument, I would like to

briefly consider the provisions of the Ordinance under which the 1st Respondent has

acted.

The Ordinance contains detailed provisions which empower the Minister entrusted

with the subject of local government to inter alia remove a Chairman of an Urban

Council. In terms of Section 184(1) of the Ordinance:

If at any time the Minister is satisfied that there is sufficient proof of-

(a) persistent refusal to hold or attend meetings or to vote or to transact

business at any meetings that may be held; or

(b) wilful neglect, or misconduct in the performance of the duties imposed by

this Ordinance; or

31985 AC 374.

6

(c) persistent disobedience to or disregard of the directions, instructions or

recommendations of the Minister, or the Commissioner; or

(d) incompetence and mismanagement; or

(e) abuse of the powers conferred by this Ordinance,

on the part of the Chairman or on the part of any Urban Council or any of the

members thereof, the Minister may, as the circumstances of each case may

require, by Order published in the Gazette -

(i) remove the Chairman from office; or

(ii) remove all or any of the members from office of the Council from office,

and the provisions of section 12 (3) shall thereupon apply; or

(iii) dissolve the Council;

and such Order shall as soon as may be convenient be laid before Parliament.

The power of the Minister to act in terms of Section 184(1) is subject to the condition

set out in Section 184(1A), which reads as follows:

The Minister shall before making an Order under subsection (1), appoint for

the purpose of satisfying himself in regard to any of the matters referred to in

subsection (1), a retired judicial officer to inquire into and report upon such

matter within a period of three months, and such officer shall in relation to such

inquiry have the powers of a Commission of Inquiry appointed under the

Commissions of Inquiry Act.

I must note at this stage that in terms of Section 184(1B)(a)(i) of the Ordinance,

When the Minister appoints a retired judicial officer under subsection (1A) to

inquire into any matter, the Minister may as the circumstances of each case

may require by Order published in the Gazette, suspend the Chairman from

office and direct the Vice-Chairman or, where the office of Vice-Chairman is

7

vacant, or where the Vice-Chairman has been suspended, the Assistant

Commissioner of Local Government of the region to exercise the powers and

perform the duties of the Chairman.

Section 2(1)(a) of the Act provides as follows:

Where any power or function is conferred on or assigned to a Minister or to a

public officer, as the case may be, by any written law made prior to November

14, 1987 on any matter set out in List I of the Ninth Schedule, such power or

function may,

(a) if such power or function is conferred on, or assigned to, a Minister, be

exercised or discharged, in relation to a Province and unless the context

otherwise requires, by the Governor of that Province or the Minister of the

Board of Ministers of that Province to whom the subject has been

assigned; and accordingly, references in every such written law to a

Minister shall be deemed to include references to a Governor of a Province

or the Minister of the Board of Ministers of such Province to whom the

function has been assigned;....

Thus, in terms of Section 2(1)(a) of the Act, the powers vested in the Minister in

terms of Section 184(1), (1A) and (1B) of the Ordinance can be exercised by the

Governor. The 1st Respondent therefore:

(1) Has the power and authority under Section 184(1A) of the Ordinance to appoint

the 5th Respondent, a retired Judge of the High Court, to inquire and report

within three months, whether the Petitioner has contravened the provisions of

Section 184(1) of the Ordinance;

(2) Has the power under Section 184(1B)(a)(i) of the Ordinance to suspend the

Petitioner from holding the office of Chairman of the 7thRespondent, and

appoint the 6th Respondent to act as Chairman in the interim period.

Therefore, what remains to be considered is whether the 1st Respondent acted

irrationally or unreasonably in initiating an inquiry and in suspending the Petitioner

from the office of Chairman.

8

Having identified the three grounds on which judicial review would lie, Lord Diplock

went onto state as follows:4

By 'irrationality' I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as 'Wednesbury

unreasonableness. 5 It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its

defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who

had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it. "

There is however growing precedence to show that English Courts have attempted to

reduce the rigour of Wednesbury unreasonableness over the years. The case of

Secretary of State for Education and Science v Tameside Metropolitan Borough

Council,6 decided prior to the GCHQ case provides for what can be considered a

more balanced test:

In public law, unreasonable as descriptive of the way in which a public

authority has purported to exercise a discretion vested in it by statute has

become a term of legal art. To fall within this expression it must be conduct

which no sensible authority acting with due appreciation of its responsibilities

would have decided to adopt.

It has been held that the standard adopted in Tameside appears to be more realistic,

and balanced.7 I would therefore apply the less rigorous test laid down in Tameside

in deciding the reasonableness of the two decisions before me, for the reason that

what is at stake in this application is the office of an elected representative of the

people. The decision to appoint an inquiry officer and the decision to suspend the

Petitioner must not only be reasonable but is a decision that should be arrived at

carefully, for the reason that such a decision may involve hardship and cast a slur on

the good name of the Petitioner.

As held in Yatawara vs Sarath Ekanayake and Others,8 local government bodies

play an extremely important role in the day to day affairs of the people and to

deprive the people of their duly elected Chairman without any legal basis affects the

smooth administration of the pradeshiya sabha and the quality of the services

provided to the people. While it is absolutely important that prompt and effective

action is taken against any mismanagement or abuse of power by a Chairman or

member of a local authority, it is equally important that the checks and balances that

have been laid down by the legislature should be strictly adhered to.

I shall now consider the argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner that there is no basis to present any charges against the Petitioner. The

learned Additional Solicitor General for the 1st - 3rd Respondents submitted that

starting from July 2019, there have been several complaints and allegations made

against the Petitioner in relation to the manner in which the affairs of the 7th

Respondent Urban Council were being conducted and managed by the Petitioner. He

submitted that by a letter dated 9th July 2019 marked 1R4, a group of seven

Councillors had complained to the Assistant Commissioner of Local Government of

several matters involving fraud, misappropriation and financial mismanagement in

the 7th Respondent Urban Council under the leadership of the Petitioner.

It is admitted by the Petitioner that by letter dated 2nd August 2019, marked P20

under the title wens,smsgsh k.r iNdfjs md,k lghq;= nso jegSu, the then Commissioner

of Local Government, Sabaragamuwa Province had informed the Petitioner that the

affairs of the Urban Council must be conducted in terms of the law and that the

Petitioner was put on notice as far back as August 2019 that steps may have to be

taken in terms of Section 184 of the Ordinance.

It is further admitted by the Petitioner that a meeting was held on 21st August 2019

with the participation of the Petitioner, the then Governor of the Sabaragamuwa

Province, officials of the Department of Local Government of the Sabaragamuwa

Province and members of the Council to discuss issues, complaints and shortcomings

in relation to the administration and management of the 7th Respondent Urban

Council. The proceedings of the said meeting marked 1R3 provides a general

discussion on the management and administration of the 7th Respondent under the

leadership of the Petitioner, including the following:

Several recommendations had been made at the said meeting relating to the

improvement of the administration of the Urban Council, in order to ensure that the

Petitioner complied with the provisions of the Ordinance. In addition, the

predecessor of the 1st Respondent had stated that action will be taken in the future

depending on the outcome of the investigations that would be conducted.9

Pursuant to an investigation carried out, the then Commissioner of Local

Government had submitted to the then Governor a report dated 9th October 2019

marked 1R4(a), whereby the attention of the Governor had been drawn to several

conclusions adverse to the Petitioner. The Commissioner of Local Government had

thereafter requested that the Governor advise the Petitioner to manage the affairs

of the Urban Council properly.10

A preliminary investigation into the affairs of the Urban Council and the Petitioner

had been conducted by a three member committee. The report of the Committee

dated 13th May 2020, marked 1R5 sets out in detail the procedure followed by the

Petitioner with regard to the procurement of the CCTV system and the many

irregularities said to have been committed by the Petitioner in relation thereto. The

recommendation of that Committee had been that steps should be taken against the

Petitioner in terms of Section 184 of the Ordinance.

11

The learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that another Committee of three

members was appointed to inquire into the selection of a service provider for

Security Services for the Urban Council. The report of the said Committee dated 4th

January 2021 marked 1R9 reveal several irregularities relating to the selection of a

service provider for the period 2018/19, 2019/20 and 2020/21. What is critical is the

manner in which the Petitioner had proceeded to award the contract for a sum of Rs.

5.2 million on 25th November 2020 without obtaining the prior approval of the

Council or the Commissioner, which is contrary to the provisions of Section 39 of the

Ordinance.11 What aggravates the situation is the fact that the Council had refused to

approve the awarding of the said Contract, when the Petitioner presented the said

matter before the Council.

It was submitted by the learned Additional Solicitor General that the charge sheet

P10 is reflective of the willful neglect and misconduct in the performance of the

Petitioners duties as Chairman. It was submitted further that the Petitioners conduct

demonstrates a lack of transparency in decision making, which is demonstrated by

the manner in which the Petitioner functioned as a member of both the Technical

Evaluation Committee and the Procurement Committee.

It is in the above factual background that the learned Additional Solicitor General

invited this Court to consider the submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel for

the Petitioner relating to the charges in P10, the holding of an inquiry and the

suspension of the Petitioner.

It is the position of the Petitioner that the above documents that have been

produced by the 1st and 3rd Respondents do not relate to inquiries that were

conducted in relation to the charges contained in P10. However, a perusal of the

said documents shows that the matters pertaining to the CCTV system and the

procurement of Security Services which form part of the charges in P10 have been

the subject matter of the said inquiries.

11 Section 39 reads as follows: (1) The Chairman shall not enter into any contract on behalf of the Council for any work or service the cost of which exceeds five hundred rupees, or any contract enduring for a longer period than the time elapsing between the making of such contract and the end of the financial year, without the sanction of the Council. (2) If the Council fails to sanction any contract the Chairman may with the approval of the Commissioner enter into such contract notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1).

12

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that this Court could

consider the severity of the charges framed against the Petitioner in deciding

whether the suspension is reasonable and relied on the following paragraph from

Faleel vs Munasinghe and Others12 to support his argument.

In my view, the charges taken singly or collectively do not show that the

administration of the Council had deteriorated to such an extent as would justify

an order suspending the appellant from office. Some of the charges are of a

trivial nature; others are not sufficiently grave to warrant an order of

suspension.

I agree that an elected member must not be at the mercy of a Minister who may be

from a rival political party, and that suspension cannot be on trumped up charges.

On the other hand, it is important that elected officials maintain the highest

standards of financial discipline and integrity when dealing with public finance. After

all, they are the trustees of the People. In my view, a charge that a contract worth

over Rs. 5 million was executed in contravention of the law, which is one of the

charges levelled against the Petitioner, is certainly not trivial. After all, the objective

that is sought to be achieved by an inquiry being conducted is to ensure good

governance and financial discipline by the elected representatives of the people and

prevent abuse of power and mismanagement.13

The Petitioner has produced several documents and offered lengthy explanations as

to why the said charges contained in P10 have no basis and should therefore be

quashed along with P8. I must state that it is not the function of this Court to play

the role of the Inquiry Officer and evaluate the evidence that has been produced by

the Petitioner, in order to determine if the Petitioner should be exonerated from the

charges that have been framed against him. The Petitioner may present all this

evidence before the 5th Respondent at the inquiry that is due to be held.

The Petitioner states further that some of the charges contained in P10 pertain to a

period prior to August 2019, and that had the charges been so severe, disciplinary

12 SC Appeal No. 40/93; SC Minutes of 5th May 1994. 13 Vide Yatawara vs Sarath Ekanayake and Others; supra.

13

proceedings should have commenced earlier and that there is no rational basis to

suspend the Petitioner now. It is clear from the submissions of the learned Additional

Solicitor General that the Respondents have not rushed to take a decision against the

Petitioner but have instead afforded him room to rectify his mistakes and ensure

that the affairs of the Council are managed efficiently and honestly. Thus, the

decision not to act in 2019 cannot accrue to the benefit of the Petitioner.

Furthermore, the fact that the Respondents did not take steps in 2019 effectively

rebuts the allegations of mala fides that have been made against the 1st Respondent.

The documents that have been produced by the 1st Respondent illustrate that there

are allegations against the Petitioner which require to be gone into at an inquiry with

the participation of the Petitioner. Therefore, the decision of the 1st Respondent to

initiate an inquiry by the appointment of the 5th Respondent is a decision taken by a

sensible authority acting with due appreciation of its responsibilities.

The second matter that I must consider is whether the 1st Respondent acted

reasonably in suspending the Petitioner by P8. Section 184 (1A) of the Ordinance,

does not make it mandatory that the Chairman be suspended pending the outcome

of the inquiry. The decision whether to suspend the Chairman is therefore at the

discretion of the Minister or like in this case, the 1st Respondent.

The learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that the Petitioners conduct and

behaviour displayed a complete breakdown of the affairs of the administration of the

Urban Council, and that the 1st Respondent had to take steps to suspend the

Petitioner and conduct an inquiry in order to control the maladministration and the

rapidly deteriorating state of affairs.

In Mendis vs Berty Premalal Dissanayake and Others,14 the Inquiry Officer was

appointed to inquire into the charges against the petitioner on 30th April 2004, and

the inquiry commenced on 22nd July 2004. By an order dated 06th August 2004, the

Minister suspended the Petitioner's membership and Chairmanship of the

Pradeshiya Sabha of Thalawa. Having considered the provisions of Section 185(3) of

the Pradeshiya Sabha Act, this Court held as follows:

14[2006] 2 Sri LR 402.

14

Section 185 (3) specifically provides that when the Minister appoints a retired

judicial officer under subsection (2) to inquire into any matter, the Minister may,

as the circumstances of each case may require by order published in the Gazette

suspend the Chairman from office.

By this provision the Minister has discretion to suspend the Chairman

depending on the circumstances of each case. Suspension may involve hardship

and may cast a slur on the good name and reputation of a duly elected member

of a local authority; as such the discretion must be exercised reasonably and

with circumspection. .... The suspension is due to an exceptional situation which

plainly call for swift and immediate action; action directed to prevent a break

down in the administration of the Sabha; that the circumstances call for the

suspension of the Chairman from office in order to control the mal-

administration. In other words, what is envisaged is a state of affairs which call

for prompt action in order to arrest a rapidly deteriorating situation, lest there

be a breakdown in the administration of the Sabha. Therefore the Minister is

given a discretion to suspend the Chairman at the time of the appointment of

the retired judicial officer to inquire into the matters in issue.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that P10 lists the

documents which the prosecution will be relying on and that the 5th Respondent

does not need to embark on further fact finding in order to conduct his inquiry and

that there is no risk that the Petitioner will influence the inquiry. He submitted

further that the Petitioner had been suspended as a form of punishment, and that in

any case, the suspension of the Petitioner pending the inquiry would cause

irremediable damage to the good reputation of the Petitioner as an honest politician

and that the circumstances of this case do not warrant a suspension of the Petitioner

prior to any proof or likely possibility of guilt.

In terms of Section 184(1B)(a)(i), simultaneous with the appointment of a retired

Judicial Officer to conduct an inquiry, the 1st Respondent may suspend the Chairman

as the circumstances of each case may require. Therefore, it is clear that suspension

is not mandatory, and that it is at the discretion of the 1st Respondent. The issue

therefore is whether the 1st Respondent acted reasonably in arriving at the decision

that the Petitioner must be suspended. I have to go back to the submission of the

15

learned Additional Solicitor General in order to answer this question. Issues relating

to the administration of the Embilipitiya Urban Council arose in 2019, just over a year

after the Petitioner became the Chairman. The first to complain were the members

of the Council. The fact that the Petitioner did not have the support of the

membership of the Council is evident from his own letters dated 27th August 2019

marked 1R12a and 17th September 2019 marked 1R12b, by which the Petitioner

has admitted that the membership has refused to approve the expenditure already

incurred by the Petitioner. It is for these reasons that the then Governor summoned

a meeting on 21st August 2019 and advised the Petitioner to ensure that the affairs of

the Council are managed efficiently and honestly, and placed the Petitioner on notice

that the matters raised by the members would be investigated.

An investigation has in fact been conducted by a Committee of three members who

has recommended that steps be taken against the Petitioner. It must be noted that

the Petitioner has not divulged to this Court the fact that such an investigation was

held. Even assuming that the incident relating to the CCTV system had taken place in

2019 and that suspending the Petitioner in 2021 would not serve any purpose, the

issue that is of concern is that the Petitioner decided to proceed with the award of a

contract for the provision of security services having a value of Rs. 5.2 million without

obtaining the approval of the membership of the Urban Council or without the

approval of the Commissioner of Local Government. This is a clear violation of

Section 39 of the Act. Financial management and discipline are paramount for a local

authority and its Chairman. The Petitioner has therefore acted in blatant disregard of

the law. The fact that the Petitioner sought approval of the 3rd Respondent a few

days prior to P8 being issued is in my view, irrelevant, and is a further

demonstration that the Petitioner first engages in transactions and then seeks

approval.

In my view, an exceptional situation had arisen of the Chairman of the Council acting

in violation of the law and swift action was therefore required to prevent the

administration of the Council going down the slippery slope. The deteriorating

situation had to be arrested and that is what the 1st Respondent has done by

suspending the Petitioner. In these circumstances, I am of the view that the decision

of the 1st Respondent to suspend the Chairman is reasonable.

16

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that a Chairman of a

council can be suspended only as a holding up operation and strenuously relied on

the judgment of the Supreme Court in Faleel v Susil Moonesinghe and Others15 to

support his position. In that case, the 1st respondent Chief Minister who was also the

Minister of Local Government suspended the petitioner from the post of Chairman of

the Beruwela Urban Council to which the petitioner had been elected in May 1991.

While in this application it is admitted that the applicable law is found in the Urban

Councils Ordinance, it was admitted in Faleel v Susil Moonesinghe and Others that

the provisions of the Urban Councils Ordinance do not apply as the Western

Provincial Council had enacted the Devolution of Powers of Supervision of the

Administration of Local Authorities Statute, No. 4 of 1991, and that what was

applicable were the provisions of the said Statute.

Section 2(1) and 2(2) of the said Statute are similar to the provisions found in the

Ordinance. The procedure in the Statute with regard to suspension, which is found in

Section 2(3) thereof, is however different to the provisions of the Ordinance.

Section 2(3)(a) of the Statute reads as follows:

(a) Before appointing a retired Judicial Officer under sub section (2) to

inquire into any matter the Minister may without hearing or other

formality as a holding operation, pending the proposed inquiry and

report by such officer preliminarily,

(i) suspend the Chief Executive Officer of the Local Authority from

office and direct the Deputy Mayor or Vice Chairman of the Local

Authority as the case may be ... to exercise the powers and perform

the duties of the Chief Executive Officer

It would thus be seen that unlike under the Ordinance where the power of

suspension can only be exercised once the Minister has appointed a retired Judicial

Officer to inquire into and report upon such matter for the purpose of satisfying

himself with regard to any of the matters referred to in Section 184(1) of the

15 Supra.

17

Ordinance, under the Statute, the Minister can suspend a Chairman prior to

appointing a retired Judicial Officer.

It is in that context that Chief Justice G.P.S. De Silva held as follows:

Mr. H.L. De Silva, for the appellant submitted that the words as a holding

operation in Section 2(3) of the Statute were designedly used as a limiting

factor on the power of suspension; that those words envisage a crisis or an

emergency in the administration of the Council. On the other hand, Mr. L.C.

Seneviratne for the respondent, strenuously contended that on the plain

meaning of the words, the construction sought to be placed by Mr. De Silva is

untenable; that there is nothing in the statute which warrants the restriction of

the making of an order of suspension to a crisis or emergency in the

administration of the Council. Mr. Seneviratne argued that the words as a

holding operation mean no more than suspension pending inquiry as a matter

of good administration.

On a reading of Section 2(3), it is clear that the making of an order of

suspension is discretionary; it is not automatic. Suspension may involve hardship

and may cast a slur on the good name and reputation of a duly elected member

of a local authority; as such, the discretion must be exercised reasonably and

with circumspection. The words without hearing or other formality which

precede the words as a holding operation are crucial to a proper

understanding of the scope of the power of suspension. These words strongly

suggest an exceptional situation which plainly calls for swift and immediate

action; action directed to prevent a breakdown in the administration of the

Council; that the circumstances call for the removal of the appellant from office

in order to control the maladministration. It is not a step to be taken lightly or as

a matter of course. In other words, what is envisaged is a state of affairs which

call for prompt action in order to arrest a rapidly deteriorating situation, lest

there be a breakdown in the administration of the Council.

Thus, it is clear that the Supreme Court increased the threshold that must be

satisfied in order to suspend a Chairman in view of the fact that a suspension is not

preceded by a decision to have an inquiry. The legal situation in this application is

18

different in that the 1st Respondent has already appointed a retired Judge of the High

Court and the inquiry proceedings must be concluded within three months, unlike in

the situation in Faleel vs Munasinghe and Others where the suspension took place

without the appointment of an inquiry officer, thereby depriving Faleel of the

safeguard of having an inquiry conducted by a Judicial Officer within three months.

Furthermore, the Minister must be satisfied that the circumstances may require a

suspension.

When I consider the fact that the conduct of the Petitioner has been under review

since mid 2019 and the fact that he has executed a contract worth over Rs. 5 million

without obtaining the approval of either the Council or the Commissioner of Local

Government and thereby violated the provisions of Section 39 of the Ordinance, I am

fortified in my view that the high threshold laid down by the Supreme Court in Faleel

vs Munasinghe and Others has been achieved in this application and that the

decision to suspend the Petitioner is not unreasonable.

This brings me to the final submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner. He submitted that the Petitioners term of office as the Chairman of the

7th Respondent expires on or about 9th March 2022, and that if the inquiry under

reference continues for an extended period of time, a significant portion of the

remainder of the Petitioners term would lapse. The Petitioner states that it would

therefore tantamount to an expulsion.

It would perhaps be appropriate to refer at this stage to the following paragraph

from Yatawara vs Sarath Ekanayake and Others,16 which outlines the safeguards in

the Law that ensures that the rights of a member are protected while an inquiry can

also be conducted:

Members are elected by the people to the pradeshiya sabha every five years,

with an expectation that the members so elected would address the day to day

issues of the ward in an expeditious and efficient manner. However, not only

should the elected representatives of the people be efficient, they should ensure

good governance at all times and maintain strict financial discipline in respect of

the funds of the local authority and refrain from any abuse of power. The Act

16 Supra.

19

provides a mechanism by way of Section 185 to address incompetence,

mismanagement, misconduct and abuse of power and thereby ensure good

governance by empowering the Minister to suspend and/or remove a member,

Chairman or dissolve even an entire local council.

The legislature however has been conscious that the powers of suspension and

removal of a member, conferred on the Minister by Section 185 of the

Pradeshiya Sabha Act can be abused. The provisions in Section 185(1)-(3) of the

Act seeks to strike a balance between the powers of the Minister to deal with

mismanagement and abuse of power on the one hand and the rights of the

Chairman to protect himself from any arbitrary exercise of that power by the

Minister, on the other. As part of this process, several checks and balances have

been set out in Section 185 of the Act.

The Act specifies that a suspension can be effected only once an Inquiry Officer

has been appointed. The Act requires the Minister to appoint a retired Judicial

Officer to inquire into such mismanagement, inefficiency and abuse of power,

thereby demonstrating the seriousness with which the inquiry must be

conducted and the credibility that is attached to the inquiry. In keeping with the

principles of administrative law, the Inquiry Officer is required to provide both

parties an opportunity to lead the necessary oral and documentary evidence to

substantiate the charges as well as rebut the charges, thus ensuring that the

principles of a fair hearing are adhered to at all times during the inquiry. The

Inquiry Officer is required to submit a report within a period of three months of

being appointed, to enable the Minister to satisfy himself with regard to the

allegations against the Chairman, the member or the Council itself. As held by

the Supreme Court in Sarath Dharma Siri Bandara vs. Sarath Ekanayake17, the

Minister cannot remove the Chairman on his own accord and the report of the

Inquiry Officer is necessary for the Minister to take a decision. The entire process

outlined above must therefore be conducted in a manner that is fair by all

parties.

It is in this background that this Court, while agreeing with the decision of the

Supreme Court in Sarath Dharma Siri Bandaras case,18 takes the view that an

Inquiry Officer must take control of the proceedings and endeavour to conclude

the inquiry as expeditiously as possible and within the 3 month period initially

made available. Any extension of time must be supported by adequate reasons

from the Inquiry Officer as to why the inquiry could not be concluded within 3

months. Such a course of action would ensure that the objective of Section 185

of the Act is achieved.

I agree that a suspension must not be imposed as a means of punishment or

expulsion, and that the inquiry must be conducted expeditiously with the co-

operation of both parties. In this instance, the inquiry has not even commenced in

view of the undertaking given that the parties will await the outcome of this

application. Once the inquiry is commenced by the 5th Respondent and in the event

an extension of time is sought at the end of the three month period, the 1st

Respondent must ascertain the necessity for such an extension and why the inquiry

could not be concluded within three months, and thereafter consider whether the

suspension of the Petitioner must continue, prior to arriving at a decision.

Taking into consideration all of the above facts, I see no legal basis to issue formal

notice of this application on the Respondents. This application is accordingly

dismissed, without costs.
