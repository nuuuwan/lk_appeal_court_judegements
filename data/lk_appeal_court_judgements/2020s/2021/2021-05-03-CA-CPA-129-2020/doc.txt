Chathuri Wijesuriya, SC for the Hon. AG.

Decided on : 03/05/2021

Hon. Justice Menaka Wijesundera

The instant application for Revision has been filed to revise the order dated

23/06/2020 of the learned High Court judge of Homagama.

The Suspect in the instant application had been taken into custody for being in

possession of less than 1g of heroin. The Hon. Attorney General has indicted the

Suspect Petitioner for being in possession of heroin and trafficking of heroin less than

1g. The Counsel for the Petitioner states that the Petitioner had been in remand for

nearly 1 years upon service of indictment without the trial commencing.

The State Counsel states that the trial has been fixed for today and for Friday but

considering the situation in the country, the State Counsel concedes that the trial will

not be taken up. When a party files a Revision application, the party has to state

exceptional circumstances before this Court in order to obtain bail under the Act

under which the Petitioner had been taken into custody. The exceptionality in the

instant case according to the Petitioners Counsel is the quantity of heroin, the time

period in remand without the trial commencing and especially the situation in the

country plagued by the covid-19 pandemic, however the State Counsel brings to the

notice of this Court that the Petitioner has 12 previous convictions of different nature,

nevertheless considering the covid-19 pandemic which is plaguing the whole country

and endangering the health situation of the inmates of the Prisons, this Court decides

to set aside the Order dated 23/06/2020 of the learned High Court Judge of

Homagama and enlarge the Suspect on bail.

1) The Suspect is enlarged on Rs. 50,000.00 cash bail with two sureties to the

value of Rs. 100,000.00 each.

2) The Petitioner Suspect is instructed to report to the Piliyandala Police Station

on every 2nd and 4th Sunday of every month.

The Registrar of this Court is instructed to communicate this order to the Registrar of

the High Court of Homagama.

The instant application for Revision is hereby allowed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
