ARGUED ON : 16.02.2021

DECIDED ON : 17.02.2021

R. Gurusinghe, J.

The Accused-Appellant (Appellant) was indicted in the High Court of Trincomalee for

committing the murder of Nadarasa Sudharan on 22nd of July 2006, an offence punishable under

Section 296 of the Penal Code. After trial the learned High Court Judge convicted the Appellant

for the offence and sentenced to death.

The Appellant appealed against the said Judgment and sentence dated 23rd July 2015 on the

grounds set out in the appeal.

The Appellants position right throughout the trial was that the deceased tried to grab hold of the

gun that was in possession of the accused. The Accused-Appellant was serving as a home guard

officer at a building called APC building which was located in Kachchakoditeeve an area which

was a war zone during the year 2006. The duty of the Appellant was to give security to the APC

and the nearby camp. This was the time that war between Army and the LTTE was at its peak.

The incident happened on 22nd July 2006 around 11.30 a.m. Appellant came out to the road to

see if the vehicle carrying lunch for the soldiers was coming. At that time, he noticed a man (the

deceased) on a racing bicycle roaming around in that area. He noticed the deceased three times.

The Appellants position is that all of a sudden, the deceased came towards the Appellant and

attempted to grab hold of the gun; the Appellant cried out for help shouting Corporal,

Corporal. However, before the Corporal came for help the Appellant pushed the deceased and

the deceased fell on the ground and then the deceased put his hand into the pocket of his shorts

that he was wearing inside the sarong. At that moment, the Appellant realised that he was taking

out a hand grenade or a pistol and as the Appellant has to act very quickly, he had no option but

to fire the deceased. He fired a shot and ran into the APC building.

Prosecution has called the following witnesses and produced the T 56 gun and the post-mortem

report of the deceased. The prosecution called PW2 T.K.D.S.Gamini Army Corporal who was in

charge of the place, PW10 M.A.N. Jakath, Pw19 the doctor, P1W17 the Inspector of Police,

PW1 S.M. Nawas and PW5 S. Mekala.

PW2 has given evidence to the effect that he was in charge of an army sentry point that was

located in the APC building of Kachchakoditeeve to provide security. The Appellant was doing

his duty as a home guard under witness No. 2 on the day of the incident. PW2 heard the shout

Corporal, Corporal and immediately he heard a gun fire. PW2 rushed to the scene and

inquired from the Appellant as to what had happened. Then the Appellant told him that the

deceased had attempted to grab hold of the gun and scuffled and fell. This witness also admitted

that there were LTTE activities present during the time of the incident. He further said that

neighbouring area was occupied by the LTTE. Witness No. 2 then informed the police and the

police came there. When the police tried to lift the body of the deceased, they found a grenade.

PW2 said police had asked him to take the grenade and then PW2 had taken it from the pocket of

the shorts of the deceased. He said that it was a live grenade. The police witness said that the

grenade was detonated later on the orders of the Magistrate.

The deceased was not a known person to the accused. After the prosecution case is closed, the

Accused-Appellant has given evidence from the witness box. The Appellant was cross examined

by the State. The Appellant has given evidence on oath and stated what had really happened. He

has stated that the deceased came on a racing bicycle and tried to grab hold of his gun. He

shouted Corporal Corporal Corporal for help but before the PW2 came, he pushed the

deceased and the deceased fell on the ground. Then the deceased tried to take out something

from his pocket of his shorts, the accused said that he had feared for his life and fired a shot at

the deceased.

The Accused-Appellant had maintained this position right throughout the trial. There were no

eye witnesses who had seen the incident. The witness No. 2 came to the scene immediately after

the incident. He had asked from the Appellant what had happened and the Appellant told him the

same as he had testified in the Court. In the Judgment the learned trial Judge has stated that the

4

Accused-Appellant had given evidence from the dock. However, the Accused-Appellant had

given evidence from the witnesss box and cross examined by the State Counsel. The learned

High Court Judge weighed the Accused-Appellants evidence as unsworn evidence. This is a

serious misdirection on the part of the trial Judge.

The High Court Judge had stated in the Judgment that Court suspects whether one shot only be

fired when a person opens fire for his self-defence. It means that the Court does not accept it as

true

The view of the Trial Judge in this regard cannot be accepted. The accused has not exceeded the

right of self-defence. In the case of James Chandrasekera 44 NLR page 97, it was held that the

onus is not a heavy one. The burden is no higher than that which rests upon a party to civil

proceedings.

The Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the Respondent conceded the fact that the Judgment

cannot be supported in view of the serious misdirection on the part of the trial Judge. We are of

the view that the Accused-Appellant has proved on a balance of probabilities that he had

exercised the right of private defence.

The police have found a live hand grenade in the shorts of the deceased. In view of that

evidence, it is probable that the deceased had attempted to grab hold of the gun that was in

possession of the Accused Appellant. It is also probable that the deceased attempted to use the

grenade he was carrying.

There was no evidence to show that the deceased was a known person to the Appellant. At the

time of the incident the accused being a public servant who was entrusted with the task of giving

security to that area during the peak of the war, against the LTTE.

The learned High Court Judge seems to have taken the view that the grenade could have been

introduced because it dropped when the body was lifted. There is no evidence to support this

view; it is purely a conjecture. But the witness No. 2 said it was taken out from the shorts of the

5

deceased. However, the fact that there was a grenade was proved. It was taken out in the

presence of the police.

Therefore, there is no doubt that the deceased was carrying a hand grenade at the time of the

shooting. The Accused-Appellant has proved on the balance of probabilities that he had acted in

the exercise of the right of private defence.

For the reasons set out above, we are of the view that the conviction is not safe and cannot allow

to stand. The conviction is quashed and the Accused-Appellant is acquitted of the charge. The

appeal is allowed.
