Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

The Petitioner had joined the Hayleys Group of Companies as an executive in 2008.

The Petitioner states that by sheer diligence and hard work, he rose through the

ranks to be appointed as a Manager of the 2nd Respondent, Hayleys Aventura (Pvt)

Limited, a member of the Hayleys Group. The Petitioner states that he left the 2nd

Respondent on 31st May 2018 seeking better employment opportunities. The

Petitioner has thereafter joined M/s Aletek International Private Limited, which

according to the 2nd Respondent is engaged in business which is in direct competition

to the area of business of the 2nd Respondent.

On 6th December 2018, the 2nd Respondent had filed Case No. HC (Civil) 37/2018 in

the High Court of the Western Province (the Commercial High Court) against the

Petitioner. In its plaint, the 2nd Respondent had stated that the Petitioner is

contractually bound and obliged by his Contract of Employment with the 2nd

Respondent to maintain confidentiality in respect of confidential information

obtained in the course of the Petitioners employment with the 2nd Respondent. It

was further alleged that during the course of his employment, the Petitioner had

been privy to confidential information and/or undisclosed information of the 2nd

Respondent, which information had been presented to the Commercial High Court

by way of confidential cover.

The 2nd Respondent, having cited certain correspondence that the Petitioner has had

with suppliers of the 2nd Respondent, had stated that it verily believes that the

(Petitioner) without any legal right is continuously using the confidential

information/undisclosed information/ commercially sensitive business information of

the (2nd Respondent) to the benefit of Aletek International (Pvt) Limited through the

aforesaid unlawful, illegal and dishonest trade practices.1

The 2nd Respondent had sought inter alia the following relief from the Commercial

High Court:

a) A declaration that the Petitioner in the course of commercial activities has

acted contrary to honest practices constituting acts of Unfair Competition;

1 Vide paragraph 23(c) of the plaint.

3

b) Damages against the Petitioner in a sum of Rs. 200 million in lieu of the

Petitioners dishonest trade practices amounting to Unfair Competition.

The above action had however been settled between the parties on 11th December

2018, by the Petitioner undertaking not to make use and/or disclose directly and/or

indirectly to any party, undisclosed information within the meaning of Section 160(6)

of the Intellectual Property Act No. 36 of 2003 (the IP Act), with such undertaking to

be valid until 11th December 2019. The 2nd Respondent had not complained to the

Commercial High Court of any violation of the above undertaking by the Petitioner.

The Petitioner states that on 3rd March 2020, after the period of the above

undertaking had expired, the 2nd Respondent had filed action against the Petitioner

in the Magistrates Court, Colombo Case No. 30656/04/20 in terms of Section 136 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, as amended.

Section 136(1)(a) reads as follows:

Proceedings in a Magistrates Court shall be instituted in one of the following

ways:

(a) on a complaint being made orally or in writing to a Magistrate of such

court that an offence has been committed which such court has jurisdiction either to inquire into or try: Provided that such a complaint if in writing shall be drawn and countersigned by

a pleader and signed by the complainant; or ......

The steps that a Magistrate is required to take on a complaint made under Section

136(1)(a) have been set out in Section 139, the relevant portions of which are re-

produced below:

Where proceedings have been instituted under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b)

or paragraph (c) of section 136 (1) and the Magistrate is of opinion that there

is sufficient ground for proceeding against some person who is not in custody-

4

(a) if the case appears to be one in which according to the fourth column of

the First Schedule a summons should issue in the first instance, he shall,

subject to the provisions of section 63, issue a summons for the attendance

of such person;

(b) if the case appears to be one in which according to that column a warrant

should issue in the first instance, he shall issue a warrant for causing such

person to be brought or to appear before the court at a certain time:

Provided that

(i) the Magistrate may in any case, if he thinks fit, issue a summons in the

first instance instead of a warrant;

(ii) in any case under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of section 136 (1), the

Magistrate shall, before issuing a warrant, and may, before issuing a

summons, examine on oath the complainant or some material witness or

witnesses; and ......

The Petitioner has produced marked P3a the several documents that had been filed

by the 2nd Respondent in the Magistrates Court, which included the report signed by

the Attorney-at-Law for the 2nd Respondent setting out the offence which the

Petitioner is said to have committed; the charge sheet; an affidavit of the Managing

Director of the 2nd Respondent, and a list of witnesses and documents.

The complaint of the 2nd Respondent to the Magistrates Court is reflected in the

charge sheet that had been filed in the Magistrates Court, and reads as follows:

In terms of Section 160(8)(a) of the IP Act:

Any person, who wilfully and without lawful authority, discloses any

undisclosed information shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall on

conviction after trial before a Magistrate be liable to a fine not exceeding five

hundred thousand rupees or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six

months or to both such fine and imprisonment.

A definition of undisclosed information is found in Section 160(6) of the IP Act.

It is admitted by the parties that the ingredients of the above offence would consist

of the following:

a) The accused must possess undisclosed information;

b) The accused should have disclosed same;

c) Such disclosure must be willful;

d) Such disclosure must be without lawful authority.

Thus, according to the charge sheet, the Petitioner was being accused of divulging

undisclosed information to his new employer. As noted earlier, the 2nd Respondent

had filed an affidavit of its Managing Director. The said affidavit must therefore

necessarily contain the factual circumstances relating to the said charge and must

support the above charge against the Petitioner.

The application to have summons issued on the Petitioner had been supported

before the Hon. Magistrate on 4th March 2020. By an order dated 29th June 2020, the

Hon. Magistrate had directed that summons be served on the Petitioner.

Aggrieved by the said decision of the Hon. Magistrate to issue summons, the

Petitioner filed this application on 5th August 2020, seeking inter alia the following

relief:

6

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the said order of the Hon. Magistrate to

commence proceedings and/or issue summons;

b) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the Hon. Magistrate from taking any further

steps in Magistrates Court, Colombo Case No. 30656/04/20.

Where a complaint is made in terms of Section 136(1)(a), as in this application, prior

to issuing summons, the Hon. Magistrate must form an opinion that there are

sufficient grounds to proceed against the person named. The learned Presidents

Counsel for the Petitioner, the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the 1st

Respondent and the learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent have all drawn my

attention to the judgment of this Court in Malinie Guneratne vs Abeysinghe and

another2 where Sarath N. Silva, J / P,CA (as he then was) identified in the following

paragraph, the manner in which a Magistrate must proceed when issuing summons

under Section 139:

Section 139 (1) requires a Magistrate to form an opinion as to whether

there is sufficient ground for proceeding against some person who is not in

custody. I am of the view that the opinion to be formed should relate to the

offence the commission of which is alleged in the complaint or plaint filed

under section 136(1). The words 'sufficient ground embraces both, the

ingredients of the offence and the evidence as to its commission. The use of the

word opinion does not make the action of the Magistrate a purely subjective

exercise. Since the opinion relates to the existence of sufficient ground for

proceeding against the person accused, the material acted upon by the

Magistrate should withstand an objective assessment. I am of the view that the

proper test is to ascertain whether on the material before Court, prima facie,

there is sufficient ground on which it may be reasonably inferred that the

offence as alleged in the complaint or plaint has been committed by the

person who is accused of it

The primary argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner was that

the learned Magistrate had not considered the material that was placed before him

nor has he considered the ingredients of the offence that the Petitioner was charged

2 (1994) 3 Sri LR 196.

7

with in the context of the material that was before him, and therefore the decision of

the Hon. Magistrate to issue summons on the Petitioner is illegal and unreasonable.

The order of the Hon. Magistrate reads as follows:

meusKs,a, i,ld ne,Sfuka wk;=rej wmrdO kvqQ jsOdk ix.%yfha 139 j.ka;sh m%ldrj

pQos;g is;dis ksl=;a lrus

It was submitted on behalf of the Petitioners that the case record did not contain a

meusKs,a,, and that what was available to the Hon. Magistrate were the documents

marked P3a. In any event, it is clear from the above order that the Hon. Magistrate

has not considered the ingredients of the offence the Petitioner was charged with

nor has the Hon. Magistrate considered the material that was placed by the 2nd

Respondent by way of the affidavit of its Managing Director, in order to ascertain if

the averments in the affidavit support the charge. The Hon. Magistrate has therefore

clearly acted in breach of the obligation cast on him by Section 139 to issue

summons only where he is of the opinion that there is sufficient ground to proceed

against the Petitioner in respect of the offence specified in the charge sheet.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the 1st Respondent, whilst submitting that

the issuance of summons is in terms of the law, submitted that in arriving at a final

determination on whether an offence has been committed, it would be vital to

maintain the requisite balance between preventing unfair competition and restraint

of trade and submitted that any finding of guilt must be arrived at with caution and

with a proper understanding of the difference between unfair competition and

restraint of trade. While this submission was made in the context of it being the

threshold that must be satisfied at the end of the trial, I am of the view that given the

complex nature of the offence and the intricacies thereof, and especially the fact that

the Petitioner is a former employee of the 2nd Respondent who is now said to be

engaging in the same business as that of the 2nd Respondent, there must be due

consideration to these issues even at the stage the Magistrate is called upon to issue

summons. As held by this Court in Malinie Guneratne vs Abeysinghe and another,

the decision of the Magistrate must withstand an objective assessment and hence

the necessity for the Magistrate to set out the basis for his opinion.

8

Taking into consideration all of the above circumstances, I am of the view that the

Hon. Magistrate has acted outside the jurisdiction conferred on him and the decision

to issue summons is clearly illegal and is therefore liable to be quashed by a Writ of

Certiorari.

The aforementioned submission of the learned Deputy Solicitor General gives rise to

another aspect that I wish to advert to. A Magistrate who is called upon to decide if

sufficient grounds exist to issue summons on a private plaint must act with

circumspection, for the reason that such a complaint is not preceded by an

investigation by an independent law enforcement agency, and can arise from a

private animosity or may have been filed for a collateral purpose. In other words, a

Magistrate must be alive to the fact that the process of Court may be abused by a

complainant in a private plaint and it is for that reason that the Magistrate must

consider the material before him in the context of the ingredients of the offence,

before issuing summons, thus preventing the criminal justice system from being used

in an arbitrary manner. A Magistrate must therefore exercise caution when issuing

summons on a private plaint for the reason that the consequence of issuing

summons is to make an innocent person stand trial as an accused. To permit a case

without merit to be taken through the criminal justice system has an impact on the

private and work life of an accused as well as cause an unnecessary burden on an

already burdened criminal justice system.3

While it is mandatory that the evidence of the complainant should be led where a

warrant is sought, it is not so where the application under Section 139 is limited to

summons. In exercising his discretion whether the complainant should be heard even

where only summons is being sought, it would be appropriate for a Magistrate to

bear in mind the following passage from the judgment of the Supreme Court in Peter

Leo Fernando vs The Attorney General and Others4 which sets out the rationale for

the recording of evidence prior to issuing a warrant:

The requirement as to the examination of the complainant is imperative and

should be strictly complied with in order to prevent a false, frivolous and

3 See the judgment of the Federal Court of Malaysia in Sundra Rajoo Nadarajah vs Menteri Luar Negeri, Malaysia & ORS [Civil Appeal No: 01(F)-38-12-2020(W) 9th June 2021] in the context of the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General. 4 [1985] 2 Sri LR 341 at 349.

vexatious complaint being made to harass an innocent party and to waste the

time of the Court. The substance of the examination, reduced to writing, should

be distinct from the complaint itself. The examination is not to be a mere

form , but must be a full and intelligent inquiry into the subject-matter of the

complaint, carried far enough to enable the Magistrate to exercise his

judgment and see if there is a prima facie case or sufficient ground for

proceeding. The examination should be on facts which are within the

complainant's knowledge: Kesri v. Muhammad Baksh; Chitaley and Rao, The

Code of Criminal Procedure VoI. I, 1121; Sohoni's The Code of Criminal

Procedure, 16th Ed., Vol.II, 1235.

This Court, in Derek Kelly and another vs Yasasiri Kasthuriarachchi5 having followed

the judgment in Malinie Guneratne vs Abeysinghe, went onto state as follows:

In Sohoni's The Code of Criminal Procedure, 16th Ed., Vol II, 1234 it is stated

that the object of this provision is to prevent the issue of process in cases where

the examination of the complainant would show that the complaint was clearly

false, frivolous or vexatious, and that further proceedings would tend merely to

harass unnecessarily an accused person and waste the time of the Court. The

underlying principle for the examination of the complainant at the time of filing

a complaint is to ascertain whether the complaint established a prima facie

case; that is, whether the facts disclosed in the petition of complaint called for

investigation by a criminal court. It is to help the Court concerned to find out

whether there were materials sufficient for the purpose of summoning the

accused or for an enquiry into the grievances made by the complainant.

In my view, the above judgments reflect the circumspection that must be exercised

by a Magistrate when acting under Section 139(1)(a), as well.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted further that the charge

sheet is vague and is therefore defective. The learned Counsel for the 2nd

Respondent quite correctly submitted that the charge sheet is yet to be served on

the Petitioner and that any objection thereto can be taken at the time the charge

sheet is served. 5 CA (PHC) Appeal No. 57/2008; CA Minutes of 7th September 2012.

10

In the above circumstances, I issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the Order made by

the Hon. Magistrate of Colombo in Case No. 30656/04/20 on 29th June 2020 to issue

summons on the Petitioner. I am not inclined to consider the Writ of Prohibition that

has been sought as I am of the view that this Court must not fetter the right of a

complainant to set in motion the wheels of justice.

This judgment shall not prevent the 2nd Respondent from making a further

application to the Hon. Magistrate to act in terms of Section 139 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act. Such an application, if made, shall be considered by the Hon.

Magistrate in terms of the law.

I make no order with regard to costs.
