Suharshi Herath SCC., for AG.

ARGUED ON : 25.01.2021

DECIDED ON : 24.02.2021

R. Gurusinghe J.

The Accused-Appellant was tried before the High Court of Polonnaruwa

on a charge of rape of a woman who was mentally retarded, punishable

under section 364(2)(f) of the Penal Code.

After trial the Accused-Appellant was convicted and sentenced to a term

of 20 years rigorous imprisonment and to a fine of a sum of Rs. 10,000/-

and ordered to pay a sum of Rs.200,000/- to the PW1 as compensation.

The main ground of appeal argued for the Appellant before this Court is

that there was no sufficient evidence to establish that there had been

penetration.

Prosecution witness No.04 stated that the brother of the prosecutrix,

Jinadasa had informed him that his sister, the prosecutrix was dragged by

force to the jungle by the accused. Jinadasa had informed the incident

immediately to the prosecution witness number 2 and 4. The prosecution

3

witness number 4 had gone to the place which Jinadasa had shown.

When they had gone near the jungle, they had heard a cry which PW4

said to be of the prosecutrix. As the accused had a knife, they did not go

further. The prosecution witness number 4 stated that he had clearly

identified the accused. The incident happened during the daytime. The

accused was on top of another. PW4 stated that he had identified the

other person by her voice. PW2 informed the incident to the son of the

prosecutrix PW3.

The prosecution witness number 11 also rushed to the house of the

prosecutrix. PW11, Nilmini, daughter-in-law of the prosecutrix giving

evidence stated that she had seen the accused coming from the jungle.

Accused has asked her whether she had seen Susantha there. PW11

replied that she did not see him. The Accused went to the place where his

motorcycle was parked and took it and left. Immediately after that she

saw the prosecutrix coming towards the house covered with blood. Her

hair and the clothes were in disarray. The prosecutrix was then taken to

the hospital. The clothes that the prosecutrix was wearing at that time

were produced in evidence marked P3, P4 and P5.

According to the evidence of the Doctor PW6 who examined the

prosecutrix less than six hours of the incident, the prosecutrix had several

injuries. There was a contusion above the left brow, a laceration on left

side of lower lip, a contusion around both nipples of breasts, a contusion

at the vaginal opening. The report also states that sexual assault present.

Sexual penetration cannot be excluded.

The prosecutrix was a mentally retarded 55 years old person. The brother

of the prosecutrix, Jinadasa is also a mentally retarded man. Both of

4

them were listed as witnesses for the prosecution. The prosecutrix was

called as a witness; however, she could not answer to the questions

rationally.

Immediately after the accused had dragged the prosecutrix by force to the

jungle Jinadasa informed to PW2 and PW4 of the incident. PW4 had

gone to the place within few minutes. He saw that accused was on top

of another. He identified the prosecutrix by her voice.

There was no suggestion that the person under the accused was somebody

other than the prosecutrix. Witness No. 11 also had seen the accused

coming from the jungle near the prosecutrixs house. Immediately after

he left, the prosecutrix also came covered with blood and disarrayed hair

and clothes. She had several injuries. All this evidence direct to the

conclusion that the accused had raped the prosecutrix.

In the appeal the main ground of the Accused-Appellant is that the

prosecution had failed to prove that there was penetration. As the

prosecutrix was mentally retarded, she was not able to give evidence in

regard to the incident. However, as stated earlier, there were other

witnesses including an eye witness.

The Judicial Medical Officer PW6, giving evidence stated that there was

a contusion at the opening of vulva. The doctor says this could happen

when one tried to access forcibly.

In this regard in the case of Perera Vs. Attorney General 2012 (1) Sri LR

69, Justice Ranjith Silva quoted the following passage with approval.

5

The slightest penetration of the penis within the vulva, such as minimal

passage of glans between the labia with or without emission of semen or

rupture of hymen constitute rape.

There need not be a completed act of intercourse. Rape can be committed

even when there is an inability to produce penile erection. Rape can be

occurred without any injury and as such negative evidence does not

exclude Rape.

(Vide 308 of the Book entitled The Essential Forensic Medicine and

Toxicology by Dr. K.S. Narayan Reddy)

In this case, there was a contusion at the opening valve. This is evidence

for penetration. Quoting a passage from judgment of CA 88/2002,

Counsel for the Appellant argued that the Judicial Medical Officer had

not mentioned about labia.

The relevant passage of that judgment is thus:

In a case of rape, one has to prove penetration. Penetration can be

minimum and placing penis between the labia majora or labia minora

could be sufficient.

Since there was no reference to labia majora or labia minora, it was

argued that there was no penetration. The above case refers to minimum

penetration. In this case, there was injury at vaginal opening; that is

beyond labia. Therefore, the argument of the Appellant that there was no

penetration cannot be accepted.

6

In view of the above findings, we see no reason to interfere with the

verdict of the trial Judge.

The accused was sentenced to 20 years rigorous imprisonment. This is

the maximum sentence prescribed for the offence by law. The accused

has no previous convictions. He is 36 years old, married and having two

children receiving education. Wife of the Appellant according to them is

without employment. Having regard to the above term of imprisonment

for 20 years is considerably excessive.

The sentence imposed on the Accused-Appellant is reduced to 12 years

rigorous imprisonment.

We direct that the sentence is deemed to have been served from the date

of the conviction, namely 17/01/2017. We make no change to the rest of

the sentence.

Subject to the variation of the term of imprisonment appeal of the

Accused -Appellant is dismissed.
