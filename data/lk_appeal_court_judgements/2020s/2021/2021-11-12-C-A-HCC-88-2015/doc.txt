Devika Abeyratne,J

The Accused Appellant Rubasinha Liyanage Ruwan was indicted before

the High Court of Matara on the following Counts.

1. Abduction to have illicit intercourse with H.G. Imalka Harshani, an

offence punishable under section 357 of the Penal Code.

2. Committing the offence of rape on the above victim, an offence punishable

under section 364(1) of the Penal Code.

3. Committing the murder of the said victim, an offence punishable under

section 296 of the Penal Code.

After a non jury trial he was found guilty on all 3 counts and sentenced to

8 years Rigorous Imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10000/- with a default sentence

of 1 year rigorous imprisonment for the first count, and 16 years Rigorous

3

Imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10000/- with a default sentence of 1 year

imprisonment for the second count and the Death Sentence for the third count.

Aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence the accused appellant

has preferred his appeal to the Court of Appeal.

The appellant was connected through Zoom technology and informed

Court that he has given instructions to his Counsel to argue the matter in his

physical absence, due to the covid pandemic.

In the written submissions of the appellant the following grounds of appeal

have been raised.;

1. The trial Court has failed to apply or appreciate the principles governing

the evaluation of Circumstantial Evidence.

2. The Learned Trial Judge has erred in law and fact by failing to consider

that the prosecution has not ruled out the possibility of a party committing

the offence.

3. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to appreciate the many

inconsistencies between the evidence of the prosecution witnesses

thereby failing to consider that the evidence led at the trial was

insufficient to rebut the presumption of innocence.

The case for the prosecution rested on and the accused was convicted on

circumstantial evidence.

4

The facts of the case albeit briefly are as follows;

On 13.02.2007 the daughter of PW 1 the deceased 16 year old school girl

had informed her father that she was staying after school to attend some extra

classes. PW 1 who had returned from work around 4.30 pm after being informed

that the daughter had not returned from school, has gone in search of her to the

bus halt where she usually gets off. There he has met one Maddumage Mahinda

who had informed that he has seen a girl who looks like his daughter going past

the ball court carrying a school bag. It had also been informed by an owner of

a boutique that the child had bought some sweets from his shop. After the search

to find the daughter failed, PW 1 had informed that his daughter was missing to

the Deniyaya Police by telephone around 8.45 pm and with the help of the

villagers continued with the search when PW 3 Krishantha had discovered the

body of the girl in an abandoned house that belonged to Gamini PW 2.

It was in evidence that there is a shortcut to the house of PW 01 which is

situated close to the abandoned house, and the house of the appellant and a

person called Ariyawansa. The house of the grandparents where PW 6 was living

although on a higher elevation, was also in close proximity to this road which

was used by the deceased and other villagers, which begins near the bus halt.

The distance from the abandoned house to the house of PW 1 is about one and a

half to two kilometers.

According to medical evidence PW 19 the JMO, the young girl had been

raped and strangulated and he has observed 26 injuries on the victims body. The

defence called Dr Illaperuma who testified that the DNA samples that were sent

for analysis was degraded. Therefore, no analysis of DNA is available in this

case.

5

It was revealed in the evidence of the police witness PW 21, that the

statement of PW 6 the child witness was recorded based on the statement of PW

12 Siriyawathi. According to PW 12 on the day of the incident when she was

walking in the area close to the house where the body was found, she has heard

Ariyawathi the grandmother of PW 6 shouting at someone using words to the

following effect;

Page 230

: ?

:

.

She had assumed that Ariyawathi was scolding PW 6 and informed about

what she heard to the police in her statement. Based on PW 12s statement, the

police have thereafter recorded the statement of PW 6 . The Police witness

PW 18 Dharmadasas evidence is that most statements of witnesses have been

recorded based on rumours and information gathered from the villagers.

According to the evidence elicited at the trial, it is unclear whether

Siriyawathi has informed the Police that she saw PW 6 in the area when

Ariyawathi was heard shouting. It can only be presumed that Siriyawathi has

assumed that Ariyawathi was scolding PW 6, and it appears that on that

assumption the police have recorded the statement of PW 6.

In the above circumstances the failure of the police not recording a

statement from Ariyawathi is surprising and questionable . The woman who was

alleged to have been shouting at someone in abusive words described above and

who is the guardian of PW 6 who was a minor, not being questioned the reason

for her shouting and at whom she was shouting is difficult to comprehend.

6

The evidence of PW 6 is that Ariyawathi does not scold him in the manner

stated above and that he too was unsure at whom she was shouting. The interest

of the police to record a statement from a ten years old boy who was considered

to be the recipient of that abuse, who later was made a star witness had to be

explained by the prosecution, especially when the evidence relied on was

circumstantial evidence.

However, the lapses on the police investigations should not be all allowed

to impair the relevant issue, which is the statement of PW 6, who appears to be

a witness who have seen the victim a few hours before her death in the company

of the appellant.

PW 21 who had been the investigating officer had recorded the statement

of PW 6 on 20.02.2007 at 18.30 hours at the house of the child (page 379 and

380 of the brief). However, contradicting that position PW 6 has testified that he

went to the Deniyaya Police Station with his grandmother where he was taken

in to a room alone and his statement was recorded. The Police officer had denied

this position when it was put to him in cross examination. The prosecution has

failed to clarify this position. Although there is a question under what

circumstances or where the statement of PW 6 was recorded, it has not affected

the evidence of PW 6 and no material contradictions or omissions were marked

based on that statement.

According to PW 6 who was 10 years old at the time of the incident (he

was sixteen years old when he gave evidence) he has seen the deceased whom

he knew, who was in school uniform and carrying her school bag, being dragged

by the accused appellant who was covering the mouth of the deceased with his

hand towards the abandoned house around 5 pm when he was going down the

path to have a bath in the river.

7

He has heard his grandmother Ariyawathie shouting around that time and

without having a bath he had returned home. One reason him returning was to

see who the grandmother was shouting at. (Page 131 bottom of the brief)

Thereafter, he had waited in his room without disclosing what he saw to anyone.

On the night after the incident, PW 6 his grandparents, two aunts and his uncle

had been home, but he has not divulged what he saw to anyone. He has later

visited the crime scene to see the dead body of the victim who was called

Bonikki because she was a pretty child.

Four days later the police have come to get a statement from him where he

has testified to what he saw on that day. The accused appellant has been in police

custody at that time. In his evidence PW 6 from page 138 onwards of the brief

has stated several reasons why he did not disclose what he saw to any family

member, teacher or his school friends. One reason being his fear of PW 1, stating

Considering the above evidence, the probability factor of PW 6 not saying

what he witnessed a few hours before the body was recovered has to be very

carefully analysed and evaluated.

It is to be noted here that the learned trial judge who delivered the judgment

did not have the benefit of observing the demeanour and deportment of the

witness. The learned trial judge in page 524 of the brief has stated that the

explanation given by the child that he did not inform his grandmother because

she faints for the slightest reason is believable and accepted. It is further stated

that from the answers of PW 6 it can be concluded that he seems to be a child

who will try to live out of controversy in the following manner.

,

.

.

.

.

.

The learned trial judge has been impressed with the testimonial

trustworthiness and has accepted the evidence as creditworthy and truthful. The

learned trial judges analysis was assailed by the counsel for the appellant that it

was improbable.

10

In page 18 of the Judgment the learned trial judge has gone on to say;

,

, .

,

.

.

Although this analysis seems to be based on assumptions by the learned

trial judge, the analysis does not take away the convincing and cogent evidence

of PW 6. He has faced a lengthy cross examination from page 123 to 153 of the

brief giving convincing, unwavering and intelligent answers. He was not

confused with his evidence. So much so a predecessor judge at page 150 of the

brief has made this observation.

( m%Yak

.)

Ratnasinh Dalsukhbhai Nayak v State of Gujarat 2004 (1) SCC 64 is a case where it is stated that;

The decision on the question whether the child witness has

sufficient intelligence primarily rests with the trial Judge who notices his

manners, his apparent possession or lack of intelligence, and the said

Judge may resort to any examination which will tend to disclose his

capacity and intelligence as well as his understanding of the obligation of

an oath. The decision of the trial court may, however, be disturbed by the

11

higher court if from what is preserved in the records, it is clear that his

conclusion was erroneous. This precaution is necessary because child

witnesses are amenable to tutoring and often live in a world of make-

believe. Though it is an established principle that child witnesses are

dangerous witnesses as they are pliable and liable to be influenced easily,

shaken and moulded, but it is also an accepted norm that if after careful

scrutiny of their evidence the court comes to the conclusion that there is

an impress of truth in it, there is no obstacle in the way of accepting the

evidence of a child witness.

(This passage was quoted in Nivrutti Pandurang Kokate v State of Maharashtra

(2008 (12) SCC 565) and State of Karnataka v Shantappa Madivalappa Galapuji

(2009 (12) SCC 731))

In Ranjeet Kumar Ram V State of Bihar (2015 SCC Online SC 500)

where the evidence of a seven year old child, who was the sole witness was

considered the Indian Supreme Court has stated that by concurrent findings

courts below found her evidence unassailable and we find no ground to take a

different view. And Evidence of the child witness and its credibility would

depend upon the circumstances of each case. Only precaution which the court

has to bear in mind while assessing the evidence of a child witness is that the

witness must be a reliable one.

In the instant case, PW 6 has given a clear and consistent narrative of what

he saw. There is no evidence to conclude that the trial judges had an issue about

evaluating the evidence which the witness had seen when he was 10 years old.

12

In State of UP. v Krishna Master AIR 2010 SC 3071 it was held;

This Court is of the firm opinion that it would be doing injustice to

a child witness possessing sharp memory to say that it is inconceivable for

him to recapitulate facts in his memory witnessed by him long ago. A child

of tender age is always receptive to abnormal events which take place in its

life and would never forget those events for the rest of his life. The child

would be able to recapitulate correctly and exactly when asked about the

same in future.

On a consideration of the following authorities from other jurisdictions the

perception of evidence given by child witnesses can be further clarified.

In the case of R v Barker [2010] EWCA Crim 4 Lord Chief Justice

(England and Wales Court of Appeal) it was held;

(At Para 40) We emphasise that in our collective experience

the age of a witness is not determinative on his or her ability to give truthful

and accurate evidence. Like adults some children will provide truthful and

accurate testimony, and some will not. However children are not miniature

adults, but children, and to be treated and judged for what they are, not

what they will, in years ahead, grow to be. Therefore, although due

allowance must be made in the trial process for the fact that they are

children with, for example, a shorter attention span than most adults, none

of the characteristics of childhood, and none of the special measures which

apply to the evidence of children carry with them the implicit stigma that

children should be deemed in advance to be somehow less reliable than

adults. The purpose of the trial process is to identify the evidence which is

reliable and that which is not, whether it comes from an adult or a child.

If competent, as defined by the statutory criteria, in the context of

13

credibility in the forensic process, the child witness starts off on the basis

of equality with every other witness. In trial by jury, his or her credibility

is to be assessed by the jury, taking into account every specific personal

characteristic which may bear on the issue of credibility, along with the

rest of the available evidence.

It was recognized in England as early as 1778 that children could be

competent witnesses in criminal trials. In R v Brasier (168 Eng. Rep. 202 (1779))

it was held;

.. that an infant, though underage of seven years, may be sworn in-

a criminal prosecution, provided such infant appears, on strict

examination by the Court, to possess a sufficient knowledge of the nature

and consequences of an oath .... for there is no precise or fixed rule as to

the time within which infants are excluded from giving evidence; but their

admissibility depends upon the sense and reason they entertain of the

danger and impiety of falsehood, which is to be collected from their

answers to questions propounded to them by the Court; but if they are

found incompetent to take an oath, their testimony cannot be received

...

In the Canadian Supreme Court in R v R.W. [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122 the

changes that had undergone with regard to the law effecting the evidence of

children in the recent years has been considered. It has referred to R. v. B.

(G.), 1990 CanLII 7308 (SCC) ;[1990] 2 S.C.R. 30, at pp. 54-55, where Wilson.J

has stated;

... it seems to me that he was simply suggesting that the judiciary should

take a common sense approach when dealing with the testimony of young

children and not impose the same exacting standard on them as it does on

adults. However, this is not to say that the courts should not carefully assess

14

the credibility of child witnesses and I do not read his reasons as suggesting

that the standard of proof must be lowered when dealing with children as

the appellants submit. Rather, he was expressing concern that a flaw, such

as a contradiction, in a child's testimony should not be given the same effect

as a similar flaw in the testimony of an adult. I think his concern is well

founded and his comments entirely appropriate. While children may not be

able to recount precise details and communicate the when and where of an

event with exactitude, this does not mean that they have misconceived what

happened to them and who did it. In recent years we have adopted a much

more benign attitude to children's evidence, lessening the strict standards

of oath taking and corroboration, and I believe that this is a desirable

development. The credibility of every witness who testifies before the courts

must, of course, be carefully assessed but the standard of the "reasonable

adult" is not necessarily appropriate in assessing the credibility of young

children.

As stated earlier in the judgment the learned counsel for the appellant

sought to impugn the testimonial trustworthiness and credibility of PW 6 mainly

on improbability of his evidence and the belated statement to the Police.

With regard to delay in PW 6 giving a statement to the police, in Queen

vs Pauline de Croos 71 NLR 169, it was observed by T.S Fernando J that a

delayed witnesses evidence could be acted upon if there were reasons to explain

the delay.

In Kahandagamage Dharmasiri V Attorney General SC appeal

NO.04/2009 decided on 19th July 2011, where the statement of a nine year old

witness who witnessed his mother being murdered whose statement was

recorded three weeks after the incident Thilakawardena J stated;

15

The Appellant stressed on the fact that even the 2nd eye witness

(the son of the deceased) Madurangas statement was belated and was as

a consequence a fabrication and concoction. Whilst it is desirable for

prompt statements to be made after an incident, the relevance is that this

would pre-empt or forestall the likelihood of the opportunity for

fabrication of the facts. It was held in the case of Sumanasena V

Attorney-General (1999) 3 Sri. L.R 137 at 140;

just because the witnesses is a belated witness the Court ought

not to reject his testimony on that score alone and that a court must

inquire into the reason for the delay and if the reason for the delay is

plausible and justifiable the Court could act on the evidence of a belated

witness.

In the instant case, it is elicited that there is about a four day delay in giving

the statement of PW 6. This 10 year old child was living with his grandparents.

On one hand there is no evidence to evaluate his relationship with his

grandparents or the aunts and uncle he has referred to in his evidence. A reaction

of a boy who is in a loving family having the trust and confidence that he will be

protected is different to a child living with his extended family. Admittedly, each

child will react differently to a similar situation faced by him or her. It will be

based on their age, education, intelligence, family background and support, his

psychology and such circumstances.

From Siriyawathi PW 12s evidence when she heard Ariyawathi shouting

at someone she has assumed it was to PW 6 she was shouting which may have

been normal behaviour of the grandmother to the 10 year old boy. PW 6 has

insisted that he usually was not scolded in that language by his grandmother.

16

In the following Indian authorities it was considered that the evidence of a

child witness must find adequate corroboration, before it is relied upon as the

rule of corroboration is of practical wisdom than of law. (Prakash Vs. State of

M.P.(1992) 4 SCC 225; Baby Kandayanathi Vs. State of Kerala, 1993 Supp

(3) SCC 667; Raja Ram Yadav Vs. State of Bihar, (1996) 9 SCC 287)

In Panchi and Others Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh (1998) 7 SCC 177 of the

Indian Supreme Court it was held that the evidence of a child witness must be

evaluated more carefully and with greater circumspection because a child is

susceptible to be swayed by what others tell him and thus a child witness is an

easy prey to tutoring. It was further held that the law is that the evidence of a

child witness must be evaluated more carefully and with greater circumspection

because a child is susceptible.

In Bhagwan Singh and Ors Vs. State of M.P. (23.01.2003) of the

Supreme Court of India it was held that; that he sole testimony cannot be relied

without the corroborative evidence; the evidence of a child is required to be

evaluated carefully because he is an easy prey to tutoring; therefore always the

court looks for adequate corroboration from other evidence of his testimony; It

is hazardous to rely on the sole testimony of the child witness as it is not available

immediately after the occurrence of the incident and before there was any

possibility of coaching and tutoring him.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswami in his treatise Law of Evidence Vol 2 book

2 at page 658 has stated referring to child witnesses;

There is no requirement in English law, that the sworn evidence

of a child witness needs to be corroborated as a matter of law. But the

jury should be warned, not to look for corroboration, but of the risks

17

involved in acting on the sole evidence of young girls or boys, though they

may do so if convinced of the truth of such evidence This requirement

is based on the susceptibility of children to the influence of others and to

the surrender to their imaginations.

At page 659 it states, As regards the sworn testimony of children,

there is no requirement as in England to warn of the risks involved in

acting on their sole testimony, though it may be desirable to issue such a

warning, though the failure to do so will generally not affect the

conviction.

M.Ajith Kumara alias Ajith Vs. Attorney General in CA No 2018/2012,

decided on 26.09.2014,where the evidence a boy of 5/6 years where he has

witnessed a gruesome murder was considered, Gooneratne J, had held that there

was no basis to intervene and interfere in the reasoning of the trial judge and

further went on to state that the defence had not succeeded in making any

breakthrough in the evidence of the child witness to favour the defence case.

From the above cited authorities it is apparent that corroboration is not

expected in each and every case when courts have to decide on the evidence given

by children. The credibility of the evidence of a child witness would depend on

the circumstance of each case.

The child not divulging what he saw until the police came for him which

would have been scary experience has to be considered very carefully. On the

one hand PW 6 may not have initially read too much in to what he witnessed

when he saw the girl being grabbed and pushed towards the abandoned house.

However, when a few hours later when the body of the victim was discovered

PW 6 obviously may have been petrified, disturbed and worried not knowing

18

what to do. The childs reaction, his mental status, his fear and reason why he

did not divulge the incident to anyone may have been motivated for self

preservation. However, his testimony to Court is without any material omissions

or contradictions. His evidence is that even to the Police he has tried not to

divulge what he saw, but as stated in page 143 of the brief, when he could not

withhold it any longer he has blurted it out. No evidence has been established

that PW 6 was tutored or coached or that his evidence was to implicate the

appellant purposefully. His uncontradicted evidence the learned trial judge has

believed without any reservations, which is justifiable.

PW 6 has clearly identified the appellant as Ruwan Mama who he said

was the person who took the victim towards the house of PW3. This evidence

was not affected by cross examination. There were no contradictions or omissions

19

with regard to his evidence. There was no ground or legal barrier set forth by the

defence for Court to disregard the evidence of PW 6.

The counsel for the appellant unsuccessfully attempted to show that PW 6

was giving evidence against the accused appellant, as PW 6s uncle Sumith

was not in good terms with the appellant. PW 6 has clearly answered that he did

not know of any known animosity existed between his uncle Sumith and the

appellant. This evidence was unchallenged and believable.

In the overall perusal of the evidence of PW 6 it is quite clear, coherent,

cogent, without any reservation and believable which has not been challenged in

cross examination. Therefore, the trial judges conclusion is justifiable.

After the conclusion of the argument the Counsel for the appellant has

submitted to this Court many authorities in support of the grounds that were raised

on behalf of the accused appellant. It is very salutary of the counsel to assist court

in that respect.

I have closely perused the evidence, the submissions and the relevant

authorities pertaining to the issues raised in this case.

I have also considered the following issue.

It is trite law that the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case beyond

reasonable doubt. This being a case that has rested mainly on circumstantial

evidence from which the inference of guilt is drawn must be cogently established;

it must also be established that the crime was committed by no one else but by

the accused; the evidence should only be consistent with the guilt of the accused

and inconsistent with his innocence.

20

As stated earlier PW 6 has given very clear and cogent evidence that he

saw the accused appellant dragging the victim towards PW 3s house with her

mouth closed.

In the Dock Statement of the accused appellant he has stated that as his

children were sick he was not in the area and was at his mother-in-laws house

and he was informed of the incident when he returned home on the following day.

In evidence it transpired that his house is in close proximity to the house where

the body was recovered and anyone who is alighting from the bus could be seen

from his house.

PW 6 had testified very clearly that the appellant was seen dragging the

victim towards the house where the body was found. He has specifically stated

that the distance between him and the accused appellant was about 30 meters and

as it was around 5 pm he could clearly identify the appellant, and that the accused

appellant did not observe his presence. When there was such clear evidence

implicating the appellant, there was never even a suggestion that PW 6 was lying

about seeing what he said he witnessed. The suggestions made on his behalf was

that PW 6 was giving evidence against the appellant because his uncle Sumith

was not in good terms with the appellant.

However, neither the Dock Statement nor the evidence adduced on behalf

of the accused has raised a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case.

In the case of State of Tamil Nadu Vs. Rajendran (1999) Cr.L.J.4552 the

Indian Supreme Court observed that;

In a case of circumstantial evidence when an incriminating

circumstance is put to the accused and the said accused either offers no

explanation or offers an explanation which is found to be untrue, then

21

the same become an additional link in the chain of circumstances to

make it complete.

Abbot J. in Rex Vs. Burdett (1820) 4 B & Ald 161 at 162 observed that;

No person is to be required to explain or contradict until

enough has been proved to warrant a reasonable and just conclusion

against him, in the absence of explanation or contradiction; but when

such proof has been given, and the nature of the case is such as to admit

of explanation or contradiction, if the conclusion to which the prima

facie case tends to be true, and the accused offers no explanation or

contradiction, can human reason do otherwise than adopt the

conclusion to which proof tends.

In the case of Rajapaksha Devage Somarathna Rajapaksha

And Others Vs. Attorney General (SC Appeal) 2/2002 TAB) Justice

Bandaranayke observed that;

With all this damning evidence against the appellants with the

charges including murder and rape the appellants did not offer any

explanation with regard to any of the matters referred to above.

Although there cannot be a direction that the accused person must

explain each and every circumstance relied on by the prosecution and

the fundamental principle being that no person accused of a crime is

bound to offer any explanation of his conduct there are permissible

limitation in which it would be necessary for suspect to explain the

circumstances of suspicion which are attached to him.

On consideration of the totality of the evidence of the prosecution

witnesses and the authorities cited above we are of the view that there is no reason

to interfere with the conclusion reached and sentence imposed by the Learned

22

High Court Judge of the Matara on 27.03.2015. Accordingly we affirm the

conviction and the sentence and dismiss the appeal.
