Introduction

[1] This is an Appeal by the Appellant by way of a case stated against the

determination of the Tax Appeals Commission dated 07.05.2019 confirming

the determination made by the Respondent dated 26.11.2015 and

dismissing the Appeal of the Appellant. The years of assessment related to

2008/2009, 2009/2010 and 2010/2011.

Factual Background

[2] The Appellant Mr. Lasith Malinga is a well-known national cricketer. The

Appellant was contracted to the Sri Lanka Cricket, the official body

responsible for the governance of the sport of cricket in Sri Lanka

(hereinafter referred to as the SLC). His main source of income was

essentially the contract and match fees paid to him by SLC in terms of the

Players Annual Contract. The Appellant was also an employee of Brandix

Lanka (Pvt) Ltd and in addition, he entered into several agreements with

private companies for advertising and promoting their products and

services. Accordingly, the Appellant received income from the following

sources during the relevant periods of assessment:

1. Income received from the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) under the Players

Annual Contract during the above-mentioned periods;

2. Employment Income from Brandix Lanka (Pvt) Ltd during the above-

mentioned periods; and

3

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

3. Income from Advertisement and promotion of several private

companies, such as Britanial Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., W. G. N. Global Services

(Pvt) Ltd and Mobitel (Pvt) Ltd.

[3] On 09.08.2008, the Sri Lanka Cricketers Association wrote to SLC

expressing its concerns over the decision taken by SLC not to award a central

contract to the Appellant and stated inter alia, that the Appellant was injured

while representing Sri Lanka and as a result, he lost match fees and tour

payments. The Sri Lanka Cricketers Association requested SLC to reconsider

its decision not to award a central contract to the Appellant and get him back

playing as soon as possible. Having noted the said request contained in the

letter sent by the Sri Lanka Cricketers Association, SLC decided on

16.09.2008 to compensate the Appellant by affording him a sum of US $

15,000 (Rs. 1,609,500/-).

Basis for the Assessment

[4] The Appellant submitted his returns of income for the said years of

assessment, claiming exemptions under Sections 13 (v), 8 (1) (f) and 13 (f) of

the Inland Revenue Act. The Assessor by letter dated 18.11.2013 however,

refused to accept the same and issued assessments for the following

reasons:

1. Year of assessment 2008/2009

(a) In terms of the Contract with SLC, the total taxable income paid to the

Appellant by SLC was Rs. 6,150,420/-, which consists of Rs. 1,609,500/-

for compensation as a rest player, Rs. 472,986 as sponsorship fees

from Dilma Company and Rs. 4,067,934/- for the period of cricket

played for SLC. The Appellant has, however, declared only Rs.

1,898,262/- in his statement of accounts understating his

employment income of Rs. 4,252,158/-;

(b) Although the Appellants employment income from Brandix Lanka

(Pvt) Ltd was Rs. 1,230,000/-, he has declared it as Rs. 952,500/- and

thus, understated the said income by Rs. 277,500/-;

(c) The Appellant has understated the cash and non-cash benefits as per

the contracts entered with companies for trade promotion and

advertising as follows:

4

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

i. The total income received from Britania Lanka (Pvt) Ltd was Rs.

3,762,500 but the said income has been declared only as

Rs.1,750,000;

ii. The total income received from W. N. G. Global Services (Pvt) Ltd

was Rs. 1,400,295 but the Appellant has declared only Rs.

701,123;

iii. The Appellant has not declared the payment of Rs. 1,500,000/-

and a sum of Rs. 480,000/- as non-monetary benefit of telephone

facilities provided free of charge from Mobitel Pvt Ltd; and

iv. The Appellant has failed to submit all the details and documents

requested by the Assessor by his letters and thereby failed to

prove the correctness of his returns.

2. Year of assessment 2009/2010

(a) The total Income received from SLC in terms of the contract is Rs.

4,001,426/- and the amount from participating in provincial cricket

matches held with local cricketers is Rs. 23,000/-. The Appellant has

declared only Rs. 2,654,747/- understating the income of Rs.

1,369,679/-;

(b) The failure to declare the value of telephone facilities of Rs. 480,000/-

provided by Mobitel Pvt Ltd as a free of charge for providing trade

promotion and advertising for the company;

(c) The failure to submit all the details and documents requested by the

Assessor by his letters and thereby failed to prove the correctness of

his returns.

3. Year of assessment 2010/2011

(a) The total income received from SLC in terms of the contract is Rs.

12,689,337/- which consists of Rs. 11,136,401 received from contracts

with SLC, Rs. 97,977/- from inter provincial cricket matches and the

sponsorship payment from Mobitel Pvt Ltd in sum of Rs. 1,454,959/.

The Appellant has, however, declared only Rs. 1,803,023/- which

amounts to an under declaration of income of Rs. 10,886,314/-;

(b) The benefit received from Mobitel Pvt Ltd for the free

telecommunication facilities amounting to Rs. 480,000/- has not been

declared as an income;

5

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

(c) The failure to declare the balance of the commercial bank in a sum of

Rs. 3,984,294.77;

(d) The failure to submit all the details and documents requested by the

assessor by his letters and thereby failed to prove the correctness of

his returns.

[5] The Assessor has exempted the match fees paid to the Appellant in

relation to matches played in Sri Lanka with competitors from outside Sri

Lanka under Section 13 (v) of the Act, but determined that all other

payments, including contract fees and match fees paid to the Appellant in

connection with matches held outside Sri Lanka are liable to income tax.

Accordingly, the Assessor assessed the Appellant for the said three years of

assessment, taking into consideration the Appellants income liable to tax as

follows (Vide- pages 132-134 of the Tax Appeals Commission brief):

Appeal to the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue

[6] Being dissatisfied with the said assessment, the Appellant appealed to

the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) and the Respondent by its determination dated 26.11.2015

confirmed the assessments. The Respondent determined that contract fees

and match fees cannot be exempted under section 8 (1) (j) of the Inland

Revenue Act in respect of matches held outside Sri Lanka but match fees

paid to the Appellant in respect of matches held in Sri Lanka with the

participation of competitors outside Sri Lanka, are exempted from tax under

Section 13 (v) of the Inland Revenue Act.

Appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission & the Court of Appeal

[7] Being dissatisfied with the said determination of the Respondent, the

Appellant appealed to the Tax Appeals Commission and the Tax Appeals

Commission by its determination dated 07.05.2019 confirmed the

determination of the Respondent and dismissed the Appeal. Being

dissatisfied with the said determination of the Tax Appeals Commission, the

Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

[8] The amounts of tax in dispute for the years of assessment are as follows:

Questions of Law in the Case Stated

[9] The Appellant has formulated the following Five Questions of Law in the

Case Stated for the opinion of the Court of Appeal.

1. Assuming without conceding that sum of Rs. 1,609,500/- received by

the Appellant in respect of which exemption in terms of Section 13 (f)

of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 was claimed, is not a capital

sum by way of compensation for an inquiry, having regard to the ratio

decidendi of the case of Craib v. Commissioner of Income Tax (Report of

Ceylon Tax Cases Vol. 1 page 156), did the Commission err in law in

holding that, that the amount which is neither a contract payment nor

a payment for services, nor a payment to which the Appellant was

entitled, is income liable to tax?

2. Did the Commission err in law in concluding that the fees received by

the Appellant in terms of the contract he had with Sri Lanka Cricket, in

respect of which exemption was claimed in terms of Section 13 (v) of

the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006, are not exempt in terms of that

provision, which conclusion is based on an erroneous interpretation of

the word participation which occurs in the relevant provision?

3. Did the Commission err in law in concluding that the fees received by

the Appellant in terms of the contract he had with Sri Lanka Cricket, in

respect of which exemption was claimed in terms of Section 8 (1) (j) of

the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 as well, are not exempt in terms

of that provision, which conclusion is based on an irrelevant and

extraneous consideration that any payment made in Sri Lanka has to

be in rupees in order to avoid violation of the Exchange Control Act?

4. Having regard to the meaning of the word income as explained in the

case of Thornhill v. Commissioner of Income Tax (Report of Ceylon Tax

Cases Volume 1 page 180), is the sum of Rs. 1,609,500/- referred to in

the question of law number one is income at all within the meaning of

the judicial definition referred to in the case?

5. Are not the amounts received by the Appellant in terms of the contract

he had with the Sri Lanka Cricket in respect of which exemption was

8

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

claimed in terms of Section 13 (v) and 8 (1) (j) of the Inland Revenue Act,

No. 10 of 2006 exempt in terms of the said provisions?

6. Did the Commission fail to appreciate the facts and the law relating to

the matter under consideration properly and to apply the law correctly?

[10] At the hearing of the appeal, Mr. Senaka De Seram, the learned Counsel

for the Appellant and Mr. Manohara Jayasinghe, the learned Senior State

Counsel for the Respondent, made extensive oral submissions and

thereafter written submissions were filed on behalf of the both parties.

Main Issues for determination

[11] In view of the submissions made by Mr. De Seram and the learned

Senior State Counsel, the determination made by the Tax Appeals

Commission and the Questions of law formulated, this Court is now invited

to determine the following man questions:

1. On the facts and in the circumstances of this case, whether the contract

fees and the match fees received by the Appellant in US Dollars in

relation to matches played outside Sri Lanka are exempted from

income tax under section 8 (1) (j) of the Inland Revenue Act (This relates

to the question of law Nos. (3), (5) and (6)).

2. On the facts and in the circumstances of this case, whether the contract

fees and the match fees received by the Appellant in Sri Lanka Rupees

in relation to matches played in Sri Lanka and at which competitor from

outside Sri Lanka participated are exempted from income tax under

section 13 (v) of the Inland Revenue Act (This relates to the question of

law Nos. (2), (5) and (6)).

3. On the facts and in the circumstances of this case, whether the

payment of US$ 15,000 (Rs. 1,609,500/-) granted by the SLC to the

Appellant for the year of assessment 2008/2009 is exempted from

income tax under Section 13 (f) of the Inland Revenue Act as a capital

sum received by the Appellant as compensation for injuries (This

relates to the questions of law bearing Nos. (1), (4) and (6)).

Statutory provisions & categories of persons liable to Income Tax

9

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

[12] Before adverting to the questions at hand, it would be appropriate to

take note of the statutory provisions of the Inland Revenue Act as regards

the categories of persons liable to pay income tax in Sri Lanka and the

sources of income chargeable with tax for the purpose of this case.

Imposition of Income Tax

[13] Section 2 of the Inland Revenue Act provides two modes of taxation,

namely, resident based and non-resident based (source based). Section 2 of

the Inland Revenue Act, which is the charging Section, inter alia, stipulates

that income tax shall be charged for every year of assessment in respect of

the profits and income of every person for that year of assessment.

Resident persons. 2 (1) (a)

[14] Any person who is a resident of Sri Lanka is subjected to the Inland

Revenue Act and liable to pay income tax on the profits and income

earned by such a resident, after getting various deductions therefrom as

admissible under different provisions of the Act. Any resident person in Sri

Lanka is liable to pay income tax if the income arising in Sri Lanka in respect

of the profits and income of such resident person for that year of

assessment.

Non-residents-s. 2 (1) (b)

[15] On the other hand, in case of a non-resident person (which term is

defined in Section 217 read with Section 79 of the Inland Revenue Act) in Sri

Lanka is liable to pay income tax in respect of profits and income of such

non-resident person arising in or derived from Sri Lanka in that year of

assessment. In this sense, the income tax on non-resident is source based,

i.e., source of such income is in Sri Lanka and, therefore, even a non-resident

is liable to pay tax on income earned in Sri Lanka.

Sources of Income & Exemptions-

[16] Section 3 lays down the sources of income that is chargeable with tax

in respect of profits and income or profits or income and enumerates a list

of exceptions to liability. As a general rule, as set out in Sections 2 and 3, is

that any resident or non-resident person is subject to pay tax at the

appropriate rates specified in the relevant schedules to the Act in respect of

the profits and income of such person for that year of assessment arising

10

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

out of any trade, business, profession, vocation, employment dividends,

interest or discounts, rents, royalties or premiums etc.

[17] Having established the general principle that any person who is either

resident of Sri Lanka or non-resident, is subject to the Act and liable to pay

income tax as aforesaid, the Inland Revenue Act sets out exemptions in

Chapter III. In the present case, the Appellant claims that he is not liable to

pay income tax from the contract fees and the match fees received from

SLC, relying on the following exceptions to liability:

1. Section 8 (1) (j) of the Inland Revenue Act;

2. Section 13 (v) of the Inland Revenue Act; and

[18] The Appellant has also claimed that the payment of US$ 15,000/-

received from the SLC is exempt from income tax under Section 13 (f) of the

Inland Revenue Act.

Players Contract with the SLC

[19] Before we consider these exemptions and refer to the authorities which

were cited at the hearing of this appeal, I shall refer in some detail to the

terms of the Players Contract to find out its terms, conditions and the

obligations of the parties under the Players Contract. The Tax Appeals

Commission brief contains the following Sri Lanka Cricket Players Annual

Contracts:

1. Sri Lanka Cricket Players Annual Contract-2006/2007- effective from

01.03.2006 to 28.02.2007 (pp. 23-39);

2. Sri Lanka Cricket Players Annual Contract-2008/2009- effective from

01.03.2008 to 28.02.2009 (pp. 298-314).

[20] The Cricketers Association by its letter dated 09.08.2008 has admitted

that the Appellant was contracted to the SLC during the period from

01.01.2007 to 29.02.2008 (paragraphs 1 and 2 of the letter dated 09.08.2008

at page 151 of the Tax Appeals Commission brief). It is, thus, not in dispute

that the Appellant was under a contract of employment with the SLC during

the relevant periods in question, 2008/2009, 2009/2010 and 2010/2011. The

dispute relates to the Appellants eligibility of the exemptions under Sections

8 (1) (j), 13 (f) and 13 (v) of the Inland Revenue Act.

11

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

[21] In terms of the Sri Lanka Cricket Players Annual Contract, the Appellant

has agreed to abide by the terms, conditions and obligations of the Player

and the SLC has agreed to abide by its obligations as morefully set out in the

said Players Annual Contract. Clause 3 of the contract refers to the

obligations of the Player and clause 4 refers to the Contract fee of the Player.

Obligations of the Player-clause 3

[22] Clause 3.1 refers to the general obligations of the Player such as (to

attend and participate in all training sessions, team meetings and official

functions as directed by SLC and play in all matches, including 75% of the

provincial tournament matches for which he has been selected unless he

has been expressly excused before and by SLC from such attendance and

other conditions laid down in clause 3.1.

[23] Clause 3.2 to 3.7 refers to other specific obligations of the player such

as (i) to attend to cricket promotional activities and maintain fitness; (ii) not

to conduct himself in a manner that may deem him unfit to play in or

incapable of playing in any match or remain a member of the team; (iii) to

adhere to ICC Code of Conduct and Drugs and Doping Rules of ICC; and (iv)

to comply with anti-corruption reporting duty and procedures etc.

Contract fee-clause 4

[24] Clause 4 which refers to contract fee and provides as follows:

4.1 For and in consideration of the due compliance by the player with all of the items, conditions, covenants, stipulations and obligations of the player to be done, observed the performed by the player hereunder the SLC shall pay to the player a contract fee equivalent of United States Dollars Sixty Thousand (US 60,000/-) for the entirety of the Term provided that the Controller of Exchange has granted approval for the payment by the SLC and for receipt by the player of such sum in such currency;

4.1.1. SLC shall pay the player his fees in foreign currency, in respect of

his services rendered abroad during the Term. However, in the event that approval is not available, SLC shall pay to the player the equivalent thereof, at the given time, in Sri Lanka Rupees;

4.1.2. Provided further that in the event that this Agreement is terminated

howsoever, by either party before the lapse of the entirety of the

12

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

Term, SLC shall pay and the player shall be entitled to receive only the pro rata portion of the Contract Fee for the period for the period during which this agreement was in force;

4.1.3. The Contract Fee shall be paid to the Player quarterly by the end of

each quarter;

4.1.4. Provided that in the event of the Player not being selected to the

national squad of any tournament for a period of six (6) months or more due to his poor performance, the player shall only be entitled to 50% of the contract fee he would otherwise be entitled to for the said period. However, if the Player upon being selected for a Tour or prior to being so selected, the player informs of his intention not to participate in such Tour or Matches as the case may be, then SLC shall have the right to withhold sums of money not exceeding 50% of the contract fee payable to the player under this contract;

4.1.5. For avoidance of doubt, where the Player has been selected for a

Tour, but due to no fault of the Player, the Selectors direct to rest the player for a particular Tour or Match, the Player shall, notwithstanding non participation of such Match, due to such direction, be entitled for fees in respect of that Match as the case may be provided the Selectors so informs SLC;

4.1.6. When the Player requests leave of absence to play cricket overseas,

a reduction will be made on pro-rata basis of the Contract Fee. However, such leave will only be granted in the absence of ICC sanctioned international matches (home or abroad) and provincial matches, during such requested leave of absence period. Limitations to the payment of contract fees

[25] The payment of full contract fees to every player having a contract with

the SLC is, however, subject to the following three deductions set out in

clauses 4.1.4 - 4.1.6 of the Contract, namely:

1. Where the player is not selected to the national squad of any

tournament for a period of 6 months or more due to his poor

performance, he is entitled to 50% of the contract fee (clause 4.14);

2. Where the player has been selected for a Tour or Match, but due to

no fault of the player, the selectors direct to rest him for a Tour or

Match, he shall, notwithstanding his non-participation of such Tour

or Match due to such direction, be entitled for fees in respect of

13

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

such Tour or Match provided the selectors so informs SLC (clause

4.15);

3. Where a player is granted leave of absence to play any cricket

overseas, 2.5% of his contract fee will be deducted for every month

such player is on leave (clause 4.16).

Payment of Contract fees

[26] The Players Annual Contract provides that the contract fee equivalent

to of the US Dollars 60,000/- for the entirety of the Term will be paid subject

to the approval by the Controller of Exchange (clause 4.1). Clause 4.1.1

provides that Players fees in foreign currency will be paid by the SLC, in

respect of his services rendered abroad during the term and where the

approval is not available, SLC shall pay to the Player the equivalent thereof

in Sri Lankan Rupees. There is no dispute that in terms of the Players

Contract, the contract fees involve US Dollar and Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR)

components and the US Dollar component is paid in respect of the matches

played abroad and the Sri Lankan Rupee component is paid in respect of

matches played in Sri Lanka.

Match fees

[27] Unlike contract fees, the match fees are not specifically referred to in the Players Contract. However, Clause 4.2 of the Players Contract provides that in addition to contract fees, a Player is also entitled to such other payments as are specified in Schedule IV of the contract as follows:

4.2 In addition to the Contract Fee SLC shall make such payments as are specified in Schedule IV.

[28] The payment referred to in clause 4.2 may include match fees, seniority

fees and other tour payments (see- the tables at pp. 258-259 of the Tax

Appeals Commission brief, which refer to match fees and seniority fees in

addition to contract fees paid to the Appellant). A match fee is generally a

particular amount for every match, paid to a player who has been

nominated to the squad representing the team, depending on the payment

determined by the employer having regard to the type of match (e.g. test,

one day internationals, T 20 etc.) and ranking or grading. However, it was

not disputed that the match fee may differ from format to format of the

14

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

match (test match, one day internationals (ODI) and T 20) and from the

playing 11 who will be paid a fixed individual amount while other members

of the squad will be paid a proportionate lesser and equal amount decided

by the employer (SLC).

[29] It is not in dispute that the SLC has paid match fees in foreign currency

(US Dollars) in respect of matches played outside Sri Lanka and in Sri

Lankan Rupee (LKR) in respect of the matches played in Sri Lanka (Vide- SLC

Letters at pp. 154-160 of the Tax Appeals Commission brief).

Employment Income

[30] Section 4 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act relates to profits from

employment and provides that profits from employment include-

(a) (i) any wages, salary, allowance, leave, pay, fee, pension, commission,

bonus, gratuity, perquisite or such other payment in money which an employee receives in the course of his employment;

(ii) the value of any benefits to the employee or to his spouse, child or parent, including the value of any holiday warrant or passage;

(iii) any payment to any other person for the benefit of the employee or of his spouse, child or parent,

whether received or derived from the employer or others.

(b) (i) any retiring gratuity or any sum received in commutation of

pension;

(ii).. (iii) (iv)any sum received as compensation for loss of any office or employment (v)

[31] Now, the question is whether the contract fees and match fees fall

within the meaning of profits from employment under Section 4 of the

Inland Revenue Act and if so, whether or not they are exempted under

Sections 8 (1) (j) and 13 (v) of the Inland revenue Act as claimed by the

Appellant.

[33] Accordingly, the payments made to the Appellant including contract

fees in respect of matches played in Sri Lanka or outside Sri Lanka had not

been exempted under Section 8 (1) (j) or 13 (v) of the Act. The match fees

granted to the Appellant in respect of matches played in Sri Lanka with the

participation of a foreign competitor had been, however, exempted under

Section 13 (v) of the Act while the match fees in respect of national matches

played in Sri Lanka without the participation of foreign player had not been

exempted under Section 13 (v) of the Inland Revenue Act.

Exemption under Section 8 (1) (j) of the Inland Revenue Act

[34] As per the Sri Lanka Cricket Players Contract, the Appellant has

received, inter alia, the contract fees and match fees in relation to matches

held in Sri Lanka and outside Sri Lanka. The Appellant first claimed that the

contract fees and match fees received by him in respect of matches held

19

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

outside Sri Lanka are exempted from income tax under Section 8 (1) (j) of

the Inland Revenue Act. Section 8 (1) (j) of the Act reads as follows:

The emolument earned or the pension arising in any year of assessment, in

foreign currency, by or to any individual resident in Sri Lanka in respect of-

(i) services rendered by him in that year of assessment; or

(ii) past services rendered by him or his spouse,

outside Sri Lanka in the course of any employment carried on, or exercised by him or his spouse, if such emoluments or pension are paid to him in Sri Lanka or such emoluments or pension (less such amount expended by such individual outside Sri Lanka as is considered by the Commissioner-General to be reasonable expenses) are remitted by him to Sri Lanka.

[35] In order for a taxpayer to succeed in the exemption under section 8 (1)

(j), he must satisfy the following elements:

1. The emolument earned or the pension arising in any year of

assessment, in foreign currency;

2. The emolument or pension paid to any individual resident in Sri

Lanka;

3. The services rendered in the course of any employment carried on,

or exercised by him or his spouse in the same year of assessment;

4. The emoluments paid to the taxpayer in Sri Lanka or such emolument

is remitted by him to Sri Lanka;

5. The emolument or pension paid in respect of services rendered by

him in that year of assessment or past services rendered by him or his

spouse outside Sri Lanka.

Five Requirements in Section 8 (1) (j) of the Inland Revenue Act

[36] Now, I shall consider whether or not the five requirements set out in

Section 8 (1) (j) have been fulfilled by the Appellant.

1. Emoluments paid foreign currency in any year of assessment

[37] As noted in paragraphs 32, the contract fees and match fees have been paid in US Dollars in each year of assessment, 2008/2009, 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 in respect of matches played outside Sri Lanka and thus, the

20

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

requirement that the emolument was earned in foreign currency in any year of assessment has been satisfied.

2. Resident in Sri Lanka

[38] It is not in dispute that the Appellant is a resident in Sri Lanka in terms of the provisions in Section 79 (2) of the Act and thus, the Appellant has satisfied the second requirement.

3. Services rendered in the course of any employment in the same year of assessment

[39] It is not in dispute that the Appellant rendered services to the SLC in the course of employment in the same year of assessment in respect of which returns were filed and thus, the Appellant has satisfied this requirement.

4. Emoluments were paid in Sri Lanka or such emoluments were remitted

by him to Sri Lanka.

[40] The next question is to consider the question whether or not the emoluments were paid to the Appellant in Sri Lanka or such emoluments were remitted by the Appellant to Sri Lanka. The Tax Appeals Commission has taken the view that the exemption under section 8 (1) (j) has no application for the following reasons:

a. The money was not paid to the Appellant in Sri Lanka as the Exchange

Control Act prohibits payments paid to residents in Sri Lanka otherwise

than in Sri Lankan Rupees;

b. There has been no remittance of the money to Sri Lanka by the

Appellant.

[41] As correctly submitted by Mr. De Seram, the second part of section 8

(1) (j) in respect of the place at which the payment of emoluments shall be

made to the taxpayer has two alternative elements. The payment due to

the taxpayer can be made in the following methods:

1. the emoluments can be paid to him in Sri Lanka; or

2. the emoluments can be remitted to Sri Lanka by him.

[42] The Tax Appeals Commission has taken the view that the exemption

has no application as the Exchange Controls Act, No. 24 of 1953 prohibits

21

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

payment being made to residents in Sri Lanka otherwise than in Sri Lankan

Rupees. There is no dispute that the SLC had collected all the payments

due to the players in respect of the matches played outside Sri Lanka

irrespective of any prohibition in the Exchange Control Act. The documents

issued by the SLC at pages 157-160 of the Tax Appeals Commission brief

referring to the dates of payment, cheque numbers and the payment types

reveal that all payments had been made to the Appellant by the SLC in Sri

Lanka. The document at page 160 of the Tax Appeals Commission brief

further reveals that the SLC has transferred all US$ payments to the

Appellants USD Account.

[43] Accordingly, any such prohibition under the Exchange Control Act is

not relevant to the determination of the income tax liability of the taxpayer

under the Inland Revenue Act. The part of the finding of the Tax Appeals

Commission that the Exchange Controls Act prohibits payment being made

to residents in Sri Lanka otherwise than in Sri Lankan Rupees for the

application of the exemption in the present case is in my view, is erroneous

and shall stand corrected.

[44] The Tax Appeals Commission has further stated that as the

emoluments were earned in foreign currency by a resident in Sri Lanka, it

shall be remitted by the Appellant to his NRFC account of a Bank in Sri Lanka

and as the Appellant has not remitted USD payments to Sri Lanka, the

exemption under section 8 (1) (j) has no application. As the SLC has

collected and made payments in US Dollars in Sri Lanka (Vide- pp. 157-160

of the Tax Appeals Commission brief) in respect of the matches played

outside Sri Lanka, it is obvious that the payments had been remitted to the

SLC Account to be paid to the Players in Sri Lanka.

[45] The part of the finding of the Tax Appeals Commission that there is no

proof that the Appellant has remitted the moneys due to him to his Sri

Lankan Bank through a NRFC account will not arise as the payment had

been made to the Appellant in Sri Lanka through SLC. Accordingly, that part

of the finding of the Tax Appeals Commission is erroneous and shall stand

corrected.

5. Services were rendered outside Sri Lanka

22

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

[46] The final requirement to be satisfied is that the services were rendered

by the Appellant outside Sri Lanka. In other words, the question is whether

the disputed income can be categorised as having been received by the

Appellant from services rendered outside Sri Lanka as contemplated by

section 8 (1) (j) or from services rendered within Sri Lanka.

[47] At the hearing of this appeal, Mr. De Seram contended that the

Appellant has not claimed the exemption on the entire contract fee, but

only on that part of the contract fee, which has been paid to him whenever,

the Appellant has participated in the respective matches outside Sri Lanka.

He submitted that the payment of contract fees and matches in respect of

matches played by the Appellant fall within the ambit of the exemption

under Section 8 (1) (j) for the following reasons:

1. The payment of contract fees and match fees involve a US Dollar and

Sri Lankan Rupee component and fees are paid in Sri Lankan Rupees

for matches participated by the Player in Sri Lanka while the fees are

paid in US$ for matches participated by the Player outside Sri Lanka;

2. Whenever matches are played in and outside Sri Lanka, contract fee is

apportioned into Rupee component and US$ component by the SLC

using a formula adopted by the SLC according to the number of

matches played in Sri Lanka and number of matches played outside of

Sri Lanka;

3. The match fees are also paid when a Player participates in matches

and thus, as the Appellant had participated in matches in question

outside Sri Lanka, his match fees paid in respect of matches played

outside Sri Lanka are exempted from income tax under Section 8 (1)

(j) of the Act.

4. The key requirement for the application of the exemption under

section 8(1) (j) is the participation in the match, while other

deducted payments referred to in clauses 4.14, 4.15 and 4.16 of the

Contract are based on the non-participation of the Player;

5. Section 8 (1) (j) is applicable if and only if the Player has participated in

the matches which is the fundamental requirement and the Appellant

23

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

was claiming fees only in respect of the matches participated by him

in Sri Lanka and outside Sri Lanka;

6. The Appellant has participated in all matches without any reduction as

evidenced by the letter of the SLC dated 21.08.2017 (page 227 of the

Tax Appeals Commission brief) and therefore, the fees received by the

Appellant in the form of US Dollar component in respect of matches

participated by the Appellant outside Sri Lanka are exempt from tax

under Section 8 (1) (j) of the Inland Revenue Act; and

7. Once the contract fee is split into rupee and US Dollar components,

the receipts of the US Dollar payment on the basis of the matches

played by the player (participation in matches) abroad is exempt as it

satisfies the requirement in Section 8 (1) (j) while the payment of

contract fee in Sri Lankan component is exempt under Section 13(V) of

the Act.

[48] On the other hand, it was the submission of the learned Senior State

Counsel that subject to the three deductions referred to in clauses 4.14, 4.15

and 4.16 of the Contract, every player having a contract with the SLC is

entitled to receive contract fees or match fees regardless of the number of

matches he has played, whether in Sri Lanka or outside Sri Lanka. He further

submitted that match fee is paid for every match for which a player is

selected to be part of a squad irrespective of whether he plays a particular

match so long as he is part of the national squad selected by the selectors

for such match or tour.

[49] The exemption applies where the emolument by a resident in Sri Lanka

is earned in foreign currency in respect of services rendered outside Sri

Lanka provided that such emolument is either paid to him in Sri Lanka or

such emolument is remitted by him to Sri Lanka. The entire dispute hinges

on the determination of the question whether the emolument earned by

the Appellant in foreign currency in the course of his employment was in

respect of services rendered outside Sri Lanka within the meaning of the

exemption under Section 8 (1) (j) of the Act.

[50] In determining whether the services were rendered outside Sri Lanka

within the meaning of Section 8 (1) (j) of the Act, it is useful to answer the

following questions:

24

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

1. Where the contract was concluded?

2. Who is paying the employee and who deducts any payment due to the

employee?

3. Who the services are being rendered to?

4. How the services are being rendered?

5. Is the participation of the player in matches a requirement for the

purpose of determining that the player rendered services outside Sri Lanka?

6. Where the services are being rendered?

1. Where the contract was concluded?

[51] The contract of employment was entered into by the SLC and the

Appellant in Sri Lanka. The Appellant chose a Sri Lankan address as his

domicilium, as did his employer, the SLC. The contract itself stipulates

concerning the terms and obligations, law governing the contract and

provides that the laws of Sri Lanka clearly governed the contract. (Vide-

clause 7.1). The answer to the first question has to be Sri Lanka as the

contract clearly provides that the contract was entered into at Colombo 07,

Sri Lanka.

2. Who is paying the employee and who deducts payments?

[52] In terms of the contract, all fees due to the Player (contract and match

fees etc.) shall be paid by the SLC (clause 4.1, 4.1.3 and 4.2). In terms of

clauses 4.1.4 - 4.16, the SLC is entitled to make deductions referred to in the

said clauses and in terms of clause 4.3, the SLC is entitled to deduct from

any payment due to be made to the player which, it may be advised by its

tax/legal advisers to deduct by reason of the operation of any law.

3.Who the services are being rendered to?

[53] The answer to the third question too has to be the employer, SLC, which

is located in Sri Lanka. The Appellant has agreed and undertaken inter alia:

(i) to represent Sri Lanka at national and other levels if and when called

upon to do so by the SLC (preamble to the Contract);

(ii) play in all matches, including 75% of the provincial tournament

matches for which he has been selected;

25

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

(iii) attend all training sessions, meetings and official functions as

directed by SLC;

(iv) play representative cricket as decided by SLC, represent SLC at

official functions as SLC may direct, and make himself available for

all sponsorship, promotions, including television, radio and other

appearance as required by SLC;

(v) wear such clothing, match-wear and leisure wear as shall be

directed by SLC, both on and off the field, including during the

course of Tours, Matches, practice sessions, pre-match warm-ups,

official and social functions, promotions and other events and

occasions specified by the SLC (vide- clause 3).

[54] It is manifest that the Appellant is rendering services to SLC in terms of the Players Contract and not to any individual or employer or entity located outside Sri Lanka.

4. How the services are being rendered?

[55] The Appellant has agreed to provide his services to SLC by playing matches and representing Sri Lanka at national and international levels and attending functions and events subject to conditions stipulated by SLC in the contract. He has further agreed to provide his aforesaid services to SLC as described in the preamble and clause 3 of the contract.

5. Is the participation of the player in matches a requirement for the purpose of determining that the player rendered services outside Sri Lanka?

[56] The Appellant has claimed that the key requirement for the application

of the exemption under section 8 (1) (j) is the participation in the match

played outside Sri Lanka and thus, where the Appellant has participated in

matches held outside Sri Lanka, his contract fees in US$ component is

exempted under Section 8 (1) (j) of the Act.

[57] It is not in dispute that for the non-participatory nature of deducted

contract fees are paid to a player having a contract with SLC in situations

referred to in clauses 4.14 (non-selection of a player for 6 months or more

due to poor performance), 4.15 (direction of selectors to rest a player due

to no fault of the player) or 4.16 (leave of absence being granted to play

cricket overseas). Conditions in clause 3 of the contract refer to the

conditions such as attending to training sessions, fitness, education,

26

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

anticorruption procedures and complying with rules and regulations codes

of conduct etc. On the other hand, clause 4.12 further provides that in the

event that the contract is terminated by either party before the lapse of the

entirety of the Term, SLC shall pay and the Player shall be entitled to receive

the pro rata portion of the Contract fee for the period during which the

Contract was in force.

[58] The stand of the Appellant is, however, that whenever the player has

been nominated to a squad and he has participated in matches held outside

Sri Lanka, his US Dollar component and the LKR component of fees are both

exempt from income tax on the application of the exemption under Section

8 (1) (j) of the Act whereas the player does not participate in matches, he is

liable to income tax.

[59] The main requirement for the application of the exemption is that the

emoluments earned in foreign currency by a resident in Sri Lanka in respect

of services rendered by him in the course of employment shall be rendered

outside Sri Lanka. In view of this stand, the question is whether the

applicability of Section 8 (1) (j) exemption arises whenever a player who has

participated in matches held outside Sri Lanka and received US$ payment

of the contract fee or match fee from SLC.

Apportionment of Contract Fees and Tax Liability

[60] Mr. De Seram referred to the formula adopted by SLC to determine the

Sri Rupee component of contract fees and the USD component of contract

fees and submitted that SLC has apportioned the contract fee according to

the number of matches played by the Appellant in Sri Lanka and the number

of matches played by the Appellant outside Sri Lanka. He submitted that

therefore, the principle underlying the exemption of contract and match fee

is the participation in the matches played outside Sri Lanka, which falls

within Section 8 (1) (j) of the Act.

[61] The formula followed by the SLC only applies to contract fees and it has

been applied to determine the players annual contract fees for USD and

LKR components according to the number of match days played in Sri

Lanka and number of match days played outside Sri Lanka. It is as follows:

27

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

Total Contract fees

For LKR Payment = X No of match days played in Sri Lanka

Total No. of match days

Total Contract fees

For US $ Payment = .. X No of match days played outside Sri Lanka

Total No. of match days

[62] The purpose of distinguishing matches played in Sri Lanka and overseas

as set out in the SLC formula is an internal formula to determine the contract

fee or match fee in the form of US Dollars component and the Sri Lankan

Rupee component on the basis of match days played in Sri Lanka and

outside Sri Lanka. The internal formula of SLC cannot be used to determine

the tax exemption set out in Section 8 (1) (j) unless it is contained in Section

8 (1) (j) of the Act that the emoluments earned in foreign currency in respect

of services rendered outside Sri Lanka shall be derived from participation

as a resident person in the course of employment carried out by such

person.

[63] The Appellant relies on the formula applied by the SLC to support his

contention that the SLC has apportioned players contract fee according to

the number of match days played by the Appellant in addition to the

fulfilment of the conditions of items 3 of the contract. Conditions in clause 3

of the contract refer to the conditions such as attending to training sessions,

fitness, education, anticorruption procedures and complying with rules and

regulations codes of conduct etc.

[64] In cases where several parts of the composite contract are performed

in different tax jurisdictions, the concept of apportionment may be validly

applied, to determine which fiscal jurisdiction can tax that particular part of

the transaction. This concept helps to determine the capacity to tax an

event, where the territorial jurisdiction of a particular state lies and

composite transactions which have some operations in one territory and

some in others occur.

[65] In the present case, however, the services rendered by the Appellant as

a national player is exclusively for SLC, as his employer representing Sri

Lanka both inside and outside Sri Lanka and the physical activity of the

28

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

Player is intimately connected with one complete contract and thus, the

concept of apportionment on the basis of number of taxable activities that

take place in different jurisdiction has no application.

[66] The question of taxability of the Appellants profits and income in

different jurisdictions will not arise in the present case, as the Players

Contract in question cannot be split up for the purpose of receiving profits

and income from matches played in Sri Lanka and matches outside Sri Lanka

in one complete contract. The payment for different services to be rendered

to SLC by the Appellant either in Sri Lanka or outside Sri Lanka, such as

onshore and offshore services leading to division of profits and income

arising in two tax territories are not clearly demarcated in the contract.

[67] The contract can be held to be a complete contract that has to be read

as a whole and not in parts. Parties were ad idem that there existed no

distinction between any service rendered in two territories irrespective of

the fact some matches are played in Sri Lanka and other outside Sri Lanka

as part of the players contractual obligations in complete transaction. In

other words, the payment of contract fees and match fees in respect of

matches played in Sri Lanka or outside Sri Lanka is based on the fulfilment

of the obligations and the conditions set out in the complete Contract

representing Sri Lanka at national and international matches if and when

called upon to do so by SLC.

[68] Section 2 of the Inland Revenue Act says that income tax shall, subject

to the provisions of the Act, be charged in respect of the profits and income

of every resident person for that year of assessment wherever arising in and

not derived from the carrying on of operations or activities in Sri Lanka. In

the present case, there are no composite transactions in the contract to be

operated in different territories to apportion the profits and income arising

from different operations in different jurisdictions. The contractual

obligations of the players to play matches in Sri Lanka and outside Sri Lanka

cannot be attributed to the different types of operations and services in

different jurisdictions that can create different types of income and profits

between the two services and operations carried on in Sri Lanka and outside

Sri Lanka. If that is the case, it might reasonably be argued that there must

be apportionment of the profits as between the two services and operations

in Sri Lanka and outside Sri Lanka.

29

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

[69] The Appellants income tax in respect of profits or income has arisen

wherever, from one complete employment contract between the employer

(SLC) and employee (Appellant) and the question of appointment of profits

between the matches played in Sri Lanka and outside Sri Lanka does not

arise.

[70] The contract, however, does not set out any condition to the effect that

the receipt of his contract fees by any player having a contract with the SLC

shall be based on the matches played by him either in Sri Lanka or outside

Sri Lanka. There is nothing to indicate in the Players Annual Contract that

the determination of the contract fees or match fees in US$ or LKR

component is based on the number of matches played (participation) by the

player either in Sri Lanka or outside Sri Lanka.

[71] On the contrary, a guideline is already contained in Section 13 (V) of the

Act, which lays down the condition for the applicability of the exemption that

arises where the profits and income of any person or any partnership is

derived from the participation as a competitor, official or organiser of

any sporting or athletic event held in Sri Lanka. There is no statutory

condition whatsoever, in Section 8 (1) (j) that provides that the emoluments

earned by the resident person arising in foreign currency in the course of

employment shall be derived from the participation of such person similar

to the requirement that is available in Section 13 (V) of the Act.

[72] It is settled law that where an exemption is conferred by a statute by

way of any exemption clause, it has to be interpreted strictly in its entirely

and not in parts when the issue relates to the eligibility of an exemption

claimed by an Assessee. A construction of such a provision depends, inter

alia, upon the purpose for which the concession is sought to be granted and

upon the fulfilment of such conditions as may be specified therein. In

Commissioner of Customs (Import), Mumbai v. Dilip Kumar and Company and

Others, Civil Appeal No. 3327 of 2007, decided on 30.07.2018, five judges of

the Indian Supreme Court having considered previous conflicting judgments

of the Supreme Court applied the principles for the interpretation of

exemption clauses in taxation and held at paragraphs 41 and 52 that:

1. Every taxing statue including, charging, computation and exemption

Clause (at the threshold stage) should be interpreted strictly;

30

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

2. The burden of proving the applicability would be on the assessee to

show that his case comes within the parameters of the exemption

clause or exemption notification;

3. In case of ambiguity in a charging provision, the benefit must

necessarily go in favour of subject/assessee, but the same was not true

for an exemption notification wherein the benefit of ambiguity must be

strictly interpreted in favour of the Revenue/State;

4. The ratio in Sun Export Corporation, Bombay v. Collector of Customs

[(1997) 6 SCC 564], the case is not correct and all the decisions which

took a similar view as in Sun Export Corporation, Bombay v. Collector of

Customs (supra) stands over-ruled.

[73] It is well-settled that in order to claim the benefit of a tax concession, a

party who seeks such concession must comply with all the conditions of a

provision and the benefit is not conferred, by stretching or adding words to

the provision. In State Level Committee v. Morgardshammar India Ltd AIR 1966

SC 524, the Indian Supreme Court held that:

..... It must be remembered that no unit has a right to claim exemption from tax as a matter of right. His right is only insofar as it is provided.... While providing for exemption, the Legislature has hedged it with certain conditions. It is not open to the Court to ignore these conditions and extend the exemption.

[74] Any interpretation which would extend the plain terms of the

exemption and confer and unintended benefit on the Asseesse on any

supposed intention of the exempting authority must be rejected. It is settled

that a claim of exemption must fall within the four corners of the exemption

provision (Vidarbha Co-op Marketing Society v. Commissioner of Income Tax

(1985) 156 ITR 422 (Bom.). Thus, an exemption clause cannot be unduly

stretched to produce unintended result in derogation of the plain language

employed therein (Collector of Customs, Bombay v. MI Exports Ltd (2001) 6 SCC

756).

[75] It will appear from the scheme used in the Inland Revenue Act that the

legislature has granted the exemption with a view to encouraging any

resident person to earn emoluments arising in foreign currency by

rendering services outside Sri Lanka in the course of any employment where

31

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

such emolument is paid to him in Sri Lanka or such emoluments are

remitted by him to Sri Lanka.

[76] The internal formula adopted by SLC is only an administrative

arrangement to determine and distribute the US$ and LKR components of

the contract fee according to the number of match days played either in

Sri Lanka or outside Sri Lanka. The formula in question is not part of the

conditions stipulated in the contract for the determination of the contract

fees of the players and thus, the formula can only be regarded as an

internal formula by SLC for the purpose of determination of US$

component and LKR component of contract fees.

[77] It is not a formula to determine the profits and income earned by a

taxpayer from employment income by way of contract fees and match fees

for the purpose of tax liability which is governed solely by the charging

section and deductions and statutory exemptions laid down in the Act.

[78] The internal formula adopted by SLC cannot expand the scope of the

law or cannot create tax liability contrary to the statutory provisions and

thus, it has no existence in the eye of law. The reason is simple. An internal

administrative formula cannot travel beyond the statute. It is not binding on

the tax authorities and courts under the tax statute and such internal

formulas cannot give effect to, in determining the tax liability of the

assessee. It is for the Court to decide what the particular provision of the

statute says and any formula which is contrary to the statutory provisions

has no existence in law.

Payment of Match Fees

[79] The formula adopted by SLC does not apply to match fees as it is

restricted to the determination of the US$ and LKR components of the

contract fees. As noted in paragraph 28 of this judgment, payments other

than contract fees, including match fees are paid to the Player as specified

in Schedule IV of the Contract. There is nothing to indicate in the Players

Contract that the payment of match fee of a Player having contract with SLC

and selected to the national squad, depends solely on the physical

participation of a player in each match, or where he, though in the squad, is

not playing a particular match due to the decision of the team management,

32

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

is not entitled to a match fee in respect of such match held either in Sri Lanka

or outside Sri Lanka.

[80] The Appellants Representative at page 167 of the written submissions

filed on behalf of the Appellant before the Tax Appeals Commission has

conceded that match fees are paid irrespective of whether the players

participated or not in matches depending on circumstances as follows:

Match fees are which are of various types such as test match fees, one day

internationals, 20/20 matches, win bonus, tour fees, captions fees, etc are also paid in addition to contract fees the amount of which is decided for each match and is an amount in US Dollars per match. This is distributed among the players in the squad irrespective of whether they participated or not depending on the circumstances. If the match is played in Sri Lanka, rupee equivalent is paid. The Assessee has also received match fees of different types of which details are included in the summary of payments issued by the Accountant of the SLC (Marked as Documents No. 15, 16 and 17).

[81] It is not in dispute that a player in the playing 11 will be paid a fixed

match fee determined by the SLC as set out in Schedule IV for each match

depending on their ranking or gradings or the format of the match (test, one

day internationals, T 20 etc.) either in US$ when a match is played outside

Sri Lanka and in LKR when a match is played in Sri Lanka. The other players

in the squad who are available to play, but did not play (participate) in that

match due to circumstances such as the condition of the pitch and playing

conditions etc. will also be paid a proportionate lesser match fee as they are

all part of the team and bench strength representing the team (squad). The

match fees for them will also be paid either in US$ when a match is played

outside Sri Lanka and in LKR when a match is played in Sri Lanka.

[82] The payment of match fee of a player in the squad, is not based on the

participation of a player for a particular match as claimed by the Appellant

and each and every member of the squad, who is available to play, is entitled

to a match fee for that particular match, but the amount of the match fee

differs from the format to format, grading of the player and whether a player

is in playing 11. If the player is playing in playing 11, he will be paid a fixed

match fee depending on the aforesaid factors. Where a player is available to

play, but did not play (participate) in the match due to the aforesaid

circumstances, he will also be paid a proportionate lesser match fee.

33

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

[83] Subject to the above-mentioned deductions and grading, a player having a contract with SLC, will be entitled to contract fees set out in clause 4 according to the grading of Players in US$ or LKR components, disregarding the matches played by such player either in Sri Lanka or overseas. Subject to the above-mentioned deductions with regard to the match fees, every member of the squad will also be entitled to a match fee in US$ or LKR components, according to the grading of the Player, disregarding whether he is played by the team management in a match either in Sri Lanka or overseas.

[84] Under such circumstances, I hold that subject to the aforesaid deductions and qualifications, the income earned by the Appellant by way of contract and match fees from SLC under the Players Contract is not solely depended on the playing in a match as claimed by the Appellant for the purpose of the exemption under Section 8 (1) (j) of the Inland Revenue Act.

6.Where the services are being rendered-outside Sri Lanka or in Sri Lanka?

[85] The final element to be considered is where the services are being rendered by the Appellant, whether in Sri Lanka or outside Sri Lanka. In terms of the Contract between the SLC and the Appellant, the SLC has agreed to provide the facilities to improve his skill and ability and develop his potential on the condition that he shall be available to represent Sri Lanka (page 1 of the contract). The SLC has agreed to raise finance from various funding sources to provide such facilities to the Appellant and the Appellant has agreed to represent Sri Lanka if and when called upon to do so by the SLC (clause 3).

[86] In terms of the Players Contract, the Appellant was contracted to represent Sri Lanka at national and international levels if and when called upon to do so by the SLC and the Appellant has agreed to represent Sri Lanka whenever called upon to do so by SLC. The relevant portions of the agreement at pages 1-2 are reproduced below for clarity:

Whereas the Player has gained recognition in Sri Lanka as a Cricketer of talent, ability and skill with the potential to represent Sri Lanka at national and other levels and has been recommended by the National Selectors to be fit to be given a contract by SLC upon terms and conditions hereinafter set out and Whereas SLC has decided to afford the Player with facilities to improve his skill and ability and develop his potential provided that the player shall keep

34

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

himself free and available to represent Sri Lanka at national and other levels if and when called upon to do so by the SLC, and

Whereas the Player has agreed with SLC to avail himself of such facilities as may be provided by the SLC and to keep himself available to represent Sri Lanka whenever called upon to do so by SLC, and

Whereas the monies required by SLC to avail the said facilities to the Player and to other cricketers who will be similarly engaged by SLC are raised by SLC from various sources (hereinafter referred to as the financiers) and ..

Whereas SLC and the Player has agreed to execute a written Agreement specifying all of the terms and conditions upon which SLC shall provide such facilities to the Player and the Player shall keep himself available to represent Sri Lanka as aforementioned if and when called upon to do so by SLC.

[87] The income earned by the Appellant representing Sri Lanka is Sri Lanka-sourced income and the services were rendered by the Appellant as employee to his employer, SLC, irrespective of the fact that the Appellant physically performed what was contractually bound by him to do so outside Sri Lanka (physical activity) as and when called upon to do so by SLC. SLC being the employer of the Appellant has made the payments in the form of contract fees and match fees in USD currency where matches were held outside Sri Lanka and in Sri Lankan Rupees where the matches were held in Sri Lanka.

[88] The nature of the services he rendered either inside or outside Sri Lanka are set out in the contract with the Appellants employer and there is no suggestion in the contract that the Appellant acted beyond the scope of his employment. The source of the remuneration is the employment income and the source of employment through ICC sanctioned international matches (home and abroad) or provincial matches are arranged by SLC, which is the official body responsible for the governance of the sport of cricket in Sri Lanka, being a member of the International Cricket Council (clause 4.1.6).

[89] The Appellant having a contract with SLC rendered services to the employer, SLC, which exists in SL and not to any person or entity located outside Sri Lanka. The source of employment income is located at the place where the services are rendered by the Appellant to SLC and the services rendered by the Appellant to SLC could be regarded as the employees duties in Sri Lanka representing Sri Lanka in terms of the contract with SLC.

35

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

In the present case, there is no foreign employment in relation to that income by way of an employment contract with the foreign employer by the Appellant who was required to render any service to any foreign employer.

[90] The Appellant being an employee of SLC and as the representative of

the employer (SLC), has rendered services to SLC, both in Sri Lanka and

outside Sri Lanka and his physical activity of performing contract during the

Term of the contract outside Sri Lanka is part and parcel of the Contract with

SLC which exists in Sri Lanka. Thus, he has to travel abroad representing SLC

from time to time and render services in the nature of playing matches for

SLC, which is necessarily the same services rendered to the SLC in Sri Lanka.

The Appellant has received emoluments for performing the physical activity

outside Sri Lanka in the course of employment with SLC from a source of

employment arranged by SLC through ICC sanctioned matches and such

emoluments were received in respect of services rendered for or on behalf

of his employer, SLC.

[91] There is a sufficiently close connection between the Appellant and the

SLC for rendering the service outside Sri Lanka representing Sri Lanka at

international matches and the employment contract, to interpret the

rendering of the services for Sri Lanka is no more than a contractual

obligation by the Appellant to his employer, the SLC. The emoluments are

received by the Appellant from his employer (SLC), in the course of

employment at ICC sanctioned international matches which only occur upon

the rendering of his duty-bound services to SLC whether outside or inside

Sri Lanka. The source of the remuneration (employment) received by the

Appellant for rendering services to his employer, SLC outside Sri Lanka is the

same source from which remuneration was received by him from SLC inside

Sri Lanka at ICC sanctioned international matches.

[92] As per the terms of the contract with SLC, the Appellant was under full

contract of SLC and he had no choice or option to refuse the contractual

obligations to play matches played in Sri Lanka or outside Sri Lanka, which

is decided, not by the Appellant but by SLC. The Appellant is under an

obligation to follow all the directions of SLC, including (i) wearing such

clothing, match-wear and leisure wear, in such manner and at such time as

shall be directed by SLC both on and off the field; (ii) but not limited to during

the course of tours, matches, practice sessions, pre-match warm ups, official

36

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

functions, social functions, promotions and any other events or occasions

specified by SLC from time to time and as per applicable ICC regulations

(clause 3.1.h).

[93] Under the contract, he cannot play any cricket match or competition,

whether in Sri Lanka or elsewhere the playing in which match or competition

does not fall within the Players obligations arising without the prior express

written approval of SLC. He cannot enter into any negotiations and/or

contracts or agreements with any third party or parties to play cricket

without prior express written approval of SLC (3.1.l). On the other hand, the

Appellant cannot take part in any form of cricket, if he is rested by the

selectors (3.1.r).

[94] It is manifest that under the contract, even the time and place of playing

matches and their remunerations including contract and match fees,

seniority fees, tour fees, and all other fees are decided by SLC. Under the

contract, the Appellant was not providing any service as any independent

worker and the status of the Appellant was that of an employee rather than

an independent worker. Under the contract, the Appellant was simply a

contracted employee of SLC and is a representative of SLC and working

under SLC and thus, he is merely providing services to SLC as and when

required by SLC which is located in Sri Lanka.

[95] In the present case, the Appellant has rendered services to SLC, which

is located in the territory of Sri Lanka and is the beneficiary or recipient of

services. The service provider and the recipient of services are located in Sri

Lanka and services are rendered to SLC which is located in Sri Lanka. No

services are rendered by the Appellant to any other beneficiary outside Sri

Lanka. The words services rendered outside Sri Lanka cannot be simply

referred to a foreign country without identifying the person to whom the

services are rendered in the course of employment of the Appellant.

[96] Where the remuneration is earned for these services rendered by the

Appellant under a complete contract with SLC will be taxed in Sri Lanka as

the source of employment income is located at the place where the services

under the contract are rendered to the SLC in Sri Lanka. This means that the

source or originating cause of income from employment arises in Sri Lanka

in terms of the contract with SLC. Thus, the services are rendered by the

Appellant to SLC, which exists in Sri Lanka, irrespective of the place where

37

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

the activity is physically performed outside Sri Lanka as he was bound to do

so under his employment contract with SLC.

[97] The originating cause or source of the income in question was the contract of employment entered in Sri Lanka under which the Appellant was bound to render services to SLC as a national cricketer and the services were rendered by the Appellant representing Sri Lanka to his Sri Lanka employer, namely, the SLC. The place where the services were physically performed i.e. outside Sri Lanka, is only a place at which he is bound to perform his duty as an employee of the SLC in terms of the Contract.

[98] In my view the rendering of the services was no more than contractual

performance by the taxpayer to the Sri Lankan employer (SLC) located in Sri

Lanka and the source of the income earned during the foreign tour in the

course of employment was no different to the source of the income earned

by the Appellant for services rendered in Sri Lanka as the representative of

SLC. It is a reciprocal obligation or arrangement between the Appellant and

SLC irrespective whether certain matches are physically performed (played)

in Sri Lanka and others are performed outside Sri Lanka.

[99] So, the Appellant is liable to income tax in Sri Lanka if the employment income in foreign currency received by him arises from services rendered to his employer, the SLC which exists in Sri Lanka. Thus, the income earned is treated as Sri Lankan-sourced income and the place at which the services were rendered shall be the territory of Sri Lanka for the purpose of the tax liability whether the physical activity was itself performed in respect of some matches played outside of Sri Lanka, as he is bound by the contract as the representative of SLC.

[100] Accordingly, the contract fees and matches fees paid to the Appellant

for services rendered to the SLC in respect of matches held overseas in the

course of his employment under the contract with SLC is not exempted from

income tax under Section 8 (1) (j) of the Inland Revenue Act.

Exemption under Section 13 (v) of the Act

[101] The next question is to consider whether the Appellant is entitled to the benefit of the exemption under section 13 (v) of the Inland Revenue Act whenever, he has derived profits and income from the participation as a

38

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

competitor of cricket event held in Sri Lanka with the participation of any competitor outside Sri Lanka.

[102] Section 13 (v) of the Act reads as follows:

The profit and income of any person, any partnership derived from the participation as a competitor, official or organiser of any sporting or athletic event held in Sri Lanka and at which competitor from outside Sri Lanka participates.

[103] It seems that the legislative intent in granting the exemption under

Section 13 (v) is to promote the Sri Lankan sporting and athletic events held

in Sri Lanka with the participation of foreign competitors by exempting any

competitor, official or organiser of any sporting or athletic events of their

income derived from their individual participation in such sporting or

athletic events held in Sri Lanka.

[104] Where the exemption in section 13 (v) clearly provides that the participation in any sporting or athletic event is a condition precedent for the applicability of the exemption under section 13 (v), non-participation is a disqualification for the applicability of the exemption. As section 13 (v) applies to the income derived only from the individual participation of such event held in Sri Lanka and thus, the match fees paid to the Appellant for playing matches held in Sri Lanka with his participation with foreign competitors are exempt from income tax.

[105] There is no dispute that the Appellant was a competitor of many sporting event (matches) involving foreign teams and that he received payments in Sri Lankan Rupees in respect of matches played in Sri Lanka with foreign competitors with their participation. The Appellant has clearly derived profits and income from the participation as a competitor of cricket matches held in Sri Lanka and at which competitors from outside Sri Lanka participated.

Payments received as match fees in respect of tournaments held in Sri Lanka with or without foreign competitors

[106] The Assessor has, however, regarded the payment received as match fees in respect of tournaments held in Sri Lanka, where the players are from other countries are exempted under section 13 (v) of the Inland Revenue Act. However, the Assessor has stated that the match fees received from

39

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

provincial matches played in Sri Lanka are made liable to tax. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue in confirming the assessment issued by the Assessor in his reasons for the Determination of Appeals has made the following observations at pages 52 and 53 of the Tax Appeals Commission brief:

Payments made as match fees

When the assessment has been made by the Assessor, he has considered the payments received as match fees in respect of tournaments in Sri Lanka, where the players are from other countries and exempted under section 13 (v) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006, whereas the match fees received from provincial matches played in Sri Lanka were made liable to tax

[107] The Respondent has detailed the match fees exempted and not exempted under section 13 (v) of the Act for the following three assessment periods (p. 275 of the Tax Appeals Commission brief):

[108] The above-mentioned table clearly indicates that the payments

received by the Appellant as match fees in respect of matches played in Sri

Lanka with a foreign competitor is an income derived by the Appellant from

participation as a competitor and therefore, such match fees are exempted

from income tax under section 13 (v) of the Inland Revenue Act as correctly

determined by the Assessor.

Provincial Matches Played in Sri Lanka

[109] As noted, the contract fees paid to the Appellant in respect of the

matches played in Sri Lanka are not determined on the basis of the number

of matches played by the Appellant in Sri Lanka and therefore, the contract

fees paid to the Appellant in respect of matches played in Sri Lanka do not

fall within the purview of the exemption under Section 13 (V) of the Inland

Revenue Act. However, the match fees received by the Appellant from

provincial matches played in Sri Lanka do not involve foreign competitors

and such match fees do not fall within the scope of the exemption under

Section 13 (v) of the Inland Revenue Act as correctly decided by the Assessor.

[110] I hold that the payments received by the Appellant as match fees in

respect of matches held in Sri Lanka with the participation of foreign

competitors are exempt from income tax under Section 13 (v) whereas the

match fees received by the Appellant from provincial matches played in Sri

Lanka are liable for income tax as correctly decided by the Assessor,

Respondent and the Tax Appeals Commission.

41

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

Payment of USD 15000 (Rs. 1,609,500/) and the Exemption under

Section 13 (f) of the Inland Revenue Act

[111] The final issue is whether the sum of Rs 1,609,500/- which is

mentioned in the schedule for the year of assessment 2008/2009 is covered

by the exemption under Section 13 (f) of the Inland Revenue Act. Section 13

(f) reads as follows:

There shall be exempt from income tax-

Any capital sum received by way of death gratuity or as compensation for death or injuries.

[112] The Assessor regarded the said payment as part of the Appellants

employment contract and accordingly, included the said amount in the

assessment as income from employment received from SLC. It was the

position of the Respondent before the Tax Appeals Commission that the

said payment was part of the contract fee and thus, it was not paid as

compensation for the injury suffered by the Appellant (p. 335). The Tax

Appeals Commission stated that the payment of Rs. 1,609,500/- will not fall

under Section 13 (f) of the Inland Revenue Act and the said payment was

made to a rest player for loss of income due to the non-participation in

matches as a result of ankle injury. It reads at p. 335 as follows:

However, it is clear from the letter dated 09.08.2008 written by the Secretary SLC to the Chief Executive Officer of SLC and the reply sent, that the payment made to the Appellant, Lasith Malinga was not compensation for the injury he suffered, but it was a payment made to give him support for the loss of income, due to his non-participation in matches as a result of the ankle injury. Therefore, the capital sum paid to the Appellant was not to compensate him in respect of the ankle injury suffered, but it was to compensate him for the loss of income. Hence, it was a payment made to a rest player. Therefore, this payment of Rs. 1,609,500/- will not fall under Section 13 (f) of the Inland Revenue Act, and it is liable for income tax.

[113] At the hearing Mr. De Seram submitted that the payment of Rs.

1,609,500/- was a capital sum paid to the Appellant by SLC as compensation

for his ankle injury sustained by him while playing cricket for SLC and

therefore, the said payment attracts the exemption under Section 13 (v) of

the Inland Revenue Act. He submitted that the compensation paid to the

42

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

Appellant was a personal payment on account of his injuries while playing

cricket for SLC and thus, it cannot be regarded as profits or income within

the meaning of Section 2 of the Inland Revenue Act.

[114] On the other hand, the learned Senior State Counsel submitted that

the sole purpose of the letter sent by the Cricketers Association dated

09.08.2008 to SLC was to seek a new contract from SLC as SLC unfairly

denied a contract to the Appellant due to ankle injury and thus, the said

payment of USD 15,000 was made by SLC as an incentive and motivate the

Appellant in the wake of the termination of the contract and his attempt to

seek a central contract from SLC. He further submitted that the Appellant

was insured by SLC with a comprehensive surgical and hospitalisation cover

and he received compensation for ankle injury pursuant to the said

Insurance Policy. He submitted that under such circumstances, the payment

of USD 15,000 cannot be classified as compensation received by the

Appellant for injuries as envisaged by Section 13 (f).

[115] In view of the submissions of the parties, two important questions that

arise and relate to the questions of law bearing Nos. 1 and 4 are:

1. Whether the sum of USD 15,000 (Rs. 1,609,500/) was granted by the

SLC to the Appellant as compensation for injuries sustained by the

Appellant and if so, whether it is covered by the Exemption under

Section 13 (f) of the Inland Revenue Act;

2. If not, whether the sum of USD 15,000 (Rs. 1,609,500/) that was

granted by the SLC to the Appellant was an emolument paid to him

as an inducement or advance to enter into a contract of employment

and if so, whether it was as income accrued to him from employment

assessable to tax under Section 4 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act.

Capital Sum

[116] According to Cambridge English Dictionary, a capital sum generally

means the amount of money paid at one time rather than

a series of payments, for example by an insurance company in an

insurance policy (e.g., capital sum if death occurs or injury during the life of

the policy) or on an investment or a gift for damage. The question whether

a receipt is capital receipt or revenue income depends on the facts of the

43

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

particular case as no single test as infallible or no single criterion as decisive

in the determination of the question can be formulated (Commissioner of

Income Tax v. Rai Bahadur Jairam Valji and others, 1959 AIR 291). The question

whether the payment of US$ 15,000/- was of a capital or revenue nature

must ultimately be decided on the facts of the particular case.

Compensation

[117] The expression 'compensation' by itself connotes some payment to

make up certain losses suffered by the person getting the compensation

and thus, if no loss is suffered, no question of receiving compensation

arises. The Compact Oxford Reference Dictionary, 2001 defines

compensation as: "something given to compensate for the loss, suffering or

injury. Blacks Law Dictionary defines compensation in the following terms:

Payment of damages or any other act that a Court orders to be done by a person who has caused injury to another and must make the other whole.

[118] Therefore, compensation is the concept of indemnification, in the

sense that it, more fully and completely indemnifies a person against any

loss or damage or suffering or injury. This may include loss of injuries, death,

loss of revenue (income) or loss of office or employment or loss of damages

etc. It must be mentioned that, for the purposes of the Act, it is not necessary

for a payment to amount to compensation that the recipient be entitled to

it under the law. The principles that apply to the determination of the

damages in civil suit will not apply to the determination of the compensation

for loss of office, employment or injury under the assessment of taxable

income under the Inland Revenue Act.

[119] Nevertheless, the use of the word compensation in a document

authorising payment by a payer in his own selection is not decisive and can

be misleading. It cannot be necessarily assumed that it was either an income

(which is liable to income tax) or capital (which not assessable to income

tax), in the hands of the assessee. The question whether a payment is a

capital payment or a revenue payment solely depends on the facts and

circumstances of the particular case

Income

44

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

[120] Mr. De Seram referred to the decision in Thornhill v. The Commissioner

of Income Tax, Reports of Ceylon Tax Cases Vol. 1, to support his submission

that the payment of Rs. 1,609,500/- (US$ 15,000) paid to the Appellant does

not fall within the characteristics of income in Section 3 of the Inland

Revenue Act and therefore, the said payment is not liable to income tax. In

Thornhill v. The Commissioner of Income Tax (supra), the main question was

whether the sum of Rs. 19,622.19 was received by the Appellant in respect

of his estate under the Tea and Rubber Control Ordinance as tea and rubber

coupons to which he was entitled under the said Ordinance, and realised by

the sale of these coupons constituted profit or income within the meaning

of Section 6 (1) (a) or 6 (1) (b), or whether it represented realisation of capital.

[121] Soertsz, J. in that case referred to the statement made in Tennant v.

Smith (1892) A.C. 150 that for income tax purposes, income must be

money or something capable of being turned into money. But, Soertsz, J.

held however, that this statement needs qualification as all money and all

things capable of being turned into money are not necessarily income for

tax purposes. Soertsz, J. referred to the following essential characteristics

of income identified by Cunningham and Dowland in their Treatise on Land

and Income Tax and Practice, at p. 128 and held that these essential

elements provide adequate tests by which to ascertain whether a particular

receipt is income or not within the meaning of the Income Tax Ordinance

(a) It must be a gain;

(b) It must actually come in, severed from capital, in cash or its

equipment;

(c) It must be either the produce of property or/and the reward of

labour or effort;

(d) It must not be a mere change in the form of, or accretion to, the value

of articles in which it is not the business of the taxpayer to deal; and

(e) It must not be a sum returned as a reduction of a private expense.

[122] Having applied the above-mentioned tests, Soertsz, J. held inter alia,

that (i) the amount in question is profits and income derived from the

business of an agricultural undertaking, and is therefore assessable under

section 6 (1) (a); (ii) if it does not fall within the scope of section 6 (1) (a), it is

45

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

caught up by the residuary subsection 6 (1) (h) as this is not something

causal or something in the nature of a windfall. No doubt, these elements

provide adequate tests by which to ascertain whether a particular receipt is

income receipt or capital receipt, and if it is an income receipt, whether it

attracts the exemption under Section 13 (f) as claimed by the Appellant.

Profits from Employment

[123] Now the first question is whether upon the facts and the circumstances of the case, the payment of USD 15,000 received by the Appellant from SLC can be classified as compensation for injuries as envisaged by Section 13 (f) of the Inland Revenue Act.

[124] In view of the five tests laid down in Thornhill v. The Commissioner of

Income Tax, (supra), there can be no question that the payment in question

represents a gain and the payment has actually come in, the sense, it has

reached the hands of the Appellant, in the form of cash. But in his return,

the Appellant has shown it as non-taxable income. With regard to other

elements, Mr. De Seram submitted that as the payment was a special

payment, it was similar to a personal gift granted to the Appellant to

compensate him for the injury which prevented the Appellant from playing

in matches for a considerable length of time. He strongly relied on the case

in Craib v Commissioner of Income Tax, (supra) in support of his contention.

[125] In Craib v Commissioner of Income Tax, (supra), the Appellant who was

a Superintendent of Estate had contracted amoebic dysentery whilst in his

employers employment and it was said that he had contracted the illness

due to his employment. The Appellant was granted a special bonus of Rs.

10,000/- by his employers having considered his exceptional services to the

Company and in consideration of the fact that he has to undergo medical

treatment while at home.

[126] The Appellant claimed to exempt this sum of Rs. 10,000/- as a taxable

income on the ground, inter alia, that (i) it was not profits or income under

Section 6 (2) (a) of the Income Tax Ordinance; (ii) the said sum of Rs. 10,000/-

was not a bonus or gratuity, but was a voluntary gift proceeding from

goodwill, without any obligation on his employers part to pay any such sum;

(iii) it was prompted by the fact that the Appellant was ill and needed special

treatment and that it was a gratitude for the Appellants good services; and

46

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

(iv) it was a consolidated compensation for injuries that falls under Section

7 (1) (k) of the Ordinance.

[127] Accordingly, the Appellant argued that the sum of Rs. 10,000/- was a personal gift on personal grounds, for a particular purpose, namely, to provide for a holiday and to enable the Appellant to recuperate his health. The Assessor however, refused his application and included this sum as a part of his income on the ground that the payment was a gratuity or bonus within the meaning of Section 6 (2) (a) which was wide enough to include all voluntary payments of whatsoever nature and that the reason for payment or the object to which it is to be applied is immaterial.

[128] The Board of Review dismissed the Appeal holding that the said sum

was a bonus or gratuity under Section 6 (2) (a) and that it was not exempt

from taxation under Section 7 (1) (k) of the Ordinance. The point for decision

was whether the payment to the Appellant can be regarded as profits from

any employment within the meaning of Section 6 (2) (a) of the Ordinance

[129] Allowing the Appeal, the Supreme Court held that (i) the payment of Rs. 10,000/- was a personal gift and could not be regarded as profits from any employment within the meaning of Section 6 (2) (a) of the Income Tax Ordinance; and (ii) the long service rendered by the appellant to the Commissioner was the motive, but not the consideration, for the payment. Rejecting the arguments of the Respondent that the guiding factor should be the actual word special bonus used in the resolution authorising the payment, the Court held that the Appellant should not be penalised for the choice of a word special bonus, whether it be deliberate or accidental, by the party making the payment.

General Principles

[130] Before embarking upon a discussion on the applicability of the said

judgment to the facts of this case and the exemption under Section 13 (f), it

is necessary to refer to the general principles that are applicable to the

determination of the nature of payment received by the Appellant to be

treated as income chargeable to tax.

(i) Nature and quality of payment

[131] The test is that in determining whether this payment amounts to a

return for loss of income or profits or gains liable to income tax, one must

have regard to the nature and quality of the payment. The relevance must

47

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

be attached to the nature of the receipt in the hands of the person who

receives the payment.

(ii) Extent of the Payment or words used in documents used by the

payer

[132] The other principle is that as a general rule, the fact that the amount

involved was large or small or that it is described as pay or remuneration

or bonus (Crab v. Commissioner of Income Tax, (supra), or compensation

etc. has no decisive nature in determining the quality of the payment

received by the recipient.

(iii) Periodicity of the payment

[133] The other principle is that as a general rule, the periodicity of the

payment does not make the payment a recurring income. To constitute

income, profits or gains, however, there must be some source from which

the payment in question must arise and connection must clearly exist

between the receipt of the payment and the source. If the payment was not

received to compensate for a loss of office or employment, such payment

cannot properly be described as income or profits or gains as commonly

understood within the meaning of Section 4 (1). On the other hand, if the

payment was received to compensate for a loss of profits or income in the

hands of the Appellant, such payment can properly be described as income,

profits or gains liable for tax.

(iv) Relevancy of Motive or intention of the contributors

[134] As to the contention that the motives or intention of the contributors,

SLC is a relevant factor to decide the nature of the payment, it must be

noted that the character or nature of the payment received cannot be solely

determined in the choice of a word, whether it be deliberate or accidental,

by the party making the payment (Crab v. Commissioner of Income Tax,

(supra). It would be thus, unfair to bind the Assessee to the strict meaning

of words authorizing the payment, which cannot be described as a special

payment, gift or income or profits within the meaning of Section 2 or 4 of

the Act.

(v) Voluntary payments made by reason of office or employment.

48

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

[135] The other principle is to consider whether the receipt can be

described as income or profits from office or employment, or whether it is

a capital payment as compensation for injuries under section 13 (f) or an

addition to the remuneration for loss of earnings that fall within the

meaning of section 4 (1).

Application of General Principles

[136] The first test as described, would be to decide the question: what was

the quality of the payment from the point of view of the recipient? The

nature or quality of payment cannot be decided on the basis of the words

selected by the payer at his "whims and fancies" which cannot bind the

payee (supra). The reason is that the nature or quality of the payment may

vary according to the circumstances (Commissioner of Income Tax,

Hyderabad-deccan vs. Vazir Sultan and Sons (1959 AIR 814). It must be,

however, noted that in trying to ascertain the quality of the receipt of the

payment (proper payment) and arriving at the proper conclusion, what the

parties intended the sum to represent can be taken into consideration (The

Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay v. E.D. Sheppard, decided on:

12.12.1962 Civil Appeal No. 527 of 1961).

[137] The justification of this proposition is simple. It may not be possible

to assess the quality of the payment without considering the different

positions of the payer and of the payee. The ascertainment of the

respective positions of the payee, for example, may help the payee to show

that the payment granted was not what is stated in strict words used by the

payer but it may well be that it was made for some entirely different

account.

Whether the ankle injury occurred during the period of the Contract

[138] In the application of these principles, the first question is whether

the ankle injury occurred during the period of the Players Contract

between the Appellant and the SLC. It is not in dispute that the Appellant

as an outstanding and a skilful national cricketer who represented Sri

Lanka both as a test, ODIs and T-20 cricket upon a contract offered by SLC.

It is also not in dispute that the Term of contract between the Player and

SLC was for a period of 1 year commencing on the first day of March each

year and ending on the 28th day of February of the following year.

49

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

According to the documents available in the Tax Appeals Commission brief,

the Appellant was contracted to SLC during the periods from 01.03.2006 to

28.02.2007 (pp 23-39), 01.03.2007 to 28.02.2008 (pp 151/224), 01.03.2008

to 28.02.2009 (298-314), 01.03.2009 to 28.02.2010 and 01.03.2010 to

28.02.2011.

[139] As per the letter of the Cricketers Association (pp. 151/224), the

Appellant was having a contract with SLC for the period from 01.03.2007 to

28.02.2008 and the said contract expired on 28.02.2008. The said payment

of US$ 15,000 was made by SLC in response to the letter dated 09.08.2008

sent by the Secretary of the Cricketers Association to SLC, which reflects

the purpose of the request made to SLC from the point of the Appellant.

It reads as follows:

09.08.2008

Mr. Duleep Mendis, Chief Executive Officer, Sri Lanka Cricket, 37, Maitland Place, Colombo 12.

Dear Duleep, Re: Lasith Malinga Central Contract

We write to express our concern that the recent decision taken by SLC to not to award a contract to Lasith Malinga is unfair considering his outstanding contribution to Sri Lanka during the last contract period from 1 March 2007 to 29 Feb 2008.

During the last contract period from March 2007 to Feb 2008, Lasith was an outstanding performer in Sri Lanka. He was one of the stars of ICC World Cup, taking 10 wickets in 8 matches and claiming a world record with four consecutive wickets. He was rated the 17th best bowler in the world in March 2008 when the SLC contract expired and last year, he claimed 40 ODI wickets in 25 one-day internationals at 24.22 and 20 wickets in seven Tests.

His fitness record since making his debut has been excellent. This is his major injury Lasith has suffered in three-and-half years. Indeed, in the last year, he played more ODIs (25 out of a maximum of 30) than any other Sri Lanka bowler. For three out of the five matches he was available for selection but was rested. He missed just two games in the entire year because of an ankle injury.

50

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

Wed like to stress that Lasith was injured while representing Sri Lanka. As a result of that injury, he has already lost match fees and tour payments that in other countries like England and Australia that cover lost earnings for two years, he would be insured against.

Our concern is that the decision to not offer Lasith a contract is not only unfair, but it could lead to disillusionment and disappointment at a time when he needs support and care from Sri Lanka Cricket. We need to protect and look after match-winners like Lasith or we risk losing their unique talents forever.

We urge you to request that the Interim Committee to reassess at their decision not to award Lasith a central contract and consider instead what can be done to help get him back playing as soon as possible.

After all, he did play for the country up to 02 days prior to the renewal of the new contract, which was in March 2008.

Graeme La Brooy, Secretary

[140] I shall now examine letter sent by SLC to the Cricketers Association

authorising the payment of US$ 15,000 to the Appellant in order to

ascertain the motive that prompted SLC in authorising the said payment.

It reads as follows:

19.09.2008

Mr. Graeme La Brooy, Secretary, Sri Lankan Cricketers Association Taj Samudra Hotel, 25, Galle Face Centre Road, Colombo 03. Dear Graeme, Lasith Malinga Central Contract This refers to your letter dated 09.08.08 re subject captioned above. The interim Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket at its meeting held on 16.09.08 noted the contents of your letter and decided to compensate Lasith Malinga by affording him US$ 15,000/-.

51

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

Thank you, Yours Sincerely.

Duleep Mendis Chief Executive

[141] The wording of the letter issued by SLC, refers to a compensation of

US$ 15,000/- without describing the purpose or object to which it was

granted. Superficially, the choice of wording in not referring to the purpose

and object of the payment in specific terms, may be deliberate or

accidental by SLC that authorised the payment. It seems, however, that

the words used in the SLC letter The Interim Committee of Sri Lanka

Cricket at its meeting held on 16.09.08 noted the contents of your letter

are self-explanatory.

[142] As noted, the language used in a document is not decisive and the

question has to be determined by a consideration of all the attending

circumstances described in paragraphs 126-131. Nevertheless, the

language cannot be ignored altogether, but must be taken into

consideration along with other relevant circumstances.

[143] As indicated in the letter of the Cricketers Association, the Cricketers

Association has admitted the following crucial matters relevant to this

case:

1. The Appellant was under a contract of employment with SLC for the

period commencing from 01.03.2007 to 28.02.2008 and the said

contract expired on 28.02.2008.

2. The Appellant played more than 25 ODIs out of maximum 30 and for

three out of the remaining five matches and he was available for

selection, but was rested by the selectors and thus, he missed two

matches due to an ankle injury occurred during the contract period

from 01.03.2007 to 28.02.2008;

3. As a result of the injury, he has lost match fees and tour payments

and in other countries like England and Australia, such lost earnings

are covered for two years by insurance policies;

52

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

4. The Appellant did play a match for 2 days prior to the renewal date

of the new contract on 01.03.2008.

[144] It is manifest that the Appellant had a contract of employment with

the SLC from 01.03.2007 to 28.02.2008 and that the Appellant was injured

while playing cricket during the said period from 01.03.2007 to 28.02.2008.

The Cricketers Association has admitted in the said letter that out of five

matches, the Appellant was available for selection for three matches, but

as he was rested, he missed two matches in the entire year (from

01.03.2007 to 28.02.2008) because of an ankle injury. It seems that the

Appellant was not selected for few matches due to an ankle injury and

admittedly, he lost match fees and tour fees during that period.

Purpose of the letter of the Cricketers Association

[145] As noted, the contract for the period from 01.03.2007 to 28.02.2008

expired on 28.02.2008 and thereafter, the Appellant by letter dated

09.08.2009 sought to secure a new central contract from SLC as indicated

in the letter of the Cricketers Association. Mr. De Seram however, relied

on the following words of the letter sent by the Cricketers Association to

SLC to indicate that the Appellant sought compensation for ankle injury:

and consider instead what can be done to help get back playing as soon

as possible.

[146] It is crystal clear that the said letter including the words referred to

by Mr. De Seram does not indicate whatsoever, that the Appellant sought

any compensation from SLC for injuries sustained by him and his motive

was clearly to secure a new contract with SLC. Had he intended to claim

compensation for injuries from SLC, he could have easily asked for the

same in the said letter sent by the Cricketers Association to SLC.

[147] Mr. De Seram further relied on the letter issued by SLC on 18.09.2017

(p. 222) to contend that the said letter supports the position of the

Appellant that SLC has admitted that the Appellant obtained medical

treatment in Australia for his ankle injury sustained while playing cricket

during the period 2008 to 2009. The fact that the Appellant sustained an

ankle injury and received treatment in Australia is not disputed in the

present case. A perusal of the said letter issued by SLC at the request of

53

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

the Appellant on 18.09.2017 however, reveals that this letter had been

issued by SLC after a period of almost 9 years after the payment in

question was made by SLC. There is nothing to indicate in the Tax Appeals

Commission brief that the Appellant sought compensation for injuries

from SLC at or about the time the payment in question was made by SLC.

[148] Mr. De Seram brought to our attention the section of the Manual of

Income Tax issued by the Inland Revenue Department, which refers to the

taxability of medical expenses met or incurred by an employer. He argued

that the said Manual of Income Tax supports the position of the Appellant

that the Appellant is entitled to claim the exception under Section 13 (f) of

the Inland Revenue Act. The relevant section reads as follows:

Medical benefits

Medical expenses met or reimbursed by an employer are profits from employment, unless such expenses were incurred on account of injuries sustained by an employee in the course of carrying out his duties.

Where an employer makes periodic contributions on behalf of an employee to a medical or health insurance scheme the value of the benefits is the amount of the contribution made each year. Where the employer makes a block contribution on behalf of all the employees, an employee is assessed on the actual amount of the expenses reimbursed under the scheme.

[149] As the learned Senior State Counsel brought to our attention, the

contract clearly provides that SLC shall insure the Player and shall provide

the Player with a copy of the relevant policy as set out in clause 5.3 of the

Contract (p. 302). It reads as follows:

5.3 Insurance

The SLC shall insure the Player and shall provide the Player with a copy of

the relevant policy in Schedule V annexed hereto.

[150] It is not in dispute that the Appellant being a national player having

a contract with SLC was insured by SLC with a comprehensive surgical and

hospitalization cover and therefore, he was entitled to receive

compensation for his ankle injury and hospitalisation charges while being

treated in Australia. Had he not received any compensation for his ankle

54

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

injury and hospitalisation charges either in Sri Lanka or in Australia, from

the insurance policy, he could have easily informed SLC in the letter dated

09.08.2008 that he had not received any compensation in terms of the

Insurance Policy. The Appellant never disputed at the hearing that he was

not entitled to receive compensation from the insurance policy or that he

never received any payment from the insurance policy for his ankle injury

and hospitalisation charges in Australia.

[151] Under such circumstances, I am not inclined to agree with the

submission of Mr. De Seram that the purpose of the letter sent by the

Cricketers Association was to seek compensation from SLC in respect of

injuries sustained by the Appellant.

Whether the Payment was an income accrued to the Appellant from

Employment

[152] It was also contended on behalf of the Appellant that the payment

granted by SLC could not be regarded as a payment in consideration of

services rendered to SLC under a contract of employment and therefore,

it cannot be held to be assessable. The next question is to decide whether

the payment in question was an income accrued to the Appellant from

employment with SLC. The question whether or not the payment received

by the Appellant was part of his contract of employment depends on the

facts and circumstances of the case.

[153] As noted in paragraph 31, Section 4 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act,

which relates to profits from any employment is not limited to profits

received in the course of employment. This Section applies to a payment

made in respect of past services or future services as well. It therefore

applies to an emolument which is paid as an inducement to enter into a

future contract of employment and to perform services in the future. This

is consistent with the analysis that an emolument which is derived from

being an employee or becoming an employee (Shilton v. Wilmshurst (HM

Inspector of Taxes) (1991) BTC 66, at p. 4)).

[154] The result is that where an emolument is paid to, for being or

becoming an employee in respect of past services or as an inducement to

enter into employment and provide future services, then the emolument

55

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

is received from the employment. On the other hand, if an emolument is

not paid as a reward for such past or as an inducement to enter into

employment and provide future services, but for some other reason, such

emolument does not receive from the employment (supra).

[155] In this context, the question is from the standpoint of the Appellant

who received the said payment, whether it accrues to him as a past service

to SLC or as an incentive or motivation or advance to enter into a future

contract with SLC under which he would perform services for SLC.

[156] Now, reverting to the facts of this case, the Appellant was injured and

therefore, not selected by SLC for certain matches during the term of the

contract from 01.03.2007 to 28.02.2008 and as a result, the Appellant lost

match fees and tour fees as indicated in paragraph 3 of the letter sent by

the Cricketers Association. As the contract was not renewed by SLC at the

expiry of the period on 28.02.2008, the Appellant on 09.08.2008, through

the Cricketers Association wrote to SLC seeking to secure a new central

contract from SLC while also highlighting the loss of match fees and tour

fees during the period he was injured from 01.03.2007 to 28.02.2008.

[157] On 19.09.2008, SLC granted the sum of USD 15,000 to compensate

the Appellant without any reference to the purpose of the payment except

to refer to Lasith Malingas Central Contract as the caption of the said

letter, which has the same reference to the letter sent by the Cricketers

Association.

New Contract with SLC with effect from 01.03.2008 to 28.02.2009

[158] Significantly, the Appellant and SLC entered into a new central

contract No. 122 in November 2008 (without specifying the date) but the

term of the contract stipulates that the contract shall be in force for a

period of 12 months from 01.03.2008 to 28.02.2009 (Vide-Sri Lanka Cricket

Players Annual Contract 2008/2009, No. 122 at pp. 298-314 of the Tax

Appeals Commission brief). Page 1 of the Contract reads as follows:

THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into at Colombo on this day of November 2008 between Arjuna Ranatunga Chairman, Kangadaran Mathivanan Secretary Sujeewa Rajapakse, Treasurer, Sidath Wettimuni, Lalith Wickremasinghe, Premasara Epasinghe, Guy De Alwis, Ashok Pathirage and Aravinda De Silva, Members of the Interim Committee

56

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

appointed by the Honourable Minister of Sports and Public Recreation ......... (hereinafter called and referred to as SLC) of the One Part and Lasith Malinga of Bopegoda, Ratgama (hereinafter referred to as Player) of the Other Part....

[159] Paragraph 2 of the Contract at page 3 reads as follows:

2. TERM

This agreement shall be in force for a period of Twelve (12) months

commencing on the first (01st) day of March 2008 and ending on the 28th

day of February 2009 (hereinafter referred to as the

Term)..........................

[160] There is no dispute that the Appellant entered into a contract with

SLC for the period 2008/2009 and thus, the Appellant was contracted to

SLC for the said period (see further p.15 of the written submissions filed

on behalf of the Appellant). The significant aspect of this new contract is,

however, that there is a close connection between the payment of USD

15,000 granted to the Appellant on 19.09.2008 and the contract fee of Rs.

60,000 agreed by the parties in the said contract signed in November 2008.

[161] In the Annual Contract for the period from 01.03.2008 to 28.02.2009,

SLC agreed to pay the Appellant an annual contract fee equivalent of US$

60,000/- for the entirety of the term (12 months) but deducted the said

US$ 15,000/- already granted to the Appellant from the contract fee

of US$ 60,000/- as indicated in clause 4.3. of the contact as follows:

4.3 Deductions from payments

USD 15,000/- which SLC have been already given to you will be deducted

from the contract fee of USD 60,000/-

It is to be noted that the obvious typographical errors in clause 4.3 above

shall, in my view stand corrected as SLC has already given to you).

[162] It is crystal clear that the payment of US$ 15,000/- was granted on

16.09.2008 in response to the letter dated 01.09.2008 in which the

Cricketers Association first complained about the unfair denial of a new

contract to the Appellant from 01.03.2008 to 28.02.2009. Then the

Association appealed to SLC to reassess the decision not to award a central

57

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

contract to a match winning outstanding Cricketer so as to enable him to

play Cricket as soon as possible (paragraphs 5 and 6).

[163] After the payment of US$ 15,000 was granted by SLC to the Appellant

on 19.08.2008, SLC proceeded to enter into the new central contract with

the Appellant in November 2008 covering the entire period from

01.03.2008 to 28.02.2009 as requested by the Appellant in the said letter

dated 09.08.2008 but deducted the said sum of Rs. 15,000/- from the

contract fee of USD 60,000. The Appellant as the Player and Mr. K.

Mathivanan and Mr. Duleep Mendis, Secretary, Interim Committee and the

Chief executive of SLC on behalf of SLC signed the said Contract in the

presence of two witnesses at Colombo.

[164] Why did the Appellant agree to deduct the said sum of USD 15,000

granted to him by SLC on 19.09.2008 if it was granted to him only as

compensation for injuries sustained by him which is not an emolument

received from the employment contract? Why did SLC deduct USD 15,000

from the contract fee of USD 60,000 referred to in the new contract unless

USD 15,000 was a payment made to the Appellant as an inducement or

advance to enter into a future contract of employment and perform

services in the future? If the said sum of USD 15,000 was intended to be a

payment for compensation for injuries as claimed by the Appellant, there

was absolutely no reason for the parties to refer to the said payment as

part of the new employment contract signed in November 2008, deduct

the said payment from the contract fee and agree that the term of the

contract will be effective from 01.03.2008 to 28.02.2009.

[165] The Appellant who agreed to deduct USD 15,000 from the contract

fee of USD 60,000 for the period from 01.03.2008 to 28.02.2009 on the

basis that the said USD 15,000 was already paid to him by SLC cannot now

blow hot and cold and invite us to hold that the said payment was not a

part of the new central contract with SLC for the period from 01.03.2008

and 28.02.2009.

[166] The result is that the Appellant and SLC regarded that the payment

of USD 15,000 was part of the earning of the Appellants contract of

employment for the period from 01.03.2008 to 28.02.2009 and thus, from

the standpoint of the Appellant, it was an emolument from his contract of

employment and part of the contract fee of USD 60,000. Thus, it was not a

mere compensation for injuries as he claimed by the Appellant.

Deduction of Withholding Tax by SLC from USD 15,000

[167] As noted in paragraph 112, the use of the word compensation in a

document authorising payment by a payer in his own selection is not

decisive and thus, the question whether a payment which is termed as

compensation by the payer in his own selection is a capital payment or a

revenue payment solely depends on the facts and circumstances of

particular case.

[168] Details of payments from 01.04.2008 to 31.03.2009 issued by the

Accountant of SLC in respect of the Appellant as indicated at p. 158 of the

Tax Appeals Commission read as follows:

6,304,410.77 315,220.54

[169] The table reveals that SLC has deducted a sum of Rs. 80,475/- as

withholding tax out of the said USD 15,000 (Rs. 1,609,500/0) received by

the Appellant from SLC on the basis that the said payment was part of the

employment income of the Appellant together with contract fees and

match fees referred thereof.

[170] In Craib v. Commissioner of Income Tax (supra), a special payment was

granted to a retired Superintendent of an Estate in view of his exceptional

services to the Company and in consideration of the fact that he had to

undergo medical treatment at Home. Under such circumstances, the

59

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

Supreme Court held that the payment was a personal gift and could not

be registered as profits from any employment within the meaning of the

Income Tax Act.

[171] In the present case, no question of premature termination of

contract or premature retirement of the Appellant arises due to injuries as

a new annual contract was granted by SLC to the Appellant with effect from

01.03.2008 to 28.02.2009 but both parties agreed that the said payment of

US$ 15,000 was to be regarded as part of the employment contract for the

said period.

[172] Applying the principles enunciated and the facts and circumstances

of the case, I am not inclined to agree with Mr. De Seram that the amount

was paid as a capital sum as compensation for injuries to the Appellant as

envisaged by Section 13 (f) of the Inland Revenue Act. The Tax Appeals

Commission correctly decided that the said payment of USD 15,000 (Rs.

1,609,500) will not fall under Section 13 (f) of the Inland Revenue Act. In the

result, the said amount of USD 15,000 (Rs. 1,609,500/-) is an income within

the meaning of the judicial definition of income referred to in Thornhill v.

Commissioner of Income Tax (supra).

[173] I am of the view that the said payment of USD 15,000 was granted

by SLC to the Appellant being a prospective employee as an advance or

inducement to enter into a contract of employment with SLC and perform

services in the future, which the Appellant did and included the said

payment as part of the contract fee for the period from 01.03.2008 to

28.02.2009. It constitutes an income from employment within the meaning

of Section 4 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act. Accordingly, the Appellant and

SLC entered into the new contract of employment in November 2008 for

the period from 01.03.2008 to 28.02.2009, deducted the said USD 15,000

from the contract fee of USD 60,000 and performed the services as an

employee under the said contract of employment. The said amount of USD

15,000 is an income accrued to the Appellant from employment under

Section 4 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act and therefore, is assessable to

income tax as correctly decided by the Assessor in the assessment.

[174 That payment of USD 15,000 is not limited to mere loss of income as

a rest player as stated by the Tax Appeals Commission and that part of the

60

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

finding of the Tax Appeals Commission shall stand corrected. The Tax

Appels Commission however, correctly decided that the said payment of

USD 15,000 was not compensation for the injury suffered by the Appellant

and therefore, the said payment will not fall under Section 13 (f) of the

Inland Revenue Act.

Conclusion & Opinion of Court

[175] In these circumstances, I answer Questions of Law arising in the case

stated against the Appellant and in favour of the Respondent as follows:

1. No. The Tax Appeals Commission correctly decided that the sum

of Rs. 1,609,500/- does not come within the exemption set out in

Section 13 (f) of the Inland Revenue Act. It was a payment granted

to the Appellant as an advance or inducement to enter into a

contract of employment and perform services in the future, which

the Appellant did and included the said payment as part of the

contract fee. It is an income accrued to the Appellant and received

from employment;

2. No. The contract fees paid to the Appellant in respect of the

matches played in Sri Lanka are not determined on the basis of

the number of matches played by the Appellant in Sri Lanka and

therefore, the contract fees paid to the Appellant do not fall within

the purview of Section 13 (v) of the Act. Match fees derived by the

Appellant from the participation as competitor in respect of

matches held in Sri Lanka and at which competitor from outside

Sri Lanka participated, are exempted from income tax under

Section 13 (v) of the Act. The Assessor has granted such

exemptions accordingly (see-pp258-259)

Match fees received by the Appellant from provincial matches

played in Sri Lanka do not involve a foreign competitor from

outside Sri Lanka and such match fees do not fall within the scope

of the exemption under Section 13 (v). They are liable to income

tax and the Assessor has correctly taken the same position.

3. Contract fees and match fees paid to the Appellant for services

rendered to the SLC in respect of matches held overseas in the

61

CA TAX 0015 2019 TAC/IT/043/2015

course of his employment under the contract with SLC are not

exempted from income tax under Section 8 (1) (j) of the Inland

Revenue Act;

4. The amount of Rs. 1,609,500/- is an income from employment

within the meaning of the judicial definition of income referred to

in Thornhill v Commissioner of Income Tax (supra);

5. No, the answers to above questions of law Nos. 2 and 3 applies;

6. No, subject to the above answers.

[176] For the reasons enumerated in this judgment, and subject to our

observations in paragraphs 43-45 and 174 of this judgment, we confirm

the assessment determined by the Tax Appeals Commission dated

07.05.2019.

[177] The Registrar is directed to send a certified copy of this judgment to

the Tax Appeals Commission.
