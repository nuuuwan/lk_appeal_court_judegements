Decided on: 25.10.2021

Sobhitha Rajakaruna, J.

The Petitioner filed this application mainly seeking for a mandate in the nature of a Writ of

Certiorari quashing the Order of the learned Magistrate (marked as P10) issued in case No.

B/299/2020 in the Magistrate's Court of Nugegoda on 02.03.2020; and quashing the

summons (marked as P11) issued against the Petitioner, by the said Magistrate's Court.

Before this matter was formally fixed for argument, Petitioner filed the motion dated

16.09.2021 and moved for an Order from this Court directing the learned Magistrate of

Nugegoda to discharge forthwith the Petitioner from the said proceedings. The Petitioner

has filed the said motion on the strength of the affidavit dated 16.03.2021 filed in this

application by the 3rd Respondent, Acting Inspector General of Police. The third

Respondent in his affidavit has affirmed that no offence had been disclosed against the

Petitioner as per the investigations conducted up to that date in the said case in the

Magistrate's Court of Nugegoda. Additionally, the 3rd Respondent has filed a motion dated

21.09.2021 drawing the attention of this Court to the documents annexed thereto marked as

X1, X2 & X3.

All parties, on 16.09.2021 informed this Court that the pleadings were completed and

accordingly, moved that the instant application be dealt with and determined without

hearing oral submissions. The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner and the learned

President's Counsel for the 3rd Respondent informed that no written submissions would be

filed on behalf of those respective parties. However, they moved that this matter be

determined based on the pleadings and on the contents of the motion dated 16.09.2021 filed

by the Petitioner as well as on the contents of motion dated 21.09.2021 and the affidavit

dated 16.03.2021 filed by the 3rd Respondent. The learned Deputy Solicitor General

appearing for the 2nd Respondent requested this Court to consider the contents of the motion

dated 27.09.2021 and the Statement of Objections filed on behalf of the 2nd Respondent in

making a determination in this case.

When this matter was taken up for clarifications from the learned Counsel on 13.10.2021,

the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner moved that the Court be issued a writ of

Prohibition as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition and also a direction be issued to the

learned Magistrate to discharge the Petitioner forthwith. Anyhow, the Petitioner in the

prayer of his Petition, seeks for a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari also to quash

the order dated 02.03.2020 and the summons issued on the same date.

Atkin L.J., in R v. Electricity Commissioner [ (1924) 1 KB 171 p. 206] has observed as

follows;

I can see no difference in principle between certiorari and prohibition, except that the latter may be

invoked at an earliest stage. If the proceedings established that the body complained of exceeding its

jurisdiction by entertaining matters which would result in its final decision being brought up and

quashed on certiorari, I think that prohibition will lie to restrain it from so exceeding its jurisdiction1.

Now it is important to ascertain whether there are grounds to issue a writ of prohibition or a

writ of certiorari.

The Petitioner of the instant application has been made the 2ndsuspect by the learned

Magistrate in the relevant Magistrates Court Case No.B/299/2020 as per the journal entry

of 02.03.2020. The learned Magistrate has arrived at a conclusion in his order dated

02.03.2020 (P10) that adequate grounds exist to initiate proceedings in the said case against

the Petitioner on the offences under sections 101, 113 A, 190 of the Penal Code. However,

the B Report against the main suspect (1st suspect2) in the said Magistrates Court case,

significantly, has not been filed on an offence under the Penal Code. The said B report

against the said 1st suspect has been filed on an offence under Article 111 C (2) of the

Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka.

In terms of the said Article 111 C (2) every person who, without legal authority, interferes or

attempts to interfere with the exercise or performance of the judicial powers or functions of

any judge, presiding officer, public officer or such other person as is referred to in paragraph

1 Also see Coorey, Sunil F.A., Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka, 4th Ed., Vol. II, 906. 2 The name of the 1st suspect- Saddha Viddha Rajapakshe Palanga Pathira Amba Kumaaralaage Ranjan Leo Sylvester Alponsu Ramanayake alias Ranjan Ramanayake

Page 4 of 8

(1) of the said Article, shall be guilty of an offence. The learned Magistrate has made the

Petitioner a suspect mainly on offences of abetment and conspiracy. On perusal of the said

order of the learned Magistrate and other documents in the case record, it appears that the

learned Magistrate has identified exclusively the Petitioner as the judge or the presiding

officer within the meaning of the said Article. It is apparent that it was because the 1st

suspect was making inquiries from the Petitioner over the telephone about a case (filed by

the Commission to Investigate Allegation of Bribery or Corruption) that came up before the

Petitioner during the period he was serving as the Chief Magistrate of Colombo. Therefore,

considering the nature of the said offence in the said Article 111 C (2), a question arises here

as to whether an abetment charge could be brought in against the same judge who was

influenced by another person (in this case the 1st suspect) in committing the said offence

provided in the said Article.

Prof. Pieris,3 in his celebrated book on Criminal Liability, says that both in English law and

in our law, the appropriate test is whether the act abetted and the act done are so closely

related, as to their nature and object, that the one could be considered a natural extension of

the other. The essential elements of liability on the part of the abettor for the act done are;

i. That the abettor's influence continues to operate on the will of the person abetted

and, to that extent, supplies or contributes to the motivation of the later in

committing the offence, and;

ii. That the act done there is a reasonable relation to prosecution of the criminal object

entertained by the abettor

In terms of the aforesaid order of the learned Magistrate the abettor seems to be the 1st

suspect of the case in the said Magistrates Court case and the person abetted is the 2nd

suspect (Petitioner). Therefore, when considering the elements of liability on the part of the

person abetted is based on the offence that would be committed or intended to be

committed by the abettor. It is unique that, in the said Magistrates Court case, the person

who was subject to be interfered as per the said Article 111 C (2) has become the person

3 Pieris, G.L., General Principles of Criminal Liability in Ceylon, 1980, Lake House Investments Ltd., p.407

Page 5 of 8

abetted upon the offence that would be committed or intended to be committed by the

Abettor under the said Article. In other words, the victim upon the offence described in the

said Article 111 C (2) is going to be charged on the offence of abetment. In my view, such a

scenario cannot be accepted in law based on the principles of criminal liability on the

offence of abetment. Therefore, I am of the view that the decision of the leaned Magistrate

to make the Petitioner a suspect in the said Magistrates Court case is ultravires as the B

report against the 1st suspect has been filed only under the offence in Article 111 C (2).

In The Queen v. D.D. Ginigandara and another (70 NLR 192) Sansoni C.J. held that;

The point argued by Mr. Chitty was that the first accused- appellant could not be convicted of using

criminal force when the only charge framed against him was that of aiding and abetting the second

accused-appellant in the offence of attempted murder. There is a decision of this court which we think is

in point- the case of Queen v. D.K. Dhanapala4 , where it was held that on a charge of abetment of

attempted murder, a person cannot be convicted of voluntarily causing simple hurt. We would follow

that decision.

Prof. Pieris says that the principle reflected in the above case is obviously in the interest of

protection of the accused who has to be given the opportunity of informing himself of the

nature of the charge against him and of preparing his defence adequately5.

Now I turn to the matter of issuance of a writ of prohibition in addition to my above

findings upon ultravires. The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner made the

application for a writ of prohibition and also a direction to the learned Magistrate to

discharge the Petitioner, based on the statement of the 3rd Respondent's who says that there

was no evidence against the Petitioner. The learned President's Counsel for 3rd Respondent

categorically intimated to this Court that he has instructions from the 3rd Respondent to

submit that there was no evidence to proceed with the said case in the Magistrate's Court

Nugegoda against the Petitioner.

The second Respondent, Attorney General by way of his motion dated 27.09.2021 has

drawn the attention of this court to two documents marked as X1 and X2. By letter dated

14.07.2021 (X1) the second Respondent has advised the third Respondent to conduct further

investigations against the Petitioner on matters mentioned in that letter. The third

Respondent by his letter dated 26.07.2021 (X2) has intimated to the second Respondent that

a question had arisen as to whether further investigation could be continued as a result of

the stay order issued by this Court on 08.06.2020. However, the second Respondent has not

responded to the said letter X2. When this matter was mentioned on 13.10.2021 for

clarifications, the learned Deputy solicitor General tendered a copy of a very recent

communication addressed to the second Respondent by the third Respondent. According, to

the said letter dated 27.09.2021 which is filed of record now, the third Respondent reiterates

the fact that there are no grounds to frame charges or to report to the Magistrates Court

against the Petitioner. Furthermore, the learned Presidents Counsel for the third

Respondent submitted to Court on 13.10.2021 that the statement made by the third

Respondent in X2 on the stay order of this court is only in respect to the investigations

against the 1st suspect of the Magistrates Court case and not with regard to any

investigations against the 2nd suspect.

The second Respondent in his motion dated 27.09.2021 has expressly not objected to the

application made by the learned Presidents Counsel to discharge the Petitioner from the

Magistrates Court proceedings and instead has requested this Court to consider the

contents of the said motion in taking a decision on the application made by the Petitioner.

Even on 13.10.2021 the second Respondent tendered only the said letter dated 27.09.2021

of the third Respondent and has not raised any objections.

The below mentioned passage in the article titled The grounds for Certiorari and

Prohibition by D.C.M. Yardley oxford in Canadian Bar Review XXXVII is in my view

apt here.Where a jurisdiction depends upon a contingency which has been fulfilled, then the

jurisdiction is as good as if it had existed ab initio, but there are occasions when the contingent

jurisdiction rests upon acquiescence. Thus, where a summons to a defendant to appear before a county

court was issued on 3rd January, 1850, but was based on an order made by the county court judge on

30th October, 1847, which had given the plaintiff leave to issue a summons, there was some doubt as to

Page 7 of 8

the validity of the order. Because of the delay in the issue of the summons it was submitted that a new

order authorizing the summons should have been made. But it was held that the defendant had

acquiesced in the procedure by leaving a notice with the clerk of the county court, stating that he

intended to rely on the statute of limitations as a bar to the action, and he had thus waived his right to

object to the jurisdiction of the county court6.Similarly, an irregularity of procedure may be the subject

of waiver, so as to preclude the granting of a prohibition after judgment7. But acquiescence will only

make a contingent jurisdiction complete, and will not remedy a jurisdiction which is faulty ab initio.

For example, in a case of 18558, the parties to a plaint in a county court appeared before the judge and

consented to a reference to arbitrators, without objecting to the fact that there was a want of jurisdiction.

One of the parties, however, during the progress of the reference, did object to the jurisdiction of the

arbitrators, on the ground that title to land came in question, but the arbitrators proceeded with the

reference. It was determined that the applicant was nevertheless entitled to the issue of a prohibition.

Cave J., in Moore v. Gamgee, elaborated on the problem9 :

The acquiescence of the third Respondent is not that he does not object to the jurisdiction of

the learned Magistrate; but particularly not to proceed against the second Respondent in the

said Magistrates Court case. The third Respondent submits that there is no evidence to

proceed against the Petitioner whereas the second Respondent does not raise any objections

or rather silently consent to the stance taken by the third Respondent. The writ of

Prohibition which is a prerogative writ can be usually issued when the trial Judge is illegally

presiding over the case. However, I am of the view that a writ of Prohibition can be issued

even when the Court has lost legal jurisdiction to try the case. Therefore, based on the above

grounds the learned Magistrate has lost legal jurisdiction to try the case against the

Petitioner and it is an independent ground, in my view, to issue a writ of Prohibition in this

case without issuing a specific direction to release the Petitioner from those proceedings.

In the circumstance, I issue a writ of Prohibition prohibiting the first Respondent from

proceeding against the Petitioner in case bearing No. B/299/2020 on the grounds

mentioned in the first Respondents order dated 02.03.2020.

For the reasons adduced above, I proceed to issue a writ of certiorari also;

(i) quashing the orders of the learned Magistrate made on 02.03.2020 in respect of

the Petitioner, including the order by which the Petitioner was made the 2nd

suspect in the case bearing No. B/299/2020

(ii) quashing the summons marked as P11

I make no order for costs.
