MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 10th Defendant-Petitioners (hereinafter referred to as the

Petitioners) are seeking Leave to Appeal from the order of the Wakfs Tribunal

dated 02.03.2019. The leave was granted on 24.05.2019.

The Plaintiff-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Respondents), in

terms of the provisions of the Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or

Wakfs Act No. 51 of 1956 (as amended), instituted action before the Tribunal

against the petitioners, seeking, inter alia,

1. To declare that the properties referred to in the Deed of Trust bearing

No. 2125 is a charitable trust and governed by the provisions of Muslim

Mosques and Charitable Trust or Wakfs Act.

2. To declare that the trustees of the said trust are mandated by the said

trust to maintain the buildings and meet all cost of expenses that may

be required to teach Arabic Language and maintain the students of the

Gafooriya Arabic College.

At the hearing of the Tribunal on 02.03.2019, the learned Counsel for the

Petitioners raised Preliminary Objections as to the maintainability of this

action on the basis that:

Page 7 of 10

1. The Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear and determine the said

disputes that were presented to the Tribunal by the Respondents as the

said Trust is not subject to the provisions of the Wakfs Act.

2. The Respondents failed to file the Directors certificate1, along with the

plaint and therefore, the plaint is bad in law.

It appears to this Court that the Tribunal has not yet made any orders in

respect of the first objection. However, the Tribunal, in its order dated

02.03.2019, overruled the second objection. It is against that order the instant

appeal is preferred.

In terms of section 9E (3) of the Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or

Wakfs Act No. 51 of 1956 (as amended), the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to

entertain applications without a certificate issued by the Director, which

reads thus:

No application, other than an application made by the Director, shall be

entertained by the Tribunal under this section unless the application is

accompanied by a certificate under the hand of the Director that the

application has been approved by the board.

Admittedly, on 13.11.2018, the Respondents instituted action against the

Petitioners in the Wakfs Tribunal. At that time, the Respondents had not

obtained a certificate in terms of section 9E (3) of the said Act. Subsequently,

the Respondents, along with the amended plaint dated 02.03.2019, tendered

a certificate under the hand of the Director.

The observation made by the Wakfs Tribunal was that the action has

subsequently been approved by the Board and the certificate has been issued.

The irregularity of the non-filing a certificate with the original plaint has

subsequently been rectified2, which is permitted in law.

Thus, the question that arises for determination in this appeal is whether the

irregularity the non-filing a certificate along with the original plaint can be

rectified subsequently during the pendency of the action.

In this regard, I refer to the case of Rodrigo vs. Raymond3 . This is the case

where the action was filed without first obtaining a certificate of non-

settlement from the Mediation Board. The Court of Appeal held that,

1) Absence of a certificate does not create an absolute bar to the

institution, and the maintenance of an action, even where the value of the action is less than Rs. 25,800. 2) It only creates a latent want of jurisdiction as opposed to total lack of

jurisdiction or patent want of jurisdiction, where there is a latent want of jurisdiction, it can be validated by the conduct of parties, such waiver, acquiescence and inaction unlike in the case of total or patent want of jurisdiction, no such conduct will confer jurisdiction on the Court.

Absence of a certificate is a procedural defect which could be rectified during

the pendency of an action. It is pertinent to be noted that there will be no

prejudice caused to the Petitioners for not filing of a certificate along with the

original plaint.

In Gunaratne vs. Abeysingha4 the Supreme Court observed that,

A noncompliance with a procedural requirement could be treated mere

irregularity when there is no material prejudice caused to the parties due

to such procedural noncompliance.

In the instant case, it is to be noted that there is no material prejudice caused

to the etitioners for not filing a certificate with the original plaint. However,

the said irregularity has subsequently been rectified by producing a certificate

with the amended plaint.

I do agree with the observation made by the Wakfs Tribunal stating that this

is a technical objection raised by the learned Counsel for the Petitioners5.

In the case of Elias vs. Cader6, the Supreme Court observed that,

...For the proper dispensation of justice, raising of technical objections

should be discouraged and the parties should be encouraged to seek

justice by dealing with the merits of cases. The raising of such technical

objections and dealing with them and the subsequent challenges on them

to the superior courts takes up so much time and adds up to the delay

and the backlog of cases pending in Courts. Very often the dealing of

such technicalities become only an academic exercise with which the

litigants would not be interested. The delay in dispensation of justice can

be minimized if the parties are discouraged from taking up technical

objections which takes up valuable judicial time. What is important for

litigants would be their aspiration to get justice from courts on merits

rather than on technicalities. As has often been quoted it must be

remembered that courts of law are Courts of justice and not academies

of law.7

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners cited the case of Sheriff

vs. Jamaldeen8 where it was held that, it is mandatory to obtain a certificate

from the Director to invoke the jurisdiction of the District Court/Wakfs Tribunal.

It is pertinent to be noted that the Sheriffs case (supra) is factually different

from the instant case. In the case in hand, the said certificate has

subsequently been filed by the respondents during the pendency of the action

before the argument. But, in Sheriffs case the approval was not obtained from

the Board and the certificate was not issued by the Director. In the

circumstances, it is the view of this Court that the decision in Sheriffs case

has no application to the instant case.

The attention of this court is drawn to the fact that the Petitioners failed to

produce the certificate filed by the Respondents in the Wakfs Tribunal, along

with their amended petition where they are obliged to do so.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no basis to interfere with the order of the

Wakfs Tribunal dated 02.03.2019. Thus, the appeal is dismissed with costs,

fixed at Rs. 25,000/-.

The Registrar is directed to dispatch the order to the Wakf Tribunal.
