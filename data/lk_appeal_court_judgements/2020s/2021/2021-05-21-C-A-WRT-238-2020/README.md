Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA The Petitioner is a member of the United National Party (UNP). He states that he

successfully contested the Kirapane Ward situated in the Gampola Urban Council

area at the Local Authorities elections held on 10th February 2018. The Petitioner

states further that at the Council meeting held on 10th April 2018, the Petitioner was

elected as the Chairman of the Urban Council, Gampola.

The Petitioner states that on 19th March 2020, he tendered his nomination to contest

from the Kandy District at the Parliamentary Elections from the Samagi Jana

Balawegaya. The said elections were held in August 2020, but the Petitioner was not

elected.

Disciplinary Action by the UNP

The Petitioner states that on 18th June 2020, he received a letter dated 22nd May

2020, marked P5, from the leader of the UNP, stating that his membership in the

UNP has been suspended for violating the Constitution of the UNP, as it had been

reported that the Petitioner has tendered his nominations to contest the

Parliamentary Elections from another political party.1 By P5, the Petitioner has been

requested to show cause within seven days of the receipt of the said letter, as to why

disciplinary action should not be taken against him.

The Petitioner states that after requesting further time to respond, he submitted an

explanation by letter dated 30th June 2020, marked P7, informing that his decision

to contest from the Samagi Jana Balawegaya was in conformity with a decision

taken by the Working Committee of the UNP. The Petitioner admits that thereafter

he was served with a charge sheet marked P9 and directed to appear before the

Disciplinary Committee of the UNP on 25th July 2020. The Petitioner states that at his

request the inquiry was initially postponed to 1st August 2020 and thereafter

postponed by the Chairman of the Disciplinary Committee without specifying a date

vide P13.

1See paragraph 3.4(we) of P16.

5

However, by letter dated 28th July 2020, marked P14, the Petitioner had been

informed by the 2nd Respondent, the General Secretary of the UNP that the Working

Committee of the UNP, acting on the recommendation of its Disciplinary Committee

had decided to expel the Petitioner from the UNP.

Intimation by the 1st Respondent

By a letter dated 11th August 2020, marked P15 the 1st Respondent, the Returning

Officer for the Gampola Urban Council, referring to the aforementioned decision of

the UNP, had sent the following letter to the Petitioner:

ta fya;=fjka Tn by; iNdfjs oerE iysl Oqrh w;yer we;ehs ujsiska m<d;a md,k

.eigs m;%fha m< lrkq ,nk nj fuhska okajus. Aggrieved by the decision of the UNP to expel him from its membership, and the

intimation of the 1st Respondent in P15, the Petitioner filed this application, seeking

inter alia the following relief:

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the purported recommendation, if any, of the

Disciplinary Committee recommending that the Petitioner be expelled from the

UNP, as evidenced by P14;

(b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the Working Committee of the UNP

to expel the Petitioner from the UNP, as evidenced by the letter marked P15;

(c) A Writ of Prohibition prohibiting and/or preventing the 1st Respondent from

acting in terms of Section 10A(1)(a) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance

as amended (the Ordinance) and declaring that the Petitioner has vacated his

office as a member of the Urban Council, Gampola.

Preliminary objections

When this matter was taken up for support, the learned Presidents Counsel for the

2nd Respondent raised the following three objections relating to the maintainability

of this application:

6

I. All members of the Working Committee of the UNP have not been made parties

to this application, and therefore necessary parties are not before Court;

II. In any event, decisions of the Working Committee of the UNP are not amenable

to the Writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal;

III. The Returning Officer (1st Respondent) exercises only a ministerial function in

terms of Section 10A(1)(a) of the Ordinance and is thus not amenable to the

writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.

As all learned Counsel were agreeable to the said objections being considered as

preliminary issues of law, this Court directed the learned Presidents Counsel for the

2nd Respondent to tender written submissions on the said preliminary objections and

for the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner and the learned Senior State

Counsel to respond thereto.

I shall now consider each of the above three objections.

The first objection was that even though the Petitioner was seeking to quash the

decision of the Working Committee of the UNP to expel the Petitioner from its

membership vide P14- all members of the Working Committee of the UNP who

made the said decision reflected in P14 have not been made respondents to this

application. It was submitted further that the failure to do so renders this application

liable to be dismissed in limine.

The legal position on naming necessary parties

It is trite law that any person whose rights are affected by an order that a petitioner

is inviting a Court of law to make in his favour is entitled to be named as a party and

is entitled to be heard, before Court makes any order adverse to such person. The

rule is that all those who would be affected by the outcome of an application should

be made respondents to such application.2

2 See Hatton National Bank PLC vs Commissioner General of Labour and Others. [CA (Writ) Application No. 457/2011; CA Minutes of 31st January 2020; per Janak De Silva, J]

7

The consequences of a party who is necessary to a proper adjudication of an

application not being named as a party has been considered by the Supreme Court as

well as by this Court in several cases.

In the case of Rawaya Publishers and others v Wijedasa Rajapaksha, Chairman Sri

Lanka Press Council and Others3 the petitioners sought to quash the order made by

the 1st 7th respondents, that the petitioners should apologise to the complainant,

the Secretary General of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). The Secretary

General of the JVP however was not made a party to the proceedings.

Upholding the objection of the respondents that a failure to cite the Secretary

General of the JVP was fatal to the maintainability of that application, this Court held

as follows:

In the context of writ applications, a necessary party is one without whom no

order can be effectively made. A proper party is one in whose absence an

effective order can be made but whose presence is necessary to a complete

and final decision on the question involved in the proceedings. In the case of

Udit Narain Singh Malpaharia v. Additional Member Board of Revenue, Bihar

and another4,it has been held that where a writ application is filed in respect

of an order of the Board of Revenue not only the Board itself is a necessary

party but also the parties in whose favour the Board has pronounced the

impugned decision because without them no effective decision can be made. If

they are not made parties then the petition can be dismissed in limine. It has

also been held that persons vitally affected by the writ petition are all

necessary parties. If their number is very large, some of them could be made

respondents in a representative capacity (vide Prabodh Verma and others v.

State of Uttar Pradesh and others5 also see Encyclopaedia of Writ Law By P. M.

Bakshi).

Wijeratne (Commissioner of Motor Traffic) v. Ven Dr. Paragoda Wimalawansa

Thero and Others6 concerned a Buddhist priest who sought to quash the decision of

the Commissioner of Motor Traffic not to issue a driving license to the Petitioner

upon a decision being made by the Samastha Lanka Sasanarakshaka Mandalaya that

it would be inappropriate to issue driving licenses to Bhikkus. The Commissioner of

Motor Traffic raised a preliminary objection that the Commissioner of Buddhist

Affairs, who communicated the decision of the Samastha Lanka Sasanarakshaka

Mandalaya to the Commissioner of Motor Traffic has not been made a respondent.

The Court of Appeal rejected the preliminary objection. The Commissioner of Motor

Traffic appealed to the Supreme Court which upheld the decision of the Court of

Appeal on the basis that the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs has not made any

decision or determination with regard to the application for a driving license.

However, the Supreme Court laid down two rules in respect of naming necessary

parties. It was held that:

The first rule regarding the necessary parties to an application for a writ of

certiorari is that the person or authority whose decision or exercise of power is

sought to be quashed should be made a respondent to the application. If it is a

body of persons whose decision or exercise of power is sought to be quashed

each of the persons constituting such body who took part in taking the

impugned decision or the exercise of power should be made respondent. The

failure to make him or them respondents to the application is fatal and provides

in itself a ground for the dismissal of the application in limine. Jamila Umma vs.

Mohamed

7, P. Karunaratna vs. the Commissioner of Co-operative Development

and another8; British Ceylon Corporation vs Weerasekera and Others9.

If the act sought to be impugned had been done by one party on a direction

given by another party who has power granted by law to give such direction, the

party who had given the direction is also a necessary party and the failure to

6[2011] 2 Sri LR 258 at 267 per Amaratunga, J. 750 NLR 15. 879 2 NLR 193. 9[1982] 1 Sri LR 180.

9

make such party a respondent is fatal to the validity of the application.

Mudiyanse v. Christie Silva, Government Agent, Hambantota10.

The second rule is that those who would be affected by the outcome of the writ

application should be made respondents to the application, Abayadeera and

others v. Dr. Stanley Wijesundara, Vice Chancellor, University of Colombo and

another11; Farook vs. Siriwardena, Election Officer and Others12.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd Respondent has drawn my attention to

the judgment of this Court in Arulsamy v Upcountry Peoples Front and Others.13 In

this case, the petitioner was elected as a member of the Central Provincial Council as

a nominee of the 1st Respondent, the Upcountry Peoples Front, a recognized political

party. The Petitioner later received a letter from the 3rd respondent, asking him to

show cause on certain disciplinary charges leveled against him. This Court was called

upon to determine whether the expulsion of the Petitioner from the Upcountry

Peoples Front was valid or not. The respondents took up the position that the

petitioner has not named the members of the Disciplinary Committee and the

Central Committee as parties to the action.

Upholding the objection of the respondents, Sripavan J (as he then was) held as

follows:

This court also takes the view that when mala fides are alleged against the

purported expulsion, the members of the Central Committee who took the

decision must necessarily be made parties to this application. Since the

preliminary objection raised by the learned Presidents Counsel is of a

fundamental nature which strikes at the heart of the jurisdiction of this Court, I

hold that the conduct of the respondents do not disentitle them from taking the

objection relating to necessary parties even though it was not specifically

pleaded in their statement of objections. In my view, it is not only mandatory

but fairness too requires prima facie that the members of the Central

10[1985] 2 Sri LR 52. 11[1983] 2 Sri LR 267. 12[1997] 1 Sri LR 145. 13[2006] 3 Sri LR 386.

10

Committee be made respondents , an opportunity be given to explain,

controvert or mitigate the case against them and the right to make submissions.

For the reasons set out above, I hold that the failure to make the members of

the Central Committee as parties to this application is fatal and this application

therefore fails.14

The 2nd Respondent has also cited the case of Gnanasambanthan v Rear Admiral

Perera and Others.15 In this case, the Petitioner and his son obtained title to a

portion of the property of the 2nd and 3rd respondents, which were subsequently

damaged in the 1983 riots. In terms of Section 19 of the Emergency (Rehabilitation of

Affected Property, Business or Industries) Regulations made under Section 5 of the

Public Security Ordinance, the said premises were declared as affected property,

and the Rehabilitation of Property and Industries Authority (REPIA), in the exercise of

its powers under the said regulations divested the property to the 2nd and

3rdrespondents. The letter was signed by the Chairman of REPIA.

The petitioner sought a Writ of Certiorari to quash the said decision and a Writ of

Mandamus to divest the property to the Petitioner. REPIA was not made a party to

the action although its Chairman, who signed the letter was named. The Court of

Appeal dismissed the petition on this basis. The Court held that what is sought to be

quashed is an order from REPIA and not its Chairman. The question was therefore

whether REPIA should have been cited as a necessary party because it was a decision

which only REPIA was empowered to make.

On appeal, the Supreme Court held that the failure to cite REPIA was a fatal

irregularity. In response to the submission of the learned Counsel for the petitioner

that the failure to make the party who made an impugned order would not justify

the rejection of the petition without reference to the merits of the case,

Amerasinghe, J held that:

In any event, how does one go into the merits of a case without hearing the

necessary parties.

14Ibid; page 392. 15[1998] 3 Sri LR 169.

11

The position therefore is that if a necessary party is not made a respondent, the

application is liable to be dismissed in limine. I use the word liable as, for reasons

that I would advert to later, it is a decision that is within the discretion of Court that

must be exercised judicially having carefully considered the facts and circumstances

of each case.

I shall now consider the factual circumstances of the first objection in light of the

abovementioned authorities.

Are the members of the Working Committee before Court?

It is admitted by all parties that in terms of the Constitution of the UNP marked P16,

the power of disciplinary control in respect of the members of the UNP is vested with

its Working Committee. It is further admitted by the Petitioner that the decision

reflected in P14 has been taken by the Working Committee. Therefore, it is the

Working Committee that will be in a position to explain to this Court the basis of such

expulsion. As P14 is being impugned, the members of the Working Committee had

to be named as Respondents to this application and are necessary parties to this

application.

In terms of Article 7 of the Constitution of the UNP marked P16, the Working

Committee of the UNP consists up to 92 members including its Leader, Deputy

Leader, Assistant Leader, General Secretary, National Organiser, Chairman,

Treasurer, and the other persons referred to in Article 7.

At the time this application was filed, the Petitioner had named the 2nd 34th

Respondents as constituting the working committee of the UNP. By naming as

Respondents, the persons whom the Petitioner believed were members of the

Working Committee, it is clear that the Petitioner is not disputing the fact that the

members of the Working Committee are necessary parties to this application.

Although it should have been clear to the Petitioner that in terms of P16 the

Working Committee consists of up to 92 members and that naming 32 members

appears to be insufficient, it does not appear that the Petitioner has made any

attempt to ascertain the names of the entire Working Committee prior to filing this

12

application. In any event, only 27 of the 2nd 34th Respondents are members of the

Working Committee.16 The result is that even though 27 members of the Working

Committee have been named as Respondents, the entirety of the Working

Committee have not been made parties to this application, a fact which has been

admitted by the Petitioner. This includes the Leader of the UNP, who signed the

letter of suspension marked P5, and whose name appears at the top of Article 7 of

P16. I must however observe that the Petitioner has reserved the right to add other

persons as respondents, although no specific mention has been made of adding

members of the Working Committee.

It was submitted further that upon being apprised that the membership of the

Working Committee is subject to alteration from time to time, and that all members

of the Working Committee have not been named as Respondents, the Petitioners

Attorney-at-Law, by letter dated 2nd November 2020 addressed to the 2nd

Respondent, sought to be furnished with the present membership of the Working

Committee. In response, the Chief Executive Officer of the UNP has provided the

names of forty persons who comprise the membership of the Working Committee.

Of those, 13 persons, including the Leader of the UNP, are not parties to this

application. The Petitioner had thereafter sought permission of this Court by a

motion dated 15th January 2021 to add the balance members as the 38th 50th

Respondents. The said motion is yet to be supported.

The above facts can be summarized as follows: a) The Petitioner was aware that the decision to expel him from the UNP was

taken by the Working Committee of the UNP;

b) The Working Committee therefore had to be named as parties to this

application;

c) The Petitioner did name 32 persons whom he believed were the members of

the Working Committee, although in reality the Petitioner has only named 27

members of the Working Committee;

16 The 12th, 26th, 27th, 31st, 32nd and 33rd Respondents are not members of the Working Committee.

13

d) It now transpires that there are more members of the Working Committee who

have not been named as Respondents.

e) The Petitioner had not made any attempt to inquire and find out who all the

members of the Working Committee were, prior to the issue of necessary

parties being raised by the 2nd Respondent;

f) Upon inquiry by letter dated 2nd November 2020, the Petitioner had been

informed by the Chief Executive Officer of the UNP that the Working

Committee consisted of forty members;

g) The Petitioner had made an application to this Court by motion dated 15th

January 2021, seeking permission to add those members of the Working

Committee who have not been made parties to this application;

h) The fact remains however that as at today, all members of the Working

Committee are not before Court.

It is in this factual background that the learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd

Respondent raised his first preliminary objection that this application is liable to be

dismissed in limine as all members of the Working Committee have not been named

as Respondents.

Substantial compliance by the Petitioner

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner, while admitting that it has now

transpired that all members of the Working Committee have not been made

Respondents, submitted that a majority of the members of the Working Committee

have in fact been named as Respondents, and therefore, the Working Committee

cannot be said to have been prejudiced by the failure to name a few of its members

as the reasons as to why the Working Committee decided to expel the Petitioner can

be placed before Court by those named as Respondents. In other words, it was his

position that there has been substantial compliance and the failure to name all

members of the Working Committee as Respondents is not fatal to the

maintainability of this application.

14

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted further that both

Arulsamy and Gnanasambanthan are distinguishable from the present case. In those

cases, none of the members of the Central Committee and the REPIA, who took the

decision were made parties to the case. The failure to name those parties was fatal

because there was a violation of the principles of Natural Justice in that those who

took the decision were not given an opportunity of being heard. He submitted that

the Petitioner has in any event sought permission of this Court at a very early stage

to add the other members as Respondents, and that there is no legal obstacle for this

Court to permit the said application, to cure their admitted failure to name all

members of the Working Committee as Respondents to this application.

Application to cure the defect

The Petitioner has relied on the case of Dominic v Minister of Lands and Others17 in

support of this position. In this case, at the stage of argument the Petitioner moved

to add the respondents as parties. Holding that the application to add parties is

belated, Sriskandaraja, J quoted the following passage from Principles of

Administrative Law in Sri Lanka:18

The failure to make a necessary party a respondent is fatal. If the omission is

discovered during the pendency of the application for the writ the Petitioner is

well advised to apply to court to add such party as a respondent. Such an

application for addition will be allowed only if the application is not yet ready

for final disposal by court; Vinnasithamby v. Joseph19. Once the final hearing of

the application by court commences, such an application made thereafter will

be refused; Goonetileke v. Government Agent, Galle20; Jamila Umma v.

Mohamed21, Dharmaratne v. Commissioner of Elections22.23

17[2010] 2 Sri LR 398. 18 S. F. A. Coorey; 2nd Edition at page 537 [See page 1120 of the 4th Edition]. 19 65 NLR 359. 20 47 NLR 549. 21 Supra. 22 52 NLR 429. 23See Ramasamy v. Ceylon State Mortgage Bank and Others [78 NLR 510], where the Minister who made the vesting order under the relevant Act in respect of the redemption of land was not made a party to the application for a writ of certiorari but was allowed to be added as a party respondent on an application made four years after the case was originally filed as the Court was concerned about the proprietary rights of the petitioner.

15

This would perhaps be an appropriate stage for me to refer to the judgment of the

Supreme Court in Kiriwanthe and another v Navaratne and another24 where the

issue was non-compliance with Rule 46 of the Supreme Court Rules of 1978 which

required a party to file along with the petition and affidavit, originals of documents.

The Supreme Court held as follows:

I am content to hold that the requirements of Rule 46 must be complied with,

but that strict or absolute compliance is not essential; it is sufficient if there is

compliance which is substantial - this being judged in the light of the object

and purpose of the Rule. It is not to be mechanically applied, as in the case now

before us; the Court should first have determined whether the default had been

satisfactorily explained, or cured subsequently without unreasonable delay, and

then have exercised a judicial discretion either to excuse the non-compliance, or

to impose a sanction; dismissal was not the only sanction. That discretion should

have been exercised primarily by reference to the purpose of the Rules, and not

as a means of punishing the defaulter.25

Mark Fernando, J remarked that:

"The weight of authority thus favours the view that while all these Rules must

be complied with, the law does not require or permit an automatic dismissal of

the application or appeal of the party in default. The consequence of

noncompliance (by reason of impossibility or for any other reason) is a matter

falling within the discretion of the Court, to be exercised after considering the

nature of the default, as well as the excuse or explanation therefor, in the

context of the object of the particular Rule.''

Should this Court exercise its discretion in favour of the Petitioner?

Although the above judgment was in relation to a Rule, and reflects the liberal

approach adopted by the Supreme Court in relation to compliance with the Rules of

the Supreme Court, a parallel can be drawn to the facts of this application. When

24[1990] 2 Sri LR page 393. 25 Ibid. at p 401.

16

confronted with an objection that a necessary party has not been named as a

respondent, Courts must exercise their discretion with care and with due regard to

all the surrounding facts and circumstances.

I am of the view that in this application, the discretion vested in this Court should be

exercised in favour of the Petitioner, for the following reasons:

a) There is substantial compliance by the Petitioner;

b) The failure to name all members of the Working Committee as Respondents is

not deliberate.

c) There is no allegation that the Petitioner picked and chose persons who were

favourable to him and named them as Respondents;

d) The failure to name all members of the Working Committee as Respondents

has not prejudiced those who have been named/not named as Respondents;

e) The reasons for the expulsion can still be placed before this Court by the

members who have been added as Respondents;

f) In any event, there is presently before me an application to add the other

members of the Working Committee;

g) The application has been made within a reasonable time period and at an early

stage of this case.

I must state that my conclusion may have been different if the impugned decision

had been taken by an individual and that person had not been named a party, or

there was no application to add necessary parties or the application to add necessary

parties had not been made in a timely manner.

Taking into consideration all of the above circumstances, I am of the view that this

application is not liable to be dismissed at this stage due to the failure to name as

Respondents all members of the Working Committee.

17

Is a political party amenable to the Writ Jurisdiction of this Court?

This brings me to the second preliminary objection raised by the learned Presidents

Counsel for the 2nd Respondent, that decisions of the Working Committee of the UNP

are not amenable to the Writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. This is a question of

jurisdiction and is the core objection relating to the maintainability of the Petitioners

application.

It would be helpful to begin with a reference to the historical development of the

scope and availability of judicial review. I would start with the often quoted words of

Atkin, J in the case of Rex v. Electricity Commissioners ex parte London Electricity

Joint Committee Co26 where it was held that the controls of judicial review may be

used wherever any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions

affecting the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act judicially, act in excess of

their legal authority.

While these words still cannot be jettisoned in its entirety, it is difficult to fit within

this formula, the full scope of judicial review as it stands in the modern day. For

instance, the duty to act judicially was reinterpreted by Lord Reid as early as 1964 in

Ridge v Baldwin,27 where it was considered a consequence of the power to

determine questions affecting rights, as opposed to an additional condition. This

view has been fortified by the subsequent exclusion and disuse of this limitation

imposed by the requirement of the duty to act judicially by Lord Diplock in the case

of OReilly v Mackman.28

The scope of judicial review has now expanded further to the actions of non-

statutory bodies. This is widely accepted after the landmark case of R v. Panel on

Take-Overs and Mergers, Ex parte Datafin plc. and another29 where it was held that

the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, part of the London Stock Exchanges system of

self-regulation which has no statutory or contractual basis, is subject to judicial

review, because it operates in the public sphere and exercises immense power de

26 [1924] 1 KB 171. 27[1964] AC 40. 28[1983] 2 AC 237 at 279. 29[1987] QB 815.

18

facto,30 and violations of the Take overs and Mergers Code, adjudged by itself, may

lead to exclusion from the London Stock Exchange or investigation by the

Department of Trade and Industry or other sanctions.31

In that case, Sir John Donaldson MR adopted the following formula which drastically

expanded the scope of judicial review:

Possibly the only essential elements are what can be described as a public

element, which can take many different forms, and the exclusion from the

jurisdiction of bodies whose sole source of power is a consensual submission to

its jurisdiction.32

The defining feature in the above formula however, is the reference to a public

element, which is considered a lenient threshold and invites litigants to apply for

judicial review in situations where otherwise they could find no legal foothold.33

The term public as stated in Ex parte Datafin plc, has been analysed in Judicial

Remedies in Public Law,34 as follows:

"Two approaches to the definition of "public" can be discerned in the Datafin

case. First, there is the extent to which the body operates under the authority of

the government or was established by the government or, presumably, by some

other recognized public authority. Secondly, there is the extent to which a

particular function is performed against a background of statutory powers even

though there is no specific statutory or prerogative authority for the power

which is sought to review. Both these approaches involve some link between the

government, or the legislature, and the body in question...The current approach

of the courts is to consider whether the body is woven into the fabric of public

regulation or governmental control of an activity or is integrated into a system

Forsyth, Administrative Law ( 11th Edition), Oxford University Press, page 377. 31Ibid. at page 540. 32 Ex parte Datafin plc (supra) at page 838. 33Ibid. 34 Clive Lewis, Judicial Remedies in Public Law (5th Edition, 2017), Sweet & Maxwell, at page 49.

of statutory regulation or, but for its existence, a governmental body would

have assumed control over the activity regulated by the body under challenge."

This position is aptly summarised in De Smiths Judicial Review35, as follows:

In the orthodox approach, the court assumes that the fact that the source of a

public authoritys power is statutory is in and of itself insufficient to make a

dispute about a contract amenable to judicial review; the court therefore goes

on to consider whether there is some additional sufficient public element,

flavour or character to the situation. A more straightforward approach (though

not one widely applied by the courts) would be to say that if the contractual

decision in issue involves that exercise of a statutory power, then in principle it

should be subject to judicial review and the court should consider whether any

of the grounds of review have been made out.

As in other contexts, in working out whether a decision is susceptible to judicial

review the court considers two main factors. It will have regard to the source of

the power under which the impugned decision is made. If this is purely

contractual, judicial review is unlikely to be appropriate; some close statutory

(or prerogative) underpinning of the contract will normally be needed.

Alternatively, the court may consider whether the function being carried out by

the defendant is a public function.

This Court, in Harjani and another v Indian Overseas Bank and others36 has affirmed

the developments discussed above, in Sri Lankan law. In this case, the Court

considered whether the 1st respondent, being a company which has not been

incorporated under any statute enacted in Sri Lanka, and discharging functions which

are not administrative in nature, is amenable to prerogative remedies. After

considering the developments in judicial review in this area, Saleem Marsoof, J

(P/CA)(as he then was) held as follows:

35 Harry Woolf, Jeffery Jowell, Catherine Donnelly, Ivan Hare, De Smiths Judicial Review [8th Edition, 2018] Sweet and Maxwell, page 148-149. See Kumuduni Madugalle v. National Housing Development Authority and others [CA(Writ) Application No. 540/2019; CA Minutes of 16th June 2020 per Samayawardhena, J].. 36[2005] 1 Sri LR 167.

20

The said Respondent has sought to take advantage of the provisions of the

Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act relating to parate execution.

In fact in terms of the said Act the 1st Respondent had the option of either

adopting a resolution under Section 4 to sell by public auction the property

mortgaged to it or authorize a person by resolution in terms of Section 5 of the

Act to take over possession to manage the said property and to utilize its

produce or profits for the settlement of the loan. These powers have been

conferred by the statute on any Bank as defined in Section 22 of the Act. The

Act lays down special procedures for the exercise of the powers conferred on

such Banks, and I am of the opinion that this Court is bound to exercise

supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of such powers despite the fact that

some at least of these Banks are local or foreign Banking companies.

The fact that a party performs characteristically public functions in itself does not

attract or justify judicial review for acts that involve them. Courts must consider

whether the impugned decision itself is one which is amenable to judicial review. In

Lanka Securities (Private) Limited v. Colombo Stock Exchange and Others, Janak De

Silva, J considered whether the role of the 1st respondent, Colombo Stock Exchange,

in the enforcement of the Rules framed in terms of its Articles to carry out an

investigation into trading in securities and financial transaction of stock brokers can

be impugned in judicial review proceedings, and held as follows:

In these circumstances, I have no doubt that the 1stRespondent is performing

public duties or exercising powers that can be characterized as "public" and as

such is subject to judicial review. But that is not the end of the analysis as Court

must ascertain the type of power that is impugned in these proceedings. Even

where public bodies are concerned there may be certain powers that are

derived solely through contract in which case there is no judicial review. For

example, in cases involving decisions of public bodies in relation to the dismissal

of their employees, if the power to dismiss can be seen to stem from the

contract of employment rather than any statutory or prerogative source, then

the issue can be viewed as simply a private law contractual matter not a public

law matter [R. v. East Berkshire Health Authority Ex. p. Walsh (1985) Q.B. 152].

De Silva, J went onto hold as follows:

21

although judicial review is not available in the context of purely contractual

powers, the authority of a contractual nature which various self-regulating

organizations have over their members help these organizations to perform

their public functions, and accordingly the failure of such an organization to

perform a contractual obligation may be subjected to judicial review [Harjani

and Another v. Indian Overseas Bank and Others37].

As was pointed out earlier, the SEC Act requires the rules of the 1st Respondent

to make satisfactory provision for investigating into trading in securities and

financial transactions of stock brokers and is an essential component of the

system of statutory regulation and the jurisdiction that the 1st Respondent

exercises over the Petitioner. Furthermore, in the instant matter it has a

statutory underpinning as well.

As pointed out above, the powers that the 1st Respondent exercised over the

Petitioner as one of its members is rooted in the SEC Act requirements that the

rules of a licensed stock exchange must provide for specific situations such as

investigating into trading in securities and financial transactions of stock

brokers. Therefore, the dispute between the Petitioner and the 1stRespondent is

not purely contractual. It has a statutory underpinning.

In this background, let me now consider whether the Working Committee is

amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd Respondent has cited the case of Y.P. de

Silva, General Secretary, SLMP and another v Raja Collure, Secretary, USA and

others38 in support of his position, where Sarath N. Silva J (as he then was), held as

follows:

A political party is a voluntary association of its members and is regulated by

its Constitution. Although there is considerable public interest in the activities of

political parties, they are essentially private organisations subject to the control

of the members and their decisions are made by the respective authorities

37 Supra. 38[1991] 2 Sri LR 323 at p 329.

22

under each constitution. They are unincorporated bodies of persons and are not

established under any statute. The Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 1of 1981

[section 7(1)] provides for the recognition of political parties for the purpose of

elections.This recognition by itself does not convert a political party into a

public authority.

The Constitution of the UNP can be considered something akin to the Articles of

Association of a Company. In the case of Mendis v. Seema Sahitha Panadura Janatha

Santhaka Pravahana Sevaya and Others39, the Court held that the legal force and

binding effect of a Companys Articles of Association is contractual, and is not

amenable to writ jurisdiction. The petitioner, who was the Managing Director of the

1st respondent Company, was removed from his post by the 3rd respondent Secretary

to the Treasury who held 50% of the shares in the 1st respondent. The Petitioner

sought judicial review on the basis that the 3rd Respondent did not follow the

provisions of Section 185(1) of the Companies Act which contains a general

procedural mechanism for the removal of a Director in any Company, and the

provisions of the Articles of Association of the 1st Respondent. Dismissing the

application of the petitioner, Sarath N. Silva, J (as he then was) held as follows:

It is clear these Writs come within the purview of administrative law which is a

branch of law that has been developed by courts for the control of the exercise

of governmental or statutory powers by mainly public authorities.... Writs of

Certiorari and Prohibition are instruments of Public Law to quash and restrain

illegal governmental and administrative action.

It is thus seen that prerogative remedies such as Certiorari and Prohibition lie in

situations where statutory authorities wielding power vested by Parliament

exercise these powers to the detriment of a member of the Public. The essential

ingredient is that a member of the public who is affected by such a decision

has to submit to the jurisdiction of the authority whose action is subject to

review. In other words, there is an unequal relationship between the authority

wielding power and the individual who has to submit to the jurisdiction of

that authority. The principles of Administrative Law that have evolved such as

the doctrine of ultra vires, error on the face of the record, rules of natural

39 [1995] 2 Sri LR 284.

23

justice, requirement of procedural fairness and the reasonableness of decisions,

coupled with the remedies by way of prerogative Writs, lie to correct any

illegality or injustice that may emanate from this unequal relationship. It is in

this context that the view has been firmly held that relationships that are

based on contract, without any statutory underpinning and actions of

companies and private individuals and bodies, are not subject to judicial

review by way of the Writs of Certiorari and Prohibition.

if the 3rd Respondent, as a member of the company has acted contrary to the

Articles of Association, he is in breach of a covenant signed and sealed by him.

It is a matter of Private Law and it cannot be the subject of judicial review in an

application for a prerogative Writ.

The power of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal to examine the legality of

an expulsion from a political party

It was submitted by the learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd Respondent that the

Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal have the power to examine the legality of

the expulsion of a Member of Parliament or a Member of a Provincial Council, as the

case may be, as specific provision to that effect has been provided. He submitted

further that the expulsion of a Member of Parliament is governed by the proviso to

Article 99(13)(a) of the Constitution, by which the member who has been expelled

from his political party or independent group has a right to apply to the Supreme

Court, which has the jurisdiction to consider if the expulsion is valid. Similarly, where

a Member of a Provincial Council has been expelled from the membership of his

political party, such member too has a right to challenge his expulsion by preferring

an application to the Court of Appeal in terms of Section 63 of the Provincial Councils

Elections Act.

It is important to note that apart from the specific provisions referred to above, a Member of Parliament or a member of a Provincial Council cannot invoke the Writ jurisdiction of this Court in order to challenge an expulsion. The Ordinance does not provide any specific mechanism to challenge the expulsion of a member of a local authority, either in the Supreme Court or in this Court. Therefore, the only mechanism available to the Petitioner is to seek a private law remedy by way of a District Court action.

24

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner has cited the case of Rambukwella

v United National Party40 in support of his position that this Court can consider

decisions of the Working Committee of a political party. This however was a case

which dealt with the expulsion of a Member of Parliament under the provisions of

Article 99(13)(a) of the Constitution. It is in this context that Chief Justice Sarath N.

Silva held as follows:

The submission of Mr. Choksy, as to the basic nature of a Political Party being

akin to that of a "club" and the relationship between the members and the

party being one of contract, a subject in realm of Private law, is correct.

However there is merit in Mr. Wijesinghe's submission that in the exercise of

the power of expulsion the matter transcends the realm of Private Law and

attracts the standard of review of the public law. A Political Party comes into

existence as a matter of private arrangement (contract) between persons who

have the object of gaining political power at elections but the character of such

Association alters to a certain extent after gaining recognition as a Political

Party, as provided in section 7 of the Parliamentary Elections Act No. 1 of 1981.

Section 7(4)(b) requires Secretary of a Political Party at the time of making an

application for recognition to furnish to the Commissioner of Elections a copy of

the Constitution of such Party and a list of its office bearers. Thus, a Political

Party which commences as a private Association gains statutory recognition in

reference to its Constitution with specific legal powers generally in regard to

Elections and it plays a vital role in the realm of Democratic Governance.

As a result of the expulsion by the Party the voters preferred candidate is

removed from his seat in Parliament and replaced by a candidate who at the

original election failed to obtain adequate preferential votes to gain election to

Parliament. In short the winning candidate is replaced by a candidate who has

lost, as a result of the expulsion. Thus in consequence of the expulsion not only

the member loses his seat in Parliament but also there is a subversion of the

preference indicated by the electors in exercising their franchise. In view of

these far reaching consequences I am inclined to agree with the submission of

Mr. Wijesinghe, that the standard of review of a decision of expulsion should

40[2007] 2 Sri LR 329 at pages 339-340.

25

be akin to that applicable to the review of the action of an authority

empowered to decide on the rights of persons in Public Law. Generally such

review comes with the rubric of Administrative Law.

It is clear that the reference to the franchise of the people was made only in

response to the submission that the standard of review that must be applied must be

akin to that applicable in Public law. The Supreme Court did not hold that an

expulsion of a member by a political party can be the subject matter of an

application under Article 140 and therefore, I am of the view that the reasoning in

Rambukwalle does not help the Petitioners argument.

Decisions of political parties are not amenable to the Writ jurisdiction of this Court

Having considered all of the above, I am of the view that the UNP, like all other

political parties is a private organisation with a Constitution that enables its efficient

and orderly functioning. Membership in a political party and all matters relating to

such membership is regulated and governed by its Constitution. Those who join the

UNP as members, voluntarily submit themselves to the authority and governance of

the Constitution of the UNP, and are thereafter bound by the provisions thereof. The

relationship that exists between the party and its members is therefore, contractual

and will always remain so. Where a member is in breach of the provisions of the

Constitution of a political party, to borrow the words of Justice Sarath N. Silva, such

member is in breach of a covenant signed and sealed by him.

The fact that a political party is registered in terms of the Parliamentary Elections Act

does not confer a statutory flavour to its Constitution vis--vis the contractual nature

of the relationship between the party and its members. Furthermore, the fact that

members of a political party may become public representatives performing public

functions upon being elected by the public, does not alter the contractual

relationship that such members have with the party, nor does it give the much

needed public element or the statutory flavour needed for the invocation of the Writ

jurisdiction of this Court. I therefore uphold the objection of the learned Presidents

Counsel for the 2nd Respondent that the Writ jurisdiction of this Court does not

extend to reviewing the decisions of the Working Committee of the UNP to expel the

Petitioner.

26

Is the 1st Respondent performing a Ministerial function?

The third objection raised by the learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd Respondent

is based on Section 10A of the Ordinance, which is re-produced below:

(1) If the elections officer of the district in which a local authority area is

situated, is satisfied that any person whose name has been included as a

candidate for election as a member of that local authority, in the

nomination paper of a recognized political party, has ceased to be a

member of that party, the elections officer shall, subject to the provisions

of subsection (2), by notice published in the Gazette declare that such

person-

a. has vacated his office of member, if he had been elected as a

member of that local authority; or

b. has forfeited his rights to have his name retained in the nomination

paper of that recognized political party for filling any casual vacancy,

and thereupon, such person shall vacate his office as member of that local

authority or the name of such person shall be expunged from the

nomination paper of that recognized political party, as the case may be, as

from the date on which such declaration is published in the Gazette.

(2) The elections officer shall not publish the notice referred to in sub section

(1) except after-

a. notice to such person and such recognized political party; and

b. expiry of a period of twenty-one days from the date of such notice.

Every such notice shall be sent by registered post.

(3) Whenever any person whose name has been included in the nomination

paper of a recognized political party ceases to be a member of such party

the secretary of that party shall furnish such information to the elections

27

officer of the district in which the local authority, to which that nomination

paper relates, is situated."

It was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd Respondent that the

1st Respondent exercises only a ministerial function in terms of Section 10A(1)(a) of

the Ordinance and that his actions are therefore not amenable to the writ

jurisdiction of this Court. In order to better appreciate the above submission, it is

appropriate to consider at this stage what is meant by a ministerial duty.

The terms Ministerial, Ministerial Act and Ministerial Duty are defined in

Black's Law Dictionary41 as follows:

Ministerial - Of, relating to, or involving an act that involves obedience to

instructions or laws instead of discretion, judgment, or skill; of, relating to, or

involving a duty that is so plain in point of law and so clear in matter of fact that

no element of discretion is left to the precise mode of its performance

Ministerial act An act performed without the independent exercise of

discretion or judgment. If the act is mandatory, it is also termed a ministerial

duty.

Ministerial duty A duty that requires neither the exercise of official discretion

nor judgment

In Gamini Atukorale v. Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections and

Others,42 Wijetunga, J quoted the following paragraph from The Principles of

Administrative Law by Jain and Jain:43

A ministerial function is one where the relevant law prescribes the duty to be

performed by the concerned authority in certain and specific terms leaving

nothing to the discretion or judgment of the authority. It does not involve

investigation into disputed facts or making of choices. The authority concerned

41 11th Edition. 42[1998] 3 Sri LR 206 at 219. 43 4th Edition; page 325.

28

acts in strict obedience to the law which imposes on it a simple and definite

duty in respect of which it has no choice.

In Seenithamby Palkiararajah v Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections

and Others,44 Nawaz, J referring to the above passage from Jain and Jain held that,

The thrust of the cases and the principle is that a ministerial function (performance

of duty as prescribed by the law and not a discretionary function) is not amenable to

the prerogative writ jurisdiction.

As stated in Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka:45

To perform a merely ministerial act is not to determine questions affecting a

party, and certiorari does not issue to quash a mere ministerial act.

The phrase to determine questions earlier meant to exercise power by

changing the legal position or legal relations of parties; from more recently, that

phrase also means, by otherwise adversely affecting them by coming to

adverse findings of fact or expressing adverse opinions. It is important to

emphasise that the phrase does not include any ministerial act because a

ministerial act contains no determination affecting anyone.

Section 10A of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance

The essence of the objection of the learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd

Respondent is that for the Returning Officer to act in terms of Section 10A(1), the

Returning Officer is not required make any determination, and that the Returning

Officer must only be satisfied that a candidate whose name appeared on the

nomination paper of a recognised political party has ceased to be a member of such

party. The manner in which he is satisfied of this fact is set out in Section 10A(3)

namely the intimation by the Secretary General of the political party that a member

of such party has ceased to be a member of such party. He submitted that the

Returning Officer is not required at this stage to probe further and ascertain the

44CA (Writ) Application No. 674/2009 [CA Minutes of 19th July 2018] 45 Supra.; page 931.

29

legality of the cessation of membership of such member, nor is he required to make

an independent decision.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd Respondent drew my attention to the

judgment of this Court in Farook v Siriwardena (Returning Officer)46 where an

almost identical situation had arisen. In that case, the petitioner had contested the

Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) at the elections held in 1991 as a candidate

of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and was declared elected as a member of the

CMC. Sometime later the 2nd respondent, the General Secretary of the Sri Lanka

Muslim Congress had informed the petitioner with a copy to the Returning Officer,

the 1st respondent, that he has been expelled from the Party with immediate effect.

On receipt of the letter, the 1st respondent served the petitioner notice in terms of

Section 10A(2) that he would be taking steps to publish a notice declaring that the

Petitioner has vacated his seat.

The petitioner contended that the purported expulsion is mala fide, unreasonable

and in breach of natural justice. He contended that a misrepresentation was made to

the elections officer and that the 1st respondent was misled into taking steps to

remove the petitioner from the membership of the party. The main submission on

the law was that the Elections Officer could not have under Section 10A of the

Ordinance proceeded to act solely on the letter of the secretary of the recognized

political party without himself having made further inquiries and being reasonably

satisfied, adopting the test of a reasonable man, that the petitioner has been

expelled from the party.

The petitioner sought a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1strespondent

to remove him from the membership of the CMC. He had also instituted an action in

the District Court of Colombo against the 2nd Respondent seeking a declaration that

the expulsion is null and void.

Noting that the petitioner cannot and does not in these proceedings seek to have the

legality or otherwise of his expulsion from the party determined, and in dismissing

the Petitioners application, the Court of Appeal held as follows:

46[1995] 2 Sri LR 124.

30

There is nothing in the above provisions to indicate that the elections officer

should himself take any further steps to ascertain whether the member has

been lawfully removed from the party, quite apart from the information

furnished by the secretary under section 10A (3) of the Ordinance. The elections

officer has a ministerial duty to perform on receipt of the information from the

secretary in strict obedience to the provisions contained in section 10A (1) and

(2) of the Local Authorities Election Ordinance.

I am of the view that there is no further duty cast on the elections officer on

receipt of information received from the secretary of the party that a member

has ceased to be a member of the party other than to firstly, give notice under

section 10A (2), and on the expiry of 21 days from the date of such notice to

proceed under section 10A (1) to declare by publishing in the Gazette that such

person has vacated his office as member of the local authority. The 1st

respondent has in this case strictly observed the provisions contained in section

10A of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance. The petitioner cannot

therefore succeed in this application.

Argument of the Petitioner

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner sought to rely on the following

paragraph from the recent judgment of this Court in Sadda Vidda Rajapakse Palanga

Pathira Ambakumarage Ranjana Leo Sylvester Alphonsu, Alias Ranjan Ramanayaka

v. Secretary General of Parliament and Another:47

The function the Secretary General performs when he arrives at the decision

that Article 89(d) is operative, in my view, is not purely ministerial. While it is

true that the Secretary General does not inquire into the validity of the

conviction, he is nonetheless required to make a determination or exercise

his judgment as to whether the Petitioner has in fact become subject to a

disqualification. In my view, the latter requires the Secretary General to give

his mind to the issue and the decision he arrives thereafter appears to me to

be subject to judicial review.

47CA (Writ) Application No. 52/2021; CA Minutes of 5th April 2021.

31

The abovementioned passage however came with a caveat which has not been

quoted by the Petitioner:

I must however admit that it is a very thin line that separates such a decision

from being ministerial and therefore outside the scope of judicial review as

opposed to a decision that is subject to judicial review.

In order to place in perspective the above conclusion, I would briefly refer to the four

statutory provisions which were considered in that case, namely Article 91(1)(a),

Article 89(d), Article 66(d) and Section 64 of the Parliamentary Elections Act.

While Article 91 specifies the disqualifications from being elected as a Member of

Parliament, Article 91(1)(a) provides that, No person shall be qualified to be elected

as a Member of Parliament or to sit and vote in Parliament, if he is or becomes

subject to any of the disqualifications specified in Article 89.

Article 89(d) reads as follows:

No person shall be qualified to be an elector at an election of the President, or

of the Members of Parliament or to vote at any Referendum, if he is subject to

any of the following disqualifications, namely

(d) if he is serving or has during the period of seven years immediately

preceding completed serving of a sentence of imprisonment (by whatever

name called) for a term not less than six months imposed after conviction

by any court for an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term not

less than two years or is under sentence of death or is serving or has during

the period of seven years immediately preceding completed the serving of

a sentence of imprisonment for a term not less than six months awarded in

lieu of execution of such sentence: .....

In terms of Article 66(d), The seat of a Member of Parliament shall become vacant if

he becomes subject to any disqualification specified in Article 89 or 91.

32

The cumulative effect of the above provisions is twofold. The first is that a person

who is subject to the disqualification in Article 89(d) is not qualified to be elected as a

Member of Parliament or to sit and vote in Parliament. The second is that the seat of

a Member of Parliament shall become vacant once he becomes subject to the

disqualification specified in Article 89(d).The consequential step upon the vacancy

arising as provided in Article 66 is set out in Section 64(1) of the Parliamentary

Elections Act in terms of which the Secretary-General of Parliament shall inform the

Commissioner (of Elections) who shall direct the returning officer of the electoral

district which returned such Member to fill the vacancy as provided for under

paragraph 13 (b) of Article 99 of the Constitution within one month of such direction.

In that case, the function of the Secretary General in terms of Article 89(d) was

explained in the context of the following two tiers.

(a) A determination by the Secretary General that an event has occurred that

triggers the disqualification set out in Article 89(d); and

(b) The communication of such determination by the Secretary General to the

Election Commission

Having done so, it was held as follows:

I shall start with the requirements of the first tier, namely, a determination by

the Secretary General that an event which triggers the disqualification set out in

Article 89(d) has occurred. In doing so, I must bear in mind that the events set

out in Articles 89 and 91 that results in a disqualification are wide and varied.

For example, in terms of Article 91(1)(c), a Member of Parliament is disqualified

from being a Member of Parliament if he is or becomes the President. Whether

the disqualification would apply in such a situation is straight forward and

requires no further consideration.

Having closely examined the provisions of Article 89(d) and taking into

consideration the facts of this application, it is clear that the following matters

must be satisfied for the disqualification in Article 89(d) to apply to the

Petitioner:

33

a) The Petitioner must be serving a sentence of imprisonment;

b) Such term of imprisonment must not be less than six months;

c) The said sentence must be imposed after conviction by any Court;

d) The said sentence must be imposed in respect of an offence;

e) The said sentence must be imposed in respect of an offence punishable

with imprisonment for a term not less than two years.

It is common ground that wide publicity was given to the conviction of the

Petitioner by the Supreme Court and the subsequent imprisonment to serve the

sentence imposed by the Supreme Court. The question that I must consider is

can or should the Secretary General act in terms of Section 64(1) on the basis

that a vacancy has arisen, the moment he reads about the said conviction? I do

not think so, for the reason that unlike some of the other events of

disqualification set out in Articles 89 and 91, the disqualification in Article 89(d)

is not triggered by a mere conviction for any offence. I say this for the reason

that the Secretary General must form the opinion or be satisfied that each of the

above elements of Article 89(d) which are relevant to this application has been

satisfied. I must stress, however, that in doing so, the Secretary General is not

assessing the validity of the conviction.

In other words, in this instance, prior to the obligation of the Secretary General

in terms of Section 64(1) being triggered, he must form the opinion or judgment

that the provisions of Article 89(d) have, in fact, been satisfied. In order to be

satisfied, the Secretary General must examine the judgment of the Supreme

Court and ensure that the requirements of Article 89(d) have been met by the

conviction. Only once he is able to do this, can he form an opinion that a

vacancy in terms of Article 66(d) has arisen.

It is only thereafter that this Court arrived at the conclusion with regard to the first

tier, which conclusion is relied upon by the Petitioner.

This Court thereafter went on to hold as follows with regard to the second tier:

34

In my view, once the Secretary General determines under the first tier that the

seat of a Member of Parliament has fallen vacant as a result of any

disqualification specified in Articles 89 or 91, then, Article 66(d) and Section

64(1) of the Act are triggered. It is mandatory for the Secretary General of

Parliament at that stage to inform the Election Commission of such fact, thus

enabling the Election Commission to take steps as provided in such Section.

It is only thereafter that it was held that:

..... the act of sending a communication to the Election Commission under

Section 64(1) of the Parliamentary Elections Act would tantamount to a physical

act by the 1st Respondent, short of an exercise of power. In other words, with a

vacancy staring in his face, the Secretary General has no option but is required

by law to inform the Election Commission of such vacancy. In doing so, he is

carrying out a purely ministerial act. I have already referred to the fact that the

exercise of a purely ministerial act is not subject to be quashed by a Writ of

Certiorari nor is such an exercise subject to any restriction by a Writ of

Prohibition. If the Secretary General fails to act at that stage, a Writ of

Mandamus would lie to compel him to perform his legal duty.

The 1st Respondent is performing a Ministerial function

The two tiers were explained in that case to illustrate that there first needed to be a

determination by the Secretary General that a vacancy has occurred before the

Secretary General could act on it, as the disqualification in Article 89(d) was not

straightforward. Applying the above analysis to this case, the role of the Secretary

General of Parliament under the first tier is akin to the role played by the 2nd

Respondent, the General Secretary of the UNP in this application. The role of the

Returning Officer in terms of Section 10A of the Ordinance is different, in that the

first tier determination of a vacancy has already been made by the 2nd Respondent

and has been communicated as per Section 10A(3) to the Returning Officer.

Furthermore, unlike the Secretary General who receives no information that a

vacancy has occurred in terms of Article 89(d), Section 10A(3) stipulates that

whenever any person ceases to be a member of such party the secretary of that

35

party shall furnish such information to the elections officer. It is upon this

communication that the Returning Officer must be satisfied of the vacancy and carry

out the ministerial function set out in Section 10A(1).

Therefore, I am of the view that the Returning Officer must act on the

communication of the Secretary of the party and therefore his duty begins at the

second tier explained above, which is Ministerial in nature and not subject to judicial

review. In the above circumstances, I uphold the third objection raised by the

learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd Respondent that the 1st Respondent is only

carrying out a ministerial function when he acts under Section 10A(1) and that such

action is not amenable to the Writ jurisdiction of this Court.

For all of the above reasons, I do not see any legal basis to issue formal notice of this

application on the Respondents. This application is accordingly dismissed, without

costs.
