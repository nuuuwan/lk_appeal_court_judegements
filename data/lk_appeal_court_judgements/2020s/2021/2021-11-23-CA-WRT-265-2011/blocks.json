Thus, the basic norms of fairness were grossly violated. The Petitioner verily believes that some of these documents were fabricated by interested persons to dissolve the Ethics Review Committee and get those Drug Trials approved. The Petitioner complained about this unjust treatment meted out to her by bringing this to the notice of FERCSL the umbrella organization named Forum of Ethics Review Committees, Sri Lanka by letter dated 27.01.2011. It was copied to Director Drug Regulatory Authority, President Sri Lanka Medical Council and Chairpersons of Ethics Review Committees of Colombo, Sri Jayawardenapura, Peradeniya and Ruhuna Medical Faculties to bring to their notice the scandalous affairs happening at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya and also to ensure that the proper guidelines relating to the ethical dimension in using human subjects are adhered to.",

Answering the averments contained in paragraphs 23 and 29 of the affidavits of the 24th and 26th Respondents, I state that the approval of the Ministry of Health for licensing the import of the drug to be used in clinical trial titled -A Phase 2 randomized, open-label (with blinded plasminogen activator and placebo control groups) study to evaluate the effects of different intra-thrombus infusion regimens of plasmin (human) compared to plasminogen activator and placebo in patients with acute lower extremity native artery or bypass graft occlusion- was granted only on 12.08.2011. Therefore, even if the Ethics Review Committee rushed in and granted approval notwithstanding the serious ethical issues involved, the clinical trials could not have been held simultaneously with the other countries. She specifically denies that she continuously postponed the decision to clear or reject the said research proposals. I state that the Ministry of Health independently raised the same concerns expressed by the Ethics Review Committee as regards this proposal as evident by the document marked X24 submitted with the affidavits of the 24th and 26th Respondents.",

These crimes included exposure of humans to extremes of temperature, the performance of mutilating surgery, and deliberate infection with a variety of lethal pathogens. During the trial, fundamental ethical standards for the conduct of research involving humans were codified into the Nuremberg Code, which set forth 10 conditions that must be met to justify research involving human subjects.

Unlike in the case of the Vice-Chancellor, or the Dean, no protection has been afforded to the post under consideration against arbitral dismissal. Since there are no statutory provisions either the director by a necessary implication suggesting how the chairperson of the Ethics Review Committee, should be removed from office or underpinning the position of chairperson of the Ethics Review Committee by restricting the freedom of the Dean to be dismissed, in my opinion, the public law rights are not available to the Petitioner.",

The application of the Petitioner seeking Writ of Certiorari and Mandamus is misconceived in fact and law. The Faculty Board of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Kelaniya has duly ratified the dissolution of the Ethics Review Committee headed by the Petitioner and the appointment of a new Ethics Review Committee. Therefore, the decisions challenged by the Petitioner are in fact decisions made within the legal parameters and there were compelling reasons to make the said decisions. The Petitioner has failed to seek a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the Faculty Board ratifying the decision of the 01st Respondent to appoint a new Ethics Review Committee.",

The decisions of the Faculty Board will only be subject to the writ jurisdiction of this Court in an instance, where the decision is ultra vires, irrational, unreasonable or arbitrary, none of the grounds which the Petitioner has established in the instant matter before this Court. In any event, the Petitioner has also failed to identify any statutory duty in seeking the said writ of mandamus which is a necessary condition precedent in seeking writs of mandamus. For the foregoing reasons, it is my considered view that the type of proceedings initiated by the petitioner to challenge the propriety of the decision of the Dean to terminate her services has been wrongly chosen from and out of the available remedies and thus misconstrued in law. In another word, the petitioner has boarded into a vehicle that cannot take her to the desired destination at all and therefore she is yet to identify an appropriate vehicle for her journey, to ensure that she is safely made to reach her desired destination. The application of the Petitioner is an action of private nature and therefore not governed by any statutes of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. As such the Petitioner is not entitled to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court.",
