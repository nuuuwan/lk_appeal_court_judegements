Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

The Petitioner states that he obtained membership in the iSudiys; uSrs.u jsYardu

jegqma ,nkakkaf.a kh iyk iuqmldr ius;sh in 2004. He states that since obtaining

membership, he served as a member of the Working Committee of the said Society

until 2008. The Petitioner had also held the office of Assistant Secretary and Vice

Chairman of the said Society at different times. Due to ill health, the Petitioner had

stepped down in 2008 from all posts that he held at that time. The Petitioner had

been re-appointed to the Working Committee of the said Society in July 2011 and

had been appointed as its Secretary soon thereafter.

The Petitioner admits that the 1st Respondent, the Commissioner of Co-operative

Development and Registrar of Co-operative Development, acting in terms of the Co-

operative Societies Statute of the Western Province (the Statute) appointed the 5th

Respondent to conduct an investigation into the activities of the said Society.

Pursuant to the said investigations, the Petitioner had been issued with a charge

sheet marked P2 by which it was alleged that the Petitioner had obtained a sum of

Rs. 21,050 as an allowance for acting in the office of Secretary during the period

January 2007 December 2007, without having obtained the necessary approvals.

The response of the Petitioner to the charge sheet is marked P3.

The Petitioner states that by letter dated 9th September 2013 marked P5, the 1st

Respondent had informed him that having considered the aforementioned response

of the Petitioner, a decision has been taken by the 1st Respondent to remove the

Petitioner from his membership in the Working Committee of the said Society. The

1st Respondent had further informed the Petitioner that he would not be eligible to

hold office in a Co-operative Society for a period of seven years from 9th September

2013.

Aggrieved by the said decision in P5, the Petitioner filed this application seeking

inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to quash the said decision of the 1st Respondent.

The Petitioner does not deny the fact that he in fact received the said payment but

states that what was paid to him was not a salary but an allowance. The learned

4

Counsel for the Petitioner submitted further that the Petitioner has not acted

fraudulently when he accepted the said payment. In this regard, I must note that the

Respondents are not alleging any fraud on the part of the Petitioner but only that the

necessary approvals were not obtained.

The learned Senior State Counsel for the Respondents submitted that in terms of By-

law 4.7.2, a person holding the office of Secretary could not accept any payment if he

is a member of the Working Committee and that as the Petitioner, admittedly, was a

member of the Working Committee during the period that the allowance was paid,

the Petitioner was not entitled to the said allowance.

The learned Senior State Counsel for the Respondents also drew the attention of this

Court to Rule 22(i) of the Rules marked R10 made in terms of Section 61 of the Co-

operative Societies Act, which reads as follows:

,shdmosxps l< iuqmldr ius;shl ldrl iNdfjs idudcslfhl=g jegqma uqo,a, mdrsf;daYsl uqo,a fyda fjk;a mdrsY%uslhla ,nd.ekSug mq,qjka jkafka uyd iNdfjs mQraj wkque;sh

we;sj;a frcsiag%dra;=ud jsiska kshu lrk m%udk wkqj;a muKlah

It is clear that the nature of the payment is not limited to a salary and that the

payment of even an allowance must be in terms of the above Rule. The issue that

needs to be considered therefore is whether the necessary approvals have been

obtained prior to making the said payment. The Petitioner states that on 12th

December 2005, the Working Committee of the Society approved a payment of Rs.

5000, 3500 and 3000 for the Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer, respectively. The

Petitioner states further that at the Annual General Meeting of the Society held on

24th January 2006, a payment of Rs. 5000, 1000 and 5000 were approved for the

Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer, respectively. The Petitioner states that even

though covering approval of the Assistant Commissioner of Co-operative

Development was sought by letter dated 27th July 2006, approval was not received. It

is therefore clear that the payment of the allowance was not in conformity with the

above Rule. Therefore, the issuance of the charge sheet and the subsequent findings

against the Petitioner is not illegal.

5

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner also submitted that even though in terms of

Section 48 of the Co-operative Societies Statute of the Western Provincial Council

No. 3 of 1998, as amended by Statute No. 4/2011, the reply of the Petitioner to the

charge sheet must be submitted by the 1st Respondent to the Board of Review

appointed under the Co-operative Societies Law, the Respondents have failed to do

so. The learned Senior State Counsel drew my attention to the Report of the Board of

Review marked R10 which has specifically considered the response of the Petitioner

and recommended that the punishment conveyed to the Petitioner by P5 be

imposed.

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that the Petitioner is not entitled to the

relief prayed for. This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
