    "text": "The address of the petitioner according to the caption of his own petition is no. 29/18, Bodhipihituwala, Horampalla, Minuwangoda. In his letter of appointment marked P02 the same address is mentioned and the letter had been delivered to that address. In addition the national identity card no. of the petitioner is also mentioned in P02. That means the superintendent of transport who had signed the letter of appointment or a subordinate had checked the identity card of the petitioner. Therefore in all probability the address mentioned there should be the address mentioned in the national identity card which is also the address mentioned in the caption of this case. Therefore one can come to the conclusion that the petitioner is living in Minuwangoda postal area. But in the statement to the police given by the accused in the Ganja case marked 1R5 the address is mentioned as 28/18, Bodhipihituwala, Horampalla, Divulapitiya. Divulapitiya is not the postal area where the petitioner resided. If someone else had made use of the missing identity card of the petitioner to commit this offence and plead guilty in court and produced same at the police station or before the officer who recorded his statement, that officer may not have mentioned his postal area as Divulapitiya while recording his address. Instead it should have been recorded as Minuwangoda. That shows that the missing identity card of the petitioner had not been produced at the police station. There is a photograph of the holder in an identity card and it is very unlikely that someone else would produce it to a police officer without the fear of getting detected when there is no necessity to produce an identity card. One can always say that you do not possess it at the moment. Had the police officer examined the identity card one would expect him to record the ID number in the statement. But it had not been done. Therefore when all these factors are taken into consideration it is more probable to come to the conclusion that the lost or missing identity card of the petitioner had not been produced to the police by the person who had committed that offence. The missing identity card had not been used by someone to commit this offence and plead guilty to the charge in court.",

    "text": "contention. Instead the test of probability leads to the opposite conclusion. The petitioner had been on leave on 21.03.2011, 22.03.2011 and 23.03.2011. On the 21st and 22nd he was on sick leave and on the 23rd he had taken his day off. According to the proceedings in the Magistrates Court marked 1R6 the suspect Hewa Pedige Chandra Kulasooriya had been arrested and produced before the Magistrate on 22.03.2009 and remanded till 23.03.2009. The plaint was filed on 23.03.2009 and the accused had pleaded guilty to the charge and was fined Rs. 30,000.00. These two dates coincide with the dates on which the petitioner was on leave 21,22 and 23 March. If you keep away the 21st for travelling to Mawussakale from Minuwangoda the suspect was arrested on the 22nd and fined on 23rd. The petitioner was on leave on these three days. I have come to the conclusion that the missing identity card of the petitioner was not produced at the police station by the suspect. A person who was altogether unknown to the petitioner could not have given the petitioners previous name and the address to the police. If someone else other than the petitioner gave the aforesaid name and address to the police he should be a person known to the petitioner. If that person did not have any animosity towards the petitioner there is no reason for him give the name and the address of the petitioner implicating him. Instead he could have given a different fictitious name and an address. If that person who gave petitioners name and address to the police bore ill will towards the petitioner and if he intended to put the petitioner in trouble he had every opportunity to give the petitioners new name and the correct postal address. There is no necessity for him to give petitioners previous name and a wrong postal area. On the other hand if the petitioner was the person who was arrested at Mawussakale he had a reason to give his earlier name to the police instead of giving his new name. He also had the same reason to give a different postal station Divulapitiya instead of giving his correct postal station Minuwangoda. That is to prevent further detection and conceal the incident from all those who are concerned.",
