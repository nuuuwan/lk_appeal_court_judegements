Counsel : Vidura Gunarathna with Warna Dahanayake for the 1st 4th Petitioners

Milinda Gunetilleke, ASG for the Respondents

Supported on: 14.07.2021

Decided on: 26.07.2021

Sobhitha Rajakaruna, J.

The 1st Respondent Ceylon Electricity Board ("CEB") published an advertisement inviting

proposals from prospective developers (project proponents) through international

competitive bidding ("ICB")for development of Solar PV Power Plants of total capacity of

150MW, AC on Build, Own and Operate (BOO) basis to be connected at the grid

substations mentioned in the said advertisement, which is marked as P5. In terms of the said

advertisement a project proponent should purchase a separate Request For Proposals

("RFP") for each proposal tendered, on submission of written request and payment of non

refundable fee of Rs. 100,000/-. The proposals prepared according to instructions in Section

Page 8 of 12

2.10 Volume 1 of the RFP document and addressed to the Chairman of the Cabinet

Appointed Negotiation Committee ("CANC"), should be submitted to the office of the

Deputy General Manager during the time period mentioned in the said advertisement. The

Petitioners of the instant case also submitted proposals separately with regard to respective

grid substations.

The Petitioners, among other documents, have submitted their proposal letters using a

format as per the document marked P36. However, the Secretary to the Ministry of Power

by his letters marked as P23, P24, P25, P29, P30, P31, P32, P33, P34 and P35 has informed

the respective Petitioners that their bid had not been selected for the purpose of awarding

the tender. The reason given for non responsiveness of their bids is that certain changes have

been made by the Petitioners to the contents of the 3rd paragraph of the proposal letter which

is ought to be submitted in terms of the RFP.

In other words, the reason to consider the Petitioner's bids as non-responsive by the

Respondents, was that the 3rd paragraph of the Proposal Letter submitted by the Petitioners

was different to the sample letter provided by the CEB in its RFP No.

TR/RED&PM/ICB/2019/001/C (RFP).

The 3rd paragraph of the proposal letter submitted by the Petitioners reads as follows;

"On acceptance of the Letter of Invitation the undersigned shall extend the proposal Security and agrees

to execute the Power Purchase Agreement for the provision of the facility to be financed, designed,

constructed, commissioned, operated and maintained by a Project Company of the undersigned."

However, the 3rd paragraph of the specimen proposal letter provided in Volume II, Section

A of the RFP states as follows;

"On acceptance of the Letter of Award the undersigned shall submit a Performance Security (Bond) in

the form of a Bank guarantee to an amount of LKR Ten Million (LKR 10,000,000/-) per MW, AC

and agrees to execute the Power Purchase Agreement for the Provision of the Facility to be financed,

designed, constructed, commissioned, operated and maintained by a Project Company of the

undersigned."

The Petitioners particularly in paragraph 97 of their affidavit filed along with the Petition

affirm that the above difference was a typing mistake and was a genuine oversight and lapse

Page 9 of 12

caused by Petitioners having inadvertently utilized the draft proposal letter template that

had previously been published by the CEB (1st Respondent) in their RFP for Tender

'Establishment of Sixty (60) Solar Power Plants of 01MW',marked as P36.

Moreover, the Petitioners submit that they had taken steps to lodge appeals to the Chairman

of the Procurement Appeals Board (14th Respondent), Secretary Ministry of Power (6th

Respondent) and General Manager of CEB (3rd Respondent).It is observed that by virtue of

Clause 8.4 of the Supplement 24 to the Procurement Manual issued on 21.03.2012 [to be

used along with Procurement Guidelines (Goods & Works)], after investigating into

representations made in the Appeal, the Procurement Appeal Board (PAB), shall submit its

independent report to the Cabinet of Ministers for its decision.

The attention of this Court was drawn by the Respondents to Clause 6.2 of the RFP

(marked as 'P61g') by which CEB reserves the right to reject the proposal of any project

proponent who has qualified on the basis of fraudulent, suppressed, or incomplete

information. Project proponents who submit proposals do so without recourse against

Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) or CEB or their representatives for their rejection by

CEB or failure to execute a PPA for any reason whatsoever.

Now the question that has to be examined is whether the Petitioners have caused only a

minor deviation in the letter P36 in contrast to the specimen letter marked as 'P36a'. The

Petitioners argue that the mistaken words in paragraph 3 of P36 was a minor deviation,

whereas the Respondent's contention is that it is a major deviation which comes under

clause 4.3 (i) of the RFP.

The document marked 'P36a' is the format of the proposal letter for the subject tender given

in page 44 of Volume II of the RFP. In terms of the 3rd paragraph of the said letter it is

mandatory for the project proponent, on acceptance of the letter of award to submit a

Performance Security (bond) in the form of a bank guarantee to an amount of Rs. 10

million, whereas, in the document marked P36 the project proponent is not undertaking to

submit such a performance security.

The Petitioners in paragraph 115 of their affidavit further affirm that the corrected proposal

letter as per in the format of the RFP was annexed to their appeal submitted to the 14th, 6th

Page 10 of 12

and 3rd Respondents. Therefore, it is obvious that the document marked 'P36a' has never

been submitted by the Petitioners along with their proposal letters during the tender process.

The clause 6.3 (i) of the aforesaid RFP (marked as 'P61g'), categorically prescribes that non-

submission of duly completed proposal letter signed by the authorized person and the

original of the certificate of purchase of RFP will be considered as a major deviation and

such proposal will not be considered for further evaluation. Further, the said clause 6.3

declares that if a proposal is found to be non-responsive it will be rejected and may not

subsequently be made responsive by correction or withdrawal of the item which resulted in

the disqualification and/or rejection.

By examining carefully, the contents of the 3rd paragraph of P36 and P36a, this court cannot

accept the proposition made by the Petitioners in paragraph 97 of their affidavit for this

Court to arrive at a conclusion that it was a typing mistake or its is a minor deviation as

affirmed therein by those Petitioners.

Additionally, the Petitioner strenuously argued, based on the provision of clause 7.8 of the

Government Procurement Guidelines (P-61b), that the bids submitted by the Petitioners

were not rejected at the initial stage. The Petitioners contention is that they were successful

at stage 1 that is mentioned in the said clause 7.8(a). However, this court observes that the

said clause 7.8 deals with general principles of bid examination. The Respondents contend

that the subject bids have been rejected at the threshold stage and the process has not

reached the second stage evaluation that is mentioned in clause 6.4 of RFP at the time of

issuing the letters marked P23, P24, P25, P 29, P30, P31, P32, P33, P34 and P35.

Furthermore, the attention of the Court was drawn by the Respondents to paragraph 5 of

the Cabinet decisions dated 08.02.2021 (marked as P62) which declares the approval of the

Cabinet of Ministers in relation to the subject tender process. The said paragraph 5 is as

follows:

"Approval of the Cabinet of Ministers has been granted to implement the procurement process for

initiating solar power plants with a capacity of 150 mega watt each in various places in the island.

Accordingly, approval at the meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers was granted on 14th December 2020

for awarding contracts to the procurements to which appeal had not been arisen against the

recommendations of the negotiating committee appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers by inviting

Page 11 of 12

international competitive bids under 05 packages. The procurement appeals board has denied the

appeals furnished in relation to rest of the procurements. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers

approved the proposal submitted by the Minister of Electricity for awarding the relevant procurements

to selected bidders for the Grid Sub-Stations of Anuradhapura, Habarana, Matara, Galle, Deniyaya,

Kosgama, Mathugama, Pannala, Mahawa and Kurunegala for a period of 20 years" (emphasis

added)

It is important to note that the Petitioners inter alia seek for a mandate in the nature of a writ

of Certiorari quashing the said Cabinet decision marked as P62. Therefore, it is necessary to

ascertain as to whether the Petitioners have established any valid ground for judicial review

upon the said cabinet decision or any other impugned decisions.

Lord Brightmen in Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v. Evans(1982) 1 WLR 115,

emphasized the fact that Judicial review, as the words imply, is not an appeal from a decision, but

a review of the manner in which the decision was made. If the decision making process is flawed

for illegality, irrationality, and procedural impropriety such decision is amenable to writ

jurisdiction (also see page 12 of the order of this court in CA (Writ) Application No. 63/2020

CA minutes 07.07.2020). Hence, we take the view that it is the duty of the Petitioners in the

instant case to make out a prima facie case establishing the decision-making process of

refusing to award the tender to the Petitioners, is flawed under such grounds mentioned

above.

The interpretation given upon the words prima facie case in Ginadasa v. Weerasignhe, 31

NLR 33 by Dolten, J. is apt here. Accordingly, "the court must be satisfied that there is a serious

case to be tried at the hearing and that on the facts before it there is a probability that plaintiff is entitled

to relief." The test for prima facie case in applications for judicial review should be similar.

The vitiating ground must be arguably material to the impugned decision. That decision

must be arguably amenable to judicial review- See R v. Chief Rabbie ex. p. wachmann (1993)

2 All ER 249.

In the instant application the Petitioners have admitted that it was a typographical error or a

mistake to submit the wrong proposal letter and thereupon it is observed that the

Respondents had no option other than disregarding the proposals made by the Petitioners in

terms of the provisions of the RFP. Therefore, this court takes the view that the Petitioners

Page 12 of 12

have not made out an arguable case or a prima facie case for this court to issue notice.

Therefore, I refuse notice and dismiss the application.
