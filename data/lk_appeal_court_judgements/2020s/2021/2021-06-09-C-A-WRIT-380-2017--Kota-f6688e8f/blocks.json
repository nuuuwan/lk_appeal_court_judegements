The latter has not been so treated and it is legitimate to hold that the legislature did not intend to remove the Courts power of scrutiny. Another important fact is that section 38 circumscribed the Ministers power to interfere with private rights of property by stating that possession can only be interfered with after an award is made. It is only in cases of urgency that an exemption is made. To my mind this is a clear indication, that the Minister was only permitted to act with due regard to Common Law rights. When Common Law rights are involved the Court always has a right of review. 5 Thus, it is clear that this Court can consider whether the Minister acted reasonably when he arrived at the decision that immediate possession of the land leased to the Petitioner must be taken over on the ground of urgency. This brings me to the submission of the learned Senior State Counsel that the Respondents need not prove urgency, and that the burden of establishing there was no urgency lies with the Petitioners.

    "text": "shift to the landowner to rebut that inference. Therefore, I cannot agree with the submission of the learned Senior State Counsel that the Minister owes no duty to prove urgency, and that the duty to establish there was no urgency is with the Petitioners. The issue with regard to the burden of proof has been conclusively dealt with by the Supreme Court in Horana Plantations Ltd v. Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation,8 where it was held that No doubt primarily the Minister decided urgency. He it is who is in possession of the facts and his must be the reasoning. But the Courts have a duty to review the matter. This brings me back to the submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that there is no urgency to take over possession of the land and that the decision to deprive the Petitioner of the safeguards available under Section 4 is illegal and arbitrary. Pursuant to R5, Sri Lanka Police has made a formal application dated 10th March 2016 marked R6 seeking the acquisition of the land that is the subject matter of this application. I have examined R6 and observe that Sri Lanka Police has been of the view that the land is owned by the Land Reform Commission. This is erroneous in that the land has been vested in the 6th Respondent and has thereafter been leased to the Petitioner, who is carrying out a successful rubber cultivation on the said land. Furthermore, it has been pointed out in R6 that there is no other suitable land in the said area for the said purpose whereas the Petitioner states that it can offer unproductive land from the said Sorana Estate to Sri Lanka Police. In my view, the very fact that the standard application form that must be filled by an entity seeking acquisition of private land requires such entity to specify if alternative land is available is proof that the availability of alternative land for the proposed public purpose is a relevant factor in deciding whether the land identified should be acquired. The Section 2 notice having been published on 13th July 2016, it took over a year for the Section 38 proviso (a) notice to be published. The only activity that took place during that period was the surveying of the land on 18th August 2016.

There is one other matter that I must advert to. The learned Senior State Counsel submitted that the possession of the land has already been handed over to the 1st Respondent by the officials of the Land Reform Commission. However, as I have already referred to, the Minister of Lands and Mahaweli Development has made an order in terms of Section 27A of the Land Reform Commission Law vesting Sorana Estate in the 6th Respondent. It has been held in Balangoda Plantations PLC vs Janatha Estates Development Board and Others9 that in view of the provisions of Sections 27A(1) (3), title of the Land Reform Commission stands transferred to the 6th Respondent upon the said Order being published in the Gazette and that the Land Reform Commission does not have any legal authority thereafter over the agricultural and estate lands vested in the 6th Respondent. In any event, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the Petitioner continues to be in possession of the land. This appears to be correct as the learned Senior State Counsel submitted that even though an interim order has not been issued, steps have not been taken to develop the said land in deference to this Court. In the above circumstances, I issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing P14. If the necessity for the aforementioned public purpose still exists, the Respondents may take immediate steps in terms of Section 4 of the Act, prior to taking a decision in terms of the law. I make no order with regard to costs.",
