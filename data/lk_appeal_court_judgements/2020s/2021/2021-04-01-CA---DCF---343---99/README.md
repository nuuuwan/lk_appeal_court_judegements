Introduction:

These appeals have been preferred by the 12th, 14th, 59th, 63A, 65th, 6A

and lOA Defendant-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

"Defendants") from the judgment of the learned District Judge of

Awissawella dated 17.12.1998.

When these appeals were taken up for argument, the learned Counsel

appearing for both parties consented to dispose of the appeals by way of

Written Submissions that have already been tendered.

The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the "Plaintiff')

instituted the above action l to partition the corpus, which is morefully

described in the schedule to the amended plaint, amongst the co-owners.

After trial, the learned District Judge delivered the impugned judgment on

17.12.1998.

Being aggrieved by the judgment, the aforesaid Defendants have preferred

these appeals.

There is no dispute as to the identification of the subject matter.

Admittedly, the lots 1 to 9 in the Preliminary Plan bearing No. 1235 dated

28.06.1960 made by S.R. Yapa, Licensed Surveyor (marked as 'PI) are

the corpus sought to be partitioned in this case.

The Defendants those who have preferred appeals against the impugned

judgment are disputing the shares allotted by the learned District Judge.

Hence, I sh all now ascertain as to whether the pedigree upon which the

shares were allotted to the parties by the learned trial Judge is correct.

In terms of the evidence adduced and the title Deeds produced at the trial,

the original owners of the land sought to be partitioned were

Jamuthupedige Dineththu (1/2), Manika (1/4) and Jamuthupedige

I This action was instituted in the Distict Court of Awissawella in 1960, sixty years ago, to partition the subject matter amongst the co-owneers.

sethuwa (1/4). On the demise ofthe said Jamuthupedige Dineththu (1/2),

his rights devolved on his children, namely Pina, Murukkuwa, Punchi

Baiya and Subaamali. The said Murukkuwa and Punchi Baiya died

issueless and Subaamali went out in Diga, and therefore, the said Pina

became entitled to the entire rights of Jamuthupedige Dineththu (1/2).

Thereafter, Pina died, leaving three children, namely Siriya (from the 1st

marriage), Hathan Kira and Hawadiya (from the 2nd marriage). The said

Siriya by Deed bearing No. 5398 dated 12.10.1935 marked PI conveyed

her rights to Punchi Mahathaya who transferred his rights to Hendrick

Singho by Deed No. 1176 dated 27.11.1950 marked P2. The said Hendrick

Singho conveyed the said rights to the 1st Plaintiff (1/8) and the 2nd

Plaintiff (1/8) by Deed No. 10363 dated 19.08.1953 marked P3.

The aforesaid Hathan Kira (1/8) transferred the said rights to Pavulis

Appuhamy by Deed No. 5125 dated 18.08.1934 marked 1V1 who

conveyed that right to Baby Hamu by Deed No. 3020 dated 25.10.1940

marked 1 V2. The said Baby Hamu gifted undivided 7/40 shares (7/40 out

of 1/8) to Anginahamine Rodrigo and Liyang Singho Appuhamy by Deed

of Gift bearing No. 4158 dated 04.05.1942. The said Anginahamine

Rodrigo and Liyang Singho Appuhamy conveyed their rights to Don

Abraham Wickramaingha by Deed No. 6130 dated 01.05.1943 who

transferred the said rights to Baby Nona by Deed No. 10303 dated

22.09.1950 marked 1 V3 who transferred the same to Johanahamy by

Deed No. 14025 dated 01.02.1956 marked 1V4 who conveyed the said

rights to the 1st Defendant by Deed No. 789 dated 10.01.1951 marked

1 V5. On the demise of the aforesaid Babyhamu, her remaining rights

devolved on her heirs, namely the 5th to 10th Defendants.

The aforesaid Havadiya conveyed his rights (1/8) to Siriya by Deed bearing

No. 13990 dated 27.10.1928 marked 22V1 who conveyed the same to the

22nd Defendant by Deed No. 4710 dated 23.11.1942 marked 22V2.

Upon the demise of the second original owner, Manike (1/4), her rights

devolved on her children, Sethuwa (1/8) and Adara (1 /8). Sethuwa's rights

devolved on her surviving children, Kiribalaya (1 / 16) and Upendra (1/16)

Pg. 4 of 12

upon her death. Kiribalaya died issueless, and therefore, the said Upendra

became entitled to the entire rights of Sethuwa. The said Upendra by Deed

bearing No. 11982 dated 20.10.1954 marked 2V 1 conveyed his rights to

the 2nd Defendant and Babby. As Babby died issueless, the 2nd Defendant

became entitled to the entire rights of the said Sethuwa (1/8).

The aforesaid Adara's rights devolved on her children, Kira (1/16) and

Pinsethuwa (1/16). The said Kira by Deed bearing No. 14368 dated

13.01.1930 marked 11V1 conveyed his rights to Babyhamy (1/32) and

Saadirissingho (1/32). On the demise of the said Babyhamy her rights

devolved on her heirs, namely the 5th to lOth Defendants. The 6th

Defendant by Deed bearing No. 14444 dated 12.10.1956 marked 11V2

conveyed his rights to the 11th Defendant. The said Saadirissingho's rights

devolved on the 11th Defendant upon his death. Upon the demise of the

aforesaid Pinsethuwa her rights (1/16) devolved on her children, namely

the 17th Defendant (1/48) and two sons who have not been made parties

to the action, and therefore, the rights of the said two sons should be made

unallotted (2/48).

On the demise of the third original owner, Jamuthupedige Sethuwa (1/4),

his rights devolved on his children, namely Kirihathanee (1/8) and Pinthu

(1/8). The said Kirihathanee's rights devolved on her children,

Kiriwasthuwa, Hurathala and Pinaadara. As the said Kiriwasthuwa and

Pinaadara went out in Diga, the said Hurathala became entitled to the

entire rights of the said Kirihathanee. The said Hurathala died, leaving

two children, namely Omariya and Ukkuthina who have conveyed their

rights to Thennamalee by Deed No. 5625 dated 14.01.1897 marked 12V1.

On the demise of the said Thennamalee her rights devolved on her

children, namely Kiribandu, Hathankira, Babby, Assandamalee and

Hurathalmally. The said Kiribandu's rights devolved on his children,

namely Salochina and Babaya and both of them by Deed bearing No. 2362

dated 13.08.1956 marked 19V1 (an extract from the land registry)

conveyed their rights to the 19th Defendant (1/60).

Pg. 5 of 12

The said Hathankira by Deed No. 25915 dated 06.12.1948 marked 12V2

transferred his rights to Siriya who conveyed the same to the 12th

Defendant by Deed No. 32214 dated 10.11.1949 marked 12V3. The

aforesaid Babby, Assandamalee and Hurathalmally by Deed bearing No.

13729 dated 03.12.1928 marked 6V1 transferred their rights to

Appusingho who conveyed the same to Babyhamy by Deed No. 3020 dated

25.10.1940 marked 6V2. On the demise of the said Babyhamy her rights

devolved on her children, namely the 5th to 10 Defendants.

The aforesaid Pinthu's rights (1 /8) devolved on his children, namely

Ukkuwa, Kiribaby, Kirihathana and Manika an undivided 1/32 shares

each. The said Manika died, leaving four children, namely Kiribaba,

Kirisonda, Ananda and Laisa. Kiribaba conveyed his rights to Punchihamy

by Deed No. 3402 dated 20.01.1915 marked 16V1 who transferred the

same to the 16th Defendant by Deed No. 740 dated 19.08.1935 marked

16V2. Since, the aforesaid Kirisonda, Ananda and Laisa are not made

parties to the action, their rights are to be made unallotted. According to

the evidence adduced, the rights of the said Ukkuwa, Kiribaby and

Kirihathana devolved on Surangtha, Ayada, Malmada and Kiribada.

Surangtha's rights devolved on Sethuwa and Punchikira. Sethuwa

conveyed his rights to the 22nd Defendant by Deed No. 5539 dated

16.02.1943 marked 22V3. Punchikira's rights devolved on his children,

namely the 30th and 34th Defendants. On the demise of the said Ayada her

rights devolved on her children, namely Siriya, Pinsonda, Sakrithy and

the 57th Defendant. The said Siriya, Pinsonda and Sakrithy transferred

their rights to Podinona by Deed No. 8939 dated 13.09.1920 marked

27V1. As the said Podinona is not a party to this action her rights are to

be made unallotted. The said Kiribada's rights devolved on his heirs,

namely Jema, Suwanda and the 13th Defendant. Jema conveyed her rights

to the 23rd Defendant by Deed No. 7498 dated 24.06.1946. As the said

Suwanda is not a party to this action her rights are to be made unallotted.

The learned District Judge, in terms of the oral and documentary evidence

adduced, has allotted shares of the subject matter to the co-owners2.

I shall now consider the grounds of appeal advanced by the foregoing

Defendants against the impugned judgment.

The appeal filed by the 12th Defendant (Appeal No. CA/DCF/340/99):

The 12th Defendant has been allotted 224/3840 shares in the impugned

judgment. The contention of the 12th Defendant was that she is entitled to

an undivided 352/3840 shares.

Although the 12th Defendant claims 352/3840 shares, she failed to

buttress that claim with satisfactory evidence. The written submissions

and the Petition of Appeal of the 12th Defendant do not disclose the

manner in which she is en titled to 352/3840 shares.

According to the evidence adduced, it is well established that the 12th

Defendant is entitled to 224/3840 shares by virtue of the title Deeds

marked 12V2 and 12V3 (rights of Hathankira). Thus, the appeal of the

12th Defendant is not sustainable.

The appeal filed by the 65th Defendant (Appeal No.

CA/DCF /342/99):

Admittedly, the 65th Defendant was not a co-owner to the subject matter

at the time of the institution of this case. During the pendency of the

instant partition action, after a long period of time, 34 years from the

institution of the said action, the 65th Defendant has purchased certain

rights from the 27th Defendant by Deed bearing No. 579 dated 08.12.1994.

Now, it is settled law tha t in partion actions, those who purchased rights

after the registration of the lis-pendent are not entitled to be added as

parties to a partition action.

2 Vide page 100 of the Appeal brief (Volume II).

Pg. 7 of 12

In Abeyratne vs. Rosalin3 it was observed by the Court of Appeal that,

"Though the 3rd Defendant-respondent had transferred his right, title

and interest to the 3rd, 23rd and 24th Defendants (appellants) they had

no right or status to be added as a party. They cannot be awarded

undivided rights by the judgment and the interlocutory decree.

Thus, the 65th Defendant who purchased rights after the registration of

the lis-pendent is not entitled to be added as a party to the action and

therefore he has no right to appeal against the impugned judgment.

Hence, the Petition of Appeal of the 65th Defendant is liable to be dismissed

in-limine.

Section 66 of the Partition Law spells out that, any voluntary alienation,

lease or hypothecation made, after the registration of lis pendent,

pertaining to the land sought to be portioned, shall be void. But, in the

event of the partition action is dismissed, such Deeds are deemed to be

valid.

However, under certain circumstances, apex courts permit voluntary

alienation.

In Nazeer vs. Hassim4 it was held that,

"Where, pending a partition action, some of the co-owners covenant

to convey absolutely all the shares, right, title and interest which will

accrue to them under and by virtue of the final decree in the partition

action, the other contracting party obtains an immediate interest in

the property, but the title can only accrue upon the entering of the

final decree. "

Pg. 8 of 12

In S.B.D. T. Karunaratne vs. Perera5 , it was observed that,

"Where, pending a partition action, a co-owner gifts to certain

persons the shares to which he will be declared entitled in the action,

the interests which are allotted in that action to the donor pass

automatically to the donees when the final decree is entered. It is not

necessary that the interests which the donees obtained on the Deed

of gift should be expressly conserved to them in the final decree, even

though they intervened in the action."

In T.H. Lannie Esmi Silva vs. K.D. Leela alias Lilie Francina6 it was

observed by T.B. Weerasuriya, J. (agreeing with N.K. UdaIagama, J.) that,

"It is to be noted that Section 66 of the Partition Law expressly

prohibits any voluntary alienation during the pendency of the action

of any undivided shares or interest of or in the land to which the

partition action relates and makes it voids. However, as stated

earlier, there were certain decided cases which had taken the

attitude that a voluntary alienation so long as it is not of any

undivided shares or interest of or in the land to which the action

relates is permissible. "

Moreover, it appears to this Court that the right of the 27th Defendant,

from whom the 65th Defendant is claiming title, has been made unallotted

in the judgment. Hence, there is no impediment for the 65th Defendant to

lead fresh evidence before the learned trial Judge towards the said

unallotted rights.

The appeal filed bv the 6A and lOA Defendants (Appeal No.

CA/DCF /343/991:

In terms of the proved pedigree, one Punchihamy has conveyed her rights

to the 16th Defendant by Deed marked 16V2. The contention of the 6A and

lOA Defendants was that the said Punchihamy died, leaving 8 children

Pg. 9 of 12

and their rights devolved on Babyhamy. On the demise of the said

Babyhamy, her rights devolved on 5th to lOth Defendants. It is to be noted

that the 6A and lOA Defendants totally failed to buttress their aforesaid

contention with either oral or documentary evidence.

Furthermore, the learned Counsel for the 6A and lOA Defendants, in the

written submissions, took up the position that the 5th to lOth Defendants

are entitled to certain shares by Deed bearing No. 12350, and consented

to the fact that they could not produce the said Deed in evidence. In the

circumstances, it is abundantly clear that the learned trial Judge was not

in a position to grant rights to the said Defendants on Deed No. 12350

which was not produced in evidence.

Besides, as per the proved pedigree, one Podinona obtained rights by

virtue of the Deed marked 27Vl. The learned trial Judge has made the

said right unalloted on the basis that there is no evidence adduced

pertaining to the devolution of title of the said Podinona. The contention

of the 6A and lOA Defendants was that the said Podihamy, by Deed

bearing No. 853, conveyed his rights to Babyhamy, and thereafter,

Babyhamy's rights devolved on the 5th to lOth Defendants. Since, the said

Deed No. 853 was not produced in evidence, there is no option to the

learned trial Judge but to make the rights of Podinona unallotted.

In these respects, it is the considered view of this Court that the Appeal

filed by the 6A and lOA Defendants is devoid of merits.

The appeal filed by the 14th, 59C and 63A Defendanats (Appeal No.

CA/DCF/341/99):

The learned Counsel for the 14th, 59C and 63A Defendanats submits that

one Jamuthupedige Hapuwa became entitled to an undivided 1/8 shares

on prescription, and upon his death, his rights devolved on his son,

Hawadiya who conveyed the said right to Podisingho Appuhamy by Deed

No. 13308 dated 24.03.1928. On the demise of the said Podisingho

Appuhamy, his rights devolved on his children, namely Yasohamy,

Nimalawathi and Podimanike. On the demise of the said Yasohamy that

Pg. 10 of 12

rights devolved on his nine children including the l4th Defendants. It is to

be noted that the foregoing devolution of rights put forward by these

Defendants has not been substantiated with either oral or documentary

evidence. The said title Deed bearing No. 13308 has not been produced in

evidence. It appears to this Court that there is no evidence before Court

to accept the contention of these Defendants.

The attention of this Court is drawn to the fact that certain shares have

been rightly made unallotted by the learned trial Judge on the footing that

the devolution of title of the same has not been established. However,

having produced the title Deeds, the parties to the action and even

outsiders are entitled to prove their rights towards the unallotted shares

before the original Court even after the delivery of the judgment.

In Sap in Singho vs. Luwis Singho and Others7 , it was observed that,

1) A practice has developed whereby even an intervenient is

pennitted to prove his title to an unallotted share after the

interlocutory decree is entered.

2) The right of a party to prove his title to a share left unallotted

in the final decree is recognised.

Conclusion:

For the foregoing reasons, I see no basis to interefeere with the judgement

of the learned District Judge of Avissawella dated 17.12.1998 in case No.

9669/P.

Therefore, I affirm the judgment of the learned District Judge dated

17.12.1998 and dismiss the appeals with Costs.
