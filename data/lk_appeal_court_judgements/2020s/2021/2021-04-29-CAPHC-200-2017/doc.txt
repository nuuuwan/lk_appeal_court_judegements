S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

By this appeal the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) seek to set aside the orders of the learned Additional Magistrate of Mt. Lavenia

dated 10.06.2011. and the High Court Judge of Colombo dated 10.11.2017. The appellant

is a Government servant who initially served as a Stenographer attached to the Department

of Machinery which was under the purview of the Department of Irrigation. By the

letter/agreement marked as fm7 dated 29.04.85. (at page 68 of the appeal brief) quarters

bearing No.97 B in C Grade category, situated in Ratmalana Irrigation Housing Complex,

which is the subject matter of the action has been released to the appellant by the Director

of Machinery for her occupation. While, the appellant occupying the said quarters for a

period of about 35 years, the predecessor in office of the Substituted Applicant-

Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the respondent) initiated proceedings in

terms of section 6 of the Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act, No. 7 of

1969 (as amended) (hereinafter referred to as the Act) against the appellant in the

Additional Magistrates Court of Mt. Lavenia to recover the possession of the quarters.

Even though, there are no provisions in the Act to grant permission to the occupant to show

3

cause before the Court, after giving an opportunity to the appellant to show cause, by order

dated 10.06.2011. the learned Additional Magistrate issued the writ of possession. Being

aggrieved by the said order the appellant filed a revision application in the High Court of

Colombo. The learned High Court Judge, by the order dated 10.11.2017, affirmed the order

of the learned Additional Magistrate. The appellant seeks to set aside the said orders of the

learned Additional Magistrate and the High Court Judge by this appeal. The main argument

of the appellant before the Magistrates Court has been that the respondent is not the

competent authority to make an application under and in terms of the Act to recover the

possession of the quarters. Refusing to accept that argument, the learned Additional

Magistrate issued the writ of possession. In revision, the learned High Court Judge

affirming the order of the Additional Magistrate, held that the appellant has failed to

establish the exceptional circumstances to exercise the revisionary jurisdiction of the High

Court.

The main argument of the learned Counsel for the appellant before this Court is that the

ownership of the subject Housing Complex has been vested with the Land Commissioner

Generals Department which is under the purview of Ministry of Lands and Land

Development and it has never been vested or assigned to the Department of Irrigation for

the respondent to make an application under section 6 of the Act to recover the possession

of the subject quarters before the Magistrates Court as the competent authority.

The learned Counsel for the respondent submitted that the subject Housing Complex has

been vested with the Ministry of Irrigation and the Ministry has assigned it to the Irrigation

Department (as per the document marked 1-j-1 at page 289 of the appeal brief). The

learned Counsel for the appellant contends that even though, that letter states that a decision

has been taken to assign the Housing Complex to the Irrigation Department, it has not been

vested in the Department of Irrigation.

In section 9 of the Act the words competent authority is defined as follows;

the Secretary to the Ministry changed with the subject of Public Administration or any

public officer authorized by such Secretary .

4

In the action at hand, the Land Commissioner General has consented (by letter marked as

1j3 at page 582) for action being taken by the Secretary of the Ministry of Public

Administration to evict the unlawful occupants from the quarters in the subject Housing

Complex and by virtue of document marked as 1j2 (at page 290 of the appeal brief) in

terms of Clause 9 in Chapter XIX of the Establishment Code the Secretary to the Ministry

of Public Administration has delegated his powers to the Divisional Director of Irrigation

in Colombo Division to evict the illegal occupants from the quarters in terms of the Act.

The learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that on 1j2, the Secretary to the Ministry

of Public Administration has delegated powers on the respondent only for a limited purpose

of recovering the possession of Government quarters owned by and situated within the

Divisional area of Colombo and argue that the subject matter of the action neither owned

by the Irrigation Department nor situated within the area of Colombo Division. In an action

instituted under and in terms of the Act, the duty of the Magistrate is to issue the writ of

possession and he is not supposed to consider the ownership or where the particular

quarters are situated. In addition to that, according to the preamble of the Act, the purpose

of the Act is to facilitate the provisions to recover the possession of the Government

quarters from the illegal occupants and therefore, in the instant action it is immaterial

whether the quarters in litigation belongs/owned/assigned/vested on the Irrigation

Department. The important fact to be considered is whether the Divisional Irrigation

Director of Colombo is the competent authority to institute proceedings under the Act in

the Magistrates Court against appellant. Under such circumstance, the documents marked

as j4, j5, fm22, fm23 and fm28 (respectively at pages 76, 219, 221, 270, 273 and 309)

which are primarily the correspondence between the Commissioner General of Lands and

the Director of Department of Irrigation regarding the ownership of the quarters in question

are irrelevant and does not help to establish the above stated position of the appellant. In

addition to that, there is no evidence before the Court that the quarters in question is situated

outside the geographical area of Colombo Division. The appellant heavily relies on the

letter dated 26.10.19. of the Attorney General marked as fm14 (at page 623 of the appeal

brief) which states that the Housing Complex, which the subject matter of the action is

situated is not assigned to the Ministry of Irrigation and therefore, the Department of

Irrigation has no power to issue quit notices on the occupants of that Housing Complex.

5

Nevertheless, on previous occasions subsequent to that letter, this Court has expressed the

view in the cases of Hemalatha Amarasinghe vs. B. M. S. Amarasekara Deputy Director

General of Irrigation and others (Court of Appeal Writ application No. 570/02) and S.

Abeywickrama vs. B. M. S. Amarasekara Deputy Director General of Irrigation and others

(Court of Appeal Writ application No. 449/03) that the subject Housing Complex has been

assigned to the Irrigation Department by the Ministry of Irrigation and it is under the

control of that Department. There is no material before this Court contrary to that position.

Under the above circumstances, I hold that the respondent falls within the ambit of the

competent authority in terms of the Act and has the powers to issue quit notice in terms

of section 3 of the Act on the appellant and institute action in the Magistrates Court in

terms of section 6 to recover the possession of the quarters.

As per the terms and conditions contained in the agreement/letter dated 29.04.1985.

marked as fm7 (at page 68 of the appeal brief) and the provisions of Clause 6 in Chapter

XIX of the Establishment Code, appellant is entitled to occupy the quarters assigned to her

only for the period she serves for the Irrigation Department or for a maximum period of

five years. Nevertheless, to the date of filing the action in the Magistrates Court the

appellant has been in possession of the quarters in question for more than 5 years and nearly

35 years. Admittedly, to the date of preferring the appeal appellant is serving in the

Ministry of Health. In addition to that, there is no material before the Court that the

conditions mentioned in fm7 have been changed later. Therefore, it is clear that the

appellant is overstaying in the quarters in question violating the provisions of the

Establishment Code and the terms and conditions of the agreement/letter marked as fm7.

For the reason of the said violations, appellant is in any event not entitled to the coverage

of fm7, the letter issued by the Attorney General marked as fm14 and the provisions of the

Establishment Code.

The appellant contends that she has a legitimate expectation to continue in occupation of

the subject quarters until she is provided with alternative accommodation. Based on the

document marked as fm36 (at page 329 of the appeal brief) the appellant denotes that the

Government, by a Cabinet decision dated 12.08.1998. agreed/promised to offer the quarters

6

in the Housing Complex, which the quarters in question is situated to its occupants or to

construct new quarters therein to provide housing facility to the present occupants. The

appellant further states that in the letter dated 31.05.2005. marked as fm15 (at page 229 of

the appeal brief) the Secretary to the President suggested to the Secretary to the Ministry

of Irrigation to take appropriate steps to hand over the quarters to its occupants.

The principle of legitimate expectation is derived from Europe and it safeguards fairness

and natural justice in matters pertaining to Administrative Law. In Administrative Law

by H. W. R. Wade and C. F. Forsyth (Wade &amp; Forsyth, page 450) defines the

concept of legitimate expectation in the following manner.

Where some boon or benefit has been promised by an official (or has been regularly

granted by the official in similar circumstances), that boon or benefit may be legitimately

expected by those who have placed their trust in the promises of the officials. It would be

unfair to dash those expectations without at least granting the person affected an

opportunity to show the official why his discretion should be exercised in a way that fulfil

his expectations. Hence there has developed a doctrine of the protection of legitimate

expectation

It is not enough that an expectation should exists; it must in addition be legitimate. A

crucial requirement is that the assurance must itself be clear, unequivocal and

unambiguous. The test is how on a fair reading of the promise it would have been

reasonably understood by those to whom it was made.

First of all, for an expectation to be legitimate it must be founded upon a promise or

practice of a public authority that is said to be bound fulfil the expectation. Second, clear

statutory words, of course, override any expectation howsoever founded. Third, the

notification of a relevant change of policy destroys any expectation founded upon the

earlier policy, fourth, there is no artificial restriction in the material on which a legitimate

expectation rests may be based. Fifth, the individual seeking protection of the expectation

7

must themselves deal fairly with the public authority, sixth, consideration of the expectation

may be beyond the jurisdiction of the court.

As mentioned hereinbefore, the appellant has violated the terms and conditions of the

agreement/letter fm7 which the quarters had been assigned to her. The period which she is

entitled to occupy the quarters has been ended by the year 1990. Therefore, by the time the

Cabinet decision mentioned in fm36 was taken in 1998, the appellant had been in violation

within her knowledge the conditions stated in fm7. The document marked as fm15 which

has been written by the Secretary to the President contains simply recommendations and

therefore, it does not bear clear, unequivocal and unambiguous promise to the appellant

that the quarters in question will be given to her. Under the above stated circumstances, the

appellant is not entitled to a judgment in her favour on the concept of legitimate

expectation.

The learned Counsel for the appellant submits that the affidavit tendered to the Magistrates

Court in terms of Section 6(2) of the Act is not a valid affidavit for the reason that it does

not contain a jurat and has not certified by the person who administered the affirmation.

The learned Counsel for the respondent denies that submission and submit that the affidavit

filed in the Magistrates Court is according to the Form C in the Schedule to the Act. The

affidavit is filed of record (at page 600 of the appeal brief) marked as fm3. When perusing

fm3, the Court can be satisfied that it is according to the Form C of the Schedule to the Act

and in terms of section 12 of the Oaths and affirmation Act, No. 13 of 1954.

The appellant further argues that a certain amount of money has been deducted from her

monthly wages as the rent for the quarters which she is occupying. However, the appellant

has failed to furnish material to establish that fact. On the other hand, in the absence of a

valid agreement for possession of the quarters, the appellant cannot argue that she is legally

entitled to possess the quarters for the mere reason that the money has been deducted from

her salary. Considering all the above stated facts, I hold that the impugned orders of the

learned Additional Magistrate and the High Court Judge are according to the law and the

facts of the case and necessity does not arise for this Court to interfere with the finding of

8

the learned Additional Magistrate and the High Court Judge. Therefore, I affirm the

impugned orders and dismiss the appeal. The appellant should pay Rs. 25,000/- as cost of

this appeal to the respondents.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

I agree.
