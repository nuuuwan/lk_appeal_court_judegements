Judgment

The Party of the 2nd Part of the Petitioner-Appellant [hereinafter referred to as the Appellant] had

preferred this appeal seeking to set aside the Order/Judgment dated 05.07.2016 by the learned High

Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the North-Western Province, holden at Kuliyapitiya.

The facts of this case are as follows,

The Complainant-Respondent-Respondent being the Officer in Charge of the Police Station,

Narammala had filed an information in terms of Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act

in the Magistrates Court of Kuliyapitiya, holden in Narammala, against the Party of the 1st Part-

Respondent-Respondent [hereinafter referred to as the Respondent] and the Appellant [2nd Part-

Petitioner-Appellant] on the basis of a dispute relating to a land, which arose between the aforesaid

Appellant and the Respondent.

Page 4 of 13

It appears that the Complaint was made by the Respondent alleging that the Appellant was

effecting an illegal construction adjoining to her building encroaching upon her Eaves () about

3 feet wide strip of land and has requested to stop the same. Since there was no settlement between

the parties, the matter was referred to the Magistrates Court of Kuliyapitiya for adjudication, by

the said Complainant-Respondent-Respondent [Officer in Charge of the Police Station,

Narammala].

After the filing of Affidavits, Counter Affidavits, and Written Submissions by the parties, while

pending the matter for Order, the parties opted to call for site inspection. The learned Magistrate

who was acting as a Primary Court Judge did the inspection and since there was no settlement

between the parties, the matter was fixed for Order.

The learned Primary Court Judge delivered the Order on 17.07.2013 in favour of the Respondent.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the 2nd Part-Petitioner [Appellant] invoked the Revisionary

Jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Kurunegala, later transferred to the High Court of

Kuliyapitiya.

However, the learned High Court Judge had taken up the matter for inquiry and thereafter

dismissed the Application of the 2nd Part-Petitioner [Appellant] and affirmed the Order of the

learned Primary Court Judge. Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Appellant preferred this

Appeal to set aside the Order/Judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 05.07.2016 and

seeking relief as prayed for in the prayer to the Revision Application bearing Case No.

HCR/96/2013 (REV) of the High Court of Kuliyapitiya.

The Appellant has taken up the position in the Petition of Appeal that the 1st Respondents First

Complaint to the Narammala Police on 30.10.2012 was that

, .

. .

The Petitioner [Appellant] in his statement to the Police, admitted that there is an Aguwa-,

but it is only for his use and nowhere in the Proceedings that the Respondent has said that the

Appellant has no right to use the said Aguwa [] which is in the Appellants land. Therefore,

the question before the Court was whether the Respondent has the right to use the Aguwa []

standing on in between the Petitioners [Appellant] land and the Respondents premises in terms

of Section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

It was alleged by the Appellant that the learned Primary Court Judge held in favour of the

Respondent, very strongly converting the entire action from the original form of of 3 feet

wide-strip of land (a Servitude) which comes under the purview of Section 69 of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act, which is contrary to the relief prayed for by the Respondent by her 1st

Complaint to the Police dated 30.10.2012 which is a dispute with regard to an illegal construction

covering an of 3 feet.

The main contention of the Appellant was that he has a right to erect constructions of the said

Eaves () in question, referred to in the first Complaint by the Respondent.

Furthermore, the Appellant contended that the Respondent has no right to use the said Eaves ()

as a right of way, whereas her shop premises [ ] is facing Negombo-

Kurunegala High Road, and in the instant case, the Respondent had failed to prove that she has a

Page 6 of 13

right of way over the said Eaves (), of which she has no soil rights, in terms of Section 69 of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act. Therefore, the Respondent cannot in any way claim Possession

as of a right in terms of Section 68 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act. Thus, the information

filed in terms of Section 66(1) of the said Act, clearly reported that the dispute between the

Appellant and the Respondent is a dispute regarding an Eaves () 3ft wide, which reads as

follows.

30.10.2012

,

.

As such, it was argued on behalf of the Appellant that according to the information filed in the

Primary Court of Kuliyapitiya, it is a dispute between the Appellant and the Respondent in respect

of an Eaves () 3ft wide as a Servitudanal Right and not with regard to a Question of Possession

in terms of Section 68 of the Act. Thus, the Primary Court Case bearing No. 10094/66 is falling

under the purview of Section 69 of the Act.

As such, it was submitted by the Appellant that the learned Primary Court Judge misdirected

himself by converting a Servitudanal Right into a dispute in relation to Possession and has

erroneously made an Order in terms of Section 68 of the Act instead of Section 69 of the Act,

Page 7 of 13

where the scope of the instant Action according to the information filed by the Police has been

changed by the Respondent.

As such the Appellant has contended that the Appellant has a right to build on his own land up to

the Eaves ()-3ft wide, since an Eaves per se is a projection of a roof to an adjoining land or

over hanging roof in which the Respondent does not have any soil right over the said Eaves ().

Apparently, the Counsel for Respondent urged Court that the information filed by the Police and

the Affidavits, and the relevant documents produced by the Parties before the learned Primary

Court Judge at the inquiry are in relation to possession of a strip of land which is 3 feet wide,

situated South to the land of the Party of the 1st Part-Respondent [Respondent].

The said 3 feet wide, strip of land are Eaves (), which was in their possession for a period of

over 60 years.

However, the contention of the Appellant is that the dispute between the parties is not in relation

to Possession, but with regard to a Servitudanal Right. Thus, the learned Primary Court Judge

should have made the Order in terms of Section 69 and not under Section 68 of the said Act.

It appears that the learned Primary Court Judge has drawn the attention to the affidavits and the

documents produced before him by the Parties. According to the Affidavit of the Respondent, his

predecessors and himself have been in possession of the block of land adjoining the disputed 3 feet

wide strip of land adjacent to the Respondents premises from time immemorial.

The said strip of land () has been used by the Respondent to have access to the rear portion of

his shop premises.

Page 8 of 13

It was revealed in the affidavit of the Respondent that the said strip of land was in between the

Respondent's shop premises and the building belonged to the Appellant. After the demolition of

the said building by the Appellant, the disputed strip of land was merged to the Appellant's land.

It is seen that the dispute arose between the parties when the Appellant started construction on his

land encroaching upon the disputed portion of the Eaves ()-3 feet wide strip of land.

The learned Primary Court Judge has stated in his Order regarding the site inspection of the

disputed portion of land as follows,

.

15 18

.

The learned Primary Court Judge observed that the affirmants of the said affidavits 15-18 had

affirmed that there was a 3 feet wide strip of a road in existence at the inspected site.

Furthermore, the learned Primary Court Judge observed that the plan 22 submitted by the

Appellant, clearly depicts a strip of land and also the Appellant had admitted that there were Eaves

() in between the shop premises of the Respondent and the Appellants land.

In this instance, it is worthy to note the statement made on 03.11.2012 to the Narammala Police

by the Appellant,

Page 9 of 13

102 .

.

.

According to the said statement of the Appellant, it amply proves that there were Eaves ()

adjoining to the Respondents shop premises and in between the Appellants land to access to the

rear portion of the Respondents shop premises, and the Respondent and his predecessors had been

using the same from time immemorial. Apparently, the said position was substantiated by the

Respondent by producing the documents 15-18.

Since the learned Primary Court Judge could not identify the Eaves ()-3 feet wide portion of

land at the site inspection, it was observed by the learned Primary Court Judge that the dispute

arose between the parties as a result of dispossessing the Respondent from the 3 feet wide strip of

land by the Appellant. Thus, the learned Primary Court Judge has come to the conclusion

that the Respondent has been dispossessed by the Appellant two months prior to the date of filing

of the information before the Primary Court, in terms of Section 68 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act.

Nevertheless, the Appellants contention was the dispute between the parties, to an Eaves ()-

3 feet wide is not with regard to a Question of Possession in terms of Section 68 of the Act. The

dispute between the parties falls under the purview of Section 69 of the Act since it involves a

servitudanal right of an Eaves of 3 feet wide. Hence, the Order of the learned Primary Court Judge

cannot stand against the Appellant, as it was made on the pretext of Section 68 of the Act and not

in fact in terms of Section 69 of the Act.

Page 10 of 13

It was argued on behalf of the Appellant that he has a right to build on his own land because the

Respondent does not have any soil right over the said Eaves ()-3 feet wide, Eaves per se is a

projection of a roof to an adjoining land or an overhanging roof. This principle of Law has been

accepted in the case of Saibo Vs James Appu 7 N.L.R 239, which held that the Plaintiff was bound

to remove the overhanging eaves notwithstanding that they have existed in that position for 30

years and that if the Defendant builds a house on their own land they should so finish and roof

their houses that the Plaintiff's wall would not suffer in consequence of the removal of the eaves.

The Courts attention was drawn to the Order dated 17.07.2013 of the learned Primary Court Judge

which has been decided under Section 68 of the Act, entirely based upon a Question of Possession.

.

It was submitted by the Appellant that, the above finding of the learned Magistrate of the

Magistrates Court of Kuliyapitiya acting as the Primary Court Judge is very strange and contrary

to the dispute between the Parties, as regards to a Servitudanal Right of an Eaves. According to

Law, Eaves do not involve a land, it is in fact an overhanging roof or a projection of a roof to

the adjoining land and it does not attach to a soil right.

Page 11 of 13

According to The Government Legal Glossary (at page 101), the word is described as Eaves,

. It is also submitted that the said dispute emanated upon the said Eaves (Aguwa)

according to the Police Complaint dated 30.12.2012 made by the 1st Respondent. Apparently, the

impugned Order dated 17.07.2013 in question was delivered by the learned Primary Court Judge,

that the 1st Respondent was possessing a 3ft wide strip of land and he was dispossessed from the

said portion of land by the Appellant. Thereby the learned Magistrate has considered in the wrong

footing that the said Action bearing No. 10094/66 in the Magistrates Court of Kuliyapitiya, is

coming under the purview of Section 68 of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act, but in fact, the

instant Case as originated upon a question of Eaves (Aguwa) which is a Servitudanal Right.

Therefore, the Respondent should have been first proved in terms of Section 69 of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act, before praying any claim under the said Servitude.

It is imperative to note the 1st Complaint dated 30.10.2012, made by the Respondent to the

Narammala Police, which states that,

.

. ..

.

..........................................................

It is pertinent to note the word used by the Respondent in her said Complaint was . It was

brought to the notice of the Court by the Appellant that the English word for is Eaves.

Page 12 of 13

It is to be noted that the meaning of the word Eaves is described in the Oxford Dictionary as,

The part of a roof that meets or overhangs the walls of a building.

Apparently, the word is defined in the Carters Sinhala-English Dictionary as, Portion of

ground below the Eaves. Therefore, it is clear that when the Respondent mentioned about a

in her 1st Complaint, it is not with regard to a part of a roof or underside of a projecting roof. It

clarifies that the Respondent used the word with reference to a 3 feet wide strip of land.

According to the Malalasekera English-Sinhala Dictionary, it defines the word Eaves as,

; ; thus the word eaves, has two meanings. One is, part of

roof or underside of a projecting roof and the other is the portion of ground below the Eaves.

As such, it clearly manifests that the Respondent referred to in his first complaint in respect

of a 3 feet wide strip of a land below the Eaves.

In view of the material placed before the learned Primary Court Judge, it is apparent that an

unauthorized construction was started by the Appellant by encroaching the 3 feet wide strip of land

which the Respondent was in possession before a period of 2 months immediately prior to the date

on which the information was filed under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

As such, under such circumstances the learned Primary Court Judge was justified in holding that

the Respondent was dispossessed by the Appellant from the disputed 3 feet wide strip of

land.

Page 13 of 13

Similarly, the learned High Court Judge held that the Order made by the learned Primary Court

Judge, acting in terms of Section 68 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act is well founded and

according to Law.

Thus, we see no reason to interfere with the Order/Judgment dated 05.07.2016 made by the learned

High Court Judge dismissing the Application of the Appellant and the Order made by the learned

Primary Court Judge on 17.07.2013.

Hence, we dismiss the Appeal with costs.
