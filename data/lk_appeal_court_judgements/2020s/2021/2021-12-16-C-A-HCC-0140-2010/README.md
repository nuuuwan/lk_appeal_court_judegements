Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the accused appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the appellants) on being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence of them

by the learned High Court judge of Kalmunai.

The appellants were originally indicted before the High Court of Kalmunai for

13 counts against them. The 1st count was against all the appellants on the

basis of Kidnapping a minor named M.I.I. Ahamad from the lawful guardian

and thereby committing an offence punishable in terms of section 354 of the

Penal Code.

The 2nd to 4th counts were against the 1st appellant on the basis of grave sexual

abuse of the above mentioned minor, punishable in terms of section 365b(2)b

of the Penal Code.

The 5th to 7th counts were against the 3rd appellant on the basis that he

committed the offence of grave sexual abuse on the minor Ahamad, punishable

in terms of section 365b(2)b of the Penal Code.

Page 4 of 14

The 8th to 13th counts were against the 4th appellant on the basis that he aided

and abetted the 1st and the 3rd appellants in committing the offence of grave

sexual abuse of the said minor, punishable in terms of section 365b(2)b of the

Penal Code.

Before the indictment was read over to the appellants, counts 14 to 19 have

been added to the indictment against the 2nd appellant on the basis that he too

aided and abetted the 1st and the 3rd appellants to commit grave sexual abuse

of the minor mentioned, punishable in terms of section 365b(2)b of the Penal

Code.

All the mentioned offences are said to have been committed at Akkaraipattu on

or about 12th January 2003.

The trial has been proceeded against the 3rd appellant in absentia under the

provisions of section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The learned High

Court judge by her judgment dated 27-08-2010 found the appellants guilty in

the following manner and sentenced accordingly.

All the appellants were found guilty on count 01, and were sentenced to a term

of 7 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine.

The 1st appellant was convicted for the 2nd, 3rd, and the 4th counts against him

as well, and was sentenced to a term of 10 years rigorous imprisonment on

each count and a fine.

The 3rd appellant was found guilty of the 5th, 6th, and the 7th counts against

him, and was sentenced to a term of 10 years rigorous imprisonment on each

count and a fine.

The 4th appellant was acquitted of the 8th, 9th, and the 10th, charges against

him, and was convicted on the 11th, 12th, and the 13th, charge. He was

sentenced to a term of 10 years imprisonment on each of the counts he was

convicted, in addition to a fine.

Page 5 of 14

The 2nd appellant was acquitted of the rest of the charges against him, namely,

14th to 19th counts.

The sentences imposed on the appellants were ordered to run concurrently,

while the 1st,2nd, and the 3rd appellants were also ordered to pay compensation

amounting to Rs. 100,000.00 each, to the victim.

At the hearing of the appeal, although several grounds appeals have been

urged in their respective written submissions, the following grounds were urged

and argued as the main grounds of appeal by the learned Presidents Counsel

and the other counsel for the consideration of the Court.

(1) The alleged victims evidence was not credible and reliable enough

for the Court to act on his evidence alone.

(2) The learned High Court judge was misdirected when she decided

that the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) was

corroborative of the victims evidence.

(3) The 2nd appellant was wrongly convicted for the offence of

kidnapping without any evidence against him.

Evidence in brief: -

PW-01 who was the victim of this sexual assault has commenced his evidence

on 07-10-2009. It has been his evidence that when he went to the school

playground on the day of the incident to play a game of cricket with his friends,

the 3rd and the 4th appellants who came there wanted to play cricket with them

forcibly. Thereafter, they lined the boys who were present and the 4th accused

after assaulting him with a steel bar, handed him over to the 3rd appellant. The

3rd appellant who forcibly took PW-01 to the urinal nearby sexually assaulted

him. According to the evidence of PW-01 the 3rd appellant has first put his male

organ between his thighs and has put the male organ in the mouth. Thereafter,

he has spat onto the anus of PW-01 and had anal intercourse.

Page 6 of 14

It has been the evidence of PW-01 that when he came out of the urinal after the

sexual assault, the 1st appellant who was there assaulted him using his hands

and told him to take the bicycle and run. When the 4th appellant said that he

wanted to see the size of his male organ, the 1st appellant has assaulted him

too. Upon questioning, he has stated that the 3rd and the 4th appellants

appeared to be drunk at that time, but has not stated so about the 1st

appellant. The evidence of that day clearly appears that the witness had been

repeatedly asked by the prosecuting State Counsel as to what the 1st appellant

did to him, but the witness has maintained the same stand with regard to the

1st appellant. As for the 2nd appellant, it has been his evidence that he saw him

outside after the incident and he was with the others and he too scolded him.

In a nutshell, it has been the position of PW-01 that it was only the 3rd and the

4th appellants who were involved in the offence of sexual assault on him.

However, when continuing his evidence in chief on the next day of the trial,

namely, on 17-11-2009, in complete contrast to the first days evidence as to

the 1st appellant, he has stated that after the sexual acts by the 3rd appellant,

the 1st appellant too performed the same acts as the 3rd appellant did on him

and only thereafter, he was asked to go. He has stated that when this was

happening two persons who were brothers of his friend came and asked the 1st

appellant to release him.

PW-02 was the father of PW-01, who was not an eyewitness to the incident, but

his evidence establishes the emotional and mental trauma his son had to

undergo because of what happened to him.

PW-04, M. Ameer Riyas appears to be one of the persons whom the PW01 says

that came to the scene of the incident. It was his evidence that when he came

to the school playground that day, he saw the 3rd appellant who was a student

at the same school, fighting with a small boy near the entrance of the play

ground and the 2nd appellant was sleeping drunk near the gate. He has seen

Page 7 of 14

the 1st appellant standing nearby along with several other persons. He has also

seen the small boys who were present throwing stones at the elder boys.

PW-05 was a boy who was in the same grade as the PW-01, who has come to

play on that day. His evidence was that the 3rd appellant took the victim to a

place behind the playground and did not see the incident. He has not

implicated any of the other appellants to the incident.

PW 12 was one of the Police investigators into the incident. According to him,

PW-01 in his first statement to the Police has revealed the names of two

persons who were responsible for the sexual attack on him. However, I find

that the prosecution has failed to explain the need for having an identification

parade with regard to all the appellants if two of them were known to PW-01.

The next witness of importance was the doctor who was the then District

Medical Officer (DMO) of the Akkaraipattu base hospital. He has examined the

victim four days after the incident. In the short history given to the doctor the

victim boy had informed that he was subjected to anal intercourse apart from

other sexual acts on him. The doctor has specifically stated that the victim

mentioned two or three names of persons who are responsible, but he did not

take down any notes as to the names. It has been his evidence that although

he examined the boy including his anus for injuries, he was unable to observe

any, but has not ruled out the possibility of sexual abuse of the victim. He has

expressed this opinion on the basis that injuries in an incident of this nature

can disappear within hours of it happening and also on the basis that such

acts can happen without injuries being caused.

When questioned by the Court, the doctor has stated that when the victim was

admitted to the hospital on the day of the incident, namely on the 12th, the

doctor who examined the patient initially, has also noted that were no visible

injuries to the victim.

Page 8 of 14

When called for a defence at the conclusion of the prosecution evidence,

making dock statements, the 1st, 2nd and the 4th appellants who were present

in Court have denied any involvement of a sexual assault on PW-01.

Grounds of Appeal: -

Relying heavily on the prosecutions failure to get an explanation from PW-01

for the reasons for him to implicate the 1st appellant when he gave evidence on

the second day of the trial, it was the view of the learned Counsel for the

appellants that it was a matter that cut across the case of the prosecution. It

was their contention that without a proper explanation as such, the evidence of

PW-01 cannot be considered credible and trustworthy on its own.

Furthermore, it was argued that although a trial judge can rely on even only

one solitary witness to an incident, this was not an action where it was safe to

act without corroboration.

It was contended further that it may be the very reason why the learned High

Court judge looked for corroboration for the evidence of PW-01, however, the

evidence of the doctor was not corroborative as considered by the learned trial

judge.

It was the contention of the learned DSG that although the prosecution has

failed to get an explanation as to the discrepancy of the evidence of PW-01, it

has not lowered the credibility of his evidence. It was his view that PW-01 may

not have implicated the 1st appellant through fear as he was present in Court,

but has implicated the 3rd appellant who was absconding. He pointed out that

it was the same judge who heard the evidence in its entirety had pronounced

the judgment after considering the evidence in its totality, which needs no

disturbance from the Court.

However, he conceded the weak nature of the evidence against the 2nd

appellant for him to be convicted for the offence of kidnapping.

Page 9 of 14

It was his position that the convictions against the 1st, 3rd, and the 4th

appellants should stand as they have been reached after giving due

consideration to the evidence.

As pointed out correctly, in his evidence on the first day, PW-01 has been very

specific in his evidence that it was the 3rd and the 4th appellants who were

involved in the sexual attack on him. His evidence even suggestive that the 1st

appellant was trying to send the victim away from the scene of the crime and

that he even assaulted the 4th appellant in the process.

I find that for a reason known only to him, he has changed the version of

events in order to implicate the 1st appellant on the second day of his evidence.

This leads to an obvious presumption that PW-01 may have been coached after

the first day of the trial in some form or another, unless otherwise explained by

the prosecution through evidence the reasons for his about turn on the

involvement of the 1st appellant.

In this action the Counsel for the appellants has not cross-examined PW-01 on

this discrepancy of his evidence. However, it is not a matter that can be held

against the appellants as it was the duty of the prosecution to prove the

charges levelled against an accused beyond reasonable doubt.

In the case of Pantis Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 148 it was held:

The burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove all ingredients

of the charge beyond reasonable doubt and there is no burden in our law

for the accused to give any explanation (unless in certain cases where

specific provision is made by law). In my view it is sufficient if the accused

gives an explanation which satisfies the Court or at least is sufficient to

create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.

I am not in agreement with the learned Counsel for the appellants that

whatever the truth may be, this non-explanation as to this vital piece of

evidence was a matter that goes into the root of the credibility of the evidence of

Page 10 of 14

PW-01, unless otherwise corroborated by some other independent evidence,

but in agreement when it comes to the evidence against the 1st appellant with

regard to his involvement to the crime.

It is to be noted that it was the same learned High Court judge who heard the

evidence in its entirety has pronounced the judgment.

In the case of D. Tikiribanda Vs. The Attorney-General C.A. Case No-

64/2003 decided on 06-10-2009, reported in BASL Law Reports (2010)

BLR 92,

Held:

(1) While a Court of Appeal will always attach the greatest possible weight to

any finding of fact of a judge of a court of first instance based upon oral

testimony given before that judge, it is not absolved by the existence of

these findings from the duty of forming its own view of the facts, more

particularly in a case where the facts are of such complication that there

right interpretation depends not only on any personal impression which a

judge may have formed by listening to the witness but also upon

documentary evidence, and upon inferences to be drawn from the

behaviour of these witnesses (demeanour and deportment) both before and

after the matters on which they give evidence. A Court of Appeal in such

situations is free to overrule such findings of facts if it appears that the

trial judge has misdirected himself on the facts or that wrong inferences

have been drawn from the facts.

(2) If the evidence of the victim could be relied on, is trustworthy, firm, etc.

there is no impediment on the part of the Court in acting solely on the

evidence of the victim and it is only when the evidence of the victim suffers

from some infirmity or where the Court believe that it would not be prudent

to base a conviction, solely on that evidence, the Court should look for

corroboration.

Page 11 of 14

I find that the learned High Court judge has gone on the basis that the

evidence of PW-01 was trustworthy and consistent. However, I find that it was

necessary for the learned trial judge to address her mind to the material

discrepancies of the evidence of PW-01 on the first and the second days of the

trial against the 1st appellant and come to a firm finding whether a reasonable

explanation has been provided by the prosecution in that regard, or whether

that fact can be disregarded, before deciding to accept the evidence against the

1st appellant. I am unable to find that this vital matter has drawn the attention

of the learned trial judge in the judgement, which I see as a misdirection to

that extent.

In the instant action, I find that the learned High Court judge while stating

that the evidence of PW-01 was consistent as to what happened to him on the

day of the incident has stated (at page 286 of the appeal brief) that;

At this stage even though the Court does not consider the evidence given

by the medical officer as corroborative evidence, the Court finds it as

evidence consistent with the 1st witness.

Later in the judgment (at page 288 of the appeal brief) it has been stated

that;

Therefore, medico legal examination report submitted examining the

affected boy after four days of the incident is consistent with the evidence

of the affected boy. The Court views the medical officers evidence as

corroborative to a certain extent of the small boy who was affected.

The DMO who has examined the victim boy four days after the date of the

incident has found no evidence of a sexual attack. He has expressed the

opinion that such an attack can take place without leaving any injuries. In the

instant situation the obvious part of the body where there can be telltale signs

would be the anal area of the victim, since it was his evidence that both the 1st

and the 3rd appellants had anal intercourse with him. Although the DMO has

Page 12 of 14

stated that he examined the whole body of the victim including the areas

mentioned in the short history given to him, he has not been specific as to his

examination other than making a general statement as such.

The victim was a 13-year-old boy at the time of the incident and when the

doctor who examined the victim says that there were no injuries to the victim,

his evidence cannot be considered corroboration of the evidence of the victim.

Hence, I am in no position to disagree with the contention that the evidence of

the DMO was not corroborative of the evidence of the victim.

This Court finds that the learned trial judge who had the benefit of listening to

the entirety of the evidence had at no stage of the judgment had concluded that

the evidence of the victim of any of the other witnesses for that matter was not

cogent enough. She has not looked for corroboration on such a basis. The

learned trial judge who had the benefit of observing the demeanor and the

deportment of PW-01 has considered him as credible and trustworthy witness

with good reasoning.

Under the circumstances, I find that that the learned trial judge has looked at

the evidence of the DMO only as an additional piece of evidence which is

consistent with the version of the victim and not because she was looking for

corroboration on the basis that the evidence of the victim was not cogent

enough to act on that evidence alone.

Although the evidence of the DMO cannot be considered corroboration of the

evidence of the victim per say, I find that the evidence given by PW-05 who was

a boy playing with the PW-01 at the playground on the day of the incident as

relevant and corroborative of the evidence of PW-01. According to him the 3rd

appellant has taken PW-01 to a place behind the playground and has not

returned for some time. This has prompted him to go and alert the parents of

the victim. Although he has not seen the sexual acts by the 3rd appellant, this

evidence, in my view, is corroborative of the evidence of PW-01 as to what

happened to him thereafter. I find that this a matter that has escaped the

Page 13 of 14

attention of the learned High Court judge in analyzing evidence of the

prosecution.

If one takes the evidence of PW-01 and the other witnesses who testified in this

trial as a whole, the victims failure to implicate the 1st appellant when he gave

evidence on the first day of the trial cannot be construed as that he was lying

as to what happened to him, but as coming out with additional evidence on the

second day of the trial.

However, in the absence of any acceptable explanation from the witness in this

regard, this is a matter that has to be considered in favour of the 1st appellant

only, and not in favour of the others, as the evidence of PW-01 was otherwise

trustworthy and consistent with regard to what happened to him on that day.

I am unable to agree with the contention of the learned DSG that the victim

boy may not have come out with the full incident and he may have implicated

the 3rd appellant who was not present in Court, because of his fear of the 1st

appellant. I find no basis for this argument. If that was so it would have been

the evidence in the form of an explanation and not in the form of an argument

to justify the failure of the prosecution by the learned DSG.

This Court is also very much mindful that looking for corroboration of a sexual

attack of this nature is not warranted as a rule.

In the case of Bhoginbhai Harigibhai Vs. The State of Gujarat 1983 AIR SC

753 it was stated that In the Indian setting, refusal to act on the testimony of a

victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration is adding insult to

injury., which is very much so in the Sri Lankan setting as well.

For the reasons considered as above, I am of the view that it was not safe to

convict the 1st appellant for the charges preferred against him. Therefore, I set

aside the conviction and the sentence passed on the 1st appellant and acquit

him of all the relevant charges.

Page 14 of 14

I find that there was no evidence against the 2nd appellant for him to be

convicted for the charge of kidnapping as has been seen at the place of the

incident only after the alleged act and the conviction against the 2nd appellant

cannot be allowed to stand. Hence, I set aside the conviction and the sentence

of him. The 2nd appellant is acquitted of the kidnapping charge for which he

was convicted.

As discussed before, I find that the evidence presented before the Court against

the 3rd appellant as to the grave sexual abuse of PW-01, and as to the aiding

and abetting of the 4th appellant for the 3rd appellant to commit the act, has

been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The appeals by the 3rd and the 4th

appellants are hereby dismissed as they are devoid of merit.

The appeals of the 1st and the 2nd accused appellants allowed.

The appeals of the 3rd and the 4th accused appellants dismissed.
