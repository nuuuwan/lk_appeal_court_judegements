Argued on: 17th February 2021 and 3rd March 2021 Decided on: 3rd June 2021 Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA This matter was taken up for argument together with CA (Writ) Application No.

53/2017. The learned Counsel agreed that the facts and circumstances of this

application are identical to those in CA (Writ) Application No. 53/2017, and that the

parties to this application are agreeable to be bound by the judgment that would be

delivered in CA (Writ) Application No. 53/2017.

By a judgment delivered today in CA (Writ) Application No. 53/2017, I have issued a

Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the Respondents from relying on the field sheet

referred to in the said Judgment for the purpose of determining the boundaries of

the lake adjoining the Petitioners land.

I have also held that the 9th Respondent may proceed to demarcate all other lands

coming under the Divisional Secretary area of Kesbewa and falling within the Bolgoda

Environmental Protection Area in accordance with the boundary of the Bolgoda Lake

as it prevailed in 2016, as evidenced by the line demarcated in orange in the

document marked 6R11 filed by the 6th Respondent in that application.

I accordingly issue a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the Respondents from relying on

the field sheet referred to in the said Judgment for the purpose of determining the

boundaries of the lake adjoining the Petitioners land. I make no order with regard to

costs.
