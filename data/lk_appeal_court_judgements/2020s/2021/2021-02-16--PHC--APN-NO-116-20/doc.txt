MENAKA WIJESUDERA J.

The instant application was supported before us to revise the order of the

Learned High Court Judge of Chilaw on the refusal to allow the defense to

send the document marked P1 by the prosecution for examination by the

Examiner of Questioned Documents.

The position of the petitioner is that the prosecution has charged the

petitioner under section 389 of the Penal Code and the prosecution has

marked a document marked as P1 which is supposed to have been drafted

by the petitioner. The position of the prosecution is that the said

document contains 13 paragraphs whereas the position of the defense is

that the document the petitioner prepared contains only 11 paragraphs

and the 12th and the 13th paragraphs have been introduced by the

complainant to implicate the petitioner.

As such the petitioner has made an application to send the alleged

document to the Examiner of Questioned Documents in order to ascertain

the truth. But the Learned High Court Judge has refused on the basis that

the application should have been made at the time the complainant was

being cross examined. The petitioner concedes that there was a delay on

the part of the petitioner; nevertheless the instant application is made in

the interest of justice.

Upon considering the submissions made by both parties this court decides

to issue notices on the respondents.
