This is an appeal by the accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

accused) being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence of him by the learned

High Court judge of Colombo, where he was sentenced for four years rigorous

imprisonment. He was also ordered to pay a fine and compensation.

The accused was indicted before the High Court of Colombo for dishonestly

deceiving and inducing one Mohomed Riyas to deliver 400 computer parts

valued at 3,840,000/-to him by cheating, an offence punishable under section

403 of the Penal Code.

After trial, he was found guilty as charged and sentenced as above by the

learned High Court judge.

Page 3 of 9

Although the learned Presidents Counsel for the accused has not raised

specific grounds of appeal in his written submissions, he informed the Court

that he is relying on the following grounds of appeal at the hearing of the

appeal.

(1) The document marked P-01 has been admitted as evidence in

contravention of the principles of evidence.

(2) Whether the learned High Court judge has failed to appreciate vital

contradictions between the evidence of PW-01, PW-02 and PW-11 who

was the investigating officer.

(3) The prosecution has failed to prove the estimated loss caused to the

complainant as stated in the indictment.

The facts relating to the action briefly, are as follows:

PW-02 was the owner of the business called Tech Information Solutions Pte.

Ltd situated at the Unity Plaza Building in Bambalapitiya, whose principal

business was to sell and supply computers and parts in bulk or retail. It was

his evidence that on the day of the incident, namely 23-11-2009, when he

came to his shop to check on the days business, he came to know that money

has not been received for a cash sale done by one of his sales assistants

namely, Mohamed Riyas (PW-01) for an amount of 3,840,000/- rupees as

stated in the sales invoice marked P-01 for the supply of 400 Computer Central

Processing Units (CPU).

According to the evidence of the sales assistant of the establishment (PW-01),

the accused was a person introduced by a similar business establishment, who

gained their confidence by making a prompt cash payment for a previous

supply of 200 units of CPU. As a result, when the accused ordered 400 units

on the day of the incident on a cash payment basis, he and his manager had

no reason to suspect the accuseds bona fides. Agreeing to pay upon delivery,

the accused has requested that the goods be delivered to a place near the

Liberty Plaza Building in Kollupitiya and it was the driver of the establishment

Page 4 of 9

Thuwan Rafaideeen (PW-03) who delivered the goods. The accused has taken

delivery of 35 CPUs at a place near Liberty Plaza building and has asked the

driver to deliver the balance to a place near Kolonnawa, promising to pay for

the goods upon full delivery. After receiving the goods and the cash payment

receipt from PW-03, the accused has asked the driver to wait for five minutes

until he brings the money. However, since the accused failed to return as

agreed, the driver has informed PW-01, the person who tasked him to deliver

the goods to the accused. The driver, and PW-01 who arrived at the place of

delivery subsequently, has been made to wait until 11.30 in the night by the

accused with the promise to pay and had later informed them that he will

make the payment on the following day.

Since the accused had failed to pay even on the following day, it was the PW-

02, the owner of the establishment who has made the relevant complaint to the

Police. It is also evidence that the accused has handed back the invoice marked

P-01 which was in his possession at the Police station. He has also given the

letter marked P-02, undertaking to pay the sum due.

It appears that the accused has taken several contradictory stands during the

cross examination of the witnesses for the prosecution as well as in his dock

statement when called for a defence.

It has been suggested to the owner of the establishment, namely PW-02 that

the accused never received the goods mentioned in the sales invoice P-01.

However, in cross examining PW-01 who in fact sold the goods to the accused,

the position of the accused had been that he has to pay only a small amount

more for the goods delivered, which gives the inference that he in fact received

the goods as mentioned. Making a dock statement, it has been his stand that

he paid cash for all the goods mentioned in the charge against him and the

receipt issued to him was taken over by the complainant at the Police station.

Page 5 of 9

Although the learned Presidents Counsel for the accused formulated three

grounds of appeal for consideration, I would now proceed to consider them

together since all the grounds urged are interwoven.

It was the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel that the prosecution

has failed to call the storekeeper of the business establishment to prove that in

fact the goods mentioned in the cash voucher P-01 were delivered to the

defendant and also evidence from the accounts division of the company to

establish that the amount claimed was not settled. It was his view that the

prosecution has failed to establish the main ingredients of the charge by failing

to prove the value of the goods claimed to be cheated by the accused.

It was also his contention that vital contradictions revealed in evidence as to

the document marked P-01 has escaped the attention of the learned trial judge.

It was his position, that according to the evidence of PW-03, the receipt for the

goods delivered to the accused has been handed over to the accused at the

point of delivery. However, the investigating officer PW-11s evidence had been

that the receipt P-01 was handed over to him by the complainant PW-02, which

in his view was a major contradiction and it was not safe to convict a person on

such unsafe evidence.

It was the contention of the learned SSC for the Attorney General that it is the

totality of the evidence that has to be considered in a trial of this nature and

the document marked P-01 was an admitted document in several ways. It was

her view that admitted facts need no further proof in accordance with the

provisions of the Evidence Ordinance and the Criminal Procedure Code and the

prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, hence no basis for

the appeal.

It is well settled law that it is the totality of the evidence that has to be

considered in a trial and not pieces of evidence in its isolation. I am of the view

that the totality of the evidence means the evidence of the prosecution as well

Page 6 of 9

as the evidence for the defence, which includes any dock statement made by an

accused.

It was held in the case of James Silva Vs. Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2

SLR 167 that;

A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider

all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by

the defence in its totality without compartmentalizing and, ask himself

whether as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he

believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty."

The offence of Cheating as defined by section 398 of the Penal Code reads as

follows;

Section 398

Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly

induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any

person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or

intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do

anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived,

and which act or omission causes or is likely to causes damage or

harm to that person in body, mind, reputation, or property, or

damage or loss to the Government is said to " cheat".

Explanation- A dishonest concealment of facts is a deception

within the meaning of this section.

The section 403 of the Code under which the accused was charged described

the punishment for Cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property.

Page 7 of 9

In the case of Perera Vs. The Attorney General (1985) 2 SLR 156 it was held:

It is the inducement and not the delivery that constitutes the gist of the

crime. The words induces the person so deceived to deliver to any

property to any person in the penal section are wide enough to include not

only property in the ownership or possession of the person so induced but

also any property under the control of the person so induced.

When it comes to the evidence of the matter under appeal, I am unable to find

any basis for the contention that the prosecution has failed to establish the

value of the goods and that the goods were actually delivered to the accused.

Although it was the position of the accused that the goods were not delivered to

him when PW-02 who was the owner of the company gave evidence, it has been

the position of the accused that he made a part payment for the goods received

when PW-01 gave evidence. In his dock statement he has specifically stated

that he paid for the goods mentioned in the charge and he received a cash

receipt because of that. The own admissions of the accused establishes that

the accused obtained goods as mentioned in the charge to its value. Hence,

these facts are undisputed and admitted facts, which needs no further proof.

E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy in his book The Law of Evidence Vol-01 at page

135, considering the relevancy of Section 58 of the Evidence Ordinance where

it stipulates that the facts admitted need not be further proved and the

provisions of section 420(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which has similar

provisions in relation to criminal trials, states as follows:

It shall not be necessary in any summary prosecution or trial on

indictment for either party

a) To lead proof of any fact which is admitted by the opposite

party, or

b) To prove any documents the authenticity and the terms of

which are not in dispute, and

Page 8 of 9

c) Copies of any documents may be agreement of the parties be

accepted as equivalent to the originals.

Such admissions may be made before or during the trial and shall be

sufficient proof of the fact or facts admitted without other evidence.

But the section is subject to two provisos:

i. The section shall not apply unless the accused person was

represented by an attorney-at-law at the time the admission

was made;

ii. Where such admissions have been made before the trial, they

shall be in writing, signed by the accused and attested as to

their accuracy and the identity and signature of the accused

by an attorney-at-law.

The above provisos have no application for the instant appeal as the accused

was represented by counsel throughout and the considered admissions were

admissions made during the trial.

I am unable to agree with the learned Presidents Counsel on his argument that

there are vital contradictions as to in whose custody the document marked P-

01 (the receipt) was when it was taken over by the investigating officer either. If

one reads the evidence as a whole, it becomes clear as to how the receipt given

for the goods delivered to the accused by PW-03, happens to be with PW-02

when it was handed over to the Police.

In his dock statement the accused states that the receipt issued to him (P-01)

for the goods purchased was taken back by them and thereafter they went to

the Police station and lodged a complaint against him. He has referred as

them meaning the witnesses who testified as to what happened on that day.

This sufficiently explains the reason as to why the receipt was handed over to

the Police by PW-02 who was the owner of the establishment which sold the

goods to the accused. It has been proved that the accused deceived PW-01 to

Page 9 of 9

believe that he is going to pay for the goods upon the delivery by establishing a

trust of himself in the minds of the sellers by previously buying similar articles

and making prompt cash payment for the same. It is clear from the evidence

led in this action that the accused had induced the sales person PW-01 and

his manager to deliver the property mentioned in the charge to the accused.

The evidence also has established that after taking charge of the goods, the

accused dishonestly and fraudulently failed to pay for the 400 CPUs he

obtained.

I do not find any basis for his claim that he paid cash for the goods and that

was the reason why he was given a cash receipt. The evidence clearly

establishes that because of the belief that the accused is going to pay for the

goods upon delivery, a cash payment receipt has been prepared and given to

the driver who delivered the goods as for the normal practices of the trade. It

has been taken over by the accused, with the clear intention of not paying for

the goods.

I find that the prosecution has proven all the necessary ingredients of the

offence of Cheating beyond reasonable doubt.

For the reasons stated above, I find no basis to disturb the conviction and the

sentence of the accused by the learned trial judge.

The appeal therefore is dismissed as it is devoid of merit.
