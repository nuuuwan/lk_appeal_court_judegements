JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam J

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) were indicted jointly in the High Court of Kalutara under Section

296 of the Penal Code for committing the murder of Jayasuriya

Madugodaralalage Saman Gunaratna on or about 30th May 2004.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Kalutara as the

Appellants had opted for a non-jury trial. After the conclusion of the

prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge had called for the defence

and the Appellants had given evidence from the witness box. After

considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High Court

Judge had convicted the Appellants under section 297 of Penal code and

sentenced them for 30 months rigorous imprisonment with a fine of

Rs.10000/= each on 02/07/2020.In default 06 months simple

imprisonment imposed.

3 | P a g e

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants have given consent to argue this matter in their absence due to

the Covid 19 pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellants were

connected via Zoom from prison.

The Appellants jointly contend that the Learned High Court Judge has erred

in his judgement that the 2nd Appellant exceeded the limits of the power

vested in him as a police officer in the incident which led to the death of the

deceased.

Further they contend that when considering the circumstances of this case,

which concerns an act committed in the course their duties by the

Appellants, the Learned High Court Judge ought not to have come to a

finding of guilt against either of the Appellants.

Background of the Case

On the 15th of May 2004 around 9.30 p.m., PW01 Anagipura Gnanaratna

who is the Grama Sevaka of the area having heard a sound similar to

crackers had travelled half a Km towards the area where the sound came

from. He had reached the place of incident in ten minutes and observed a

Canter lorry which had fallen in to a ditch and had seen blood splatters near

the driving seat. He had seen a motor bike bearing No.141-9152 was parked

behind the lorry. He had not witnessed the incident but made a formal

complaint to the police. He admitted that he knew of a person called Odiris

Mudalali residing in his village who grows Teak trees on his land.

PW02 Rapial Fernando hearing a report of a gun at about 9.pm had come

out from his house and had seen a Canter lorry which had tilted on its side

about 50 meters away from his house. As a person under the lorry was seen

to be injured seriously, with help of others he had been extracted from under

the lorry and sent to the hospital. He had seen the Appellants at the scene

4 | P a g e

and a gun was in the possession of the 1st Appellant. He too had not

witnessed the shooting.

On the day of the incident at about 8.30pm when PW03 Kamal Gamini was

going to his mothers place he was stopped by two police officers at

Indigasthuduwa junction. One officer was in police uniform while the other

was in civil with a gun. Then both officers had gone towards the place of

incident. After about 15 minutes he had heard gunshots. When he proceeded

towards that direction had seen a lorry toppled in front of PW02s house. He

had seen the deceased under the vehicle and helped others take the deceased

out and send him to the hospital.

PW11 was the OIC Crimes of Welipenna Police Station. On the day of the

incident, he was on mobile duty and he had gone to the place of incident

after being informed about the incident by PW 14 the reserve duty officer of

Welipenna Police Station. At the scene of incident, he had seen the

Appellants and he recovered the gun from the 1st Appellants possession.

According to him there was evidence of illicit transport of timber and had

taken 6 logs of Teak and 1 Jack log into his custody.

All above named witnesses confirmed that the road which led to the place of

incident had been properly illuminated at the time of the incident.

The JMO who conducted the post mortem had noted one gunshot entry

wound in the back of the head of the deceased which had damaged the brain

and caused the death. Smell of alcohol had been noted in the stomach

contents of the deceased.

5 | P a g e

In this Appeal it is appropriate to consider both appeal grounds together.

Firstly, the Appellants jointly contend that the Learned High Court Judge

has erred in his judgement that the 2nd Appellant exceeded the limits of the

power vested in him as a police officer which led to the death of the deceased.

Secondly, they contend that in the circumstances of this case, since this was

an act committed in the course of carrying out their duties by the Appellants,

the Learned High Court Judge ought not to have come to a finding of guilt

against either of the Appellants.

On the day of the incident 1st Appellant was in charge of the Welipenna Police

Station as most of the police officers were attending a farewell party held at

the residence of the outgoing officer in charge. At about 8.45pm they had

received information regarding illicit timber transportation at one Odiris

Mudalalis house. As five such calls were repeatedly received by the police

the 1st Appellant who was in uniform called the 2nd Appellant to accompany

him on the inquiry. The 2nd Appellant had gone for the raid in civil,

possessing a gun. After making relevant entries, the duo had gone to

Indigasthuduwa as per the information. The road leading to Indigasthuduwa

is a tarred road. When they were proceeding on the said road, they had seen

a Canter lorry coming in the opposite direction with a load of timber. The

Appellants immediately got off from the motor bike and using their hands

and by flashing the torch had signalled the driver to stop the lorry. Defying

their order, the lorry had sped up in the direction of the Appellants

threatening their lives. The 1st Appellant who is the senior officer had told

the 2nd Appellant to stop the lorry by any means. Hence the 2nd Appellant

had opened fire aiming at the tyres of the moving vehicle. As the first shot

missed the tyres and hit the ground, he had slightly raised the weapon and

fired few more shots. At this instance the lorry went out of control and

toppled in to a ditch nearby.

6 | P a g e

This situation has to be considered very carefully. After the information was

relayed, the Appellant went to place and tried to stop the lorry which carried

the timber.PW 11 in his evidence very clearly stated that there was evidence

of illicit transportation of timber. Several logs had been taken into his

custody.

According to investigating officer PW10, the road where the shooting had

occurred is not a level road. The said incident had happened on a slope.

According to PW10, it is very difficult to take aim when a vehicle is speeding

on a slope.

According to Section 56 of the Police Ordinance 16 of 1865 it states that:

Every police officer shall for all purpose in this Ordinance contained be

considered to be always on duty, and shall have the powers of a police

officer in every part of Sri Lanka, it shall be his duty;

a) To use his best endeavours and ability to prevent all crimes, offences

and public nuisances;

b) To preserve the peace;

c) To apprehend disorderly and suspicious characters;

d) To detect and bring offenders to justice;

e) To collect and communicate intelligence affecting the public peace;

and

f) promptly to obey and execute all orders and warrants lawfully issued

and directed to him by any competent authority.

When a police officer receives information regarding an offence, he is often

required to make quick decisions in maintaining the law and order. Further

he is only be protected if he discharges his duties in good faith that is with

due care and protection.

Wing-Cheong Chan|Michael Hor||Neil Morgan| Jeeva Niriella|Stantly

Yeo in their book titled Criminal Law in Sri Lanka at page 255 state that:

Some public servants such as the police and military personnel have an

important role to play in maintaining law and order or pursuing justice

in a civil society. The law imposes certain duties on these public servants

which, along with the powers which go with them, are not normally

accorded to ordinary civilians. There will invariably be occasions when,

in the discharge of these duties, the public servant causes harm which

constitute an offence. There will also be circumstances when public

servants meet physical resistance when performing their duties, and the

Penal Code gives them a number of protections. Generally speaking, the

special protections afforded to public servants are the result of the Law

and Order objectives of 19th century British interests in India and

outlying colonies.

In this case the Appellants after receiving information had promptly gone to

the place of incident and tried to prevent a crime in good faith. As the 1st

Appellant told the 2nd Appellant that culprits should somehow be

apprehended the 2nd Appellant with best of his ability tried to stop the lorry

but unfortunately a bullet struck the deceased. It is pertinent to note that

when the Appellants signalled to the driver stop the lorry, he had driven the

lorry towards the Appellants placing their lives at high risk and risking their

lives the lorry proceeded non-stop. Further the road is in a declining angle

and according to the investigating officer it is very difficult to take aim at that

place. According to the JMO the stomach contents of the deceased smelt of

alcohol.

Considering the appeal grounds advanced by the Appellant it is quite

appropriate that this matter should have been considered under section 69

of the Penal Code. They should have been awarded the benefit under the said

Section. The Learned High Court Judge ought not have come to a finding of

guilt against either of the Appellants.

8 | P a g e

Considering all the circumstances stressed before this court I conclude that

this is an appropriate case to consider for the Appellants benefit, their

entitlement under Section 69 of Penal Code;

Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by

reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of mistake of law in good

faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do it.

Due to aforesaid reasons, we set aside the conviction and sentence imposed

by Learned High Court Judge of Kalutara dated 02/07/2020 on the

Appellants. Therefore, they are acquitted from the charge.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court

of Kalutara along with the original case record.
