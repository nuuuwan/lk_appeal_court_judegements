Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

1. The 1st accused appellant and the 3rd to 10th accused appellants (hereinafter

sometimes collectively referred to as the appellants) filed these appeals

challenging the conviction and sentence of them by the learned High Court

judge of Chilaw of the judgment dated 08-02-2019.

2. The accused persons including the appellants and the now deceased 2nd

accused of the indictment were indicted before the High Court of Chilaw for

one count of being members of an unlawful assembly on 24th June 2001,

punishable under section 140 of the Penal Code, one count of causing the

death of one Lional Ferando whilst being members of the said unlawful

assembly, punishable under section 296 read with section 146 of the Penal

Code, and another count of causing the death of the above-mentioned Lional

Fernando, punishable under section 296 read with section 32 of the Penal

Code.

3. The 2nd accused mentioned in the indictment died during the pendency of the

action, and after a trial held without a jury, the appellants were found guilty

as charged and sentenced to death accordingly.

4. At the hearing of the appeals, this Court had the benefit of listening to the

erudite arguments of the learned President Counsel and the other Counsel

on behalf of the appellants as well as the learned Senior State Counsel for the

Attorney General.

5. As most of the grounds of appeal pursued by the learned Counsel are similar

in nature, this Court would consider the main grounds of appeal

cumulatively. Any individual grounds of appeal will be considered if and when

necessary for the purposes of this appeal.

Grounds of Appeal: -

6. The main grounds of appeal urged by the learned counsel can be crystallized

in the following manner.

Page 5 of 22

(1) The learned High Court judge failed to follow the essential requisites

of a judgment as envisaged in section 283 of the Penal Code by

failing to analyze the evidence led by the prosecution in its correct

perspective.

(2) The learned High Court judge was totally misdirected as to the

relevant law when she concluded that it was the burden of the

appellants who pleaded the defence of alibi to prove the same,

thereby shifting the burden of proof.

(3) The proper procedure was not followed at the trial before allowing

the leading of evidence as to the alleged recovery of a weapon used

in the crime under section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance.

(4) The learned High Court judge failed to consider the prosecution

evidence to decide whether it has established a prima facie strong

case against the appellants before considering the evidence of the

appellants led in their defence.

(5) The evidence given by some of the appellants and the dock

statements of others has been considered against each other to

disbelieve the evidence of the appellants, and the witnesses testified

on behalf of them.

(6) The learned High Court judge has decided the case on the basis of

the defence evidence rather than the evidence led by the prosecution

to prove its case, and thereby misdirected herself as to the burden

of proof in a criminal action.

(7) The learned High Court judge has failed to consider and analyze the

evidence on the offence of unlawful assembly in the judgment,

although the appellants were convicted based on being members of

such an assembly.

Page 6 of 22

(8) Evidence of bad character has been considered in the judgment as

relevant, in contrary to the established principles of law.

(9) The prosecution failed to lead relevant evidence to satisfy the Court

that PW-01 and PW-02 were not available to give evidence in Court

before leading their depositions under section 33 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

(10) The learned High Court judge has failed to address her mind to the

inherent infirmities of depositions of PW-01 and PW-02 before

considering them as evidence at the trial.

7. In this action, there had been three main eyewitnesses to the actual incident

where the deceased suffered serious cut injuries, namely PW-01 Ravindra

Fernando, PW-02 Myurin Kalista and PW-03 Lasantha Fernando. It was only

Lasantha Fernando, who has given evidence in person at the High Court trial.

On the basis that PW-01 and PW-02 cannot be found as they have left the

country, the depositions made by them in the Magistrate Court Non-

Summary Inquiry had been led in evidence under the provisions of section 33

of the Evidence Ordinance.

Evidence in brief: -

8. PW-03 Lasantha Fernando is the brother of the deceased Lional Fernando,

and was living with him at No 25, Sinhagiri Mawatha, Mudukatuwa,

Marawila. It was his evidence that on the day of the incident, namely 24-06-

2001, when he came out of the house at about 3.30 p.m. to look for his

brother who went out with Ravindra (PW-01) to look for his other brother, he

saw him being chased by a crowd of about 10-12 persons. He has initially

identified the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and the 10th appellants as the persons who

came after his brother and has stated that they carried swords, guns and

knives without specifying who carried which weapon. He has only identified

the 1st accused as Ajith and the 3rd accused as Jeyaraj at the trial. The learned

State Counsel who led the evidence has then questioned the witness

Page 7 of 22

specifically pointing to 4th , 6th and the 8th appellants whom the witness did

not implicate in his evidence initially, as to what they were carrying when the

attack took place. According to him, the deceased, who came running into the

compound of his house ran towards the back of the compound where he was

chased and attacked with swords. He has named Ajith, Chaminda, Patrik and

another person who is not in Court as the assailants of his brother, but has

not identified any of the accused who were in the dock as the persons named

by him. He has also named a person called Jerrad, as the person who was

holding a bomb and a pistol at that time. It was his evidence that before the

attack on the deceased, the persons who came into the compound attacked

the windows of the house. After the incident, the witness has taken steps to

admit the injured to the hospital where he was pronounced dead within few

minutes of admission. As to the reason for this attack it was his explanation

that he is unable to think of a reason.

9. However, it has to be noted that under cross examination, the witness has

identified the 1st, the then deceased 2nd, 3rd and the 4th accused in the High

Court as the persons who came into the compound and 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th,

and the 10th accused as the persons who stayed outside the gate and pelted

stones towards the house.

10. In his deposition before the Magistrate at the Non-Summary Inquiry, PW-01

named in the indictment, namely, Ravindra Fernando has stated that all the

eleven accused present were known to him.

11. At the inquiry, there had been 11 accused persons named and the 6th

accused named in the charge sheet filed before the Magistrate, namely, Juse

Maria Fernando had been discharged by the Magistrate. Therefore, any

references made to the 7th, 8th,9th,10th and the 11th accused in the depositions

by PW-01 and PW-02 need to be understood as references made about the

6th,7th,8th,9th and the 10th accused of the indictment before the High Court.

12. Ravindra Fernando was a person who lived in the house of the deceased.

According to him, at about 3.45 in the evening, the deceased went out of the

house to look for his brother Thushara as he was getting late, and he too went

Page 8 of 22

along with him. Before they could reach the end of Sinhagiri Mawatha, they

saw a crowd of about 10-15 persons shouting and threatening to kill Lional,

and confronted once they saw them. PW-01 has identified the persons who

were there by mentioning their names in the deposition. He and the deceased

has then hurried back to the house in order to escape from the crowd who

confronted them. He has described the actions of the accused and the

weapons they were carrying and saying at that time. When the neighbour,

Sudu Akka attempted to close the gate, she was also assaulted. PW-01 has

identified the 1st, 2nd,3rd,4th, and the 9th accused as the persons who came

into the compound and attacked the deceased and has identified the 5th to

8th and the 10th accused in the High Court by name as the persons who were

among the others outside the gate and shouting. He has described in detail

the part played by each of the accused who came into the compound in

attacking the deceased and where PW-03 was at the time of the attack.

13. In her deposition at the Non-Summary Inquiry, PW-02 who was identified as

Sudu Akka by PW-01 has described what happened. She has stated that

when Lional entered the compound through the gate, it was she who

attempted to close the gate. She has identified the 1st,3rd and the 4th accused

before the Magistrate as the persons who were among the five or six persons

who came into the compound and chased after the deceased towards the back

of the house. She has seen the 1st and the 3rd accused carrying swords and

some other persons also outside of the gate.

14. Both the witnesses have been cross examined on behalf of the accused by

the counsel who represented them at the Non-Summary Inquiry.

15. Apart from the eye witnesses, several other witnesses, the investigating Police

officers and the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who conducted the post

mortem on the deceased have given evidence at the trial.

16. The JMO has observed 12 injuries in all on the body of the deceased, out of

which injuries 1,2,4,7 were cut injuries. He has described the injury number

1,2,4,5, and 8 as defensive injuries, meaning that they are injuries suffered

while attempting to shield himself from the attack. He has described the

Page 9 of 22

injury number 07 as an essentially fatal cut injury caused to part of the head

and the neck. PW-04 and PW-05 are persons who came to the scene after the

incident. PW-09 Police officer Obris was the officer who came to the place of

the incident after receiving the first information and commenced the

investigations into the incident. He has recorded the statements of witnesses

Darmasena Fernando and Myurin Kalista and also has recorded his

observations.

17. PW-12 was the Police officer who gave evidence and marked as Y, the extract

of the statement given to then Officer in Charge (OIC) of Dankotuwa Police

(PW-08) by the 1st appellant which led to the discovery the sword marked P-

03, allegedly used in the crime. This extract has been marked under the

provisions of section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance. The witness has testified

that the then OIC of the Dankotuwa Police, Chief Inspector Roshan Perera is

now domiciled in Canada. He has also testified as to the arrest of the 1st

appellant by PW-08.

18. After PW-12 was cross examined and concluded by the defence, the State

Counsel who led the evidence, apparently after realizing the failure to take

the necessary steps he should have taken before evidence of this nature being

led, has sought the permission of the Court to act under section 159(2) of the

Evidence Ordinance, which has been granted. This is the provision where a

witness can refresh his memory while being examined in giving evidence.

Thereafter, in the pretext of re-examination of the witness, evidence has been

led to the effect that PW-08, the then OIC is not in the country. His

investigation notes have been used to lead evidence again as to the alleged

discovery of the sword based on the statement made by the 1st appellant.

There is nothing in the case record to indicate that the defence was allowed

to cross examine the witness on the new evidence led, or an application was

made in that regard by the defence.

19. It has to be noted that I am in no position to agree with the procedure adopted

by the prosecution in this regard as this was not the proper procedure to

adopt in such a scenario.

Page 10 of 22

20. At the conclusion of the prosecution evidence, the learned trial judge has

decided to call for a defence on the basis that sufficient evidence have been

adduced by the prosecution against the appellants.

21. In their defence, the 1st, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, and the 10th appellants have made

dock statements, while 3rd, 4th, and the 8th appellants have given evidence

under oath. Out of the two witnesses testified on behalf of the appellants,

Witness Juse Maria Fernando appears to have given evidence on behalf of all

the appellants and witness Leelawathi has given evidence on behalf of the 1st

appellant in support of his defence of alibi.

22. The common feature in the defence of the appellants is that all of them

denying that they were at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed.

They have taken up the position that they were at various other places at that

time and was unaware how the deceased received the fatal injuries. In other

words, they have taken up the defence of alibi.

23. Defence witness Juse Maria Fernado was originally an accused named in the

Magistrate Court Non-Summary Inquiry, where he was subsequently

discharged from the proceedings. He is a close relative of the deceased.

According to his evidence, he has seen a crowd on the main road in front of

the Marawila Hospital and the deceased and his brother whom he identified

as Mahaththaya (PW-03) among them. He has also seen them carrying

weapons. After stopping his vehicle near them and after pacifying them, he

has escorted them to their house. When he was about to get onto his vehicle,

he has heard another commotion and when he reached the place which was

at Harold Herath Mawatha, he has seen the deceased with injuries. It was in

his vehicle the deceased had been taken to the hospital. It was his evidence

that when he went towards the commotion, earlier mentioned Mahaththaya

(PW-03) came and informed him that

, which was one of the main contentions of the learned

Presidents Counsel for the 1st and the 3rd appellants to argue that in fact PW-

03 never saw the incident and his evidence was a fabrication.

Page 11 of 22

24. Witness Leelawathi has testified in support of the alibi of the 1st appellant

claiming that he was at her home in Dankotuwa on the alleged day of the

incident, recovering from the injuries he suffered from a vehicle accident.

25. It is also necessary to bear in mind that the learned High Court judge who

wrote the judgment only had the benefit of listening to the evidence of the

defence as all the other evidence had been led before her predecessors.

Submissions on behalf of the Attorney General: -

26. In his submissions to this Court, the learned Senior State Counsel (SSC)

conceded that there was a clear misdirection in the judgment as to the

applicable law when the learned High Court judge shifted the burden of

proving the alibi to the appellants. He accepted that the procedure adopted

in leading section 27 evidence was wrong. Commenting on the consideration

of the evidence of bad character in the judgment, it was his view that what is

necessary to consider is that whether it had caused any prejudice to the

relevant appellant.

27. However, it was his contention that although the defence has taken up the

position that all the defendants pleaded the defence of alibi at the trial, in

fact, only the plea of the 1st appellant can be considered a valid plea of an

alibi. Pointing to the evidence and the dock statements of the appellants

themselves, it was his argument that all the other appellants admittedly had

been in the vicinity of the incident and somewhat connected to it. It was his

view that their denial of any involvement in the incident where the deceased

suffered his injuries, would not amount to a plea of alibi.

28. It was also his argument that even though the learned High Court judge had

not followed the conventional approach in analyzing the evidence of the

prosecution, the prosecution evidence, in fact had been analyzed by the

learned High Court judge while summarizing the evidence, contrary to the

argument that the prosecution evidence had not been analyzed. He went on

to point out several instances in the judgment to support his contention.

Page 12 of 22

29. The learned SSC admitted that PW-03 has only identified the 1st and the 3rd

appellants who were present and the deceased 2nd accused, and the 4th

appellant who was absconding at the time, as the persons known to him in

his evidence. PW-03 was a person who returned to the country few months

before, after a long spell overseas. It was agreed by the learned SSC that his

identification of the other accused would amount to a dock identification in

the absence of an identification parade. However, it was also his argument

that the cross examination of the witness by the defence has established the

identities of the accused and the evidence of the other witnesses have

sufficiently established the identity.

30. Commenting on the argument that the prosecution has failed to lead relevant

evidence before leading in evidence the depositions of PW-01 and PW-02, it

was his position that the prosecution had duly satisfied the Court in that

regard. He brought to the notice of the Court the relevant evidence led before

the High Court.

31. Making legal submissions as to why the Court should allow the judgment to

stand despite the admitted weakness of the judgment, it was his contention

that the judgment should stand against the 1st, 3rd, and the 4th appellants,

and against all the others.

32. Relying on the proviso of Article 138 of the Constitution of the Republic where

it states:

That no judgment, decree or order of any Court shall be reversed or

varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not

prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure

of justice.

It was his view that the misdirection as to the law and the facts by the learned

High Court judge had not prejudiced the rights of the above-mentioned

appellants or occasioned a failure of justice, in view of the proven facts against

them at the trial.

Page 13 of 22

33. He cited the judgment in the case of Mannar Mannan Vs. The Republic of

Sri Lanka (1990) 1 SLR 280 and several other judgments in support of his

contention.

34. The learned SSC also agreed that this is not a fit and proper case, where

sending the case back to the original court for a retrial be considered, given

the fact that this was an incident happened more than twenty years ago and

as all the parties have gone through enough.

Reply submissions: -

35. In reply to the submissions of the learned SSC, it was the contention of the

learned counsel for the appellants that the proviso to Article 138 of the

Constitution can be considered applicable only in a situation where there is

a proper judgment. Elaborating further, it was contended that the learned

trial judge had failed to consider and analyze the evidence of the prosecution

inter say and per say and the contradictions and the omissions pointed out.

It was argued that the proviso can be considered in a situation where there

was a fair trial, whereas, there had been no fair trial in this action. The learned

counsel brought to the notice of the Court that there was not only

misdirection as to the law, but also misperception of evidence. It was also

contended that the appellate Courts should not be a forum to rewrite

judgments, which would amount to playing the role of a Court of first

instance.

Comments on finger print reports: -

36. As the practice of calling for the finger print reports of an accused person

and filing of record before an accused is found guilty, which is a common

practice in our High Courts was also given consideration during the

arguments, I would like to set the record straight as to the relevant provisions

and the law for the benefit of the judges of the High Courts and Magistrates.

Page 14 of 22

37. The relevant section 195 (e) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of

1979 which provides for the calling of the finger prints reports reads as

follows:

195. Upon the indictment being received in the High Court, the judge of

the High Court presiding in the sessions in the High Court holden in the

judicial zone where at the trial is to be held shall:

(e) Caused the accused to be finger-printed and forward the prints

to the Registrar of Finger Prints for examination and report to the

prosecuting State Counsel. (The emphasis is mine)

38. The plain reading of the section is, in itself very much clear which needs no

further clarification. Therefore, it is expected that it is the prosecuting State

Counsel who should be in possession of the finger print report and not the

case record for obvious reasons.

39. It is a basic principle of law that every accused person is presumed innocent

until proven guilty. As such, a trial judge's mind should not be allowed to be

tainted either way by having a finger print report of an accused person in the

case record before a person is found guilty or not guilty for that matter.

40. Therefore, it is the considered view of this Court that every High Court should

be mindful to direct the Registrar of Finger Prints to furnish his report to the

prosecuting Sate Counsel for his reference and not to the Registrar of the High

Court as per the current practice. It is the duty of the prosecuting State

Counsel of the High Court to bring to the notice of the presiding High Court

judge of any previous convictions of an accused person when it is considered

at the appropriate stage for the purposes of sentencing.

Page 15 of 22

Consideration of Grounds of Appeal: -

41. Admittedly, the learned High Court judge has clearly misdirected herself as

to the applicable law when it was stated that the appellants have failed to

prove their alibi by calling sufficient evidence to prove the same.

42. In the case of Banda and Others Vs. The Attorney General (1999) 3 SLR

168, it was held:

There is no burden whatsoever on an accused who puts forward a plea of

alibi and the burden is always on the prosecution to establish beyond

reasonable doubt that the accused was not elsewhere but present at the

time of the commission of the criminal offence.

43. The learned SSC relied on the judgment in the case of Jayatissaa Vs. The

Hon. Attorney General (2010) 1 SLR 279 to contend that even if a proper

evaluation was carried out by the trial judge, she could have rejected the

defence of alibi and still convicted the appellants. Giving the reasons at length

by making use of the evidence of the defence, it was his argument that the

mentioned misdirection by the learned trial judge has not caused prejudice

to the appellants.

44. However, I am not in a position to agree with the submission of the learned

SSC, as the learned High Court judge has failed to consider the prosecution

evidence to come to a finding that whether the prosecution evidence establish

the presence of the appellants at the crime scene in contrary to the plea of

alibi. I find that the learned High Court judge has evaluated the defence

evidence against each other in order to reject the alibi rather than considering

the evidence of the prosecution in relation to the plea of alibi. I am of the view

that the conclusions reached by their Lordships of the Supreme Court in

Jayatissa Vs. Hon. Attorney General (Supra) have been reached based on

the facts and the evaluation of the prosecution evidence by the learned trial

judge in that case. Therefore, I am of the view that substantial prejudice has

Page 16 of 22

been caused to the appellants due the failure to analyze the evidence as to

the plea of alibi in its correct perspective in the instant action.

45. Under the provisions of section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance, when any fact

deposed to as discovered in consequence to information received from a

person accused of any offence, in the custody of a Police officer, so much of

such information, whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates to the

fact thereby discovered may be proved against that person.

46. According to the Evidence led in this action it was OIC Roshan Perera, PW-

08 who has recovered the production marked P-03 based on the statement of

the 1st appellant. The relevant extract of the statement has been marked Y

at the trial. However, the said OIC has not given evidence, but it was PW-12

IP Priyantha who has given evidence and marked the relevant extract. He was

not the person who recorded the statement of the suspect and has not seen

the recovery, but has only driven the vehicle of the OIC. It was his evidence

that the then OIC is now domiciled in Canada.

47. As agreed by the learned SSC, this was not the proper procedure if the

prosecution intended to make use of the section 27 statement as evidence

against the 1st appellant. The prosecution should have taken steps under

section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance before seeking the permission of Court

to admit the said statement as evidence, which has not happened in this

action.

48. I am of the view that using of the statement as evidence against the 1st

appellant by the learned High Court judge was a clear misdirection of law

which has caused prejudice to the 1st appellant and to other appellants in

general.

49. When it comes to an offence committed of being a member of an unlawful

assembly (Section 146 of the Penal Code), and with common intention

(Section 32 of the Penal Code) it clearly appears that the learned High Court

judge has discussed the relevant law in the judgment. However, I find that

discussing the law in itself is not sufficient in a judgment but it is the duty of

a trial judge to consider the evidence in that regard. I find that the learned

Page 17 of 22

High Court judge has considered the evidence taken as a whole with regard

to the above offences in finding the appellants guilty on that basis.

50. Although the learned High Court judge had decided that the evidence of bad

character would not be considered in the judgment, it appears that in fact,

such evidence had been considered in relation to the 3rd appellant.

51. In the case of P.M.Peter Singho Vs. M.B.Werapitiya 55 NLR 155 it was

held:

Where a trial judge has permitted himself, through an improper

appreciation of the law, to allow evidence to be led which is of such a

character as to prejudice the chances of a fair trial on the real issues in the

case, the improper reception of the evidence is fatal in the conviction of the

accused, although the accused has been tried not by lay jurors but by a

Magistrate trained in the law.

52. I am in no position to agree with the contention that the prosecution failed

to satisfy the Court that the prosecution witnesses 02 and 03 cannot be found

to give evidence before the High Court. In fact, the prosecution has led

sufficient evidence in that regard and it was only after satisfying that the said

witnesses cannot be called to testify before the High Court, their depositions

made at the Non-Summary Inquiry has been allowed to be led under the

provisions of section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance. However, the misdirection

is the learned High Court judges failure to consider the inherent weakness

and infirmities of accepting such evidence before deciding to act upon such

evidence.

53. It was brought to the notice of the Court that the learned High Court judge

in the judgment has decided to disregard the contradictions marked and

omissions brought to the notice of the Court on the basis that there was no

order on record as to whether the Court allowed the marking of the

Contradictions and the omissions. However, at the same time, the learned

High Court judge has considered as relevant the omissions brought to the

notice of the Court when the appellants gave evidence in their defence. I find

Page 18 of 22

that the failure of the learned High Court judge to consider whether the

marked contradictions and omissions have any relevancy to the evidence of

the prosecution witnesses amounts to a denial of a fair trial. The learned trial

judge should have considered them in the same way as it was done with

regard to the appellants evidence.

54. The relevant section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979

which deals with the judgments of Courts other than the Supreme Court and

the Court of Appeal reads as follows;

283. The following provisions shall apply to the judgments of courts

other than the Supreme Court or Court of Appeal: -

(1) The judgment shall be written by the judge who heard the

case and shall be dated and signed by him in open court at the

time of pronouncing it, and in case where appeal lies shall

contain the point or points of determination, the decision

thereon, and the reasons for the decision.

(2) It shall specify the offence if any of which and the section of

the law under which the accused is convicted and the

punishment to which he is sentenced.

(3) ..

55. In the judgment under consideration, it can be clearly observed that the

learned High Court judge has failed to analyze the evidence led by the

prosecution in order to prove its case and come to a firm finding that the

prosecution has established a strong prima facie proof against the appellants

before considering whether the appellants have created a reasonable doubt

on the evidence or at least, has offered a reasonable explanation on the

incriminating evidence against them.

Page 19 of 22

56. In order to do so, the trial judge needs to consider the evidence of the

prosecution inter say and per say by analyzing the prosecution evidence

against each other and in relation to the matters elicited in the process of

cross examination of the witnesses. The probability of the evidence and the

credibility of the witnesses in relation to the proven facts needs to be

considered too. When it comes to the present action, where the PW-01 and

PW-03 were at the time of the attack, and whether it was possible for them to

see the attack on the deceased and what was happening around them, needs

to be carefully considered before placing any reliance on their evidence, which

has not happened.

57. The investigating officers failure to observe the alleged damages caused to

the house as mentioned by the witnesses as well as the contradictions with

regard to the 9th appellants role in the evidence of the PW-03 and the

depositions of PW-01 and 02 has not drawn the attention of the learned High

Court Judge in the judgment. Discrepancies with regard to the deposition of

PW-02 and the evidence of PW-03 has not been considered.

58. In the case of Karunadasa Vs. Officer-in-Charge, Motor Traffic Division,

Police Station Nittambuwa (1887) 1 SLR 155 it was stated by Perera, J.

that;

It is an imperative requirement in a criminal case that the prosecution must

be convincing, no matter how weak the defence is, before the Court is

entitled to convict on it. It is necessary to borne in mind that the general rule

is that the burden is on the prosecution, to prove the guilt of the accused.

The prosecution must prove their case apart from any statement made by

the accused or any evidence tendered by him. The weakness of the defence

must not be allowed to bolster up a weak case for the prosecution. The rule

is based on the principle that every man is presumed to be innocent until

the contrary is proved, and criminality is never to be presumed.

59. The issue in the appeal under consideration is not that it was a weak case

for the prosecution, but the learned trial judges failure to consider the

Page 20 of 22

prosecution evidence in its correct perspective and the consideration of the

defence evidence in order to convict the appellants.

60. It was the contention of the learned SSC that although the learned High

Court judge has not followed the conventional approach of writing a

judgment, in fact, the learned High Court judge has analyzed the evidence of

the prosecution witnesses while their evidence was summarized. However, I

am in no position to agree. It appears that while summarizing the prosecution

evidence the learned High Court judge has considered the version of the

defence in comparison to the prosecution evidence in order to consider

whether the defence evidence can be believed. This approach of the learned

High Court judge can in no way considered correct when it comes to the

requirement of analyzing of the evidence of the prosecution.

61. In the case of Chandrasena and others V. Munaweera (1998) 3 S.L.R. 94

at 96, Jayasuriya, J. with reference to several other decided cases of our

Superior Courts stated as follows;

In the decision in Thusaiya Vs. Pathaimany 15 CLW 119 by Nihill J-

According to the presently applicable section 283(1) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No 15 of 1979. The judgment shall contain the point or points

for determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for the decision. In

Verupandian Vs. Sollamuttu 1901, 1 Browns Report 384 the Supreme Court

stressed that the object of the statutory provision is to enable the Supreme

Court to ascertain whether the finding is correct or not. The weight of

authority is to the effect that the failure to observe the imperative provisions

of the section is a fatal irregularity and even in a simple case that the

provisions of the statute must be complied with.

62. In the case of M. Ibrahim Vs. Inspector of Police Ratnapura 59 NLR 235,

it was stated thus;

The learned Magistrates omission to state the reasons for his decision has

deprived the appellant of his fundamental right to have his conviction

Page 21 of 22

reviewed by this Court and has thus occasioned a failure of justice. Without

such reasons, it is impossible for this Court to judge whether the finding is

right or wrong. I therefore, set aside the conviction and sentence and order

a new trial.

63. For the aforementioned reasons, I am of the view that this is not a fit and

proper case where the proviso of Article 138 of the Constitution can be applied

in order to affirm the findings of the learned High Court judge. I find that the

learned High Court judges failure to give due consideration to the evidence

in accordance with the accepted principles of law would amount to a failure

of justice and a denial of a fair trial. Therefore, I have no option but to allow

the appeal of the appellants.

64. The only consideration that can be given at this juncture is whether this is a

fit and proper case to send for a retrial.

65. In the case of Nandana Vs. Attorney General (2008) 1 SLR 51, it was held:

A discretion is vested in the Court whether or not to order a retrial in a fit

case, which discretion should be exercised judicially to satisfy the ends of

justice taking into consideration the nature of the evidence available, the

time duration since the date of the appeal, the period of incarceration the

accused had already suffered, the trauma and hazards an accused person

would have to suffer in being subject to a second trial for no fault on his

part and the resultant traumatic effect in his immediate family members

who have no connection to the alleged crime, should be considered.

66. The learned SSC at the very commencement of the hearing of the appeal

rightly admitted that this is not a case where retrial should be considered

given the fact that this was an incident that took place in the year 2001. Given

the time period and other attendant circumstances as established during the

arguments of this appeal, I hold that this is not a fit and proper case to order

a retrial.

67. Therefore, allowing the appeals as the judgment cannot be allowed to stand,

I set aside the conviction and the sentence of the learned High Court judge.

All the appellants are acquitted of the charges preferred against them.

Appeals allowed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal
