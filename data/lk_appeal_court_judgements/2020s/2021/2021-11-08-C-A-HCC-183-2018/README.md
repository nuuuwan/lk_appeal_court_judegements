R. Gurusinghe, J.

The Accused-Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Avissawella for

trafficking and possession of 0.709 and 7.8 grams of heroin in terms of

Section 52 (A) (b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance

as amended by Act No.13/1984.

After the trial, the learned Trial Judge of the High Court convicted the

appellant and sentenced accordingly.

Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and the conviction appellant

preferred this appeal.

The grounds of appeal against the conviction are that:

1. The learned High Court Judge failed to consider the inconsistency

of the evidence of PW1 and PW2 pertinent to the first information.

2. the contradiction between PW1 and PW4 regarding the bag that

contained the heroin.

3

3. the contradictory nature of the Government Analyst's evidence.

4. the wrong date contained in the Government Analyst's Report.

5. the contradiction of the identification of productions.

6. the credibility of the evidence of PW3.

7. the credibility of the evidence of PW5.

8. the credibility of the evidence of PW6.

9. The learned High Court Judge further failed to consider the

contradictions of the prosecution witnesses.

The Prosecution led the evidence of PW1 to PW6 and marked productions

P1 to P8. The appellant also testified before Court and called two other

witnesses in support of the defence.

Prosecution case:

PW2 had received information from a reliable informant around 10.45

a.m. on the 5th November 2006. He then had conveyed this information

to PW1 who was the principal investigating officer. After that, a group of

police officers had left Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB) and reached

Battaramulla at about 12.10.p.m. where PW2 had met the informant.

The informant had shown the appellant coming out of his house walking

at the road to PW1 and PW2. The informant had then left the place. At

that time, the appellant had a mobile phone and something in his left

hand. PW1 and PW2 ran towards the appellant to search him. At that

moment, the appellant had dropped the parcel. PW1 had instructed PW2

to take the parcel, and PW1 had arrested the appellant. PW2 handed

over the parcel to PW1. The parcel contained heroin. The police team

searched the house of the appellant. The parcel and the appellant were

4

brought to the PNB. The productions were weighed, and there were 155.3

grams of heroin. The production was sealed before the appellant and

kept in the locker of PW1, and it was handed over to PW3 on the

following day. PW3 had handed over the production to the Government

Analyst on 7th November 2006. PW5 had recorded the statement of the

appellant. PW6 had taken the production back from the Government

Analyst to Court.

Defence

The appellant, his wife, and one other witness gave evidence for the

defence. The appellant's position was that he was arrested inside his

house, and the production was introduced to him.

The learned High Court Judge considering the evidence for the

prosecution and that for the defence, had come to the conclusion that

the Prosecution had proved his case beyond reasonable doubt and the

evidence of the witnesses for the defence did not create a reasonable

doubt of the prosecution case.

All the grounds of appeal are based on alleged inconsistencies of the

evidence of Prosecution and the credibility of that evidence.

The first ground of appeal is that PW2 had received information from an

informant that a person residing at Thotalanga area was coming with a

large quantity of heroin. However, PW1 had not mentioned anything

about a person of Thotalanga area in his evidence. The informant was

not a witness and cannot be called as a witness. What had been stated

by the informant would therefore become hearsay and cannot be lead as

evidence. PW2 had said that the informant informed a person coming

from Thotalanga was dealing with heroin. It does not mention that a

person residing at Thotalanga was dealing with heroin. Therefore, saying

5

the name of a person coming from Thotalanga area is not an

inconsistency, and this argument has no merit.

The second ground of appeal is that PW4, a witness from Government

Analyst Department, had not mentioned anything about a blue colour

bag that contained the heroin. PW4 had given evidence that the

production was handed over to the Government Analyst by PW3 and

identified the production marked P3, which bore her signature. The

issue is whether the Government Analyst had examined the same

production taken from the appellant. PW1 stated that the heroin was

contained in a blue-coloured polythene bag which was then put into

another sealable bag.

All the identification tags that PW1 had placed were there. PW1 and PW2

identified P-3. PW4 also referred to those identification tags. The defence

has not taken up that there was no blue colour bag, and therefore, the

production examined by the Government Analyst was not the same

production that was sent to the Government Analyst for this case. No

question was put to the Government Analyst that the production

examined by the Analyst was not the same.

At page 272 of the appeal brief, PW 4, Assistant Government Analyst

stated as follows:

28/1, ,

.

The Government Analyst had stated that there was a polythene bag; the

only thing that she had not mentioned is the colour. However, that bag

was available for inspection of the defence. The defence had not

challenged the evidence of the Assistant Government Analyst on the

basis that the productions analyzed by her were not relevant to this case.

As such, this argument is rejected.

The third and fourth grounds of appeal are that the evidence of the PW4

was contradictory as to whether the production was sent to the

Government Analyst through the Magistrate's Court of Kaduwela or

directly by the PNB.

PW4 had explained as follows at page 298 of the brief:

B/1008/2006

. .

.

There were two P5s that were marked; that is heroin and CD 3187/6.

The correct number is CD 3188/6(page 356 and 359.) The same

stenographer had recorded this evidence. The Government Analysts

report has the same number.

The document is available (at page 20 of the MC Kaduwela original case

record which is a part of the High Court case record.) for inspection of

the Court. It has been marked as P 5 dated 2014/09/10 and initialled by

the Judge. The document speaks for itself. It was a typographical error

that should have been corrected. However, since the document is

available, discrepancy does not create doubt. There was an error in the

date. The witness PW4 had explained that the letter was received on 7th

November 2006, and it was wrongly typed as 7/1/2006. The learned

High Court Judge had considered all these discrepancies.

The fifth ground is that PW1 and PW4 stated that the productions

number was PR 117/2006. However, PW2 stated that it was PR

110/2006. It could be either PW2 wrongly stated the number, or the

stenographer wrongly recorded it. The learned High Court Judge has

considered this discrepancy. However, this was not something that the

defence has cross-examined. Therefore, there is no merit in this ground.

The sixth ground is that PW3 had handed over the Government Analyst

slip to Gangodawila Magistrate's Court. The slip is available in the case

record, and it is clear that it was handed over to the Magistrate's Court of

Kaduwela. Therefore, the statement is clearly a mistake. No question

was put to PW2 in this regard. When the document is available, no oral

evidence is necessary to prove the same. Therefore, this argument has no

merit.

8

The seventh ground is that whether the statement of the appellant was

recorded at the PNB or at the appellant's house. The learned High Court

Judge has considered this discrepancy and observed that no questions

were put to clarify it. However, she also observed that PW3 recorded the

appellant's statement, and the appellant had refused to sign it.

The eighth ground is that PW6 had taken six hours to go to the

Government Analyst Department from the PNB. However, PW6 had

explained that he had not taken six hours to go to the Government

Analyst Department. However, he had to wait until 14.28 to hand over

the production to the Assistant Government Analyst, Mrs. Umagaliya.

(Pages 364 and 365 of the appeal brief). Therefore, this argument cannot

be accepted.

The ninth ground is that contradiction between PW1 and PW2 has not

been considered. What had been pointed out as contradictions were not

on the essential points. One point raised as a contradiction is about the

stuff the police team had taken with them. PW1 and PW2 had not been

cross-examined as to any difference between their evidence.

The registration number of the vehicle is also shown as a contradiction.

PW1 said that the vehicle number was 32 Sri 7485. PW2 stated that the

vehicle number was 32 Sri 3485. There is a difference of one digit. This

is probably a typographical error. However, this is not a contradiction

that would create a reasonable doubt of the prosecution case.

The learned High Court Judge has considered every point raised by the

defence and concluded that there were no contradictions that would

shake the prosecution case. PW1 and PW5 had clearly stated that only

PW5 was in the uniform. PW2 had said that all of them were in civil

attire. The learned High Court Judge has considered this difference.

9

Another point raised for the appellant is that the position of PW 1 was

that the appellant had come out of his house to by the road 3-4 times

and as per the evidence of PW 2 at the first occasion he was coming out

they arrested him. This is not correct; PW2 had said (at 226 of the appeal

brief) that the appellant had come out to the road 2-3 times. Hence there

is no inconsistency as alleged by the appellant.

The prosecution version was consistent and believed by the learned High

Court Judge. The learned trial Judge has considered and evaluated the

evidence for the defence as well; there is no complaint in that regard.

It is not fair to come to an adverse finding on contradictions or omissions

that were not brought to the notice of the Trial Court and witnesses who

had not been allowed to explain the purported omissions. (See

Dharmasiri Vs. Republic of Sri Lanka 2010 2 Sri LR 241) The credibility of

a witness is mainly a matter for the Trial Judge. Court of Appeal will not

lightly disturb the findings of Trial Judge with regard to the credibility of

a witness unless such findings are manifestly wrong.

In the case of Fradd Vs. Brown and Co. Ltd 20 NLR 282, Privy Council

held thus:

"It is rare that a decision of a Judge so express, so explicit, upon a

point of fact purely, is over-ruled by a Court of Appeal, because the

Courts of Appeal recognize the priceless advantage which a judge of

first instance has in matters of that kind, as contrasted with any

Judge of a Court of Appeal, who can only learn from paper or from

narrative of those who were present. It is very rare that, in questions

of veracity so direct and so specific as these, a Court of Appeal will

overrule a Judge of first instance."

10

In Alwis Vs. Piyasena Fernando 1992 1 Sri LR 119 His Lordship's GPS.

De Silva CJ. Stated thus:

"It is well established that findings of primary facts by a Trial Judge

who hears and sees witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed on

appeal."

All the grounds of appeal are based on questions of facts of the case and

the credibility of witnesses. No questions of law were raised in the

appeal. In this case, the same Judge had heard the entirety of the

evidence. The Trial Judge had seen the demeanour and deportment of all

witnesses.

For the reasons set out above, I hold that the Trial Judge, after due

consideration of the evidence led at the trial, has correctly found the

appellant guilty of the charges, and as such, no reason to interfere with

the Judgment. The appeal is dismissed.
