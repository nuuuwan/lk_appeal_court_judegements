Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the defendant-appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the appellant) on being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence of

him by the learned High Court Judge of Nuwaraeliya.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Nuwaraeliya for

committing the offence of murder of one Kandasamy Sellamani,

punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, the appellant was found guilty as charged and

was sentenced to death.

Facts that led to the death of the deceased Sellamani as established by

way of evidence at the trial are briefly as follows;

Page 3 of 13

The deceased was living with the appellant in an illicit relationship and

they had two children by the union. The appellant was a married man

whose wife was employed overseas. According to the evidence of PW-01

who was the father of the deceased, his daughter and the appellant lived

in matrimony in a house owned by him, which was situated near his

house in the tea estate where they lived. According to him, there were

constant quarrels between them due to the drunkenness of the

appellant. It was his evidence that on the day of the incident where the

deceased suffered burn injuries, namely, on the 19th of August 2009, his

daughter came to his house in a state of shock at around 11.00 pm

with the youngest child of about one year old and informed that the

appellant came home drunk and assaulted her. About fifteen minutes

later, the appellant Krishnakumar came and wanted him to open the

door. Upon his refusal, the appellant forcibly opened the door by

breaking the nearby window and after assaulting the deceased, dragged

her to the house where they lived, leaving the child with him.

Thereafter, in about another fifteen minutes they returned, with his

daughter having burn injuries all over her body and she informed him

that Krishnakumar the appellant, poured Kerosine oil on her and set fire

to her. It was his evidence that he could not take her to the hospital as

he was a sick person and although he asked the appellant to take her to

the hospital, he took her back to their house and it was only in the she

was taken to the hospital by the appellant where she died seven days

later.

Apart from the evidence of PW-01 and the other witnesses, the

prosecution has relied on the four dying declarations made by the

deceased on four occasions before her death in order to prove the case

against the appellant. The four occasions are as follows;

Page 4 of 13

(1) The statement made to her father shortly after the incident.

(2) The statement made to her brother after he visited her at the

hospital.

(3) Statement made to the doctor who examined the deceased.

(4) Statement made to the Police officer who recorded her

statement while she was receiving treatment at the hospital.

It is noteworthy to mention that the appellant has failed to setup any

defence while cross examining the witnesses other than questioning

them on the facts. When called for a defence, he has made a statement

from the dock and has pretended that the deceased was unknown to

him. Further, he has claimed that on the day of the incident, after

coming home from Colombo, he went to see his sister who lived in

Maanikka estate after receiving a message from her. According to the

dock statement, while walking towards his sisters house at about 9.30

pm in the night, he has seen a house on fire and it was he who doused

the fire. Upon seeing the deceased whom she described as with

burn injuries, he claims that he inquired her as to where she wants to go

and it was only on her directions that he was able to take her to the

house of her father. It was his position that her father refused to take her

in and although he attempted to find a vehicle to take her to the hospital,

he could not, and thereafter he took her back to the burned house, kept

her there and went to his sisters house. He has stated that since he

found the deceased still in the burned house on his way back to his

home, on the following morning, he took steps to admit her to the

hospital and it was he who admitted her to the hospital.

Apart from making a dock statement, the appellant has called his legally

married wife to testify that she was legally married to him. Her evidence

also reveals that at the time of the incident, she was employed in the

Middle East and was completely unaware of her husbands illicit

Page 5 of 13

relationship. The Grama Niladari of the area where the appellant lived

has testified as to the appellant's residence and the Doctor who admitted

the deceased to Dikoya hospital has also been called to give evidence.

It is clear from the judgment of the learned High Court judge that the

appellant was found guilty as charged, based on the circumstantial

evidence made available and the dying declarations of the deceased.

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned counsel for the appellant urged

following two grounds of appeal to formulate her arguments.

(1) The learned trial judge who delivered the judgment failed to

adopt the evidence led before his predecessors under the

provisions of section 48 of the Judicature Act as required,

hence, the judgment is bad in law.

(2) The learned trial judge has failed to consider the evidence led at

the trial, which warrant the consideration of grave and sudden

provocation of the appellant which stems from the dying

declaration of the victim made to the Police officer.

First Ground of Appeal: -

Section 48 of the Judicature Act relied on by the learned counsel reads

as follows;

Section 48: -

In the case of death, sickness, resignation, removal from

office, absence from Sri Lanka, or other disability of any Judge

before whom any action, prosecution, proceeding or matter,

whether on any inquiry preliminary to committal for trial or

otherwise, has been instituted or is pending, such action,

prosecution, proceeding or matter may be continued before

the successor of such Judge who shall have power to act on

Page 6 of 13

the evidence already recorded by his predecessor, or partly

recorded by his predecessor and partly recorded by him or, if

he thinks fit, to re-summon the witness and commence the

proceedings afresh:

Provided that where any criminal prosecution, proceeding or

matter (except on an inquiry preliminary to committal for

trial) is continued before the successor of any such judge, the

accused may demand that the witnesses be resummoned and

reheard.

The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant is on the premise

that the learned High Court judge who concluded the evidence and

pronounced the judgment failed to comply with the requirements of the

section by failing to adopt the evidence previously led before his

predecessor.

I find that the plain reading of section 48 of the Judicature Act as

amended by Act No 27 of 1999 is very much clearer as to the intention of

the legislature. The intention has been to provide for the conclusion, as

expeditiously as possible, a trial commenced before another judge

without causing prejudice to an accused person. The legislature in its

wisdom has provided for the trial judge to continue with the trial by

acting on the evidence previously recorded by his predecessor, but by the

proviso of the section has provided an opportunity for an accused in a

criminal prosecution to demand that the witness may be re-summoned

and reheard ensuring the right of an accused for a fair trial.

In the instant action the accused has been represented throughout the

trial by the same counsel. I find that the evidence has been recorded

before several High Court judges and the main witnesses have given

evidence and the dying declarations have been marked before the learned

High Court judge who commenced hearing of the evidence. The parties

Page 7 of 13

have agreed to adopt the evidence before the succeeding judge on 03-03-

2016. Thereafter, the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer who

conducted the post mortem and of a court official has been led. After the

conclusion of the evidence for the prosecution it was he who has decided

to call for a defence.

When the matter came up for further trial on 04-04-2017 before the

learned High Court judge who subsequently concluded the case, and

pronounced the judgement, the following minute has been placed on the

record by the learned judge, and accordingly had proceeded to hear

evidence for the defence.

.

.

Although the learned Trial judge has not used the words directly

indicating the adoption of proceedings, I am of the view that the learned

trial judge was very much mindful of the provisions of section 48 of the

Judicature Act as it provides only for the continuation of the proceedings

before him, when he placed on record the above minute. I am of the view

that if it was the intention of the accused to re-summon witnesses, it was

up to the accused appellant to make such a demand, which he has failed

to do.

In the instant action, the appellant has not demanded the re-

summoning of the witnesses before the successor of the original trial

judge who heard most of the witnesses including the evidence of PW-01.

Without making use of his right to demand before the successor of the

original trial judge, and after agreeing for the continuation of the trial,

before the judge who ultimatly concluded the trial, the appellant has no

Page 8 of 13

basis to argue that he was denied of a fair trial, hence, the ground of

appeal urged has no merit.

Second Ground of Appeal: -

An accused person charged with committing the offence of murder as

described in section 294 of the Penal Code can rely on the exceptions

provided for in the section to contend that it was not murder but

culpable homicide.

The relevant section 294 Exception 1 relied on by the learned counsel to

argue that the learned trial judge has failed to consider the evidence

available on provocation of the appellant reads thus;

Exception 1- culpable homicide is not murder if the offender

whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and

sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave

the provocation, or causes the death of any other person by

mistake or accident.

The above exception is subject to following provisos: -

Firstly- that the provocation is not sought or voluntarily

provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or

doing harm to any person.

Secondly -that the provocation is not given by anything

done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant, in

the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant.

Thirdly- that the provocation was not given by anything

done in the lawful exercise of the right of private

defence.

Page 9 of 13

Explanation- whether the provocation was grave and

sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting

to murder is a question of fact.

As stated earlier, the appellant has never taken up the defence of grave

and sudden provocation before the trial judge and in fact has pretended

that the deceased was unknown to him. However, it was the contention

of the learned counsel for the appellant that it was the duty of the trial

judge to consider the evidence as to the grave and sudden provocation in

a judgment, although it was not the defence of an accused person.

Citing several decided cases of our superior courts to formulate her

argument, it was the contention of the learned counsel that in the dying

declaration the deceased made to her brother, she has stated that

because one Bala came, the appellant assaulted and set fire on her. It

was further contended that even in the statement the deceased made to

the Police, marked P-01 at the trial, she has admitted that because she

scolded her husband, he set fire on her.

Relying on the above, it was the contention of the learned counsel that

there was sufficient evidence for the learned trial judge to act under

section 294 Exception 1 and the learned trial judge has failed to address

his mind to the exception of grave and sudden provocation.

Nagalingam S.P.J. in K.D.J.Perera Vs. The King (1951) 53 NLR 193 at

201 discuses what should be established to claim the benefit of section

294 Exception 1.

Under our law, what has to be established by a prisoner who

claims the benefit of exception 1, in section 294 of the Penal Code is:

Page 10 of 13

(1) that he was given provocation,

(2) that the provocation was sudden,

(3) that the provocation was grave,

(4) that as a result of the provocation given, he lost his powers of

self- control,

(5) that whilst deprived of the power of self-control he committed the

act that resulted in the death of the victim.

It was stated further, at 202,

Under our law neither the presence of an intention to kill would

preclude the formulation of a successful plea based on grave and

sudden provocation nor that words by themselves would not be

sufficient to cause provocation.

Hence, for an accused person to succeed in a plea of grave and sudden

provocation the above grounds need to be established by evidence led

before the trial court.

Accordingly, the next matter to be considered in relation to the facts of

the instant action is the mode of proof required of a plea of grave and

sudden provocation, as the appellant had not pleaded such an exception

nor has led any evidence on such a basis, but has denied any

involvement with the setting fire on the deceased, and even has gone on

to the extent of denying knowing her before the incident.

In his exhaustive judgment on the question of grave and sudden

provocation and the mode of proof of such a plea, A.H.M.D.Nawaz, J (As

he was then) in the case of Kulanthaivel Ramesh alias Vishvalingam

Sasikumar Vs. The Attorney General, C.A.Appeal Case No-16/2013

Page 11 of 13

decided on 27-03-2015 at page 07 with reference to several previously

decided cases held:

"No doubt Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance places the burden

of proving a general or special exception on an accused in the event

that he pleads such an exception and the Divisional Bench by a

majority of 6 to 1 declared in The King v James Chandrasekera 44

N.L.R 97 that the standard of proof of these exceptions is on a

balance of probabilities but there are a number of decisions that lay

down the rule that such a burden does not exist where it is manifest

from the evidence for the prosecution that the plea must be upheld-

vide The King v Sellammai (1931) 32 N.L.R 351; 8 T.L.R 143.

Therefore, it follows that the burden of proof of an exception may be

discharged not only by the evidence for the prosecution but also by

the evidence for the defence or both.

Courts have gone to the extent of holding that even if the accused

denies the allegation in toto, mitigatory circumstances must be

considered by the jury if the evidence unfolds such circumstances.

Thus, in The Queen v Sinnathamby (1965) 68 N.L.R 195 the Court of

Criminal Appeal held that even though the defence was a total

denial of the acts which caused the death, the judge was justified in

putting the question of insanity to the jury."

Held further at page 08 that,

Thus, we distil the wisdom in these cases namely no burden of a

general or special exception is undertaken by an accused if such an

exception arises on the prosecution evidence or evidence led for the

defence or both. I hold that this proposition is consistent with the

stipulations contained in section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance.

That section casts the burden on an accused of proving the existence

of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general or

Page 12 of 13

special exceptions in the Penal Code or within a proviso contained in

any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the law and

the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances. If the

existence of the extenuating circumstances stipulated in the

exceptions and provisos of the Penal Code or even the elements

constituting a defence contained in a law are brought out by the

evidence that emerges at the trial, whether it be that of the

prosecution or defence, then the Court does not have to presume the

absence of those circumstances and Section 105 will have no

application in such a situation. In such a situation there will be no

burden as required by Section 105 as the extenuating circumstances

have already emerged at the trial. When such extenuating

circumstances arise, it is the duty of the trial judge to leave the issue

of extenuation to the jury.

In the case of R.M.Karunaratne Vs. The Attorney General

C.A.181/2009, H.C.Puttlam 84/05 decided on 21.11.2011, held:

If the plea of grave and sudden provocation is available from the

evidence of the prosecution itself, court has a duty to consider such

a plea even if the accused did not raise it.

The above line of authorities clearly establishes that for a trial judge to

consider whether there was grave and sudden provocation, there must be

evidence, either by the prosecution or the defence. It is quite apparent

from the evidence made available to the learned trial judge there were no

evidence as such, and hence, there was no basis for him to consider the

evidence under section 294 Exception 1.

I do not find any basis to consider the statement the deceased made to

her brother as to the reason for the setting fire on her by the appellant

and the statement she made to the Police about her scolding the

appellant as sufficient evidence to establish the Exception1, as envisaged

Page 13 of 13

by section 294. The evidence establishes that the appellant was in the

habit of assaulting and illtreating the deceased after consuming liquor.

On the day in question, she has come to her fathers house seeking

shelter after being assaulted by the appellant. The appellant who came

after her, has forced open the door of the house and had dragged the

deceased away and had set fire on her.

Even after setting her on fire, the appellant has failed to take her to a

hospital and had only done so in the following morning, which goes on to

establish his intention beyond reasonable doubt. The statement made by

the deceased to the Police while in hospital (P-01), if read as a whole,

clearly shows the reason why she scolded the appellant which cannot be

considered a provocation that warrants setting fire on the deceased, if it

can be even remotely considered a provocation.

For the reasons stated as above, I am unable to find any merit in the

second ground of appeal either.

The appeal therefore is dismissed, as I find no reasons to interfere with

the conviction and the sentence imposed on the appellant.
