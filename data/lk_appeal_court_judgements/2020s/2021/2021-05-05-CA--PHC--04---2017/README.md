Decided On 05.05.2021

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeal has been lodged to set aside the order dated 2.2.2017 of

the learned High Court Judge of Kegalle.

The accused respondent (hereinafter referred to as the respondent) has been

initially charged in the Magistrate Court of Kegalle for selling a packet of sugar

which had expired and he has appeared as the owner of the shop. But when

the respondent pleaded guilty to the charge sheet when he was to be

sentenced the respondent had confessed that he was not the owner. Then

the magistrate had directed the police to commence investigations against

the suspect for impersonation and a new charge sheet had been filed for

impersonation under the penal code. Evidence had been led and upon

conclusion of the prosecution case the respondent counsel had made an

application under section 186 of the Code Criminal Procedure Code to

discharge the respondent, but instead the magistrate has amended the

charge by merely deleting a name in the charge.

The position of the appellant is that at the end of the prosecution case when

the magistrate is requested to act under section 186 of the CPC amending the

charge is illegal and deletion of a name is not a proper amendment under

section 167(3) of the CPC. The petitioner further says that the learned High

Court Judge also has erred by upholding the same order.

The learned Counsel appearing for the Attorney General had raised the

following grounds,

1) The petition of appeal not properly drafted on the basis that it is not clear

whether it is an application of revision or appeal, and if it is a revision

application no exceptional grounds have been urged in the oral submissions

of the petitioner,

2) Grounds of appeal also not properly stated in the petition of appeal,

3) The instant application being a frivolous one in nature and costs to be

considered upon dismissal.

Upon perusal of the petition of appeal this court also observes that the

caption has stated the application to be a revision application in nature, and

the body of the petition and the prayer has stated it to be an appeal, and the

grounds of appeal has been stated as to be illegal but the grounds of

illegality has not been identified. It is well accepted and trite law that a

petition of appeal shall state the grounds of appeal and if it is on a point of

law the petition must identify as to what the point of law is. Furthermore this

court also observes that the petition of appeal does not highlight any of the

documents that had been referred to in the petition of appeal. Procedure

regarding appeals from the Magistrates Court to the Court of Appeal and

Page 4 of 5

appeals from the High Court to the Court of Appeal had been laid down in the

CPC. The same had been laid down in the Supreme Court rules as well.

But upon perusing the instant petition of appeal this court observes that the

provisions of the CPC in drafting a petition of appeal has been grossly

violated.

Therefore the observations of this court are, as with regard to the first

ground of objection by the counsel for the Attorney General is well founded

and the appeal brief is a violation of the appellate court rules and provisions

of the CPC.

But in the case ofKiriwanthi vs. Navaratne 1990(2) Sri. L.R.393 Fernando J

has stated that The weight of Authority thus favors the view that while these

rules must be complied with, the law does not require or permit automatic

dismissal of application..The consequence of non-compliance is a matter

falling within the discretion of court, to be exercised after considering the

nature of the default, as well as the excuse or explanation .

Further to the above the counsel appearing for the Attorney General stated

that although the appellant made oral submissions with regard to the

illegality in the order of the learned Magistrate and the High Court Judge he

has not been specific in pointing as to what the illegality in the said orders

are.

This court observes that under section 167(1) of the CPC a charge or

indictment can be amended at any time of the trial till the time of the

judgment but section 167(3) of the CPC defines exactly as to what an

alteration is, and it reads as The substitution of one charge to another in an

indictment or the addition of a new charge to an indictment and in the

Page 5 of 5

Magistrates Court the substitution of one charge to another or the addition of

a new charge shall be deemed to be an alteration of such indictment or

charge..within the meaning of this section.

In the instant case the position of the petitioner is that the, amendment by

the learned magistrate in the charge is one of deletion of a name, and under

section 167 (3) of the CPC it does not amount to an alteration and if that is so

the accused should have been acquitted.

Therefore although the instant petition of appeal has been shoddily drafted

and the appeal brief has been carelessly prepared the point of law taken up

by the petitioner is justified in view of the provisions of the CPC. Therefore as

stated in the decided case law cited above, mere technicalities in procedure

should not hamper the due administration of justice.

Therefore it is the considered view of this court that in view of Magistrate

failing to follow the provisions of the CPC the Magistrates order dated 27.6.14

is illegal and therefore it is hereby set aside and the learned High Court Judges

order too, which upheld the order of the Magistrates dated 2.2.17 is hereby

set aside and the instant application for revision is allowed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
