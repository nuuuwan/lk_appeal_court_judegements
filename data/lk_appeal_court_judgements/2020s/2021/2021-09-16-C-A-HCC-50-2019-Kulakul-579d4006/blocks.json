Although the police witnesses for the prosecution clearly denied going to Carders house in the morning, defence called independent police witnesses to show that officers from the Narcotics Bureau had raided Caders house in the morning by 11.30 am. It was the evidence of the police officer PC Dissanayake who was called by the defence, that on 25.04.2013 when he was on duty at Wellampitiya police station he received a message from 118 center at 11.30 am that some persons had entered Caders house and assaulted Cader. He had referred it to PC 49687 Jayasuriya.",

    "text": "9. The said PC 49687 Jayasuriya also has been called to testify by the defence. On receiving the said message, he had gone to Caders house to find that the officers from the Narcotics Bureau had come to Caders house. He had gone to the extent of checking the identity card of an officer to confirm that they were from Narcotics Bureau. Although the two independent police officers called by the defence were cross examined by the state counsel for the prosecution, their testimony was unchallenged. Thus, it is clear that officers of the Narcotics Bureau had gone to Caders house in the morning by 11.30 am, although PW1 and PW2 denied any officer from the Bureau going there in the morning. The learned High Court Judge in his judgment has said that the defence witnesses had failed to state whether Cader was there when DW 2 Jayasuriya went to Caders house. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the defence evidence in the right perspective. The fact remains that the officers from the Narcotics Bureau had gone to Caders house although PW1 and PW2 both denied they went there in the morning. Therefore, the evidence of PW1 and PW2 cannot be considered credible and it is unsafe to convict the appellant on their evidence. 10. In case of Dharmasiri V.
