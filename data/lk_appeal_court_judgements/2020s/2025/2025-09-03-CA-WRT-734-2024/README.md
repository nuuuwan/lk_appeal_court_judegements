JUDGEMENT

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J.

1. The petitioner, an LL.B. graduate from the Buckinghamshire New

University, has submitted an application to be admitted to the Sri

Lanka Law College. The said application is marked P-15 and P-18. The

same had been rejected by the Incorporated Council of Legal Education,

the 1st respondent, and the 2nd respondent, the Principal of the Sri

Lanka Law College conveyed the same by email dated 26.09.2024 (vide

WRT/0734/24

Page 3 of 12

P-17). The petitioner, by prayer (c), is seeking a writ of certiorari to quash

the said decision; by prayer (e), is seeking a writ of mandamus directing

the 1st and/or the 2nd respondent to approve the petitioners application

for admission as an Attorney-at-Law student and by prayer (f) is seeking

a mandamus directing the 1st and/or 2nd respondent to afford an

opportunity to the petitioner to place before the 1st respondent material

to satisfy the said respondents to justify his eligibility. Those being the

writs sought, the petitioner, by paragraphs (d) and (g), are also seeking

an Order calling for all the minutes of the 1st respondent, in relation to

the consideration of the petitioners application, and also a direction

that the 1st and/or the 2nd respondent to file in Court such minutes.

2. Learned Deputy Solicitor General Manohara Jayasinghe appeared for

the 1st and the 5th respondents. The objections of the said respondents

were tendered on 18.03.2025. Thereafter, as directed by Court, the

minutes of the meetings held on 27.08.2024 of the 1st respondent, and

that of the Board of Studies dated 12.03.2024, were tendered along with

a motion dated 03.07.2025, copies of which were made available to the

petitioner. The counter affidavit of the petitioner was filed prior to that

on 01.04.2025. This was taken up for argument on 05.06.2025, and

07.07.2025. Both parties were permitted to file their post-argument

written submissions which the petitioners filed on 06.08.2025 and the

respondents filed on 05.08.2025. Accordingly, this judgement is now

pronounced.

3. As to the facts; the petitioner, upon obtaining his LL.B., has preferred

the application P-15 and P-18 seeking admission to the Sri Lanka Law

College. According to the said application, the petitioner has disclosed,

under item 8, that he had been charged or convicted for a criminal

matter and that the High Court Judge has imposed 01 years

imprisonment each for offences under Sections 120 and 291B of the

Penal Code. The said sentence was suspended for 2 years together with

Rs. 1500 State costs, in Case No. HC 2973/2021, so concluded on

WRT/0734/24

Page 4 of 12

26.04.2022. It is common ground that the rejection of the application

was in view of the said criminal matter. The original indictment

contained a charge under Section 3(3) read with Section 3(1) of the

ICCPR Act, No. 56 of 2007, and a second charge under Section 291B of

the Penal Code. However, upon the service of this indictment, as the

petitioner had agreed to conclude this matter by pleading guilty, the

State Counsel had amended the 1st count and substituted the same

with a charge under Section 120 of the Penal Code. The petitioner had

then pleaded guilty. The learned High Court Judge upon considering

the submissions, had imposed sentences of 01 years rigorous

imprisonment for each of the counts and also imposed Rs. 1500 State

cost for Count No. 1. The respective jail sentences have been suspended

for 2 years, acting under 303 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

The learned High Court Judge has specifically stated that the sentence

imposed on the 1st count will have no effect on his law degree, and then

stated that the sentence should not be an impediment to the obtaining

of the law degree and functioning as an Attorney-at-Law in the future.

Finally, it is also ordered that the 1st accused, namely the petitioner in

this matter, be released upon payment of the State cost and also made

ordered that the petitioner be fingerprinted [vide P-14 (c)].

4. It was thus submitted that in view of the said order and the provisions

of Section 303 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the pleading

guilty and the concluding of the matter in that manner should not affect

or be an impediment to his admission to the Sri Lanka Law College. It

was also the submission that whilst the petitioner admits making the

relevant utterances as alleged in the charges, the same was made in

2013 and immediately thereafter he has expressed his regret and

sought forgiveness, which clearly demonstrates that he was genuinely

repenting, and has reformed himself, which entitled him and his

application be accepted notwithstanding the said criminal matter.

WRT/0734/24

Page 5 of 12

5. As opposed to that, the respondents position, as submitted by the

learned DSG, is that the petitioner does not have a right to be admitted

to the Sri Lanka Law College and the said decision to reject and not to

accept this application was a decision taken by the 1st respondent

Council of Legal Education. In support of which, copies of the relevant

Council minute were tendered. The learned DSG submitted that

admission to the Law College is a matter exclusively within the purview

of the 1st respondent and the fact that the petitioner was indicted in

respect of a serious offence and he admitting liability and pleading

guilty to the amended charges by itself is a relevant matter

notwithstanding the imposition of the suspended sentence and State

cost.

6. In the written submissions of the petitioner, it is submitted that the

document (minutes) tendered along with a motion should not be

accepted or considered, as they are not supported by any affidavit. The

petitioner prayed that this Court call for and obtain the said minutes

[vide prayers (d) and (g)]. In view of which, this Court did direct so and

the respondents did submit the same with a motion dated 03.07.2025.

The petitioner did have notice of this when the matter was taken up for

further argument on 07.07.2025. No objection was raised as to these

two documents then. They were referred to and adverted to in the

course of the arguments.

7. However, as the petitioner raised the said objection in the post-

argument written submission, the parties were appraised of this issue

when this was mentioned for judgement on 02.09.2025. The learned

Counsel for the petitioner did reiterate the objection. Accordingly, the

respondents were permitted and directed to tender an affidavit in

support of the said minutes, tendered along with the motion dated

03.07.2025. An affidavit of the 2nd respondent, the current Principal,

was submitted in support of the said minutes. Accordingly, the said

minutes can now be considered and acted upon. In these

WRT/0734/24

Page 6 of 12

circumstances, the said two documents (minutes) are produced to this

Court in view of the application made by the petitioner. Thus, I see no

merit in the belated objection taken in the written submission.

Accordingly, the same is rejected and disregarded.

8. Entering the Sri Lanka Law College is for the purpose of finally seeking

enrolment and admission as an Attorney-at-Law. The sole discretion

and power to admit and enrol Attorneys-at-Law is vested with the

Supreme Court by virtue of the provisions of Section 40 of the

Judicature Act, which reads as follows:

40. Attorneys at law.

(1) The Supreme Court may in accordance with rules for the time

being in force admit and enrol as Attorneys at law persons of good

repute and of competent knowledge and ability.

However, a person may be so considered only if such person has duly

passed the Attorney-at-Law Examinations held by the Sri Lanka Law

College, and is of good repute, of competent knowledge and ability. The

governing body of the Sri Lanka Law College is the Incorporated Council

of Legal Education. Under Article 136 (1) (g) of the Constitution, the

Chief Justice, with three Judges of the Supreme Court nominated by

His Lordship, is empowered to make rules in respect of the admission,

enrolment, suspension, and removal of Attorneys-at-Law.

Correspondingly, the Incorporated Council of Legal Education is

empowered to make regulations with the concurrence of the Minister

under Section 7 of the Council of Legal Education ordinance.

9. These rules and statutes provide for the process by which Attorneys-at-

Law obtain their required qualification and seek enrolment and

admission to the legal profession. The process that culminates in the

admission and enrolment commences with the admission of such person

to the Sri Lanka Law College. The professional qualification and the

academic qualification in the field of law are clearly different and

WRT/0734/24

Page 7 of 12

distinct. Sri Lanka Law College provides the professional qualification

required to enrol as an Attorney-at-Law.

10. The petitioners complaint is that his application to gain entrance to the

Sri Lanka Law College had been rejected without him being heard. The

material placed before this Court clearly establishes that the petitioner

has submitted an application on the prescribed form, disclosing a

criminal matter that which is relevant. According to the minutes of the

Incorporated Council of Legal Education meeting held on 12.03.2024,

the Principal of the Sri Lanka Law College has placed before the Council

the issue of the suspended sentence to consider the eligibility and if the

applicant is qualified to enter the Law College. The clarification sought

is whether the High Court can decide on the applicants eligibility for the

Sri Lanka Law College and if the offence/suspended sentence of one-

year imprisonment lead the applicant to be unqualified to enter Sri Lanka

Law College.

11. It is apparent that a copy of the indictment, the judgement, and other

relevant proceedings have been made available to the Council at this

juncture. The Council had adverted to the fact of the Character

Certificates tendered along with the application, and also raised the

question as to whether such a student could take oaths, and also noted

that it is a matter for the Supreme Court. The Council had also

considered and adverted to the fact of the seriousness of the charge in

the indictment. Upon so deliberating the Council had been of the view,

that this student should not be admitted as a student. To that extent, it

is clear and apparent that the decision to reject and not accept the

application of the petitioner had been made upon considering the

relevant material. It is further relevant to note that prior to the decision

of the Incorporated Council of Legal Education, the Principal of the Sri

Lanka Law College has also placed this matter for consideration by the

Board of Studies of the Incorporated Council of Legal Education who

had directed the Principal to obtain the material and submit it to the

WRT/0734/24

Page 8 of 12

Council. Accordingly, upon the decision of the Incorporated Council of

Legal Education (vide minute dated 12.03.2024), the Principal has

conveyed the same to the petitioner.

12. As stated above, the substantive complaint of the petitioner is the

failure to afford him an opportunity to be heard, i.e., the denial of his

right to be heard. It is no doubt a cardinal principle of administrative

law that no person shall be condemned without a hearing; the audi

alteram partem rule being the first and foremost principle of natural

justice. (Kanda v. Government of Malaya [1962] AC 322 at 337, per

Lord Denning: If the right to be heard is to be a real right which is worth

anything, it must carry with it a right in the accused man to know the case

which is made against him.) However, it is equally settled that this rule

does not apply in its full rigour to every situation. According to Tucker

LJ, in Russell v. Duke of Norfolk [1949] 1 All ER 109, 118:

The requirements of natural justice must depend on the

circumstances of the case, the nature of the inquiry, the rules under

which the tribunal is acting, the subject-matter that is being dealt

with, and so forth.

13. The Sri Lankan courts have also applied the same principle, where

Mark Fernando, J., in Karunadasa vs. Unique Gemstones Ltd. and

others [1997] 1 Sri L.R. 256 held (at page 2..) as follows:

To say that Natural Justice entitles a party to a hearing does not

mean merely that his evidence and submissions must be heard

and recorded; it necessarily means that he is entitled to a reasoned

consideration of the case which he presents.

Further, Janak de Silva, J., in Eco Life (Pvt) Ltd v. Rangana Fernando

CA Writ 256/14 (CAM 18.10.2019) observed that:

The application of the rules of natural justice can be excluded from

the administrative decision-making process. The duty to act fairly

may be satisfied in different ways depending on the circumstances

of the case.

WRT/0734/24

Page 9 of 12

His Lordship relied on Saeed v. Minister for Immigration and

Citizenship [(2010) HCA 23; 241 CLR 252] where the High Court of

Australia held that Natural justice is flexible and adaptable to the

circumstances of the particular case. In the present matter, the

petitioner himself disclosed in his application the fact of his indictment

and conviction. The record also demonstrates that the Council had

before it the indictment, the sentencing order, and the character

certificates of the petitioner when deliberating his eligibility (vide

minutes dated 27.08.2024 and 12.03.2024). Then, in R. v. Gaming

Board for Great Britain, ex parte Benaim & Khaida [1970] 2 QB

417, Lord Denning MR at page 430 remarked that administrative bodies

engaged in determinations of character and fitness are not required to

conduct hearings like courts of law; rather, factual fairness may be

satisfied through alternative means.

They must let him know what their impressions are so that he can

disabuse them. But I do not think that they need quote chapter and

verse against him as if they were dismissing him from an office

(Ridge v. Baldwin 1964 AC 40), or depriving him of his property,

as in Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works (1863 14 CB (NS)

180). After all, they are not charging him with doing anything

wrong. They are simply inquiring as to his capability and diligence

and are having regard to his character, reputation and financial

standing. They are there to protect the public interest, to see that

persons running the gaming clubs are fit to be trusted.

14. The petitioner's substantive grievance is the denial of an opportunity to

explain orally, so to say. Yet, the relevant matters were disclosed by the

petitioner himself, and the Incorporated Council of Legal Education had

before it the relevant order and indictment when making its decision.

The Incorporated Council of Legal Education was not inquiring into any

dispute nor making any adjudication or any competing or contentions

between parties. It was deciding on the acceptance of an application.

When all the relevant material is before such body, there is nothing else

WRT/0734/24

Page 10 of 12

that is required. In such circumstances, the failure to afford an

additional oral hearing does not cause any prejudice or amount to any

procedural unfairness. It is so, when the relevant material was in fact

before the deciding authority. To my mind, the requirement of affording

a hearing is no more than to give an opportunity to place the position

and relevant matters by such person who may be affected by such

decision. In the current context, the relevant issue is the fact of the

petitioner promptly making amends and exhibiting remorse and the fact

that he has now reformed himself. The petitioner, in his written

submissions, has adverted to several Indian authorities, where attorneys

disbarred or disenrolled on disciplinary grounds in view of criminal acts

or convictions have been reconsidered to be restored. Accordingly, it is

submitted that the petitioner himself, after the lapse of several years of

the alleged incident, has now demonstrably reformed himself. As

narrated above, these facts were placed before the Incorporated Council

of Legal Education. When considering the nature of the offending act,

which is in the form of pre-determined and calculated utterances, as

opposed to a hot-blooded act in the spur of the moment, it does

demonstrate a certain inherent propensity of the petitioner and also of

a pre-planned act.

15. The learned High Court Judge has purported to pronounce that the

sentence will not affect the petitioners law degree or his functioning as

an Attorney-at-Law in the future. This is based primarily on the premise

of Section 303 of the Criminal Procedure Code. No doubt, this provision

does provide that a sentence that which is suspended will not affect the

employment or retirement benefits of such person. However, considering

the nature of being a member of the legal profession and the

considerations, the fact of being charged for a serious criminal offence

and pleading guilty thereto, or a conviction, to my mind, is necessarily

relevant, notwithstanding as to what sentence has been imposed. The

provisions of Section 303 would not have a direct bearing on the decision

as to the suitability and entitlement of such person to enter into the legal

WRT/0734/24

Page 11 of 12

profession or enrolment as an Attorney-at-Law. It is the gravity, nature,

and act alleged and admitted or proved that is of paramount relevance.

16. Admission to the Sri Lanka Law College as stated above, is the

commencement of the process which finally culminated in seeking

enrolment and admission as an Attorney-at-Law. Admission to the legal

profession stands on a different plane from the admission to any other

profession. In the American context, the right to practice law had been

held to be different and not like the right to engage in the ordinary

business of any other occupation; it is said to be a privilege and a

lawyer is also considered a quasi-public official [In re Gibbs,, 35 Ariz.

346, 278 Pac. 371 (1929), In re Cox, 164 Kan. 160, 188 P.2d 652 (1948)

and In re Thatcher, 190 Fed. 969 (N. D. Ohio 1911)]. Correspondingly,

in the Sri Lankan context too, Attorneys-at-Law are deemed to be

Officers of Court. When the Supreme Court admits and enrols a person

as an Attorney-at-Law, he is held out as being a person of good repute

and of competent knowledge and ability, to whom matters of litigants

and clients of an extremely personal and sensitive nature may be

entrusted with confidence. That is the standard which a person is

expected to possess to be considered for enrolment. In that context, the

decision to disallow the acceptance of the application of the petitioner,

cannot, to my mind, be considered as being irrational and unreasonable

by the Wednesbury standard or otherwise. It is certainly one of the

reasonable inferences or conclusions that may be arrived at on an

objective consideration of the alleged act, even when considered with the

subjective conduct of the petitioner that followed thereafter.

17. In the above context, all relevant materials had been placed before the

Incorporated Council of Legal Education for their consideration.

According to the minutes, it is apparent that upon discussion and

considering this material, the Council has come to this impugned

determination and conclusion. As aforestated, when considered in

conjunction with the subsequent conduct and other matters placed

before this Court, the impugned decision not to accept the application

WRT/0734/24

Page 12 of 12

is certainly not unreasonable. Considering in the context of the end

result being the admission as an Attorney-at-Law, the serious offences,

as depicted in the charges to which the petitioner has pleaded guilty, are

clearly sufficient grounds to lawfully refuse and reject such application.

18. The petitioner has failed to satisfy this court of any lawful ground that

entitles him to the relief as prayed for. Accordingly, I see no basis in law

or otherwise to grant the relief as prayed for by the petitioner.

19. In the above premises, I am left with no option but to refuse and reject

this application. However, I make no order as to costs.
