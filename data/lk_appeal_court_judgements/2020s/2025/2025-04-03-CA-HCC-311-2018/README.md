JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused- Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted

before the High Court of Colombo on the count of grave sexual abuse committed

on one minor namely, Gladwin Roshani punishable under Section 365B (2)(b) of

the Penal Code as amended by Acts Nos. 22 of 1995, 28 of 1998 and 16 of 2006.

The Prosecution led the evidence of 13 witnesses and marked 5 productions. The

Accused gave a dock statement and called one witness in defence. At the

conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge by judgment dated

31.07.2018 convicted the Accused and sentenced him to 8 years of rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 20,000/- in default 4 months simple imprisonment.

Further a compensation of Rs. 50,000 was imposed to be paid to the victim in

default 10 months of simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the Accused filed an

appeal in this Court.

The grounds of appeal as pleaded by the Accused as follows;

1. Failure to mention a specific date on the indictment.

2. Failure of the Learned High Court Judge to recognize inter se and per se

contradictions of the prosecutions case.

3. PW1 is not a credible witness.

4. Learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself in stating that the

evidence of the Prosecutrix is corroborated by her statement given to the

JMO.

At the hearing, the Counsel for the Accused brought to notice that the Learned

High Court Judge had failed to consider the document marked as P4 by the

prosecution. According to the said document, the prosecutrix has failed to indicate

any incident between herself and the accused but simply mentions earlier

incidents.

For easy reference, letter marked P4 is reproduced below:

Page 4 of 13

According to the prosecutrix, on the day in question, she visited the Accuseds sons

house to give some grapes to the little kid there. In the meantime, when they were

watching TV, the Accuseds daughter-in-law, the mother of the children went out.

While they were watching TV, sitting on the bed with the child, the Accused came

and sat near her. He took the child from the victims lap. Later, he raised her dress

and inserted his fingers into her vagina.

This had happened for about 20 minutes and he had stopped it when the Accuseds

daughter-in-law came. After seeing her, he had taken the hand out.

According to her, the Accused had given her Rs.100 to her not to tell this incident

to anyone. After going home, she did not tell anyone about the incident because of

fear.

Thereafter, on the next day she went to school and told this incident to one of her

friends, Rasangika. This friend of the victim namely Rasangika was listed as a

witness in the indictment, but not called to give evidence. According to the victim,

she was sure that she had divulged this incident to her friend the very next day.

According to her, Rasangika had told the incident to the teachers and the teachers

had asked her as to what happened. Thereafter, child protection authorities had

directed her to a doctor and the victim had told the incident to the doctor.

In cross-examination, she affirmed that she had told the incident to her friend.

Further, it was suggested that the mother of the child was inside the kitchen.

Page 6 of 13

Later, she was summoned by the Court to identify the document marked P4 which

was mentioned by PW9. According to PW1, she identified the document marked

P4. She stated that she had referred to the incident in the said letter which was

marked by the defence as V6 (a) and (b).

According to PW4, the Principal of the school, the prosecutrix gave a letter to them

on 23.11.2010 through her friend which is marked as P4. According to her, one

uncle and two boys had abused the prosecutrix.

The question that arises here is why she has failed to indicate the specific incident

which happened two days prior to writing the said letter. In the said letter she

mentioned the incidents which had happened some time ago and mentioned people

who had been involved and simply mentioned about an uncle. According to

evidence given by the witnesses, teachers had seen the prosecutrix and her friend

inside a washroom. Thereafter, when they questioned her, she revealed what

happened to her and they asked her to put it into writing.

The Learned High Court Judge has not considered the failure of the prosecutrix

to indicate the incident in the letter which happened two days prior. A prudent

man will disclose all the details that happened in the recent past with detail.

According to her, this letter was given two days after the incident happened. The

question before us is why she has failed to disclose the incident in the said letter

where she has mentioned other people and not a single word about the Accused.

There is no other evidence to corroborate her version of the story. It is true that

there is no need for corroboration to prove this type of offences. But our Courts

expect the evidence of the prosecution to be strong and consistent. In other words,

Page 7 of 13

if the evidence of the victim could be relied on, and is trustworthy and firm, then

there is no hindrance for the Court to act solely on the evidence of the victim. On

the other hand, when the Court comes to the conclusion that if such evidence is

not convincing, the Court should look for corroboration to believe her story.

The question arises whether the Court can believe the story of the Prosecutrix in

view of the said letter.

I would like to quote a passage from Glanville Williams, The Proof of Guilt, Third

Edition, page 158 in relation to uncorroborated evidence of a witness.

The Rule For Corroboration In Sexual Cases

On a charge of rape and similar offences it is the practice to instruct the

jury that it is unsafe to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the alleged

victim, The rule applies to a charge of indecent assault, or any sexual

offence, including an unnatural offence between males.?" There is a sound

reason for it, because these Cases are particularly subject to the danger of

deliberately false charges, resulting from sexual neurosis, phantasy,

jealousy, spite or simply a girl's refusal to admit that she consented to an

act of which she is now ashamed. Of these various possibilities, the most

subtle are those connected with mental complexes. Wigmore, who recites a

number of instances where women have brought false sexual charges

against men, explains one of the motivations as follows:

"The unchaste (let us call it) mentality finds incidental but direct expression

in the narration of imaginary sex incidents of which the narrator is the

Page 8 of 13

heroine or the victim. On the surface the narration is straightforward and

convincing. The real victim, however, too often in such cases is the innocent

man; for the respect and sympathy naturally felt by any tribunal for a

wronged female helps to give easy credit to such a plausible tale."

In general, the requirement of corroboration in sexual cases follows the

same rules as for accomplice evidence, though there are one or two

differences of detail. Comparing the two corroboration rules, the Court of

Criminal Appeal on one occasion suggested that the argument for requiring

corroboration in the case of sexual complain- ants was weaker than in the

case of accomplices. " This court cannot accept the contention that the

evidence of a girl, the victim of the offence, is on the same plane with that

of the evidence of an accomplice. The objection in such a case as this is not

on the grounds of complicity, but because the case is one of an oath against

an oath." Surely the reason for the objection is stronger than this. There is

no general requirement that the jury should be warned that it is dangerous

to convict where the evidence is in a position of oath against oath. The

distinctive reason for the warning in sexual cases is that experience shows

that the complainant's evidence may be warped by psychological processes

which are not evident to the eye of common sense. The danger of convicting

on the evidence of an accomplice who is trying to minimize his own part in

the affair is obvious even to an unintelligent person; in ordinary cases, a

word from the defendant's counsel is enough to bring it to the attention of

the jury as a matter for serious consideration. In sexual cases, on the other

hand, the danger is usually not obvious. Moreover, there is a tendency in

Page 9 of 13

sexual cases for the proceedings to start with a prejudice against the

defendant, if the complainant is a girl of tender years, whose appearance

makes a strong appeal to the sympathy and protective feelings of the jury.

The above passage was referred by Sisira De Abrew, J. in CA/129/2002, decided

on 28.06.2007, Appellate Court Judgments (Unreported) 2007 Volume I, and held

that

Court can, however act on uncorroborated testimony of a prosecutrix if her

evidence appears to the Court to be completely, satisfactory and there are

attending circumstances which make it safe for the Court to act upon her

evidence without corroboration. If I may put it in another way that is if her

evidence is capable of convincing the Court that she is speaking the truth,

Court can act on such testimony without corroboration. In this regard, I am

guided by the judgment of Justice Alles with whom Justice Weeramanthry

and Justice Thamodaram agreed in Premasiri vs. Queen 77 NLR page 86.

Justice Alles stated thus: In a charge of rape it is proper for a jury to convict

on an uncorroborated evidence of the complainant only when such evidence

is of such character as to convince the jury that she is speaking the truth.

In Dingiribandage Sumanadasa v. The Republic of Sri Lanka, CA No147/2005,

Decided on 18.07.2008, Sisira de Abrew, J. Appellate Court

Judgment(Unreported) 2008 (Volume II) Cri.

I hold that the medical evidence does not support the evidence of the

prosecutrix. Thus the case depends only on the evidence of the prosecutrix.

Can an accused person in a case of rape be convicted on uncorroborated

Page 10 of 13

evidence of the victim? In this connection I would like to consider certain

judicial decisions.

In Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai Vs. State of Gujarat (2983) AIR S.C. 753 Indian

Supreme Court stated thus:-

"In the Indian setting, refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of

sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding

insult to injury".

However, in Gurcharan Singh vs. State of Haryana AIR 1972 S.C. 2661 the

Indian Supreme Court held thus;

" As a rule of prudence, however, court normally looks jor some

corroboration on her testimony so as to satisfy its conscience that she

is telling the truth and that the person accused of rape on her has not

been falsely implicated".

In King vs. Athukorale 50 NLR 256 Justice Gratiaen states thus:-

"Where an accused is charged with rape, corroboration of the story of

the prosecutrix must come from some independent quarter and not

from the prosecutrix herself. A complaint made by the prosecutrix to

the Police in which she implicated the accused cannot be regarded as

corroboration of her evidence".

In the instant case, we hold that the testimony of the prosecutrix is not consistent

and reliable in view of the letter marked P4, where she had failed to disclose the

incident that happened two days ago. According to P4, she has referred to a

Page 11 of 13

different incident which was not corroborating with the incident that she testified

in the High Court.

We further observe that the place where the incident allegedly happened creates

a doubt on the probability, the reason being that the Accused knew that the mother

of the children would come there anytime, as one of the children was an infant.

According to the Prosecutrix, the Accused continued the act for about 20 minutes.

The question is, would a mother leave an infant unattended for such a long time.

This creates a doubt as to whether the incident actually happened as alleged by

the prosecutrix.

Probability is an essential element in convincing the Judge as to the incident

actually happened and the more the probability of the assumptions more will be

chances for the judge to get convinced.

In the instant case, the entire case revolves around and rests on the testimony of

the victim of the case namely Gladwin Roshani. It is true that the conviction can

be based on the testimony of a single witness, provided that her evidence can be

believed.

However, the trial Judge failed to consider the document marked P4 when he

reached the conclusion about the prosecution witness.

An excprt of the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge is repsrduced below;

page 249

As a rule of prudence, it has been emphasized that courts should normally look for

some corroboration of the victims testimony in order to satisfy itself that the

prosecutrix is telling the truth. Further, the advisability of corroboration should

be present in the mind of the Judge and there should be an indication of such in

the judgment. Nevertheless, convicting the Accused on the evidence of the

prosecutrix without corroboration is admissible, provided such evidence is

consistent and probable.

We are of the view that in the instant case, the evidence of the prosecutrix is not

convincing enough to convict the Accused as she does not satisfy the tests of

consistency and probability. On perusal and consideration of the Learned Trial

Judges judgment and the evidence placed before him, we are of the view that he

has misdirected himself with regard to PW1. The evidence led by the Prosecution

is not satisfactory and convincing to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. It is

my considered opinion that the testimony of the victim being uncorroborated by

Page 13 of 13

other evidence fails the prosecution case for not proving the case beyond

reasonable doubt.

Thus, we set aside the conviction and the sentence.

Appeal allowed.
