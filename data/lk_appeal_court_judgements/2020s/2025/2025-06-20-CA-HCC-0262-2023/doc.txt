JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) has

been indicted in the High Court of Hambantota in High Court case no.

HC 01/2022.

2. The charge in the indictment is as follows;

That on or about December 26, 2018, in the District of

Hambantota within the jurisdiction of this Court the

appellant did stab Thena Hannadige Nadeeka Lakmali with

such intention or knowledge and under such circumstances

that had he by such an act caused the death of the said

Thena Hannadige Nadeeka, he would have been guilty of

murder, and that he by such an act caused hurt to the said

Page 3 of 8

Thena Hannadige Nadeeka Lakmali; and that he has thereby

committed an offence punishable under section 300 of the

Penal Code.

3. At the conclusion of the trial the appellant has been convicted of the

charge referred to above and sentenced to a term of 13 years rigorous

imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs.10,000.00 with a term of 01

year rigorous imprisonment in default of payment of the fine.

4. Being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentencing order, the

appellant has preferred the instant appeal to this Court.

Case of the prosecution

5. On the date of the incident, December 26, 2018, at approximately 05.00

pm the neighbours of the appellant have heard the commotion coming

from his house and subsequently alerted the police. Officers have

arrived at the appellants residence, where two female officers have

conducted an inquiry, they had been informed that there had been a

verbal dispute between the appellant and his wife, but the couple has

indicated that they would resolve the matter among themselves. After,

assessing the situation, the female officers have returned to their patrol

vehicle. Shortly thereafter, an officer has witnessed the appellants wife

running towards their vehicle, with the appellant in pursuit. The officer

has also witnessed the appellant physically assaulting his wife, causing

Page 4 of 8

her to fall near the patrol vehicle. It has been evident that the appellant

was armed with a knife during this altercation. As a result of the attack,

the wife of the appellant has sustained a bleeding injury and has been

subsequently admitted to a hospital. The appellant has been arrested

and taken into police custody. On January 01, 2019, Dr. H C W

Ajithkumar MO/Medico-Legal Officer has examined the wife of the

appellant during her stay at the hospital and subsequently prepared a

medico-legal report. This report has been designated as exhibit -04.

Case of the appellant

6. The appellant has asserted that he has been falsely implicated in this

case and has insisted that he has committed no offence.

7. When the matter was taken up for argument, the Learned Presidents

Counsel for the appellant has urged the following grounds of appeal;

i. There has been total inadequacy in the consideration of

the facts of the case by the Learned Trial Judge.

ii. The nature of the injury has not been adequately

considered by the Learned Trial Judge.

iii. The nature of the weapon has been completely

misunderstood by the Learned Trial Judge.

iv. Ingredients of the offence of attempted murder have not

been adequately considered by the Learned Trial Judge.

Page 5 of 8

v. Without prejudice to the above, even if the totality of the

evidence is accepted the appellant can be convicted of only

simple hurt.

vi. The appellant has had no fair trial in lieu of one or more

of the above mention matters.

8. Section 300 of the Penal Code addresses the offence of attempted

murder, which is a serious criminal act characterized by the deliberate

intention to kill another individual.

9. Section 300 of the Penal Code provides as follows,

Whoever does any act with such intention or knowledge and

under such circumstances that if he by that act caused death

he would be guilty of murder, shall be punished with

imprisonment of either description for a term which may

extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; and if hurt

is caused to any person by such act, the offender shall be

liable to imprisonment of either description for a term which

may extend to twenty years and shall also be liable to a fine.

10. To constitute an attempt to murder under section 300 of the penal code,

the prosecution must establish certain key elements.

a. The death of a human being must be attempted.

b. The accused/appellant must have made the attempt.

Page 6 of 8

c. The act must be done with the intention of causing death or

it be done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as

i. the accused/appellant knew to be likely to cause

death, or,

ii. that it was sufficient in the ordinary course of

nature to cause death.

d. The accused/appellant attempted to cause such death by

doing an act known to him to be so imminently dangerous

that it must in all probability cause

i. death, or,

ii. such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.

11. When the police officers visited the residence of the appellant, no

complaint has been made regarding any attempt by the appellant to

cause injury to his wife. Additionally, there have been no allegations, of

threats or statements related to an attempt made on his wifes life. There

is also no evidence to support the claim that the neighbours heard any

threats made by the appellant towards his wife.

12. Further medical evidence has not been presented at the trial and no

justification provided for this absence. The medico-legal report pertaining

to the appellants wife has been submitted by a court officer. This report

indicates that the appellants wife sustained a single injury to her back,

Page 7 of 8

which the attending physician i.e. PW11 has classified as a non-grievous

injury.

13. Despite the reports description of the injury as a stab wound, it is also

referred to as a cut injury leading to a discrepancy that has not been

clarified. Moreover, there has been no explanation regarding the

sensitivity of the body area where the injury was inflicted.

14. When discussing the potential injuries which could have occurred to a

patients internal organs, it is essential to consider the trauma and the

mechanisms involved. Internal organs are particularly vulnerable to

damage from physical impacts, accidents or medical conditions. For

instance, penetrating injuries, such as those caused by sharp objects

can result in piercing of organs leading to severe complications such as

peritonitis or sepsis. Internal bleeding can compromise a patients

hemodynamic stability necessitating medical intervention. Such

evidence has also not been forthcoming either.

15. In these circumstances, there is no evidence to establish that an

attempt was made to cause the death of his wife by the appellant.

16. Furthermore, it cannot be conclusively shown that the appellant in

making this attempt inflicted the injury with the intention to cause death

or with the awareness that such injury was likely to result in death or

that it was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.

17. The evidence does not also demonstrate that the appellant attempted

to cause his wifes death through any actions that he knew to be

imminently dangerous, actions which were likely to result in her death

or to inflict injury that could have led to her death.

18. Based on the reasons outlined above, I overturn the appellants

conviction of attempted murder together with the disputed sentencing

order.

Instead, I find the appellant guilty of voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon an offence punishable under the provisions of section 315 of the Penal Code and convict the appellant of such offence. I hereby sentence the appellant to three years rigorous imprisonment and impose a fine of Rs. 10,000.00. Should the appellant fail to pay the fine, an additional term of 6 months simple imprisonment shall be enforced. The term of rigorous imprisonment shall commence from June 20,2025.

19. Subject to the above variation, the appeal is dismissed.

I make no order regarding cost.

20. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this judgment to

the High Court of Hambantota for compliance.
