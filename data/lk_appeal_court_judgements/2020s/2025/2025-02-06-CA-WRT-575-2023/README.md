Before: S. U. B. Karalliyadde, J.

Mayadunne Corea, J.

Counsel: P. K. Prince Perera for the Petitioner.

Chathura Galhena for the 1st Respondent.

Maithree Amarasinhge, SSC for the 37th, 38th and 39th Respondents.

Written submissions tendered on:

12.09.2024 by the Petitioner

26.09.2024 by the 1st Respondent

Argued on: 28.08.2024

Decided on: 06.02.2025

S. U. B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner is a registered medical practitioner of the Sri Lanka Medical Council

(the 1st Respondent). A complaint was received by the 1st Respondent against the

Petitioner by an affidavit dated 18.10.2019 marked as P8(1) alleging that the

Petitioner is issuing medical certificates in the capacity of a Consultant Radiologist

and used a seal to that effect while the Petitioner was not a Consultant Radiologist.

The Ministry of Health, by the letter dated 10.09.2021 marked as P9 called for

explanations from the Petitioner regarding the alleged incident and thereafter the

Secretary to the Ministry of Health by the letter dated 28.10.2021 marked as P11

issued a warning to the Petitioner. After a preliminary inquiry has been held, the

Preliminary Proceedings Committee of the 1st Respondent, by the report dated

10.03.2022 marked as 1R1 made recommendations to the Professional Conduct

Committee (PCC) that there is a prima facie case against the Petitioner. Therefore the

PPC had decided to hold a formal disciplinary inquiry on the alleged complaint. The

7

1st Respondent by letter dated 04.11.2022 marked as P14 informed the Petitioner that

an Inquiry is going to be held against the Petitioner on 17.12.2022 by the PCC on the

charges stated in the Notice of Inquiry dated 04.11.2022 marked as P15 including the

charges, inter-alia, that the Petitioner has issued medical certificates without having

full qualifications to be a Consultant Radiologist, issued medical certificates without

obtaining the board certificate to function as a Consultant Radiologist from the Post

Graduate Institute of Medicine, used a rubber stamp to introduce himself as a

Consultant Radiologist and acting as a Consultant Radiologist and having a private

channelling practice while not being a board-certified Consultant Radiologist.

The Petitioner states that to be qualified as a Consultant Radiologist in Sri Lanka one

must complete one year of local and another year of foreign training. Having

completed one year of local training, the Petitioner has been offered employment in a

Singapore Hospital to complete the one year of foreign training. The Petitioner states

that to practice medicine in Singapore, he needs a certificate of good standing and

therefore, he has requested a certificate of good standing from the 1st Respondent.

However, that request was denied by the 1st Respondent, because the inquiry against

the Petitioner was pending at the time the request for a certificate of good standing

was made. To expedite the PPC Inquiry and obtain the certificate of good standing

expeditiously, the Petitioner filed a Writ application (CA Writ 204/2023) before this

Court. However, the Petitioner later withdrew that Writ application as the 1st

Respondent informed him that the inquiry is expected to be held on 15.07.2023.

The first session of the PCC inquiry was held on 15.07.2023 (P20) where the charge

sheet was read over to the Petitioner and he had pleaded not guilty to the charges

against him. Thereafter the evidence of the prosecution was led and the complainant

8

was cross-examined. Thereafter, evidence of the defence was due to be led on the

second session of the inquiry which was held on 29.07.2023 (P21). On that date, the

Attorney at law appearing for the Petitioner had withdrawn the earlier plea of not

guilty and pleaded guilty to the charges to obtain the certificate of good standing

without further delay. Thereafter the Registrar of the 1st Respondent, by letter dated

03.08.2023 marked P22 requested the Petitioner to submit an affidavit stating the

Petitioners position to withdraw the plea of guilty to regulate the procedure as PCC

has concluded the Inquiry and the order was fixed to be delivered on 12.08.2023.

To comply with that request, the Petitioner had submitted his affidavit dated

11.08.2023 marked as P23. On the third session held on 12.08.2023 (P24), the said

affidavit marked as P23 has been rejected by the PCC for the reason that P23 is

contradictory to the facts presented by the Attorney at law appearing for the Petitioner

at the second session of the Inquiry and therefore the Petitioner has been directed to

file a new affidavit. Accordingly, the Petitioner has submitted the affidavit dated

16.08.2023 marked as P25. The Registrar of the 1st Respondent by letter dated

11.09.2023 marked as P26 informed the Petitioner that by the Sentencing Order dated

09.09.2023 marked as P27, the PCC has decided to suspend him from exercising his

rights, privileges and immunities conferred upon him by registration as a Medical

Practitioner for a period of one year and to reduce the sentence imposed on the

Petitioner for a period of six months commencing from 09.09.2023 in terms of the

Medical Disciplinary (Procedure) Regulations 1990 (the Regulations) published in the

Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 757/7 marked as P30 and the Medical

Ordinance No. 26 of 1927 as amended.

9

Being aggrieved by the said Sentencing Order marked as P27, the Petitioner

exercising the right to appeal under Section 18(1) of the Medical Ordinance has

preferred an appeal dated 12.09.2023 marked as P28(1) to the Minister of Heath, to

which the Petitioner has not received a reply as to the date. Being aggrieved by the

Sentencing Order marked as P27 the Petitioner filed the instant Application seeking

the following substantive reliefs, inter alia,

(b) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari against 1st - 37th

Respondents to quash the

(i) proceedings of the Professional Conduct Committee

(ii) PCC decided further to reduce the punishment of suspension imposed

on the Accused Petitioner from the period of 01 year to a period of 06

months from exercising his rights privileges and immunities conferred

upon him by registration as a Medical Practitioner

The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argued that the entire inquiry

proceedings and the Sentencing Order marked as P27 is ultra vires, erroneous in law

on the face of the record, in violation of natural justice, void ab initio and in

contravention to the provisions of Regulations marked as P30 on the following three

grounds,

1. In terms of the Second Schedule to the Regulation marked as P30, the PCC

should consist of 11 members, whereas the Inquiry on the Petitioner was

conducted before 7 members only.

2. On the third session (held on 12.08.2023) Dr D. S. Samaraweera was not

present still, he was present before the fourth session and the Judicial

10

Accessor, Hon. Justice Chandra Ekanayake was not present before the fourth

session which was contrary to Regulations 6, 7(1) and 7(2) of the Second

Schedule to the Regulations marked as P30.

3. The Sentencing Order communicated by the Registrar of the 1st Respondent

marked as P26 is a decision of the PCC and not a 1st Respondents and

therefore, it is contrary to Regulations 20 and 21 of the Regulations marked as

P30.

Now I will address the aforesaid grounds separately. Firstly, the learned Counsel

appearing for the Petitioner argued that the PCC should consist of 11 members in

terms of Clauses 1 and 3 of the Second Schedule of the Regulations marked as P30.

However, in contravention to that Clause, at the Inquiry held against the Petitioner in

the Application at hand only 7 members i.e. 2nd, 9th, 15th, 19th, 22nd, 26th and 29th

Respondents have participated in the inquiry proceedings held against the Petitioner.

Therefore, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner argues that due to the non-

constitution of the quorum of the PCC, the entire inquiry proceeding and the

Sentencing Order is ultra vires, erroneous in law on the face of the record, and

violates the principles of natural justice and the legitimate expectation of the

Petitioner.

However, the learned Counsel appearing for the 1st Respondent argued that, in terms

of Clause 3 of the second schedule of the Sinhala version of Regulations (marked as

1R8), the Chairman and four other members should participate at the inquiries held by

the PCC to formulate the quorum. In the instant matter, all the proceedings held

against the Petitioner were conducted with the participation of the 2nd Respondent, the

Chairman of the PCC and the 9th, 15th, 19th, 22nd and 29th Respondents and, therefore

11

there is no violation of the Regulations. In terms of Regulation 11, the provisions set

out in the second schedule to the Regulations apply in relation to the constitution and

the procedure to be followed at the meetings of the PCC. Clauses 1 and 3 of the

second schedule of the Regulations marked as P30 are as follows,

(1) The Professional Conduct Committee shall consist of the person who, for the

time being, is the President of the Council and ten other members of the

Council elected at a meeting of the Council by secret ballot, from among the

members of the Council who are not members of the Committee. The Registrar

shall give at least ten days prior notice of such meeting to every such member

of the Council.

(3) The President and members of the Professional Conduct Committee shall

constitute a quorum at any meeting of the Professional Conduct Committee.

Sinhalese version of Clause 3 reads thus,

4 .

When examining both Sinhalese and English versions of the Regulations, there is a

clear inconsistency in Clause 3 between the two versions. The learned Counsel

appearing for the 1st Respondent submitted to this Court that as the Sinhalese version

of the Regulations prevails over the English version, the requirement of the

consistency of the quorum of the PCC has been satisfied in terms of Clause 3 of the

Regulations and therefore there is no violation of the Regulations. However, it was

the argument of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner that the Sinhala

version does not prevail as there is no mention of a clause in the Regulations where it

12

states that in case of any inconsistency, the Sinhala version should prevail. The

language of the legislation is governed under Article 23 of the Constitution. Article 23

(2), reads as follows,

All Orders. Proclamations, rules, by-laws, regulations and notifications made

or issued under any written law other than by a Provincial Council or a local

authority, and the Gazette shall be published in Sinhala and Tamil together

with a translation thereof in English.

Under Section 72 of the Medical Ordinance, the Minister of Health has been given the

power to make regulations under the Medical Ordinance and the Regulations marked

as P30 and 1R8 have come into force by execution of such powers vested with the

Minister under Section 72 of the Medical Ordinance. It is evident from Article 23 that

when regulations are made under any written law, they should be published in Sinhala

and Tamil languages along with a translation in English. In terms of Article 18(1), the

official language of Sri Lanka is Sinhala. Therefore, it is clear that in terms of Article

23 of the Constitution, the Sinhala version of the Regulations (1R8) prevails over the

English version of the Regulations (P30) which is a translation of such regulation. In

the case of Attorney General v. Ayiduroos Abdul Rahim and Others1, where there was

an inconsistency in the English and the Sinhala version of Regulation 6 published

under the Gazette Notification, bearing No.147/24 issued under the Public Security

Ordinance, Aluwihare PC. J., observed that,

It is contended on behalf of the Appellants that in the event of an inconsistency

between the texts of a statute or any other law, that it is the Sinhala text that

would prevail and this court is inclined to accept the said argument. The learned

1 SC Appeal No. 67/2011, SC Minutes of 16.02.2015.

13

Senior State Counsel who represented the Attorney General also subscribed to

the views expressed on behalf of the appellants.

Therefore, taking into consideration the Sinhala version of Clause 3 of the Regulation

and the fact that the 2nd, 9th, 15th, 19th, 22nd and 29th Respondents had been present at

the Inquiry proceedings, this Court is of the view that, there is no violation of Clause

3 of the Regulation.

Secondly, the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argues that on the third

session which was held on 12.08.2023, Dr D. S. Samaraweera, the 26th Respondent

was not present but he was present before the first two sessions and the fourth session.

Moreover, the Judicial Accessor, Hon. Justice Chandra Ekanayake was not present

before the fourth session. Therefore, the argument of the learned Counsel appearing

for the Petitioner is that the Inquiry proceedings were conducted in contravention of

Clause 6, 7(1) and 7(2) of the Second Schedule to the Regulations marked as P30.

Hence the Inquiry proceedings are void ab initio and the Sentencing Order marked

P27 is ultra vires and erroneous in law on the face of the record. Clause 6, 7(1) and

7(2) of the second schedule to the Regulations reads thus,

(6) Every member of the Professional Conduct Committee shall attend every

meeting thereof and the absence of any member from any meeting. shall be a

bar to such member from participating in any proceedings connected with the

inquiry being held by the Professional Conduct Committee.

(7) (1) If the attendance of the members at any meeting of the Professional

Conduct Committee falls below the quorum referred to in paragraph (3)

above, such meeting shall be postponed for a further date.

14

(2) If for any reason the number of members eligible to participate at any

inquiry falls below the quorum referred to in paragraph (3) above, a fresh

Committee shall be constituted and the inquiry shall commence from the

beginning before the Committee so constituted.

The contention of the learned Counsel appearing for the 1st Respondent is that even

though the 26th Respondent did not participate in the third session of the Inquiry, his

absence does not have any impact on the validity of the proceedings that took place in

the third session and the entire inquiry proceedings as the members present at the third

session satisfy the quorum of members required by Clause 3 of the Regulations. The

learned Counsel further argued that the Judicial Accessor is not a member of the PCC

and does not constitute a part of the PCC and therefore the absence of the Judicial

Accessor does not have any impact on the inquiry proceedings.

It is evident from the letter dated 03.08.2023 marked as P22 that the PCC had

concluded the Inquiry and the order of the PCC was fixed to be delivered on

12.08.2023 and therefore the Registrar of the 1st Respondent has asked the Petitioner

to submit an affidavit stating his position indicating the intention of the Petitioner to

withdraw his previous plea of not guilty. However, as the Petitioner had submitted an

affidavit affirming facts inconsistent with the facts presented by his Counsel in the

second session, the PCC has directed the Petitioner to file a fresh affidavit on that

matter in the third session held on 12.08.2023. Even though the 26th Respondent did

not participate in the third session, he has signed the sentencing order. However, the

inquiry has been duly concluded in the second session and even though there were

three sessions, in the third session the Petitioner has only been directed to hand over a

fresh affidavit. Therefore, it is the view of this Court that no prejudice has been

15

caused to the Petitioner and there is no violation of Clause 7(1) and 7(2) as the

required quorum of members has been satisfied in the first two sessions.

The third argument of the Petitioner is that the Sentencing Order communicated by

the Registrar of the 1st Respondent marked as P26 is a decision of the PCC and not a

decision of the 1st Respondent which is contrary to Regulations 20 and 21 of the

Regulations marked as P30. The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argued

that at the time the Sentencing Order was communicated to the Petitioner by way of a

letter marked as P26, the said Order was not approved by the 1st Respondent and to

enforce the Sentencing Order the PCC should submit it to the 1st Respondent and get

the approval. The Sentencing Order was communicated to the Petitioner on

11.09.2023 (P26) and it was approved by the 1st Respondent at its meeting held on

22.09.2023 (1R6). Therefore, this is contrary to Regulations 20 and 21 of the

Regulations marked as P30. The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner further

argued that enforcing the decision of the PCC without the approval of the 1st

Respondent is a procedural impropriety. In the case of Council of Civil Service

Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service2 Lord Diplock described procedural

impropriety as one of the grounds for judicial review as follows;

I have described the third head as procedural impropriety rather than

failure to observe basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with procedural

fairness towards the person who will be affected by the decision. This is because

susceptibility to judicial review under this head covers also failure by an

administrative tribunal to observe procedural rules that are expressly laid down

2 [1985] AC 374.

16

in the legislative instrument by which its jurisdiction is conferred, even where

such failure does not involve any denial of natural justice

The position of the learned Counsel appearing for the 1st Respondent regarding the

enforcement of the Sentencing Order is that even though the Registrar of the 1st

Respondent has taken steps to inform the decision of the PCC to the Ministry of

Health by the letter marked as P26 without the approval of the 1st Respondent, the

decision of the PCC has been submitted for approval to the 1st Respondent by way of

a memorandum dated 13.09.2023 marked as 1R5. Thereafter, the Sentencing Order of

the PCC has been approved by the 1st Respondent in its meeting held on 22.09.2023

as evident from the Minutes of the said meeting tabled at the following meeting held

on 27.10.2023 marked as 1R7.

The Regulations 20 and 21 of the Regulations marked as P30 reads thus,

20. If the Professional Conduct Committee determines that its decision should not

be postponed, the Chairman shall announce its decision forthwith in such

manner as the Professional Conduct Committee may think fit.

21. The Professional Conduct Committee shall thereafter inform the Council, of

its decision. On receipt of such decision the Council shall direct the Registrar

to take such steps as may be necessary to give effect to that decision

In terms of Regulation 20 of the Regulations marked as P30, it can be observed that

once the PCC comes to a determination the Chairman of the PCC will announce the

decision of the PCC and thereafter in terms of Regulation 21, the PCC shall inform its

decision to the 1st Respondent and on receipt of such decision, the 1st Respondent

shall direct the Registrar to take necessary steps to enforce such order. In terms of

17

Regulation 21, the PCC is required to inform its decision of the 1st Respondent and

not to get the approval of the 1st Respondent. Therefore, this Court is not in agreement

with the argument of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner that the

approval of the PCC is required prior to enforcement of the Sentencing Order of the

PCC. In terms of Regulation 21 the 1st Respondent will only give directions to the

Registrar to take steps to give effect to the order. Therefore, this Court sees no merit

in the argument of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner that there is a

procedural impropriety in the matter at hand.

The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner further argued that the members of

the PCC forced the Petitioner to plead guilty and he was not allowed to present his

defence. Therefore, the decision of the PCC is arbitrary. However, the argument of

the learned Counsel appearing for the 1st Respondent is that the Petitioner was

represented by his Attorney at law at the inquiry, and the Attorney at law has

informed the PCC of the Petitioners intention to withdraw the plea of guilt.

Moreover, the PCC has informed the Petitioner that a sentence would be imposed and

a certificate of good standing could not be issued when such a sentence is in

operation. It is evident from the inquiry proceedings of the second session dated

29.07.2023 marked as P21, that it is indeed the Attorney at law for the Petitioner that

informed the PCC that the Petitioner instructed him to withdraw the earlier plea of not

guilty and plead guilty for the charges framed against the Petitioner. Therefore, this

Court cannot agree with the contention of the Petitioner that he was forced to plead

guilty.

Moreover, the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argued that there is no

schedule of offence and penal sections in the Medical Ordinance and in terms of

18

Section 25(1) of the Medical Ordinance the 1st Respondent is vested with discretion

and it is not absolute and unfretted and it should be reasonable. However, the PCC has

not exercised such discretion reasonably and therefore the decision of the PCC to

suspend the Petitioner for 6 months is unreasonable. The submission of the learned

Counsel for the 1st Respondent is that as per Regulation 19 of the Regulations marked

as P30, the PCC is empowered to decide as it thinks fit and the Regulations have been

in existence for over 30 years enabling the PCC which consist of senior medical

practitioners to determine the nature of every act of misconduct and determine

accordingly. Furthermore, PCC takes into consideration the patients safety and well-

being of the health sector. However, PCC has imposed a lenient sentence on the

Petitioner in order not to deprive him of any prospects while considering the

seriousness of the misconduct committed by the Petitioner. Regulation 19 of the

Regulations marked as P30 reads as follows,

After the practitioner has been afforded an opportunity of addressing the

Professional Conduct Committee and adducing evidence as aforesaid, and if he

avails himself of the opportunity, after the conclusion of his address or evidence

the Professional Conduct Committee shall consider and determine whether to

postpone its decision as to whether action under Section 25 (1) of the Ordinance

should be taken and if the Professional Conduct Committee so determines, the

decision of the Professional Conduct Committee shall stand postponed until such

future meeting of the Professional Conduct Committee as the Professional

Conduct Committee may determine and the Chairman shall announce the

determination of the Professional Conduct Committee in such manner as the

Professional Conduct Committee may think fit.

19

Section 25(1) of the Medical Ordinance reads thus,

The Medical Council may, if it thinks fit-

(a) on any ground authorized by this Ordinance, order that the name of any

person be erased from a register or, in lieu of such erasure, may order

that he be suspended from the rights, privileges, and immunities

conferred upon him by registration during the period specified in the

order;

It is evident from Regulation 19 that after the conclusion of the inquiry, the PCC has

the power to decide to take action under Section 25(1) of the Medical Ordinance.

Therefore, the PCC has the power either to order the name of a practitioner to be

erased from the registry or to suspend him for a period that the PCC think fit. In the

instant Application even though the Petitioner claimed that he pleaded guilty in order

to get the inquiry expedited, in the affidavit marked as P25, the Petitioner himself has

admitted the fact that he has committed such misconduct by mistake. The PCC in its

Sentencing Order marked as P27 had originally sentenced the Petitioner for a period

of one year and thereafter considering the submissions made in mitigation on behalf

of the Petitioner, PCC has reduced the sentence to six months. In Associated

Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v. Wednesbury Corporation3 unreasonableness is

defined as something so absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay

within the powers of the authority. Considering the above facts this Court is of the

view that that PCC has granted a sentence to the Petitioner exercising the power

vested with them in terms of Section 25(1) of the Medical Ordinance.

3 [1948]1 KB 223 at 229.

20

Considering all the above-stated facts this Court is of the view that neither the Inquiry

proceedings nor the Sentencing Order marked as P27 is ultra vires, erroneous in law

on the face of record, in violation of natural justice, void ab initio and in

contravention to the provisions of the Regulations marked as P30. On the above-

mentioned facts and circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner is not

entitled to the Writ of Certiorari as prayed for in the prayer to this Application.

Therefore, the Application is dismissed without costs.

Application dismissed.
