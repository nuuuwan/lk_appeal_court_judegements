JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter after referred as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General before the High Court of

Kegalle under Sections 54(A) (d) and 54(A) (b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for

Possession and Trafficking respectively of 6.143 grams of Heroin on 13th

March, 2018.

After the trial the Appellant was found guilty of both counts and the Learned

High Court Judge of Kegalle has sentenced the Appellant to death on both

counts on 06th of April, 2023.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence.

CA-HCC 0163/2023

On behalf of the Appellant following Grounds of Appeal were raised.

1. The Learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to

consider the variation in quantity of the production which

affects the root of the prosecution case.

2. The version of the prosecution is improbable.

3. The Learned High Court Judge erred in law by compelling the

Appellant to adduce more evidence.

4. The Learned High Court Judge erred in law by rejecting the

defence evidence on wrong premises.

According to PW1, SI/Gamini, attached to Aranayake Police Station on

13.02.2018 received information via PW2, PS/48508 Priyantha regarding

drug trafficking by the Appellant. He had organized the raid with seven police

officers.

Thereafter, they had left the police station around 14:30 hours on four motor

bikes. They had travelled about three kilometres and arrived at a place called

Samagama. There, they had spotted the Appellant who was walking

towards them. Seeing their approach, the Appellant had behaved in a

suspicious manner. When the Appellant had tried to flee, PW1 had caught

the Appellant and had conducted a search on him. Upon the search of his

body, a small parcel was found in the right-side pocket of the Appellants

trouser. and six currency notes each amounting to Rs.5000/- were recovered

by the police from the left-side pocket of his trouser. As the parcel recovered

from the Appellant contained some substance which reacted for Heroin

(Diacetylmorphine) he was arrested under the charge of possession and

trafficking of Heroin.

Thereafter, he was taken to a jewellery shop situated at Dippitiya and the

substance was weighed in front of the Appellant. According to PW1, the

weight of the parcel was 8.400 grams. Thereafter, the Appellant along with

CA-HCC 0163/2023

4 | P a g e

the production were handed over to the reserve police officer PC 3986

Pathmini at the Aranayake Police Station.

The parcel pertaining to the Appellant had been registered under production

No. 348/2018, which was produced to the Mawanella Magistrate Court along

with the Appellant. The production had been retained at the police station

under different reserve duty officers before being taken to the Magistrate

Court in Mawanella. After obtaining a court order, the production had been

handed over to the Government Analyst Department on 29/03/2018.

The prosecution led 05 witnesses excluding the Government Analyst, marked

productions and closed the case. The Government Analyst Report was

admitted under Section 420 of Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Thereafter,

the defence was called and the Appellant made a dock statement and called

a witness.

In his dock statement, the Appellant took up the position that he was never

in possession of any dangerous drugs as claimed by the prosecution.

According to him, his father was arrested first and when he visited the police

station, his father was released and he was taken into custody. In his

contention the drugs were introduced to him by the 1st and 2nd witnesses.

His father gave evidence in support of his defence.

It is essential to consider here the fundamental doctrine that all persons are

presumed innocent until proven guilty and entitled to their freedom unless

and until they are found guilty by a Court of competent jurisdiction. This

principle places the burden of proof on the prosecution to demonstrate,

beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused committed the crime. It

ensures fairness in the legal process and protects individuals from being

unfairly convicted or punished.

CA-HCC 0163/2023

As seen in the landmark case of Woolmington v. DPP [1935] A.C.462. where

Viscount Sankey J held that:

Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is

always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the

prisoners guilt If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there

is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the

prosecution or the prisoner..the prosecution has not made out the case

and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.

In the same vein, Perera, J., in Karunadasa Vs. Officer-in-Charge, Motor

Traffic Division, Police Station Nittambuwa (1987) 1 SLR 155 stated that;

It is an imperative requirement in a criminal case that the prosecution

must be convincing, no matter how weak the defence is, before the Court

is entitled to convict on it. It is necessary to borne in mind that the

general rule is that the burden is on the prosecution, to prove the guilt of

the accused. The prosecution must prove their case apart from any

statement made by the accused or any evidence tendered by him. The

weakness of the defence must not be allowed to bolster up a weak case

for the prosecution. The rule is based on the principle that every man is

presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved, and criminality is

never to be presumed.

In the prosecution of an accused for drug related offences, the prosecution

does not only need to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt but must

also ensure, with cogent evidence that the inward journey of the production

has not been disturbed at the all-material points.

CA-HCC 0163/2023

This was elaborated in Witharana Doli Nona v. The Republic of Sri Lanka

CA/19/99 where it was held that:

It is a recognised principle that in drug related cases the prosecution

must prove the chain relating to the inward journey. The purpose of this

principle is to establish that the productions have not been tampered

with. Prosecution must prove that the productions taken from the

accused appellant was examined by the Government Analyst. To prove

this, the prosecution must prove all the links of the chain from the time

it was taken from the possession of the accused appellant to the

government Analysts Department.

Similarly, in Mahasarukkalige Chandani v. Attorney General

CA/213/2009 decided on 30/06/2016 His Lordship Justice Malalgoda held

that:

As observed above, that Government Analyst Report which is the

principal evidence in a drug offence entirely depends on the inward

journey of the production chain and therefore, there is a duty cast on the

prosecution to establish the inward journey of the production with

reliable evidence.

Further, in the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94

held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although we

take serious view in regard to offences relation to drugs, we are of the view

that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to fill the gaps of

badly handled prosecutions where the identity of the good analysis for

examination has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. A prosecutor

should take pains to ensure that the chain of events pertaining to the

productions that had been taken charge from the Appellant from the time

CA-HCC 0163/2023

7 | P a g e

it was taken into custody to the time it reaches the Government Analyst

and comes back to the court should be established.

Under the first ground of appeal, the Appellant takes up the position that

there is a discrepancy in the weight of Heroin recovered from the Appellant

and the Government Analyst Report. The Counsel for the Appellant contends

that the Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself by failing to analyse the

weight discrepancy which disturbs the production chain. He submits further

that this is a substantial fact that the prosecution will have to prove beyond

a reasonable doubt.

According to the Chief Investigation Officer PW1, SI Gamini, the substance

found in the possession of the Appellant was weighed using an electronic

scale used in the afore-mentioned jewellery shop. He had chosen this option

considering that the weighing machines used in the jewellery shops are

registered and accurate. In that instance, the parcel recovered from the

Appellant was seem to be weighing about 8.400 grams of substance.

However, when the productions were taken to the Government Analyst

Department, a notable difference in weight had been noted in the parcel.

According to the Government Analyst Report which had been marked as P9

in the High Court Trial, the weight of the parcel was mentioned as 6.956

grams. This is 1.494 grams less than the original weight. The Government

Analyst has also made a note of it in the report. Hence, the Appellant argues

that the weight difference creates a serious doubt in the prosecution case.

When this Court invited the Respondent to explain the discrepancy in the

weight of the substance, the Additional Solicitor General submitted that as

the Appellant had admitted the Government Analyst Report under Section

420 of the CPC, he cannot contest this discrepancy in the appeal.

CA-HCC 0163/2023

8 | P a g e

The Appellant admitted the contents of the Government Analyst Report. The

prosecution had not taken any endeavour to clarify the weight discrepancy

highlighted by the Government Analyst during the trial.

Nevertheless, it is the paramount duty of the Prosecution to prove that it is

the same production recovered at the time of detection which has reached

the Government Analyst. The main reason is to establish that the evidence,

which is related to the alleged crime, was collected from the accused and was

in its original condition rather than having been tempered with or planted

deceitfully to make someone else guilty, which helps in establishing an

undisturbed inward journey of the substance, which as stated above is

essential in the prosecution of accused for drug related offences. Handling of

production evidence is a lengthy process but the court necessitates it for the

proper adjudication of causes related to drugs cases. This proves the

integrity of the production which had been recovered from the accused has

been preserved until it reaches the Government Analyst Department.

In this regard, the Learned High Court Judge in her judgment had not made

any comments about the discrepancy in weight in the given case. In the

absence of any comment regarding this particular point; no doubt, the

Appellant had not been afforded a fair trial. Thereby, this has caused great

prejudice to him.

As the weight discrepancy is a substantial fact, the prosecution had not put

relevant questions to PW1. Further, the Government Analyst was not called

to explain the reason for the difference. Considering the pure Heroin detected

in this case, a discrepancy in weight is crucial which certainly have impact

on the outcome of the net result of the Government Analyst.

As the discrepancy in weight in a drug related case of this nature is crucial

to the outcome of the case, it is not necessary to address the other grounds

of appeal raised by the Appellant.

Therefore, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on the Appellant

by the Learned High Court Judge of Kegalle dated 06/04/2023. Therefore,

he is acquitted from both charges.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Kegalle along with the original case record.

I agree.
