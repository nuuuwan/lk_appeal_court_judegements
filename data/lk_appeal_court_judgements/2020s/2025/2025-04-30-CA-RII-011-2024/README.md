JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Defendants- Judgement Debtor- Respondents- Petitioners- Petitioners

(hereinafter referred to as the Petitioners) instituted this action by petition dated

07.02.2024 invoking the restitutionary jurisdiction of this Court seeking inter alia

to set aside the order of the High Court of the Western Province exercising its Civil

Appellate Jurisdiction holden in Colombo directing the appeal bearing case No.

WP/HCCA/Col/270/22/LA relating to the appeal from the order granting the

execution of the writ pending appeal to be resumed as contained in the order

marked P8 dated 01.02.2024.

Page 8 of 12

As agreed by the parties, this judgment binds on C.A.RII-0012-24, C.A.RII-0013-

24, C.A.RII-0014-24, C.A.RII-0015-24 and C.A.RII-0016-24.

The Petitioners state that the Plaintiff- Judgment Creditor- Petitioner-

Respondent- Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) instituted an

action against the Petitioners seeking inter alia a declaration of title and

ejectment of the Petitioners from the premises described in the plaint. The

Petitioners further state that by judgment dated 21.10.2019, the Learned District

Judge granted the reliefs as prayed for in the said Plaint. The Petitioners being

aggrieved by the said judgment, filed an appeal, and the final/substantive appeal

bearing case No. WP/HCCA/COL/13/2021 (F) was fixed for argument on

09.02.2024.

The Petitioners aver that when the matters remained as such, on 16.02.2021, the

Respondents filed an application in the District Court seeking an execution of the

writ pending appeal. After the Petitioners filed their statements of objections, an

inquiry was disposed of by way of written submissions. Thereafter, by order dated

07.10.2022, the Learned Additional District Judge allowed the application for writ

pending appeal.

The Petitioners being aggrieved by the said order dated 07.10.2022 filed a leave to

appeal application in case bearing No. WP/HCCA/Col/270/22/LA. When the matter

was supported on 13.10.2022, the Court stayed the proceedings in the District

Court of Colombo and number of dates were given by the Courts to support the

matter. After hearing both sides, the Court fixed the case for order with regard to

leave on 22.11.2022 and the stay order was extended.

We note that the Courts had taken a number of dates to deliver the said order.

(22.11.2022/ 06.12.2022/ 23.01.2023/ 24.03.2023/ 19.05.2023/ 25.07.2023)

Page 9 of 12

Thereafter, due to the reconstruction of the benches, the matter was refixed for

argument on 21.11.2023. When the matter came up on 01.02.2024, the Journal

Entry stated that:

What transpired from the said Journal Entry is that 09.02.2024 was the same date

on which the final/substantive appeal in the case bearing No.

WP/HCCA/COL/13/2021 (F) is listed for argument. The Petitioners wanted the

appeal to be taken first.

In this context, the Petitioners have invoked the restitutionary jurisdiction of this

Court against the said order of the Learned Judges dated 01.02.2024 marked P8

on the basis that the said order is patently erroneous, unjust and thus shocks the

conscience of the Court.

Page 10 of 12

We are mindful that the object of filing a writ pending appeal is to give entitlement

to enjoy the fruits of the decree entered in his favour.

Section 761 of the Civil Procedure Code was interpreted by our Courts that within

a reasonable time means as soon as possible.

The plain reading of the said Journal Entry is that in view of the suggestion made

by the Counsel for the Petitioners that the Court should take up the appeal first,

the Learned judges have indicated that it could be considered on the next date.

The question before us is whether the Petitioners have the right to invoke the

jurisdiction of restitutio in integrum to quash the said decision.

The remedy of restitutio in integrum has taken deep root in our legal system. The

following cases elucidate the grounds on which the remedy of restiutio in integrum

has been awarded.

In Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd v. Shanmugam and another [1995] 1 SLR

55 His Lordship Ranaraja J. held,

Superior courts of this country have held that relief by way of

restitution in integrum in respect of judgments of original courts may be

sought where (a) the judgments have been obtained by fraud,

(Abeysekera-supra), by the production of false evidence, (Buyzer v.Eckert),

or non-disclosure of material facts, (Perera v. Ekanaike), or where

judgment has been obtained by force or fraud, (Gunaratne v.Dingiri Banda,

Jayasuriya v. Kotelawela). (b) Where fresh evidence has cropped up since

judgment which was unknown earlier to the parties relying on it,

(Sinnethamby-supra), and fresh evidence which no reasonable diligence

could have helped to disclose earlier, (c) Where judgments have been

pronounced by mistake and decrees entered thereon, (Sinnethamby-

supra), provided of course that it is an error which connotes a reasonable or

excusable error, (Perera v. Don Simon). The remedy could therefore be

availed of where an Attorney-at-Law has by mistake consented to

judgment contrary to express instructions of his client, for in such cases it

could be said that there was in reality no consent, (Phipps-Supra, Narayan

Page 11 of 12

Chetty v. Azeez), but not where the Attorney-at-Law has been given a

general authority to settle or compromise a case, (Silva v. Fonseka).

His Lordship Nawaz J. in Edirisinghe Arachchilage Indrani Chandralatha v.

Elrick Ratnam, CA R.I. Case No. 64/2012 decided on 02.08.2017, reaffirmed these

grounds as follows,

Any party who is aggrieved by a judgment, decree or order of the District

Court or Family Court may apply for the interference of the Court and relief

by way of restitutio in integrum if good grounds are shown. The just grounds

for restitution are fraud, fear, minority etc. Our Superior Courts have held

that the power of the Court to grant relief by way of restitutio in integrum,

in respect of judgments of original Courts, is a matter of grace and

discretion, and such relief may be sought only in the following

circumstances:-

a) Fraud

b) False evidence

c) Non-disclosure of material facts

d) Deception

e) Fresh evidence

f) Mistake

g) Fear

In the instant application, nothing was indicated by the Petitioners that the order

made on 01.02.2024 falls under the above grounds. The particular order marked

P8 is an order postponing the application made by the Counsels for the Petitioners.

The question is whether that Court has taken any decision which allows invoking

the extraordinary restitutionary jurisdiction. We do not see any merits in the said

application. we are also mindful that writ pending appeals and appeals are

different applications.

Page 12 of 12

The purpose of filing a writ pending appeal is to enjoy the fruits of the order which

is in favour. We are also mindful that the Court has also taken a number of days

to deliver the order on leave to appeal.

For the above-said reasons, we hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish any

exceptional circumstances to invoke the restitutionary jurisdiction, which is an

extraordinary jurisdiction.

We dismiss the application with costs of Rs. 50,000/-.
