JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused Appellant (herein after referred to as “the 2nd and 3rd Accused) was

indicted together with Kachchakaduwe Pradeep Chaminda Sumith, who is dead (1st

Accused), before the High Court of Chillaw for the alleged murder of one Dehiwattage

Ajith Shantha Kumara, which is punishable under Section 296 read with Section 32

of the Penal Code.

The Prosecution led the evidence through nine witnesses and marking productions

from P1 to P2, and thereafter closed its case. The Accused, in their defence, made

dock statements. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge, by

judgment dated 01.12.2015, found both Accused guilty of murder and imposed the

death sentence.

Being aggrieved by said judgment and sentence, this appeal was preferred by the 2nd

and 3rd Accused. The following Grounds of Appeal were urged by the counsel for the

Accused.

1. Learned Trial Judge failed to comply with Section 48 of the Judicature Act

relating to the adoption of proceedings.

2. Evidence of the sole eye-witness wholly conflicts with the evidence of PW 2 and

police evidence with regard to the crime scene, thereby creating a serious doubt

in the version of the eye-witness.

3. Evidence of the sole eye-witness is plagued with serious infirmities which

render the conviction wholly unsafe.

4. Learned Trial Judge was totally oblivious to the highly contradictory evidence

between the prosecution witnesses and the unreliable nature of the testimony

of the said witness

During the course of the argument, the principal contention advanced by the counsel

for the accused was that the sole eyewitness, PW 01, the brother of the deceased,

failed to disclose the names of the Accused to the police at the earliest opportunity. It

4

was submitted that this omission casts serious doubt on the credibility of his

testimony and renders his evidence unreliable.

Before proceeding to evaluate the merits of this submission, it is necessary to set

out the factual narrative as presented by the prosecution.

The facts and circumstances of the case are as follows:

According to PW 01, Dehiwattage Premasiri, the brother of the deceased, who is the

only eyewitness, the death occurred on 10th February 1999. On that date, the

deceased was residing at a relative’s residence. The incident in question transpired

between approximately 3:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. along the Weherekala Temple Road.

At the time, the witness had arrived at the location on a bicycle, while the deceased

was approaching from the direction of the Daduruoya Road. They subsequently

encountered each other near the junction leading to Anamaduwa Road. At that

moment, three Accused approached them on a red bicycle. The witness stated that he

had known the 1st Accused since childhood, and had been acquainted with the 2nd

and 3rd Accused for approximately fifteen years. This witness revealed the

nicknames of the Accused, stating that the 1st Accused was known as ‘Meeya’, 2nd

Accused as ‘Kopparaya’.

The witness acknowledged that there had been ongoing tensions between the

residents of his village and those of the Accused’s village. Upon observing the Accused

approaching, and fearing for their safety, the witness and the deceased halted their

bicycle. The witness then abandoned the bicycle, fled down a nearby byroad, and

concealed himself behind a coconut tree. At that point, the Accused reached the

deceased. The witness testified that he observed the 3rd Accused stab his brother

three to four times in the chest, while the other Accused restrained him. After the

deceased collapsed to the ground, he was further stabbed in the back. Subsequently,

the 2nd Accused also stabbed the deceased while the 1st Accused continued to hold

him.

5

This witness later returned to the scene in the company of his relatives and

neighbours. Upon his return, he observed that the body of the deceased had been

moved and was now situated approximately 20 to 30 feet from the location where he

had initially seen it. While the witness and others were present, the police arrived at

the scene. At that point, this witness did not disclose the names of the Accused to the

PW 06. It should be noted that the next day he has revealed the names of the accused

to the police when he made a statement.

During the cross-examination, the witness admitted that the deceased and another

brother known as Hubert were suspects in the murder of the brother of the 3rd

Accused. Further, the witness admitted he left the bicycle and ran to the byroad, but

the 1st accused had caught the deceased with his shirt coming towards while driving.

Further denied the statement that they first met the deceased, which was recorded

in the police statement. During the cross-examination, the witness saw one knife in

the hands of the 3rd Accused that was 8 inches long. And the witness stated that he

couldn't remember who was in the front when he and the deceased were riding a

bicycle.

According to the testimony of PW 02, Dehiwatte Manjula Pradeep, a relative of the

deceased, got to know that the deceased had been stabbed only after the news

spread in the village and stated that the incident occurred on land belonging to

Premasiri, situated within the village. The three accused were known to him as they

were from the adjoining village. Upon arrival at the scene, the deceased was found

lying face down on the ground and was unable to speak. The deceased was

subsequently admitted to Negombo Hospital.

According to the testimony of PW 5, Nihal Upatissa Abeweera Gunasinghe, who was

serving as Inspector of Police at Chilaw at the relevant time, he was informed of the

incident via a telephone call. He thereafter dispatched PW 6, Nishantha Weerasingha

to the location. Upon receiving confirmation that the individual in question was dead,

the witness proceeded to the scene. On arrival, he observed bloodstains in proximity

to the body, behind the residence of one Premasiri, and near a coconut tree situated

6

behind an unfinished house. According to PW 05, despite being present at the scene,

no witness mentioned any names of the Accused. During cross-examination, the

witness conceded that he could not state with certainty the precise location at which

the incident occurred. It was further admitted that the witness did not proceed to the

scene accompanied by any other eyewitnesses, but went there solely in the company

of PW 06.

PW 6, Nishantha Weerasinghe, who was serving as a Sub-Inspector at the relevant

time, testified that upon informing the appropriate police officer of the incident, the

officer proceeded to the scene at Weherakale at approximately 3:40 p.m.,

accompanied by four other officers. He observed that, upon arrival, the deceased was

lying on the ground with visible injuries to the face and body. At around 5:00 p.m.,

PW 6 commenced recording his observations at the location when he inquired from

the crowd there. PW 1 had indicated to him that he was with the deceased at the time

of the incident, and a group of individuals had apprehended the deceased and

attacked him with a knife, but he had not mentioned the names of the accused.

The question is whether the failure to disclose the accused's names to the police officer

at the very first opportunity, and later implicating them by name, will affect the

trustworthiness of this witness.

As a general principle, the court expects that a reasonable and prudent individual

will promptly disclose any information they possess, particularly concerning a crime,

to the police without undue delay. Such immediate disclosure reflects spontaneity

and credibility in the communication of facts. However, if the individual fails to

mention key details initially and only reveals significant information at a later stage,

their testimony may be deemed inconsistent. This principle is governed by Section

157 of the Evidence Ordinance, which addresses the relevance of previous statements

made to authorities.

7

This concept was discussed in The Law of Evidence, Volume II, Book 2, E.R.S.R.Comaraswamy, at page 758:

“(3) Reason for rule in Section 157

The section proceeds upon the principle that consistency is a ground for belief in the

veracity of a witness, just as inconsistency is a ground for disbelieving him. But the

corroborative value of such previous statements varies and depends on the

circumstances of each case. A person can adhere to falsehood, once uttered, when he

has a motive for it.

(4) The two circumstances set out in Section 157

Section 157 requires that the former statement must have been made

(A) At or about the time when the fact took place, or

(B) Before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact.

(A) At or about the time when the fact took place

Generally, statements made immediately or soon after the occurrence of an event, so

that it could not have been made for the purpose of creating evidence, contain truth,

for sufficient time may not have elapsed for concoctions and fabrications to creep in.

Therefore, such statements are a legitimate means of corroboration on the basis of

consistency. They support the credibility of the person whose evidence is

corroborated. The object of this part of the section is to admit statements made at a

time when the mind of the witness is still so connected with the events as to make it

probable that his description of them then would be accurate. But lapse of time

sufficient for reflection would make the statement of very little value and even

dangerous, as being capable of fabrication.

8

The statement must be made at once or at least shortly after when a reasonable

opportunity presents itself. What is a reasonable time is a question of fact in each

case. It should be made "at or about the time" and not "at any time after the event.

…...

The question whether the statement was made "about the time when the fact took

place" is a question to be decided by the judge at the time when the evidence is

tendered.

The words "about the time" give the judge a latitude in this matter.”

We note that PW 01’s assertion that he disclosed the names of the Accused at the

scene of the incident.

The PW 01’s evidence is not corroborated by PW 5 nor PW 6, who was present at the

location shortly after the incident and commenced official observations.

We note that, according to PW 01, he has come back to the scene with relatives, where

PW 06 questioned them with regard to the incident. But according to the PW 06, no

one mentioned the names of the Accused at that point. This suggests that PW 01 has

failed to disclose the names of the accused to those who accompanied him.

9

PW 6 makes no mention of any identification of the Accused by PW 01 at that time.

PW 05 also asserted that he went along with his officers only and not with any other witnesses,

and that he did not mention any witness by name, including the Accused, at that time.

According to police evidence gathered during the investigation, shortly after the

incident occurred, officers questioned the crowd present at the scene. Witness No.

01, who was among the crowd, did not disclose the names of the accused at that time,

despite having the opportunity to do so. It was later established that the accused

individuals were known to him.

10

Subsequently, the witness informed the court that the deceased had been involved

in the murder of a relative of the accused. However, he only identified the accused

to the police the following day—approximately 24 hours after the incident. He did

not provide any explanation for his initial failure to name the accused.

Given the absence of a justification for this delay, the court must consider whether

the witness genuinely observed the incident or is fabricating evidence against the

accused.

During the course of the argument, the Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General

drew the attention of this Court to the following case.

Kahadagamage Dharmasiri Bogahahena v. The Republic of Sri Lanka, SC Appeal

No. 04/2009, Decided on 03.02.2012. In the said case, the 1st witness in his statement

did not reflect the identity of the appellant. Though he was known to her. And the

statement of the 2nd witness was recorded belatedly.

The belatedness of identification was considered by Shiranee Tilakawardane, J. she

has stated that:

“This Court accepts that the statement of the 1st witness did not reflect the

identity of the 1st appellant, though he was known to her and the statement

of the 2nd witness was recorded belatedly. When considering the belated

evidence or a belated statement, one cannot neglect the basis for such delay

which transpired in the evidence. The Courts must look at the broader

spectrum and must take into account the holistic picture of the occurrences

that the family had been affected by, not forgetting the civil unrest and political

tension in the country during 1980's to early 1990's during which the JVP

(Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, a Marxist Sinhalese Political Party)

insurrection took place accounting to a large number of killings (Gunaratna,

R. (1990), Sri Lanka, a lost revolution?. The inside story of the JVP, Institute

11

of Fundamental Studies, Sri Lanka). The famous Embilipitiya abduction and

murder case, Dayatanda Lokugalappaththi and eight others v.

The state [2003] 3 Sri.L. R362, illustrates the dark and bleak time period that

brought consternation and struck an almost unshakable fear into the hearts of

the people of Sri Lanka.

It was in the backdrop of such times, that the husband of the deceased was

murdered in 1989 and four years later, in this particular incident, the deceased

was murdered at her residence, in front of her mother and her 9 year old son,

who were the main eyewitnesses at the trial in the High Court.

The first witness, the mother of the deceased, conceded at the trial that she

had not disclosed the identity of the appellant in her first statement as the

Appellant had instilled the fear of death into her, when, after shooting the

deceased, he had aimed the same gun at her and threatened them with death

If she informed or divulged his identity or hie complicity to the police, The

witness avers that she was so terrified, that even though she knew the identity

of this assailant, she did not disclose his identity even to her youngest daughter

Ranjinie, who was dispatched to the police station to report the murder.”

In the present case, PW 01 did not state that he was in fear following the incident.

Furthermore, there is no evidence on record explaining his failure to disclose the

names of the accused.

We note that PW 01 claims to have known the 1st Accused since childhood, and the

others for over fifteen years. It is reasonable to expect that a person of ordinary

prudence, having witnessed the murder of his own brother, would have immediately

named the Accused to the police. The absence of such disclosure at the earliest

opportunity casts doubts on the spontaneity and reliability of his testimony.

Furthermore, PW 01 admitted during cross-examination that he did not proceed to

the scene with any other eyewitnesses and was accompanied only by PW 6. This

12

further weakens the credibility of his account, as it suggests a lack of independent

corroboration at the time of the alleged identification. The delay in naming the

Accused, despite the witness’s familiarity with them and the gravity of the incident,

raises serious concerns about the authenticity of his narrative. In light of these

inconsistencies, the Court finds that PW 01’s evidence must be approached with

caution and cannot be accepted as wholly reliable.

We hold that the Learned High Court Judge erred in failing to adequately consider a

material aspect of the evidence, namely, that the sole eyewitness, PW 01, the brother

of the deceased, did not disclose the names of the Accused to the police at the earliest

opportunity and misdirected himself.

For the aforementioned reasons, we set aside the conviction and sentence against the

accused imposed on 01.12.2015.

Appeal allowed.
