Before: M. T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J (President C/A)- Acting.

K. P. FERNANDO, J. Counsel: Appearance not marked for the Petitioners.

S. Soyza SSC for the State. Supported on: 03.04.2025 Decided on: 04.04.2025 MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. (President of The Court of Appeal- Acting) The Petitioner, team leader of an independent group, is seeking, Inter alia, a mandate in

the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 6th Respondent, Returning

Officer of Vavuniya, rejecting the nomination papers submitted by the Petitioner for the

Vavuniya North Pradeshiya Sabha elections scheduled to be held on 06.05.2025.

Moreover, seeking a writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to 6th Respondents to accept the

said nomination papers on the Petitioners.

Admittedly the nomination papers submitted by the Petitioner was rejected by the

returning officer on the footing that the copies of the birth certificate of the candidates are

not certified. And whereas those documents are mere photocopies. The learned counsel

for the Petitioner relied upon the judgement of Shirani Tilakawardane J, in the case of D.

M. Jayaratne Vs. Vaas Gunawardane and others1 where her Ladyship observed that the

submitting of the photocopies of the birth certificate is adequate to comply with the

provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance No. 53 of 1946 (as amended).

Moreover, the learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that in terms of the

guidelines issued by the Commissioner General of Elections mere copies of the birth

certificate is sufficient to maintain a valid application.

1 CA/WRT/325/2002 dated 28.02.2002

In terms of Section 28(4A) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance it is

abundantly clear that a certified copy of the birth certificate of every youth candidate

should be tendered which reads as follows;

(4A) A certified copy of the birth Certificate of every youth whose name appears in the nomination paper or an affidavit signed by such youth, certifying his date of birth shall be attached to such nomination paper.

Given that the statutory provision is clear and unambiguous, all parties and

candidates must adhere to it strictly. The legislative intent is explicit, the copy of the

birth certificate must be certified by a legally authorized person. In the present case,

the Petitioner admittedly submitted uncertified photocopies, which contravene the

express requirement of the law.

It is pertinent to note that permitting mere photocopies of birth certificates, without

certification by a legally authorized person, opens the door to potential fraud, forgery,

and manipulation. Unlike certified copies, which bear an official seal or attestation

confirming their authenticity, ordinary photocopies can be altered, tampered with, or

falsified without detection. The very purpose of certification is to safeguard against

such risks, when a certifying officer examines the original document and endorses the

copy, they verify its accuracy and create a legally enforceable record of its

authenticity. Without this step, there is no assurance that the submitted documents

are genuine, undermining the integrity of the electoral process.

I am unable to agree with the observation of Tilakawardane, J. in the aforementioned

case that a mere photocopy of a birth certificate suffices for compliance with

nomination requirements. With respect, this interpretation runs contrary to the

express language of Section 28(4A) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance,

which explicitly mandates the submission of a certified copy of the birth certificate.

The statutory provision leaves no room for ambiguity, the legislature in its wisdom

4

has imposed this requirement precisely to ensure the authenticity of documentation

in the electoral process.

Similarly, to the extent that the guideline issued by the Election Commissioner

purports to permit the submission of uncertified copies of birth certificates, such

direction is fundamentally inconsistent with the clear provisions of Section 28(4A).

Administrative guidelines cannot override or dilute substantive statutory

requirements. Consequently, that portion of the guideline which suggests that

uncertified copies are acceptable has no legal force or validity, being ultra vires the

parent legislation.

In those circumstances, I am of the view that there is no basis for this Court to interfere

with the determination of the Returning Officer, rejecting the nomination papers of

the Petitioner on the basis that the Petitioner failed to submit certified birth certificate

copies of the candidates. Thus, the application is dismissed, no costs.

This judgement is applicable and binding on all parties in the connected applications

bearing nos. WRT/276 and 267/2025 as well.

I agree.
