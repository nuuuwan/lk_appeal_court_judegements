JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) has been

indicted in the High Court of Anuradhapura in High Court case no. HC

39/2014.

2. The charge in the indictment is as follows;

That on or about 30.05.2013, at Anuradhapura, within the

jurisdiction of this Court, you did commit murder by causing the

3

death of one Wedhahenalage Premadasage, and that you have

thereby committed an offence punishable under section 296 of the

Penal Code.

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge has convicted the

appellant of the charge and sentenced him to death. The appellant aggrieved by

the conviction and the sentencing order has preferred the instant appeal to this

Court.

Case of the prosecution

4. The appellant has been residing in a house located on a land behind that of

PW02 on 30.05.2013. At approximately 03.30 pm, PW02 has gone to fetch

water from the tube well situated in the appellants garden. During her visit,

she has witnessed the appellant strike the deceased twice in the face and arm

with the appellants hand. Later around 04.30 pm when PW02 returned to fetch

water a second time, she has heard the deceased pleading with the appellant.

At that moment, PW02 has heard the appellant utter the words

, indicating that the deceased would be killed gradually. On the third

visit of PW02, there had been a stark silence.

4

5. On 31.05.2013, PW04 has visited the appellants house on the request of an

acquaintance to transport a patient to hospital. At that time, PW04 has

observed the appellant and a third individual consuming alcohol while the

deceased was lying on a mat inside the house. The deceased has had injuries

on his face and a knee. Upon inquiry, PW04 had been informed by the third

individual that the deceased has had a fall. Following their consumption of

alcohol, the appellant and the third individual with PW04 driving has

transported the deceased to the hospital in a three-wheel scooter.

6. The deceased while receiving treatment as an indoor patient has passed away

around 1.30 pm on 31.05.2013.

Case of the appellant

7. The appellant has maintained that he has no connection to the alleged

circumstances surrounding the death of the deceased.

8. When the appeal was taken up for argument, the Learned Counsel for the

appellant, urged the following grounds of appeal;

5

i. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in law by failing to consider that

the items of circumstantial evidence elicited at the Trial are not

sufficient to draw an adverse inference that it was the appellant

who committed the murder?

a. That the Learned Trial Judge had even failed to identify that

this case is a case of circumstantial evidence.

ii. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in law by failing to consider that

the prosecution had failed to exclude the possibility of a third party

committing the offence in this case and thus a reasonable doubt is

cast on the case?

iii. Did the Learned Trial Judge err in law by failing to consider that

the appellant should not have been convicted for murder as that

the prosecution has failed to prove murderous intention beyond

reasonable doubt?

9. Upon the body of the deceased being identified by the nephew and the sister-in-

law of his to be that of the deceased, PW11, Dr. B. L. Waidyarathne, Specialist

Judicial Medical Officer, attached to the Teaching Hospital in Anuradhapura at

6

that time has conducted a post-mortem examination on June 02.2013 at the

Medico-Legal Morgue Teaching Hospital Anuradhapura.

10. PW11 has observed a total of 30 different injuries on the body of the deceased.

He has proceeded to identify those injuries as abrasions, contusions, and

lacerations. Additionally, he has observed fractures including a fracture of the

hyoid bone, a fracture of the right greater horn of the thyroid cartilage and

fractures of the second to eight ribs on the left side. The examination has also

revealed acute subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage and cortical

contusions which were associated with the external injuries.

11. Based on his findings, PW11 has expressed the opinion that the cause of death

was due to multiple injuries sustained to the head and the chest, likely

resulting from an assault with blunt objects, most probably, involving hands

and feet.

12. The narrative provided by PW02 indicates that she saw the appellant strike the

deceased twice. Once in the face and once in the arm. However, she has not

witnessed the appellant strike the deceased on the head or stamp on him while

he was lying on the ground. Therefore, it is evident that the appellant has had

7

no opportunity to cause the external injuries associated with the hemorrhage

and the fractured ribs that were observed.

13. Consequently, it is clear that the injuries that were sufficient in the ordinary

course of nature to cause the death of the deceased have been inflicted

subsequently. PW04 has reported seeing a third individual present at the scene

where the deceased lay with such injuries. In the light of the absence of

evidence suggesting otherwise, the prosecution has failed to eliminate the

possibility that this third individual could have struck the deceased and

inflicted the injuries that were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to

cause the death of the deceased.

14. As a result the prosecution has relied on suspicious circumstances, rather than

concrete circumstances, thereby, failing to meet the burden of proof in

establishing that the appellant inflicted the injuries that were sufficient in the

ordinary course of nature to cause the death of the deceased. The

establishment of suspicious circumstances alone is generally not sufficient to

meet the burden of proof to establish an accused guilt beyond a reasonable

doubt. Suspicion may arise further questions but it does not equate to proof of

guilt.

8

15. In Munirathne And Others vs. The State 2001 2 SLR page 382 at page 394,

Justice Kulathilaka has stated as follows;

In the attendant circumstances of this case, we are tempted

to reiterate the wise observations made by Basnayake, CJ, in The

Queen vs. M.G.Sumanasena(7). It is to the following effect.

Suspicious circumstances do not establish quilt.

Nor does the proof of any number of suspicious

circumstances relieve the prosecution of its burden of

proving the case against the accused beyond a reasonable

doubt and compel the accused to give or call

evidence.The burden of establishing circumstances which

not only establish the accuseds guilt but are also

inconsistent with his innocence remains on the prosecution

throughout the trial and is the same in a case of

circumstantial evidence as in a case of direct evidence.

16. Circumstantial evidence refers to evidence that relies on an inference to connect

it to a conclusion of fact, in contrast to direct evidence which proves a fact

9

directly i.e. like a witness testifying that he saw a crime occur, circumstantial

evidence requires a series of facts or circumstances that lead to a conclusion.

To prove a case through circumstantial evidence, one typically need to gather

various pieces of circumstantial evidence that are relevant to the case.

Thereafter, clearly demonstrate how those pieces of evidence connect to each

other and lead to a reasonable inference about the facts of the case. Argue

against other reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the same

evidence and combine all pieces of evidence into a compelling story that makes

the case more convincing. Ultimately, the strength of secondary evidence can lie

in its ability to paint a broader picture when combined with other evidence

making a case more persuasive to a judge.

17. In Bandara Deegahawathura vs. Attorney General CA No. 61/2001 decided

on 02.08.2005, Justice Sisira Abrew discussing the nature of the inferences

that could be drawn from circumstantial evidence and how such inferences

could be drawn has stated as follows;

The case against the appellant depended entirely on

circumstantial evidence. Therefore it is necessary to consider the

principles governing the cases of circumstantial evidence.

10

In the case of King Vs Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254 Soertsz J

remarked as follows. In order to base a conviction on

circumstantial evidence the jury must be satisfied that the evidence

was consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with

any reasonably hypothesis of his innocence.

In King Vs Appuhamy 46 NLR 128 Keuneman J held that in

order to justify the inference of guilty from purely circumstantial

evidence, the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the

innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation upon any

other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt.

In Podisingho Vs. King 53 NLR 49 Dias J held that in a case

of circumstantial evidence it is the duty of the trial Judge to tell the

jury that such evidence must be totally inconsistent with the

innocence of the accused and must only be consistent with his

guilt.

In Emperor Vs Browning (1917) 18 Cr. L.J.482 court held

the jury must decide whether the facts proved exclude the

possibility that the act was done by some other person, and if they

have doubts, the prisoner must have the benefits of those doubts.

11

Having regard to the principles laid down in the above

judicial decisions I hold that in a case of circumstantial evidence in

order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the jury or the

trial judge as the case may be must be satisfied on following

grounds. (a) Proved facts must be consistent only with the guilt of

the accused (b) Proved facts must point the finger of guilt only to the

accused (c) Proved facts must be incompatible and inconsistent with

the innocence of the accused. (d) Proved facts must be incapable of

any other reasonable explanation than that of his guilt. In a case of

circumstantial evidence, if two decisions are possible from the

proved facts, then the decision which is favorable to the accused

must be taken. In a case of circumstantial evidence, if the

circumstances found to be as consistent with the innocence as with

the guilt of the accused; or if an innocent explanation is found from

the evidence of the prosecution, no inference of guilt should be

drawn. Therefore if the prosecution seeks to prove a case purely on

circumstantial evidence, the prosecution must exclude the

possibility that the proved facts are consistent with the innocence of

the accused.

12

18. The circumstantial evidence gathered in this case leads to inconsistent and

inconclusive inferences. It does not rule out the possibility that a third

individual committed the act referred to in the charge. Furthermore, the

inferences drawn do not exclusively point out to the guilt of the appellant,

therefore, the interpretation that favors the appellant must be prioritized. This

creates a challenge in establishing the appellants guilt regarding the charge in

the indictment.

19. This particular offence has been committed in the year 2013. 12 years have

passed since then. Therefore, this Court finds that it does not seem just to call

upon the appellant to defend himself again after such an unconscionable lapse

of time.

In Queen vs. G. K. Jayasinghe 69 NLR 314 at page 328, Sansoni, J, has

stated,

we have considered whether we should order a new trial in this

case. We do not take that course, because there has been a lapse of

three years since the commission of the offences, and because of our

own view of the unreliable nature of the accomplices evidence on

which alone the prosecution case rests.

13

We accordingly direct that the judgment of acquittal be

entered.

20. Hence, this is not a fit case to order a re-trial.

21. Due to the circumstances set out above, I am inclined to interfere with the

disputed judgment and hereby set aside the conviction together with the

sentencing order. Accordingly acquit the appellant from the charge in the

indictment.

Appeal allowed.

22. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the

High Court of Anuradhapura for compliance.
