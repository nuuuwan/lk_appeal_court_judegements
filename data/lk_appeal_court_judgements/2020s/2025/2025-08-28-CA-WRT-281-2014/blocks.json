As such, the requirement to purchase a security stamp cannot be regarded as optional or voluntary, but compulsory. Accordingly, the Court is of the view that the compulsory nature of the above-requirement to purchase a security stamp takes the nature of a tax or a levy. However, it is observed that imposition of such requirement in the nature of a tax or levy was not contemplated under Section 10(1)(a) of the Act. It is observed that Section 10(1)(a) of the Act permits the issuance of general directions to manufacturers or traders in respect of labelling and packeting of any goods. However, the aforesaid requirement of affixing a Security Stamp as required under Direction P6 cannot be considered as directions to manufacturers or traders in respect of labelling and packeting. Because Section 10(1)(a) of the Act does not specifically permit the Authority to make directions setting a fee to be paid to a service provider for the issuance of such 'security stamp. However, even if assuming without conceding that said security stamp is considered as a mode of labelling under Section 10(1)(a),it is observed that the Authority is not empowered to make directions setting a fee for a service provider for such 'security stamp under Section 10 of the Act.",

It is correct that there may be situations where a statutory authority or a public officer lawfully enters into some form of contract which a member of the public, which involves the payment of a fee for services rendered, work done, or goods supplied. These are voluntary payments made by members of the public pursuant to a contract or other arrangements entered into at arms length. The payment of Rs 75 was not made on such a basis. The notices marked P and Q, issued by the 1st Respondent, require driving license holders to make that payment. It could by no means be considered a voluntary payment. It has to be considered as a levy that was made. In this",
