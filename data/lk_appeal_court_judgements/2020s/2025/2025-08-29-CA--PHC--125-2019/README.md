JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

This is an appeal arising from the order made by the Learned High Court Judge of the

Provincial High Court of Western Province, holding in Colombo, in the case No.

HCRA/66/17 on 31.07.2019.

According to the Petitioner, the Fraud Investigation Bureau, on a complaint made by the

Aggrieved party- Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent),

issued summons to the 1st,2nd, and 3rd Accused-Respondent-Appellants (hereafter

referred to as Appellants)

On 02.07.2015, the following charges were read over to the Appellants,

1. Infringement of the trade name and trademark titled 'CICRA' under section 121

of the Intellectual Property Act, No. 36 of 2003, read with section 186 (2).

2. Dishonest misappropriation of property worth Rs. 4 million purchased by the

Respondent for CICRA Institute of Education (Pvt) Ltd, under Section 386 of the

Penal Code, read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

After pleading not guilty to the charges on 26.10.2016, the Appellants proceeded to raise

preliminary objections concerning the contents of the charge sheet.

On 23.11.2016, the Learned Magistrate upheld the preliminary objections raised by the

Appellants and, exercising powers under Section 186 of the Criminal Procedure Code,

acquitted Appellants of all charges.

It is pertinent to set out the relevant portion of the order issued on 23.11.2016.

121 . 186 (2)

The primary reason cited by the learned Magistrate for dismissing the charges was that

they could not be sustained, given that the virtual complainant and the 1st and 2nd

Accused were directors and shared ownership of the CICRA.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Respondents invoked the revisionary jurisdiction

of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province, holding in Colombo.

In their statement of objection, the Appellant raised a preliminary objection, contending

that the Respondent had delayed nearly six months in filing the revision application

following the order issued by the Learned Magistrate.

Thereafter, the Learned High Court Judge delivered his order on 31.07.2019 and set aside

the order of the learned magistrate on the following grounds.

a) The duty to frame lawful charges is vested upon the learned Magistrate under

Section 182 of the CCPA

b) The Learned Magistrate discharged the Accused (now Appellants) before leading

any evidence;

c) If there were errors in the charge sheet, the learned Magistrate was duty-bound

to amend the charge, resorting to Section 167 of the CCPA

d) The impugned Order contains irrelevant matters, especially the case under the

Primary Courts Act and the case before the Commercial High Court.

e) The Learned Magistrate had arrived at certain findings based on factual matters

before any evidence had been led; and, therefore,

f) The impugned Order is defective.

The Learned High Court Judge also directed the Learned Magistrate to frame the charge

sheet and proceed to trial. This appeal challenges the said order main ground urged by

the Appellant is that the Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the preliminary

objections raised by them.

We acknowledge that the order challenged by the appellant was issued pursuant to the

exercise of revisionary jurisdiction by the Learned High Court Judge, as conferred under

the Constitution.

The Learned High Court Judge primarily reasoned that, under Section 182(1) of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 as amended, it is the Learned Magistrates

statutory duty to frame the charges.

182(1) - Where the Accused is brought or appears before the court, the Magistrate

shall, if there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the Accused, frame a

charge against the Accused

So, in the instant case, the reason given by the Learned Magistrate is that the charges

against the Accused are unattainable. It shows that the Learned Magistrate has failed to

follow the procedure properly.

The said order arising from the revisionary jurisdiction. Therefore, I am mindful of the

following judgements.

Wijesinghe Vs Tharmaratnam Srikanthas LR (IV) page 47 at page 49 Jameel J. CA

120/80, Decided on 14th October 1986

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the application

discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of court.

In the case of Bank of Ceylon Vs Kaleel and others [2004] 1 SLR 284, Per Wimalachandra

J

In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must have

occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which go beyond an

error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would instantly react to it;

the order complained of is of such a nature which would have shocked the

conscience of court.

Page 8 of 8

I am of the view that the order made by the Learned Magistrate warrants invoking the

revision Jurisdiction. Therefore, the Learned High Court Judge correctly considered

section 182 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code and made the said order.

For the above-said reasons, there is no need to interfere with the order made by the

Learned High Court Judge dated 31.07.2019.

For the aforesaid reasons, we dismiss the Appeal. No order for costs.

The Registrar is hereby instructed to transmit a copy of this Judgment to the Magistrate's

Court of Colombo to ensure compliance with the directive issued by the Learned High

Court Judge on 31.07.2019.
