JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted

before the High Court of Colombo on four counts for the offence of soliciting and

accepting a bribe from one S.K. Thivanka Lahiru Rupasinghe on 02.06.2016

punishable under Section 19(b) and (c) of the Bribery Act.

The Prosecution led evidence through 6 witnesses and marked the documents P1

P27 and closed its case. The Accused made a dock statement in defence.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court by judgment dated

13.03.2020 found the Accused guilty of all four counts and sentenced him to

undergo 5 years of rigorous imprisonment for each charge but to run concurrently.

Further, he imposed a fine of Rs. 5000/- for each count in default 1 year of rigorous

imprisonment. In addition, he ordered the recovery of the gratification said to have

been accepted by the Accused as a fine imposed by court in default another year of

rigorous imprisonment. Further, a compensation of Rs. 25,000/- was ordered to be

paid to PW1, in default 1 year of rigorous imprisonment.

Page 4 of 19

The Accused, being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentences, has now

preferred an appeal in this Court.

The grounds of appeal as urged by the Accused in his Written Submission, are as

follows;

1. The charge regarding solicitation and acceptance of bribe has not been

proved beyond reasonable doubt,

2. The Learned Trial Judge erred in law by failing to appreciate the

improbability of the evidence of PW1,

3. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that the material infirmities,

in the prosecutions case and the Learned Trial Judge has not dealt with

the inter se contradictions in evidence between the complainant and the

decoy,

4. The Learned High Court Judge has acted contrary toas he encroached into

the role of the prosecutor and thereby denied a fair trial to the Accused.

The facts and circumstances of the case are as follows;

According to PW1, the victim, he bought a land situated in Gandarawatte South,

Devinuwara with regard to which Deed of Transfer No. 14441 was executed. As

stated by PW1, he paid Rs. 17,000 as stamp duty on 02.01.2015. PW1 states that

he received a letter from the Accused who was a senior assessor of the Provincial

Revenue Department of the Matara Branch requiring PW1 to come to the said

office on 01.07.2016 to investigate regarding stamp duty of the said Deed.

Accordingly, PW1 met the Accused at the said office and PW1 was conveyed that

the correct amount of stamp duty for the said Deed was higher than the amount

PW1 had already paid, i.e. Rs. 17,000/-. Further, the Accused had indicated that

PW1 had to pay an additional amount of Rs. 32,000/-. Thereafter, PW1 has

requested the Accused that, ......

.

Then, PW4 namely Denzil, one of PW1s friends also came to the Accuseds office

and told the Accused to do something as PW1 is his friend. Thereafter, the Accused

Page 5 of 19

had asked whether the PW1 could bring 10,000/- to which the PW1 agreed.

Thereafter, the Accused filled out the bank slip and asked PW1 to deposit Rs.

5250/- to the Department otherwise PW1 will have to pay Rs. 32,000 more. In the

meantime, he had asked his wife to deposit the money. According to PW1, since

there was no reference number in the said bank slip, his wife could not pay the

money.

When PW1 asked PW4, to where this Rs. 10,000 needed to be paid, PW4 replied

that it was for the Accused. On that basis, the Accused had come to the conclusion

that it was a bribe and informed the Bribery Commission of this incident. The

Commission set up a raid and asked PW1 to hand over the alleged money to the

Accused in front of the decoy namely Gayan, PW2. Thereafter, both PW1 and PW2

to the Accuseds office but the Accused was not there. Thereafter, they went back

to the van where the officers of the Commission were there and informed PW3 that

the Accused was not there. Then, PW3 gave PW1 the money and asked him to

hand over the money to the Accused. Then they approached the Accused in his

office. Then PW1 told the Accused that they could not deposit money as there was

no reference number and the Accused filled out another form and PW1 told the

Accused that he brought the money that the Accused had asked for.

On page 134 of the brief;

10,000/- .

.

Thereafter, PW1 had taken the money from his purse and gave it to the Accused.

PW1 firmly states that the money was given to the Accuseds hand and the

Accused himself took the money and kept it in a diary.

Thereafter, the officers of the Commission came in led by I.P. Gunewardhena,

PW3.

The PW1 indicated that the money was given as a bribe for the work Accused had

done.

According to him, he did not see any signal given by Gayan, the decoy and that he

waited outside after the officers went inside the Accuseds office. The PW1 was

firm that the given money was kept in a diary.

During the cross-examination, PW1 indicated that he had paid Rs. 17,000/- as

stamp duty which was told to him by the Notary. Further, he admitted that he

indicated to the Department that he had paid Rs. 27,000/- as stamp duty. He was

consistent that the Accused had asked him to pay another Rs. 32,000/-. Further,

he indicated that he asked the friend as to whom the Rs. 10,000 needed to be paid.

Further, PW1 stated that originally he was asked to pay Rs. 32,000/ and later it

was brought down to Rs. 5250/-.

We observe that during the cross-examination, the question was put to PW1

whether he had shown the earlier receipts to the Accused, and this witness replied

that since it had been 3 years from the incident, he was unable to remember.

It shows that as a prudent man, there is no necessity for him to remember all the

nitty-gritty details of the incident. The reason is that due to the lack of skill in

observation upon any point that he thinks is unnecessary.

I am reminded of the observation made in Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai vs. State of

Gujarat AIR 1983 SC Page 753 at page 755 observed thus;

By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape is

replayed on the mental screen. Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to

recall accurately the sequence of events which take place in rapid succession

or in a short time span. A witness is liable to get confused, or mixed up when

interrogated later on.

I hold that this trivial contradiction does not affect the credibility of this witness.

On the other hand, he will remember what is important, which should have always

been in his memory, because that incident would not fade from his memory. In the

instant case, he was disturbed that the Accused had demanded money from him.

Then, he was instructed by the Bribery Commission to go with another person to

hand over the money. So, PW1 will remember how he gave the money.

Why I emphasize this is that PW1 was so sure and confident about the fact that

the Accused took money from him and kept it in his diary on his table. He was

consistent with his evidence.

When we consider the totality of the evidence, he was consistent on the point that

the Accused demanded money from him, and the money was given to the Accused.

Page 9 of 19

Even honest and truthful witnesses may differ in some details unrelated to the

main incident because of the power of observation. We are mindful of the words

uttered by His Lordship Sisira de Abrew J in Tikiri Banda Kulasekara v. The

Republic of Sri Lanka, CA Appeal No: 96/2002, Decided on 12.11.2007, and held

that;

Thus, there is a contradiction on this point. With regard to this

contradiction, I must mention here that the prosecution cannot be expected

to prove a case according to a mathematical formula and with 100%

accuracy as the case must be proved by evidence given by human beings.

These kinds of contradictions do occur when human witnesses give

evidence. In my view, this is not a vital contradiction and no prejudice has

been caused to the appellant by the failure on the part of the trial judge to

consider it.

We hold that this contradiction does not go to the root of the case.

What is meant by solicitation of bribe?

According to Section 89 (a) of the Bribery Act reads as follows;

For the purpose of this Act

(a) A person solicits a gratification if he, or any other person acting with

his knowledge or consent, directly or indirectly demands, invites, asks

for, or indicates willingness to receive, any gratification, whether for

the first-mentioned person or for any other person.

Section 19(c) of the Bribery Act places the burden on the Prosecution to establish

two key elements beyond reasonable doubt: firstly, that the Accused-appellant was

a state officer, and secondly, that he accepted gratification. Furthermore, this

gratification should serve as an inducement or reward for the performance of any

official act. The term "inducement" is explicitly mentioned in the section.

In the instant case, the Accused was a public officer attached to the Provincial

Inland Revenue Department, Matara. The main allegation made by PW1 was that

Page 10 of 19

the Accused had demanded Rs. 10,000 from him to reduce the amount of stamp

duty to Rs. 5250 from the higher amount to be paid. Further, there is no dispute

that PW1, the Complaint had originally paid an amount as stamp duty. According

to the Counsel for the Accused, it was undervalued.

According to PW5, Godakandage Lal Kantha confirmed that the Accused was a

public servant and that he had made entries that PW1 had to pay further Rs. 5250

as additional stamp duty. Therefore, the solicitation was for the reduced stamp

duty. The fact remains that money was recovered from the Accuseds table. But

according to the Accused, he had never received money and without his knowledge,

they kept it and went away.

According to PW2, Hapugoda Arachchi Kankanamge Gayan Prasad Chathuranga,

the decoy who joined PW1, on 02.06.2016, on the instructions of PW3, PW2 went

to the Accuseds office with PW1, but he was not there. Thereafter, they went to

the office again with the Rs. 10,000 and met the Accused. He had offered them to

sit and PW1 explained the reason for him to come. Thereafter, when PW1 asked

about the bribed money, the Accused asked him to give that money. According to

this witness, after receiving the money, the Accused kept it in the diary.

Both PW1 and PW2 corroborate each other that the Accused himself took the

money and kept it in the diary.

Both witnesses testify that the money (bribe) was handed over to the Accused and

then how he kept that money.

It is true that the defence position was that the money was kept by PW1.

Nevertheless, when we consider the evidence of PW1 and PW2, there is no

discrepancy between their evidence, so there is no reason for us to disbelieve their

evidence.

Further, we are also mindful that there is no reason for PW1 to implicate the

Accused.

When we consider the probability of these witnesses, according to the evidence, all

were seated. Without notice of the Accused, is it possible for PW1 to put the money

inside the diary? Or is it possible for the Accused to put the money himself?

According to PW3, the money was found in the diary on the table. This was not

disputed by the Accused.

Therefore, there is no reason for us to disbelieve the evidence of PW1 and PW2

with regard to the accepting the gratification. There is ample corroboration to

Page 12 of 19

support this conviction. Through these witnesses, the Prosecution has established

that the Accused had accepted money for the work he had done.

The main argument put forward by the Accused was that the Learned High Court

Judge had acted contrary to Section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance as he

encroached into the role of the prosecution and thereby denied a fair trial to the

Accused.

Under Section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance, a judge is vested with the power to

put questions to a witness in order to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant

facts, which reads as follows:

165. The Judge may, in order to discover or to obtain proper proof of

relevant facts, ask any question he pleases, in any form, at any time, of any

witness, or of the parties, about any fact relevant or irrelevant; and may

order the production of any document or thing; and neither the parties nor

their agents shall be entitled to make any objection to any such question or

order, nor, without the leave of the court, to cross-examine any witness upon

any answer given in reply to any such question:

Provided that the judgment must be based upon facts declared by this

Ordinance to be relevant and duly proved:

Provided also that this section shall not authorize any Judge to compel any

witness to answer any question, or to produce any document, which such

witness would be entitled to refuse to answer or produce under sections 121

to 131 both inclusive, if the question were asked or the document were called

for by the adverse party; nor shall the Judge ask any question which it

would be improper for any other person to ask under section 148 or 149; nor

shall he dispense with primary evidence of any document, excepting the

cases herein before excepted.

The object of this Section is that the Prosecution has to prove the case beyond

reasonable doubt. Therefore, the Trial Judge should convince himself that the

Page 13 of 19

evidence placed before him must establish the guilt of the Accused and the guilt

must be established beyond reasonable doubt.

We are also mindful that the evidential value should be so strong which should

have a high degree of probability. We are also mindful that a similar Section is

available in the Criminal Procedure Code, Section 439, which reads as follows:

Any court may at any stage of an inquiry, trial, or other proceeding under

this Code summon any person as a witness or examine any person in

attendance though not summoned as a witness or recall and re- examine

any person already examined: and the court shall summon and examine if

his evidence appears to it essential to the just decision of the case.

Our Courts were guided by the sentiments expressed by Lord Greene M.R. in Yuill

vs. Yuill, reported in 1945 1 ALL ER 183 at page 185, held that,

The other argument was to the effect that the trial was unsatisfactory

owing to the fact that the judge took an undue part in the examination of

witnesses. It was said that the judge put many more questions to witnesses

than all the counsel in the case put together and that he in effect took the

case out of counsel's hands to the embarrassment of counsel and the

prejudice of his case. The part which a judge ought to take while witnesses

are giving their evidence must, of course, rest with his discretion. But with

the utmost respect to the judge it was, I think, unfortunate that he took so

large a part as he did. I wish to say at once that having road the many pages

of the transcript over which the judge's questions extend to the exclusion of

counsel, often at the most critical points of the examination or cross-

examination, I can find no trace whatever of any tendency to take sides or

to press a witness in any way which could be considered undesirable. It is

quite plain to me that the judge was endeavouring to ascertain the truth in

the manner which at the moment seemed to him most convenient. But he

must, I think, have lost sight of the inconveniences which are apt to flow

from an undue participation by the judge in the examination of witnesses.

It is, of course, always proper for a judge- and it is his duty- to put questions

Page 14 of 19

with a vow to elucidating an obscure answer or when he thinks that the

witness has misunderstood a question put to him by counsel. If there are

matters which the judge considers have not been sufficiently cleared up or

questions which he himself thinks ought to have been put, he can, of course,

take steps to see that the deficiency is made good. It is, I think, generally

more convenient to do this when counsel has finished his questions or is

passing to a new subject.

Further on page 189

I may further point out that an impression as to the demeanour of a witness

ought not to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against the whole

of the evidence of the witness in question.

There is one further consideration which is particularly relevant to the

present case. A judge who observes the demeanour of the witnesses while

they are being examined by counsel has from his detached position a much

more favourable opportunity of forming a just appreciation than a judge

who himself conducts the examination. If he takes the latter course he, so

to speak, descends into the arena and is liable to have his vision, clouded by

the dust of the conflict. Unconsciously he deprives himself of the advantage

of calm and dispassionate observation. It is further to be remarked, as

everyone who has had experience of these matters knows, that the

demeanour of a witness is apt to be very different when he is boing

questioned by the judge to what it is when he is being questioned by counsel,

particularly when the judge's examination is, as it was. In the present case,

prolonged and covers practically the whole of the crucial matters which are

in issue.

Denning LJ has considered the above judgment in Jones vs. National Coal Board

(1957) 2 W.L.R. 760 and held that

Nevertheless, we are quite clear that the interventions, taken together,

were far more than they should have been. In the system of trial which we

Page 15 of 19

have evolved in this country, the judge sits to hear and determine the issues

raised by the parties, not to conduct an investigation or examination on

behalf of society at large, as happens, we believe, in some foreign countries.

Even in England, however, a judge is not a mere umpire to answer the

question " How's that?" His object, above all, is to find out the truth, and to

do justice according to law; and in the daily pursuit of it the advocate plays

an honourable and necessary role. Was it not Lord Eldon L.C. who said in a

notable passage that "truth is best discovered by powerful " statements on

both sides of the question"?: see Ex parte Lloyd. And Lord Greene M.R. who

explained that justice is best done by a judge who holds the balance between

the contending parties without himself taking part in their disputations? If

a judge, said Lord Greene, should himself conduct the examination of

witnesses, " he, so to speak, descends into the arena and is liable to have

his vision clouded by the dust of conflict" see Yuill v. Yuill.

Yes, he must keep his vision unclouded. It is all very well to paint justice

blind, but she does better without a bandage round her eyes. She should be

blind indeed to favour or prejudice, but clear to see which way lies the truth:

and the less dust there is about the better. Let the advocates one after the

other put the weights into the scales-the " nicely calculated less or more "-

but the judge at the end decides which way the balance tilts, be it ever so

slightly. So firmly is all this established in our law that the judge is not

allowed in a civil dispute to call a witness whom he thinks might throw

some light on the facts. He must rest content with the witnesses called by

the parties: see In re Enoch & Zaretzky, Bock & Co. So also it is for the

advocates, each in his turn, to examine the witnesses, and not for the judge

to take it on himself lest by so doing he appear to favour one side or the

other: see Rex v. Cain, Rex v. Bateman, and Harris v. Harris, by Birkett

L.J. especially. And it is for the advocate to state his case as fairly and

strongly as he can, without undue interruption, lest the sequence of his

argument be lost: see Reg. V. Clewer. The judge's part in all this is to

hearken to the evidence, only himself asking questions of witnesses when it

is necessary to clear up any point that has been overlooked or left obscure;

Page 16 of 19

to see that the advocates behave themselves seemly and keep to the rules

laid down by law; to exclude irrelevancies and discourage repetition; to

make sure by wise intervention that he follows the points that the advocates

are making and can assess their worth; at the end to make up his mind

where the truth lies. If he goes beyond this, he drops the mantle of a judge

and assumes the robe of an advocate; and the change does not become him

well. Lord Bacon spoke right when he said that: " Patience and gravity of

hearing is an "essential part of justice; and an over-speaking judge is no

well- "tuned cymbal."

The above judgments were considered by His Lordship Basnayake CJ in Queen v.

David Perera 66 NLR 553 and held that;

Judges would do well to bear in mind the words in the passages quoted

above and endeavour to abide by the counsel contained therein. In the

instant case it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the fact that there

were limits to the power of a Judge to ask questions had escaped the

attention of the learned Judge. Out of a total of 713 questions appearing in

the transcript 293 are attributed to him. Not all those questions appear to

be questions designed " to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts

". Some of them were questions asked from the accused-appellant who gave

evidence on his own behalf on matters of record in another proceeding

against the accused-appellant's father-in-law without due proof of those

matters. The accused was required to furnish an explanation for his conduct

in not obtaining from his father-in-law the details about the cases against

him for forgery or possession of counterfeit currency notes. The line of

questioning followed by the learned Judge tended to show the accused-

appellant in an unfavourable light and it is not unlikely that the jury

inferred, from the fact that his father-in-law was involved in cases of forgery

and possession of forged or counterfeit currency notes that the accused knew

or had reason to believe that the notes which were in his possession were

forged or counterfeit.

Page 17 of 19

With the above judgments, this Court can come to the conclusion that the Judge

has very wide powers of asking any question at any time, but the questions should

not prejudice the accused person who has not had the benefit of a fair trial.

We are also mindful that our Courts have considered that there is a duty cast on

the Judge to clear any doubt. Further, questions put by him aim to discover proper

proof of relevant facts. The Judge has the power to intervene at any time by way

of questions if he thinks it necessary to clear any doubts and he might ask further

questions into the matters that he deems important. By putting a question, the

Judge can observe their demeanor and form an opinion on whether the evidence

is truthful in their testimony on the vital matters. However, that intervention

should not be for one side. It should be fair to both sides. Further, the judge should

avoid repetition. The main purpose of questioning is to clear the doubts and make

up his mind where the truth lies.

Generally, our courts have held that the questions put forward by the judge should

not be unfavorable to the Accused. At the end of the day, the Judge has to come to

a conclusion whether the evidence placed was sufficient to prove the case.

In his written submission filed on 04.04.2025, the Accused has stated that the trial

Judge himself asked a series of questions regarding the identification of the

Accused.

When we peruse the evidence led on 19.09.2019, one of the questions asked by the

Court is that (on page 95 of the brief),

?. We observe that, when this question was asked, the witness had

already mentioned the name of the Accused. Further, the Judge had asked

questions about the place where the Accused and PW1 met. Another question was

asked regarding Denzil after the witness informed the Court about him.

When we observe the questions asked by the Court, nothing new was revealed by

the witness by answering such questions. In my opinion, those questions could

have been avoided as those did not have any impact on the prosecution witnesses.

We are also mindful that there were no leading questions asked by the Learned

Page 18 of 19

Judge favouring the Prosecution. The Counsel for the accused had failed to

establish that the questions asked by the Learned Trial Judge put the Accused in

an unfavorable position. On the other hand, that he favours the prosecution to

prove the guilt. I must say that most of the questions asked by the Learned Judge

were repetitive and those could have been avoided. I hold that the questions asked

by the Learned High Court Judge do not prejudice the Accused.

We further hold that the line of questioning adopted by the Learned High Court

Judge indicates that either the witness had misunderstood the question put

forward by the Prosecution Counsel, or that he needed a clear picture to ascertain

the truth for him to come to a conclusion.

We hold that although the Learned High Court Judge had raised several

questions, those questions do not create any doubt that the Accused was not given

a fair trial.

We are mindful of Article 138 (1) of the Constitution, which reads as follows;

(1) The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions of

the Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the correction

of all errors in fact or in law which shall be 128[committed by the High

Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by any Court

of First Instance], tribunal or other institution and sole and exclusive

cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, of all

causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things 129[of which such

High Court, Court of First Instance], tribunal or other institution may have

taken cognizance:

Provided that no judgement, decree or order of any court shall be reversed

or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not

prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of

justice.

Page 19 of 19

This is an appeal where the Appellant has to satisfy this Court that the questions

put forward by the Learned High Court Judge caused prejudice to the substantial

rights of the Accused or occasioned a failure of justice.

The Accused had failed to establish that he was denied a fair trial from the

questions asked by the Judge.

For the above-mentioned reasons, we dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction.
