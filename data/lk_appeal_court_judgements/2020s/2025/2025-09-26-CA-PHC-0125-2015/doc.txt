The instant appeal arises from an order of the learned High Court Judge of the

Central Province holden in Kandy dated 22.09.2015 (hereinafter called and

referred to as ‘the order’) whereby, the learned High Court Judge had dismissed

the application in revision filed before it by the Accused-Petitioner-Appellant

(hereinafter called and referred to as ‘the Appellant’) against the order of the

learned Magistrate of Nawalapitiya dated 29.11.2013 whereby, the learned

Magistrate had having rejected the showing cause of the Appellant, directed

him to be evicted from the State Land as morefully described in the schedule to

the application for ejectment made to it by the Plaintiff-Respondent-

Respondent being the Competent Authority (hereinafter called and referred to

as ‘the Plaintiff’) under and in terms of section 5 of the State Land (Recovery of

Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 (as amended) (hereinafter called and referred to

as ‘the Act’). The sole reason adduced in the order by the learned High Court

Judge for the dismissal of the application in revision filed before it being non-

appearance of both the Appellant as well as the Attorney-At-Law for the

Appellant in Court on the day when this matter had come up before it on

22.09.2015.

The Appellant in the averments in paragraphs 11, 12, 7(I) and (II) of his petition

of appeal (both the paragraphs 7(I) and (II) of his petition of appeal were so

numbered after paragraph 12 of the petition of appeal) sets out the facts and

circumstances which according to him, led him to have preferred this appeal to

this Court from the order of the learned High Court Judge in that it was

averred that the aforesaid revision application submitted to the High Court of

the Central Provincial was called on 02.09.2015 in Court for the purpose of

ascertaining whether there is any settlement in the application; and that since,

the 1st Respondent had informed the Court that there was no settlement, it was

then, orally, announced in open Court by the learned High Court Judge that

application in revision would be called on 22.10.2015 for the objections of the

2nd and 3rd Respondents, however, the Court had entered a different date in the

CA/PHC/0125/2015

Page 5 of 10

case record as the next date, namely; 22.09.2015, to that of the one that had

been orally, announced by Court on that day on 02.09.2015 as the next date

namely; 22.10.2015 thereby, causing grave prejudice to the Appellant by

dismissing the instant application for non-appearance of both the Appellant as

well as the Attorney-At-Law in Court on a day on 22.09.2015 other than the

day that had been so orally, announced by Court in open Court as the next day

of the case, namely; 22.10.2015.

The effect of the averments contained in paragraphs 11, 12, 7(I) and (II) of the

petition of appeal (both the paragraphs 7(I) and (II) of his petition of appeal

were so numbered after paragraph 12 of the petition of appeal) would be to

totally, contradict the record of the High Court of Kandy. It is clearly, laid down

in a number of decisions of the appellate Courts in Sri Lanka that, if a party

wishes to contradict the record, he ought to file the necessary papers before the

Court or Tribunal of first instance, institute an inquiry before such Court or

Tribunal, obtain an order and thereafter, if aggrieved by that order canvas the

matter in the appropriate proceedings before the Court of Appeal.

It was inter-alia held by Court in Vannakar and 6 Others v. Urhumalebbe

[1996] 2 Sri L.R 73 that, “…..Justice Dias in King v Jayawardena has

considered the earlier line of decisions laying down the cursus curiae with

regard to the legality of filing convenient and self-serving affidavits in appeal to

vary and contradict the record or with a view to purge a default which had

taken place before the Court of first instance. After a review of these decisions

he held that no party ought to be permitted to file a belated self-serving and

convenient affidavit to contradict the record, to vary the record or to purge a

default where they have not taken proper steps to file such affidavits before the

Judge or President of the Court of first instance or tribunal respectively. Vide

also the judgment of Justice Canekeratne in Gunewardena v Kelaart. If a party

had taken such steps to file papers before the presiding officer of Court of first

instance, then an inquiry would be held by him and the self serving statements

CA/PHC/0125/2015

Page 6 of 10

and averments could be evaluated after cross-examination of the affirmant

when he gives evidence at the inquiry. If such a procedure was adopted the

Court of Appeal would have the benefit of the recorded evidence which has

been subjected to cross examination and the benefit of the findings of the judge

of the Court of first instance. When such procedure is not adopted, Justice

Dias ruled that the Court of Appeal could not take into consideration self-

serving and convenient averments in the affidavits to contradict and vary the

record or to purge a default committed before the Court of first instance. In the

courts of first instance I have respectfully followed such prudent observations

made by judges with considerable experience in the actual working of the

Magistrate and of the District Courts. In the circumstances this Court refuses

to take into consideration the self-serving and convenient oral assertions on

the facts made by the learned counsel for the Appellant for the first time at the

hearing of this appeal. These matters ought to have been placed before the

inquiring Officer to enable him to conduct a proper investigation or inquiry into

the matters which are now sought to be adduced for the first time in appeal.”

So also was it inter-alia held in Shell Gas Company v. All Ceylon

Commercial and Industrial Workers' Union [1998] 1 Sri LR 118 at Page

120 that “Our courts have constantly drawn the attention of learned counsel

that it is not open to a petitioner to file a convenient and self-serving affidavit

for the first time before the Court of Appeal and thereby seek to contradict a

judicial or a quasi-judicial record and that if a litigant wishes to contradict the

record, he ought to file the necessary papers before the court or tribunal of first

instance, initiate an inquiry before such authority, obtain an order from the

deciding authority of first instance and thereafter raise the matter in

appropriate proceedings before the Appeal Court so that the appellate court

would be in a position on the material before it to make an appropriate

adjudication with the benefit of the order of the deciding authority in the first

instance. Vide Jayaweera v. Assistant Commissioner, Agrarian Services,

Ratnapura; Vannakar v. Urhuma Lebbe; King v. Jayawardena at 503 ;

CA/PHC/0125/2015

Page 7 of 10

Gunawardena v. Kelaart. It is irregular and improper for a petitioner to file a

convenient and self-serving affidavit in the Court of Appeal seeking to add to

the record and to amplify the record or to contradict the record. Justice Dias in

King v. Jayawardena (supra) after a review of a series of decisions, held that no

party ought to be permitted to file a self-serving and convenient affidavits to

contradict or to vary the record. In Vannakar's case, (supra) the Court of

Appeal Judge observed : “If the party had taken such steps to file papers before

the presiding officer of the court of first instance, then an inquiry would be held

by him and the self serving statements and averments would be evaluated after

cross-examination of the affirmant when he gives evidence at the inquiry. If

such a procedure was adopted the Court of Appeal would have the benefit of

the recorded evidence which has been subjected to cross-examination and the

benefit of the findings of the judge of the court of first instance. When such a

procedure is not adopted, Justice Dias ruled that the Court of Appeal could not

take into consideration self-serving and convenient averments in the affidavit to

contradict or vary the record".”

Furthermore, it was inter-alia held in Malani V. Somapala and Another

[2000] 2 Sri LR 196 that “The effect of the above averments contained in

paragraph 11 of the affidavit of the petitioner would be to totally contradict the

record. It is clearly laid down in a number of decisions of the Appellate Courts

in Sri Lanka that if a party wishes to contradict the record he ought to file the

necessary papers before the court or Tribunal of first instance, institute an

inquiry before such Court or Tribunal, obtain an order and thereafter if

aggrieved by that order canvass the matter in the appropriate proceedings

before the Court of Appeal. Vide the decision of Justice F. N. D. Jayasuriya in

Shell Gas Company vs All Ceylon Commercial and Industrial Workers' Union at

120; it was further held in the above case that it is not open to a petitioner to

tender convenient and self serving affidavits, sworn to by him for the first time

before the Court of appeal.”

CA/PHC/0125/2015

Page 8 of 10

In the light of the principle enunciated by Court in the decisions as referred to,

and cited above, it is well settled law that, if a party wishes to contradict the

record, he ought to file the necessary papers before the Court or Tribunal

of first instance, institute an inquiry before such Court or Tribunal, obtain

an order and thereafter, if aggrieved by that order canvas the matter in

the appropriate proceedings before the Court of Appeal. [Emphasis is mine]

However, it is significant to observe that in this matter no such effort was made

by the Appellant and its legal advisers to file an application with affidavits

before the High Court of Kandy and to seek to contradict or vary the record of

proceedings held by it on 02.09.2015.

Hence, it is abundantly, clear that in the instant case the Appellant had totally,

failed to comply with the proper procedure laid down in the decisions referred

to, and cited above. Where no such procedure is adopted, Justice Dias in King

vs Jayawardene at 503 laid down that the Court of Appeal should not take into

consideration self serving and convenient averments in an affidavit to

contradict or vary the record, and in this regard, Jayawardena, J. did not have

any reservations when he said in Jamal Vs. Aponso-2 Times Law Reports 215,

“I do not think that the record can be contradicted or impeached by affidavits”.

In the light of the above decisions, I am of the considered view that in the

instant appeal, the Appellant should not be allowed to contradict the record of

proceedings kept by the High Court of Kandy for the first time before this Court

for; if, the Appellant wishes to contradict the record, he ought to file the

necessary papers before the High Court of Kandy in the first instance, institute

an inquiry before it, obtain an order and thereafter if aggrieved by that order,

canvass the matter in the appropriate proceedings before the Court of Appeal,

in as much as it is not open to the Appellant to contradict the record of

proceedings before the High Court of Kandy for the first time before the Court

of Appeal.

CA/PHC/0125/2015

I would therefore, hold that the preliminary legal objection so raised by the

Respondents as to the maintainability of the instant appeal, is entitled to

succeed both in fact and law and as such, instant appeal should be dismissed

in-limine.

There is a further reason why this appeal cannot succeed both in fact and law

and it has in my opinion, a direct link with the preliminary legal objection so

raised by the Respondents as to the maintainability of the instant appeal and it

may now, be examined.

It becomes manifestly, clear that the Appellant seeks in the instant appeal, to

directly, canvas before this Court its legal validity and/or the legal propriety of

the order made by the learned High Court Judge dismissing the application in

revision filed before it by the Appellant for non-appearance of both the

Appellant as well as the Attorney-At-Law for the Appellant in Court on

22.09.2015 without first, purging his default in the court of first instance,

namely; the Provincial High Court of Kandy. Since, it appears to me to go to the

root of the appeal, which would if upheld, tend to dismiss the instant appeal in-

limine, I would now, propose to deal with it.

It is trite law that in the event of a Court making an order dismissing an action

for want of appearance of a party on a day appointed by it, it is open to any

party prejudiced to move the Court in an attempt to have it vacated and such

order may be vacated by Court on such terms as may be determined by it, if,

an application is made within a reasonable period of time and good causes

shown therefor.

However, it is significant to observe that the Appellant or his legal advisors had

not resorted to this ordinary method of rectification before the High Court of

Kandy.

Hence, It is my considered view that in the instant appeal, the Appellant

should not be allowed to canvas the order of the learned High Court Judge of

CA/PHC/0125/2015

Page 10 of 10

Kandy made by it dismissing the application in revision filed before it by the

Appellant for non appearance of both the Appellant as well as his Attorney-At-

Law on the day appointed by Court, namely; 22.09.2015 for the first time

before the Court of Appeal without first, purging his default before the High

Court of Kandy for; if, the Appellant wishes to have the order set aside, he

ought to file the necessary papers before the High Court of Kandy in the first

instance, institute an inquiry before it, obtain an order and thereafter if

aggrieved by that order, canvass the matter in the appropriate proceedings

before the Court of Appeal, in as much as it is not open to the Appellant to

canvas an order made by a High Court for his non appearance before it for the

first time before the Court of Appeal without first, purging his default before

the Court of first instance, which made the order sought to be impugned and

which dismissed the application in revision for his non appearance-as done by

the High Court of Kandy in this case.

I would therefore, hold that on the ground enumerated above, the instant

appeal, is not entitled to succeed both in fact and law and as such, the instant

appeal should be dismissed in-limine.

In view of the foregoing, I would hold that, the instant appeal is not entitled to

succeed both in fact and law.

Hence, I would proceed to dismiss the instant appeal with costs of this court

and the courts below.
