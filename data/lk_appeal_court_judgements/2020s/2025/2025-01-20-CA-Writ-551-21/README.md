JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The Counsels appearing for the Petitioners and the Respondents consented

to dispose this matter by way of Written Submissions.

The Petitioners instituted this Writ Application praying for the following

relief in the Petition dated 08.11.2021.

CA-Writ / 0551-2021

4 | P a g e

a) Issue notices on the Respondents;

b) Grant/Issue an order in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing

the order of 1st to 3rd Respondents marked as P-20(1), P-20(2) and

P-20(3).

c) Grant/Issue an interim relief in the nature of Writ of Prohibition to

the 1st and 10th Respondents to stop any steps taken to demolish the

construction on the Petitioners premises.

d) Grant costs.

This matter was supported on 15.11.2022 and based on the pleadings and

the circumstances of this case, this Court was inclined to issue notice on

the Respondents.

The learned Counsel for the 1st and 2nd Respondents gave an undertaking

that the subject building would not be demolished until the conclusion of

this application provided that the Petitioners would not engage in any

constructions at the subject premises. Further, the Petitioners had agreed

to discharge the 10th Respondent from these proceedings. Accordingly, the

10th Respondent was released from these proceedings.

The background of the case albeit as follows;

The 1st Petitioner became the owner of the land in which she is living by

Deed of Grant issued under Section 19(4) of the Land Development

Ordinance on 30.12.1996. The 2nd Petitioner was named as the Successor

of the land in issue by the 1st Petitioner with the approval of the Registrar

of Land, Polonnaruwa on 11.09.2020.

On 16.02.2020 the 2nd Petitioner lodged a complaint at the Polonnaruwa

Police Station followed by the incident of interruption of the private prayer

held at the Petitioners premises. There is an ongoing case filed against the

2nd Petitioner in the Magistrate Court of Polonnaruwa accusing that the 2nd

Petitioner is conducting prohibited religious activities.

CA-Writ / 0551-2021

5 | P a g e

On 10.02.2020 the 2nd Petitioner was summoned to the Divisional

Secretariat, Thamankaduwa to discuss about the religious activities

conducted at the Petitioners premises. Followed by the meeting above, the

Petitioner had received a letter dated 13.02.2020 from the Pradeshiya

Sabha, Polonnaruwa stating to stop further constructions on the

Petitioners premises and to obtain proper permission within 14 days for

such construction. A similar letter dated 14.02.2020 was also sent by the

Divisional Secretary of Thamankaduwa imposing similar restrictions as by

the Polonnaruwa Pradeshiya Sabha.

In addition to the letters mentioned above, the Petitioners had received

three more letters insisting that the Petitioners should obtain permission

for the ongoing contractions, permission to construct wall around the

Petitioners premises and to fulfill all necessary requirements sought by the

authorities.

As required by the authorities, the 2nd Petitioner had provided all necessary

documents and drawn a survey plan with the permission of the Divisional

Secretariat, Thamankaduwa to obtain the required permits.

After the submission of all necessary documents 2nd Petitioner received

three letters from Polonnaruwa Pradeshiya Sabha declining the request for

appropriate permission for constructions on the Petitioners premises on

the ground that the Petitioners have not fulfilled the requirement

mentioned in the letters dated 01.12.2020 which were sent by the

Polonnaruwa Pradeshiya Sabha. In the meantime, the Petitioners were

notified through a private lawyer on behalf of the Polonnaruwa Pradeshiya

Sabha to stop ongoing constructions at the Petitioners premises.

CA-Writ / 0551-2021

6 | P a g e

Now the Petitioners complain to this Court that the Respondents have

neglected their duties by not accepting the duly completed documents

submitted by the Petitioners and thereby abused their power by denying

the grant of rightful permit to continue constructions on Petitioners

premises.

The Respondents in their objections takes up the position that the

Nishshankamallapura Grama Niladri Division falls within the Urban

Development Area described under the order dated 30.07.2018 (Published

in the Extraordinary Gazette Number 2084/4 dated 14.08.2018) of the

Minister of Megapolis and Western Development. When considering the 2nd

Petitioners application 6R3 and the Building Plan 2020/BA/79-I, the

representatives of the 6th Respondent inter alia noted that there were

number of shortcomings in the Building Plan submitted by the 2nd

Petitioner and recommended to rectify such shortcoming and re-submit the

same. This was intimated to the 2nd Petitioner by letter marked as P16(a),

P16(b) and P16(c) by the 6th Respondent. As the 2nd Petitioner failed to

rectify the shortcomings mentioned in the letters P16(a), P16(b) and P16(c),

the Polonnaruwa Pradeshiya Sabha has sent P20(a) to P20(c) dated

25.02.2021 to the 2nd Petitioner informing him to rectify the shortcomings

in his documentation.

In response to P20(a) to P20(c) the Polonnaruwa Pradeshiya Sabha received

the Building Plan marked P18(c) from the 2nd Petitioner. As the 2nd

Petitioner not fulfilled the shortcoming highlighted by 1st Respondent, the

Planning Committee of the 1st Respondent did not approve P18(c) and this

was communicated to the 2nd Petitioner by letter marked as 6R8.

Although on 26.04.2022 the Planning Committee of the Polonnaruwa

Pradeshiya Sabha approved the Subdivision submitted by the 2nd

Respondent, but it did not approve the boundary wall application

CA-Writ / 0551-2021

7 | P a g e

submitted by the 2nd Petitioner since the 2nd Petitioner had failed to rectify

the shortcomings indicated in the letter marked as P16(c).

Although several dates were moved explore for a settlement in this case, on

26.08.2024 the parities informed Court that there is no settlement reached

by the parties.

The Panning Committee of the 1st Respondent had approved the

subdivision application on 26.04.2022 as the 2nd Petitioner had rectified

the shortcomings highlighted by the 1st Respondent. But the boundary wall

application was not approved by the Planning Committee of the 1st

Respondent as the 2nd Petitioner had failed to rectify the shortcomings

highlighted in the boundary wall application. Even though it was

communicated to the 2nd Petitioner by letter 6R12 dated 24.05.2022 the

Petitioners had not taken any meaningful action to submit the same after

rectifying the shortcoming highlighted.

The Petitioners in their written submission stated that they had fulfilled all

the requirements requested by the Respondent authority and yet the

Respondent authority has refused to grant the building plan permit to the

Petitioners stating irrational reasons. But the Petitioners had not

mentioned what was the action they had taken to remedy the shortcoming

highlighted in the boundary wall application. This clearly shows that the

Petitioners have not exhausted all the remedy available to them.

In Ishak v Laxman Perera, Director General of Customs 2003 (3) SLR-

page18 held that;

"Where there is an alternative procedure which will provide the

applicant with a satisfactory remedy the Courts will usually insist on

an applicant exhausting that remedy before seeking judicial review.

CA-Writ / 0551-2021

8 | P a g e

In this case, the Planning Committee did not approve the boundary wall

application submitted by the 2nd Petitioner as the 2nd Petitioner had failed

to rectify the shortcomings indicated in the letter marked as P16 (c). This

was not rectified by the 2nd Petitioner up to now.

As the application of the Petitioners is devoid of merit, this Court decided

to dismiss this application. No cost ordered.
