JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Accused-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

respondent) has been indicted in the High Court of Colombo in

case no. HC 3256/2021. The charge in the indictment is as

follows;

Page 3 of 11

That on or about the 1st of October 2010 at Colombo, the

respondent caused a cheque to the value of Rs. 825,000.00

to be dishonoured by dishonestly countermanding i.e.

terminating the duty of the bank to pay a cheque drawn

on him by the respondent, thereby committing an offence

punishable under section 25(1)(b) of the Debt Recovery

(Special Provisions) Act No.02 of 1990 as amended by the

Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 09 of 1994.

2. Upon the indictment being forwarded, the Learned High Court

Judge has caused the respondent to appear in Court and

thereafter caused the indictment with its annexures to be served

on the respondent.

3. When the case was called in Court on 07.09.2022, the Learned

High Court Judge has observed that criminal proceedings in

respect of a charge referred to in section 25 (1) of the Debt

Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 02 of 1990 (as amended)

should be instituted in the Magistrates Court and also directed the

appellant to satisfy Court that the trial against the respondent

could be proceeded with, in the High Court.

4. The appellant has tendered his written submissions on

20.10.2022 and raised a preliminary objection stating that a

criminal proceeding in respect of a charge referred to in section

25(1) Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No.02 of 1990 (as

amended) should be instituted in the Magistrates Court and that

Page 4 of 11

the High Court did not have the jurisdiction to try such a matter.

The complainant-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) has thereafter tendered his written submission on

01.12.2022.

5. The Learned High Court Judge by the order dated 27.04.2023,

has held with the respondent and proceeded to discharge him

from the proceedings in the High Court.

6. The appellant being aggrieved by the order of the Learned High

Court Judge dated 27.04.2023 has preferred the instant appeal to

this Court and prayed that the disputed order dated 27.04.2023

be set aside. The Learned Deputy Solicitor general has formulated

the following grounds of appeal on behalf of the appellant;

i. Does the Learned High Court Judge have jurisdiction

to question the validity of an indictment on his own

motion?

ii. Has the Learned High Court Judge erred in

determining that a charge relevant to committing an

offence under the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions)

Act should be tried in the Magistrate Court and that

the Attorney-General has no jurisdiction to forward

an indictment containing a charge under the said act

to the High Court?

Page 5 of 11

iii. Has the Learned High Court Judge misinterpreted

section 25(1) of the Debt Recovery (Special

Provisions) Act?

7. The Learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the

appellant has contended as follows;

i. That Article 140 of the Constitution confer in the Court

of Appeal the jurisdiction to issue orders in the nature

of writs, hence, the proper forum in which the legality

of an indictment could be challenged in is the Court of

Appeal.

ii. That section 393(7) of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act No. 15 of 1979 read together with sections 2 and 5

of such Act enabled the Attorney-General to forward an

indictment in the nature of the one in issue to the High

Court.

iii. That a special law will not override a procedural law.

8. The Learned Counsel for the respondent has disagreed with the

contention of the Learned Deputy Solicitor General. The Learned

Counsel for the respondent has contended that section 25(1) of

Page 6 of 11

the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No.02 of 1990 is not

overridden by section 393 (7) of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act No.15 of 1979 and that the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions)

Act is a special law.

9. The Learned High Court Judge on 07.09.2022, has observed that

criminal proceedings against the respondent should be instituted

in the Magistrates Court due to the nature of the charge.

Thereafter, has directed the appellant to satisfy Court that the

case involving the respondent could be proceeded with, in the High

Court. Subsequent to such direction, the respondent has tendered

written submissions before the appellant did and raised a

preliminary objection as referred to earlier. The Learned High

Court Judge has delivered the disputed order subsequent to such

preliminary objection being raised by the respondent. In those

circumstances, it is apparent that the Learned High Court Judge

has not on his own motion questioned the sustainability of the

indictment.

10. The Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No.02 of 1990 (as

Amended) contains five parts; the first to the fourth parts refer to

the recovery procedure in respect of monies lent and advanced by

lending institutions. Part V which contains sections 25 (1)(a) and

(b) constitute criminal responsibility in respect of any person.

Such criminal responsibility accrues when a person draws a

cheque knowingly that there are no funds, or a cheque is

dishonoured by a bank due to such cheque being dishonestly

Page 7 of 11

countermanded or there being no obligation on the banker to

make payment.

11. Such a case has been substantiated in Officer-in-Charge, CID vs.

Soris [2006] 3 SLR page 375 at page 381, N. Jayasinghe, J, has

stated,

We have considered the submissions of the learned Deputy

Solicitor General and Mr. Hussain. We are of the view that

section 25 (1)(a) is self-contained and exists devoid of any

ambiguity and given effect to, without resorting to any other

provision. We are also of the view that institution of an

action in Part I of the Debt Recovery Act has no relevance

whatsoever to a prosecution instituted under Section 25(1) of

the Act.

12. Hence, criminal responsibility has been established by the

creation of offences such as those stated in section 25(1) of the

Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act.

13. Further, a person accused of committing such an offence shall

be tried before a Magistrates Court and dealt with appropriately

after a summary trial in that Court. Though those offences as a

consequence could be categorised as summary offences, the

relevant section does not set out a special procedure in instituting

proceedings in a Magistrates Court. Thus, the procedure laid down

in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act will continue to be

Page 8 of 11

applicable, when instituting proceedings for a prosecution of an

offence in Part V of the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act.

14. Section 25(1) of the Debt (Recovery) Special Provisions Act No. 2

of 1990 is as follows;

Any person who,

(a) draws, a cheque knowing that there are no funds or

not sufficient funds in the bank to honour such

cheque; or

(b) makes an order to a banker to pay a sum of money

which payment is not made by reason of there being

no obligation on such banker to make payment or

by reason of the payment having countermanded;

or

(c) gives an authority to an institution to pay a sum of

money to itself, in payment of a debt or loan or any

part thereof owed to such institution, from, and out

of an account maintained or funds deposited, by

such person not placing adequate funds in such

account or by reason of the funds deposited having

been withdrawn by reason of such person

countermanding the authority given or by reason of

any one or more of such reasons; or

Page 9 of 11

(d) having accepted on inland bill dishonours it by non-

payment, shall be guilty of an offence under this Act

and shall on conviction by a Magistrate alter

summary trial be liable to punishment with

imprisonment of either description for a term which

may extend to one year or with fine of ten thousand

rupees or ten per centum of the full value of the

cheque, order, authority or inland bill in respect of

which the offence is committed, whichever is higher,

or with both such fine and imprisonment

15. I now draw my attention to section 393 (7) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 (as amended). It enables the

Attorney-General to forward an indictment directly to the High

Court in respect of any summary offence notwithstanding the

provisions contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act with

regard to the institution of an action in the Magistrates Court in

respect of a summary offence.

16. Section 393(7) of the Code of the Criminal Procedure Act No.15

of 1979 provides,

Notwithstanding any other provisions contained in this

Act, it shall be lawful for the Attorney-General, having

regard to the nature of the offence or any other

circumstances, in respect of any summary offence

(a) to forward an indictment directly to the High Court,

or,

Page 10 of 11

(b) to direct the Magistrate to hold a preliminary inquiry

in accordance with the procedure set out in Chapter

XV in respect of any offence specified by him where

he is of opinion that the evidence recorded at a

preliminary inquiry will be necessary for preparing

an indictment;

and thereupon such offence shall not be triable by a

Magistrates Court.

17. Further, a summary offence is interpreted to be as an offence

triable by a Magistrate Court [vide section 2 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Code Act No. 15 of 1979].

18. In Sellaiya Siribalan vs. The Attorney-General [CA (PHC) APN

09/2012 decided on 29.03.2012], Sisira de Abrew, J, held that,

When the above legal provisions are considered, I hold the

view that the Attorney General has the power to send an

indictment to the High Court in respect of a summary

offence (an offence triable by the Magistrate) and when

such an indictment is forwarded, the High Court Judge has

the power to hear, try and determine the case and that the

Magistrate loses jurisdiction to hear such a case.

19. Due to the aforesaid reasons, I set aside the disputed order dated

27.04.2023 and direct the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo

Page 11 of 11

to restore the case back into the Courts case roll, to cause the

respondent to appear before the High Court and proceed with the

trial to its conclusion.

20. I direct the Registrar of this Court to communicate this judgment

to the High Court of Colombo for compliance.
