Before : R. Gurusinghe J & M.C.B.S. Morais J

Counsel : Mahinda Nanayakkara

For the 1A Substituted Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner

Ranjan Senadheera

For the 2A and 4th Defendant-Respondents

Argued on : 25-10-2024

Decided on : 23-01-2025

R. Gurusinghe, J. The plaintiff-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff) filed an

action in the District Court of Galle, seeking to partition the land described

in the plaint. After trial, Learned District Judge of Galle entered the

judgment on 11-01-2008. Being dissatisfied by the said judgment, the 1st

defendant appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court of Galle. In the Civil

Appellate High Court of Galle, the parties came to a compromise on 01-08-

2014. All parties were represented by their respective Counsel. A Presidents

Counsel represented the 1st defendant-petitioner. The parties had sufficient

rights to enter into such a settlement. As per the settlement, the plaintiff

and the 1st defendant were entitled to 11 perches each, the 3rd defendant

was entitled to 3.404 perches and the 2A and 4th defendants were entitled to

1.269 perches.

The interlocutory decree was entered, as per the settlement entered in the

Civil Appellate High Court on 01-08-2014. Thereafter, a commission was

issued to a surveyor to prepare a final scheme of division of the land. The 1A

defendant participated in that inquiry before confirming the final scheme of

partition and gave evidence accepting the settlement entered before the Civil

Appellate High Court.

5

The 1st defendant died on 26-07-2017. In this application, the petitioner

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as 1A defendant) was the 5th defendant.

The 5th defendant was substituted in place of the deceased 1st defendant and

added to the caption as 1A defendant. Six years after entering the

settlement and participating in the subsequent proceedings, 1A defendant

filed this application before this court on 16-10-2020. There is no

acceptable explanation for such a long delay. Other than the 1A defendant,

no one else challenged the settlement.

The remedy of Restitutio-in-Integrum is an extraordinary relief granted to a

petitioner whose substantial rights were prejudiced or occasioned a failure of

justice. In addition, there must be exceptional circumstances that warrant

the intervention of this court.

In the case of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. v. Shanmugam and Another [1995] 1 Sri. L.R. Justice Ranaraja stated as follows;

Relief by way of Restitutio-in-Integrum in respect of judgments of original courts may be sought:

(a) where judgments have been obtained by fraud by the production of false evidence, non-disclosure of material facts or by force; or

(b) where fresh evidence has cropped up since judgments, which was unknown earlier to the parties relying on it or which no diligence could have helped to disclose earlier, or

(c) where judgments have been pronounced by mistake and decrees entered thereon provided, of course, it is an error which connotes a reasonable and "excusable error.

The remedy could, therefore, be availed of where an Attorney-at-Law has by mistake consented to judgment contrary to express instructions of his client, for in such cases, it could be said that there was, in reality, no consent but not where the Attorney-at-Law has been given a general authority to settle or compromise a case.

1A defendant in this application challenged the validity of the settlement

entered before the Civil Appellate High Court. However, the 1A defendant

6

had not pleaded any valid grounds, such as fraud or mistake, to set aside a

settlement entered before the Civil Appellate High Court. The 1A defendant-

petitioner pleaded vague grounds challenging the settlement. The 1A

defendant states that mandatory provisions of the partition law had not been

followed. However, he did not describe what provisions were not followed.

Again, 1A defendant states that the procedure followed in the instant

partition action per se is erroneous. However, he does not describe why he

takes up such a position or what errors have been committed. Again, he

says that the Civil Appellate High Court had incorrectly given shares to the

parties; however, he does not describe what should be the correct shares or

why he says the shares were given incorrectly. The 1A defendant-petitioner

put forward some other similar grounds; however, none of such grounds are

substantiated by the 1A defendant-petitioner.

It is to be noted that the first defendant was given 11 perches, and it was

conceded that she was given a share more than what she was entitled to.

The first defendant never challenged the settlement during her lifetime.

1A defendant has not stated that his rights were prejudiced in any way. The

rights of the 1st defendant were not prejudiced by the settlement at all. The

settlement was beneficial to the 1st defendant.

In the case of Hiniduma Dahanayakage Siripala alias Kiri Mahaththaya vs

Attorney General SC Appeal No.115/2014 decided on 22.01.2020, Aluwihare

PC. J. stated as follows:

21.With the promulgation of the 1978 Constitution, if relief is to be obtained in

an appeal, a party must satisfy the threshold requirement laid down in the

proviso to Article 138(1), which is placed under the heading The Court of

Appeal. The proviso to the said Article of the Constitution lays down that;

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be reversed or

varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced

the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice.

7

22.The proviso aforesaid is couched in mandatory terms, and the burden is on

the party seeking relief to satisfy the court that the impugned error, defect or

irregularity has either prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or has

occasioned a failure of justice. It must be observed that no such Constitutional

provision is to be found either in the 1948 Soulbury Constitution or the First

Republican Constitution of 1972. 23. The Constitutional provision embodied in

Article 138(1) cannot be overlooked and must be given effect to. None of the

decisions (made after 1978) relied upon by the Appellants with regard to the

issue that this court is now called upon to decide, appear to have considered

the constitutional provision in the proviso to Article 138(1). It is a well-

established canon of interpretation that the Constitution overrides a statute as

the grundnorm. All statutes must be construed in line with the highest law.

Judges from time immemorial have in their limited capacity, essayed to fill the

gaps whenever it occurred to them, in keeping with the contemporary times, in

statutes which do not align with the Constitution. However, such

interpretations are not words etched in stone.

The 1A defendant-petitioner failed to establish any exceptional

circumstances. The 1A defendant-petitioner failed to pass the threshold

requirement laid down in Article 138(1) of the Constitution to succeed in this

application. 1A defendant petitioners rights were not prejudiced. No other

party claims that their rights were prejudiced. The petitioner pleads no

ground accepted by law to set aside the settlement entered between the

parties. The settlement entered before the Civil Appellate High Court need

not be reversed or interfered with on account of any defect, error or

irregularity which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

For the foregoing reasons, the 1A defendant petitioner's application is

dismissed with costs. The petitioner filed this frivolous application to delay

the partition of the land. The 1A Defendant Petitioner is ordered to pay Rs.

40,000/- each as costs of this application to the Plaintiff-Respondent and

the 2A and 4th defendant-respondents.
