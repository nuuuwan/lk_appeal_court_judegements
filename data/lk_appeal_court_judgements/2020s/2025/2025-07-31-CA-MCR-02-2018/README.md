ORDER

This order derives from the findings and the direction given by His Lordship

Surasena J (as he was then) in the writ application case No. WRT-0335-17 made

on 09.07.2018. It is pertinent to give a brief description with regard to the writ

application WRT-0335-17.

The petitioner Cyril Rajapaksha has filed a writ application in this court seeking

to quash the document which was marked as P5 issued by the Agrarian

Development Authority, directing the petitioner to abstain from filling the

relevant extent of paddy land. The particular order made by the Commissioner

General of Agrarian Development, which the petitioner failed to obtain

permission. According to the petitioner, he obtained a permit on 20.02.2017.

Therefore, the petitioner prayed that notice sent by the commissioner is ultra

vires.

On the other hand, the learned state counsel has drawn the attention of the court

that the petitioner has not followed the proper procedure to obtain the said permit.

The court observed that the particular permit which the petitioner relied on had

not which has been issued without following the proper procedures. Thereafter,

the court has made the following decision.

Learned Counsel for the petitioner relied on the decision of the Magistrate's Court

dated 14.09.2017. This Court cannot agree with the finding of the learned

Page 4 of 5

Magistrate that the said permit is a permit issued according to law. Since the full

set of a copy of the relevant Magistrate's Court record has not been made available

to this Court, this Court decides to call for the relevant record from the

Magistrate's Court of Anuradhapura, peruse the same and then decide on a

suitable course of action to be taken with regard to the order dated 14.09.2017

pronounced by the learned Magistrate of Anuradhapura, in the exercise of the

revisionary jurisdiction of this Court at a subsequent occasion. This Court decides

on this course of action because this fact, which is a gross miscarriage of justice,

has now been brought to the notice of this Court through this case.

For the reasons set out above, this Court is of the view that the petitioner is not

entitled to succeed with this application. Therefore, this Court decides to refuse

this application and dismiss it with costs.

This Court directs the registrar of this Court to call for the record from the

Magistrates Court of Anuradhapura in case bearing No. 93515, open a separate

docket, assign a CA revision number and then have it mentioned before this Court

along with this application on 30.08.2018.

Thereafter, this revisionary application was forwarded by the registrar of this

court as directed. Subsequently, this court called for the original record from the

Learned Magistrate of Anuradapura. The portion of the disputed order which was

made on 14.09.2017 reproduced bellow.

.

33 (5) .

The Learned Magistrate has formed the opinion that the petitioner has obtained

a valid permit from the commissioner. But this court in Writ application

Page 5 of 5

WRT/0335/17, formed the opinion that the petitioner did not possess the title when

he claimed a permit and held that the 3rd respondent namely Sunil Weerasinghe

former Commissioner General of Agrarian Development had issued a false permit

without any basis for such an issuance.

For the said reasons, we revise and set aside the decision made by the learned

Magistrate on 14.09.2017.

We direct the Registrar to send this order along with the original Case record for

compliance.
