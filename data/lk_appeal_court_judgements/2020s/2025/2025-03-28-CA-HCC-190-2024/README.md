amended by Act No. 22 of 1995 and Act No. 29 of 1998.

2. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge has

convicted the appellant of the first and second charges and acquitted

him of the third. Thereafter, the Learned High Court Judge has

imposed the following sentence on the appellant;

Charge 1

A term of 15 years rigorous imprisonment together with a fine

of Rs.10,000 with a term of six months simple imprisonment in

default of the payment of the same.

4

Charge 2

A term of 15 years rigorous imprisonment together with a fine of

Rs.10,000 and a term of six months simple imprisonment in

default of the payment of the same.

3. The appellant aggrieved by the conviction together with the sentencing

order has forwarded the instant appeal to this Court.

Case of the prosecution

4. PW 01 has been 14 years old and studying in grade 8 when the

incidents referred to in the charges occurred. The first incident has

occurred when the appellant i.e. the father of PW 01 had taken her to

a jungle to pick cashews. On that occasion, the appellant has dragged

PW 01 further into the jungle and had intercrural sex with PW 01.

Three days later, when PW 01 was asleep at home, at around

midnight, the appellant has come to the place she was sleeping and

had intercrural sex with PW 01 once again.

Case of the appellant

5. The appellant has maintained that he was not mentally retarded to

have sex with his daughter. His narrative is that since his wife was

5

having an extra marital affair, the latter planned all of this, to mislead

the police and to imprison the appellant.

6. Grave sexual abuse is a profoundly disturbing issue that affects

individuals, families and communities. It violates the rights and

dignity of victims. Grave sexual abuse refers to the act of forcing or

coercing an individual into sexual activity. This abuse occurs in

various forms. In this instance, it has purportedly occurred in the

form of intercrural sex.

7. PW 01 the victim, has been 14 years old when the offences were

committed against her. She has been examined by PW 07, a judicial

medical officer, Dr. Sunil Hewage, several months after the incidents

took place. Further, her examination in court has taken place 12

years later. Given this considerable gap of time, any discrepancy in

the short history given to PW 07 or in her testimony can be

understood.

8. Firstly, it is important to recognise that the childs memory can be

highly malleable. At the age of 14, PW 01 would have been still

undergoing significant emotional and psychological development. Over

the years, her recollection of the traumatic incident may have been

influenced by various factors including changes in an environment,

6

personal experience and the natural process of maturing into

adulthood.

9. Additionally the passage of time can lead to fading memories and

altered perceptions of events. As the years pass, PW 01 may have

encountered information or perspectives that shape the

understanding of the incident

10. Moreover, the stress associated with recounting such a painful

experience in a public setting like a Court room could further

contribute to the inconsistencies in her testimony. It is also crucial to

consider the context in which she was examined 12 years after the

event. PW 01 in that instance would not only be confronting her past

but also navigating the complexities of the legal system. The pressures

of providing evidence in a formal setting can affect everyones ability to

recall details accurately.

11. PW01 has not initially disclosed to PW 02 the incidents of abuse she

experienced from the appellant. After some time, PW 01 has revealed

to PW 02 that she had been subjected to grave sexual abuse by the

appellant. PW 02 had also been in her early teens and known to PW

01 at that time. The delay in disclosure to PW 02 can be attributed to

the threats made by the appellant who created an environment of fear.

7

Subsequently, PW 02 has informed PW 03 who is the mother of PW

01. Upon learning about the allegations of grave sexual abuse against

the appellant, PW03 has promptly taken action to make a complaint

to the Police.

12. Recognising these factors is essential to ensure that justice is

served and that the perspective of PW 01 is given appropriate weight

in the legal process.

13. The contradictions and omissions that have been highlighted in

Court should be deemed immaterial, as they do not fundamentally

undermine PW 01s testimony or compromise the prosecutions case.

It is essential to recognise that while discrepancies may exist they do

not necessarily reflect a lack of credibility and reliability; instead it is

quite clear that they stem from the complexities of human memory or

the detailed nature of the events in question. Ultimately, these issues

should not distract from the comprehensive truth the prosecution

seems to establish.

14. In the pursuit of justice, the integrity of the PW 01s testimony is

paramount. However, a situation has arisen in which PW 01 has not

disclosed the exact date of the offences. This discrepancy, while

significant in some contexts should not strip PW 01 of a right to a fair

trial. It is essential to understand the implications of such

discrepancies and the broader principles of justice that must prevail.

8

It is crucial to recognise complexities around the recording of crimes.

PW 01 may face various psychological and emotional factors that may

inhibit her ability to recall specific dates accurately. Trauma, memory

distortion or fear of retribution can all contribute to PW 01s

uncertainty about when the offences occurred. Therefore absence of a

precise date should not be viewed as a lack of credibility rather it

highlights the need for sensitivity and understanding the judicial

process. Moreover, the cornerstone of a fair trial lies in the

comprehensive examination of all evidence presented, rather than

singular date. To dismiss a case solely due to an imprecise date

undermines the principal of justice and the potential for truth to be

revealed through crucial examination.

15. Further, though PW 01 has not disclosed the exact date of the

offences, it is apparent that the appellant has not been misled by such

discrepancy.

16. Section 166 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 is

as follows;

Any error is stating either the offence or the particulars

required to be stated in the charge and any omission to state

the offence or these particulars shall not be regarded at any

stage of the case as material, unless the accused was misled

by such error or omission.

9

17. In the decided case of D.R.M.Pandithakoralege (Excise

Inspector) vs. V.K.Selvanayagam 56 NLR 143, Swan, J, has

stated,

There can be no doubt that the accused was in no way

misled by the mistake as regards the date in the plaint. In the

case of William Edward James 1 it was held that a mistaken

date in an indictment, unless the date is of the essence of the

offence or the accused is prejudiced, need not be formally

amended. In the course of his judgment dismissed the appeal

the Lord Chief Justice referred to the judgment of Atkin J in

the case of Dossi 2 where it was held that from time

immemorial a date specified in an indictment has never been

considered a material matter unless time was of the essence

of the offence.

18. The appellant has argued that the prosecutions evidence reveal a

strong motive for false implication. This assertion is based on the fact

that PW 01 and PW 03 have brought the appellants alleged bad

character into the case, while PW 02 displayed a bias. Notably, the

abusive nature attributed to the appellant emerges during the cross-

examination rather than in the examination in chief. Importantly, the

Learned High Court Judge has not relied on this evidence to support

his conclusion.

10

19. The Learned High Court Judge has thoroughly evaluated the evidence

placed before Court at the trial taking into account the age and the

background of the witnesses. Further, the Learned High Court Judge

has also proceeded to carefully evaluate the background facts

presented during the trial. He has concluded that the prosecution has

provided compelling evidence that establishes a strong case against

the appellant through meticulous examination of witness testimonies,

expert reports and also that the prosecution has succeeded in creating

a coherent narrative that supports its allegations. Throughout this

process, the Learned High Court Judge has ensured that no undue

burden has been placed on the appellant.

20. In this instance, I shall now consider the principles relevant to the

evaluation of a dock statement. When evaluating dock statement, the

following guidelines must be considered;

i. A dock statement should be considered as evidence

subject to infirmities that it was not a sworn statement

and not tested by cross-examination.

ii. If the docks statement is believed, it must be acted upon.

iii. If the dock statement creates a reasonable doubt in the

prosecutions case, the defence of the accused must

succeed.

11

iv. The dock statement of one accused person should not be

considered against the other accused.

21. It is evident from the Learned High Court Judges disputed judgment

that he has carefully assessed the pertinent facts regarding why the

appellants dock statement failed to create a reasonable doubt about

the prosecutions case.

22. Moreover, even though the appellant has suggested his position to

PW 01 regarding the fact that this case was fabricated by PW 01 and

PW 03 because of the illicit affair of PW 03, the appellant has failed to

12

suggest such stance to PW 02. Also PW 01 and PW 03 have

categorically rejected the stance of the appellant.

23. In the case in hand, both PW 01 and PW 03 have explicitly rejected

the stance put forth by the appellant. Their testimonies indicate that

they do not find the arguments or suggestions put to them by the

appellant compelling. Also, the combined testimony of PW 01, PW 02

and PW 03 illustrates a clear consensus that challenges the credibility

of the appellants assertions leading to significant implications for the

overall case.

24. In those circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere with the

disputed judgment together with the sentencing order and dismiss the

appeal.

The Appeal is dismissed.

25. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate a copy of this

judgment to the High Court of Kurunegala for compliance.
