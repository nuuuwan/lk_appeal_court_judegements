JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) were indicted in the High Court of Kalutara under the following

count;

On or before 09.09.2003 at Delmulla North the Accused committed the

murder of Nekethralalage Gamini Shantha punishable under Section

296 read together with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

The Appellants had opted for a non-jury trial. The prosecution had called

PW1, PW2, PW3, PW9, PW10, and PW14 and marked several productions in

support of their case. When the defence was called, the 1st Appellant gave

HCC/CA/0131-133/22

3 | P a g e

evidence under oath while the 2nd and the 3rd Appellants made dock

statements and closed their case.

After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High

Court Judge had convicted the Appellants as charged and sentenced them

to death on 27.05.2022.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants have given consent for this matter to be argued in their absence.

Also, at the time of argument the Appellants were connected via Zoom from

prison.

The background of the Case albeit briefly is as follows:

PW1, who was an employee of the deceased at the time of the incident, had

accompanied the deceased and three others to a coming-of-age ceremony

held at the house of one Wimalaratne. They had arrived at the ceremony and

stayed under a canopy tent erected outside the house. After some time, the

deceased had gone into the house where the main function was in progress

to deliver a speech. At that time music was playing through a cassette player

for the guests, including the Appellants to dance. Both the canopy tent and

the house were properly lit within using electric bulbs. The deceased had

switched off the cassette player to deliver his speech. While delivering his

speech, the 1st Appellant had switched on the cassette player to continue

dancing. Again, the deceased had stopped the music to deliver his speech.

As the 1st Appellant once again switched on the cassette player and disturbed

the deceased, an argument ensued between the deceased and the 1st

Appellant. This had led to an exchange of swear words by the duo and it had

quickly escalated to a physical fight outside the house. Then PW1 had

witnessed the 1st Appellant stabbing the deceased several times using a knife

which he took from his waist. PW1 had further witnessed that after the 1st

HCC/CA/0131-133/22

4 | P a g e

Appellant stabbing the deceased, the 2nd and the 3rd Appellants had held the

deceased from his arms to facilitate the 1st Appellant to stab the deceased

further. Although he had run towards the 1st Appellant to apprehend him,

he had failed. Thereafter, he had taken the deceased to the Horana Base

Hospital where he was pronounced dead upon admission.

PW2, Nimalawathie, a relation of the deceased had corroborated the evidence

given by PW1 up to the quarrel which erupted between the 1st Appellant and

the deceased. However, she had not witnessed the stabbing, she had only

witnessed the deceased falling down on to the ground.

PW14, Uthpala Atigala, the JMO had given evidence on the postmortem

examination report prepared by Dr. H. P. Bandara (deceased). The JMO had

noted three injuries on the deceaseds body. First one is a deep cut injury on

the chest. Second and third are cut injuries on the skin. According to the

JMO, the first injury had caused the death of the deceased.

All three Appellants had been identified at the identification parade by PW1.

The grounds of appeal advanced by the 1st Appellant are as follows.

1. The learned Trial Judge has not considered the failure on the part

of the prosecution to establish the case beyond a reasonable

doubt.

2. The learned Trial Judge has not considered the failure on the part

of the prosecution to prove individual liability under Section 32 of

the Penal Code, in that the legal requirement of common

murderous intention was not considered by the Trial Judge.

3. The learned Trial Judge failed to consider the inter se and per se

inconsistencies in the evidence of PW1 and PW2.

4. That the learned Trial Judge failed to consider and analyze the

dock statements of the 2nd and the 3rd Appellants.

5. Does the judgment conform to the requirements of Section 283 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

HCC/CA/0131-133/22

5 | P a g e

The grounds of appeal advanced by the 2nd Appellant are as follows.

1. Has the prosecution proved the case against the 2nd Appellant

beyond a reasonable doubt?

2. Has the learned High Court Judge considered the question of

common intention in his judgment?

The grounds of appeal advanced by the 3rd Appellant are as follows.

1. Has the prosecution witnesses passed the test of credibility?

2. The Dock statement of the 3rd Appellant is not considered at all in

the judgment.

3. The question of common intention is not considered in the

judgment.

Considering the grounds of appeal raised by the Counsel, this Court has

decided to consolidate them as follows:

1. Has the prosecution proved the case against the Appellants beyond

a reasonable doubt?

2. Has the learned High Court Judge considered the legal requirement

of common intention in the judgment?

3. Has the learned High Court Judge considered the inter se and per

se contradictions in his judgment?

4. The learned High Court Judge has not considered the defense

evidence in its correct perspective.

5. Does the judgment conform to the requirements of Section 283 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

As the 1st and 3rd grounds mentioned under consolidated grounds are

interconnected, they will be considered jointly hereinafter.

HCC/CA/0131-133/22

6 | P a g e

Under the first and third grounds it is commonly argued by both the learned

Presidents Counsel appearing for 1st and 2nd Appellants and the Counsel

appearing for the 3rd Appellant that the prosecution has failed its duty by not

proving the case against the Appellants beyond a reasonable doubt. Further,

the evidence given by PW1 and PW2 contain inter se and per se

contradictions.

Eyewitness testimony stands as one of the paramount types of criminal

evidence, posing a challenging yet pivotal task for judges in evaluating

criminal cases. This often entails scrutinizing whether the witness's

narrative aligns with established facts of the case. However, direct

verification or falsification of such accounts may not always be feasible.

Consequently, judges must assess the reliability of the source.

Moreover, while an eyewitness's testimony holds significant sway in court

proceedings, its accuracy in numerous cases remain questionable. Evidence

suggests that erroneous eyewitness accounts can result in wrongful

convictions, leading individuals to serve extended prison sentences, and in

severe cases, to face capital punishment for crimes they did not commit.

When deliberating on eyewitness evidence, the court should consider various

factors, including the demeanour of the witness, the inherent plausibility of

the account, internal consistencies, consistency with prior statements,

potential biases, the compatibility of the account with crime scene evidence,

and corroboration from other witnesses. These considerations hold great

significance, especially considering that the burden of proof lies with the

prosecution in all criminal cases.

In Sumanasena V Attorney General [1999] 3 Sri L.R. at 137 Jayasuriya, J.

observed that;

In our law of evidence, the salutary principle is enunciated that

evidence must not be counted but weighed and the evidence of a single

solitary witness if cogent and impressive could be acted upon by a court

HCC/CA/0131-133/22

7 | P a g e

of law. Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance sets out that no particular

number of witnesses shall, in any case, be required for the proof of any

fact.

Witnesses are evaluated based on their credibility and reliability. Credibility

pertains to whether a witness is sincere and making genuine efforts to tell

the truth, or if they are trying to deceive or mislead the court. Reliability, on

the other hand, concerns whether the witness's memory or perception is

trustworthy and accurate.

PW1 in his evidence admitted that he was an employee working under the

deceased. But he had not provided any further information as to what sort

of work he did for the deceased. According to PW1, he had seen the 1st

Appellant stabbing the deceased about five times, but the medical evidence

does not support his version. Although PW1 and PW2 can be categorized as

Eyewitnesses there are glaring discrepancies and inconsistencies which

have been highlighted during the argument between the statements provided

by the two.

Although, PW1 took up the position that he, along with the others who came

with the deceased did not consume alcohol, according to the postmortem

report the JMO had detected the presence of alcohol in the deceaseds

stomach contents. Further, PW2 in her evidence admitted that the deceased

had consumed liquor. Hence, PW1s position contradicts the position taken

by PW2.

PW2 in her evidence did not mention that she witnessed the stabbing by the

1st Appellant. Further, in her evidence, she had categorically stated that she

saw nothing that the 2nd and the 3rd did to the deceased. She also said that

after the deceased collapsed, the people who accompanied the deceased

including PW1 were carrying knives in their hands. Further, PW1 had stated

that the people who accompanied the deceased were heavily intoxicated. Due

to the sudden fight situation, PW2 could not exactly tell the people who had

HCC/CA/0131-133/22

8 | P a g e

attacked the deceased and the people who were trying to rescue the

deceased.

Under these circumstances, in my view, the learned High Court Judge

should have considered these factors very carefully before arriving at his

conclusion. Neglecting this evidence had caused great prejudice to the

Appellants.

Next, I consider whether the learned High Court Judge had considered the

legal requirement of common intention in the judgment:

Section 32 of the Evidence Ordinance States:

When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the

common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in

the same manner as it were done by him alone.

In this case the Appellants were charged and convicted for murder, under a

common intention charge. Hence, it is the duty of the prosecution to adduce

evidence that two or more accused got together with the same intention and

actively participated in committing the offence. Hence it is the duty of the

trial judge to consider and analyze in his judgment the active participation

of each one of those Appellants separately in the commission of the offence

as the mere presence of the accused person is not sufficient to establish

common intention.

In King v Assappu 48 NLR 324 the court held that:

Where the question of common intention arises, the jury must be

directed in the following manner;

1. the case of each accused must be considered separately,

2. the accused must have been created by a common intention with

doer of the act at the time the offence was committed,

HCC/CA/0131-133/22

9 | P a g e

3. common intention must not be confused with same or similar

intentions entertained independently of each other,

4. there must be evidence, either direct or circumstantial of

prearrangement of some other evidence of common intention,

5. the mere fact of the presence if the accused at the time of the

offence is not necessarily evidence of common intention.

In Banda and others v Attorney General [1999] 3 SLR 168 the court held

that:

The learned trial Judge has used the term common intention only in

one solitary passage in his judgment. He has culpably failed to consider

the acts of participation on the part of each one of those accused

separately to analyse those acts and relate them to the principles of law

relating to common intention and having regard to their respective acts

to determine whether they were actuated by a common intention.

Hence, assumptions as to the reason of the Appellants presence at the party

on the day of the fatal incident is insufficient to prove the charge of murder

with common intention and the prosecution must provide cogent evidence in

order to prove the charge.

In this case, nowhere in his judgment has the learned Trial Judge explained

what common intention is and whether the Appellants had a common

murderous intention to commit the offence they were charged for. In his

judgment the learned High Court Judge had merely mentioned that the

evidence led at the trial supports the participation of all three Appellants.

(Page 409 of the brief). Therefore, the learned High Court Judge had failed to

consider and discover whether the ingredients of the charge against the

Appellants have been established beyond a reasonable doubt.

As per the 4th common ground of appeal, the learned Trial Judge has failed

to narrate the dock statements of the 2nd and the 3rd Appellants thereby

causing serious prejudice to them occasioning a deprivation of a fair trial for

the Appellants.

HCC/CA/0131-133/22

10 | P a g e

The Appellants have the right to a fair trial to determine whether they are

innocent or guilty which is an internationally recognised fundamental

human right. Fair trials help establish justice and are vital for everyone

involved in a case. They are a cornerstone of democracy, helping to ensure

the development of fair and just societies, and for the limiting of abuse

perpetrated by state authorities.

The profound duty of the trial court is to consider the evidence placed by the

prosecution and the defence on equal footings to arrive at its finding.

In R v. Hepworth 1928 (AD) 265, at 277, Curlewis JA stated:

A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim

the benefit of any omission or mistake made by the other side,

and a Judge's position in a criminal trial is not merely that of an

umpire to see that the rules of the game are applied by both sides.

A Judge is an administrator of justice, not merely a figure-head,

he has not only to direct and control the proceedings according to

recognised rules of procedure but to see that justice is done.

Upon perusal of the judgment delivered by the trial Judge in the case at

hand, it is manifestly clear that the learned High Court Judge had failed to

analyze the dock statements of the 2nd and the 3rd Appellants in a fair

manner and thereby had failed to provide a fair trial for them. The

importance of considering the dock statement had been discussed in several

judgments by the Superior Courts. However, its evidentiary value is less than

the evidence given from the witness box by an accused.

In Queen v. Buddharakkitha Thero 63 NLR 433 the court held that:

The right of an accused person to make an unsworn statement

from the dock is recognised in our law (King v. Vellayan[10 (1918)

20 N. L. R. 251-at 266.].) That right would be of no value unless

such a statement is treated as evidence on behalf of the accused

HCC/CA/0131-133/22

11 | P a g e

subject however to the infirmity which attaches to statements that

are unsworn and have not been tested by cross-examination.

In Queen v. Kularatne 71 NLR 529 the court held that:

We are in respectful agreement and are of the view that such a

statement must be looked upon as evidence subject to the

infirmity that the accused had deliberately refrained from giving

sworn testimony, and the jury must be so informed. But the jury

must also be directed that;

a) If they believe the unsworn statement, it must be acted

upon.

b) If it raised a reasonable doubt in their minds about the case

for the prosecution, the defense must succeed,

c) That it should not be used against another accused.

Upon the perusal of the judgment, it becomes evident that the learned trial

Judge had only narrated the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses.

The learned High Court Judge had failed to adequately analyze and evaluate

the dock statements of the 2nd and 3rd Appellants and its legal principles in

his judgment. Therefore, the judgment cannot be considered as a proper

judgment.

In our law the guidance pertaining to Judgement Writing is provided under

Section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 The Section

states:

The following provisions shall apply to the judgments of courts other than

the Supreme Court or Court of Appeal: -

(1) The judgment shall be written by the Judge who heard the case and

shall be dated and signed by him in open court at the time of

pronouncing it, and in case where appeal lies shall contain the point

or points for determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for

the decision.

HCC/CA/0131-133/22

12 | P a g e

(2) It shall specify the offence if any of which and the section of the law

under which the accused is convicted and the punishment to which

he is sentenced.

(3) If it be a Judgment of acquittal, it shall state the offence of which

the accused is acquitted.

(4) When a judgment has been so signed it cannot be altered or

reviewed by the court which gives such judgment:

Provided that a clerical error may be rectified at any time and that any

other error may be rectified at any time before the court rises for the

day.

(5) The judgment shall be explained to the accused affected thereby

and a copy thereof shall be given to him without delay if he applies for

it.

(6) The original shall be filed with the record of proceedings.

It is important for the judge who continues the case and pronounces the

judgment finally to adhere to this section in relation to Sub Section 283 (1)

CPC. Non-compliance with this Section provides a ground of appeal to the

Appellant who may then apply to an appropriate court for the delivered

judgment to be varied or even set aside.

Further, the mere outline of the case with re-production of the evidence of

both parties is not sufficient. Discussion of evidence is quite important as it

covers a major part of the judgment. This paves the way to come to a correct

conclusion on the question of facts.

In Thuranya v Pathaimany 15 CLW 119 the Court held that:

That a mere outline of the case for the prosecution and defence

embellished by such phrases as I accept the evidence for the

prosecution I disbelieve the defence is by itself an insufficient

HCC/CA/0131-133/22

13 | P a g e

discharge of the duty cast upon a magistrate by Section 306(1) of the

Criminal Procedure code.

In Jansz v Gregoris 04 NLR 359 the Court held that:

That a judgment drawn up under section 306 of the Criminal Procedure

Code should specify the offence, the section of the law under which the

conviction was had, the name of the accused, and the date of the

conviction.

Composing Judgments is seen as an essential part of a Judges duty and a

fundamental aspect of a Judiciarys function. A well-written judgment

ensures that justice is delivered fairly, transparently and provides clarity

about the rationale behind the verdict. A good judgment needs to be correct

on the facts as well as the law and as such, style and flair becomes merely a

secondary aspect. However, on the assumption that the judgment is correct

on the facts and the law, the presentation of the judgment is of considerable

importance. Therefore, the Judge must be mindful to take effort to do justice

in preparing and delivering such an impactful determination.

In Alexander Machinery (Dudley) Ltd. v. Crabtree (1974) LCR 120.it was

observed:

"Failure to give reasons amounts to denial of justice. Reasons are live

links between the mind of the decision taker to the controversy in

question and the decision or conclusion arrived at. Reasons substitute

subjectivity by objectivity. The emphasis on recording reasons is that if

the decision reveals the "inscrutable face of the sphinx", it can, by its

silence, render it virtually impossible for the Courts to perform their

appellate function or exercise the power of judicial review in adjudging

the validity of the decision. Right to reason is an indispensable part of

a sound judicial system, reasons at least sufficient to indicate an

application of mind to the matter before Court.

HCC/CA/0131-133/22

14 | P a g e

In Chandrasena and Others v. Munaweera 1998 (3) SLR 94 the court held

that:

The mere outline of the prosecution and defence without reasons being

given for the decision is an insufficient discharge of duty cast upon a

judge by the provisions of S.306(1).

In Karunadasa v. OIC Police Station, Nittambuwa (1987) 1 SLR 155 the

court held that:

Merely reciting the facts and giving no reasons for the judgment is

insufficient. The Magistrate must give reasons for his conclusions and

scrutinize the evidence led on behalf of the accused. Failure to give

reasons can occasion a failure of justice. An outline of the facts

embellished with phrases like "I accept the evidence of the prosecution",

'I disbelieve the defence" is insufficient to discharge the duty cast on the

prosecution. Section 283 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act makes

it imperative to give reasons in the judgment. The Magistrate has said

"the evidence of the witness called by the accused does not in any

manner help the defence. Therefore, I accept the evidence adduced on

behalf of the prosecution'. This shows that the Magistrate has given his

decision very largely on the weakness of the defence rather than on the

strength of the prosecution. It is an imperative requirement that the

prosecution must be convincing no matter how weak the defence is

before the court can convict. The weakness of the defence must not be

allowed to bolster up a weak case for the prosecution. The evidence

must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence. His innocence

is presumed by the law and his guilt must be established beyond

reasonable doubt.

In CA 34-35/2005 decided on 03/04/2007 Sisira De Abrew, J., held that:

In this case the Learned Trial Judge has merely narrated the evidence

of the prosecution witnesses without giving adequate reasons for the

HCC/CA/0131-133/22

15 | P a g e

conclusion and for the acceptance of the evidence of the prosecution

witnesses. In our view, a judgment devoid of adequate reasons for the

conclusion reached and a mere reproduction of evidence of witnesses is

not a judgment in the eyes of the law. We find that the judgment of the

Learned trial judge in this case is no judgment and would amount to

nullity.

According to the evidence presented by the prosecution, the exact root cause

which instigated the initial foul verbal exchange was due to the cassette

recorder being turned off, which was providing music to people who were

dancing and then the cassette recorder being turning back on when the

deceased was trying to deliver his speech. This argument between the

deceased and the 1st Appellant continued as the deceased had stopped the

cassette recorder for a second time. The argument had then turned in to a

sudden physical fight between the 1st Appellant and the deceased. Firstly,

according to PW2, the 1st Appellant had been beaten up by the deceased.

Thereafter, the fight had continued and ended with the deceased collapsing

on the ground. Evidence shows that all the Appellants took part in the

sudden fight.

Although the common grounds of appeal discussed above have merit, it is

prudent and reasonable that this matter should be considered under the

exception 4 to Section 294 of the Penal Code.

The exception 4 to Section 294 (Murder) of the Penal Code states as

follows:

Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden

quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or

acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

HCC/CA/0131-133/22

16 | P a g e

Explanation: - It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the

provocation or commits the first assault.

Section 297 of the Penal Code states as follows:

Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be

punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

extend to twenty years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by which

the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing

such bodily injury as is likely to cause death; or with imprisonment of either

description for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or with

both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death,

but without any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as

is likely to cause death.

In this case, the prosecution has brought sufficient evidence to prove that

the incident happened. But the evidence led at the trial was not sufficient to

support a murder charge. Under these circumstances, the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and the Constitution of our country provide

provisions to rectify any error, omission, or irregularity in a judgment where

such error, omission or irregularity which has not prejudiced the substantial

right of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice.

Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No: 15 of 1979 states as

follows:

Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgment

passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or

altered on appeal or revision on account-

(a) of any error, omission or irregularity in the complaint,

summons, warrants, charge, judgment, summing up or other

proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other

proceedings under this code; or

HCC/CA/0131-133/22

17 | P a g e

(b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135,

Unless such error, omission, irregularity, or want has

occasioned a failure of justice. [ Emphasis added]

Article 138 of The Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of

Sri Lanka states:

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to

the provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an

appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact

or in law which shall be [committed by the High Court, in

the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by

any Court of First Instance], tribunal or other institution

and sole and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal,

revision and restitutio in integrum, of all causes, suits,

actions, prosecutions, matters and things [of which such

High Court, Court of First Instance] tribunal or other

institution may have taken cognizance:

Provided that no judgment, decree, or order of any

court shall be revised or varied on account of any

error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced

the substantial right of the parties or occasioned a

failure of justice. [ Emphasis added]

Considering the Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and the

Article 138 of the Constitution, I consider it is appropriate and reasonable

that the learned High Court Judge should have decided the charge under

Section 297 (second limb) of the Penal Code. It is noteworthy to mention that

on 03.11.2008, proposal was made to consider this case under diminish

responsibility, but was not considered.

HCC/CA/0131-133/22

18 | P a g e

Therefore, the Appellants are acquitted from the murder charge but are

convicted under Section 297 of the Penal Code (Second Limb) and sentenced

as follows:

Each Appellant is sentenced to 03 years of rigorous imprisonment.

Each Appellant is imposed a fine of Rs.10,000/- with a default

sentence of 06 months simple imprisonment.

Each Appellant is ordered to pay a compensation of Rs.100,000/- to

the deceaseds family. In default 01-year simple imprisonment.

Finally, the sentence is back dated from date of sentence, i.e.

27.05.2022.

The appeal is allowed subject to the above variation in the sentence.

The Registrar is directed to send this judgment to the High Court of Kalutara

along with the original case record.
