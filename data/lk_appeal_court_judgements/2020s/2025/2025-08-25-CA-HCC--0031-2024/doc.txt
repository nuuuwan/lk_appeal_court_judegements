JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted by the Attorney General for

committing an offence under Section 354 and 365B (b) (2) (b) (Two Counts)

of the Penal Code that is, Kidnapping from lawful guardianship and Grave

Sexual Abuse respectively, on Mohamed Subair Farvin on 14.01.2006.

The trial commenced on 01/09/2022. After leading all necessary witnesses,

the prosecution had closed the case. The Learned High Court Judge had

called for the defence and the Appellant gave evidence from the witness box

and closed the case for the defence.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the evidence presented by

both parties, convicted the Appellant for the 1st and 2nd counts as per the

indictment and for the 3rd count, he was convicted under section 345 of the

Penal Code and sentenced as follows:

For the 1st count under section 354 of the Penal Code the Appellant was

sentenced to 4 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.5000/-. In

default, 3 months simple imprisonment was ordered.

For the 2nd count under Section 365B (b) (2)(b), the Appellant was sentenced

to 15 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10,000/- was imposed

subject to a default sentence of 06 months simple imprisonment. A

compensation of 250,000/- was ordered subject to a default sentence of 1-

year simple imprisonment.

For the 3rd count the learned High Court Judge found the Appellant guilty

under section 345 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to 4 years rigorous

imprisonment with a fine of Rs.5000/-. In default, 3 months simple

imprisonment was ordered. Additionally, a compensation of Rs.200,000/-

was ordered with a default sentence of 1-year simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid convictions and sentences, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. During the argument

he has been connected via Zoom platform from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the test of probability

and improbability of the testimony of PW1 in convicting the Appellant.

2. The prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.

3. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to evaluate the inter se and per

se contradictions which have arisen from the evidence of the

prosecution witnesses.

4. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the defence evidence in

the light of the evidence adduced on behalf of the Appellant.

5. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the evidence which is

in favour of the Appellant.

Before commencement of the argument, as a preliminary issue, the Learned

Counsel for the Appellant took up the matter of convicting the Appellant

under Section 345 of the Penal Code for which he was not indicted in the

CA/HCC/0031/24

4 | P a g e

indictment. He contended that the 2nd count and the 3rd count in the

indictment arise on the single sexual act committed by the Appellant.

Therefore, the Counsel argues that convicting the Appellant for count two

and three are improper and caused great prejudice to the Appellant.

The Learned Deputy Solicitor General (hereinafter referred to as the DSG)

having considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the Appellant,

moved time to consider the argument advanced by the Appellants Counsel.

When this matter resumed on 17.07.2025, the learned DSG informed the

Court that given the facts and the circumstances that led to the conviction

and other incidental matters, that she will not be contesting the sentence

passed on the 2nd count by the learned High Court Judge of Ampara.

The Facts of this case albeit briefly are as follows.

The victim was 08 years old and was schooling at the time of the incident.

The Appellant is a relative of the victim and according to the relationship, he

is known as her uncle.

On the day of the incident, the Appellant left the house with the victim with

her mothers permission to see the Oluvil Harbour and thereafter to go to the

Appellants house in Ampara. Both rode on the Appellants motor bike.

Whilst on their way and under the guise of showing her some elephants, the

Appellant had parked his motor bike in a forest area and after making her to

sit on the motor bike, had kissed her face. A villager who had observed this

incident had warned them to leave the place immediately. Thereafter, the

Appellant had taken the victim to a hilly area, made her lie atop a rock,

removed her undergarment and kissed her again. At that time, about six

villagers accompanied by a police officer had arrested the Appellant and

handed him over to the Buddhangala Police Post. Thereafter, both had been

taken to the Ampara Police Station and an investigation has been conducted.

The Appellant had been a police officer by profession at that time.

5 | P a g e

The learned Counsel for the Appellant, in view of the stance taken by the

learned DSG in respect of count two, now rests his argument on the sentence

pronounced on counts one and two.

Considering the facts of the case and the submissions made by both Counsel,

I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on count two in the

indictment. The learned DSG also admitted that the 2nd and 3rd counts arise

from a single sexual act committed by the Appellant. Therefore, he is

acquitted from count two of the indictment. I affirm the conviction and

sentence imposed on count one and count three. Considering all the

circumstances of the case, I consider it is appropriate to order the sentence

imposed on count one and count three to run concurrent to each other from

the date sentence, i.e. 11.08.2023.

Subject to above variation, the appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgement to the High

Court of Ampara along with the original case record.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

R.P.Hettiarachchi, J,

I agree.
