JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

Thirteen individuals, including the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 8th Accused-Appellants, were indicted

before the High Court of Trincomalee on 37 charges. The case was subsequently transferred

to the High Court of Anuradhapura. At the time the indictment was served, the 7th Accused

had passed away. A trial in absentia was ordered for the 1st Accused. Pursuant to an

application made by the Attorney General under Section 194(1) of the Criminal Procedure

Code, the 9th to 13th Accused were acquitted.

The Prosecution presented evidence from 36 out of the 78 listed witnesses and tendered

documents and productions marked P1 through P28 before closing its case. Subsequently,

the Defence was invited to present its case, during which the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 8th

Accused made dock statements and called two witnesses in support of their defence.

Upon conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge delivered judgment on 26th April

2024. The 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 8th Accused were found guilty on the first count of the

indictment and were accordingly sentenced to life imprisonment. They were acquitted of all

remaining charges. Additionally, the 3rd and 6th Accused were acquitted of all counts in the

indictment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction, the Accused have preferred an appeal to this Court,

setting out the following grounds in support of their challenge.

1. Judgment is against the weight of evidence and is contrary to the law

2. The High Court Judge erred in law by receiving evidence on a faulty indictment, on

two separate unlawful assemblies contrary to the rules of joinder of charges

3. The High Court Judge erred in law by convicting the appellant when there was no

evidence in relation to the constitution of an unlawful assembly

4. The High Court Judge misdirected himself and erred in law by his failure to apply the

legal principles in relation to elements of unlawful assembly

5. The High Court Judge failed to consider and erred in law, as the prosecution had

failed to lead evidence of unlawful assembly

Page 5 of 15

6. The High Court Judge erred in law by his failure to consider that the appellant had a

reason to be present at the scene.

7. The High Court Judge misdirected himself and erred in law on the object of unlawful

assembly when the appellant had not subscribed to any unlawful object

8. The High Court Judge had misdirected himself on the burden of proof

9. The High Court Judge had failed to evaluate and adduce proper reasons for rejecting

the dock statements.

The Learned Counsel for the Accused primarily contended that the Prosecution had not

established that they all possessed a shared common object at the time the alleged offences

were committed. That is to say, not all of the accused were present at the time of the incident.

It is important to note that their convictions were limited solely to the offence of unlawful

assembly.

The facts and circumstances of the case are summarised as follows

PW 03, Arumugam Nithya, testified that gunfire was heard from nightfall and continued into

the following morning. She stated that her brother, Arumugam Segar (deceased), and her

brother-in-law, Ponnambalam Kanakasabe (deceased), were abducted by a group of masked

individuals and taken in the direction of a checkpoint located near their residence. Their

bodies were later discovered inside a container. The witness confirmed that she was unable

to identify any of the accused among those present on that morning.

PW 01, Ponnadure Kamawachchi Pille, stated that her son had gone to a neighbours house,

where he was abducted and subsequently murdered by unidentified individuals. PW 04,

Udayakumar Jayakumari, testified that during a gathering held to celebrate their move into

a new residence, armed individuals entered the premises the following morning around 6.00

a.m. and abducted six men. The bodies of the abducted individuals were later found deceased.

The witness also confirmed that she was unable to identify any of the perpetrators.

All three witnesses were unable to identify any of the accused as being among those

responsible for the incidents described.

According to the testimony of Prosecution Witness (PW 37), Rathnayaka Musiyanselage

Nawarathna Bandara served as a Reserve Police Constable and was stationed at the

Page 6 of 15

Bharatipuram checkpoint on 31 January 1998. He stated that gunfire was directed from the

jungle area over the checkpoint beginning at nightfall and continuing into the early hours of

the following morning. The police returned fire, and no injuries were reported during the

exchange.

Reinforcements arrived around 5:30 a.m., including PW 78 (Headquarters Inspector of

Kantale), the 4th Accused, and subsequently the 2nd Accused. PW 37 was positioned near a

Nuga tree directly opposite the checkpoint, from where he had a clear and unobstructed view

of the area. Between 7:00 and 7:30 a.m., the 2nd Accused brought two civilians clad only in

sarongs from the direction of Pokkurani and seated them near the checkpoint. These

individuals were then placed under the custody of the 4th Accused, who proceeded to

interrogate them. The 2nd Accused was not present during this questioning.

He later observed the civilians being dragged behind the checkpoint by a man dressed in

civilian clothing, whose identity he could not ascertain and who was not among the accused

present in court. Shortly thereafter, the witness saw the two civilians lying dead in a pool of

blood behind the checkpoint. The witness further noted that several armed police officers

were present at the scene, many of whom were dressed in civilian attire.

During cross-examination, PW 37 confirmed that both PW 78 and the 4th Accused were

present together in the tea pantry. When questioned by Learned Counsel regarding an

alleged omission in his police statement, specifically, that he had not mentioned the 4th

Accused interrogating the two civilians, the witness firmly asserted that he had indeed

included that detail.

PW 37 also noted the presence of an unidentified individual at the scene, although the

indictment makes no reference to any such "unknown person." Upon reviewing the evidence,

PW 37s testimony describes the 2nd Accused bringing a civilian and handing him over to the

4th Accused. This was followed by an unidentified person who arrived with the two deceased

civilians and subsequently shot and killed them. There is no evidence to suggest that the 1st,

5th and 8th Accused were present at the time of the incident.

Page 7 of 15

PW 38, Goramba Devayalaage Sunil Priyantha Jayaratna, also a Reserve Police Constable

stationed at the Bharatipuram checkpoint, corroborated PW 37s account of the attack and

the arrival of reinforcements from the Kanthale Police Station and nearby posts. The

reinforcement team included the 2nd, 4th, and 8th Accused, as well as PW 78. A significant

number of additional officers were also present to assist.

PW 38 testified that he saw the 5th Accused escort two civilians to the checkpoint. These

individuals were then taken to Room No. 01 by the 2nd Accused, in the presence of the 4th

Accused. He further stated that the civilians were restrained on a mattress. According to PW

38, the 1st Accused later removed one of the civilians from the room, took him to the rear of

the checkpoint, and shot him from behind. The 1st Accused then returned to the room

occupied by the 4th Accused, and shortly thereafter, took the second handcuffed civilian to

the same location and shot him as well.

Subsequently, the witness testified that the 8th Accused, accompanied by unidentified

officers, brought another group of civilians to the checkpoint. While the witness stepped away

to drink tea, he heard gunshots and later discovered three more civilian bodies. Although he

confirmed the presence of the 8th Accused at the scene, he did not identify any other accused

individuals in connection with this incident.

Upon reviewing the evidence, it is clear that the witness's testimony specifically confirms the

presence of only the 1st and 5th Accused. No other individuals named in the indictment were

identified by the witness, and there is no indication that all four accused were present

together or arrived at the scene simultaneously. The Learned High Court Judge duly noted

that, according to the witness, the 5th Accused was not present at the time the shootings

occurred.

During cross-examination, the credibility of the witnesss account regarding the 8th Accused

was challenged, leading to a dispute between the accused and the witness. The witness,

however, firmly denied any inconsistencies in his testimony.

According to the testimony of PW 48, he was instructed by an officer dressed in civilian attire

to escort the civilians to the rear of the checkpoint, a directive he refused to comply with.

Page 8 of 15

Later, he heard single gunshots emanating from behind the checkpoint and subsequently

observed that the civilians had been killed at that location.

PW 78, Wasantha Nanda Kumara Silva Wijayawantha Wickremasinghe, who held the

position of Headquarters Inspector (HQI) of Kantale, identified the 5th Accused as the

Officer-in-Charge of the Thambalagamuwa police checkpoint. They have gone to the

checkpoint because they got information regarding a terrorist attack. But he has not seen

any incident at that point.

As the witness approached the Bharathipuram police checkpoint, he reported hearing

gunfire. He remained at the location for roughly two hours, during which he encountered no

individuals but continued to hear shots being fired from behind the checkpoint. Once the

gunfire ceased, he emerged to find seven bodies near the police post and an additional body

on the opposite side of the road.

All 4 accused denied the charge against them. The Learned High Court Judge acquitted all

the accused of every charge except for the first count, which pertains to the offence of

unlawful assembly. It is therefore pertinent to reproduce the particulars of the first count for

clarity and context.

The charge sheet contains no express reference to any individuals, other than the named

accused, being part of the alleged unlawful assembly, nor does it suggest the involvement of

Page 9 of 15

persons unknown to the prosecution. Accordingly, it was incumbent upon the prosecution to

establish that the named accused in the indictment were themselves members of an unlawful

assembly formed with the common object of committing murder.

Accordingly, it was incumbent upon the prosecution to establish that the identified

individualsnamely the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 8th accusedwere the actual participants in

the alleged unlawful assembly, as others were acquitted of the charges by the Learned High

Court Judge. Through the testimony of Prosecution Witnesses Nos. 36 and 37, the 1st, 2nd,

4th, 5th, and 8th accused were identified. Notably, PW 38 stated that the 8th accused arrived

at the scene at a later stage. However, there is no evidence to suggest that all the Accused

namely the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 8th accused, were present at the time the 1st accused allegedly

shot and killed the civilians.

Despite this evidentiary gap, the Learned High Court Judge concluded that all five accused

were members of an unlawful assembly. The principal contention raised by the accused-

appellants is that the Learned Judge misdirected himself in arriving at this conclusion,

particularly in the absence of evidence demonstrating the simultaneous presence of all the

accused at the time of the shooting. While it is true that a witness observed the 1st accused

escorting and shooting the civilians, the critical issue remains whether the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and

8th accused, without direct evidence of their participation in the group at the material time,

could be said to have shared the common object of committing murder.

The question is whether the prosecution successfully established the existence of an unlawful

assembly in the present case. To assess this, we examine key scholarly commentary and

relevant judicial precedents that define its essential elements.

Dr. Sir Hari Singh Gours Penal Code of India, 11th Edition, Volume 4, at page 1296;

8. Mere presence in assembly not sufficient.

All persons who convene or who take part in the proceedings of an unlawful assembly

are guilty of the offence of taking part in an unlawful assembly. Persons present by

accident or from curiosity alone without taking any part in the proceedings are not

guilty of that offence, even though those persons possess the power of stopping the

Page 10 of 15

assembly and fail to exercise it. Mere presence in an assembly does not make such a

person a member of an unlawful assembly unless it is shown that he had done

something or omitted to do something which would make him a member of an

unlawful assembly, or unless the case falls under Sec. 142, I.P.C. It would appear that

the place of occurrence is surrounded on all sides by the houses of appellants. If

members of the family of the appellants and other residents of the village assembled,

all such persons could not be condemned ipso facto as being members of that unlawful

assembly. It would be necessary, therefore, for the prosecution to lead evidence

pointing to the conclusion that all the appellants had done or been committing some

overt act in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly. Where the

evidence as recorded is in general terms to the effect that all these persons and many

more were the miscreants and were armed with deadly weapons, like guns, spears,

pharsas, axes, lathis, etc. this kind of omnibus evidence has to be very closely

scrutinized in order to eliminate all chances of false or mistaken implication. Simply

because certain members are present in a crowd at the time of a riot by the certain

members of their community, it cannot be said that they also, who used no violence,

were guilty of the riot.

Further His Lordship Weerasuriya J in Samy and Others v. Attorney General, 2007 (2) SLR

216, at page 226, held that;

It is well settled law that mere presence of a person in an assembly does not render

him a member of an unlawful assembly, unless it is shown that he has said or done

something or omitted to do something which would make him a member of such an

unlawful assembly or where the case falls under section 139 of the Penal Code. Dr.

Gour in Penal Law of India discusses the law in respect of unlawful assembly as

follows: (Vol I page 1296-11th Edition) "All persons who convene or who take part in

the proceeding of an unlawful assembly are guilty of the offence of taking part in an

unlawful assembly. Persons present by accident or from curiosity alone without

talking any part in the proceedings are not guilty of that offence, even though those

persons possess the power of stopping the assembly and fail to exercise it.

Page 11 of 15

The issue is further elucidated in the following passage extracted from Ratanlal and

Dhirajlal, The Law of Crimes, Ninth Edition, at page 321."

2. 'Common object.-The essence of the offence is the common object of the persons

forming the assembly. Whether the object is in their minds when they come together,

or whether it occurs to them afterwards, is not material. But it is necessary that the

object should be common to the persons who compose the assembly, that is, that they

should all be aware of it and concur in it. It seems also that there must be some

present and immediate purpose of carrying into effect the common object; and that a

meeting for deliberation only, and to arrange plans for future action is not an unlawful

assembly.

Prof. G.L. Peiris in Offences Under the Penal Code of Sri Lanka on page 36:

There are three basic elements in the definition of an unlawful assembly in our law.

These relate to (a) the number persons constituting the assembly; (b) the existence of

a common object among the members of the assembly; and (c) the nature of the

common object.

The foregoing principle has been examined and applied in the following judicial decisions.

In Rex v. Dias, Ceylon Law Record Volume 17, page 16, at page 18, His Lordship Soertsz, J

held that:

The offence of being a member of an unlawful assembly is an offence that can be laid

against each of five or more persons who come together with any of the objects

enumerated in the Section of the Penal Code constituting the offence and once there

is evidence to show that there were five or more people assembled with the objects

referred to, an indictment can be presented against any one of them on the footing

that he was a member of an unlawful assembly and that in that capacity he committed

the offences he is charged with. Surely, such an accused person cannot take advantage

of the fact that his associates were unidentified and contend that as he alone was

identified, it cannot be said that he was a member of an unlawful assembly. It is purely

a question of fact whether there was an unlawful assembly or not, and again it is

purely a question of fact who the units of that unlawful assembly were.

Page 12 of 15

In Police Sergeant Kulatunga v. Mudalihamy, 42 NLR 33, His Lordship Chief Justice Howard

held that:

Both charges involved the proof of an unlawful assembly. It had, therefore, to be

proved by the prosecution that there was an unlawful assembly with a common object

as stated in the charges. So far as each individual accused was concerned it had to be

proved that he Was a member of the unlawful assembly which he intentionally joined.

Also that he knew of the common object of the assembly.

In Andrayas v. The Queen, 67 NLR, 425 at page 430, His Lordship Justice T. S. Fernando

held that:

It was, in our opinion, necessary for the trial judge to have given an adequate

direction to the jury that mere membership of an unlawful assembly did not render

each member of that unlawful assembly criminally liable for an offence committed by

some other member thereof. It was not, in our opinion, a correct direction of the jury

that mere membership of an unlawful assembly, without more, rendered each member

of that unlawful assembly criminally liable for an offence committed by some other

thereof. Such liability arose at law only when the existence of a certain other element

or elements specified in section 146 of the Penal Code had been established.

In the recent case of Samy and others v. Attorney General (Supra), it was held that;

Therefore, the vital ingredient of the offence of being a member of an unlawful

assembly is the intention to join the assembly with a particular common object. The

onus of proving the ingredient lies on the prosecution.

It is noted that the appellants, namely the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 8th accused, were acquitted of

the additional charges relating to murder and abduction committed with the common

intention to murder. However, the Learned High Court Judge concluded that the prosecution

had successfully established that these accused were active participants in an unlawful

assembly, formed with the common object of committing the murder.

The central question is whether there is sufficient evidence to establish that all the accused

were present at the time of the incident. Only then can it be inferred that they shared a

Page 13 of 15

common object. Although the Learned High Court Judge formed the view that the accused

were members of an unlawful assembly with murder as its common object, he nevertheless

acquitted them of the charge of murder committed in furtherance of that unlawful assembly.

The reasons for this conclusion were set out as follows:

Page 1216 of the brief;

.

According testimonies of PW37 and PW38, it is evident that the prosecution has failed to

establish that the Accused acted in concert as members of an unlawful assembly with a

shared common object to commit murder. The evidence presented reflects a series of discrete

and uncoordinated actions by the individual Accused, devoid of any indication of collective

intent.

In fact, the Learned High Court Judge has observed that the gathering was for a lawful

purpose at first, namely, to protect against a potential terrorist attack.

On Page 1213 of the brief;

.

From the foregoing observations, it is evident that the Learned High Court Judge concluded

that, at the time of the killing of the civilians, there was no evidence establishing the presence

Page 14 of 15

of the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 8th accused. It is noteworthy, however, that under the first count of

the indictment, their conviction was based on the allegation that they were members of an

unlawful assembly, the common object of which was to commit murder. For an unlawful

assembly to be constituted, there must be five or more individuals present at the relevant

time. The question is whether they were assembled together at the time of the incident.

Further, he has stated that the 2nd Accused took the civilians to the checkpoint, and then an

unknown person took them to the backside of the checkpoint. We note that the presence of

an unknown person was noted; however, the first charge of the indictment contains no

reference to any "unknown person."

On Page 1214 of the brief;

The Learned High Court Judge considered the fact that the 1st Accused escorted the civilians

to the rear of the checkpoint and shot both of them. It is noted that the 1st Accused was

absent throughout the trial proceedings, and accordingly, no defence was presented on his

behalf.

Accordingly, the Learned High Court Judge further observed that the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and

8th accused were engaged in an unlawful assembly. However, it must be noted that there is

no evidence establishing that all five accused were present at the time the killings occurred.

There is no evidence establishing that all the accused were present at the time of the

incident. It is therefore submitted that the Learned High Court Judge misappreciated

the factual matrix and arrived at a conclusion that is legally unsustainable.

We hold that the Learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself in applying the

legal principles governing unlawful assembly, having failed to appreciate that the

prosecution did not lead any cogent or credible evidence establishing the existence of

such an assembly as defined in law. There was no other evidence to establish all were

present at the time of the incident or that they shared an unlawful object or

coordinated conduct, which falls short of the statutory threshold.

For the said reasons, we set aside the conviction and the sentence against the said

Accused imposed on 26.04.2024.

Appeal is allowed.
