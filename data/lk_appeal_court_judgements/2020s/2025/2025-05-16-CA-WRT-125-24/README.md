JUDGEMENT

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J. 1. The 1st petitioner is a company incorporated under the Companies

Act, and the 2nd, 3rd and 4th petitioners are directors of the 1st

petitioner company. The 1st petitioner had obtained four facilities

from the 1st respondent bank. 1st respondent is a duly incorporated

banking institution and is a licensed commercial bank within the

meaning of the Banking Act and the Recovery of Loans by Banks

(Special Provisions, Act No. 4 of 1990).

2. It is common ground that the 1st petitioner is a customer of the 1st

respondent bank and has obtained the following facilities:

i. a permanent overdraft of Rs. 50 million;

ii. a letter of credit (sight) of Rs. 100 million;

iii. a revolving import loan of Rs. 35 million; and

iv. a term loan of Rs. 200 million.

3. The 1st petitioner failed and neglected to make payment and

defaulted in servicing the said facilities. Thereupon, on the request

of the 1st petitioner, the outstanding amounts of the said financial

facilities were restructured.

4. The 1st petitioner accepted the offer letter dated 05.06.2018 (P-4) and

the following facilities were offered on terms and conditions listed in

the said letter:

i. a term loan No. I of Rs. 200 million;

ii. a term loan No. II of Rs. 85 million; and

iii. a term loan No III of Rs. 29 million.

5. Upon so accepting, the 1st petitioner entered into three separate loan

agreements (vide P-5 (i) P-5 (iii)). As security for the said financial

facilities the petitioners executed six mortgage bonds marked P-6 (i)

WRT/0125/24

Page 5 of 17

P-6 (vi) along with declarations under Section 47A of the Mortgage

Act.

6. As the 1st petitioner once again defaulted and the 1st respondent

bank upon duly demanding the payment and following the due

process embarked upon to recover as provided for the Recovery of

Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act, No. 04 of 1990 (hereinafter

also referred to as the Act). Acting under the provisions of the said

Act, the Board of Directors of the 1st respondent bank resolved to

auction to said properties mortgage by resolution dated 28.01.2019.

The same was duly published in the Government Gazette dated

15.03.2019 and also published in newspapers of 13,03.2019 in all

three languages. The resolution has also been conveyed to the

petitioners in accordance with Section 08 of the Act by letter dated

29.04.2019.

7. The public auction of the said property was fixed for 23.08.202 and

the notice of auction was published in the Government Gazette on

30.07.2021 and in newspapers in all three languages. The plaintiffs

were also duly informed of the same along with copies of the Gazette

notification and newspaper publications.

8. The petitioners then filed action in the Commercial High Court

bearing No. Civil 197/2021/ MR in August 2021 challenging the said

resolution and inter alia also sought interim relief to stay the

auction. Interim injunction sought was not granted and then the 1st

petitioners entered into a settlement with the 1st respondent bank.

The terms of settlement as agreed was tendered to court. The of

settlement dated 16.06.2022 (P-10) as agreed was so entered and

the proceedings were accordingly terminated.

9. The said terms of settlement have spelt out the mode of the payment

and instalments in respect of the amounts outstanding. This is no

WRT/0125/24

Page 6 of 17

more than a rescheduling of the outstanding amounts. Then

paragraph 10 of P-10 specifically provides that in the event of the

default of any two instalments the respondent bank is entitled to

proceed with the resolution adopted on 28.09.2019 and to sell the

property by a public auction.

10. The 1st petitioner failed to duly make payment and defaulted. The 1st

respondent bank in of in accordance with the agreed terms of the

settlement, proceeded to give notice of sale in accordance with Section

9 of the Act. The notice of auction was published in the Government

Gazette on 02.02.2024 (R15) and in newspapers in all three languages

(R16a-16c). The plaintiffs were also duly informed of the same along

with copies of the Gazette Notice and newspaper publications by letter

dated 09.02.2024 (R17c). The public auction was scheduled for

27.02.2024.

11. The petitioner has now preferred this application primarily seeking to

quash a resolution adopted by the 1st respondent bank on 28.01.2019

and also quash the decision to hold the auction that was scheduled

for 27.02.2024.

The petitioners submission

12. When this matter was taken up for argument, Mr. Sanjeewa

Dassanayake, argued that the respondents are not entitled to proceed

with the resolution dated 28.01.2019 in view of the terms of

settlement entered on 16.06.2022, in the Commercial High Court. The

basis of this submission is that the terms of settlement with the

payment plan amounts to a restructuring of the facility. Further, a sum

of Rs. 56 million has been paid as at 30.01.2024 in accordance with

the settlement. However, it is admitted that Rs. 38,600,000 still

remains due and outstanding.

13. Then was also argued that the notice of resolution as failed to comply

with Section 09 of Act No. 04 of 1990, as there has been a failure to

WRT/0125/24

Page 7 of 17

exhibit the notice of auctioned on the land 14 days prior to the date

of auction.

14. It was also submitted that in view of the circulars and directives,

the Central Bank it was illegal and ultra vires, unreasonable and

irrational to have proceeded with the auction in violation and in

frustration of the legitimate expectation of the 1st petitioner.

Respondents submission

15. As opposed to this, it was argued and submitted on behalf of the

respondent bank that the resolution dated 28.01.2019 is valid and

the respondent bank is entitled to proceed with the auction

accordingly. As a preliminary objection, it was submitted that the

petitioner is now challenging the said resolution adopted in January

2019 almost after five years and is guilty of laches. It was also

submitted that the default of petitioner and the resolution was

adopted well before the Covid pandemic as well as the economic

crisis. The said events did not have any relevance to the default and

non-servicing of the said facilities in 2018.

16. The respondent further argued that the petitioners did have an

alternate remedy and in fact did exercise that right by moving the

Commercial High Court in HC Civil /197/2021 MR against the

resolution and also seeking interim relief. The learned Commercial

High Court Judge refused and rejected the interim injunction by

order dated 08.03.2022. Thereafter, the petitioner entered into a

settlement with the respondent bank dated 16.06.2022 in which the

parties agreed to a payment plan (vide P-10). Though, the 1st

petitioner did initially pay Rs. 56 million in accordance with the said

terms of settlement he has since then failed to continue with the

payments as agreed by the said terms of settlement. It is upon this

failure that notice of auction was published.

WRT/0125/24

Page 8 of 17

17. The main argument of the respondent is that the petitioners have

specifically agreed, accepted and conceded the right of the

respondent bank to proceed with the recovery under and by virtue

of the resolution dated 28.01.2019 if there be a default. Having so

held out, the petitioners cannot now take a different position

contrary to what was so agreed or repudiate the former statement.

In summary the main grounds raised are laches, alternate remedy

and estoppel.

Consideration of the arguments

18. It is common ground that a writ of certiorari is sought against the

resolution under Section 4 authorizing the sale of the property is

dated 28.01.2019. This is sought by prayers (c) and (d). Thus, the

petitioners have opted to move this court for a writ after the lapse of

five years. No reason is averred in the petition and neither is any

reason acceptable in law is forthcoming. It is trite law that

prerogative writ is a discretionary remedy and the granting of which

may be refused if there be laches, undue delay or waiver. A petitioner

is not entitled a writ as a matter of course or of right. The Court has

the discretion to deny relief if there be delay, laches, waiver, or

submission to jurisdiction.

19. In Jayaweera v. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services

Ratnapura and Another [1996] 2 SLR 70) the above was held as

follows:

A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the

issue of a Writ of Certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter

of course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine. Even

if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has a discretion to

deny him relief having regard to his conduct, delay, laches,

waiver, submission to jurisdiction - are all valid impediments

which stand against the grant of relief.

WRT/0125/24

Page 9 of 17

20. Then in Bisomenike vs. C. R. de Alwis (1982-1SLR-368),

Sharvananda, J., (as he then was) observed that;

A Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court.

It cannot be held to be a Writ of right or one issued as a

matter of course. The exercise of this discretion by Court is

governed by certain well-accepted principles. The Court is

bound to issue it at the instance of a party aggrieved by the

order of an inferior tribunal except in cases where he has

disentitled himself to the discretionary relief by reason of his

own conduct, submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay

or waiver. The proposition that the Application for Writ must

be sought as soon as the injury is caused is merely an

Application of the equitable doctrine that delay defeats

equity and the longer the injured person sleeps over his

rights without any reasonable excuse the chance of his

success in Writ Application dwindles and the Court may

reject a Writ Application on the ground of unexplained delay.

An Application for a Writ of Certiorari should be filled within

a reasonable time.

21. In Sarath Hulangamuwa vs. Siriwardene, Principal Vishaka

Vidyalaya, Colombo and five others [1981 (1 Sri LR 275)], the

Court of Appeal held that;

The Writs are extraordinary remedies granted to obtain

speedy relief under exceptional circumstances and time is of

the essence of the Application. The laches of the Petitioner

must necessarily be a determining factor in deciding the

Application for Writ as the Court will not lend itself to making

a stultifying order that cannot be carried out.

22. The apparent basis on which the said resolution is challenged is that

the said resolution ceases to be operative in view of the intervening

settlement and making a certain payment. The petitioners attempt to

WRT/0125/24

Page 10 of 17

proceed on the premise that it was a restructure of the facility and the

default after the settlement in the Commercial High Court constitutes

a default of a new facility which thus requires a fresh resolution to be

adopted.

23. Rescheduling primarily adjusts the repayment timeline, whereas

restructuring changes the entire loan structure. Rescheduling is no

more than the modification of loan repayment terms but the principal

terms and conditions of loan contract remain significantly unchanged.

Rescheduling normally will be to extend or lengthen the loan tenure

and may be to revise the payment instalments. In contrast,

restructuring will involve the modification of the principal terms and

conditions of the loan, which may be a change in the structure of the

loan or other significant change to its terms and may involve

restructuring or conversion of the type or nature of the facility, i.e.,

overdraft to term loan.

24. It is common ground that the petitioners did institute action in the

Commercial High Court challenging the resolution. Upon failing to

obtain interim relief, the petitioners entered into the settlement P-10.

By the said terms of settlement, the petitioners and the 1st respondent

agree to reschedule the mode of payment of the amounts in default,

due and payable. The settlement P-10 is no more than rescheduling

and is certainly not restructuring. Thus, to my mind, it is lawful for

the respondent bank to proceed with the said resolution dated

28.01.2019.

25. Then by paragraph 10 of the terms of settlement P-10 the petitioners

hold out that the Respondent bank is entitled to proceed with the

resolution dated 28.01.2019, to recover in the event of any default

(para 10). This term of settlement clearly is an acceptance of the

continuous validity of the original resolution and the petitioners agree

and then concede the respondent banks right to proceed with the said

WRT/0125/24

Page 11 of 17

resolution. The petitioners having so held out and conducted have

induced the respondent bank to agree to the rescheduling of the

amounts due.

26. Having so agreed the petitioners are now estopped, and cannot take a

different position. Estoppel, according to the Black's Law

Dictionary, is that a party is prevented by his own acts from claiming

a right to the detriment of other party who was entitled to rely on such

conduct and has acted accordingly. Section 115 of the Evidence

Ordinance incorporates this concept of estoppel which reads thus;

115. When one person has by his declaration, act, or omission

intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing

to be true and to act upon such belief, neither he nor his

representative shall be allowed in any suit or proceeding between

himself and such person or his representative to deny the truth of

that thing.

27. Section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act is in all fours with Section 115

of our Evidence Ordinance. Sarkar on the Law of Evidence, 12th

Edition, considering this provision, expounded the rationale and the

application as follows;

The principle of estoppel is based on the maxim allegans

contractor non-est audiendus i.e., a party is not to be heard to

allege the contrary. The rule is enacted in Section 115 of the Indian

Evidence Act. A person cannot approbate and reprobate (Durga

Dass v. Sansar Singh, 2003 (1) PLJR 666 (P&H)). The rule of

estoppel is based on equity and good conscience, viz. that it would

be most inequitable and unjust to a person that if another by a

representation made, or by conduct amounting to representation,

has induced him to act as he would not otherwise have done, the

person who made the representation should be allowed to deny or

repudiate the effect of his former statement, to the loss and injury

of the person who acted on it (Prabhu v. Official Liquidator, AIR

WRT/0125/24

Page 12 of 17

2008 KLT 894 (907): AIR 2008 (NOC) 2173 (Ker-DB)). As a doctrine

based on equity, the principle of estoppel in only applicable in

cases where the other party has changed his position relying upon

the representation thereby made (H.R. Basavaraj v. Canara

Bank, (2010) 12 SCC 458).

28. The petitioners are now seeking to resist the said recovery by

challenging the said resolution. The petitioners in the first instance

defaulted well before the pandemic and economic crisis. Having made

a solemn agreement on the resolution, the petitioner cannot now be

heard to take a contrary position. It is unfortunate that this appears

to be a clear abuse of the process of Court at all levels to prevent the

respondent bank from the recovering what is due. As repeatedly

observed by this Court, commercial banks, by and large, hold and are

entrusted with the funds of the public by way of deposits. Therefore,

money lent unless recovered will seriously affect the liquidity and the

stability of the banking institutions. This was the rationale of

implementing the provisions of Act No. 04 of 1990 pertaining to parate

execution conferring the power to sell the collateral in a commercial

transaction to one of the parties giving the power of adjudicating to

that extent. This was deemed as necessary by the legislature to ensure

the unhindered continuity of such banking institutions. It is only

upon expeditious and successful recovery of monies lent and the

banks will have the liquidity and to re-lend and to keep the economy

moving.

29. Notwithstanding the incorporation of these extraordinary statutory

provisions the expeditious recovery in many a case is unduly delayed

by defaulters who are able to use the judicial system to their benefit

which, as I see, is more of an abuse of the process. The submission

that the petitioners have abused the process and successfully delayed

the auction of the property certainly appears to have merit.

WRT/0125/24

Page 13 of 17

30. The next argument advanced is that the notice of auction is not

compliance with the provisions of Section 09 of Act No. 04 of 1990. It

was submitted that a copy of such notice of sale published in the

Gazette had not been posted on or near the property which is to be

sold 14 days prior to the auction. This issue is now academic; the said

auction could not be held due to the interim relief. Therefore,

considering the legal issues, the notice of auction is now superfluous.

However, in context, it may be prudent to make the following

observations.

Section 9 provides for the notice of auction which is as follows;

9. Notice of the date, time and place of every sale authorized by a

resolution under Section 4 shall, not less than fourteen days before

the date fixed for the sale be published in the Gazette and copies

of such notice shall be -

(a) dispatched to the borrower, if he is alive, and to every, person

to whom notice of any resolution is required to be dispatched under

Section 2,

(b) posted on or near the property which is to be sold.

31. Section 09 has three components. It clearly provides that the

publication in the Gazette should be made not less than 14 days from

the date of sale. Then, 2nd and 3rd components are that copies of such

notices should be dispatched to the borrower and also posted on the

property. Therefore, it appears that a mandatory requirement of

14vdays qualifies the publication in the Gazette. It is the copies of

such notice that should be dispatched and posted as required by sub

paragraphs (a) and (b). If one proceeds on the premise with all three

requirements be complied with 14 days notice yet for all the strict

non-compliance with the said minimum 14 days as to the posting on

the property would not and cannot create any prejudice to the

petitioners. With the publication in the Gazette, it is deemed that the

general public is given notice. This requires to be dispatched to the

WRT/0125/24

Page 14 of 17

borrower, primarily to provide the defaulted of an opportunity to

rectify and make payments, and to avoid the same of the property.

Section 10 provides for payment before sell. As the petitioners have

received notice under Paragraph 9(a), they were sufficiently afforded

with the opportunity to pay and settle and prevent the sale of the

property. As for Section 9(b) the objects appeared to give notice to any

other occupier or interested party of the sale. The failure to post on

the property can in no way cause any prejudice to the petitioners who

had due notice. It is trite law where there is no prejudice there would

be no relief by way of writ. It is also noteworthy that, the alleged non-

compliance with Section 9(b) in the forms of not giving the total 14

days notice in the context of this application is no more than a mere

technical non-compliance. Thus, as far as the petitioners are

concerned, the failure to put up a notice on the land 14 days in

advance has not caused any prejudice of whatever form to them. It is

not that there was no notice put up on the land but that it was less

than 14 days. This is if at all, only a minor irregularity that has

certainly caused no prejudice to the petitioners.

32. J. A. N. De Silva, J. (P/CA) (as he then was) in Seneviratne and.

Others v. Urban Council, Kegalle and Others [(2001) 3 Sri.L.R. 105]

rejecting an application for a writ held that;

"If the Appellant has not been prejudiced by the matters on which

he relies on the Court may refuse relief even though he has

succeeded in establishing some defect. The literal or technical

breach of an apparently mandatory provision in a statute may be

so insignificant as not in effect to matter. In those circumstances

the Court may in its discretion refuse relief."

33. Correspondingly Justice Tilakawardane in Amaradasa Liyanage vs.

Sampath Bank PLC (S.C. Appeal No. 126/2012, S.C Minutes

04.04.2014) at p. 12: complementing the afore said dicta opined that;

WRT/0125/24

Page 15 of 17

The ambit and purpose of the Recovery of Loans by Banks Act is,

in essence, to recover monies due to the Bank while ensuring that

the Bank does not enjoy an unjust enrichment. The provisions of

the Act, by allowing parate execution, is to facilitate the process of

collecting monies due, without lengthy court proceedings, and to do

so in a fair and reasonable manner. This objective should therefore

not be hindered by minor procedural irregularities for such minor

irregularities cannot have much impact on the rights of the

borrower. Minor procedural irregularities cannot, further, be

grounds upon which actions may be instituted for such actions

would only amount to the abuse of the process of Court which must

not be allowed.

34. The primary object and purpose of the Recovery of Loans by Banks

Act, in allowing parate execution is to facilitate the expeditious

recovery and collection of monies due, devoid of lengthy court

proceedings. Courts are required to ensure that this objective is not

hindered or stultified by minor procedural irregularities that cannot

have an impact on the rights of, or cause prejudice to, the borrower.

Even if literal or technical breach of an apparently mandatory

provision in a statute is established which causes no prejudice and is

insignificant the Court may in its discretion refuse relief in the

exercise of its writ jurisdiction. Thus, I see no merit in this argument.

35. Getting back to the matter in hand, it is common ground that the

petitioners expressly admit the terms agreed and the settlement

entered into at the Commercial High Court (vide paragraph 13 of the

petition). A copy of the entire proceedings of HC-Civil/197/2021 MR

is annexed marked as P-09 and the terms of settlement is annexed

marked as P-10. According to the journal entry dated 16.06.2022 of

P-09, the terms of settlement P-10 had been entered. Accordingly, the

proceedings have been terminated in view of the settlement so agreed

and entered.

WRT/0125/24

Page 16 of 17

36. The respondent bank and the petitioners have, by virtue of the said

settlement, agreed on a payment plan which in fact which has in effect

rescheduled the payments due in respect of the facility. For all

purposes, the parties in entering the said settlement have agreed that

the respondent bank is entitled to act on the resolution adopted on

28.01.2019 and recover if there be a default. In view of this

representation and so holding out by the petitioners the respondent

bank has been induced to agree to the rescheduling the payments as

opposed to proceeding with the sale. This is not restructuring but

rescheduling as said above. Thus, there is no legal impediment to act

on the resolution adopted on 28.01.2019.

37. When the 1st petitioner failed to make payment as agreed by the said

terms of settlement, it becomes on the one hand a serious violation of

the said agreement, P-10. Then the petitioners have expressly agreed

that any violation in the form of a default of two instalments will entitle

the respondent bank to auction the property under the said resolution

already adopted. Resolutions adopted in accordance with the

provisions of Act No. 04 of 1990 will remain good and valid

notwithstanding the lapse of time. The law does not stipulate a period

within which parate execution or the auction should take place. If any

payment is made between the adopting of the resolution and the

auctioning of the property such sums paid would be given credit to

and set off. The resolution specifically provides that it will recover the

said sum as resolved less payments (if any) since received. That

being so upon the default the respondent bank ipso facto accrued the

right to proceed under the resolution. At that point, the respondent

bank has by virtue of the agreement proceeded to give notice and

schedule the auction based on the said resolution. The petitioners

having so expressly agreed and so held out are now estopped from

challenging the validity or the legal right and entitlement of the

respondent bank to proceed with the said resolution.

WRT/0125/24

Page 17 of 17

38. The petitioner by challenging the right of the bank to proceed with the

said resolution is clearly acting in violation of the terms of settlement

and agreement entered into in the Commercial High Court. To my

mind, this conduct goes against all accepted norms of legal conduct

and it has to be a serious abuse of process. In one breath you enter

into a settlement upon a certain solemn covenant and undertake

before a Court of law and upon violating and reaching such terms is

now making an attempt to obtain an order from a different forum

preventing the other party from act enforcing and exercising the rights

that accrued from such agreement. In this circumstance, the

petitioner has failed to come to this Court with clean hands, I would

say.

39. In the above premises, this application of the petitioner cannot

succeed and should be dismissed due to undue delay (laches), having

an alternate remedy, and in view of the apparent abuse of process.

This petition is accordingly dismissed.

40. The petitioner has named the respondent bank as the 1st respondent

and has also named as 2nd - 10th respondents the chairman and

directors as parties. The naming of entire board of directors as done

in this application appears to be out of the ordinary. There is no

substantive or specific relief prayed against the said 2nd - 10th

respondents separately, and independent to that of the 1st respondent

bank. In these circumstances, the petition is dismissed subject to cost

fixed at Rs. 50,000.00 to be paid to 1st 10th respondents separately.

The application is dismissed subject to the cost.
