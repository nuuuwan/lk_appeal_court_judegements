RESPONDENTS

S. U. B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner to this Writ Application was a Senior Lecturer in the faculty of

Engineering at the University of Ruhuna, the 1st Respondent. The Petitioner proceeded

on a four-month (17.04.2023 to 16.08.2023) sabbatical leave with pay, upon obtaining

the prior approval of the Council of the 1st Respondent (P2). While on sabbatical leave,

the Petitioner submitted his resignation letter dated 15.05.2023 marked as P4 in

compliance with the three-month notice requirement in terms of Paragraph 4:1 of The

Establishments Code of The University Grants Commission and The Higher

Educational Institutions / Institutes of 1984 (the Code) to resign with effect from

15.08.2023. Thereafter, by letter dated 14.06.2023 marked as P6, the Vice Chancellor

of the 1st Respondent (the 2nd Respondent) informed the Petitioner that the Council of

the 1st Respondent at its 436th meeting had decided that the Petitioner must either repay

three months salary or consent to the deduction of three months salary from his

University Provident Fund to accept his resignation. In reply, the Petitioner has

consented to the deduction of three months salary from his University Provident Fund

at the end of the sabbatical leave (P7).

However, as the Petitioners salary for the months of June, July, and August 2023 had

not been paid, he made inquiries regarding the outstanding salary from the Assistant

Bursar. On the same day, the 2nd Respondent, by email dated 11.08.2023 marked as

P11, informed the Petitioner that there exists an obligation to serve a mandatory period

following the completion of sabbatical leave, and if the Petitioner fails to report to work

7

at the end of the sabbatical leave period, a letter of vacation of post could be issued on

the Petitioner. Thereafter, the Petitioner made several inquiries regarding the status of

his resignation letter. By letter dated 27.11.2023 marked as P15, the 2nd Respondent

informed the Petitioner that the Council of the 1st Respondent, at its 440th meeting, had

decided to issue a vacation of post letter against the Petitioner with effect from

15.05.2023, on the basis that the Petitioner was not eligible to tender his resignation

while on sabbatical leave and was required, under the applicable rules and regulations,

to assume duties in the department prior to submitting his resignation. Thereafter, the

Petitioner made a request under the Right to Information Act, No. 12 of 2016, seeking

information regarding the Council decision referred to in the letter marked as P15.

Pursuant to the said request, the Petitioner received a copy of the decision taken by the

Council of the 1st Respondent at its 440th meeting held on 12.10.2023, marked as P22.

In the decision marked as P22 it has stated that the Council of the 1st Respondent has

recommended to inform all staff members on sabbatical leave who decide to resign, to

resume duties immediately and then submit their resignation letters and if failed to

resume duties, vacation of post notices will be issued effective from the date of

submission of the resignation letter. In terms of P22, the Council has approved a two-

year mandatory period of service after the sabbatical leave period is completed. Being

aggrieved by the decision of the Council, the Petitioner appealed against the Council

decision marked as P22 to the University Service Appeal Board. The Petitioner states

that he tendered his resignation in accordance with the procedure set out under the

8

Code. Accordingly, argues that the Council decision marked as P22, which was

communicated to him by the letter marked as P15, is erroneous in law.

Being aggrieved by the said decision of the Council of the 1st Respondent, the Petitioner

has filed the instant Application, seeking the following substantive reliefs, inter alia,

c) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari to quash the

decision of the 2nd to 25th Respondents marked P22 and its communication

marked P15, respectively dated 12/10/2023 and 27/11/2023, which denied the

acceptance of the resignation of the Petitioner marked P4.

d) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 2nd

to 25th Respondents of the Council to accept the resignation letter submitted by

the Petitioner Marked P4.

e) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st

Respondent to pay to the Petitioner his salary for the months of June, July, and

August 2023.

The contention of the Petitioner is that he followed the procedure laid down in

Paragraph 4 of Chapter V of the Code by giving three months' prior notice before

resignation, and there is no provision in the Code prohibiting a member of the staff

from tendering resignation within two years after the completion of sabbatical leave.

Therefore, the decision of the Council marked as P22 communicated to the Petitioner

by the letter marked as P15 is erroneous in law and is ultra vires. The basis for this

9

argument is that it is prohibited to submit resignations while on study leave under

Paragraph 4:11 of Chapter V of the Code, as it amounts to a violation of the bond

between such a person and the Higher Educational institute, but there is no such

prohibition for a member of the staff who applies for sabbatical leave. The Petitioner

further argues that the Council, in its decision marked as P22, relies on Paragraph 36:9

of Chapter X of the Code in refusing to accept his resignation. However, it only imposes

a duty on the governing authority to be satisfied when granting sabbatical leave that the

member of the staff intends to continue service after completing such leave and does

not create a binding obligation on the staff member to complete a mandatory service

period. Paragraph 36:9 reads thus,

Sabbatical leave shall not be granted unless the Governing Authority is satisfied

that the member of staff concerned will serve the Higher Educational

Institution/Commission to which he belongs for a period of at least two years on

his resumption of duties after such leave.

The Petitioner further contends that Paragraph 36:9 of the Code should not be

interpreted in isolation but must be read in conjunction with the other relevant

provisions, particularly Paragraph 36:13 of Chapter X, which expressly provides that a

member of the academic staff who avails themselves of sabbatical leave is not required

to enter into any agreement or bond in respect of such leave. Accordingly, the Petitioner

submits that no post-leave service obligation arises by operation of law. In support of

10

this position, the Petitioner relies on Paragraph 33(a) of Chapter X of the Code, which

mandates the execution of an agreement to serve the Higher Educational Institution

upon resumption of duties following the grant of study leave, thereby demonstrating a

clear distinction in the obligations imposed in respect of sabbatical leave and study

leave.

The position of the Respondents regarding this is that, in terms of Paragraph 36:9 of

Chapter X of the Code, an obligatory requirement exists to serve a minimum period of

two years upon the conclusion of sabbatical leave, and that this has been the established

practice of the 1st Respondent. Furthermore, relying on Paragraph 22 of Chapter X of

the Code, the Respondents assert that an employee is not entitled to leave once a notice

of resignation has been tendered. Paragraph 22 reads thus,

A person who has tendered his resignation from his appointment will not be

entitled to any annual leave or casual leave immediately prior to termination of

his appointment.

Further, the Respondents argue that notifying the Petitioner of the notice of vacation of

post by the letter marked as P15, which has conveyed the Council decision marked as

P22, was done in terms of paragraphs 4:1 and 4:1:1 of Chapter V, Paragraph 36:9 of

Chapter X and Paragraph 7:1 of Chapter V of the Code.

The question before this Court is whether the Council decision marked as P22

communicated to the Petitioner by the letter marked as P15 is erroneous in law as

11

claimed by the Petitioner. The procedure governing the submission of resignations is

set out in Chapter V of the Code. In terms of Paragraph 4:1 of Chapter V, a teacher

employed in a Higher Educational Institution may resign from service by giving three

months prior written notice. However, where such prior notice cannot be given,

Paragraph 4:1:1 of Chapter V stipulates that the teacher is required to pay three months

salary to the Institution in lieu of a notice. Paragraph 4:1 and 4:1:1 are as follows,

4:1 A teacher employed in a Higher Educational Institution may resign his

appointment upon giving three months' notice in writing to the Governing

Authority of the Institution. Such notice should be sent through the Head of

the Department, the Dean of the Faculty and the Principal Executive Officer

of the Institution. Teachers employed in Institutes should give notice through

the Principal Executive Officer of the Institute to be forwarded to the Vice-

Chancellor of the University to which it is attached, for consideration by the

Governing Authority.

4:1:1 Where it is not possible to give the required three months' notice, the teacher

shall pay the Institution three months' salary in lieu of such notice.

The Petitioner has submitted his resignation letter marked as P4 on 15.05.2023, giving

three months prior notice. Therefore, it is evident from P4 that he has followed the

correct procedure for resignation under the Code by giving three months prior notice.

Now the question arises whether it is permitted to submit a resignation while on

12

sabbatical leave in terms of the Code. The argument of the learned Senior State Counsel

appearing for the Respondents is that, in terms of Paragraph 36:9 of Chapter X of the

Code, a teacher who went on sabbatical leave must serve a two-year obligatory service

period following the completion of a sabbatical leave period. The Petitioners

contention is that there is no such obligation on his part, as Paragraph 36:13 of Chapter

X specifically states that there is no requirement to enter into a bond or agreement on

such leave, and the obligation lies on the Respondents to be satisfied themselves that

the applicant will resume duties after obtaining sabbatical leave. Nowhere in the Code

expressly prohibits the submission of a resignation while on sabbatical leave. Paragraph

36:9 merely stipulates that the governing authority must be satisfied that the member

of the staff intends to resume duties and continue in service for a period of two years

upon the completion of the sabbatical leave. The Respondents have neither submitted

any document nor has satisfied this Court as to which material facts the governing

authority of the 1st Respondent has satisfied itself that the Petitioner will resume duties

after the completion of his sabbatical leave. In the letter marked as P15, it is stated that,

in terms of the applicable rules and regulations, the Petitioner is not eligible to tender

his resignation while on sabbatical leave. The learned Senior State Counsel appearing

for the Respondents attempts to establish this position by arguing that no teacher is

entitled to leave after submitting his resignation under Paragraph 22 of Chapter X of

the Code. However, the said Paragraph is applicable only in relation to annual and

casual leave and has no application to sabbatical leave. The 1984 Code is the Code

13

which is applicable to the present Application. This Court further observes that by the

Code published in 2023, Paragraph 36:9 of the 1984 Code has been repealed, evidently

to address certain lacunae therein. Considering the above-stated facts, it is the view of

this Court that there is no provision in the Code that prevents the Petitioner from

submitting his resignation while on sabbatical leave. Upon careful consideration of the

arguments advanced by both parties and the relevant provisions of the Code, this Court

is inclined to agree with the contention of the Petitioner. Therefore, the Respondents

have acted ultra vires their powers as there is no provision in the Code expressly

prohibiting submission of resignation while on sabbatical leave.

In Administrative Law, by H. W. R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth (11th edn, at page 28), it

states thus,

Any administrative act or order which is ultra vires or outside jurisdiction is

void in law, i.e. deprived of legal effect. If it is not within the powers given by the

Act, it has no legal leg to stand on.

In Attorney-General v. The Great Eastern Railway Co.,1 it was held by Lord Selborne

that,

[T]he doctrine of ultr vires ought to be reasonably, and not unreasonably,

understood and applied, and that whatever may fairly be regarded as incidental

1 (1880) 5 A.C. 473

14

to, or consequential upon, those things which the Legislature has authorized, ought

not (unless expressly prohibited) to be held, by judicial construction, to be ultr

vires.

In the case of Liyanage and others v. Gampaha Urban Council and others, 2where the

Petitioners in that application sought a writ of certiorari and prohibition against a

decision of the Gampaha Urban Council to establish a weekly fair on Market Street

claiming that neither the Urban Councils Ordinance nor any other statute empowered

the Urban Council to organize a fair or market on a thoroughfare, this Court held that,

Anything purported to be done, by the Council, in excess of what is permitted by

the statutory provisions will be considered as wholly invalid in law, on the

application of the doctrine of ultra vires. However, in construing the relevant

statutory provisions the Court will bear in mind the need to promote the general

legislative purpose underlying these provisions and consider whether the

impugned act is incidental to or consequential upon the express provisions. If it

is so considered necessary, the impugned act will not be declared ultra vires.

The Code does not expressly prohibit the submission of a resignation while on

sabbatical leave, nor can Paragraph 36:9 be construed as incidental or consequential to

such a prohibition, as there are no other provisions in the Code that imply a prohibition

against resigning during sabbatical leave or an obligation to resume duties upon its

2 (1991) 1 SLR 1

15

completion. Accordingly, this Court is of the view that the Respondents have acted ultra

vires in determining that the Petitioner is obligated to resume duties upon completion

of sabbatical leave and that the submission of a resignation during such leave is not

permitted.

Furthermore, the Respondents rely on Paragraph 7:1 of Chapter V of the Code in

justifying the Council decision in P22 and the Letter marked as P15, where the

Petitioner has been served with a notice of vacation of post. Paragraph 7:1 reads thus,

A person employed in the Commission/ Higher Educational Institution/ Institute

who absents himself from duty without prior approval will be deemed to have

vacated his post from the date of such absence and he should be immediately

informed in writing by registered post or by any appropriate means by the

disciplinary authority.

In terms of Paragraph 7:1, if a person absents himself from duty without prior approval,

it is considered that he has vacated his post. However, considering the fact that the

Petitioner has adhered to the proper procedure in submitting his resignation and the fact

that Respondents have erred in deciding that the Petitioner is not entitled to submit

resignation while on sabbatical leave, this Court is of the view that Respondents are not

entitled to issue notice of vacation of post on the Petitioner.

Furthermore, it should also be emphasised that since the Petitioner has given three

months prior notice in his resignation letter marked as P4 in compliance with

16

Paragraph 4:1 of Chapter V of the Code, this Court see no reason why the Respondents

should withhold the Petitioners salary for the months of June, July and August 2023.

Therefore, it is the view of this Court that the Respondents have acted ultra vires in not

paying the Petitioner his salary for the months of June, July and August 2023.

Considering all the above-stated facts and circumstances, this Court is of the view that

the decision of the Council marked as P22 communicated to the Petitioner by letter

marked as P15 is ultra vires. Accordingly, this Court grants relief prayed for in prayers

(c), (d) and (e) of the Petition. Application allowed. No costs ordered.

Application allowed
