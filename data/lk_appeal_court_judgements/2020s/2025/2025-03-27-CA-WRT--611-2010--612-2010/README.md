Judgment

M.C.B.S. Morais J.

This is an application for mandates in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari and a Writ of

Prohibition in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic

of Sri Lanka.

The Toyota Lanka (Private) Limited (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Petitioner)

seeks a writ of Certiorari to quash the purported decision made by the Department of

Customs (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Respondent) in terms of section 18(2) of

the Customs Ordinance. It was agreed between the parties that one judgment would be

delivered regarding the writ application bearing No. 612/2010 and the writ application

bearing No. 611/2010 since the issue of law is identical to both applications. The Petitioner

has sought a writ of certiorari to quash the decision made by the 1st Respondent on 1st of

September 2010, in terms of section 18(2) of the Customs Ordinance. Accordingly, the

Petitioner has prayed for the followings,

I. Issue notice on the Respondents;

II. Call for the record;

Page 3 of 7

III. Issue a writ of certiorari quashing the aforesaid decision dated 1/9/2010 of the 1st

Respondent produced marked P16 to recover the purported short payment of

Rs.67,380,782/- in terms of Section 18(2) of the Customs Ordinance;

IV. Issue a writ of prohibition restraining the Respondents from taking any steps in

pursuance of the aforesaid decision dated 1/9/2010 contained in the letter

produced marked P16 to recover the purported short payment of Rs.67,380,782/-;

V. To make an interim order restraining the Respondents from taking any steps in

pursuance of the aforesaid decision dated 1/9/2010 contained in the letter

produced marked P16 to recover the purported short payment of Rs.67,380,782/-

until the final hearing and determination of this Application;

VI. To grant costs; and

VII. To grant such other and further relief as to Your Lordships' Court shall

seem fit and meet.

The Petitioner Company is a fully owned subsidiary of Toyota Tsusho Corporation,

incorporated under the Companies Act of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the Petitioner who is an

importer of Toyota Motor Vehicles into Sri Lanka, imported 31 units of Toyota Land Cruiser

Prado Model LJ I-20R-GKMEE Vehicles in 13 batches in the years 2003, 2004 and 2005

which is classified under the HS Code 8702.10.01. At the time of importation, the Petitioner

has submitted the Bill of Entry in terms of the Customs Ordinance. The Petitioner contends

that before the vehicles were released, they were physically examined by a Customs officer

who was empowered to do so.

However, on the 6th of December 2005, the Department of Customs issued a seizure notice

under section 125 of the Customs Ordinance. The Respondent contends that the H.S Code

8702.10.01 does not apply to the said vehicles as every vehicle had only 9 seats instead of

10. Accordingly, it is contended that the said imported vehicles should be classified under HS

Code 8703.32.07.

The Petitioner contends that the motive of the said seizure was to earn rewards in terms of

section 153 of the Customs Ordinance. Therefore, the Petitioner has filed a writ application

No.2118/2005 seeking to quash the seizure. However, the application was initially dismissed

by the Court of Appeal as it was premature. Being aggrieved by the order, the Petitioner has

made an appeal to the Supreme Court Case No.49/2008, and the Supreme Court has delivered

Page 4 of 7

judgment quashing the seizure notice in the judgment dated 20th of March 2009.(Toyota

Lanka(Pvt) Ltd and another V Jayathilaka and others (2009) 1 SLR 276). However, at the

end of the judgment of the Supreme Court, the Court refers as;

This order will not prejudice the authority of an officer of customs or recover any

sums that are due according to law.

On the said basis, the Respondent purporting to act in terms of section 18(2) of the Customs

Ordinance, sent a letter of demand dated 1st of September 2010, demanding the Petitioner the

payment of Rs.67,380,782/= as Customs duty and other levies based on misclassification.

The Respondent contends that the Toyota Prados that were classified under the HS Code

8702.10.01 should be classified under HS Code 8703.32.07 and alleges that there was a

short payment of Rs.67,380,782/= as Customs duty and other levies.

The section 18(2) of the Customs Ordinance refers as follows,

(2) When any duties, dues or charges on any goods, imported or exported, have been

short levied or where any such duties, dues or charges after having been levied, have

been erroneously refunded, the persons chargeable with the duties, dues or charges

so short levied or to whom such refund has erroneously been made shall pay the

deficiency or repay the amount so erroneously refunded, if the payment of the amount

short levied or erroneously refunded shall be demanded within twenty- four months

from the date of such short levy or refund.

The above reproduced section 18(2) of the Customs Ordinance requires the payment of short

levy shall be demanded within twenty-four months from the date of the levy. However, the

Petitioner has received the letter of demand for the short levy after the expiration of twenty-

four months. Factually, the relevant vehicles were initially levied in 2003 to 2005 and the

subsequent demand on short levies was made in 2010. Therefore, the Petitioner has sought a

writ application No.612/2010 seeking a writ of certiorari to quash the letter of demand dated

1st of September 2010, as it is contrary to section 18(2) of the Customs Ordinance. However,

the Respondent has objected to the application on the ground that the period of 24 months

referred to in section 18(2) of the Customs Ordinance should commence from the date of the

judgment of the Supreme Court in S.C. Appeal 49/2008 delivered on 20th of March 2009.

Accordingly, this Court in the order dated 19th of October 2010 has sustained the argument of

Page 5 of 7

the Respondent and decided the letter of demand was within two years. Consequently, the

Petitioner has sought leave to Appeal from the Supreme Court against the said order of the

Court of Appeal dated 19th of October 2010. The Supreme Court in SC Appeal 179/2010, by

its order dated 2nd of July 2012 has held that it cannot be construed that the period of 24

months begins from the date of the judgment of the Supreme Court.

In the case of SC Appeal No.179/2010, Gamini Amaratuga J. has held,

In dealing with this appeal I wish to make the following observations. The words in

section 18(2) are plain, clear and unambiguous. The point of time from which the

period of 24 months has to be reckoned is clearly laid down by the words "from the

date of such short levy or refund in section 18(2). The Court of Appeal has held that

the 24-month period begins to run from the due of the judgment of the Supreme Court

i.e.20.03.2009. What the Supreme Court has said was that "This order will not

prejudice the authority of an officer of customs to recover any sums that are due

according to law". This sentence cannot be construed to mean that the period of 24

months begins to run from the date of the judgment of the Supreme Court.

Further, the following observations by His Lordship Gamini Amaratunga J are of utmost

relevance.

on the other hand, the last sentence of the judgment of the Supreme Court (quoted

above) can reasonably be construed in two different ways to mean two different

things. One can contend that it means that any sums due may be recovered

according to law. If this view is taken, it at once brings into focus section 18(2) of

the Customs Ordinance. On the other hand, if the sentence is construed to mean that

any sums that are due according to law may be recovered it brings in to focus the

necessity of deciding the date of such a short levy. In this context, it is pertinent to

note that the appellant company and the customs authorities had different views with

regard to the appropriate classification of the H.S Code applicable to the motor

vehicles in question. The Companys position was that classification 8702-10-01 was

appropriate one, the customs authorities contended that it was classification 8703-32-

07. The supreme Court has not decided the appropriate classification applicable to

the motor vehicles in question. Without deciding the appropriate classification into

which the vehicle in question falls, it is not possible, for the purposes of section 18(2)

Page 6 of 7

of the Customs Ordinance, to determine whether there had in fact been a short levy.

The Court of Appeal has not given its mind to this aspect of the matter before deciding

to refuse o issue notice on the respondents in the first instance although the customs

authorities had issues the letter of demand sought be quashed on the assumption that

H.S.C ode 8703.32.07 applied to the vehicles and that there had been a short levy of

duty.

Therefore, it has become necessary for us to determine if the Supreme Court by its initial

decision has intended to grant an exception to the time limit prescribed under section 18(2) of

the Customs Ordinance. The sentence "This order will not prejudice the authority of an

officer of customs to recover any sums that are due according to law" could best be

interpreted as if there is any due as for the law at that time, this judgment should not prevent

of such being charged. However, as apparent from the clear wording of section 18(2) of the

Customs Ordinance, such a short levy could not be imposed after 24 months. Therefore, in

my view by the time the Supreme Court Judgement was pronounced on the 20th of March

2009, there was nothing legally due as more than 24 months had lapsed since the alleged

short levies.

Accordingly, the timeline prescribed under section 18(2) cannot be considered to start from

the date of the judgment of the Supreme Court on 20.03.2009. Therefore, it is clear that the

officers of the customs have not resorted to the initial steps prescribed by law in due course.

Now the issue of proper classification shall be addressed. Initially, the Petitioners has

classified these vehicles under H.S. Code 8703.32.07, which the officers of the Respondents

having inspected have approved. Subsequently, in 2005 the Respondents having suddenly

found that the said classification was incorrect, decided to resort to section 47 of the Customs

Ordinance which is held to be an inappropriate procedure. Therefore, it seems to be an

internal issue of the Respondents as to the proper classification of the said vehicles, which

has to be addressed after a proper inquiry. However, at this stage, this issue will not arise as

whatever the classification it is, it would merely be of an academic interest and will not

influence the outcome of this case as I have observed above, the issue of charging short levy

is already prescribed.

Considering the materials discussed above, it is apparent that the decision to short levy the

Petitioner, taken by the Respondent is contrary to section 18(2) of the Customs Ordinance,

hence ultra vires.

Therefore, this application is allowed and the reliefs prayed by the prayer III and IV are

granted.

No Cost ordered.
