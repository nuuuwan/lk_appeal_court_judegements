JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named 1st Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted along with 2nd Accused by the Attorney General on

following charge:

On or about the 08th February 2010 the accused committed the murder of

Abdul Wahab Saheed which is an offence punishable under Section 296 read

along with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

CA/HCC/0093/20

As the Appellant opted for a non-jury trial, the trial commenced before a

judge and the prosecution had led eight witnesses and marked production

P1-4 and closed the case. Learned High Court Judge having satisfied that

the evidence presented by the prosecution warrants a case to answer, called

for the defence and explained the rights of the accused.

The Appellant made a Dock Statement and called a witness on his behalf.

The learned High Court Judge having considered the evidence led by both

parties convicted the Appellant under Section 297 of Penal Code and

sentence him to 15 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 25000/-.

The fine is subjected to a default sentence of 06-month rigorous

imprisonment. Additionally, a compensation of Rs.100,000/- was ordered to

pay with a default sentence of 2 years rigorous imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid sentence the Appellant preferred this appeal

to this court.

The 2nd Accused was acquitted from the charge.

The Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that

the Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. At the

hearing the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform from prison.

The Learned Presidents Counsel extended his argument on the basis that

the facts and circumstances of this case only warrants a sentence under the

second limb of Section 297 of the Penal Code.

The exception 4 to Section 294 (Murder) of the Penal Code states as

follows:

Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden

quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or

acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

CA/HCC/0093/20

Explanation: - It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the

provocation or commits the first assault.

Section 297 of the Penal Code states as follows:

Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be

punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

extend to twenty years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by which

the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing

such bodily injury as is likely to cause death;

or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

extend to ten years, or with fine, or with both, if the act is done with

the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention

to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause

death.

The background of the case is briefly as follows:

The deceased was working in a fish hut with several others. The Appellant

had come with the 2nd Accused and a problem arose with the deceased about

a line rope. Afterwords, the deceased had left for home on foot, and the

Appellant and the 2nd Accused left the place in an hour later. At about 12 in

the night the deceased was found lying face downward near the Air Force

camp.

Air Force personnel had seen the Appellant carrying a pole and the deceased

lying fallen next to him. The evidence transpired that the Appellant was

drunk at that time.

According to the JMO who held the post mortem examination, had stated

that the death had occurred due injuries to the brain and the spleen. The

doctor had noted 09 external injuries on the deceaseds body.

CA/HCC/0093/20

The doctor who had examined the Appellant on that day at the hospital had

given evidence on behalf of the Appellant and confirmed that the Appellant

was under influence of liquor at that time.

In Don Shamantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha v. The Attorney General

CA/303/2006 and C.A.L.A. 321/2006 decided on 11/07/2012 the Court

held that:

It is trite law that even if the accused does not specifically take up the

defence of a general or special exception to criminal liability, if the facts

and circumstances before the court disclose that there were such

materials to sustain such a plea then the court must consider whether

the accused should be convicted for a lesser offence.

In this case evidence transpired that there is some degree of voluntary

intoxication on the part of the Appellant. Even the State Counsel did not

cross examine the defence witness with regard to the intoxication of the

Appellant.

In Jayathilaka v. The Attorney General [2003] 1 SLR 107 the court held

that:

Though the accused has not taken up the defence of intoxication if such

defence arises on the evidence, it is the duty of the jury to consider the

same.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge had considered the intoxication

when the Appellant was sentenced but failed to consider the sentence under

second limb of the Section 297 of Penal Code.

CA/HCC/0093/20

Hence, considering all the circumstances of this case, I set aside the sentence

imposed on the Appellant and substitute with a term of 10 years rigorous

imprisonment. A fine of Rs.10000/- with 06 months default sentence also

imposed on the Appellant. Payment of compensation with default sentence

will remain the same.

As the Appellant is in prison since the date of conviction by the Learned High

Court Judge, I order the sentence imposed by this Court be operative from

20/10/2020.

Subject to the above variation the appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Trincomalee along with the original case record.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

K.M.G. H. KULATUNGA, J.

I agree.
