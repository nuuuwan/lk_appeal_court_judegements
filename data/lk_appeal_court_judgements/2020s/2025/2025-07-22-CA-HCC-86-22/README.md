JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as "the Accused") was indicted

before the High Court of Colombo for the possession and trafficking of 333.7g grams of

Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) and possession of 660mg of Cannabis Sativa alias Ganja

Page 3 of 9

under Section 54A(d) and 54A(b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance,

as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

The prosecution, to substantiate the charge, examined eleven witnesses. The

Accused gave a dock statement and did not call any witnesses. After the trial, the Learned

High Court Judge found the Accused guilty on all 3 counts, convicted, and sentenced him

to life imprisonment for the 1st and 2nd charges and imposed a jail term of 6 months

rigorous imprisonment for the 3rd charge.

Being aggrieved by said judgment and sentence, this appeal was preferred by the Accused.

The following Grounds of Appeal were urged by the counsel for the Accused.

a. Did the Learned High Court Judge fail to consider the legal requirement set

out in section 74 of the Prison Ordinance/Act where substance arrested by the

prison authority from a prisoner?

b. Did the Learned High Court Judge disregard the fact that the production shall

be handed over to either a police magistrate immediately after the recovery,

according to the Prison Act?

c. Did the Learned High Court Judge falter in applying his judicial mind by

dangerously relying on the witness testimony of PW1?

d. Did the Learned High Court Judge err in law by not attaching sufficient and

necessary weight to the evidence led by the defence namely the dock statement?

e. Did the High Court Judge find the Accused Appellant guilty in the absence of

cogent evidence to prove exclusive possession without considering conscious

possession?

The relevant facts giving rise to the prosecution are that, according to PW01, Dulanjaya

Randika Wijayananda, whose primary duty on 01.03.2019 was to conduct searches of

officers, suspects, and prisoners entering the prison's search room, he carried out a search

of the Accused, who had returned from the Mount Lavinia Court. During this search,

PW01 observed an unusual swelling in the straps of the Accused's slippers. He then

summoned PW02 to cut open the straps, which revealed a concealed package.

Page 4 of 9

Additionally, a second package was discovered in the heel of one of the slippers. The

contents were identified as Kerala Ganja. Subsequently, the production and the accused

were handed over to PW10, and the productions were later taken to the Borella Police

along with the Accused for further action. It was sent to the Government Analyst.

According to the Government Analyst, the said powder contained 6.324 grams of heroin.

Upon the conclusion of the evidence of the prosecution, in the Dock statement, the

accused vehemently denied the said accusation.

According to the accused, on 01.03.2019, he was brought before the Mount Lavinia

Magistrate Court from the prison and placed in the holding cell adjacent to the

magistrates chambers. Due to illness, he had fallen asleep. Upon being called by an

officer, he discovered that his slippers were missing. He then wore a pair of slippers that

were lying near the doorway and proceeded to the defendants cell. After the hearing

concluded, he was escorted out, but the officer did not permit him to retrieve the slippers.

During a search at the main entrance, officers pointed to the slippers and asked, What

are these? The accused stated that the slippers were not his and claimed he did not know

that they contained heroin.

In the present case, the accused was charged and convicted of heroin possession

and trafficking. The central issue is whether the accused had the necessary knowledge of

the parcels concealed within the straps of the slippers he was wearing.

General Possession is defined in Strouds Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases

Eighth Edition Volume 3, Greenberg, page 2223;

"Controlled drug in his possession" (Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (c.38) s.5(2)). A man

who put a small quantity of cannabis into his wallet, knowing what it was, remained in

"possession" of it within the meaning of this section even though he had long forgotten it

was there (R. v Martindale [1986] 1 W.L.R. 1042). A woman who did no more than live

with a man at a time when he possessed and dealt in drugs was not herself guilty of

possession, notwithstanding that she must have known what he was doing (R. v Bland

[1988] Crim. L.R. 41). Where an accused was apprehended while delivering a box

containing cannabis resin to a co-defendant, he was held to be guilty of having a

"controlled drug in his possession", notwithstanding his claim that he thought the box

contained pornographic videos (R. v McNamara (1988) 87 Cr.App.R. 246). In construing

Page 5 of 9

the word "possession" the question to be asked was whether on the facts the defendant

had been proved to have, or ought to have imputed to him, the intention to possess what

was in fact a controlled drug (R. v Lewis (1988) 87 Cr.App.R. 270).

Lord Wilberforce in Warner v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner (1968) 52

Criminal Appeal Report 373. has considered this matter;

The question, to which an answer is required, and in the end, a jury must answer

it, is whether in the circumstances the Accused should be held to have possession of the

substance, rather than mere control. In order to decide between these two, the jury should,

in my opinion, be invited to consider all the circumstances- to use again the words of

Pollock and Wright, possession in the common law, P. 119- the modes or events by which

the custody commences and the legal incident in which it is held. By these I mean, relating

them to typical situations, that they must consider the manner and circumstances in

which the substance, or something which contains it, had been received, what knowledge

or means of knowledge or guilty knowledge as to the presence of the substance, or as to

the nature of what has been received, the Accused had at the time of receipt or thereafter

up to the moment when he is found with it; his legal relation to the substance or package

(including his right of access to it). On such matters as these (not exhaustively stated)

they must make the decision whether, in addition to physical control, he has, or ought to

have imputed to him the intention to possess, or knowledge that he does possess, what is,

in fact, a prohibited substance. If he has this intention or knowledge, it is not additionally

necessary that he should know the nature of the substances.

Lord Widgery CJ in R v. Searle and Others, The Criminal Law Review 1971,592,

Held that;

If you think they were and that they all knew that those drugs were then in the

possession of other people and they knew they were drugs then you probably will not have

any difficulty in deciding that they are guilty, whichever of them you think is guilty, and

is it conceivable, do you think, that drugs were there in (those) quantities without

anybody or everybody in the van knowing about it and that they were dangerous drugs?

That really is the essence of the case.

Held, allowing the appeals, the effect of those parts of the summing -up was to

equate knowledge with possession. However, mere knowledge of the presence of a

Page 6 of 9

forbidden article in the hands of a confederate was not enough: joint possession had to be

established. The sort of direction which ought to have been given was to ask the jury to

consider whether the drugs formed a common pool from which all had the right to draw

at will, and whether there was a joint enterprise to consume drugs together because then

the possession of drugs by one of them in pursuance of that common intention might well

be possession on the part of all of them: Thompson (1869) 21 L.T. 397. The summing-up

was inadequate and possibly misleading. Although there was ample evidence to justify a

conviction it was impossible to say with certainty that all the defendants were guilty and

so it was not a case in which the proviso could be applied.

Recently His Lordship Aluwihare PC J in the case of Mohamed Iqbal Mohamed

Sadath v. Attorney General, SC Appeal 110/15, (SC Minutes 14.12.2020), held:

Lord Wilberforce went on to state that, on such matters as above, though not

exhaustively stated, it must be decided whether in addition to physical control, he has or

ought to have imputed to him, the intention to possess or knowledge that he does possess,

what is in fact a prohibited substance. The above reasoning in my view is a rational

guideline that should be adopted in deciding as to whether the Accused had the knowledge

(the requisite mens rea) that what he possessed is a prohibited substance, even though he

may not have known the precise nature of the substance. Further, he held that: It would

not be unreasonable to presume that it was well within his knowledge that people do

smuggle contraband into the country under various guises, given the social standing of

the Accused.

In light of the aforementioned authorities, it is necessary to assess the following

facts in order to determine whether the accused possessed the requisite knowledge that

the parcel found in his possession contained heroin.

1. The accused was transported from prison to the Magistrate's Court of Mount

Lavinia.

2. According to witnesses 1 and 2, the specific straps of the slippers had been

stitched.

3. According to the accused, when he attempted to inspect the slippers, the prison

officer prevented him from doing so and instead handed him a pair to wear

Page 7 of 9

The only inference that can be drawn from these facts is that the Accused did not

had the requisite knowledge regarding the parcel which contained heroin. The

Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the Accused's Version.

I am mindful of the words uttered by Chief Justice, Mr. Drake, and Justice

Henry, in James MC Namara, 1988 (87) Cr. App. R. 246, Held that;

In the well-known case of Warner v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner (1968) 52

Cr. App. R. 373, [1969] 2 A.C. 256, Lord Wilberforce at p.433 and p. 300

respectively put the matter thus:

the following propositions seem to us to emerge. First of all a man does not have

possession of something which has been put into his pocket or into his house

without his knowledge: in other words something which is planted on him, to use

the current vulgarism. Secondly, a mere mistake as to the quality of a thing under

the defendants control is not enough to prevent him being in possession. For

instance, if a man is in possession of heroin, believing it to be cannabis or

believing it perhaps to be asprin.

Thirdly, if the defendant believe that the things is of a wholly different nature

from that which in fact it is, then the result, to use the words of Lord Pearce, would

be otherwise, Fourthly. in the case of a container or a box, the defendants

possession of the box leads to the strong inference that he is in possession of the

contents or whatsoever it is inside the box. But if the contents are quite different

in kind from he believed, he is not in possession of it.

.... the prima facie assumption is discharged if he proves (or raises a real

doubt in the matter) either (a) that he was a servant or bailee who had no right to

open it and no reason to suspect that its contents were illicit or were drugs or (b)

that although he was the owner he had no knowledge of including a genuine

mistake as to) its actual contents or of their illicit nature and that he received them

innocently and also that he had had no reasonable opportunity since receiving the

package of acquainting himself with its actual contents.

In the present case, the Accused has asserted that the slipper in question did not

belong to him and that he had simply placed two slippers found in front of the door.

He further claims that the officer prevented him from exchanging them.

Page 8 of 9

Additionally, he maintains that he conveyed this account to the police officers. It

is noteworthy that he was taken from Welikada Prison to the Magistrate Court,

and subsequently returned to the prison. Thereafter, he was questioned regarding

how the parcel had been so neatly stitched into the slipper. This raises the

question: was the Accused deliberately involved in an attempt to smuggle the

substance into the prison, or was this orchestrated by someone else?

The accused has created the doubt, but this was not considered by the Learned High

Court Judge.

It is pertinent to refer to the dictum of Justice Sisira De Abrew with regard to how

the evidence given by an accused should be evaluated in Thirunganapillai

Sivakumar v AG SC. Appeal 39/2019 SCM dated 23.01.2020 held that;

For the benefit of the Trial Judges and the legal practitioners of this country, we

would like to state the following guidelines as to how the evidence given by an Accused

person should be evaluated.

1) If the accused's evidence is believed, it must be acted upon.

2) If the evidence of the accused raises a reasonable doubt, in the prosecution's

case, the defence of the accused must succeed.

3) If the evidence of the accused is neither accepted nor rejected by the trial Court,

the defence of the accused must succeed.

In the present case, the learned Trial Judge has failed to follow the above guidelines.

Further, the learned Trial Judge has failed to decide whether he accepts the evidence of

the accused person or rejects it.

So in the instant case, we hold that evidence of the Accused raises a reasonable doubt as

to whether the Accused had the requisite knowledge that the parcel in his possession

contained heroin. Therefore, I hold that the Learned High Court Judge has failed to

address this point.

Considering all the aforementioned matters, we hold that the prosecution has failed to

prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. For the aforementioned reasons, we set aside

Page 9 of 9

the Judgment of the High Court of Colombo dated 23.03.2022 and acquit the Accused-

Appellant from all the charges on which he was convicted.

Accused acquitted.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a certified copy of this Judgment to the

relevant High Court.
