Judgment

1) The Accused-Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as “the Petitioner”)

instituted the instant Revision Application seeking to have the order dated 08.04.2024

CA/HCC/0021/2023

3 | P a g e

and 16.04.2024 of the learned Magistrate of Walasmulla in the case No 84237, and the

order No HCRA 11/2024, dated 27.06.2024 of the learned Judge of the High Court of

Tangalle to set aside or revised.

2) The Petitioner was charged before the Magistrate Court of Walasmulla for possessing

10 grams of Cannabis Sativa, which is an offence punishable under Section 78(5) of

the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

3) When the charge was read out to the Petitioner on 08.04.2024, he tendered an

unconditional plea of guilty to the charge at the very first instance. Accordingly, the

learned Magistrate convicted him and imposed a fine of Rs 8000.00 with a default

sentence of two-month imprisonment.

4) Subsequently, on 16.04.2024, an application was made on behalf of the Petitioner,

seeking to convert the fine to a State cost as the Petitioner is an army corporal

attached to Sri Lanka Army. But the learned Magistrate was not inclined to allow the

application as she had already imposed the fine and the matter was concluded.

5) Thereafter, the Petitioner made an application in revision to the High Court of

Tangalle seeking to have the learned Magistrate’s Order set aside and a State cost

ordered in lieu of the fine, which application was also dismissed by the learned High

Court Judge.

6) Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned High Court Judge of Tangalle, the

Petitioner has filed the instant revision application seeking to have the orders of the

High Court of Tangalle and Magistrate court of Walasmulla revised.

7) The law relating to revision applications is well established. Revision being a

discretionary remedy is available only on proving the existence of exceptional

circumstances which shocks the conscience of the court.

8) In Wijesingha v. Tharmarathnam Sri Skantha Law Rep. Vol IV page 47 it was held:

‘Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the

application discloses exceptional circumstances which shock the conscience of

the court.

CA/HCC/0021/2023

9) As stated in Vanik Incorporation Ltd vs. Jayasekare [1997] 2 Sri LR 365,

revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has occurred

due to fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but only when a strong case is

made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of justice.

10) In Cadermenpulle vs. Ceylon Paper Sacks Ltd [2001] 3Sri LR 112, it was held that:

The existence of exceptional circumstances is a pre condition for the exercise

of the powers of revision; and absence of exceptional circumstances in any

given situation results in refusal of remedies.

11) In Dharmarathne & Another vs. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd. & Others [2003] 3 Sri

LR 34, Gamini Amaratunga J. emphasised the importance of establishing the

existence of exceptional circumstances as follows:

a. Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the court

selects the cases in respect of which the extraordinary method of rectification

should be adopted. If such a selection process is not there revisionary

jurisdiction of the court will become a gateway of every litigant to make a

second appeal in the garb of revision application or to make an appeal in

situations where the legislature has not given a right of appeal.

b. The practice of court is to insist on the existence of exceptional circumstances

for the exercise of revisionary powers has taken deep root in our law and has

got hardened into a rule which should not be lightly disturbed

12) It is with these legal principles in mind, I shall now consider the present application.

13) The exceptional circumstances urged by the Petitioner are as follows:

(a) The learned High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate has failed to

consider the Judgments in cases bearing No. SC/SPL/LA 176/2016 dated

27.10.2016 and the Judgment bearing No, CA/86/2009 dated 15.11.2011

where it was held that a State cost can be imposed instead of the fine and/or

the same can be done even when there is a finding of guilt;

CA/HCC/0021/2023

5 | P a g e

(b) The learned High Court Judge had failed to consider that he is bound by the

Judgments of SC/SPL/LA 176/2016 dated 27.10.2016 and the Judgment

bearing No. 86/2009 dated 15.11.2011 wherein he has not even considered the

same which in itself is illegal;

(c) The learned High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate failed to consider

the repercussions or grave prejudice caused to the Petitioner (by the fine

imposed, and not by the conviction) where he would lose his employment and

the benefits he has earned after serving in the army inclusive of time of the

battle;

(d) The learned High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate failed to consider

that following the above authorities justice would be met by converting the

fine of Rs. 8000/- to a State cost as sought by the Petitioner considering all the

circumstances of the case which would not have caused any prejudice to any

party;

(e) The learned High Court Judge has erred when not even issuing formal notices

as considering the circumstances the application made on both legal and

sympathetic grounds could have been considered as well;

(f) The learned High Court Judge has erred in law and fact by not considering that

the learned Magistrate of Walasmulla has failed to take into consideration that

not converting the fine imposed on the Petitioner to a State cost would end the

22 years of career of the Petitioner as an army soldier.

14) Therefore, the main ground advanced by the Petitioner in support of the present

application is that both the learned High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate have

failed to consider the relevancy of the Judgments in cases bearing No. SC/SPL/LA

176/2016 dated 27.10.2016 and the Judgment bearing No, CA/86/2009 dated

15.11.2011 wherein it was held that a State cost can be imposed instead of the fine

and/or the same can be done even when there is a finding of guilt.

15) The Respondents, on the other hand, have submitted that applications made in those

cases to convert the fine to a State cost have been made prior to the conclusion of the

CA/HCC/0021/2023

6 | P a g e

case and they did not concern the offences under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance.

16) It is important to note that the learned High Court Judge in his Order dated

27.06.2024, has mentioned that, for the Magistrate to impose a State cost under

section 306 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act (hereinafter referred to as the

“CCPA”), the Accused should not have been found guilty for the offence he was

charged.

17) However, in the present case, the Petitioner has pleaded guilty on 08.04.2024,

subsequent to which he has been imposed a fine of Rs. 8000/- and a default sentence

of two months’ imprisonment by the learned Magistrate of Walasmulla. The

application to convert the aforesaid fine to a State cost was made by the learned

Counsel for the Accused, subsequent to the conviction (eight days after the date of the

Judgment) , i.e. on 16.04.2024. Therefore, the learned High Court Judge had stated

that the learned Magistrate was correct in holding that such application to convert the

fine to a State cost cannot be allowed as the matter was already concluded and the

Accused was found guilty.

18) In Illayathmaby Naguleskaran v Attorney General SC SPL/LA/176/2016 (SC

Minutes dated 27.10.2016), the Supreme Court granted leave on the questions of law

raised by the learned Counsel for the Accused-Appellant and further reduced the fine

of Rs. 65,000/- imposed by the learned Magistrate to 50,000/-.

19) However, even after the appeal was allowed, the matter was once again mentioned to

make an application on behalf of the Appellant to vary the aforesaid order given by

the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the Supreme Court by its Order dated 21.03.2017,

allowed the said application made by the Counsel for the Appellant to vary the word

‘fine’ to read as ‘State costs’, thereby treating the fifty thousand Rupee fine imposed

on the Accused-Appellant by its previous order as State costs.

20) Furthermore, in Mohamed Mustapha Faisz v Attorney General CA 86/2009 dated

15.11.2011, the Accused-Appellant was a government teacher who has been indicted

before the High Court of Ampara under section 308 A (2) of the Penal Code for

causing cruelty to children. After the trial, the learned High Court Judge has

convicted the Accused-Appellant for the said offence and imposed a two and half

CA/HCC/0021/2023

7 | P a g e

years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1000/- and a default sentence of six

months’ imprisonment. Additionally, the Court also ordered the Accused-Appellant to

pay a sum of Rs. 10,000/- as compensation and to serve two years of imprisonment in

the event of default. The Accused- Appellant did not contest the conviction, but

sought some relief regarding the sentence imposed on him. Exercising the discretion

of the Court in favor of the Accused-Appellant, Lecamwasam J reduced the term of

imprisonment from two and half years to two years and suspend the term for a period

of five years. Most importantly, he ordered the fine of Rs. 1000/- to be treated as State

costs.

21) Therefore, it is important to note that in both these cases, the Court have made the

order to treat the fines imposed on the appellants as State costs after those cases were

concluded and the appellants were found guilty by the trial court. Especially, in

Illayathmaby Naguleskaran v Attorney General SC SPL/LA/176/2016, the

application made to vary ‘fines’ as ‘State costs’ by the Counsel was entertained by a

different bench at a subsequent stage, even after the appeal was allowed by the

Supreme Court.

22) Furthermore, in the Revision Application dated 27.05.2024, preferred to the High

Court of Tangalle, one of the grounds adduced by the Petitioner to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Court was the failure of the learned Magistrate to

consider the Judgments in cases bearing No. SC/ SPL /LA/176/2016 dated 27.10.2016

and the Judgment bearing No, CA/86/2009 dated 15.11.2011 which affirm the

position that the Court has the discretion to impose a State cost instead of a fine even

when there is a finding of guilt against the accused. However, despite his attention

being drawn to the above case law precedents, the learned High Court Judge has not

discussed the applicability of these two precedents or even considered them in his

Order dated 27.06.2024.

23) Instead, he has acted on the misguided notion that, in order to impose State costs

under section 306 of the CCPA, the accused should not have been convicted for the

offence he was charged, which in my view is a serious omission amounting to a

miscarriage of justice that warrants the intervention of this Court.

24) Another ground advanced by the Petitioner is that the learned High Court Judge and

the learned Magistrate failed to consider the repercussions or grave prejudice caused

CA/HCC/0021/2023

8 | P a g e

to the Petitioner (by the fine imposed, and not by the conviction) where he would lose

his employment and the benefits he has earned after serving in the army inclusive of

time of the battle.

25) In the present application, the Petitioner has been in army for last 22 years with an

unblemished record. No previous conviction for any kind of offence has been reported

against the Petitioner. In the affidavit, it is stated that consequent to the fine imposed

on the Petitioner, he would lose his job and other employment benefits accrued to him

during his career with the Sri Lanka Army. It is also stated that it would adversely

affect his financial stability after the retirement, and also directly affects his family

and children financially.

26) In the aforesaid circumstances, imposing a State cost, may be a way to mitigate harsh

consequences of a monetary fine, such as a loss of pension entitlement, by

substituting it with a different punitive measure like State costs, as noted by this Court

previously in Geegana Gamage Chamara Nilanga v Attorney General CA

HCC/112/2020 (CA Minutes 18. 07.2022):

The appellant is an army soldier, and if a fine is imposed, it would affect his

employment as a government servant which may result him been deprived of

his livelihood. Such a situation would affect his family members and may

change his life altogether.

27) Also, in Mohamed Mustapha Faisz v Attorney General it was held by Lecamwasam

J as follows:

After all, the justice cannot be for one side alone, but must be for both as

espoused by Eleanor Roosvelt. The Accused-Appellant is a public servant and

should not be deprived of his employment due to a solitary incident that had

taken place without any premeditation and moreover, because there is an

absence of evidence of prior similar behavior.

28) Considering the triviality of the offence committed by the Petitioner and the

disproportionate consequences that he will have to face due to imposition of a fine, I

allow the fine of Rs. 8000/- imposed on the Petitioner to be treated as State costs. This

Revision Application is allowed to that extent.
