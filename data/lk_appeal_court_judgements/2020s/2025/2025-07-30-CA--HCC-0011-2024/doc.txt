JUDGMENT

1. The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as 'the appellant') was indicted in the High

2. The trial was conducted before the Judge of the High Court without a jury. Upon

conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge convicted the Appellant and

accordingly, imposed death sentence on him.

3. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the appellant has preferred the

present appeal. The grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant are as follows:

a. The learned High Court Judge has not taken into account the inter-se

contradictions of the prosecution evidence;

b. The learned High Court Judge has failed to pay due attention to the

submissions made by the defense;

c. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the weaknesses and want

of credibility of the prosecution evidence; and

d. The judgment is contrary to the evidence led at the trial. 4. In the appeal, counsel for the Appellant primarily argued that the Learned High Court

Judge failed to address the issue of mens rea and the accused's knowledge, particularly

in light of the autopsy report, which does not support a finding of murder. It was further

submitted that the death occurred three days after the alleged assault, and that it was the

Appellant who took the deceased to the hospital. Based on these facts, it was argued that

the Appellants subsequent conduct also demonstrates that he did not have a murderous

intention at the time of the assault.

5. Opposing the Appellant's argument, it was submitted on behalf of the Respondent that,

even if the Appellant did not intend to cause the death, he cannot be exonerated from

the charge of murder, as the injuries sustained by the deceased were sufficient, in the

ordinary course of nature, to cause death.

6. The Respondents placed much reliance in Withana and Another vs The Republic

[2007] (1) SLR 169 and Gunasiri & Two Others vs Republic of Sri Lanka [2009] SLR

39.

7. In view of the arguments advanced by both parties, the issue of paramount importance

to be determined in the present appeal is whether the Appellants conviction for murder

can be sustained, given the extent of the injuries observed on the deceased and the

manner in which the Appellant acted. It is also pertinent to examine whether the blows

inflicted by the Appellant directly contributed to the death of the deceased, or whether

CA/HCC/0011/2024

3 | P a g e

the death occurred as a result of a supervening factor arising from the injuries inflicted

by the Appellant.

8. Section 294 of the Penal Code reads:

Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder-

Firstly - if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing

death; or

Secondly - If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender

knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused;

or

Thirdly - If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the

bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of

nature to cause death; or

Fourthly - If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that

it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause

death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of

causing death or such injury as aforesaid.

9. It is clear that the intention contemplated under the first limb of Section 294 of the Penal

Code is the intention to cause death, commonly referred to as murderous intention. In

contrast, the intention under the third limb of Section 294 refers to the intention to cause

bodily injury not necessarily death. However, the bodily injury inflicted must be

sufficient, in the ordinary course of nature, to cause death. The emphasis under the third

limb is therefore on the sufficiency of the injury to cause death in the ordinary course of

nature, rather than on the intention to cause death itself.

10. At the trial, the prosecution evidence revealed that the assault occurred when the

Appellant insisted that the deceased take her meals, which she refused. It was also

established that, following the assault, the Appellant himself sponged the bruised areas

of the deceased with hot water and accompanied her to the hospital. These actions

indicate that the Appellant did not act with any murderous intention.

11. Therefore, the culpability of the Appellant in the present case must be assessed under

the third limb of Section 294, namely, whether the bodily injury intended and inflicted

CA/HCC/0011/2024

4 | P a g e

by the Appellant was sufficient, in the ordinary course of nature, to cause the death of

the deceased.

12. In Virsa Singh v State of Punjab AIR (1958) SC 465 at 467 His Lordship Justice Bose

said: "No one has a licence to run around inflicting injuries that are sufficient to cause

death in the ordinary course of nature and claim that they are not guilty of murder. If

they inflict injuries of that kind, they must face the consequences; and they can only

escape if it can be shown, or reasonably deduced, that the injury was accidental or

otherwise unintentional."

13. The aforementioned case establishes that a person accused of murder cannot claim he

lacked the intent to cause death merely because he only intended to inflict bodily injury,

if the injury inflicted is, in the ordinary course of nature, sufficient to cause death. To

elaborate, if the injury that the offender intended to cause and did in fact cause is

sufficient, in the ordinary course of nature, to result in death, the offence amounts to

murder, regardless of whether the offender intended to cause death or had any subjective

knowledge of the likely consequences. However, there must be a clear link between the

appellants act and the victims death. This is known as the chain of causation.

14. It is important to emphasize that in cases where a persons death is not directly

attributable to the initial injury but is instead linked to a subsequent supervening

condition, the prosecution must establish not merely a likelihood, but a high

probabilitythat the supervening condition resulted from the original injury and

ultimately caused the death. This standard ensures that, in a charge of murder, a direct

causal connection between the initial injury and the resulting death is proven beyond a

reasonable doubt.

15. In State of Maharashtra v Arun Savalaram 1989 - CR LJ 191, Indian Court observed

thus:

"For the application of this clause it must be first established that an injury is

caused, next it must be established objectively what the nature of that injury in

the ordinary course of nature is. If the injury is found to be sufficient to cause

death one test is satisfied. Then it must be proved that there was an intention to

inflict that very injury and not some other injury and that it was not accidental

or unintentional. If this is also held against the offender the offence of murder is

established.

16. In the instant case, it is evidenced that the Appellant struck the deceased once with a

torch. However, the deceased did not suffer any fractures to the head or any other bones.

Dr. Shalindra Shali Attanayake, who conducted the autopsy, clearly stated that although

there was evidence of blunt trauma to the head, it could not be considered a blow

inflicted with heavy force, as no fractures were observed on the skull.

17. Furthermore, Dr. Attanayake observed an acute-on-chronic right-sided subdural

hemorrhage in the deceased. She further explained that, since it was chronic, it would

have been present for at least three weeks.

18. According to Dr Attanayake, an acute-on-chronic subdural hemorrhage is a condition

where new bleeding occurs on top of an existing chronic subdural hematoma. In essence,

a patient with a chronic subdural hematoma, which is a collection of blood and blood

breakdown products that has been present for weeks or months, experiences a new bleed

into that same space.

19. From her evidence, it can be gleaned that the cause of death was not solely the blow

struck by the Appellant, but rather the chronic subdural hemorrhage, which was

precipitated by an acute subdural hemorrhage. Thus, it is evident that a supervening

factor contributed to the death of the deceased

20. She further testified as follows:

21. The death occurred on 21.02.2015 at around 9:15 p.m. The autopsy report bearing

number SA/GHK/PM/14/ dated 23.02.2015 was marked as P2 in evidence. While

CA/HCC/0011/2024

6 | P a g e

referring to the postmortem report, the JMO testified and explained the extent of the

injuries observed on the deceased and the cause of death.

22. According to the postmortem report, the external injuries are described as follows:

1. 2 x 1.5 cm contusion on the front of left side of forehead upper area it is 6 cm

away from the midline and 5 cm above to the left eyebrow.

2. 3.5 cm x 0.3 mm abrasion on back of left elbow.

3. 0.5 x 0.5 cm abrasion front of right knee 36 cm above to the heel.

23. What is apparent from the above evidence is that it was not the contusion that caused

the subdural hemorrhage, but rather a sudden movement of the brain that damaged the

blood vessels and resulted in the hemorrhage.

24. The above opinion was further confirmed by Prosecution Witness No. 2, who stated in

her testimony that the appellant aggressively pushed the deceased, causing her to fall to

the ground. Thus, it is most probable that the act of pushing the deceased, causing her

to fall to the floor, resulted in an acute subdural hemorrhage placed over a chronic

subdural hemorrhage, which ultimately led to her death.

25. Thus, it is difficult to conclude that the appellant acted with any murderous intention

when pushing the deceased. More importantly, as the JMO clearly stated that, apart from

two abrasions and one contusion, no other injuries were observed on the body of the

deceased, there is insufficient evidence to infer a murderous intention on the part of the

appellant.

26. Furthermore, according to the JMOs findings, there was no skull fracture or fracture of

the neck bones. Similarly, there was no evidence of fractures in any other bones. The

cause of death, as stated in the report, was an acute-on-chronic right-sided subdural

hemorrhage resulting from blunt force trauma to the head.

27. It is clear that the immediate cause of deathnamely, acute-on-chronic right-sided

subdural hemorrhage, which supervenedwas a likely consequence of an injury

inflicted by the Appellant. Nevertheless, the more critical issue to be determined is

whether a conviction for murder can be justified on the basis of the evidence presented

by the prosecution. As reflected in the prosecution's own evidence, the Appellants

subsequent conduct does not demonstrate the presence of a murderous intention at the

CA/HCC/0011/2024

7 | P a g e

time of the incident. More importantly, the injury inflicted by the Appellant would not

have caused the death of the deceased had the pre-existing chronic subdural hemorrhage

not been present. Clearly, the Appellant had no knowledge of the deceaseds chronic

subdural hemorrhage at the time of the assault.

28. The medical evidence clearly indicates that the Appellant did not use significant force

when assaulting the deceased with the torch. Moreover, there is no compelling evidence

to suggest that the injury resulting from the assault can be directly attributed to the death

of the deceased. In other words, there is no evidence to show that the injury inflicted by

the Appellant alone was sufficient, in the ordinary course of nature, to cause death.

Therefore, it is difficultif not impossibleto apply the third limb of Section 296 of

the Penal Code to the present case.

29. It is noteworthy, that the learned High Court Judge in his judgment concluded that the

deceased had suffered skull fractures and internal hemorrhage as a result of the assault

by the Appellant, findings that are totally contrary to the opinion of the JMO. In other

words, the High Court Judge appears to have based his conclusions on factors that were

not supported by the evidence.

30. Moreover, in the judgment the learned High Court Judge has come to a finding that the

appellant had hit the deceased with a broom until it was broken, which had not been

seen by any of the eye witnesses. In fact, PW 1 has clearly stated that he never saw that

the appellant hitting the deceased with a broom. The witness testified as follows:

31. Regrettably, the learned High Court Judge failed to explain how the appellant could be

found guilty under Section 296 of the Penal Code. More importantly, the impugned

judgment does not set out the reasons for the appellants conviction for murder, nor does

it specify under which limb of Section 294 the act committed by the appellant would

fall.

32. As held in Vithana & Another vs The Republic of Sri Lanka [2007] (1) SLR 169, the

ingredients that must be proved by the prosecution in order to prove a charge of

murder under the 3rd limb of Section 294 are that:

(i) The accused inflicted a bodily injury on the victim.

(ii) The victim died as a result of the above bodily injury.

(iii) The accused had the intention to cause the bodily injury.

(iv) The above injury was sufficient to cause the death of the victim in the

ordinary course of nature

33. The JMOs evidence suggests that the subdural hemorrhage occurred as a result of a

sudden movement of the brain. Therefore, it is evident that the appellant did not possess

any murderous intent, nor did he have knowledge of the likelihood that such an injury

would occur when he pushed the deceased.

34. In Mendis v Queen - 54 NLR 177, it was held that as the injured man's death was not

immediately referable to the injury actually inflicted but was traced to some condition

which arose as a supervening link in the chain of causation, it was essential in such cases

that the prosecution should, in presenting a charge of murder, be in a position to place

evidence before the Court to establish that " in the ordinary course of nature " there was

a very great probability (as opposed to a mere likelihood) (a) of the supervening

condition arising as a consequence of the injury inflicted, and also (b) of such

supervening condition resulting in death.

35. In Farook vs A.G. [2006] (3) SLR 174, it was held inter alia:

The determinant factor is the intentional injury which must be sufficient to cause

death in the ordinary course of nature. that is to say. if the probability of death

is not so high. the offence does not fall within murder but within culpable

homicide not amounting to murder or something less.

36. In the instant case, it is evident that the appellant struck the deceased with a plastic torch

and then pushed her, causing her to fall to the floor. As stated by the JMO, the chronic

CA/HCC/0011/2024

9 | P a g e

subdural hemorrhage that pre-existed in the deceased was precipitated by the sudden

movement of the brain. The JMO categorically stated that the contusion on the head had

no connection whatsoever with the subdural hemorrhage observed in the deceased.

Thus, there is hardly any evidence to satisfy the criteria stipulated under the third limb

of Section 294 of the Penal Code.

37. In the absence of any conclusive proof that the appellant was entertaining an intention

to cause the death of the deceased, the more appropriate finding is a conviction for the

offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of knowledge,

punishable under section 297 of the Penal Code.

38. Therefore, having regard to all the circumstances of the present case, I shall set aside

the conviction and sentence for murder of the learned High Court Judge of Kalutara

dated 11.10.2023, and convict him on the basis of knowledge under section 297 of the

Penal Code.

39. Accordingly, I impose a sentence of 10 years rigorous imprisonment on the appellant

and a fine of Rs 50000.00 with a default sentence of further three years.

40. Considering the age of the appellant and he has no previous convictions and is

incarcerated from the date of the conviction, I further order that the prison term shall

operate from 11.10.2023, i.e., from the date of the conviction.

41. Accordingly, the appeal is partly allowed.
