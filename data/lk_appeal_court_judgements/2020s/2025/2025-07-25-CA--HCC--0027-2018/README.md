JUDGMENT

1. The only question to be determined in this appeal is whether the conviction for murder

can be reduced to a culpable homicide not amounting to murder, in light of the evidence

adduced at the trial.

Background to the appeal:

2. The appellant was indicted for committing the murder of his wife Usliyanage Piyaseeli

on or about 15.04.2008, an offence punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code.

When the indictment was read out to the accused, he pleaded not guilty. The trial

commenced before the Judge of the High Court of Gampaha. For the prosecution, 5

witnesses testified. The accused made a dock statement and a daughter of the deceased

testified for the defense.

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge found the accused guilty of

the charge. Accordingly, the accused was convicted and sentenced to death. This appeal

is preferred against the said conviction and sentence.

4. Although there were several grounds of appeal, during the argument, the counsel for the

accused informed that he would only contest the conviction for murder as there was

sufficient evidence to reduce the charge to culpable homicide not amounting to murder

committed under grave and sudden provocation.

5. It must be noted that in his dock statement, the accused admitted the cutting of the

deceased neck by using a bread knife, but stated that it was done under grave and

sudden provocation as the deceased was with her paramour when the accused came

home.

6. Hence, the issue of paramount importance to be determined in the present appeal is

whether the circumstances under which the accused causing injuries to the deceased

would be sufficient to infer that it was done under grave and sudden provocation.

HCC/0027/2018

7. Although the accused stated that he saw the deceased with her paramour shortly before

he attacked the deceased, there was no evidence forthcoming to that effect during the

trial.

8. As evinced by the testimony of the defense witness, the accused had a suspicion that

the deceased was having and illicit relationship with an employee at the deceaseds

work place. On one occasion, the defense witness, her husband and the accused had

gone to the deceaseds work place and inquired about it from the person concerned but

he denied any such affair.

9. Furthermore, there was no evidence to establish that the person they had met at the

deceaseds workplace was the same individual who was with the deceased on the day of

the incident, as alleged by the accused in his dock statement.

10. Moreover, if the accused had seen a person named Dayananda with whom the deceased

allegedly had an illicit affair, talking to the deceased and then running away upon

seeing the accused, it is not sensible to believe that the deceased would have remained

at the same spot until being assaulted by the accused with an axe.

11. In this regard, the evidence of the JMO Dr Jayaweera Bandara, who conducted the

autopsy of the deceased would be also of much relevance. The witness whilst referring

to the autopsy report marked as P 09, explained the extent of the injuries observed on

the body of the deceased.

12. According to the JMOs evidence, there was only one injury, which almost severed the

head from the neck. According to his opinion, the cut injury he observed on the body

was caused by a heavy sharp weapon like an axe and also was inflicted with a severe

force. He testified as follows:

13. More importantly, during cross-examination by the defense counsel, the JMO

unequivocally ruled out the possibility that such a grave injury could have been caused

by a sharp cutting knife similar to a bread knife. He categorically stated that the fatal

injury could not have been caused by a bread knife, but rather by a heavy, sharp cutting

weapon. He testified further as follows:

: ?

: . . . .

14. Thus, the JMO s testimony negates the accuseds version that he cut the neck of the

deceased with a bread knife.

15. In Bakhtawar v State of Haryana AIR 1979 - SC 1006 the Indian Supreme Court held

as follows:

"For the commission of the offence of murder it is not necessary that the accused

should have the intention to cause death. It is now well settled that if it is proved

that the accused had the intention to inflict the injuries actually suffered by the

victim and such injuries are found to be sufficient in the ordinary course of

nature to cause death, the ingredients of clause Thirdly, of sec. 300 of the Indian

Penal Code are fulfilled and the accused must be held guilty of murder

punishable under sec. 302 of the Indian Penal Code."

(Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code is in terms identical to sec. 294 of the Ceylon

Penal Code.)

16. It is also significant to note that the accused, in his dock statement, claimed that he

returned home around 3:30 p.m. and saw the deceased talking with a person named

Dayananda. He stated that, having lost his self-control, he used a bread knife allegedly

HCC/0027/2018

6 | P a g e

found suddenly on the table, to cut the deceaseds neck. However, according to the

evidence of the prosecution witnesses, the incident occurred around 10:30 p.m., a fact

that remained unchallenged. If this is the case, the accuseds version, that he inflicted

the fatal injury at around 3:30 p.m. is demonstrably false.

17. Conversely, if the accused did return home at 3:30 p.m. and saw the deceased chatting

with Dayananda, then he had ample time to regain his self-control, given that the

incident occurred some seven hours later, at approximately 10:30 p.m.

18. The testimony of PW1, PW2, and PW4 confirmed that the killing took place around

10:30 p.m. on 15.04.2008, and not at 3:30 p.m. as alleged by the accused in his dock

statement. It is noteworthy that, during cross-examination, the time of the incident was

never disputed by the defense.

19. In Dadimuni Indrasena & Dadimuni Wimalasena v AG (2008) Sisira de Abrew J

stated that: Whenever the evidence given by a witness on a material point is not

challenged in cross examination it has to be concluded that such evidence is not

disputed and is accepted by the opponent.

20. This principle is enunciated in Pilippu Mandige Nalaka Krishantha Kumara Tissera v.

AG (2007) and is in line with the approach adopted by Indian Courts.

21. In Sarwan Singh v State of Punjab (2002) (AIR SC 111), it was held that:

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to avail

himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross examination, it must follow

that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted ,

22. In Motilal v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1990) (CLJ NOC 125 MP) it was held that the

absence of cross examination of Prosecution Witnesses of certain facts leads to

inference of admission of that fact.

23. Thus, it can be safely concluded that the time of the incident was established as 10:30

p.m., a fact also accepted by the defense, and not 3:30 p.m. as claimed by the accused

in his dock statement. Furthermore, the JMOs testimony, that the cut injury found on

the deceaseds body could not have been caused by a bread knife, as alleged by the

accused remains unchallenged. The JMO has adequately explained the reasons behind

HCC/0027/2018

7 | P a g e

his opinion regarding the nature of the weapon used to inflict the neck injury on the

deceased, and this opinion also remains uncontested.

24. Therefore, the dock statement of the accused is not only unworthy of belief but also

fails to raise any doubt in the prosecutions case, and must be rejected in its entirety.

These facts clearly indicate that the appellant has not discharged the burden of proof

required by law.

25. For the defense of grave and sudden provocation to succeed, the provocation must be

both unexpected and instant, allowing no time for reflection or planning. In other

words, the act that triggered the provocation must be of such a serious nature that it

would cause a reasonable person to lose self-control. If there was a time gap between

the provocation and the act, the defense would fail, as this would suggest a cooling-off

period and the possibility of premeditation.

26. In the present case, it has been established that the killing occurred around 10:30 p.m.

Therefore, if the accused returned home at 3:30 p.m. and witnessed the deceased having

a conversation with one Dayananda, he had a cooling-off period of approximately

seven hours before the incident. This clearly indicates that the accused is not entitled to

rely on the defense of grave and sudden provocation.

27. Furthermore, the axe recovered consequent to the accuseds statement, was shown to

the doctor during questioning by the state counsel. The doctor expressed the opinion

that, given the nature and extent of the cut injury observed on the deceased's body, the

axe could have been the weapon used to inflict the fatal injury. This position remains

unchallenged.

28. The circumstances and the Appellants own statements indicate that he had not only

regained his self-control but was also planning for the future. Nearly six hours had

elapsed between the time the Appellant arrived at his house and the time the murder

took place. Therefore, even if he had not regained his composure earlier, there was

ample time for him to do so. On the contrary, the Appellants conduct clearly

demonstrates that the murder was deliberate and calculated.

29. In Mancini and Director of Public Prosecutions (on Behalf of His Majesty) [1941]

UKHL J1016-1 the court established a key principle regarding provocation and murder.

The case clarified that provocation, while potentially reducing a murder charge to

manslaughter, must be "grave and sudden" and sufficient to cause a reasonable person

HCC/0027/2018

8 | P a g e

to lose self-control. The court emphasized that the provocation must be so severe that it

temporarily deprives the person of their self-control, leading them to commit an

unlawful act resulting in death.

30. As stated earlier, this appeal was argued on a limited ground, namely, whether the

offence of murder could be reduced to culpable homicide not amounting to murder, on

the basis that the appellant acted under sudden and grave provocation.

31. Once the prosecution has proved the charges beyond reasonable doubt, the burden

shifts to the accused to establish any exceptions upon which he relies. In the present

case, it was argued on behalf of the appellant that the learned High Court Judge had

failed to properly evaluate the appellants dock statement and erred in rejecting it.

32. In the judgment dated 02.02.2018, the learned High Court Judge has duly considered

the dock statement and clearly explained why it was devoid of truth. Furthermore, the

learned Judge concluded that no sufficient evidence had been presented to establish that

the offence was committed under grave and sudden provocation.

33. In K.M. Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1962 SC 605, the Supreme Court

discussed the elements to be considered when grave and sudden provocation is pleaded.

The provocation must be both grave and sudden. The accused must have acted

immediately upon receiving the provocation, before regaining self-control. There must

be a genuine loss of self-control, and the response must be proportionate to the

provocation. If the reaction is excessive or brutal, the court may reject the defence.

34. In the instant case, a careful examination of the evidence adduced by both the

prosecution and the defence reveals that none of the essential elements of grave and

sudden provocation articulated in the aforesaid authorities have been proved.

35. The extent of the injury, the brutality evident in the act, the absence of evidence

supporting grave and sudden provocation, and, more importantly, the falsity of the dock

statement, do not persuade me to accept the arguments advanced on behalf of the

appellant.

36. Based on the foregoing analysis, the appellant's conviction under Section 296 of the

Penal Code and the death sentence imposed by the High Court are found to be justified.

There are absolutely no grounds for interference. Hence, we affirm the judgment and

sentence of the learned Judge of the High Court of Gampaha.
