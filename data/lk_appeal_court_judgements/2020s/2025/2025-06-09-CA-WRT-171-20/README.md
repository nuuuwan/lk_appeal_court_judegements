JUDGEMENT

K. M. G. H. KULATUNGA, J.

1. The petitioner inter alia is seeking a writ of certiorari to quash a grant

made under the Land Development Ordinance and the entries in the

Register made under the hand of the 1st respondent, marked A5(b) and

A6 as to the registration of the nomination and succession of the 4th

respondent.

Facts.

2. The petitioner, the 4th respondent, and the 5th respondent are three

brothers of a family of five siblings. The petitioner is the eldest of the

three. Their father, Jamis Signo, was married to Podimanike. The

petitioner refers to his father as Kanugala Mudiyanselage Jamis Signo.

WRT/0171/20

Page 3 of 13

The name Jamis Signo is repeated in that form throughout the petition.

However, on the perusal of the Birth Certificate [marked A2(a)] the name

appears to be Kanugala Mudiyanselage Emis Signo ( ).

Similarly, on the Death Certificate (marked A3) the name appears in the

same form. Therefore, it is apparent that the correct name of the father

of the petitioner is Kanugala Mudiyanselage Emis Signo.

3. Emis Signo died on 26.07.1970. There is no evidence of making any

nomination of a successor prior to the demise of Emis Signo. However,

on 05.02.1973, his wife Podimenikes name had been inserted as permit

holder to the permit 3R1. On the same day i.e., 05.02.1973, a

nomination of a successor has been made by endorsement on the

permit 3R1, that of K. G. Abeywardhana (son 16 years). Thus, if at all,

is Podimenike who had made this nomination by endorsement at the

point of receiving the permit. This nomination is also entered in the land

ledger 3R1A which confirms the fact of the said nomination and the

date.

4. Then, under Section 19(4) of the Land Development Ordinance (LDO),

Podimenike was the recipient of a grant dated 26.03.1986 bearing no.

ka/PR 4341 in respect of the said land. Podimanike as the grantee

appears to have nominated the 4th and the 5th respondents as

successors which nominations have been registered in October 2004,

vide A5(b). The 4th respondent had been named as the successor and

the same is registered (vide A6). The petitioner, being aggrieved by the

said nomination and the registration thereof, has preferred this

application inter alia seeking to quash the said entries, A5(b) and A6.

Podimenikes stakes vis--vis 3R1.

5. The petitioner claims that his father initially received a permit under

Section 19(2) and then was the recipient of a grant under Section 19(4)

of the Ordinance. However, no copy or any reference to such a grant is

found in any of the documents submitted by all parties in the course of

WRT/0171/20

Page 4 of 13

this application. It is common ground that the original permit issued is

dated 13.09.1950, marked and produced by the 1st to 3rd respondents

as 3R1. According to paragraph 3(ii) of the objections of the 1st to 3rd

respondents it is averred that there no disposition made to Emis Signo

in terms of the permit itself (3R1). However, the name of Emis Signos

wife, W. A. Podimanike, had been interpolated on 05.02.1973, upon

striking off Bulugoda Gamaralalage Punchi Manika a third party on

the permit 3R1. Therefore, on the face of this permit 3R1, it is apparent

that this had been initially issued to a third party (Bulugoda

Gamaralalage Punchi Manika) and at a subsequent point of time, the

petitioners mother has been inserted and substituted as the permit

holder. The 1st to 3rd respondents at paragraph 3(iii) of the objections

aver that, The said permit appears HOWEVER to have been issued as

a direct de novo permit once again to W. A. Podimenike (allegedly the

spouse of the Jamis Signo referred to in the petition) on 05.02.1973 even

though the basis of such issuance of such permit at the time is also not

apparent in the records maintained in the Divisional Secretariat. Then

at paragraph 5(ii) the respondents further aver that, In any event whilst

the name of Emis Signo appears in the land ledger of the time (1954), the

original permit in respect of the same land had been in the name of a

third party (Bulugoda Gamaralalage Punchi Manika) seemingly

unrelated to any of the parties to this application and issued as a de novo

permit to W. A. Podimanike. Thus, Podimenike is not a successor qua

spouse but a direct recipient of the permit 3R1.

6. Podimanike herself died on 19.07.2018. The petitioner claims to be

lawfully entitled to succeed by nomination. The name of the nominee

by endorsement appears as K. G. Abeywardhana. However, the

petitioners name is K. M. Abeywardhana. The Learned DSG Yuresha

Fernando, based on this discrepancy, submitted that the petitioners

name does not appear as the nominee successor and also that as there

is no evidence of the said nomination of the petitioner being registered

as required by Section 58 of the LDO, there cannot be a valid

WRT/0171/20

Page 5 of 13

nomination enforceable by this Court. Section 58 of the LDO reads as

follows:

58. (1) A document (other than a last will) whereby the

nomination of a successor is effected or cancelled shall not be valid

unless and until it has been registered by the Registrar of Lands

of the district in which the holding or land to which that document

refers is situated.

(2) Regulations may be made prescribing the procedure

for the registration of documents whereby nominations of

successors are effected or cancelled and for all matters connected

therewith or incidental thereto, including the registers which shall

be kept and the fees which shall be charged for such registration.

7. In Palate Gedera Gunadasa vs. Palate Gedera Merywathy [SC Appeal

No. 82/2008 (SCM 26.10.2010)], Her Ladyship Dr. Shirani

Bandaranayake, J (as she was then), held that according to Section 60

of the LDO (referred to above), a nomination would become effective

only if such nomination or cancellation is duly registered before the date

of death of the holding or the permit holder. Accordingly, a nomination

not registered prior to the death of the permit holder will not be effective.

It is settled law that the successor under the LDO has to be considered

in terms of Section 60 of the said Ordinance. As held in Madurasinghe

vs. Madurasinghe (1988) 2 SLR 142, the succession of the property

alienated on a permit under the LDO has to be necessarily considered

and decided on the basis of Section 60 of the Ordinance, which reads

as follows:

60. No nomination or cancellation of the nomination of a

successor shall be valid unless the document (other than a

last will) effecting such nomination or cancellation is duly

registered before the date of the death of the owner of the

holding or the permit-holder.

WRT/0171/20

Page 6 of 13

8. The learned DSG relying on Section 60 of the Ordinance, submitted that

a nomination or the cancellation thereof of a successor is not valid,

unless such nomination or the cancellation is duly registered before the

death of the owner of the holding or the permit holder. The operative

argument is that the petitioner has failed to place before this Court any

evidence of the registration of his nomination. As such, the apparent

nomination, referred to in documents 3R1, the permit, 3R1A, the land

ledger, and A1(a), the letter dated 21.12.2016 is not valid. As opposed

to that, the nominations of the 4th and the 5th respondents are

registered, and is therefore valid.

9. The respondents, having taken up the firm position that the permit

issued to Podimanike is a de novo permit, in the sense that Podimanike

did not succeed as the life interest holder qua spouse, is now taking up

a different position at the point of argument. According to the written

submission, it is submitted that Podimanike could not have made a

valid nomination in view of the provisions of Section 48A as she was the

spouse who succeeded. Podimenikes name is inserted to the permit

(3R1) almost 3 years after the death of Emis Signo. Emis Signos name

does not appear on the permit 3R1. The nomination of the petitioner by

endorsement is on 05.02.1973. This was well after the death of Emis

Signo. Thus, it is Podimanike who has made this nomination as a de

novo permit holder. Section 48A would thus have no application to the

nomination made by Podimanike. Accordingly, the nomination of the

petitioner by endorsement remains valid.

Discrepancy as to the name.

10. On the permit, as well as the ledger, the name of the nominee is K. G.

Abeywardhana. The petitioner is K. M. Abeywardhana. The second initial

G clearly appears to be erroneous and different. However, the

nomination clearly refers to the nominee as being the son who was

around 16 years. On a perusal of the birth certificate of the petitioner

A2 (a) it is evident that the petitioners date of birth is in 1955, and the

WRT/0171/20

Page 7 of 13

name is Abeywardhana. In 1973, he was around that age, and is the

only son of Podimanike named Abeywardhana. In these circumstances,

it is obvious and apparent that the nomination is of the petitioner,

notwithstanding an error in one of the initials.

The modes of nominating a successor under the LDO.

11. It is opportune at this juncture to consider the statutory provision and

the mode of nominating a successor in relation to permits and grants

under the Ordinance. As I observe, there are three modes by which the

nomination of a successor may be made by a permit holder or an owner

of the holding. They are: (1) nomination using the prescribed form

(Section 56); (2) nomination by a last will (Section 63); and then (3) a

recipient of a permit has a further option of making a nomination by

endorsement (Section 87).

12. Firstly, a permit holder or an owner of the holding may make a

nomination on the prescribed form which document requires it to be

then registered. As for nominations made by a last will, the immediate

registration is not necessary, however, within three months of the death

of the permit holder or the owner of the holding upon applying for

probate, the same should be registered (vide Sections 64 and 65 of the

LDO). However, as for nomination by endorsement, I see no requirement

of registration of such nomination separately. The nomination of

successor by endorsement is provided for by Section 87 of the

Ordinance, which reads thus:

87. A person to whom a Government Agent has agreed to

alienate land may nominate as his successor any person who

is entitled under this Ordinance to be so nominated, and the

name of such successor may be endorsed on the permit

before it is issued to the first-mentioned person, and the

Government Agent may upon being requested so to do by the

permit-holder cancel the name of such successor by an

WRT/0171/20

Page 8 of 13

endorsement on the permit and endorse on the permit the

name of any other person suggested by the permit-holder as

his successor.

13. According to the above, when the Government Agent (Divisional

Secretary) has agreed to alienate the land under this Ordinance, the

person entitled to such permit may nominate and name his successor

and the same may be endorsed on the permit before it is issued.

Therefore, the Ordinance makes specific provision that enables an

endorsement to be made at the point of issuing such permit. Document

3R1, the permit, which is the initial document produced in respect of

the land in question, at page 2 contains an endorsement as to the

nomination of the successor. It is K. G. Abeywardhana (son 16 years).

Therefore, in the present application, the petitioner appears as the

nominee successor endorsed on the permit. Podimanikes name has

been interpolated as the permit holder of 05.02.1973. This date appears

soon after the said interpolation. Similarly, the endorsement as to the

nomination of the successor appears also to have been made on the

same day, as evident from the date below the said endorsement on 3R1.

Therefore, the petitioner is the nominee by virtue of the endorsement

made on the permit under Section 87 of the Ordinance. The immediate

issue for determination is whether such a nomination requires to be

separately registered as required by Section 60.

14. As observed earlier, the respondents concede that the said permit was

issued to W. A. Podimenike on 05.02.1973, and this bears the name K.

G. Abeywardhana as the nominee successor (vide paragraph 3 (iv).

Respondents refer to this permit as a de novo permit issued to W. A.

Podimenike. Similarly, it is admitted that the grant bearing No.

ka/PR/4341 is in respect of the said land, had also been given to W. A.

Podimanike, on 27.03.1986. The respondents also accept and tender the

relevant ledger extract marked 3R2B.

WRT/0171/20

Page 9 of 13

15. The said documentation and the averments, establish that the

petitioner was in fact nominated as the successor by endorsement at the

point of issuing the permit 3R1 to W. A. Podimanike. It is Podimenike

who has nominated K. G. Abeywardhana as successor.

16. Then with the lapse of time, a grant has been made under Section 19(4)

of the Ordinance on 27.03.1986. In these circumstances, to my mind,

the separate registration of the nomination made by endorsement is not

required. The nomination made by endorsement on the original permit

would be valid and operative, notwithstanding the absence of any

separate registration. What Sections 58 and 60 require is the

registration of the document on which a nomination is made. It is not

the registration of the nomination. Hence, when a nomination is made

by endorsement on a permit when initially issued there is no separate

document making a nomination to be registered. It is the permit itself

that would contain the nomination and would be so registered.

Therefore, with the registration of the permit, the said nomination will

ipso facto be registered. The Government Agent (Divisional Secretary) is

required to cause the permit to be registered, vide Section 19 (3). This is

the rationale and reason for not requiring a separate registration of a

nomination made by endorsement.

17. This is confirmed by the provision of Section 56 of the LDO, which reads

as follows:

56. (1) The nomination of a successor and the cancellation of any

such nomination shall be effected by a document substantially in

the prescribed form executed and witnessed in triplicate before a

Government Agent, or a Registrar of Lands, or a divisional

Assistant Government Agent, or a notary, or a Justice of the

Peace.

(2) The provisions of subsection (1) shall not apply to any

nomination or cancellation of a successor made by last will in the

WRT/0171/20

Page 10 of 13

manner hereinafter provided, or to the nomination and cancellation

of a successor to a land alienated on a permit made in the manner

provided in section 87.

(3) A document by which the nomination of a successor or the

cancellation of any such nomination is effected under subsection

(1) shall not be deemed to be an instrument affecting land for the

purposes of the Registration of Documents Ordinance, nor shall the

provisions of Chapter II of that Ordinance apply to any person

before whom any such document is executed.

Subsection (2) puts it beyond doubt by stating that the provisions of

subsection (1) is not applicable to the nomination or cancellation of a

successor to a land alienated on a permit made in the manner provided

in Section 87.

18. In view of the objections raised by the learned DSG, it is necessary to

consider if the petitioner has been duly nominated as a lawful successor,

and if the said nomination remains valid upon the grant being issued.

19. The nomination of the petitioner is by endorsement on the initial permit

issued to Podimanike. Several years thereafter, a grant has been issued

under Section 19(4) of the LDO. Upon the said grant, the nomination of

the 4th and 5th respondents have been made. All these three nominations

appear and are reflected on the land ledger. However, upon the demise

of Podimanike, it appears that the nomination initially made on the

permit had not been considered in determining the successor.

20. The immediate legal issue is the validity of the nomination made on the

permit and the subsequent issue if a grant. Does the subsequent issue

of a grant extinguish and determine the initial nomination made under

the permit? This specific question was considered in M.W.D. Dayaratne

vs. M.W.D. Agosinno, SC Appeal No. 30/2004 and Piyasena vs.

Wijesinghe (2002) 2 SLR 242.

WRT/0171/20

Page 11 of 13

21. In the case of M.W.D. Dayaratne vs. M.W.D. Agosinno, His Lordship

S. N. Silva, C.J., held as follows:

In these circumstances, we are of the view that the 1st respondent

has made the order P7 on a proper application of the relevant

provisions and importantly, by giving effect to the wish of the

deceased allottee. Our attention has also been drawn to a

judgement of the Court of Appeal in Piyasena vs. Wijesinghe and

others (2002) 2 SLR 242 where the Court of Appeal has taken the

same view that on the basis that there is a lacuna in the law and

that the intention of the allottee should be given effect to. It is clear

from the provisions of the law that the change in the nature of the

holding from that of a permit to a grant is one process and it should

not be taken as two distinct processes for the purpose of annulling

a nomination that has been previously made.

22. Then, in Piyasena vs. Wijesinghe, Justice J. A. N. De Silva (P/CA) (as

he was then). His Lordship held that,

It is to be noted that the issuance of a grant changes status

of a permit holder to that of an "owner" who derives title to

the land in question (see section 2 of the Ordinance). By the

amending Act No. 27 of 1987 this interpretation of owner"

was extended to also cover "a permit holder who has paid

all sums which he is required to pay . . . and has complied

with all the other conditions specified in the permit". The

satisfaction of "paying all sums and complying with all

conditions entitles the permit holder to a grant which shall"

be issued in respect of the said land in terms of section 19

(4) of the same Act and I hold that the nomination of a

successor under the permit becomes converted to nomination

made by her as the owner of the land. In my view this

interpretation is in keeping with the spirit and intention of

the amending Act. A broader definition attributed to 80 the

term "owner" and the legal entitlement of a permit holder to

WRT/0171/20

Page 12 of 13

be regarded as such are salutary features of the

amendment.

23. In the above cases of Piyasena vs. Wijesinghe and M.W.D. Dayaratne

vs. M.W.D. Agosinno, it has been unequivocally held that the change in

the nature of the holding from that of a permit to a grant is one process

and should not be taken as two distinct processes for the purpose of

annulling a nomination that has been previously made.

24. In M.W.D. Dayaratne vs. M.W.D. Agosinno (supra), S.N. Silva C.J.

clearly opined that the entitlement to a grant accrues to a permit holder

who duly satisfies all conditions of the permit and making payment of

all sums due. Such permit holder will then be issued with a grant in

terms of Section 19(4). In such circumstances, the nomination of a

successor made under the permit becomes converted to a nomination

under the grant. As I see, this principle stands to reason and is in

consonance with the definition of the word owner as considered by

Justice J. A. N. De Silva in Piyasena vs. Wijesinghe. Issuing of a grant

under Section 19(4) is necessarily preceded by the due satisfaction of

the conditions of a permit. Thus, it is only such a permit holder who will

be entitled to a grant under Section 19(4). Therefore, a nomination made

during the pendency of the permit, unless cancelled or revoked, would

remain valid and effectual notwithstanding the subsequent issuance of

a grant. This is the principle determined in Piyasena vs. Wijesinghe

and M.W.D. Dayaratne vs. M.W.D. Agosinno (supra).

Conclusion.

25. In the above circumstances, I hold that the nomination by endorsement

of the petitioner, reflected in the permit and the land ledger was valid

and effectual at the point of the demise of Podimanike. The petitioner

has made several attempts to have his nomination asserted which had

not been considered by the respondents. The Divisional Secretary has

then named the 4th respondent K. M. Harischandra as the successor,

WRT/0171/20

Page 13 of 13

which is now registered as A6. It was incumbent upon the Divisional

Secretary to have considered the three nominations and to have

determined the relevant successor.

26. Accordingly, the entry appearing in the land register marked A6 is

hereby quashed by way of certiorari and the 1st, 2nd, and/or 3rd

respondents are directed to duly consider the three nominations and to

determine the lawful successor according to law. Writ of certiorari to that

extent, as prayed for by paragraph (d) is granted.

Application is allowed to that extent. However, I make no order as to

costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
