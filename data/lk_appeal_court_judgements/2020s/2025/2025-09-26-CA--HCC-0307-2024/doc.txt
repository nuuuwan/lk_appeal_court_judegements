Judgment

Introduction

1. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “Appellant”) was indicted before

the High Court of Puttlam for following charges;

(a) On or about 28-02-2016, within the jurisdiction of this Court, at Mundel, the

Appellant by having sexual intercourse with a girl below sixteen years of age, namely

Rajapakshe Pathiranalage Gimhani Hansika, who was the daughter of his wife by

another father and who stands towards him in some enumerated degrees of

relationship as described in section 364A (1), committed the offence of rape on said

Rajapakshe Pathiranalage Gimhani Hansika which is an offence punishable under

section 364 (3) of the Penal Code as amended by the Act No. 22 of 1995

(b) At the time and the place mentioned in the above charge and at the same transaction,

the Appellant, by using the Appellant’s genitals on any orifice or part of the body of a

girl below 16 years namely, Rajapakshe Pathiranalage Gimhani Hansika committed

the offence of grave sexual abuse, which is an offence punishable under section 365B

(2)(b) of the Penal Code as amended by the Act No. 22 of 1996, 29 of 1998 and 16 of

2006.

(c) During the period of 29-02-2016 to 18-03-2016, within the jurisdiction of this Court,

at Mundel, the Appellant by having sexual intercourse with a girl below sixteen years

of age, namely Rajapakshe Pathiranalage Gimhani Hansika, who was the daughter of

his wife by another father and who stands towards him in some enumerated degrees of

relationship as described in section 364A (1), committed the offence of rape on aid

Rajapakshe Pathiranalage Gimhani Hansika which is an offence punishable under

section 364 (3) of the Penal Code as amended by the Act No. 22 of 1995

2. When the charges were read out to the Appellant, he pleaded not guilty of the charges.

Accordingly, the matter had been taken up for trial before the High Court Judge without a

jury. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge convicted the Appellant

for the 3rd charge, after reducing it to a lesser offence under section 365B (2) (b) of the

CA/HCC/0307/2024

3 | P a g e

Penal Code (as amended) and imposed a sentence of 14 years rigorous imprisonment.

Additionally, the Appellant was also ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 20,000/- and serve a

sentence of three months’ imprisonment in the event of default. Also, he was ordered to

pay the victim a sum of Rs. 200,000/- as compensation and a default sentence of one-year

simple imprisonment.

3. Being aggrieved by the Judgment and the Sentencing Order dated 27-11-2024, the

Appellant has preferred the instant Appeal.

Brief Facts of the Case

4. As per the testimony of PW1, she had been living in her mother’s house with her mother,

step-father and her sister at the time this incident of sexual abuse took place. While PW1

was sleeping in her room, her mother’s second husband, the Appellant in the present case,

had come to her room and touched her breasts. Thereafter, he has undressed her and

committed some act on her female organ using his penis. However, no evidence was

forthcoming from PW1 to suggest that that the vaginal penetration had taken place.

5. According to PW1, this has happened only once when her mother and the sister had been

away from home. After this incident she had gone and informed her mother about the

same. However, the mother did not believed her story. PW1 had stopped going to school

after this incident and the class teacher had come to her place looking for her. Then, after

about two weeks, she had informed her class teacher about this incident when she went to

the school once again. Thereafter, upon being informed by the class teacher of PW1, the

Principal has informed the police about the said incident. Subsequently, the police had

visited the school, after which PW1 was taken to police, where she gave a statement on

the sexual abuse that was committed on her.

Analysis

6. Although several grounds of appeal were set out in the Petition of Appeal, at the hearing

the learned Counsel for the appellant informed the Court that the appellant intended to

contest only the sentence. Accordingly, the sole question for determination in this appeal

is whether the sentence imposed on the appellant by the learned High Court Judge of

Puttalam is excessive in the circumstances of the case.

CA/HCC/0307/2024

4 | P a g e

7. The main contention of the Counsel for the Appellant is that it is inappropriate to apply

the rationale of Withanapathiranalage Dickson Nihal Appuhamy v Attorney General

HCC/0289/2019 (Decided on 17-12-2021) to the instant case as the facts and the

circumstances of the present case are different to that of Dickson Nihal Appuhamy. It

was submitted that, in the case of Dickson Nihal Appuhamy the victim was unconscious

at the time the Accused committed the offence due to an attack by the accused himself,

while in the present case, the prosecutrix was conscious during the incident and was quite

capable of providing an accurate account of the incident that took place. Therefore, it was

submitted that applying the rationale of Dickson Nihal Appuhamy as it is, without any

discrimination, was prejudicial to the Appellant in the present case.

8. Before proceeding to consider whether it is correct to adopt the reasoning in Dickson

Nihal Appuhamy to the present case, it is necessary first to examine the circumstances

which persuaded the learned High Court Judge to apply the ratio decidendi of that

decision

9. Upon the conclusion of the trial, and after carefully analyzing the evidence placed before

her, the learned High Court Judge has arrived at the conclusion that the Appellant cannot

be convicted for the first count of rape as no evidence was forthcoming from PW1 to

establish that the alleged incident of rape had taken place during the time period

mentioned in the indictment (i.e. on or about 28-02-2016). The second charge relates to

an act of anal sex committed on PW1 by the Appellant. However, at the trial before the

High Court, PW1 has not mentioned anything regarding the alleged act of anal sex

committed on her by the Appellant. Since the first and the second charges remain

unproved, the learned High Court Judge has proceeded to consider whether the

Prosecution has proved the ingredients of third count of rape beyond reasonable doubt.

10. After considering the evidence placed before her, the learned High Court Judge has noted

that, while other ingredients such as the time, place, the fact that PW1 was a girl below 16

years of age and her relationship to the Appellant have been proved, no evidence was

forthcoming from PW1 to establish that the Appellant has had sexual intercourse with

PW1. In the aforesaid circumstances, the learned High Court Judge has considered

whether this is an appropriate case to apply the legal principles encapsulated in section

177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act (hereinafter referred to as “CCPA”) to convict

the Appellant for the offense of grave sexual abuse which is a lesser offence.

CA/HCC/0307/2024

5 | P a g e

11. Section 177 of the CCPA reads as follows;

If in the case mentioned in section 176 the accused is charged with one offence and it

appears in evidence that he committed a different offence for which he might have

been charged under the provisions of that section, he may be convicted of the offence

which he is shown to have committed although he was not charged with it.

12. When applying the provisions of section 177 to convict the Appellant for the lesser

offence of grave sexual abuse, the learned High Court Judge has heavily relied on the

case of Dickson Nihal Appuhamy. In Dickson Nihal Appuhamy, the accused was the

step father of the prosecutrix. She had been at home with the accused and the sister. The

accused had been consuming alcohol in the sitting room. After having a bath, she had

come to her room wearing a towel, to change. Then the accused had come and held her by

the hand and covered her mouth. Within the scuffle, her head struck on the wall or the

cupboard, where she fell unconscious. When she regained consciousness, she has felt

dizzy and also pain in the genital area. Thereafter, she had seen the accused sleeping on

the floor near the cot where her sister was. The prosecutrix in her evidence has never

stated that the accused inserted the penis into her vagina. All what she said was she fell

unconscious, and when she regained consciousness her vaginal area was painful.

Furthermore, in her evidence she has also denied having any sexual penetration by

anyone else other than the alleged incident that happened with the accused.

13. While the prosecutrix never mentioned in direct terms that the accused inserted his penis

into her vagina, the Medical Officer who testified in Court has stated that there was

evidence of vaginal penetration. However, there was no evidence whatsoever to establish

that it was penile penetration. Therefore, in that case the Court of Appeal has found that

the prosecution has failed to prove the charge of rape and that the learned High Court

Judge has erred when she convicted the accused for rape. Accordingly, the conviction for

rape against the accused was set aside by the Court of Appeal. However, Priyantha

Fernando J, applying the legal provisions of section 177 convicted the accused for the

grave sexual abuse committed on the prosecutrix even though he was not charged for that

offence. He held that;

[…] However, insertion of any other part of the human body or an instrument to the

vagina will constitute the offence of Grave Sexual Abuse as defined in Section 365B of

the Penal Code. Hence, when the charges were framed there had been a clear doubt

CA/HCC/0307/2024

6 | P a g e

as to which offence was committed, Rape or Grave Sexual Abuse, as the PW1 was

unconscious when the penetration happened. Thus, in terms of Section 176 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act the prosecution was entitled to indict him either for

Rape and alternatively Grave Sexual Abuse or for one of the offences. As it was

doubtful as to which of those offences the facts which can be proved will constitute,

the succeeding Section 177 provides for convicting for the offence which the appellant

is shown to have committed although he was not charged with it. It is also pertinent to

note that Rape and Grave Sexual Abuse come under the same class of sexual offences

and also defined in the same chapter of offences affecting the human body, Chapter

XVI of the Penal Code. As there was a doubt as to which of the offences was

committed due to the nature of the act, the Honourable Attorney General could have

indicted the appellant with a charge of Grave Sexual Abuse as well, at least

alternatively. As the prosecution has proved all the elements to constitute Grave

Sexual Abuse as provided in Section 365B (1)(a) of the Penal Code beyond

reasonable doubt, the appellant can be found guilty and convicted for the same in

terms of Section 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, although he was not

charged with Grave Sexual Abuse.

14. Therefore, the underlying rationale in Dickson Nihal Appuhamy is that, when there is no

sufficient evidence to convict an accused under the charge that was originally presented

and read over to him, but the prosecution has already established the elements that

constitute a different offence that the accused appeared to have committed, the accused

may be convicted for that offence by applying the legal principles enunciated in section

177 of the CCPA even if he has not been charged with it.

15. Notably, the facts and circumstances of the present case are very similar to Dickson Nihal

Appuhamy. In the present case, the prosecutrix was also sexually abused by her

stepfather. Most importantly, the prosecutrix never stated in clear and unambiguous terms

that the Appellant inserted his penis into her vagina. She merely stated that the Appellant

committed some act on her female organ using his penis, a claim that remains

unchallenged. The relevant portion of her evidence is produced below:

(Vide pg. 81-82)

16. In the aforesaid circumstances, the Counsel for the Appellant submitted that it is not

justifiable to impose a heavy jail term on the Appellant when PW1 submits a testimony

before the Court in a very vague manner, especially taken into consideration the fact that

PW1 is 23 old at the time of testifying before the High Court and the unavailability of

proper cross examination of PW1.

17. It is true that the only evidence that is forthcoming from PW1 is that the Appellant

committed some act on her female organ using his penis. PW1, despite being an adult

who has already been married, has never stated that the Appellant inserted his penis into

her vagina. However, it is important to note that, at the trial, no contradictions or

omissions have been marked by the Appellant’s Counsel. Even though PW1 has been

cross examined by the Counsel for the Appellant regarding the previous instances of

sexual abuse committed on her by her own father and the grandfather, it has never been

CA/HCC/0307/2024

8 | P a g e

suggested to her that it was only them who committed these acts of sexual abuse on her

and not the Appellant. PW1 has only been suggested that she is fabricating evidence to

falsely frame the Appellant, to which, she has answered in the negative.

18. Moreover, even if the Appellant has made a statement from the dock denying all the

allegations against him and stating that she has made similar kind of allegations against

her father and the grandfather, such mere denial does not suffice to create a reasonable

doubt on the Prosecution’s case. In the aforesaid circumstances, PW1’s evidence that the

Appellant committed some act on her female organ using his penis remains unchallenged.

19. In this context, it is imperative to consider the following observation made by Priyantha

Fernando J in Dickson Nihal Appuhamy regarding the actus reus/constituent elements of

the offence of grave sexual abuse;

[…]As I have mentioned before, the moment the penis, genitals or any other part of

the human body or instrument touches the vagina of a victim, the offence of grave

sexual abuse is completed [….].

20. In the present case, the Prosecution has established elements of grave sexual abuse even

though it has failed to establish the constituent elements of the offence, which the accused

was charged. Therefore, the learned High Court Judge was correct in applying the

reasoning of Dickson Nihal Appuhamy to the present case.

21. Furthermore, Counsel for the Appellant contended that it is not justifiable to rely solely

on the convicting rationale in Dickson Nihal Appuhamy when mitigatory factors were

also present in that case, which the Court of Appeal took into consideration in reducing

the sentence imposed by the High Court. It was further submitted that the mitigatory

grounds considered in that case were similar to those advanced by the defense in their

submissions in mitigation before the High Court.

22. However, the learned High Court Judge, even after considering those mitigatory factors

has still imposed a heavy jail term on the Appellant, i.e. 14 years of rigorous

imprisonment.

23. In the case before the High Court, it was submitted that the Appellant is 46 years old,

married, and has two children; that his wife is unwell and unable to earn a living; and

that, therefore, the Appellant is the sole breadwinner upon whom the entire family is

CA/HCC/0307/2024

9 | P a g e

financially dependent. Additionally, Counsel for the Appellant submitted that PW1 had

not been subjected to harsh cross-examination by the defense, and that the absence of

such cross-examination should be considered a mitigatory factor in the present case.

24. Accordingly, the principal ground urged by the defense in mitigation is the hardship

likely to befall the Appellant’s family consequent to his incarceration.

25. In deciding whether the mitigatory grounds advanced by the Appellant warrant a

reduction of sentence, this Court must not lose sight of the aggravating circumstances

surrounding the case, nor of the legislative intent in prescribing severe custodial sentences

for sexual offences.

26. Sri Lankan Courts, in a long line of judicial authorities have held that cases involving

sexual offences, especially where the victims are children, have to be severely dealt with

so as to create deterrence on the society.

27. In Attorney General v Hewa Walimunige Gunasena CA/PHC/110/2012 (Decided on

12-02-2014) it was held by Sunil Rajapakshe J that;

After analyzing the submissions made by the Petitioner and the accused Respondent I

am of the opinion that the facts relating to this case warrants that the accused should

be severely dealt with. Therefore a sentence of two years rigorous imprisonment

suspended for ten years on the accused for a grave child abuse is a very lenient

sentence considering the beastiliness of the crime. When an offence of child abuse is

proved victims of tender age and innocent behavior the sentence of imprisonment

should be imposed severely. Further I hold two years R.I suspended for tend years is

not adequate for the purpose of preventing the commission of further offences by the

accused. Cases of indecent touching, threats by an older man on a small girl seem to

attract custodial sentence.

28. Furthermore, in State of Andra Pradesh v. Bodem Sundara Rao, (1995) 6 SCC 230, AIR

1996 SC 530 the Indian Supreme Court while dealing with a case of reduction of sentence

from 10 years rigorous imprisonment to 4 years rigorous imprisonment by the High Court

in the case of rape of a girl aged between 13 and 14 years, observed:

CA/HCC/0307/2024

10 | P a g e

In recent years, we have noticed that crimes against woman are on the rise. These

crimes are an affront to the human dignity of the society. Imposition of grossly

inadequate sentence and particularly against the mandate of the Legislature not only

is an injustice to the victim of the crime in particular and the society as a whole in

general but also at times encourages a criminal. The Courts have an obligation while

awarding punishment to impose appropriate punishment so as to respond to the

society's cry for justice against such criminals. Public abhorrence of the crime needs

a reflection through the Courts verdict in the measure of punishment. The Courts must

not only keep in view the right of the criminal but also the rights of the victim of crime

and the society at large while considering imposition of the appropriate punishment.

The heinous crime of committing rape on a helpless 13/14 year old girl shakes our

judicial conciseness. The offence was inhumane.

29. The Courts are therefore, expected to deal with cases of sexual offenses committed

against women with utmost sensitivity. Such cases need to be dealt with sternly and

severely. Dealing with the offence of rape and its traumatic effect on a rape victim, it was

held in State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh 1996 AIR 1393, 1996 SCC (2) 384 that;

Of late, crime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase. It is

an irony that while we are celebrating woman's right in all spheres, we show little or

no concern for her honour. It is a sad reflection on the attitude of indifference of the

society towards the violation of human dignity of the victims of sex crimes. We must

remember that a rapist not only violates the victim's privacy and personal integrity,

but inevitably causes serious psychological as well as physical harm in the process.

Rape is not merely a physical assault- it is often destructive of the whole personality

of the victim. A murderer destroys the physical body of his victim, a rapist degrades

the very soul of the helpless female. The Courts, therefore, shoulder a greater

responsibility while trying an accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such

cases with utmost sensitivity

30. In the present case, when PW1 faced this unfortunate incident, she was a girl of 14 years

of age. According to PW1’s evidence she had been previously subjected to sexual abuse

by her own father and the grandfather on numerous occasions. Since she was sexually

abused by her father, PW1 had left her father’s house and gone to stay at her mother’s

place as she could not live with her father anymore. At the time, her mother had been

CA/HCC/0307/2024

11 | P a g e

living with the Appellant and it was while PW1 was at the Appellant’s place that this

heinous crime was committed by the Appellant to satisfy his lustful desires.

31. This is a story involving an incestuous stepfather who took advantage of his relationship

with PW1 to satisfy his lustful desires. Needless to say, when PW1 returned to stay with

her mother after the alleged incidents of sexual abuse by her father and grandfather, she

must have already been traumatized and in a very vulnerable position. She expected her

mother's home to be a safe haven.

32. It is also pertinent to note that the Appellant was 40 years old at the time. Instead of

affording PW1 the necessary protection and care expected of a responsible adult, he

exploited her helplessness and vulnerability to satisfy his own desires, conduct that

cannot be condoned under any circumstances. Furthermore, following the incident, PW1

informed her mother of what had transpired; however, the mother did not believe her

account, which may have driven PW1 into an even more vulnerable and helpless

situation.

33. In Archbold: Sentencing Guidelines (2019), Thomson Reuters, on page 274, under the

heading of applicability of guidelines on sexual offences, it is stated that;

“Starting points define the position within a category range from which to start

calculating the provisional sentence.

……… Once the starting point is established, the court should consider further

aggravating and mitigating factors and previous convictions so as to adjust the

sentence within the range. Starting points and ranges apply to all offenders, whether

they have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trial.”

34. Having regard to the aggravating circumstances set out above, the mitigatory grounds

advanced by the defence do not persuade this Court to interfere with the sentence

imposed by the learned High Court Judge. To elaborate, the aggravating factors clearly

outweigh the mitigating factors, and accordingly, the sentence imposed on the Appellant

by the learned High Court Judge does not warrant any reduction.

35. However, it is important to note that the Appellant has been serving his sentence since 27-

11-2024. Therefore, approximately, the Appellant has spent 10 months in remand custody

by now.

CA/HCC/0307/2024

12 | P a g e

36. At this juncture, it is imperative to consider the legal provisions of section 333(5) of the

CCPA;

Provided that, the Court of Appeal may, in appropriate cases, order that the time

spent by an appellant in custody pending the determination of his appeal and any time

spent in custody prior to the conviction, such time not having been considered as part

of his sentence passed at the time of his conviction by the court of first instance, be

considered as part of his sentence ordered at the conclusion of his appeal.

37. Accordingly, Section 333(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act (CCPA) empowers

the Court of Appeal to treat the period an accused person has spent in custody prior to

conviction as part of the sentence ultimately imposed.

38. Having considered the period the Appellant has spent in remand, I am of the view that it

is appropriate to deduct the ten months spent in custody until the determination of this

appeal from the sentence imposed on the Appellant.

39. Accordingly, I direct that the period of ten months which the Appellant has already spent

in remand custody be deducted from the sentence imposed. Furthermore, I order that the

Appellant’s term of imprisonment shall operate from the date of conviction, namely

27.11.2024. The order as to fine, compensation, and the default sentence shall remain

unaltered. Subject to the aforesaid variation, this appeal is hereby partially allowed.
