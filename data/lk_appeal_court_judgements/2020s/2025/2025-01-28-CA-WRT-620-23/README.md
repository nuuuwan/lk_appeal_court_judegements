The Petitioner instituted this application by petition dated 17.10.2023 seeking inter alia

a writ of Certiorari to quash the Resolution marked P23A passed by the Board of Directors

of the Respondent Bank to sell the property containing Eminence Luxury Banquet Hall

by auction and to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent Bank to refuse the granting of

a moratorium to the Petitioners under the circular marked P25.

Page 4 of 14

The facts of this case are as follows:

According to the Petitioners, they are entrepreneurs and had been carrying on a business

of managing Banquet Halls since 2003 and initiated the said business by purchasing

Renuka Banquet Hall at Ganemulla via a leasing facility for a period of 20 years since

01.01.2003.

The Petitioners state that they purchased the land in Kirillawala facing the Kandy Road

and constructed a building comprising 4 stories and operated a banquet hall in the said

building by the name of Senara White Palace under the incorporated legal entity Senara

White Palace (Pvt.) Ltd since 16.09.2011. The Petitioners state that the Petitioners

engaged in another business venture to construct a state-of-the-art banquet Hall in

Thihariya under the name of Eminence Luxury banquet Hall.

The Petitioners further state that they purchased three adjoining plots of land to

construct the said Banquet Hall in Thihariya and an amalgamated plan was drawn for

the total land parcel consisting of one acre three roods and thirty-eight perches (A:1 R:3

P:38) owned by the Petitioners on 05.04.2016 bearing No. 6269 by the licensed surveyor

S.R.P. Pathiraja marked P2. The Petitioner avers that the plan marked P2 was purchased

by the Petitioners as follows:

A. On 05.04.2013, the Petitioners purchased the plot of land referred to as land parcel

A, depicted in the plan bearing No. 5713 drawn by S.R.P. Pathiraja Licensed

Page 5 of 14

Rosairo Weragoda Notary Public marked as P4A for a valuable consideration of

Rs. 30,000,000/-.

C. 0n 19.10.2015, the Petitioners purchased the plot of land referred to as land parcel

C, depicted in the plan bearing No. 12751 drawn by K.K.A.S. Padmini Licensed

Surveyor marked as P5B, by the deed bearing No. 4113 attested by G. Prasantha

Nilmini Perera Notary Public marked as P5A for a valuable consideration of Rs.

12,000,000/-.

The Petitioners further aver that the lands enumerated in deed marked P3A and P4A

purchased by the Petitioners with the financial assistance of the Respondent Bank

granted by way of mortgaging the respective lands and the land parcel C was purchased

by amalgamating several lands.

The Petitioners state that in accordance with the folio marked P6A, the land parcel A was

mortgaged to the Respondent Bank by deed bearing No. 10077 attested by P.N.

Ekanayake Notary Public on 05.04.2013 for an amount of Rs. 26,000,000/- and the limit

for the mortgage bond for the said land parcel was increased for an amount of Rs.

5,000,000/- by the Respondent Bank by the deed bearing No. 12009 attested by P.N.

Ekanayake Notary Public on 19.10.2015.

The Petitioners further state that in accordance with the folio marked P6B, the land

parcel B was mortgaged to the Respondent Bank by deed bearing No. 10534 attested by

P.N. Ekanayake Notary Public on 29.11.2013 for an amount of Rs. 30,000,000/- and the

limit for the mortgage bond for the said land parcel was increased for an amount of Rs.

The Petitioners state that the amalgamated land depicted in plan marked P2 was

mortgaged to the Respondent bank for an amount of Rs. 300,000,000/- by the mortgage

Page 6 of 14

bond bearing No. 12657 attested by P.N. Ekanayake Notary Public on 29.09.2016 which

was further mortgaged to the Respondent by a secondary mortgage bond bearing no.

12658 P.N. Ekanayake Notary Public on the same day.

As stated by the Petitioners, upon acquiring the land parcels A, B and C and securing the

finances, the constructions of Eminence Luxury Banquet Hall was started, since when

the Petitioners were able to settle all the interest payments on time with the income they

got from managing Renuka Banquet Hall and Senara White Palace from 2013 to 2019.

The Petitioners further state that the Petitioners obtained an amount of Rs. 312,400,000/-

under Term Loan Facility I, an amount of Rs. 82,000,000/- under Term Loan Facility II

and, an amount of Rs. 100,000,000/- under Term Loan Facility III.

The Petitioners state that however, under Term Loan Facility III which was granted upon

mortgaging of Senara White Palace, the Petitioners were only granted an amount of Rs.

82,700,000/- after deducting an amount of Rs. 12,300,000/- for an existing loan taken from

the Bank of Ceylon. The Petitioners further state that they repaid the interests on time

when the business was flourishing till 2019.

The Petitioners state that due to the Easter Sunday attacks in 2019, the industry of the

Petitioners was badly impacted and the Petitioners fell behind in the interest payments

made to the Respondent Bank. The Petitioners further state that they mortgaged the land

which was used as the car park of Senara White Palace to a third party and remitted a

sum of Rs. 52,500,000/- to the Respondent Bank amidst severe financial difficulties and

the said car park was later acquired by the said third party.

According to the Petitioners, due to Covid-19 pandemic, the Petitioners business further

deteriorated and since the events held at Senara White Palace after 2019 were

conducted at a loss, the Petitioners were not able to pay the interests to the bank.

Page 7 of 14

The Petitioners state that a show cause letter dated 19.10.2022 marked P13 was sent to

the Petitioners by the Senior Manager of the Ganemulla Branch of the Respondent Bank

inter alia seeking reasons for non-payment of the term loan facilities and indicating that

the balance amount payable by the Petitioners as Rs. 536,672,316.47/-.

In reply, the Petitioners sent a letter dated 22.10.2022 stating that the normal

functionality of the Petitioners business had been severely affected due to the pandemic

and economic crisis.

The Petitioners state that the Respondent bank delayed in issuing the Term Loan facility

III for the value of Rs. 100,000,000/- when the estimated cost for the completion of the

Eminence Luxury Banquet Hall was only Rs. 130,000,000/- and upon granting the

Respondent had only given Rs.82,700,000/- and out of the said granted amount Rs.

5,000,000/- is still being withheld by the Respondent. The Petitioners further state that

since the funds were being delayed, the Petitioners had to sell their personal vehicle and

a property. The Petitioners further aver that however, the Petitioners had sold all the

other properties except Senara White Palace which is the sole source of income for the

Petitioners.

As stated by the Petitioners, the construction of the Eminence Luxury Banquet Hall

which was approved by the Pradeshiya Sabha of Attanagalla was completed to a degree

of 90% according to the valuation report marked P17 and the constructed portion valued

to Rs. 1,404,275,000/-. The Petitioners state that in addition to the said valuation, the

Petitioners bought amenities worth over Rs. 10,000,000/-.

The Petitioners further state that, by letter dated 13.02.2023 marked P20, the Petitioner

was notified that the Board of Directors of the Respondent Bank has passed a resolution

to auction the Eminence Luxury Banquet Hall property to recover the outstanding

facilities. The Petitioners state that though they were verbally given a grace period until

Page 8 of 14

30.09.2023 to settle the outstanding amounts from the Respondent bank upon negotiating

a settlement plan with the Respondent Bank, by letter dated 18.07.2023 marked P23, the

Respondent bank notified the Petitioners that the property in which the Eminence

Luxury Banquet Hall is situated was published in the Gazette and newspapers purported

acting under Section 4 of the Recovery of Loans by Bank (Special Provisions) Act No.4 of

1990.

The Petitioners further state that, by letter dated 25.09.2023, the Petitioners were

notified that the property containing Eminence Luxury Banquet Hall will be sold at a

public auction on 23.10.2023 at 9.00 a.m.

Further, the Petitioners state that the Resolution marked P23A had appointed the 13th

Respondent to sell the land of the Petitioners at a public auction on the said date. As

averred by the Petitioners, the letter marked P24 inter alia states that the Petitioners are

not entitled to the moratorium granted by the Central Bank on 07.07.2022 as the

Petitioners had not come to an agreement with the Respondent on any settlement plan.

The Petitioners state that according to Circular No. 2 of 2022 dated 07.07.2022 marked

P25, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank had directed the licensed banks including

the Respondent to consider granting concessions on a case-by-case basis by clause 4.1 of

the said Circular.

The Petitioners state that the Respondent had not conducted a valuation of the property

pursuant to auctioning of the said property.

The main grievance of the Petitioners is that the Resolution passed by the Respondent

Bank to sell the property containing Eminence Luxury Banquet Hall by auction is

arbitrary and unreasonable on the basis that the said auction was called without

conducting a valuation for a period of more than three years of the said property and

without ascertaining the current market value.

Page 9 of 14

In this context, the Petitioners have invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court seeking

inter alia, writs of Certiorari to quash the resolution marked P23A and the decision of the

Respondent Bank to refuse the granting of a moratorium to the Petitioners under circular

marked P25.

On the other hand, the Respondents raised objections by Statement of Objections dated

27.11.2023, that the Petitioners were given ample opportunities to repay their dues.

We are mindful that in Section 10 of the said Act, there is a provision available to stay

the auction which reads as follows:

Section 10

(1) If the amount of the whole of the unpaid portion of the loan, together with

interest payable and of the moneys and costs, if any, recoverable by the Board

under section 13 is tendered to the Board at any time before the date fixed for the

sale, the property shall not be sold, and no further steps shall be taken in

pursuance of the resolution under section 4 for the sale of that property.

(2) If the amount of the instalment in respect of which default has been made, and

of the moneys and costs, if any, recoverable by the Board under section 13 is

tendered to the Board at any time before the date fixed for the sale, the Board may

in its discretion direct that the property shall not be sold and that no further steps

shall be taken in pursuance of the substitution under section 4 for the sale of that

property.

But the Petitioner has failed to take any steps to prevent the sale. There is no material to

be found to establish that the Petitioner has paid at least the unpaid installment up to

the time this action was filed. This section was referred by His Lordship Chitrasiri J in

DFCC Bank (PLC) v. Fathima Ruzana Fakurdeen and others., SC Appeal No. 133/2014,

decided on 24.03.2016,

Page 10 of 14

Sub section (1) above provides for the borrower to prevent the auction being held

provided he/she tenders to the Board unpaid portion of the loan together with

interest and the costs incurred thereto. Sub section (2) allows the borrower to pay

the installment in respect of which default has been made with the moneys and

costs recoverable by the Bank and then to request the Board to halt the auctioning

of the property mortgaged using its discretion referred to therein. Therefore, it is

clear that the borrower should have paid the unpaid installments if he/she has not

paid the entire unpaid amount, in order to move under Section 10 of the Act No.4

of 1990.

To see whether the Petitioner has attempted to the concession under the said circular,

Courts attention was drawn on Section 7 (1), 7(2) and 7 (3) of the said circular which was

marked as P25.

7 Transparency of the Concessions

7.1 Eligible Borrowers may request for the above concessions on or before 31 July

2022 in writing or through electronic means.

7.2 Licensed banks shall make the decision on whether to accept or decline the

request made by the borrower within one month of the receipt of the request and

duly inform the burrower of such decision.

7.3 In the case of a rejection of request, licensed banks shall inform the burrower

the reasons for such rejection and shall advise the burrower by and through the

same letter that there is an opportunity for the borrower to appeal against such

rejection to the Director, Financial Consumer Relations Department of the Central

Bank of Sri Lanka.

There is no indication that the Petitioner has applied for this concession which was

refused by the Bank. Even if it was refused, there is a provision available to him to appeal

Page 11 of 14

to Director Financial Consumer Relations Department. Generally, our Courts are

reluctant to issue Certiorari when there is an adequate alternate remedy.

We are mindful of the sentiments expressed by the Justices in the following judgements

with regard to the Recovery of Loans by Banks under the Recovery of Loans by Banks Act.

His Lordship Samayawardhena J (as he was then) in Bettans Group of Companies (Pvt)

Ltd v. Lankaputhra Development Bank and Others, CA/WRIT 230/2015, Decided on

10.07.2020 held that;

Before I part with this Judgment let me also add the following. The Petitioner

cannot invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court as of right. It is a discretionary

relief; an act of grace on the part of the Court. The fact that the loan was obtained

and the Petitioner is in default is undisputed. By this application, filed more than

five years ago, the Petitioner has prevented the Bank from recovering its dues

through parate execution-a quicker and faster procedure recognised by the law.

Banks are not charitable institutions; they are the cornerstones of economies. It

should be understood that similar to the Petitioner being engaged in a business,

granting loans with the expectation of timely repayment is a major part of the

ordinary course of business of a Bank. If a Bank is prevented from taking such

measures as it is entitled in law to take to protect its interests, the economy of the

country would suffer. The Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act was

passed to assist Banks to fast-track the procedure of debt recovery. There is no

place for high-flown technical objections under this Act.

Amaradasa Liyanage v. Sampath Bank PLC, SC Appeal No:126/2012, Decided on

04.04.2014, His Lordship Tilakawardane,J held that;

The ambit and purpose of the Recovery of Loans by Banks Act is, in essence, to

recover monies due to the Bank while ensuring that the Bank does not enjoy an

Page 12 of 14

unjust enrichment. The provisions of the Act, by allowing parate execution, is to

facilitate the process of collecting monies due, without lengthy court proceedings,

and to do so in a fair and reasonable manner. This objective should therefore not

be hindered by minor procedural irregularities such as the absence of the

signatures of all Board members on the Certificate of Sale, for such minor

irregularities cannot have much impact on the rights of the borrower.

Minor procedural irregularities cannot, further, be grounds upon which actions

may be instituted for such actions would only amount to the abuse of the process

of Court which must not be allowed. In the present case, monies due remained

unpaid for a total of four years prior to the auction taking place and to challenge

the sale of property on the basis of a minor irregularity in documentation will

undoubtedly remain unsuccessful.

The above judgment was referred by His Lordship Aluwihare J in Upul Chaminda Perera

Kumarasinghe and Another v. Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC, SC Appeal No.

74/2021, Decided on 11.10.2023, held;

The plaintiffs cannot seek the intervention of the court to prevent the Defendant

Bank from lawfully exercising their rights in terms of a valid contract, without

making a case for irreparable and irremediable damage. Courts cannot and should

not be treated as the refuge of all defaulting creditors.

In Zubair v. Bank of Ceylon, 2000 (2) SLR 187 at page 188, Udalagama., J held that;

Before parting with this order it would also be appropriate to mention that in

Debt Recovery matters it would not be correct for courts to hold against the

intention of the Legislature on technicalities.

We are mindful that since the Petitioner has failed to pay the loan facilities which he

obtained in 2015 as stated by the Respondents, bank has given ample facilities by

Page 13 of 14

rescheduling the said loan. It is clear that the conduct of the Petitioner amounts to a

habitual defaulter that is to say that his conduct does not honor his obligation. Under

such circumstances, the Court will not grant any relief even if he is entitled under the

said circular.

Jayaweera v. Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and Another, 1996 (2)

SLR 70 at page 73, His Lordship Jayasuriya, J held that;

I hold that the Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a

writ of certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right

or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the court has a

discretion to deny him relief having regard to his conduct; delay, laches, waiver,

submission to jurisdiction are all valid impediments which stand against the grant

of relief.

The Petitioner did not satisfy this Court that by passing of the resolution, the Respondent

bank has acted contrary to the circular marked as P25 or has ignored the direction given

by the Monetary Board.

As stated by His Lordship Justice Grero in Desmond Perera and Others v. Karunarathne,

Commissioner of National Housing and Others, (1994) 3 SLR page 316, at pages 329 and

330:

As pointed out by the learned President's Counsel for the 3rd respondent, Lord

Diplock in the case of CCSV v. Minister for the Civil Service (1984) UKHL 9, clearly

classified under three heads the grounds on which administrative action could be

subject to control by judicial review. They are:

(i) Illegality;

Page 14 of 14

(ii) Irrationality; and

(iii) Procedural impropriety.

By 'Illegality' as a ground for judicial review, I mean that the decision-maker must

understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must

give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a justiciable question to be

decided, in the event of dispute, by those persons, by judges by whom the judicial

power of the state is exercisable.

In the instant case, the Petitioner has failed to satisfy the above said grounds. Therefore,

for the above said reasons I dismiss the application of the Petitioner with Costs of Rs.

50,000/-.
