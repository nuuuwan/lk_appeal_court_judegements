JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The 2nd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 12th, and 13th Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as

'the Accused') and the 1st and 10th Accused who were found guilty and dead along

with the 3rd, 6th (dead), 7th, 8th, 14th, and 15th Accused who were acquitted after

trial and 11th Accused (who is dead) had been indicted before the High Court of

Matara on thirteen counts inter alia, committing the murder of five persons

namely, Lasantha Thenabadu, M.M. Jagath Chaminda Kumara, Ranjith

Hendavitharana, P. Supun Chandra Kumara and Nihal Abeydeera and attempted

murder of one M.M. Ruwan Sumith Kumara whilst being members of an unlawful

assembly with the common object to cause hurt to the aforesaid deceased on or

about 14.11.2000 offences punishable under Sections 140, 146 read together with

296 read with 300 and Section 32 of the Penal Code as amended.

During the trial, the following witnesses gave evidence on behalf of the

Prosecution.

1. PW1 Harry Jayalath Hendavitharana

2. PW2 M.Y.M. Pradeep Ruwan Kumara

3. PW14 Dr. K.I. Padmatileke (AJMO Matara)

4. PW15 K.V.D.B. Jagath Gunawardena, Inspector of Police

5. PW16 M.G. Dharmadasa, Sub Inspector of Police

Page 5 of 20

6. PW19 Dr. S.M. Subasinghe

7. N.R. Kodagoda Officiating Registrar

When the trial commenced, PW3 and PW6 were abroad and several witnesses

were called to establish that the said two witnesses could not be called in evidence.

The 9th and 12th Accused gave evidence under oath and the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 13th

Accused made dock statements. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High

Court Judge found the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 12th, and 13th Accused guilty of 1st to 7th

counts leveled against them and imposed the following sentences;

i. Fine of Rs. 10,000 (each) for the first charge

ii. Two years rigorous imprisonment and additional fine of Rs.

10,000 (each) and an additional imprisonment of 6 months in

default

iii. Compensation of Rs. 250,000 to be paid to PW2 by the Accused

in equal portions and an additional term of 6 months

imprisonment in default.

iv. Death penalty

Further, the 3rd, 7th, 8th, 14th and 15th Accused were acquitted. It should be noted

that there is no indication with regard to whether the 11th Accused was convicted

or acquitted.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction, the Accused appealed to this Court.

Following are the grounds of appeal as pleaded by the Accused.

1. The Prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.

Page 6 of 20

2. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the improbability and

infirmities of narration of the incident by the eye witnesses.

3. The Learned High Court Judge has erred in deciding that the van alleged

to have been used by the Accused to travel to the scene was owned by the

2nd Accused.

4. The Prosecution has failed to establish the formation of an unlawful

assembly and the Learned High Court Judge has erred in deciding that the

Accused were properly identified by the witnesses.

5. The Learned High Court Judge has disregarded the credibility of the

prosecution witnesses and has erred in failing to consider the contradictions

adequately of the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses.

6. The Learned High Court Judge has erred in law permitting the adoption of

the non-summary dispositions of PW3 and PW6 notwithstanding the non-

compliance with provisions contained in Section 33 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

7. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to properly evaluate the dock

statements of the Accused.

8. The Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself in law and in fact in

convicting the Accused having acquitted the co-Accused on the same weight

of evidence elicited by the prosecution violating the dicta of indivisibility of

credibility of witnesses.

The main argument put forward by the Accused was that the Prosecution had

failed to prove that all the Accused shared a common object when the alleged

offences were committed.

Page 7 of 20

Before delving into the legal questions, it is pertinent to consider the facts which

were revealed at the trial.

According to PW1, on the day in question, he along with the other witnesses and

the deceased were traveling in van No. 57-5845 which was driven by one of the

deceased namely Lasantha Thenabadu to appear for a case in the Magistrate

Court of Matara where he was a suspect of the murder of 1st Accuseds brother.

According to him, a van coming from the opposite direction blocked their van.

Subsequently, 3 people including the 1st Accused who is deceased now and two

unknown persons got down from that van and started shooting. According to him,

the 9th Accused namely Namal came in a different vehicle and got down. When we

analyse this evidence, we note that in the examination in chief, he had not

mentioned the 2nd Accused but he was referring that the van belonged to the 2nd

Accused. But, later in re-examination, he has mentioned the 2nd Accuseds name.

Further, we note that he has not referred to any other Accused except these names.

We also observe that the 2nd Accused was known to him. But he did not mention

his name during the examination in chief.

According to PW2, he was seated in the front row of the van between the deceased

namely Lasantha Thenabadu and Ranjith Hendavitharana. He further stated that

the 4th Accused got down from the van and first shot Ranijth, then Lasantha, and

then him. With the gunshot, he became unconscious and when he regained

consciousness, he saw that some others in the van were also shot. It should be

noted that when he was admitted to the hospital, he told the Judicial Medical

Officer that some unknown people had come and shot them.

Page 8 of 20

PW3, whose evidence was led under Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance, has

stated in the non-summary inquiry that, she was seated in the 3rd row of the van

and saw the 1st Accused approached the van and started shooting towards the van.

She stated that she also saw the 9th Accused namely Namal in the scene.

Thereafter, she has seen some other unknown people with them. She further

stated that she also saw the 5th, 10th, 12th, and 13th Accused at the crime scene. We

note that she had not stated in her evidence that the person who was seated behind

her was dead.

However, PW6 tells a different story who was a bystander. According to her, a van

stopped near Deepa Niwasa and the 1st Accused got down from the vehicle and

threatened to kill her. Thereafter, she hid herself near the wadiya with a child and

saw the incident from there. According to her, the 1st Accused had a gun and saw

3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 10th, 12th, and 13th Accused were also armed and they were shooting

at the van. Further, according to her, the 14th Accused drove the vehicle in which

all the Accused came. She observed that there were about 30 people and among

them, she identified only 15 people. We are mindful that the Police had only

recovered two types of cartridges from the scene.

According to PW15, when he arrived at the crime scene, he recovered 19 T-56 shell

casings and a red 12-boro shell. If PW6s evidence is to be believed that all fired at

the van, the Police should have collected more and different cartridges from the

place of the crime.

Now we analyse each piece of evidence separately, to see whether they are

consistent.

Page 9 of 20

PW1 has stated in the examination in chief that he saw the 1st Accused and two

others. In cross-examination, he stated that he saw the 9th Accused carrying a gun.

He further stated that the van belonged to the 2nd Accused. At the re-examination,

he mentioned the 2nd Accuseds name. We are mindful that all the people involved

in this case were living in the same area and there was a case pending. The

question then is why PW1 has not identified the two people who come with the 1st

Accused. We hold that he is not consistent with his evidence. According to him,

only 3 people came and shot.

In contrast to him, PW2 who was seated in the front row of the van has stated that

the 4th Accused got down and shot the passengers in the van. He firmly stated that

he only saw the 4th Accused shooting during the whole time. But, when giving

evidence to the Judicial Medical Officer, he stated that an unknown person came

and shot.

We note that later PW2 had changed the story saying that he identified the 4th

Accused. We note that PW2 is not a credible witness as he had not mentioned the

4th Accused in the first instance. The delay in mentioning the 4th Accused is tainted

with the opportunity for fabrication.

According to PW3, she had identified that there were a few people shooting but

identified only the 1st Accused with a weapon and the 9th Accused. She thereafter

stated that she also saw the 5th 10th, 12th, and 13th Accused after the shooting from

the back. At the cross-examination, she admitted that less than 5 people came and

shot. However, we observe that she did not mention in evidence that the person

Page 10 of 20

who was seated behind her was dead. The question is whether she was actually

inside the van. There is a doubt created from her evidence.

When we consider PW6, she stated that the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 10th 12th, and 13th

Accused got down from the van and started to fire at the van. Further, she stated

that the 14th Accused drove the van in which the said Accused came. She also

stated that there were around 15 people in the van. During the cross-examination,

she stated that there were around 30 people at the scene. This contradicts the

evidence given by PW1, PW2 and PW3. If we were to believe the PW6s story, that

the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 10th 12th, and 13th Accused were armed, there should be

more cartridges from different weapons found at the crime scene. Therefore, it is

noticed that if the story of PW6 is to be believed, the evidence of PW1, PW2, and

PW3 become contradictory. Their evidence is inconsistent with the number of

people involved. This contradiction goes to the root of the case and it is sufficient

to create a reasonable doubt in the prosecutions case.

We are mindful that the prosecution has only indicted 15 accused and not

mentioned about unknown people. Although PW6 identified only several Accused,

she mentioned that more people were around the place of the incident. We are also

mindful that, the Learned High Court Judge had acquitted the 3rd, 7th, 8th, 14th,

and 15th Accused.

When we consider all three witnesses namely PW1, PW2, and PW3 who were

inside the van, especially PW1 and PW2, they materially contradict each other

inter se. PW2 was in the front seat, according to him, he had seen only the 4th

Accused firing at the van. On the other hand, PW1 and PW3 who were at the back

Page 11 of 20

of the van had seen the 1st Accused and two others. These material contradictions

in their witnesses make their evidence highly unreliable. Further, in evaluating

the testimonies of these witnesses as a whole, it is clear that they are inconsistent

per se. The end result would be that no court could rely on this evidence to convict

the Accused. When we consider the judgment, unfortunately, the Learned Trial

Judge had not given his consideration to any of these contradictions. We hold that

the Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider these vital contradictions which

create doubt and erroneously proceeded to treat these witnesses as truthful

witnesses. The credibility of the witnesses is shattered by their inconsistency per

se.

Our Courts have considered the contradictions to be vital. The impact of

contradictions is considered in the following judgment.

In State of Uttar Pradesh v. M.K. Anthony, by His Lordship D. A. Desai J, reported

in Supreme Court Journal 1984 (2) page 498,

While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be

whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring

of truth. Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the

court to scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the

deficiencies, draw-backs and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a

whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor

of the evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of

the evidence is shaken as to render it unworthy of belief.

Page 12 of 20

We are of the view that the above-said witnesses, especially PW1 and PW2 are not

consistent in their evidence. Therefore, they are not reliable with the matter at

hand. PW3, although she is consistent with PW1 and PW2, there is a doubt that

she was inside the van. PW2 was not consistent at all. Further, when we consider

the bullets recovered from the scene and the evidence of the other witnesses, there

is a doubt created whether PW6 was exaggerating the incident. The evidence of

PW6 about the involvement of around 30 people is inconsistent with the facts as

the officers have only recovered two types of cartridges. Therefore, I am of the

opinion that the Learned Trial Judge should have considered these contradictions

before reaching the conclusion that the Accused had committed the offence. We

are mindful that a criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

When we consider the entire evidence of all 4 witnesses, considering the

inconsistency and the exaggeration, it shows that they have deliberately

attempted to bring the persons who were not on the scene. The Court can come to

the conclusion, that affects the credibility and the testimonial trustworthiness of

the witnesses. Therefore, in the circumstances, the finding of the Learned Judge

is wrong.

Now, we consider whether the prosecution had proved that there was an unlawful

assembly. The following scholarly authorities and judicial decisions lay out the

elements of an unlawful assembly.

Dr. Sir Hari Singh Gours Penal Code of India, 11th Edition, Volume 4, at page

1296;

8. Mere presence in assembly not sufficient.

Page 13 of 20

All persons who convene or who take part in the proceedings of an unlawful

assembly are guilty of the offence of taking part in an unlawful assembly.

Persons present by accident or from curiosity alone without taking any part

in the proceedings are not guilty of that offence, even though those persons

possess the power of stopping the assembly and fail to exercise it. Mere

presence in an assembly does not make such a person a member of an

unlawful assembly unless it is shown that he had done something or

omitted to do something which would make him a member of an unlawful

assembly, or unless the case falls under Sec. 142, I.P.C. It would appear

that the place of occurrence is surrounded on all sides by the houses of

appellants. If members of the family of the appellants and other residents

of the village assembled, all such persons could not be condemned ipso facto

as being members of that unlawful assembly. It would be necessary,

therefore, for the prosecution to lead evidence pointing to the conclusion

that all the appellants had done or been committing some overt act in

prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly. Where the

evidence as recorded is in general terms to the effect that all these persons

and many more were the miscreants and were armed with deadly weapons,

like guns, spears, pharsas, axes, lathis, etc. this kind of omnibus evidence

has to be very closely scrutinized in order to eliminate all chances of false

or mistaken implication. Simply because certain members are present in a

crowd at the time of a riot by the certain members of their community, it

cannot be said that they also, who used no violence, were guilty of the riot.

Page 14 of 20

This passage was considered by His Lordship Weerasuriya J in Samy and Others v.

Attorney General, 2007 (2) SLR 216, at page 226, held that;

It is well settled law that mere presence of a person in an assembly does

not render him a member of an unlawful assembly, unless it is shown that

he has said or done something or omitted to do something which would

make him a member of such an unlawful assembly or where the case falls

under section 139 of the Penal Code. Dr. Gour in Penal Law of India

discusses the law in respect of unlawful assembly as follows: (VoLlI page

1296-11th Edition) "All persons who convene or who take part in the

proceeding of an unlawful assembly are guilty of the offence of taking part

in an unlawful assembly. Persons present by accident or from curiosity

alone without talking any part in the proceedings are not guilty of that

offence, even though those persons possess the power of stopping the

assembly and fail to exercise it.

I reproduce the following passage dealing with the same issue from Ratanlal and

Dhirajlal, The Law of Crimes, 9th Edition, Page 321:

2. 'Common object.-The essence of the offence is the common object of the

persons forming the assembly. Whether the object is in their minds when

they come together, or whether it occurs to them afterwards, is not material.

But it is necessary that the object should be common to the persons who

compose the assembly, that is, that they should all be aware of it and concur

in it. It seems also that there must be some present and immediate purpose

of carrying into effect the common object; and that a meeting for

deliberation only, and to arrange plans for future action is not an unlawful

assembly.

Prof. G.L. Peiris in Offences Under the Penal Code of Sri Lanka on page 36:

Page 15 of 20

There are three basic elements in the definition of an unlawful assembly

in our law. These relate to (a) the number persons constituting the

assembly; (b) the existence of a common object among the members of the

assembly; and (c) the nature of the common object.

The above principle was considered in the following judgments.

In Rex v. Dias, Ceylon Law Record Volume 17, page 16, at page 18, His Lordship Soertsz,

J held that:

The offence of being a member of an unlawful assembly is an offence that

can be laid against each of five or more persons who come together with any

of the objects enumerated in the Section of the Penal Code constituting the

offence and once there is evidence to show that there were five or more

people assembled with the objects referred to, an indictment can be

presented against any one of them on the footing that he was a member of

an unlawful assembly and that in that capacity he committed the offences

he is charged with. Surely, such an accused person cannot take advantage

of the fact that his associates were unidentified and contend that as he alone

was identified, it cannot be said that he was a member of an unlawful

assembly. It is purely a question of fact whether there was an unlawful

assembly or not, and again it is purely a question of fact who the units of

that unlawful assembly were.

In Police Sergeant Kulatunga v. Mudalihamy, 42 NLR 33, His Lordship Chief

Justice Howard held that:

Both charges involved the proof of an unlawful assembly. It had, therefore,

to be proved by the prosecution that there was an unlawful assembly with

Page 16 of 20

a common object as stated in the charges. So far as each individual accused

was concerned it had to be proved that he Was a member of the unlawful

assembly which he intentionally joined. Also that he knew of the common

object of the assembly.

In Andrayas v. The Queen, 67 NLR, 425 at page 430, His Lordship Justice T. S.

Fernando held that:

It was, in our opinion, necessary for the trial judge to have given an

adequate direction to the jury that mere membership of an unlawful

assembly did not render each member of that unlawful assembly criminally

liable for an offence committed by some other member thereof. It was not,

in our opinion, a correct direction of the jury that mere membership of an

unlawful assembly, without more, rendered each member of that unlawful

assembly criminally liable for an offence committed by some other thereof.

Such liability arose at law only when the existence of a certain other

element or elements specified in section 146 of the Penal Code had been

established.

In the recent case of Samy and others v. Attorney General (Supra), it was held

that;

Therefore the vital ingredient of the offence of being a member of an

unlawful assembly is the intention to join the assembly with a particular

common object. The onus of proving the ingredient lies on the prosecution.

Page 17 of 20

In light of the above authorities, the Prosecution should establish that the 2nd, 4th,

5th, 9th, 12th, and 13th Accused who were being convicted, were members of the

unlawful assembly and that they shared a common object to commit the murders

of the five persons as mentioned in the indictment and continued to remain in the

said unlawful assembly. Further, they have to establish that the Accused were not

merely present at the scene.

Although I have discredited the evidence of the Prosecution, it is pertinent to

mention at this stage which of the evidence placed before the Learned High Court

Judge directed him to come to the conclusion that the said Accused persons were

members of an unlawful assembly with the common object to murder the said

deceased. Our Courts expect that 5 or more persons come together with a common

object to commit an offence. Then they should have intentionally joined and when

joined they should know the common object of the assembly.

According to evidence of PW1 and PW2, they have mentioned only the

participation of 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 9th Accused. On the other hand, PW3 says that she

saw the 1st and 9th Accused who were firing at the van. She simply mentioned that

the 5th, 12th, and 13th Accused were behind the van, but she did not utter a word

about their participation. With these three witnesses, the magic number 5, the

unlawful assembly of 5 was not established. The reason is that the Prosecution

should prove that the members of the said assembly knew what offence they were

going to commit. Then only all the members could be punished under the vicarious

liability. Apart from these witnesses, PW6 has implicated the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th,

10th, 12th and 13th Accused were at the crime scene and that 14th Accused drove

Page 18 of 20

the van. We note that the Learned High Court Judge has acquitted the 14th

Accused on the basis that he only drove the vehicle. According to PW6, there were

more than 30 people at the scene and all were firing at the van. Only based on this

evidence, I have disbelieved PW6.

Without analysing the evidence, the Learned High Court Judge has formed the

opinion that the Accused were members of the unlawful assembly and acquitted

the 14th Accused as he was just a driver. But he transported all these Accused who

were armed.

I am of the view that there is no iota of evidence to establish that the 2nd, 4th,

5th,9th, 12 and 13th along with the deceased 1st Accused were members of the

unlawful assembly with the object to commit the murders indicated in the

indictment. We are also mindful that the said indictment did not speak about the

persons who were unknown to the Prosecution.

In this context, I reproduce a relevant excerpt on this particular point from the

judgment delivered by the Learned High Court Judge.

We hold that the Learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself about the

legal principles of unlawful assembly. We are mindful that all the Accused were

acquitted of the charges of common intention.

For the said reasons, we set aside the conviction and the sentence against the said

Accused imposed on 30.06.2022.

Appeal allowed.
