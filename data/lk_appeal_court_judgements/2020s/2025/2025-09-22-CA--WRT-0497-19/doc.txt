JUDGEMENT

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J.

Facts.

1. The petitioner is a son of the original grantee, Rajapakshe Mohottige

Emis Appuhamy, of the grant bearing No. ප ො/ප්‍ර/4386, dated

28.01.1983, issued under Section 19 (4) of the Land Development

Ordinance No. 19 of 1935 (hereinafter referred to as “LDO”). The said

grant was registered on 24.06.1986. A copy of the said grant is annexed

to this application marked P-1. This is in respect of 3 acres of high land.

2. The said Appuhamy died on 21.07.1986. Thereafter, the petitioner

made an application to the Divisional Secretary to nominate him as the

successor, as he was the eldest son. Upon considering this request, the

2nd respondent Divisional Secretary nominated the petitioner as the

successor by his letter dated 23.01.2002 (vide P-3). Correspondingly,

the petitioner was also named and registered as the owner of the said

land (vide P-4). However, subsequently, the petitioner has found out

that the registration of his succession had been cancelled and the 5th

respondent, his brother, had been named as the permit holder of this

land (vide para 2 of P-4). On inquiry, the 2nd respondent has, by letter

dated 04.10.2004, confirmed the cancellation (vide P-6).

3. The reasons adduced for this decision, as stated in P-6, are that the

registration of the grant issued to Appuhamy has been effected after the

death of the said Appuhamy, and as such, the succession of the

petitioner is void; that the original permit is now valid and operative,

and all action in respect of the said land will be based on the said

original permit; and that the grant bearing No. ප ො/ප්‍ර/4386 is not valid.

WRT-497-2019

Page 4 of 14

Upon receiving this intimation, the petitioner has made several

representations and requests to the respondents, but with no success.

Further, the petitioner also has ascertained that upon the cancellation

of his registration, the 5th respondent, Rajapakshe Mohottige Don

Piyasena, has been named as the successor to the original permit and

made a nomination in his favour.

4. The petitioner has also made a complaint to the Human Rights

Commission. The position taken up by the 1st respondent is that since

the original grantee, Appuhamy, was not alive when the letter by which

the issuing of the grant was conveyed to him, the said grant was

invalidated.

5. The petitioner has then instituted this application on 15.11.2019. Upon

the granting of Notice, this Court has endeavoured to facilitate some

form of settlement, and the respondents have inquired and a report has

been submitted, marked R-8, along with the objections of the

respondents. The petitioner has participated; however, the 5th

respondent has not. The sum total of this report is that the grant is

dated 28.01.1983 but registered on 24.06.1986. It is found that the said

grant is valid, as the original grantee died thereafter on 21.07.1986; to

that extent, the reason stated in P-6 has now been resiled and retracted

to that extent.

6. However, it is reported that as the 5th respondent was the nominee in

the original permit, the said nomination continued to be valid and

effective even upon the issue of the grant, and as such, the petitioner’s

nomination and succession effected on 06.03.2005 had been cancelled

and a nomination made in favour of the 5th respondent and registered

the same. Then, the 1st - 4th respondents concede in P-8 that if a

nominee fails to succeed within 6 months or does not enter into

possession, it is a failure of succession in terms of Section 68 of the

LDO. It is further reported that a request for succession had been made

by the 5th respondent on 04.08.2003. The 5th respondent had also

WRT-497-2019

Page 5 of 14

asserted that he had been in possession since his birth. However, the

said Report observes that the decision to register the 5th respondent as

the successor had been made purely on the said letter, without

independently ascertaining its correctness or veracity. In these

circumstances, the Commissioner General of Land has expressed the

view that the 5th respondent has failed to succeed within the stipulated

period as required by Section 68 of the LDO.

7. It is also relevant to note that as much as the 5th respondent has failed

and has not participated at the said inquiry held, he has also not

appeared before this Court, notwithstanding being issued with notice

on several occasions.

Validity of the grant.

8. The 3rd respondent, in his letter P-6, has acted on the premise that the

grant bearing No.ප ො/ප්‍ර/4386 was not valid. The registration of the

ownership was thus cancelled but the 3rd and 4th respondents have now,

in P-8, conceded and admitted that the said grant is valid. A grant is

issued by the President under and by virtue of the provisions of

Section19(4) read with Section 19 (6) of the LDO. Once it is so made out,

such grant will be valid until and unless it is cancelled or determined as

provided for by the provisions of the LDO. The cancellation of grants and

permits is provided for by Sections 104 - 118A, under Chapter VIII of the

LDO as amended by Act No. 11 of 2022. Section 104 was repealed and

substituted and new Sections 104A, 104B, 104C, and 104D were

inserted immediately after Section 104. These amended and added

sections provide for the mode and procedure to be followed for the

cancellation of permits and grants. As the purported inference of

cancellation of the grant was made before the amending Act No. 11 of

2022 came into operation, the pre-amended provisions will be

considered in deciding this application. The said Section is as follows:

“The President may make order cancelling the grant of a holding if he is satisfied that there has been a failure of succession thereto

WRT-497-2019

Page 6 of 14

either because there is no person lawfully entitled to succeed or because no person so entitled is willing to succeed.”

9. The power to cancel a grant is vested exclusively with the President and

no other. On the perusal of Section 104, as the law then was, there was

no specific requirement of holding any inquiry or granting an

opportunity to the grantee/owner to be heard. However, in view of the

rules of natural justice, it is implicit and incumbent upon the authority

to afford an opportunity to be heard prior to the cancellation of such

grant or holding. By the subsequent amendment by Act No. 11 of 2022,

the requirement of providing a notice to the owner of a holding of such

grant is expressly provided for by Section 104A. Thereafter, Sections

104B, 104C, and 104D provide in detail the requirements to be followed

in effecting a cancellation.

10. Accordingly, even under the pre-amended Section 104, as it prevailed

then, it is incumbent upon the relevant authority to afford an

opportunity which admittedly has not been provided in this instance.

Being named as a successor to a grant and registration confers upon

such person proprietary rights over such land. The denial or deprivation

of such right or entitlement seriously affects and prejudices such right

of such person. The petitioner has not been heard before making this

decision. In this context, it is more the reason that the petitioner ought

to have been heard prior to the purported decision amounting to

cancellation being made by the 1st - 4th respondents. Therefore, there is

a serious violation and a failure to comply with the rules of natural

justice prior to the cancellation of the grant. In Regina vs. Commission

for Racial Equality ex parte Hillingdon LBC [1982] A. C. 779, Lord

Diplock said,

“Where an Act of Parliament confers upon an administrative body functions which involve its making decisions which affect to their detriment the rights of other persons or curtail their liberty to do as they please, there is a presumption that Parliament intended that

WRT-497-2019

Page 7 of 14

the administrative body should act fairly towards those persons who will be affected by their decision”. 11. The petitioner annexed the proceedings and the judgement of the

Polonnaruwa District Court, Case No. 13932/L/10, as document P-23.

There is material that has transpired that the 5th respondent had acted

in connivance with a Commissioner of Lands, who had been

instrumental in effecting the purported cancellation. This allegation is

also made in P-24, a letter written to the respondents where it is alleged

that a predecessor of the respondents had colluded with the 5th

respondent. This, to some extent, explains the reason for the sudden

reversal and cancellation in the manner alleged. This allegation is stated

in detail in document P-15, where the petitioner has made this specific

allegation to the District Secretary of Polonnaruwa. According to which,

it is alleged that the 5th respondent Piyasena’s daughter, R. M. D.

Pushpa Priyadarshani, serves as an Assistant Commissioner of Lands

at the Polonnaruwa Divisional Secretariat, and her husband happens to

be the Additional Divisional Secretary of Thamankaduwa, and that it is

they who orchestrated and engineered the purported cancellation.

12. Secondly, as the plain meaning clearly puts it beyond doubt, the sole

power of cancellation is with the President, and the Divisional Secretary

could not have and did not have any legal authority to effect the

purported cancellation. Therefore, the power to cancel a grant, even as

the law that prevailed then, was not conferred on the Government Agent

or the Divisional Secretary.

The cancellation of the registration.

13. In this application, the 2nd respondent has purported to cancel the

registration of the petitioner as the succeeding owner of the said grant.

The legal effect of deciding on the successor and the registration of the

same is that such person succeeds to the permit or grant and will

acquire the status or attributes of a permit holder or the owner, as the

case may be. With such nomination of the successor and registration

WRT-497-2019

Page 8 of 14

thereof, such nominee acquires the status of the owner of the holding.

The said owner of the holding will be in respect of the land alienated on

the grant. The status thus amounts to that of a grantee. Upon such

acquisition and the conferring of such status, such person will have all

the attributes, benefits, entitlements, and protection qua owner. That

being so, a cancellation of such registration or the reversal of the process

of registering the successor of a grant, in fact and in law, will amount to

a cancellation of such grant. By virtue of the provisions of Section 104

of the LDO, as the law was, and as well as after the amendment made

by Act No. 11 of 2022, the statutory power to cancel a grant is conferred

exclusively upon the President and no other. Accordingly, such grant

cannot be cancelled or reversed by any process which results in the

cancellation except in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VIII of

the LDO, by the President. To that extent, the purported decision

intimated by P-6 to reverse the process and to invalidate and cancel the

registration in P-4 is contrary to law, ultra vires, and is a nullity. This

decision had been made without affording a hearing to the petitioner

and in violation of the rules of natural justice. The decision clearly affects

the proprietary rights and interests of the petitioner and causes great

prejudice, depriving him of the property rights held by him.

14. S. A. de Smith in ‘Judicial Review’ (4th Ed., at page 420) states that

“Recent practice clearly indicates that where the proceedings were a

nullity an award of Certiorari will not readily be denied.” This was so

reflected in the case of Dharmaratne vs. Samaraweera and others

2004 (1) SLR 57, where the Supreme Court overturned the dismissal of

the writ applications, which the Court of Appeal had based partially on

the ground of laches raised ex mero motu, finding that the Commission’s

proceedings and adverse findings against the appellants were in flagrant

violation of natural justice (the audi alteram partem rule) and its

recommendations for depriving civic rights and instituting criminal

proceedings were ultra vires the Commissions of Inquiry Act. The Court

held that:

WRT-497-2019

Page 9 of 14

“The adverse findings against the appellant were therefore reached in flagrant violation of the audi alteram partem rule, and must be quashed on that ground. The appellant also complains that the 1st respondent has acted ultra vires in terms of reference set out in the warrant and/or the provisions of the Commissions of Inquiry Act and therefore the findings and the recommendations of the Commissioner are void.”

15. Thus, the 1st respondent Divisional Secretary does not have any power

to cancel a grant in the guise of cancelling the registration of the

succession. Accordingly, I hold that the cancellation effected by the

subsequent registration, as depicted in P-4, the entry by which the

registration of the ownership of the petitioner is purported to have been

cancelled and entered by the Registrar on 30.09.2004, is null and void.

Further, I find that the consequential entry by which the 5th respondent

R. M. D. Piyasena, has been registered as the succeeding owner, entered

by the Registrar of Lands on 04.03.2005, is also without jurisdiction and

therefore ultra vires and void.

Failure to succeed as per Section 68.

16. The position now taken up by the 4th respondent in R-8 is that there

was a failure to succeed by the 5th respondent. It is thus admitted and

is common ground that the 5th respondent has not come forward and

sought to succeed within the stipulated 6 months of the demise of the

original owner. To that extent, the provisions of Section 68 will come into

operation, and it will thus amount to a failure of succession. Section 68

reads as follows:

“68. Failure of Succession

(1) The spouse of a deceased permit-holder, who at the time of his or her death was paying an annual instalment by virtue of the provisions of section 19*, or the spouse of an owner, fails to succeed to the land held by such permit-holder on the permit or to the holding of such owner, as the case may be-

(a) if such spouse refuses to succeed to that land or holding, or

WRT-497-2019

Page 10 of 14

(b) if such spouse does not enter into possession of that land or holding within a period of six months reckoned from the date of the death of such permit-holder or owner. (2) A nominated successor fails to succeed to the land held on a permit by a permit-holder who at the time of his or her death was paying an annual instalment by virtue of the provisions of section 19* or to the holding of an owner if he refuses to succeed to that land or holding, or, if the nominated successor does not enter into possession of that land or holding within a period of six months reckoned-

(i) where such permit-holder or owner dies without leaving behind his or her spouse, from the date of the death of such permit-holder or owner; or (ii) where such permit-holder or owner dies leaving behind his or her spouse, from the date of the failure of such spouse to succeed, such date being reckoned according to the provisions of paragraph (b) of subsection (1), or of the death of such spouse, as the case may be.”

17. In Leelawathie vs. Perera (2012) 1 Sri LR 246, Dr. Shirani A.

Bandaranayake, C.J., considered Section 68 as follows:

“The applicability of the provisions contained in the original Section 68 was considered in Gunawardena v. Rosalin (1960) 62 N. L. R. 213. In that a grantee of land under the Land Development Ordinance had nominated his sister, the plaintiff, as the life-holder. He had died in 1951 leaving his widow (the 1st defendant) and their son (a minor) who was nominated under the Land Development Ordinance as the successor to the land by letter dated 17. 06. 1948. The plaintiff alleged that the 1st defendant was in unlawful and wrongful possession of the land since the death of the grantee and she claimed the value of the produce. It is to be noted that the plaintiff had never enjoyed the produce of the land or entered into occupation. The Supreme Court considering the provisions of Section 68(1) had held that as the plaintiff did not enter into possession within the period of six (6) months prescribed in Section 68 (1) of the Land Development Ordinance, the successor had succeeded to the holding. In deciding the issue, Basnayake, C. J. had stated thus:

“Section 68 (1) of the Land Development Ordinance provides that a nominated life-holder fails to succeed if he refuses to succeed or does not enter into possession of the holding

WRT-497-2019

Page 11 of 14

within a period of six months reckoned from the date of the death of the owner of the holding.” As stated earlier, the original Section 68 had been replaced with a new section by Land Development (Amendment) Act, No. 16 of 1969. In the new Section 68 instances where failure to succeed to the holding are clearly stated. Accordingly, if the spouse of a permit-holder does not enter into possession of the land or holding in question within a period of six months reckoned from the date of the death of the permit-holder the said spouse would fail to succeed to the land, so held by the permit holder on the permit. It is quite clear that since the death of the appellant's husband in 1988 she had not entered into possession of the paddy field. It had been harvested by the respondent from 1988 until 1992, the appellant in fact had not even being living in the area. The evidence before the District Court clearly reveals that the appellant had not entered into possession at all after 1988 and she had instituted action before the District Court in February 2001. In such circumstances, considering the provisions contained in Section 68 (1) of the Land Development (Amendment) Act, since the appellant had failed to enter into possession of the land in question within a period of six months from the date of the death of the appellant's husband, the appellant is not entitled to claim succession to the land so held by her deceased husband as a permit-holder.” 18. In these circumstances, the Divisional Secretary is entitled and

authorised to consider the nomination of another prescribed person

coming within the Third Schedule. The petitioner is the eldest son of the

original owner and had been in possession of at least a portion thereof.

Therefore the determination that the petitioner be the successor as made

initially is lawful and correct.

Delay.

19. The respondents alleged that the petitioner is guilty of laches or delay.

It has been held that delay by itself does not prevent the exercise of the

WRT-497-2019

Page 12 of 14

Court’s writ jurisdiction in judicial review. In Biso Menika vs. Cyril de

Alwis and Others [1982 (1) SLR 368], Sharvananda J., held as follows:

“When the Court has examined the record and is satisfied the order complained of, is manifestly erroneous or without jurisdiction the Court would be loathed to allow the mischief of the order to continue and reject the application simply on the ground of delay, unless there are very extraordinary reasons to justify such rejection. Where the authority concerned has been acting altogether without basic jurisdiction, the Court may grant relief in spite of the delay unless the conduct of the party shows that he has approbated the usurpation of jurisdiction. In any such event, the explanation of the delay should be considered sympathetically.”

The above was followed and cited with approval in Paudgalika The

Kamhal Himiyange Sangamaya also known as The Private Tea

Factory Owners Association vs. H. D. Hemaratna, Tea

Commissioner and Others (SC/Appeal/47/2011, decided on

09.03.2015), where K. Sripavan, C.J., held,

“The Court may therefore in its discretion entertain an application in spite of the fact that a petitioner comes to Court late, especially where the order challenged is a nullity. The conduct of the petitioner cannot be branded as unreasonable to disentitle it to a Writ especially when the decisions contained in the letters marked P12 and P13 are ultra vires the powers of the Tea Commissioner.” “There has undoubtedly been great delay in challenging the validity or legality of the said circulars. However, the rule of laches or delay is not a rigid rule which can be cast in a straightjacket formula, for there may be cases where despite delay and creation of third-party rights, the Court may still in the exercise of its discretion interfere and grant relief to the petitioner.” In Pathirana vs. Victor Perera (DIG Personal Training Police) 2006

(2) SLR 281, it was held that while the petitioner had technically

disentitled himself to the discretionary relief of certiorari due to his own

conduct, including undue delay and laches, the delay was ultimately

excused because of the nature of the error in the proceedings. The above

was also followed in Dr. N. B. D. N. B. Balalle and others vs. Chief

WRT-497-2019

Page 13 of 14

Accountant, Ministry of Justice and others (CA/Writ/35/2023,

decided on 02.11.2023). Accordingly, as the impugned decision is void

and is a nullity, the delay would not defeat this application.

Conclusion.

20. The substantive relief sought by the petitioner in this application are by

prayers (b) and (c). Prayer (b) seeks “a writ of certiorari to quash the

purported decision of the 1st and the 3rd respondents to transfer the said

high land in the name of the 5th respondent which is reflected in the extract

marked P-4.” As held above, the action by the 1st respondent to cancel

the registration of the succeeding ownership of the petitioner is ultra

vires and void ab initio.

21. Accordingly, writs of certiorari are issued quashing the said decision

and thereby quashing

- the entry appearing in folio 5/1/3/131 of the Register of Permits and

Grants made by the Registrar on 30.09.2004; and

- the entry appearing in folio 5/1/3/131 of the Register of Permits and

Grants made by the Registrar on 04.03.2005 (both depicted in P-4).

22. Now to consider the relief prayed for by prayer (c). The petitioner is

seeking a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to hold an inquiry

in terms of the LDO and the regulations. P-8 confirms that upon the

filing of this application, an inquiry was held as directed by this Court.

The report P-8 is the outcome of the said inquiry. Accordingly, the

consideration of relief as per prayer (c) is now not required.

23. In consequence of the writs so issued, the 1st respondent is directed to

take necessary steps to have the said quashing given effect to and

registered, and the Register be rectified by making a suitable application

to the Registrar of Lands.

WRT-497-2019

24. Accordingly, the application is allowed to that extent. However, I make

no order as to costs.

Application allowed.
