He had died in 1951 leaving his widow (the 1st defendant) and their son (a minor) who was nominated under the Land Development Ordinance as the successor to the land by letter dated 17. 06. 1948. The plaintiff alleged that the 1st defendant was in unlawful and wrongful possession of the land since the death of the grantee and she claimed the value of the produce. It is to be noted that the plaintiff had never enjoyed the produce of the land or entered into occupation. The Supreme Court considering the provisions of Section 68(1) had held that as the plaintiff did not enter into possession within the period of six (6) months prescribed in Section 68 (1) of the Land Development Ordinance, the successor had succeeded to the holding.

In the new Section 68 instances where failure to succeed to the holding are clearly stated. Accordingly, if the spouse of a permit-holder does not enter into possession of the land or holding in question within a period of six months reckoned from the date of the death of the permit-holder the said spouse would fail to succeed to the land, so held by the permit holder on the permit. It is quite clear that since the death of the appellant's husband in 1988 she had not entered into possession of the paddy field. It had been harvested by the respondent from 1988 until 1992, the appellant in fact had not even being living in the area. The evidence before the District Court clearly reveals that the appellant had not entered into possession at all after 1988 and she had instituted action before the District Court in February 2001.
