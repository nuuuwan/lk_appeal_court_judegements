JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted before the

High Court of Puttalam on the count of rape committed on Rajapakshe Arachchilage

Nirmala Manel Kumari, punishable under Section 364 (2)(e) of the Penal Code as

amended by Act No.22 of 1995.

At the trial, the prosecution led the evidence through 8 witnesses, and marked

productions from P1 to P3 and thereafter closed its case. After the conclusion of the

prosecution case, the Accused, in his defence, made a dock statement.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge, by judgment dated

16.07.2024, found the Accused guilty of the charge and imposed a sentence of 12 years of

rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 20,000/- and 3 months of simple imprisonment in

default. Further, a compensation of Rs. 200,000/- was ordered to be paid to the victim; in

default, a term of 1 year of simple imprisonment is imposed.

Being aggrieved by the afore-mentioned conviction and the sentence, the Accused has

preferred this appeal to this Court. The following are the grounds of appeal as pleaded by

the Accused.

1. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the inherent improbable and

contradictory nature of the Prosecutions case;

2. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the glaring contradictions

and the omissions in the evidence of the alleged eyewitness, PW 03, Wijjapathi

Muththalage Sarath Chandradasa, which raises serious concerns about the

authenticity of the Prosecutions case;

3. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the Inter se and per se

contradictions between the material Prosecution witnesses;

4. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the evidence of PW 01

is not corroborated from any independent source, and her evidence does not inspire

confidence;

When the matter was supported on 28.07.2025, the Counsel for the Accused Appellant

informed the Court that he only challenged the sentence imposed and sought a mitigation

in the sentence.

At the inquiry before sentencing, the Accused tendered the following in mitigation.

1. The Accused has no prior convictions

2. At this time, the Accused is approximately 60 years old.

3. The Accuseds wife is in poor health, and he takes her to medical clinics.

4. The Accused actively attended court proceedings related to this case both in the

Magistrate and High Courts, for over nine years.

5. The Accused is also responsible for the care and upbringing of his daughters two

children, who are currently living under his custody.

Further, the following aggravating factors were indicated by the learned State Counsel:

1. The offence was committed by the Accused when the victim was around 14 years

old and the Accused was 51 years old.

2. The Accused, being a close relative to the victim, is a person with a social

responsibility to provide care to the victim.

3. As a result of the incident, PW 01 was unable to return to school and continue

her education as usual due to the trauma she experienced.

The Learned High Court took into account the Supreme Court's judgement in

Badde Liyanage Wasantha Kumara v. Attorney General, SC Appeal 70/2018

emphasizing that sentencing should serve as a deterrent, conveying a clear

message to society and, in particular, to potential perpetrators of sexual assault.

The Court further asserted that individuals who commit such offences against

innocent children must be subjected to appropriate punishment, underscoring the

paramount importance of safeguarding children from such offenders.

The prescribed sentence or penalty written in law for the offence of rape is found in Section

364 (2)(e) of the Penal Code.

(2) Whoever

(e) commits rape on a woman under eighteen years of age; shall be punished

with rigorous imprisonment for a term not test than ten years and not

exceeding twenty years and with fine and shall in addition be ordered to

pay compensation of an amount determined by court to the person in

respect of whom the offence was committed for the injuries caused to such

person;

Our courts have considered that the Learned High Court Judge should indicate on what

basis he has imposed 12 years of rigorous imprisonment, where the minimum sentence

that could be imposed is 10 years. It is well established in our courts that when a trial

judge evaluates both mitigating and aggravating circumstances, they are obligated to

provide a balanced and reasoned assessment. Furthermore, it is recognized that the base

sentence for this offence is 10 years.

In Archbold: Sentencing Guidelines (2019), Thomson Reuters, on page 274, under the

heading of applicability of guidelines on sexual offences, it is stated that;

Starting points define the position within a category range from which to start

calculating the provisional sentence.

Page 5 of 6

Once the starting point is established, the court should consider further

aggravating and mitigating factors and previous convictions so as to adjust the

sentence within the range. Starting points and ranges apply to all offenders,

whether they have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trial.

His Lordship S.N. Silva J (as he was then) in the case of Attorney General Vs. Ranasinghe

and Others (1993) 2 SLR 81 had referred to the judgment of Kieth Billiam (1986) Volume

Page 4 of 6 82 Criminal Appeal Report 347, where the Court had identified the following

instances as aggravating features.

1. Violence is used to commit the rape.

2. A weapon is used to frighten the victim.

3. Rape is repeated.

4. The Defendant had a previous conviction of rape or other serious offences.

5. The victim is either very old or very young.

Further held that where any one or more aggravating factors are present, the sentence

should be substantially higher than the figure suggested as the starting point.

In the present case, the Accused was convicted of an offence carrying a statutory penalty

of imprisonment ranging from 10 to 20 years. The Learned High Court has imposed a

sentence of 12 years rigorous imprisonment. It is evident that the Learned High Court

Judge has given careful consideration to both mitigating and aggravating factors relevant

to the case. The sentencing decision clearly reflects a measured and balanced evaluation,

with appropriate weight given to the mitigating circumstances.

The Learned High Court Judge carefully weighed all mitigating and aggravating factors

before imposing a sentence of 12 years rigorous imprisonment. This decision reflects the

broader concern about the risk of such injustices recurring, and underscores societys

dependence on the justice system to uphold a deterrent effect, preserving social order and

preventing the escalation of crime.

Considering all these aspects, we find no justification to interfere with the sentence

handed down by the Learned High Court Judge on 16.07.2024.

The Sentence is backdated to the date of conviction, namely 16.07.2014.

Furthermore, we make no change in the fine and the compensation imposed on the

Accused.

The Registrar of this court is directed to send this judgment to the High Court of Puttalam

for compliance.
