RESPONDENTS

Before: M. T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J (President C/A)- Acting. K. P. FERNANDO, J. Counsel: M. A. Sumanthiran P.C. with Darshika Ariyanayagam for the

Petitioners, instructed K. M. S. R. Perera. Sumathi Dharmawardena A.S.G. with Avindra de Silva S.S.C. for the Respondents. Supported on: 28. 04. 2025 Decided on: 20. 05. 2025 MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. (President of The Court of Appeal- Acting)

The Petitioners are seeking, inter alia, writs of certiorari quashing the decision of the

3rd Respondent to table the draft amended constitution of Sri Lanka Rugby, quashing

any amendments to the constitution of Sri Lanka Rugby, and a writ of prohibition

prohibiting the 1st to 4th Respondents from causing any amendments to the said

constitution. Moreover, the Petitioners are seeking interim orders preventing the 1st to

4th Respondents from causing any amendments to the said constitution.

On 10/07/2024, this Court issued formal notices on the Respondents and an interim

order as prayed for in paragraph h) of the prayers to the Petition. Thereafter, limited

objections were filed by the state on behalf of the Respondents. On 04/12/2024 the

matter was settled on the terms set out below

Page 3 of 7

1. The competent authority, the Director General of sports shall call an annual

general meeting of Sri Lanka rugby in order to elect office bearers at the earliest.

2. The elected office bearers shall submit the amendments proposed by World

Rugby to amend the constitution of the Sri Lanka rugby at a special general

meeting which will be conducted on or before 28/01/2025.

3. The elected members of Sri Lanka Rugby shall place the amendments proposed

by the World Rugby at the special general meeting agenda in order to adopt the

said amendments.

4. A special general meeting and the AGM shall be conducted in terms of the

provisions set out as per sports law, sports regulations and the provisions set

out in the constitution of the Sri Lanka rugby

Accordingly, on 05/12/2024, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner informed Court

that he had received instructions from the Petitioners to withdraw the application in

terms of the settlement entered into on 04/12/2024. Accordingly, the application was

dismissed and the proceedings were terminated.

On 05/02/2025, by way of motion and affidavit, the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner informed Court that the 3rd Respondent, the Director General of Sports, had

violated the undertaking given before this Court. Accordingly, this Court issued notice

on the 3rd Respondent. Thereafter, the contempt proceedings were fixed for inquiry.

When the contempt proceedings were taken up for inquiry on 15/05/2025, the learned

Additional Solicitor General appearing for the 3rd Respondent informed Court that the;

1. Contempt proceedings cannot be proceeded with as there is no proper rule

issued by this Court under the provisions of Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or

Institution Act, No. 8 Of 2024.

2. However, the 3rd Respondent has already complied with the said undertaking.

Page 4 of 7

3. The 3rd Respondent could not fully comply with the undertaking due to the

enjoining order issued by the District Court of Colombo in case bearing no

DSP/10/2025

Moreover, the learned Additional Solicitor General informed Court that he is

withdrawing the undertaking given to Court on the basis that the amendments to the

Constitution of Sri Lanka Rugby are to be made on or before 23/05/2025, in

accordance with the instructions given by World Rugby in its letter dated 12/05/2025.

The said letter was submitted to Court by the learned Additional Solicitor General in

open Court.

We heard the learned Additional Solicitor General for the 3rd Respondent and the

learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner in this regard.

Under Section 9 of the Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution Act, No. 8 of 2024,

when an application is filed by way of a motion and affidavit, and the Court is satisfied

that a prima facie case of contempt of Court has been established against the person

alleged to have committed such contempt, the Court will issue a rule against the person

concerned.

It is pertinent to note that, at the outset, the Petitioner, by way of a motion and affidavit,

must satisfy the Court that there is a prima facie case of contempt of court against the

Respondent. It is borne out from the case record that, inadvertently, the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner has not satisfied this Court that there is a prima

facie case against the 3rd Respondent. Moreover, there is no order by this Court stating

that it is satisfied that a prima facie case has been made out against the 3rd Respondent.

It is borne out from the journal entry dated 05/02/2025 that, when the Presidents

Counsel for the Petitioner informed Court of an alleged violation by the 3rd Respondent,

this Court immediately issued notice on the Respondent and fixed a date for rule

Page 5 of 7

returnable on 24/03/2025, an approach contrary to the procedure set out in the said

Act.

Be that as it may, when considering the factual circumstances, it is observed that after

the 3rd Respondent gave an undertaking to hold the Annual General Meeting, an

enjoining order was issued by the District Court of Colombo in Case No. DSP/10/2025,

preventing the 3rd Respondent from conducting the said meeting.

Upon a careful consideration of the factual circumstances, it is evident that the 3rd

Respondent did not possess the mens rea or intention to willfully violate the

undertaking previously given to this Court. Rather, the 3rd Respondent was legally

restrained from acting in compliance with the said undertaking due to an enjoining

order issued by the District Court of Colombo in Case No. DSP/10/2025, which

explicitly prohibited the conduct of the Annual General Meeting.

Therefore, the non compliance with the terms of settlement and the undertaking given

to this Court cannot be attributed to any deliberate or purposeful act on the part of the

3rd Respondent. It is clear that the 3rd Respondent was stopped by a subsisting order of

the District Court, which was beyond his control.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that no prima facie case of contempt of

court has been established against the 3rd Respondent. Accordingly, the purported rule

issued by this Court is hereby recalled.

Further, the learned Additional Solicitor General, appearing on behalf of the State,

brought to the attention of this Court that, as per the communication issued by World

Rugby dated 12/05/2025, failure to amend the Constitution of Sri Lanka Rugby on or

before 23/05/2025 will result in the suspension of Sri Lanka Rugby from the

international rugby community. Such a suspension would severely impair the countrys

representation and participation in international rugby events, and cause irreparable

damage to the sports future in Sri Lanka.

Page 6 of 7

It is pertinent to observe that while Sri Lanka may not yet rival global rugby giants such

as the All Blacks or Springboks, the nations rugby program stands at a critical juncture

in its growth and development. This Court notes the fact that rugby is a sport gaining

increasing momentum and public interest within the country especially with particular

interest in the Schools Rugby arena, and that this period presents a significant

opportunity for Sri Lanka to further integrate into the international rugby community.

In this context, the Court is mindful of the national interest at stake in the present

situation. The letter issued by World Rugby, dated 12/05/2025, indicates that failure to

amend the Constitution of Sri Lanka Rugby on or before 23/05/2025 would lead to Sri

Lankas suspension from international rugby. Such a consequence would be

detrimental not only to the sport but also to the countrys reputation and prospects on

the global stage.

Therefore, in view of the broader public interest and the necessary to preserve Sri

Lankas standing in international rugby, this Court accepts that the withdrawal of the

undertaking by the Respondents, albeit a deviation from the earlier position, is justified

under the circumstances. The urgency and gravity of the potential suspension provide

sufficient basis for allowing the constitutional amendments to proceed, in accordance

with the requirements set out by World Rugby.

I also wish to emphasize that relief under writ jurisdiction is not granted as of right. In

the case of Jayaweera v Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura1 it

was stated as per Jayasuriya, J

a petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a writ of

Certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a

matter of routine, even if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has a discretion to

deny his relief having regard to his conduct, delay, laches, waiver, submission to

jurisdiction, - are all valid impediments which stand against the right of relief.

1 1996 2SLR 70

Page 7 of 7

It is well established that writs are discretionary remedies, and not granted as of right.

In exercising its discretion, this Court must consider not only whether a legal duty has

been breached by the authority concerned, but also the broader context and

implications of granting such relief. Writs are not to be issued in isolation or in a

vacuum, rather, the Court is required to evaluate the overall impact of its judgments,

including the potential effects on third parties and the wider society. The Court must

therefore balance the alleged infringement of legal duty with the public interest and the

practical consequences that may follow from judicial intervention.

Presently, where the State has chosen to withdraw the undertaking for reasons

grounded in national interest and international compliance, the Court is of the view that

such withdrawal cannot be prevented by judicial intervention, particularly when it is

neither unlawful nor made mala fides.

For the foregoing reasons the purported rule issued by this court against the 3rd

Respondent is recalled. The application to withdraw the undertaking given by the

respondents and/or the terms of settlement, is allowed. Since the main application has

already been dismissed, the proceedings are terminated without costs. Moreover the

contempt proceedings are also dismissed.

Proceedings are terminated. No costs.
