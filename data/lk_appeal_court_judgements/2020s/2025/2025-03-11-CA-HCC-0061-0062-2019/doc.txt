JUDGEMENT

Introduction

1. The 1st and 2nd accused-appellants have preferred separate appeals but

both were listed and taken up for argument together with the consent

and agreement of all Counsel. This judgement will thus determine and

bind both the appeals bearing No. CA-HCC 0061/2019 and No. CA-HCC

0062/2019.

2. The 1st and 2nd accused-appellants were indicted in the High Court of

Ratnapura for the murder of Aparakke Keerthiwansha punishable under

section 296 of the Penal Code and for causing hurt to Nalani De Silva

PW-01 the wife of the Deceased punishable under Section 314 Penal

Code both read with Section 32 of the Penal Code. The trial has

commenced without a jury before the judge in the High Court of

Ratnapura. Then with the establishment of the High Court of

Embilipitiya, this matter had been transferred to that Court and upon

further trial, both the accused-appellants were convicted on count No. 1

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 3 of 28

for murder and sentenced to death but acquitted of count No. 2 that of

hurt.

Facts

3. The facts of this offending may be summarized as follows. The deceased,

worked as a Supervisor in an Indian company and resided in quarters

of the company with his wife, Nalani De Silva (PW-01). On the evening

of the day of the incident the 1st accused visited the deceased persons

quarters on three occasions. On the last visit the 1st accused, Kukul

Koralagamage Gamini Premakumara was accompanied by the 2nd

accused, Senanayakage Sarath Kumara. The 1st accused having said

that the vehicle of their boss had stalled due to a diesel block a short

distance away had requested the deceased for assistance.

4. The deceased, accompanied by his wife (PW-01), had then proceeded on

foot to the purported place but found no vehicle there. Being suspicious,

the deceased and his wife have set off to return home. PW-01 who was

walking ahead, upon hearing her husband shout had turned back and

seen him being held by the 1st accused and being jabbed with a closed

fist. Just then the 2nd accused had pulled PW-01 from her hair and

pushed her to the ground. She had resisted and kicked him when the

2nd accused has then taken to his heels. The 1st accused too had fled the

scene. Then PW-02 Dilshan Amarasinghe happened to come by and then

assisted PW-01 to take the deceased to the hospital. The deceased

appear to have been pronounced dead upon admission to the hospital.

According to PW-01 the possible motive for the attack is that the 1st

accused who was a security guard had been demoted to the position of

a labourer by the deceased.

Grounds of Appeal

5. As per the written submissions the accused-appellants, the grounds of

appeal are as follows:

The 1st appellants grounds of appeal are,

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 4 of 28

1. that the learned trial judge was misdirected by failing to comply

with Section 48 of the Judicature Act No. 02 of 1978 (when the case

was transferred from Ratnapura to Embilipitiya);

2. that the learned trial judge failed to consider the credibility of the

evidence of the PW-01;

3. that the learned trial judge failed to appreciate the relevant

considerations that ought to be taken into account in analysing

circumstantial evidence; and

4. that the learned trial Judge came to an erroneous finding based on

speculations and surmises.

The 2nd accused-appellants grounds of appeal are,

5. that the accused was denied of a fair trial;

6. that the learned trial judge erred in law in failing to properly

evaluate identification of the 2nd accused at the identification

parade; and

7. that the learned trial judge erred in appreciating the Section 27

discovery.

In the course of the argument, the Counsel raised the following ground;

8. The trial judge failed to properly evaluate and determine the

existence of the common murderous intention.

Grounds of Appeal 1 and 5: Failure to comply with Section 48 of

Judicature Act No. 02 of 1978

6. During the course of the argument, both learned counsel for the

respective appellants abandoned the grounds of appeal No. 1 and 5

based on Section 48 of the Judicature Act on the adoption of evidence.

Grounds of Appeal 2, 3, and 4: Failure to consider the credibility of the

evidence of the PW-01; findings based on speculations and surmise;

failure to consider the principles in analysing circumstantial evidence.

7. Grounds of appeal 2, 3, and 4 will be considered together, as they are

interconnected. The sole eye witness is PW-01 and according to her

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 5 of 28

evidence she had seen the 1st accused holding on to the deceased and

jabbing with a closed fist. She had not seen any weapon and it appears

that she herself was pulled and thrown on to the ground by the 2nd

accused. Therefore, she had been able to observe the initial assault on

the deceased. Then she had seen the two accused run away and the

deceased fallen on the ground. It is subsequently that she had observed

blood on the deceased. She had been approximately 2 3 feet away from

the place of the assault. PW-01 has seen this from the light that

emanated from a nearby building and she admits that the surrounding

was not very well lit but there was sufficient light. There had also been

a torch.

8. After the two accused took to their heels, PW-01 had got up and gone to

the deceased who was standing unsteadily and then fallen. She claims

to have been in a state of agitation and fear believing that the assailants

may return, and had switched off the torch. It is then that she heard a

motor bicycle, who happened to be PW-02, Dilshan.

9. Though PW-01 is referred to as an eyewitness, she had not seen the

weapon used to inflict the injuries. According to the medical evidence,

the deceased had nine stab injuries; four on the upper back of the body,

one on the left side of the lower neck, another on the right side close to

the collarbone, and two others towards the left lower chest. As PW-01

had not seen a weapon or a knife at that moment, proof of certain

aspects of the prosecution case is thus based on circumstantial

evidence. That would be the use of the weapon, and as to exactly how

the stab injuries were inflicted, as well as the entertaining and sharing

of the common murderous intention. To that extent, the prosecution

relies on circumstantial evidence inter alia to prove the actual infliction

of the fatal injuries (stab) and sharing of the common murderous

intention. The learned trial judge appears to have not directly adverted

to this in that sense. However, he had come to the finding that the

prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the death of the

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 6 of 28

deceased was committed by the two accused and no other (

). Then the learned trial judge goes on to conclude that the 1st

accused attacked the deceased, but the 2nd accused did not attack, but

acted on a pre-conceived plan and with a common murderous intention

to cause the death of the deceased. The trial judge comes to the finding

that the Prosecution has proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that the

injuries were inflicted by no other but the 1st accused. Therefore, though

it is not expressly so articulated, the necessary inference is that the

learned trial judge has inferentially concluded that the stab injuries were

inflicted by the 1st accused and was sharing the common intention with

the 2nd accused.

Evaluating circumstantial evidence by the trial judge

10. It is correct to say that the trial judge has not considered expressly or

engaged in the analysis of the effect, import and the relevance of

circumstantial evidence vis--vis the relevant principles. However, the

trial judge has, in fact expressly declared that the conclusions and

findings are based both direct evidence and circumstantial evidence (at

page 18 of the judgement and page 352 of the brief). Thus, in effect, the

conclusion and the findings are based on direct evidence as well as the

inferences drawn on circumstantial evidence, and the trial judge had

been mindful of this.

11. One of the complaints of the 1st appellant is that the trial judge had not

expressly adverted to the principles governing the evaluation of

circumstantial evidence and also failed to properly evaluate the

circumstantial evidence. True, on the perusal of the judgement, apart

from the references that the findings are based on circumstantial

evidence, there is no express advertence to the principles governing and

applicable to the evaluation of circumstantial evidence.

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 7 of 28

12. The following decisions do advert to the said principles:

In King vs. Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254, it was held by Soertsz, S.P.J.,

that, In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence, the jury

must be satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the

accused and inconsistent with any reasonable hypotheses of his

innocence.

Similarly in the case of King vs. Gunaratne 47 NLR 145, it was held

that, In a case of circumstantial evidence, the facts given in evidence

may, taken cumulatively, be sufficient to rebut the presumption of

innocence, although each fact, when taken separately, may be a

circumstance only of suspicion. The Jury are entitled to draw inferences

unfavourable to an accused where he is not called to establish an innocent

explanation of evidence given by the prosecution, which, without such

explanation, tells for his guilt.

Then in the case of Krishantha de Silva vs. Attorney General (2003) 1

SLR 162, Edirisuriya, J. held that, It is admitted that this is a case of

circumstantial evidence. In such a case, circumstances relied upon should

be consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with his

innocence. If the circumstantial evidence relied upon can be accounted for

on the supposition of innocence, then the circumstantial evidence fails.

Circumstantial evidence can be acted upon only if, from the circumstances

relied upon the only reasonable inference to be drawn is the inference of

guilt. If the circumstances are consistent both with guilt and with

innocence then the case is not proved on circumstantial evidence. The

hypothesis of innocence must be excluded by the circumstances relied

upon and the circumstances must point to one conclusion alone, i.e. the

guilt of the accused. The learned trial Judge has not discussed in detail

these principles to be followed in appreciating circumstantial evidence in

the instant case.

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 8 of 28

These are some of the salient principles the trial judge ought to have

appraised himself of.

13. Its true that such principles of evaluating circumstantial evidence

should have been considered by the trial judge. If the matter was before

a jury, this specific direction would have been necessary and the failure

would certainly amount to a misdirection or a non-direction. However,

this trial was before a judge, who for all purposes is deemed to be learned

and a trained judicial mind, who can reasonably be considered to have

been aware and mindful of the principles of law relating to

circumstantial evidence.

14. When the trier of fact is a judge with a trained judicial mind, the mere

absence of express advertence or appraisal of such principles may be

viewed differently. This is for the simple reason that trial judges are

presumed to know the law (R. v. Burns, 1994 CanLII 127 (SCC), [1994]

1 S.C.R. 656 at pp. 664-65, 89 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at pp. 199-200]). That

presumption must apply with particular force to basic legal principles

governing and applicable to the evaluation of circumstantial evidence as

well. I find the learned trial judge has in fact made some reference to

and been mindful to these principles in formulating and crafting the

judgment.

Items of proved circumstances

15. I will now consider the available items of circumstantial evidence in this

case and consider if it is sufficient to reasonably have drawn the

inferences and come to the findings as found by the learned trial judge.

According to the medical evidence, the death was caused due to multiple

stab injuries. The learned trial judge had concluded that it was the 1st

accused who caused the death by inflicting these injuries. However,

there is no direct evidence of the accused using a knife or inflicting the

injuries with a knife. PW-01 has only seen the 1st accused jabbing the

deceased with a closed fist. If so, how did the trial judge come to the

conclusion that it was the 1st accused who inflicted these fatal stab

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 9 of 28

injuries? Of course, it is upon the consideration of direct and

circumstantial evidence.

16. The trial judge did clearly advert to the fact that PW-01 did not say that

the 1st accused was armed when he attacked/assaulted the deceased

( 1

at page 15 of the judgement and page 349 of the brief).

Having so observed, then the learned trial judge then expressly stated

that the conclusions and findings are based on the evaluation of both

direct evidence and of circumstantial evidence (

at page 18 of the judgement

and page 352 of the brief).

17. The said items of circumstantial evidence are 1st accused attacking and

jabbing with a closed fist; the medical evidence confirming the existence

of stab injuries and the observation that they are caused by a sharp-

cutting weapon; the recovery of a pointed knife P-08 about 10 feet away

from the scene; the pathologists opinion that the injuries could be

inflicted by this or a similar knife to P-08.

18. When considering the evidence that it was the 1st accused and him

alone who attacked and was grappling with the deceased along with the

other items of circumstantial evidence narrated above, they simply lead

only to one inference, that it was the 1st accused who caused the stab

injuries that caused the death of the deceased. Apart from this inference,

there is absolutely no other reasonable hypothesis possible that is

inconsistent with the guilt of the accused. That being so, even if there is

technically a non-direction, in view of the overwhelming evidence, even

if a reasonable jury or judge correctly directed would certainly have

arrived at the same conclusion. Therefore, there is no miscarriage of

justice that has actually occurred. In such circumstances, even though

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 10 of 28

the points raised for the appellant might be decided in their favour, this

appeal may be dismissed (Lurdu Nelson Fernando and Others v. The

Attorney-General (1998) 2 Sri LR. 329).

Failure to consider the credibility of PW-01

19. The next ground of appeal common to both appellants is that the

learned trial judge failed to consider the credibility of the evidence of the

PW-01. It was submitted that due to poor light, PW-01 could not possibly

have seen the alleged stabbing, and could not have identified the 2nd

accused who was not a person known prior to this day. The argument

advanced is that the trial judge has failed to properly and adequately

consider the testimonial trustworthiness. Testimonial trustworthiness

in this context, especially when it involves identification, encompasses

both the credibility and the reliability.

20. Considering and evaluating the testimonial trustworthiness of a

witness, more often than not, credibility and reliability are referred

to, but is often misconceived. Sometimes credibility and reliability are

used interchangeably or as synonyms, which is a serious misconception

and is erroneous. There is a subtle but significant and a very relevant

difference and distinction between credibility and reliability which every

trial judge should be mindful of. Credibility or veracity relates to the

witnesss sincerity, that is his or her willingness to speak the truth as

the witness believes it to be. Reliability, on the other hand, concerns and

relates to the actual accuracy of the witnesss testimony. The accuracy

of a witnesss testimony involves consideration of the witnesss ability to

accurately observe, recall and recount the events in issue. When one is

concerned with a witnesss veracity, one speaks of the witnesss

credibility. When one is concerned with the accuracy of a witnesss

testimony, one speaks of the reliability of that testimony.

Obviously, a witness who is not credible, cannot give reliable evidence

on that same point. The evidence of a credible or an honest witness,

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 11 of 28

may, however, still be unreliable. [vide; R. v. Morrissey (1995), 22 O.R.

(3d) 514 (C.A.), Doherty J.A. (at p. 526): 2014 MBCA 74 (CanLII).

This distinction and difference between credibility and reliability was

adverted to in the Canadian case of R. v. H.C., [2009 ONCA 56, 244

O.A.C. 288 at para. 41,] where Watt J.A. expounded and explained it in

the following lines: Credibility and reliability are different. Credibility has

to do with a witnesss veracity, reliability with the accuracy of the

witnesss testimony. Accuracy engages consideration of the witnesss

ability to accurately, i. observe; ii. recall; and iii. recount events in issue.

21. If I may put this in a simpler form, the credibility relates to the witnesss

willingness to speak the truth sincerely, as the witness believes it to be.

On the other hand, reliability relates to the actual accuracy of the

witnesss testimony. The reliability or accuracy of the testimony will

depend on the witnesss ability and opportunity to accurately observe,

recall, and recount the events in issue which such witness claims to

have perceived.

22. There is, however, an interrelation between credibility and reliability.

The threshold issue to be determined is the credibility. This is so, as a

witness whose testimony is not credible is not a believable witness whose

testimony will not be accepted or acted upon. As such, the next issue of

considering reliability will not arise. If the testimony satisfies the test of

credibility, it will necessarily be that the witness is found to be an honest

witness. However, the mere finding that witness to be credible or honest

will not ipso facto determine the question of reliability of his/her

testimony. Reliability depends on the witnesss ability to accurately,

observe, recall, and recount events in issue so witnessed. The rationale

is that the witness may be honest and would testify as to what the

witness may truly believe that he/she perceived. But even a truthful and

honest witness may be mistaken, or the power of observation and the

capacity to recall may be impaired or weak. It is more of an honest

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 12 of 28

mistake. So, the reliability of the witness observation must also be

tested. This depends on various factors, such as lighting, visibility, and

eyesight; the proximity of the witness; his opportunity for observation,

both as to time and situation and also witnesses ability to observe, recall

and recount. The failure of a trial judge to consider the reliability of the

evidence may be a factor which an appellate court may consider.

23. Thus, the trial judge should have considered both the credibility and

the reliability of evidence. It is common ground that the 1st accused was

a person known to the witness. The only dispute is the sufficiency of

light. As for the 2nd accused, he was not known to the witness prior to

this day. Prosecution seeks to prove and establish the presence of the

both the accused persons by the testimony of PW-01. As the 1st accused

was a previously known person it is a recognition, and as the 2nd

accused was previously unknown to PW-01, it is an identification that

is made by the witness.

24. There is a subtle but an important difference and a vital distinction

between identification and recognition. The United Nations

International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in its

judgement in Prosecutor v. Luki & Luki (IT-98-32/1-A) expounded

this distinction as follows:

118. The Trial Chamber noted that there was a difference between

identification witnesses, to whom the accused was previously

unknown by sight and recognition witnesses who had prior

knowledge of the accused enabling them to recognise the accused at the

time of the alleged crime. A witnesss prior knowledge of, or level of

familiarity with, an accused is a relevant factor in the assessment of

identification evidence.

Did the trial judge correctly evaluate of the evidence of PW-01?

25. Now, lets consider if the trial judge has evaluated the evidence of PW-

01 in accordance with the aforesaid principles. Whilst summarising the

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 13 of 28

evidence, the trial judge has considered contradictions V1 and V2 and

come to the finding that the said contradictions do not go to the root of

the evidence and are insignificant. At page 21 of the judgement (page

355 of the brief), the evidence of this witness had been considered along

with the totality of the evidence and found that the said evidence is

consistent and is supported by other evidence. During cross

examination, the defence had not seriously assailed the evidence of PW-

01 and had not suggested or made an allegation of fabrication. The

position suggested appears to be that the witness could not have seen

this incident due to there not being sufficient light. As for the 2nd

accused, the challenge was on the identification of the 2nd accused,

however, had not made any suggestion of fabricating or giving false

evidence. If at all the basis is that of a mistaken identity. Considering

the totality of the evidence, the learned trial judge had clearly come to a

correct conclusion on the credibility of these witnesses.

26. As for reliability, the main challenge on behalf of both the accused is

based on poor light. The fact that there was light emanating from a

nearby building is testified to by this witness as well as confirmed by the

other witnesses, including the Police observations of the scene.

Therefore, though not the best, a sufficient degree of illumination had

been available for the witness to see and observe the incident. It is her

testimony that the two accused were seen at her house and all of them

walked for approximately an hour until they reached the place of

incident. The 1st accused was a person who was previously known and

seen by the witness well before the incident. However, the 2nd accused

was seen for the first time, when he came to her house that evening.

27. The 1st accused being a known person, it was a recognition that she

had made of him. However, as the 2nd accused was seen for the first

time, it is more an identification she had made.

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 14 of 28

Identity of the 1st accused

28. Did the trial judge err in the evaluation of the reliability as far as the

identity of the 1st accused is concerned? As stated above, the 1st accused

clearly being a person who was familiar and known, PW-01 had no

difficulty in recognizing him. As at the point of incident, PW-01 had been

2-3 feet away when she saw the 1st accused grappling with the deceased.

She clearly claims to have recognised that it was no one but the 1st

accused who attacked the deceased with a closed fist. The issue raised

in this appeal on behalf of the first accused is that PW-01 had not

observed a knife. If there was sufficient light, she ought to have seen the

weapon and identified the same, which she had not been able to do. The

submission is that due to lack of sufficient light, she could not have seen

and recognised the assailant. The learned trial judge had concluded

otherwise.

29. This court is now required to consider if this finding is reasonable and

correct. The 1st accused was no stranger. He was approximately 2-3 feet

away from the witness. Even under poor conditions of light, it is very

possible that you could recognize a known person. Especially when that

person was there with the witness and the deceased during the

immediate hour preceding the incident. However, in poor conditions of

light, it is quite possible that you may not be able to see a knife which

was concealed in the hand, partly due to the poor light, and partly due

to the circumstances. The circumstance so contemplated is that the

witness was able to see basically the initial attack or the commencement,

as the 2nd accused had soon thereafter pulled the witness down by her

hair. This may have deprived the witness of the opportunity and

occasion of observing the weapon in the hand. However, as to the

assailant and the act he was engaged in could easily have been observed

even under these conditions. It is exactly this, that appears to have

happened. The fact that the witness had testified so, establishes that

she had deposed to only what she had actually seen and observed.

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 15 of 28

This clearly demonstrates that PW-01 is a truthful witness and that she

is also a reliable witness. The learned trial judge has come to this

conclusion though not in that direct form. Thus, the finding on the

testimonial trustworthiness of PW-01s evidence is correct and lawful

which there is no basis to interfere with.

Ground of Appeal No. 6: That the learned trial judge erred in law in

failing to properly evaluate identification of the 2nd accused at the

identification parade.

30. As for the 2nd accused, he was not a person known to the witness prior to

the day of the incident. It is for the first time that the witness had happened

to see the 2nd accused. Therefore, this is a question as to the identification

and not a question of recognition.

31. In this circumstance, the main issue is whether PW-01 had the opportunity

and the occasion to sufficiently observe and see the 2nd accused. According

to her evidence, the 2nd accused had accompanied the 1st accused that

evening and there was sufficient light at their house to see and observe the

2nd accused. Further, the witness along with the deceased had spent a

considerable amount of time (approximately an hour) walking up to the

place of the incident. It is in evidence that line rooms, a food outlet and

factory buildings were found along the road. Thus, there is light emanating

from the illumination of these placed. At the place of the incident too, there

is evidence that light emanating from a building was sufficient to observe

and identify a person. In this backdrop, the opportunity the witness had

was certainly not a fleeting glance so to say. The evidence certainly

establishes that PW-01 did have sufficient time, space, and opportunity to

observe and to familiarise with the identifying features of the 2nd accused.

To that extent, though the witness had made an identification, it may be

considered to be a recognition which the witness made at the point of the

attack.

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 16 of 28

32. An identification parade has also been held on 06.12.1996 where the 2nd

accused had been positively identified by PW-01. However, at the

identification parade, an objection had been raised on behalf of the 2nd

accused that she was shown to the witness whilst being held at the Police

Station. During the trial, the defence had attempted to mark a contradiction

on this issue from the evidence given by PW-01 at the non-summary

inquiry. It appears that the witness had admitted having seen the 2nd

accused at the Police Station in her evidence given at the non-summary

inquiry, but denied this at the trial. The learned trial judge has proceeded

to consider this contradiction marked 2V1. However, on a perusal of the

evidence and as conceded by the counsel, it is apparent that the above

contradiction had not been proved. During the course of the argument, the

learned counsel for the 2nd appellant proceeded to submit that as the trial

judge had considered the merits of the purported contradiction the absence

of proof is not relevant.

33. Raising and marking of contradictions is provided for by Section 145 of the

Evidence Ordinance. Unless a contradiction raised is admitted, the same

requires to be proved for it to become admissible. It is then that it can be

considered by the trial judge. When a contradiction is raised and the

relevant portion is put to the witness, the witness may admit the same. If

so, further proof is not required as the contradictory portion is thus

admitted. It is then an admitted contradiction. Similarly, the witness may

either deny making the previous statement or claim forgetfulness, then it is

incumbent upon the cross-examining party to prove the existence of the

said previous contradicting statement. If the same emanates from a

statement to the Police, then the Officer who recorded the statement

requires to be summoned and the existence of the contradictory statement

be proved. Similarly, when such contradiction is found in the non-summary

evidence the same may be proved by calling the Registrar or an Officer of

the High Court who has the custody of the original Magistrates Court

record. In the absence of such proof, for all purposes, the trial judge cannot

take cognizance of such contradiction which remains not proved. This

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 17 of 28

applies both to the prosecution as well as the defence without any

distinction. That being so, the trial judge has proceeded on the mistaken

premise that contradiction 2V1 was proved. However, notwithstanding the

same, I see no error or unreasonableness in the manner the learned trial

judge had considered and disregarded the said contradiction.

34. As evaluated herein above, PW-01 had the opportunity to sufficiently

perceive and familiarise herself as to the identifying features. Strictly

speaking, an identification parade may not have been necessary as it was

not a momentary fleeting glance or a mere opportunity to see during the

assault and no more, if so, an identification parade may have been

necessary and important. In the circumstances of this case and in the

sequence of events, the importance of the identification parade would be

marginal. Therefore, this issue raised does not affect the reliability of the

identity of the 2nd accused. Accordingly, ground of appeal No. 06 is

misconceived and is devoid of merit.

Ground of Appeal No. 7: That the learned trial judge erred in

appreciating the Section 27 discovery.

35. The 2nd appellant also takes up the ground that a recovery based on

Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance has been erroneously considered

against the 2nd accused, when in fact, there is no evidence to link or

connect the said items recovered (pair of socks) to this offending or

incident.

36. The recording of a statement and a recovery made under Section 27 of

the Evidence Ordinance is a fact. However, the recovered item (a pair of

socks) is not proved to be, in any way, connected to this incident.

However, the learned trial judge has in the passing, commented that the

said recovery is an item of evidence against both the accused. In the first

instance, this recovery was made on a statement made by the 2nd

accused. As such, it has no relevance to the 1st accused. On a

consideration of the totality of the judgement, apart from the mere

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 18 of 28

comment, the learned trial judge has not in any way utilised or

considered the said recovery as a relevant item of circumstantial

evidence in arriving at the conclusion. To that extent, there is no

prejudice that has been caused to the appellants by the reference to this

recovery.

Ground of Appeal No. 8: That the trial judge failed to properly evaluate

and determine the existence of common murderous intention.

37. During the course of the argument, the learned counsel for the 2nd

accused-appellant did, in the passing, submit that the trial judge had

not considered the principles governing common intention and the

evidence does not establish beyond reasonable doubt that the 2nd

accused did in fact share a common murderous intention with the 1st

accused. At pages 18 and 19 of the judgement, the trial judge has come

to the finding that both the accused were actuated by a common

murderous intention when they committed the death of the deceased.

The trial judge found that the 1st accused had in fact inflicted the fatal

injuries but there is no evidence that the 2nd accused did in any way

assault or attack the deceased directly. Therefore, in view of the

arguments advanced, it is necessary to consider if there is sufficient

evidence to draw the inference of the 2nd accused entertaining a common

murderous intention.

38. The pith and substance of the submission was that, even if the Court

was to accept the prosecutions case in its totality, still for all, available

evidence does not disclose the criminal culpability of entertaining the

common murderous intention to commit the murder on the part of the

2nd accused. It was argued that the proved circumstances do not give

rise to the sole, irresistible, and inescapable inference that the 2nd

accused did entertain a common intention together with the 1st accused,

to commit the murder of the deceased. In the circumstances it was

submitted that no reasonable conclusion could be even inferentially

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 19 of 28

drawn that the 2nd accused together with the 1st accused entertained a

common intention to cause the death as alleged.

39. The principal offender is the 1st accused who acted with the murderous

intention. Thus, it is necessary to establish that the 2nd accused was

sharing the said intention to commit the death of the deceased and of

active participation.

40. As for the law, Section 32 of the Penal Code reads as follows:

When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the

common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the

same manner as if it were done by him alone.

Section 32 lays down only a principle of criminal liability and such

conduct must be in furtherance of the common intention shared with

the principal perpetrator. (Attorney-General vs. Munasinghe and

Others 70 NLR 241). In The King vs. Assappu 50 NLR 324, Dias, J.

held that if common intention is required to be considered in a trial the

jury be directed as following vital and fundamental principles:

(a) the case of each prisoner must be considered separately;

(b) that the Jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that

he was actuated by a common intention with the doer of the

criminal act at the time the alleged offence was committed;

(c) they must be told that the benefit of any reasonable doubt on

this matter must be given to the prisoner concerned 47 N. L. R.

at p 375;

(d) the Jury must be warned to be careful not to confuse Same or

similar intention entertained independently of each other with

Common intention;

(e) that the inference of common intention should never be reached

unless it is a necessary inference deducible from the circumstances

of the caseA. I. R. 1945 P. C. 118;

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 20 of 28

(f) the Jury should be told that in order to justify the inference that

a particular prisoner was actuated by a common intention with the

doer of the act, there must be evidence, direct or circumstantial,

either of pre-arrangement, or a pre-arranged plan, or a declaration

showing common intention, or some other significant fact at the

time of the commission of the offence, to enable them to say that a

co-accused had a common intention with the doer of the act, and

not merely a same or similar intention entertained independently

of each other 47 N. L. R. at p. 375, 48 N. L. R. 2 95;

(g) the Jury should also be directed that if there is no evidence of

any common intention actuating the co-accused, or any particular

co-accused, or if there is any reasonable doubt on that point, then

the charge cannot lie against anyone other than the actual doer of

the criminal act44 N. L. R. 370, 46 N. L. R. 135, 473, 475;

(h) in such a case such co-accused would be liable only for such

criminal acts which they themselves committed;

(i) the Jury should also be directed that the mere fact that the co-

accused were-present when the doer did the criminal act does not

per se constitute common intention, unless there is other evidence

which justifies them in so holding 45 N. L. R. 510 ; and

(j) the Judge should endeavour to assist the Jury by examining the

case against each of the co-accused in the light of these principles.

These principles will equally be relevant to a judge in a non-jury trial.

41. In Kalanchidewage Suresh Nandana vs. Attorney General (SC Appeal

130/2014 - SCM 14.14/2019, Supreme Court Minutes, 9th February

2024), Justice Achala Wengappuli opined that in a case based on

common intention, the court must consider the existence of evidence

which confirm a participatory presence by each of the accused who are

alleged to have entertained the common intention. In this instance it

is the common intention to commit the murder of the deceased.

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 21 of 28

42. To prove the sharing of the common murderous intention of the 2nd

accused, the prosecution relies on circumstantial evidence. There is no

express assertion or utterance by the 2nd accused indicating so or from

which an inference to that effect may be drawn. Taking at its best, the

items of evidence available to establish the sharing of the common

intention are as follows: the fact that the 2nd accused came along with

the 1st accused; the fact that, when the first accused attacked the

deceased the 2nd accused did simultaneously pull the witness to the

ground by her hair; and after the attack, the 2nd accused did run away

with the 1st accused.

43. These are the circumstances which have been proved by the

prosecution. Is it possible to draw the inference of the 2nd accused

entertaining and sharing the common intention to commit murder?

When these circumstances are considered in its totality, the inference

that there was an understanding between the two accused and that they

were acting together can be drawn. This inference strongly emanates

from the fact that when the deceased was attacked by the 1st accused,

the 2nd accused did himself spontaneously get activated and

simultaneously attacked PW-01, preventing her from going to the

assistance of the deceased. This, without a doubt, indicates that the 2nd

accused did know beforehand and was anticipating some attack or

assault on the deceased. If not, in the normal course, it is not possible

for the 2nd accused to act swiftly and spontaneously in that manner.

44. By so preventing PW-01 from approaching the deceased the 2nd accused

has clearly facilitated the 1st accused to attack the deceased without any

hindrance or interruption. Then the 2nd accused had also gone along

with the plan of the 1st accused to lure the deceased on a false pretext

of a vehicle breakdown. Finally, they runaway and escape together.

45. As stated above, there is no evidence of any direct utterance of whatever

nature by the 2nd accused. It is the 1st accused who had the motive to

harm the deceased, which was his demotion attributed to the deceased.

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 22 of 28

In the absence of any other evidence, it is possible to infer that the 2nd

accused knew that the 1st accused would cause some serious harm, but

as to whether that was the murder is not the only irresistible inference

that can be drawn from these proved circumstances. Though the learned

trial judge had considered and adverted his mind to circumstantial

evidence, he has failed and consider if the only irresistible inference was

one consistent with entertaining common murderous intention. In the

Ariyaratne v. Attorney-General. ( S.C. 31/92-SCM 15.11.93) G.P.S.de

Silva, C.J. reiterated that, the inference of common intention must be not

merely a possible inference, but an inference from which there is no

escape.

There may be very suspicious circumstances but that cannot amount to

legal proof. Then on the evidence if there be two possibilities the one

which is in favour accused should be preferred as the accused is entitled

to the benefit of any reasonable doubt. This is specially so and relevant

where the guilt of the accused is sought to be established by

circumstantial evidence.

46. Having considered the evidence against the 2nd accused, I am of the

view that evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction of murder

based on common intention as against the 2nd accused-appellant. In

these circumstances, it is apparent that the prosecution has failed to

prove beyond reasonable doubt of the 2nd accused entertaining the

common murderous intention. To that extent, the learned trial judge has

erred, and accordingly the conviction against the 2nd accused for murder

cannot be sustained.

47. However, the proved circumstances certainly give rise to a very strong

and irresistible inference of entertaining and sharing between the

accused persons, a common intention to assault and cause grievous

hurt to the deceased. Thus, it is now necessary to consider if the 2nd

accused can be convicted for the lesser offence of causing grievous hurt

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 23 of 28

on the basis of common intention when the 1st accused is found guilty

of murder.

48. I find that in Kripal v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1954 SC 706, the

Indian Supreme Court has considered a similar matter, which I will now

advert to. In this case, the Court considered an appeal filed by three

Appellants named Sheoraj, Kripal, and Bhopal, all of whom were

convicted for murder on the basis of common intention. This appeal was

in respect of two murders but the immediate issue considered was in

respect of the murder of one of the deceased named Jiraj.

The facts of the incident have been summarised in the judgment as

follows: The three appellants were working the well (Milakwala well) that

morning. When they saw Man Singh and Sher Singh going past the well

they asked them where they were going. On being told that they were

going to harvest Jiraj's sugarcane field they abused them and told them

not to go there but to work for them. Man Singh and Sher Singh did not

listen to them and walked on. When they had gone 30-40 paces, the three

appellants rushed at them and began to beat them with the handles of

spears which were in the hands of Bhopal and Kripal and with a lathi

(Lathi is a long heavy wooden stick used as a weapon in India) which

was in Sheoraj's hand. Jiraj (the deceased) arrived at the spot and asked

the appellants why they were beating his labourers and stopped them

from beating them. Sheoraj hit him on the legs with his lathi and he fell

down. Kripal stabbed him with his spear near the ear. Bhopal then

stabbed him with his spear on the left jaw, put his legs on his chest and

extracted the spear blade from his jaw. Just as the blade came off, Jiraj

died.

It was found that only simple hurt was caused to the deceased by the

blows inflicted by Sheoraj and Kripal, and that it was Bhopal who

inflicted the injury that caused the death. The High Court of Uttar

Pradesh, convicted all three accused for murder on the basis of common

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 24 of 28

intention. In appeal, the Respondents argued that the common intention

of the three accused was to kill the deceased Jiraj, which the supreme

Court did not accept and held that:

"We are, therefore, unable to upheld the view taken by the High Court

that any common intention to kill the deceased can be attributed to the

three appellants. Therefore, the only common intention that can be

attributed to all the three appellants in so far as the assault on Jiraj is

concerned is the common intention to beat Jiraj with the weapons in their

hands, which were likely to produce grievous injuries. In this view,

therefore all the three would be guilty in respect of their assault on Jiraj

for an offence under Section 326 I.P.C. while Bhopal alone would be

guilty in respect of the offence under S. 302 I.P.C. It follows from that the

conviction of both Kripal and Sheoraj under Section 302. I.P.C. must be

set aside but that of Bhopal has to be maintained." (Section 326 is

grievous hurt and Section 302 is murder under the Indian Penal Code.)

The Supreme Court upheld and affirmed the conviction of Bhopal under

Section 302 I.P.C., but set aside the conviction of Kripal and Sheoraj

under S. 302 I.P.C. but convicted them under Section 326 I.P.C on the

basis of common intention under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

49. Now in the present appeal, the evidence proves beyond reasonable

doubt that the 1st accused did cause the death of the deceased with the

requisite murderous intention. Hence the 1st accused is guilty and

convicted for murder. However, as there is a reasonable doubt if the 2nd

accused entertained a common intention to commit murder, the 2nd

accused cannot be convicted for the offence of murder punishable under

Section 296 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code. However, there is

clear and cogent evidence to inferentially conclude beyond reasonable

doubt that the two accused were actuated and acted with a common

intention to cause grievous hurt to the deceased.

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 25 of 28

50. Both of them, having decided to cause grievous hurt to the deceased,

acting together with that common intention, did in fact cause grievous

injuries. The medical evidence of the pathologist proves this. The 1st and

2nd accused embark upon the joint enterprise with the common

intention to cause grievous hurt but the 1st accused exceeds the shared

common intention and inflicts multiple stab injuries with the intention

of causing death and the death is caused as a result of the injuries. The

proof in this case being so, the 1st accused is clearly guilty of murder

under Section 296.

51. In these premises, the offence proved and the actual liability of the by

the 2nd accused is for causing grievous hurt under Section 316 read with

Section 32 of the Penal Code. As proved, this is the intention which was

common to both the accused. No doubt, the 1st accuseds unilateral

intention of causing the death exceeded the initial common intention of

causing grievous hurt. However, the 1st accuseds act of inflicting fatal

stab injuries was in furtherance of the common intention to cause

grievous hurt which was exceeded by the 1st accused.

52. The offence of murder committed by the 1st accused certainly includes

and encompasses the offence of causing grievous hurt which is a lesser

offence. Thus, to my mind, it is quite legitimate and lawful to separately

convict the first accused individually under Section 296 for murder.

Similarly, it is also lawfully possible to convict both the 1st and 2nd

accused for committing grievous hurt punishable under Section 316

read with Section 32 of the Penal Code, as it is a lesser offence of murder.

It is relevant to note that the 1st accused could lawfully have been

charged and charges under Section 296 and 316 may have been

included in the same indictment vide Section 179 (3) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act. That being so, as the 1st accused stands

convicted for murder punishable under Section 296, a conviction under

Section 316 read with Section 32 would be superfluous and redundant.

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 26 of 28

53. It would, therefore, be proper to convict the 2nd accused under Section

316 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code. Accordingly, the conviction

against the 2nd accused for the offence of murder, punishable under

Section 296 read with Section 32 is hereby substituted with a finding of

guilt and is convicted for the lesser offence of voluntarily causing

grievous hurt to Aparakke Keerthiwansha, punishable under Section

316 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

54. The Counsel for the 1st accused did concede that the 1st accused had

taken up a completely different position in his dock statement from what

was suggested to PW-01. Though this was so conceded, for

completeness, I would also consider the same.

55. The 1st accused in his dock statement, tries to make out that the wife

of the deceased, PW-01, was having an adulterous relationship with

another and that was seen by the 1st accused which he had then

conveyed to the deceased. He denies being present at the scene on that

day and takes up a total denial. The learned trial judge has rejected and

disregarded the dock statement on the basis that it creates no doubt on

the prosecutions witness version. As stated above, the 1st accused has

taken up a completely new position at the end of the trial. He had not

suggested any aspect of the positions taken in the course of the dock

statement to PW-01. A dock statement requires to be considered in the

same plane as any other evidence and should be subjected to the normal

tests in evaluating the credibility and reliability. In the normal course of

events, a person ought to suggest his position to the witness, especially,

when the narration of the witness is completely different to the position

of the accused. Failure to cross-examine and suggest is a tacit

acceptance of the version as narrated by the witness. As held in the case

of Gunasiri and 2 Others vs. Republic of Sri Lanka 7 [2009] 1 SLR 39,

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has

declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross-

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 27 of 28

examination, it must follow that the evidence tendered on that

issue ought to be accepted.

56. Therefore, when the accused takes up a completely new position at the

end of the trial without suggesting that position to the witnesses, the

said dock statement fails the test of consistency. It does not end there,

but when an extreme position, totally contrary to what transpired in

evidence, is so taken there is a strong inference that this is a false

position taken up at the end of the trial to save himself. The dock

statement of the first Accused is clearly one which is inconsistent and

unreliable. Therefore, the learned trial judge is justified in rejecting the

same and concluding that the dock statement has not been able to

create any doubt in the prosecutions evidence.

Conclusion

57. In the above premises we see no merit in the grounds of appeal raised

on behalf of the 1st accused-appellant. There is overwhelming evidence

to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the 1st accused did cause the

death of the deceased with the requisite murderous intention. Hence, we

see no reason to interfere with the finding of guilt and conviction for

murder as entered against the 1st accused and the sentence.

Accordingly, the appeal of the 1st accused-appellant is dismissed, and

the conviction and sentence imposed on the 1st accused-appellant are

affirmed.

58. As for the grounds of appeal raised on behalf of the 2nd accused-

appellant, we see no merit except ground No.8, which we uphold.

Accordingly, the conviction and sentence against the 2nd accused for the

offence of murder punishable under Section 296 read with Section 32

are varied and substituted. Accordingly, for the reasons as given above,

the 2nd accused is found guilty and is convicted for the lesser offence of

voluntarily causing grievous hurt punishable under Section 316 read

with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

HCC/0061-0062/2019

Page 28 of 28

59. Considering the age, the gravity of the offence, and the fact that he is a

first offender, a sentence of 6 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine

of Rs. 1500/= and in default a sentence of 6 months is ordered in

substitution for the sentence.

60. Upon the conviction and sentence on 25.04.2019, the 2nd accused has

been in remand since preferring this appeal on 03.05.2019. That would

be 5 years and 10 months. By virtue of the proviso to Section 333 (5) of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, as amended by Act No. 25 of 2024,

the time so spent in remand pending the determination of this appeal is

ordered to be considered as a part of his sentence. Accordingly, the said

period is deemed to be a part of the sentence served.

61. The appeal of the 1st accused-appellant is accordingly dismissed and

the conviction and the sentence against the 1st accused-appellant are

affirmed.

62. The conviction and the sentence against the 2nd accused-appellant are

varied and substituted and the appeal of the 2nd accused-appellant is

partially allowed.
