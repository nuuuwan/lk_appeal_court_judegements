ORDER

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J

1. The petitioner is seeking to quash the decision/opinion of the 1st

respondent dated 21.06.2023, contained in the P-12 Quit Notice, and the

application filed in the Magistrates Court of Elpitiya for eviction under

Land Acquisition Act No. 09 of 1950, and to quash the affidavit filed along

with the application made to the Magistrates Court and the relevant

decision/opinion contained in P-14 and P-14(a).

2. P-12 is a Quit Notice, dated 21.06.2023 issued under Section 07 of the

Land Acquisition Act No. 09 of 1950. P-13 is the application preferred to

the Magistrate seeking an Order for Eviction. P-14 is the affidavit which

was annexed along with the application made to the Magistrates Court

seeking an Order for Eviction. P-15 contains the journal entries of the said

application seeking an Order for Eviction in the Magistrates Court of

Elpitiya case No. 37506. The Order for Eviction has been pronounced and

issued on 24.02.2025.

3. The petitioner has not sought any substantive relief against the said

Eviction Order P-22, made and issued on 24.02.2025 but only interim

relief as prayed for by prayer (e). By the said Eviction Order P-22, the

Learned Magistrate has ordered the eviction of the petitioner from Lot B of

the plan marked P-20 (a) and the delivery of possession to the relevant

authorized officer.

4. When this application was filed on 21.05.2025 the said Eviction Order P-

22 issued by the learned Magistrate was in existence. The Eviction Order

is now issued. By this application, the petitioner is seeking to quash

certain steps taken prior to and made in the run up to the said Eviction

Order. As such, the relief sought will be superfluous and futile so long as

the eviction order remains unchallenged and in force. The petitioner ought

to have challenged the Quit Notice before the issue of the Order for

Eviction. A Writ of Mandamus will not be issued if it will be futile and be

of no purpose.

5. A court exercising discretionary jurisdiction has the discretion to refuse

relief where the order sought is likely to be futile. This is so when the order

sought is likely to lack practical effect, have no real consequences or

cannot be enforced. Courts may refuse to make such orders. The rationale

as I see is judicial economy so to say and doing so may have the propensity

of undermining the respect for the legal system and the administration of

justice. Thus, when a court is called to exercise the discretionary writ

jurisdiction it will deny and refuse such an application which evidently has

no practical utility and is futile.

6. This principle is settled law and in the case of Samastha Lanka Nidahas

Grama Niladhari Sangamaya vs. Dissanayake (2013) BLR 68, it was

held that,

It is trite law that no court will issue a mandate in the nature of writ

of certiorari or mandamus where to do so would be vexatious or

futile.

Then Marsoof PC., J., in the case of Ratnasiri and others vs. Ellawala

(2004) SLR 180, and others held that;

This court is mindful of the fact that the prerogative remedies it is

empowered to grant in these proceedings are not available as of right.

The court has a discretion in regard to the grant of relief in the exercise

of its supervisory jurisdiction. It has been held time and time again by

our Courts that A writ... will not issue where it would be vexatious or

futile. See, P.S. Bus Co. Ltd. v Members and Secretary of the

Ceylon Transport Board. (61 NLR 491, 496).

Thus, I find that this application is futile and of no practical utility.

Accordingly, I see no basis to grant Notice as prayed for.

7. That being so, the main argument advanced in support of this application

is that the Quit Notice is in respect of private land. The learned Counsel

for the petitioner, Mr. Nanayakkara, submitted that upon a partition

action the Petitioner was allotted Lot No. 03 of the Final Partition Plan,

bearing No. 1368, marked P-08. His position is that Lot No. D of the said

Plan was excluded from the partition action as it was state land. Lot 3 and

Lot D, are adjacent and appurtenant land. Mr. Nanayakkara also claims

that the respondents are now seeking to evict the petitioner from a portion

of the said Lot No. 3 which was allotted to him by the said Partition Decree.

8. The Quit Notice is in respect of Lot B of the subdivision plan No.

GA/NYG/2019/1089, marked and produced as P-20 (a). The learned State

Counsel submitted that Lot B of plan No. GA/NYG/2019/1089, is not

within Lot No. 03 of the Final Partition Plan. It was further submitted that

the petitioner had encroached and is in possession of Lot B of plan No.

GA/NYG/2019/1089 [P-20 (a)], which is a portion of the excluded Lot D

of the Final Partition Plan, bearing No. 1368, marked P-08 and is State

land.

9. Mr. Nanayakkara vehemently submitted that Lot B of Plan P20 (a) is within

lot 3 of the Final Partition Plan allotted to him in the Partition Decree. If

that be so the only way in which one could ascertain the correct position

and resolve this issue is a duly made superimposition. The petitioner has

not submitted any such superimposition, without which this remains a

disputed fact. It is settled law that where the facts are in dispute, a writ

does not lie. This disentitles the relief sought by way of writ.

10. In Thajudeen vs. Sri Lanka Tea Board and Another (1981) 2 SLR 471,

Ranasinghe, J., opined thus;

That the remedy by way of an application for a Writ is not a proper

substitute for a remedy by way of a suit, especially where facts are

in dispute and in order to get at the truth, it is necessary that the

questions should be canvassed in a suit where the parties would have

ample opportunity examining their witnesses and the Court would be

better able to judge which version is correct, has been laid down in

the Indian cases of Ghosh v. Damodar Valley Corporation A. I. R. 1953

Cal. 581., Porraju v. General Manager B. N. Rly. A. I. R. 1952 Cal.

610. (at page 474).

Then in Kumudu Samanthi Akmeemana vs. Hatton National Bank

and Others, CA/WRT/72/2020 decided on 30.04.2021, Arjuna

Obeyesekere, J., P/CA, held that;

It is not competent for this Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction to

issue writs, to investigate disputed questions of fact. Therefore, this

Court cannot in these proceedings determine whether the Petitioner

has in fact signed the said Deed or not.

Accordingly, the petitioner is not entitled notice and to relief as sought as

the facts are in dispute to that extent.

11. The petitioner, at the time of filing this application was aware and had

notice of the Order of Eviction dated 24.02.2025, which was issued and

was in existence. For reasons unexplained and best known to the petitioner

himself, he makes no challenge of the said Order of Eviction. The relief,

even if granted as prayed for in this application will not affect the said

Order of Eviction P-22. Thus, this application is futile. Accordingly, the

petitioner cannot have and maintain this application on the basis of futility

and as the facts are in dispute. As such, there is no basis in law or

otherwise to issue Notice as prayed for.

12. Issuing of Notice is hereby refused and this application is accordingly

dismissed without costs.
