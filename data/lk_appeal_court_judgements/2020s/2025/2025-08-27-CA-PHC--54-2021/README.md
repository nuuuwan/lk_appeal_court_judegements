D.Thotawatte, J.

This appeal arises from the order of the High Court of the Province of Uva holden atMonaragala dated 6th August 2021, whereby the Appellants application under Section24 of the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act No. 28 of 1996, asamended by Act No. 33 of 2003.

The Petitioner-Appellant Wellakke Liyanage Rasika Niroshana Liyanage (Hereinafterreferred to as Appellant) claims he had suffered from a disability since about 1993 dueto an accident; however, he also claims he had done his BA and MA between 2003 and2011 and had been employed at the Social Services Department from 2006 to 2020.

In 2004/2005, under Minute on the Sri Lanka Administrative Service published inExtraordinary Gazette No. 1419/3 dated 14th November 2005, the Appellant had sat for acompetitive examination in order to obtain an appointment to the Sri LankaAdministrative Service and had obtained 135 marks.

Although the Appellant has annexed the result sheet to the petition submitted to theHigh Court (averment 10 of the petition) in order to establish that he had passed theexamination, that fact is not borne out by the result sheet. However, nothing regardingthis matter has been mentioned in the petition of appeal filed in this Court, and theCounsel appearing for the Appellant in his oral submissions informed the court that the135 marks received by the Appellant are below the cut-off marks for the saidexamination. It appears that the Petitioner had attempted to mislead the High Court.

The instant appeal is completely based on a public Administration circular issued to allSecretaries of Ministries, Heads of Departments and Chairmen of Corporations in 1988bearing No. 27/88 ordering that in recruiting persons to government service or to

4

cooperations, 3% should be recruited from disabled persons who are qualified and whosework will not be affected by the disability.

I have reproduced the circular No. 27/88 (English Version) below for easy reference.

Providing Employment for the Disabled

When vacancies in the Public Service and the Public Corporations are beingfilled.

(1) Three per cent (3%) of such vacancies should be filled by disabled

persons possessing the requisite qualifications and whose disability wouldnot be a hindrance to the performance of their duties. and

(2) Their recruitment too, should be in accordance with the approved

Schemes of recruitment/ Service Minutes.

It is the contention of the counsel for the Appellant that, according to this circular, theinitial recruitment should have been done after reserving the 3% for the disabled, andafter the normal recruitment is done, disabled persons (only) should be considered forthe reserved or remaining 3%.

However, it appears that this argument conveniently ignores the part of the said circularthat states possessing the requisite qualifications. It is clear that one of the thresholdrequirements is that the disabled person should be qualified, or simply that the candidateshould be competent. Accordingly, in order to be considered under this circular, therelevant candidate should have received over the minimum qualifying threshold marks.Having received marks over the minimum qualifying threshold, a disabled person wouldhave an advantage in the recruitment process over a normal candidate due to the 3%quota.

To give circular No. 27/88 the meaning proposed by the Counsel for the Appellant wouldbe to contemplate an absurd situation where a person who would be otherwiseunqualified to do a particular job will be entrusted with it simply because he is disabled.

On the above ground alone, the argument of the Appellant and consequently this Appealshould fail. However, for the sake of completeness, I proceed to consider the flaws in thisappeal.

It is sixteen years after the examination in question that the Appellant had challenged theresult by way of a special application under Section 24 of the Protection of the Rights ofPersons with Disabilities Act No. 28 of 1996, as amended by Act No. 33 of 2003. As towhy it took such an extraordinarily long time has not been satisfactorily explained to theCourt. The Appellant has not alleged any continuing prejudice or a persistent conditionjustifying the extraordinary belated invocation for relief. I hold that in the absence of anyjustification, the Petitioner is disentitled to equitable relief.

For a person to seek relief under Section 24 of the Protection of the Rights of Personswith Disabilities Act No. 28 of 1996, as amended, he should be able to prove that therehas been a contravention of the provisions of Section 23.

Section 23 of the Act reads thus;

1) No person with a disability shall be discriminated against on the grounds of such

disability in recruitment for any employment or office or admission to anyeducational institution,2) No person with a disability shall, on the ground of such disability, be subject to any

liability, restriction or condition with regard to access to, or use of, any building orplace which any other member of the public has access to or is entitled to use,whether on the payment of any fee or not.

No evidence had been advanced by the Appellant suggesting improper bias,discriminatory intent or any other conditions specified in Section 23 with regard to theselection authorities at the time he faced the competitive examination. Given that thePetitioner failed to meet the qualification criterion, his failure to secure recruitmentcannot be attributable to the disability, as it was due to merit-based constraints. TheAppellant cannot allege discriminatory non-recruitment on account of a physicaldisability, as he was unsuccessful due to failure to meet the qualifying threshold.

No evidence was advanced suggesting improper bias or discriminatory intent on the partof the selection authorities.

As to who is considered a person with a disability is defined in Section 37 of the act.

"Person with disability" means any person who, as a result of anydeficiency in his physical or mental capabilities, whether congenital ornot, is unable by himself to ensure for himself, wholly or partly, the

6

necessities of life.

Section 37 defines a person with disability as one who is unable, due to a deficiency inphysical or mental capabilities, to ensure the necessities of life. The threshold issubstantial impairment affecting daily living.

The medical reports before the High Court do not demonstrate such incapacity. Theymerely note a minor spinal protrusion not affecting mobility or self-care. The Counselappearing for the Appellant admitted that insufficient evidence has been submitted toestablish that the Appellant falls into the category of a person with disability asenvisaged by the Act.

In Sri Lankan law, the principle he who asserts must prove is firmly recognised andapplied, both in civil and criminal proceedings. This principle reflects the burden of proofand is rooted in the Evidence Ordinance of Sri Lanka1.

I therefore concur with the High Courts finding that the Petitioner does not satisfy thestatutory definition of a person with disability.

On the above grounds, I hold that the High Court did not err in dismissing the applicationin limine for lack of merit and due to laches. Accordingly, the appeal must fail.

The Application is dismissed without costs.
