Page 3 of 11

ii. During the course of the same transaction, you did possess

03.35 grams of Diacetyl Morphine, an offence punishable in

terms of section 54A(d) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (as amended by Act No. 13 of

1984).

03. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge has

acquitted the appellant of the first charge and convicted him of the

second charge. Thereafter, has sentenced the appellant as follows;

Charge 02

Life imprisonment.

Case of the prosecution

04. On May 08, 2013, PW01, S.I. Handunhetti, had been assigned to

the Police Narcotics Bureau. That day he has received a tip from an

informant regarding an individual who was expected to peddle

narcotics near the Odel Shopping Mall in Colombo 07. In response,

PW01 has decided to conduct a raid and has left the Bureau with

a team of officers including PW03, PC 60485, Matharaarrachchi.

05. Initially, PW01 and his team have travelled to the Ibbamwala

Junction, where PW01 has met his informant. After a brief

discussion, PW01, PW03 and the informant have proceeded on foot

to a location near the Odel Shopping Mall in Colombo 07.

Page 4 of 11

06. Thereafter, the informant has proceeded to identify an individual

as the person mentioned in the information and then receded to

the background. The identified individual has walked past the

officers and stationed himself next to the gate of the particular

shopping mall. Subsequently, the witnesses PW01 and PW03 have

approached the particular individual. Upon PW03 handcuffing him,

PW01 has conducted a search. During the search, PW01 has

recovered a pink coloured cellophane bag from the individuals

possession. The cellophane bag has contained a powdered

substance which PW01 has identified as a heroin mixed powder

based on its colour, smell and texture, after verifying the

individuals identity to be that of the appellant, PW01 has arrested

him. Although the officers have thereafter searched the appellants

house, nothing illegal has been found on the premises. The officers

along with the appellant have then proceeded to the bureau.

07. At the bureau, the heroin mixed powdered substance has been

weighed and subsequently sealed as described by the witnesses

PW01 and PW03. The sealed powdered substance thereafter placed

in an envelope, which has also been securely sealed. The sealed

envelope has then been registered in the Police Property Receipt

Book bearing property receipt no.150/2013 and handed over to the

officer in charge of the productions i.e. PW02, IP Rajakaruna.

Meanwhile the appellant has been handed over to the officer-in-

charge of the reserve at the bureau.

08. PW02 has subsequently handed over the sealed envelope

containing the cellophane bag with the heroin mixed powdered

substance, to the Government Analyst for analysis. The

Government Analysts has done the necessary tests and determined

that the pure quantity of the heroin mixed with the powdered

substance was 03.35 grams. The Analysts Report has been

submitted and is marked as -9.

Case of the appellant

09. The appellant contends that he was arrested without just cause

and has been falsely implicated in the charges against him.

Grounds of appeal

10. When the matter was taken up for argument, the Learned

Counsel for the appellant urged the following grounds of appeal;

i. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to take into

consideration, serious contradictory position taken up by

the prosecution witnesses.

ii. The prosecution has failed to prove the chain of production

beyond a reasonable doubt.

iii. The Learned High Court Judge has rejected the evidence of

the defence on unreasonable grounds.

Page 6 of 11

11. The Learned Counsel has raised concerns regarding a discrepancy

between the location of the alleged arrest and the site where the

appellant was to purportedly arrive at, to peddle a narcotic

substance as indicated by PW01 based on the information from his

informant.

12. At approximately, 13.15 hours, on May 08,2013, PW01 has

received the pertinent information regarding the forthcoming event.

The informant has also indicated that he was located at the

Ibbanwela Junction.

13. Following this information, PW01 accompanied by a team of

officers have travelled to the Ibbanwela Junction to meet the

informant. Upon arrival, PW01 has engaged with the informant who

has provided a briefing that reiterated the details shared in the

previous communication. The informant has said that the

individual informed of was expected to arrive at the vicinity of the

Town Hall, near the Odel Shopping Mall.

14. Subsequently, PW01 along with PW03 and the informant have

proceeded on foot towards a designated location close to the Odel

Shopping Mall. It was at this site that the arrest has been ultimately

executed.

15. The narrative above is consistent regarding both the location

where PW01 met the informant and the site of the arrest. Notably,

at no point has it been indicated that the appellant was anticipated

to arrive at the Ibbanwella Junction with the intention of

Page 7 of 11

peddling the narcotic substance. Therefore, any concerns regarding

this matter lack merit and should be disregarded.

16. The appellant has been searched and subsequently arrested on

the pavement adjacent to the 120/138 Bus Routes which services

destinations such as Kesbawa, Horana, Maharagama, Homagama

and extends further to Avissawella. On one side of the road close

to the Odel Shopping Mall stands the National Hospital of Sri Lanka,

including the eye hospital while on the other side, features of side

entrances to the Town Hall accessible when one crosses the road.

This area experiences heavy foot traffic particularly during the day

time. It can be inferred that similar crowded conditions existed on

the date of the appellants arrest.

17. Given those circumstances, the officers could have approached

the appellant while manoeuvring through the individuals standing

nearby, either in front or behind the appellant. Such an approach

could potentially lead to confusion for witnesses PW01 and PW03

regarding the direction from which each officer approach the

appellant. This Court acknowledges this aspect especially in the

light of the appellants claim of discrepancies regarding the manner

in which the officers approached the appellant prior to his arrest.

18. In his narrative PW01 has stated that he handed over the sealed

envelope containing the cellophane bag in which the heroin mixed

powdered substance was in to PW02, i.e IP Rajakaruna who was

the officer in charge of the productions at the bureau on May 09,

2013; until that time PW01 has kept the sealed envelope securely

Page 8 of 11

stored in his locker. PW02 has confirmed receiving this envelope on

May 09,2013. Meanwhile, PW03 has corroborated the fact that

PW01 handed over the sealed envelope to PW02. However, he has

not specified the exact date of this transfer.

19. The appellants Counsel argued that the nature of questioning

PW03 creates an inference suggesting that PW03 implied the

handing over occurred on May 08,2013. This assertion raises a

potential discrepancy regarding the timeline of the envelopes

journey as a piece of evidence.

[vide page 107 of the Brief]

20. The pertinent portion of testimony relevant to this matter being as

reproduced above reveal the following:

Page 9 of 11

Although PW03 affirmed that PW01 handed the sealed

envelope to PW02, he has failed to provide a specific time

or date for this event.

PW03 maintain that the envelope was handed over to

PW02 upon it being sealed.

Given these circumstances, this Court concludes that

no discrepancies exist in the timeline of the envelopes

inward journey, despite the assertions made by the

Counsel for the appellant.

21. The appellant has provided a dock statement. In his brief

narrative, he has described an incident in which a team of police

officers raided his home. During the raid the officers have

confronted the appellant and demanded that he surrender the

narcotic substance which they claimed was in his possession.

When the appellant denied the allegations, he has been taken into

custody and falsely implicated in the matter. The appellant has not

revealed a fact about being assaulted by the officers who

purportedly raided his home.

22. Thereafter, the appellants wife has recounted the events in her

narrative stating that the officers who conducted the raid

mercilessly assaulted the appellant in the upstairs area of their

home. As a result of this brutal treatment, the appellant became

Page 10 of 11

disoriented, he thereafter vomited in the seating area, and the

witness has reported that she forced the appellant to drink hot

water.

23. During the cross examination of PW03 a significant question has

been posed regarding the arrest of an individual named Gamini

(vide page 11 in the proceedings dated June 05,2017, beginning at

11.50 am at page 124 of the Brief).

It has been asserted that Gamini was taken into custody at the

appellants home. The cross-examination highlights a crucial point;

despite the arrest of the individual named Gamini, no narcotic

substance was recovered in the search. Furthermore, it has been

alleged that subsequently the appellant was assaulted by the

officers who conducted the search.

24. This line of questioning unveils substantial discrepancies

presented on behalf of the appellant. The contradictions that arise

from this testimony had not been adequately clarified, highlighting

a lack of consistency that undermines the credibility of the

appellants case. Such discrepancies are not merely peripheral

issues; they strike at the very core of the appellants arguments.

Without a satisfactory explanation for these discrepancies, the

appellants claims are significantly weakened, raising serious

questions about the reliability of the evidence provided in his

defence.

25. Due to the aforesaid reasons I am not inclined to interfere with

the disputed judgment together with the sentencing order.

26. I proceed to dismiss the appeal and make no order regarding

costs.

Appeal dismissed.

27. I direct the Registrar of this Court to send the judgment to the

High Court of Colombo for compliance
