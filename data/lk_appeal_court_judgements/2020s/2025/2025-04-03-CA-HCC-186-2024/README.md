JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused- Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted in

the High Courts of Colombo for having being in possession and trafficking of 1.58g

of Heroin on 23.08.2016, at Stasepura under Section 54A (b) and (d) of the Poisons,

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance No. 13 of 1984 as amended.

After the Accused pleaded not guilty, the Prosecution led evidence through 13

witnesses and marked 7 productions. The Accused gave a statement under oath.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned Judge of the High Court by judgment

dated 09.02.2024 found the Accused guilty of the 1st Count and sentenced to 7

years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 100,000/- in default one year of

rigorous imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the Accused has preferred

the present appeal to this Court.

The following are the grounds of appeal as urged by the Accused;

1. The High Court has failed to consider the contradictions in the prosecution

witnesses.

2. The High Court has not taken into consideration the defence

3. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the weaknesses and

the incredibility of the prosecution witnesses.

4. The judgment was delivered in contravention of the evidence placed before

the Court.

According to the testimony of PW7, Police Officer Chammika, on 23.08.2016 when

he with other officers were walking around 6.00 PM, near a littered area, the

Accused was there. Upon seeing the witnesses, the Accused went towards the

housing scheme, and the witnesses walked fast and stopped the Accused by

holding his hand asking for reasons for such behaviour. The Accused had not

responded and thereafter, the witness had checked the pockets of the Accused and

found a small parcel wrapped in a pink cellophane bag. The witness had arrested

the Accused at 6.30 PM after identifying it to be heroin. Thereafter, at 6.45 PM

the witness was handcuffed and taken to Lechchami Jewellers at Kosgas Junction.

The heroin alone weighed around 3400mg then was tied with a knot that was

sealed and stamped. They left the said place around 7.40 PM and reached the

Grandpass Police at 8.15 PM.

This Court notes that the Counsel for the Accused challenged the sentence

imposed on the Accused by the High Court on the basis of no previous convictions,

Page 4 of 8

the young age of the Accused and that the Accused has several minor children, the

youngest being only 6 months old.

Our Courts have considered that when the Learned Trial Judge considers the

mitigatory and aggravating factors, there is a duty cast on the Judge to give a

reasonable consideration to such factors.

In Archbold: Sentencing Guidelines (2019), Thomson Reuters, on page 274, under

the heading of applicability of guidelines on sexual offences, it is stated that;

Starting points define the position within a category range from which to

start calculating the provisional sentence.

Once the starting point is established, the court should consider further

aggravating and mitigating factors and previous convictions so as to adjust

the sentence within the range. Starting points and ranges apply to all

offenders, whether they have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trial.

In this context, since the Counsel for the Accused sought a mitigatory sentence, I

am mindful of the sentiments expressed by His Lordship Basnayake ACJ in The

Attorney General v. H.N. De Silva 57 NLR 121 at page 124 in the matter of

assessing the sentence to be imposed for an offence.

In assessing the punishment that should be passed on an offender, a Judge

should consider the matter of sentence both from the point of view of the

public and the offender. Judges are too often prone to look at the question

only from the angle of the offender. A Judge should, in determining the

Page 5 of 8

proper sentence, first consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from

the nature of the act itself and should have regard to the punishment

provided in the Penal Code or other statute under which the offender is

charged. He should also regard the effect of the punishment as a deterrent

and consider to what extent it will be effective. If the offender held a position

of trust or belonged to a service which enjoys the public confidence that

must be taken into account in assessing the punishment. The incidence of

crimes of the nature of which the offender has been found to be guilty [Rex

v. Boyd (1908) 1 Cr. App. Rep. 64.] and the difficulty of detection are also

matters which should receive due consideration. The reformation of the

criminal, though no doubt an important consideration, is subordinate to the

others I have mentioned. Where the public interest or the welfare of the

State (which are synonymous) outweighs the previous good character,

antecedents and age of the offender, public interest must prevail.

This dictum was followed by His Lordship Gunasekara J in The Attorney General

v. Mendis 1995 1 SLR 138 and held that;

In our view once an accused is found guilty and convicted on his own plea,

or after trial, the Trial Judge has a difficult function to perform. That is to

decide what sentence is to be imposed on the accused who has been

convicted. In doing so he has to consider the point of view of the accused on

the one hand and the interest of society on the other. In doing so the Judge

must necessarily consider the nature of the offence committed, the manner

in which it has been committed the machinations and the manipulations

resorted to by the accused to commit the offence, the effect of committing

Page 6 of 8

such a crime insofar as the institution or organisation in respect of which it

has been committed, the persons who are affected by such crime, the

ingenuity with which it has been committed and the involvement of others

in committing the crime. The Trial Judge who has the sole discretion in

imposing a sentence which is appropriate having regard to the criteria set

out above should in our view not to surrender this sacred right and duty to

any other person, be it counsel or accused or any other person. Whilst plea

bargaining is permissible in our view, sentence bargaining should not be

encouraged at all and must be frowned upon.

Further held that;

We are in agreement with the observations of Basnayake, A.C.J. that

whilst "the reformation of the criminal though no doubt is an important

consideration in assessing the punishment that should be passed on an

offender, where the public interest or the welfare of the state outweighs the

previous good character, antecedents and age of the offender, that public

interest must prevail." Having regard to the manner and the ingenuity with

which the crimes that the Accused-Respondent has committed to which he

has pleaded guilty, we are of the view that the sentence imposed is grossly

inadequate. In our view the crimes to which the Accused-Respondent

pleaded guilty are of a very serious nature and have been committed with

much planning, deliberation and manipulation and called for an immediate

custodial sentence.

With the above dictums in mind, we consider the present appeal regarding

mitigation of the sentencing.

Column II of Part III of the Third Schedule to the said Act as amended sets out

the quantity of heroin and the penalty is set out in the corresponding entry in

Column III. On a plain reading of the wording in Part III, it is clear that the for

possession of heroin of 2g or below, the penalty as set out in the corresponding

entry in Column III is Fine not less than one hundred thousand rupees and not

exceeding five hundred thousand rupees and imprisonment of either description

for a period not less than seven years and not exceeding twenty years.

The Legislature has specified the maximum and minimum terms of imprisonment

for the said offence. That is to stay, the Court is vested with the discretion with

the specified limits. The Learned High Court Judge has imposed the minimum

sentence on the Accused. In other words, the Court has given a lenient sentence

to the Accused.

We observe that when the Trial Judge imposed the sentence, has taken into

consideration the following;

Therefore, we hold that the Learned Judge has correctly come to the conclusion by

imposing the minimum mandatory sentence by taking into consideration the

mitigatory facts submitted by the Accused and the offence he is charged with.

For the above-mentioned reasons, we see no reason to intervene with the sentence

imposed on the Accused by the Learned High Court Judge on 09.02.2024.
