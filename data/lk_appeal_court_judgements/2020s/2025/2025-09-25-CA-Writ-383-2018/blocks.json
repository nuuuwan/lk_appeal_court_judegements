Considering the circumstances of this case the only reasonable conclusion that can be reached is that the Petitioner is deliberately suppressing material facts. As emphasised in Namunukula Plantations Ltd. v.

The Petitioner in the instant case, had not met that standard and has contributed to the very situation of which it now complains.
