The Petitioners have obtained route permits to operate a regular passenger service on Route No. 441 from Matugama to Aluthgama and from Aluthgama to Matugama (P1 - P12). The parties are not at variance that the 3rd Respondent is the Authority that is empowered to issue route permits. The Petitioners allege that the 3rd and 4th Respondents have called for tenders to grant route permits for two buses to ply on the Route No. 441 Aluthgama Matugama (P17). As per P15 and P16 it is evident that there are 11 buses operating from the Aluthgama end while 13 buses operate daily from the Matugama end. It is contended that while all 11 buses that commence its journey from the Aluthgama end has to operate the entire week without a break. Hence, it is not in dispute that the buses plying the Aluthgama to Matugama end have no rest day. For buses that operate on the Matugama end, one bus is kept on standby per week. Hence, the argument that calling for tenders to issue two more route permits for the Aluthgama end would result in two buses being kept on standby every week.",

    "text": "The Respondents also submitted that in coming to the decision to call for new tenders they have considered the need to have a healthy transport service with buses in a mechanically perfect condition. As per the documents marked as 3R1, P15 and P16, it is evident that though there are 13 buses plying from Matugama to Aluthgama, there are only 11 buses from Aluthgama to Matugama. Thus, there is an imbalance. Further, it is argued that since the buses are carrying passengers, the said buses should be regularly maintained and there should be regular mechanical inspections. It was also submitted that the drivers for the buses should be given adequate rest. It was also contended by the Respondents that they expect the Petitioners to carry out regular maintenance of the buses and provide a rest day for the crew. However, though the Muthugama end has 2 buses on standby every week it is not so on the Althugama end as there are only 11 buses. The said buses have to operate on all 7 days of the week. Which the Respondents contended is not a healthy situation as there are no dates available for the said buses to be sent in for maintenance. Hence, they argued that tenders were called to add two new buses to make the number of buses from Aluthgama end to the Matugama end becomes equal. It is their contention that then an undisrupted transport service can be maintained as there will be 2 buses on standby and the said standby buses can be subjected to a mechanical inspection at least once a week. It was also argued that in the absence of such standby buses, if there is a sudden emergency or breakdown there is no replacement bus to operate on the Aluthgama end. Hence, the transport timetable will be disrupted and the greater public will have to undergo numerous difficulties. In my view, this is what is attempted to be avoided by inserting 6(1)() in the Provincial Statute. It is also observed that considering the documents marked 3R1, 3R2 3R3, P15 and P16 this Court is inclined to accept the submissions of the learned Counsel appearing for the Respondents.",
