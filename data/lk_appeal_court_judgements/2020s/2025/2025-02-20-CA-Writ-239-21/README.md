This matter was supported on 21.07.2022 and based on the pleadings

and the circumstances of this case, this Court was inclined to issue

notice on the Respondents. However, the learned Counsel for the

Respondents agreed to accept notices on behalf of the Respondents.

On 13.09.2023 the Counsel for the Respondents informed Court that the

1st Respondent has ceased to hold office. As such, 3rd Respondent was

added to the Application on 03.12.2024.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows;

The Petitioners Ceylon Financial Association of Seventh-Day Adventists

became the owner of the land by a deed of transfer bearing No. 307

attested by N. Y. Kunaseelan.

On 02.11.2011, almost a year subsequent to the 1st Petitioner

commencing the conducting of services at Pitabeddera, the Divisional

Secretariat of Pitabeddera informed the 1st Petitioner about the objection

raised by the Shasanarakshaka Management Board and the residents of

the area against the religious activities by the Seventh Day Adventist

Church. The letter further stated that it is illegal to maintain a religious

place without the approval of the Ministry of Buddhasasana and

Religious Affairs.

CA-Writ / 0239-2021

As such, the Petitioners had made an application to the Pitabeddara

Pradeshiya Sabha dated 16.01.2013 seeking permission to build or

maintain a new place of worship. This request was turned down by the

Pitabeddara Pradeshiya Sabha.

Against the refusal, the 1st Petitioner had filed a Writ Application No.CA

(Writ) 159/2016 challenging the said decision of the Divisional Secretary

of Pitabeddara on 17.05. 2016. But this application was dismissed by the

Court of Appeal on 13.06.2016. As this was suppressed by the 1st

Petitioner, the Respondents submit that the Petitioners had not come

before this Court with clean hands and therefore, cannot invoke the Writ

Jurisdiction of this Court.

The suppression of material facts to the court means intentionally

withholding or concealing important information that is relevant to a

legal proceeding. Such actions can significantly impact the fairness of a

trial, as they may prevent one party from having all the facts necessary

to present their case or defend against allegations.

In short, suppression of material facts is a serious violation of legal

principles that can undermine the integrity of the justice system. Courts

take such actions seriously, as they directly affect the ability to reach fair

and just outcomes in legal cases.

Alponso Appuhamy v Hettiarachchi 77 NLR 131 the Court held that:

When an application for a prerogative writ or an injunction is made,

it is the duty of the petitioner to place before the Court, before it

issues notice in the first instance, a full and truthful disclosure of all

the material facts; the petitioner must act with uberrima fides.

CA-Writ / 0239-2021

Walkers Sons & Company Ltd. v Wijesena [1997] 1 SLR 293 the Court

held that;

It is now settled that a person who makes an ex parte application

is under an obligation to make the fullest possible disclosure of all

the material facts and that if he does not make the fullest possible

disclosure, then he cannot obtain any advantage which may have

already have been obtained by him.

"A party cannot plead that the misrepresentation was due to

inadvertence or misinformation or that the Applicants was not aware

of the importance of certain facts which he omitted to place before

court."

Since the Courts rely on the information provided by the parties, the duty

of full disclosure is of great importance in legal proceedings, especially in

writ petitions. Here the Courts rely heavily on the information provided

in order to arrive at a fair and informed decision. Therefore, if a party

withholds or misrepresents material or relevant facts, it can lead to an

incomplete or inaccurate understanding of the case which will in turn

will result in an unjust or unfair judgment.

The Petitioners seek direct judicial intervention through application of

writ petitions. The Courts role here is to deliberate whether that the

public authority concerned has acted within its authority. Therefore, the

full disclosure of material facts is of utmost importance to the proper

deliberation of the case. Access to proper facts material to the case is

ensures that the courts are properly able to assess whether the relief

sought is justified based on the law.

Courts discourage the suppression of material facts which not only

misleads the court but also undermines the integrity of the judicial

process and compromises their ability to arrive at just and equitable

decisions. It will also inevitably lead to serious consequences including

CA-Writ / 0239-2021

8 | P a g e

dismissal of the petition, adverse inferences, and even potential legal

penalties.

The principle is based on the notion that justice must not only be done

but must seem to be done. It ensures that the court has all the necessary

information to render a fair judgment.

As the application of the Petitioners is devoid of merit, this Court decided

to dismiss this application. No costs ordered.
