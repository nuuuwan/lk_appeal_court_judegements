No.22 of 1995.

Charge 02

Code as amended by Act No.22 of 1995.

Charge 03

That during the same period and same place as mentioned

364(A)(1) of the Penal Code as amended by Act No.22 of 1995.

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge has

convicted the appellant of the 1st charge and has sentenced the

appellant as follows;

A term of 18 years rigorous imprisonment and also imposed

a fine of Rs. 25,000 with a term of 06 months in default.

4. The appellant has been acquitted of the 2nd and 3rd charges. The

appellant aggrieved by the conviction and the disputed judgment

Page 4 of 14

together with the sentencing order has preferred the instant appeal to

this Court.

Case of the prosecution

5. PW01 has maintained that her mother, i.e. DW04, had an illicit affair

with the appellant while she was still married to PW01s biological

father. This revelation has reportedly caused great distress,

culminating in the tragic suicide of PW01s biological father upon

discovering the affair.

6. Following the death of her husband, PW01s mother [DW04], has

married the appellant. Initially, DW04, the appellant and DW04s

children from her previous marriage have lived together in the house

of DW04s sister. After sometime, they have moved into a separate

residence where PW01 occupied her own home.

7. One morning in 2014, at approximately 04.00 am, while PW01 was in

her room, the appellant has entered the room and allegedly engaged

in sexual intercourse with PW01 against her will. PW01 has stated that

this was the only incident of such nature involving the appellant. At

the time of the incident, PW01 has not informed the third party about

it.

8. In 2016, the Grama Niladari of the area has visited PW01s household

and is said to have inquired about the incident involving the appellant.

Following this, the Grama Niladari has decided to make a formal

complaint to the Police. As a result, necessary investigations

Page 5 of 14

have been initiated and a statement of PW01 recorded. Subsequently,

PW01 has been examined by a Judicial Medical Officer, i.e. PW08, Dr.

S. Amararathne, and the medico-legal report compiled by PW08

marked -2.

Case of the appellant

9. The appellant has consistently asserted that PW01 was engaged in an

affair with a young man named Ramesh. It is the appellants position

that, after he and DW01, brought this affair to light, PW01, along with

the relatives of her biological father and PW02, i.e. the Grama Niladhari

of the area conspired to fabricate accusations against the appellant

regarding the incident outlined in the charges.

Grounds of appeal

10. When the matter was taken up for argument, the Learned Counsel of

the appellant urged the following grounds of appeal;

i. Evidence of the prosecution witnesses, fails the test of

credibility and the test of consistency.

ii. The Learned High Court Judge has rejected the evidence

of the defence on unreasonable grounds.

11. PW01s account states that when she, her mother, her siblings, and

the appellant moved into their new residence, the appellant allegedly

engaged in sexual intercourse with her one day in 2014 at around 04.00

am in the room, where the former was sleeping in. During the course of

Page 6 of 14

the cross-examination, she has confirmed that this incident has

occurred only once, emphasising that the specific incident she referred

to was the only time the appellant engaged in sexual intercourse with

her.

Evidence of proceedings from the cross-examination of the appellant;

[vide page 91 of the Brief]

12. Prior to her testimony in Court, PW01 has provided a detailed account

of the incident/incidents in the form of a short history given by a

patient. PW08, the Judicial Medical Officer who examined her has

recorded this account in writing. In her narrative to the doctor, PW01

has stated that the appellant had engaged in sexual intercourse with

her on several occasions, the last of which had purportedly occurred

three weeks prior to her examination in 2016. Additionally, she has

reported that the appellant had engaged in sexual activity involving the

insertion of his penis into her rectum and her mouth. PW01 has further

Page 12 of 14

alleged that these acts occurred after she returned home from school in

the afternoon.

13. Following the examination, PW08, Dr. S Amararathne has concluded

that there were indications of sexual abuse consistent with the

information detailed in PW01s patient history. PW08 has testified to

substantiating such fact and confirmed that he recorded the brief

history provided by PW01, the patient, as documented in the medico-

legal report marked -2.

14. The discrepancies between the testimony and the account documented

in the patients history are strikingly evident. These discrepancies

pertain to several critical aspects;

- The nature of the alleged sexual abuse,

- the number of times PW01 claims to have been subject to such

abuse by the appellant,

- and, the time of the day when these incidents reportedly

occurred.

15. Remarkably, the discrepancies in these accounts have not been

satisfactorily explained. It is essential to recognise that the age of

PW01, as well as the time lapse between the events and the statement

provided to the investigators along with the timeline of the testimony

given in Court do not adequately justify these striking inconsistencies.

Testimony regarding such traumatic experiences should in theory

maintain a certain level of coherence. Given the extraordinary nature of

the experiences described, these obvious lapses in detail cannot be

dismissed as mere coincidences or typical errors.

Page 13 of 14

16. The unaddressed discrepancies raised substantial concerns about the

reliability of PW01s testimony. It is important to consider such fact

carefully in order to ensure a fair assessment of the prosecutions case.

17. In a criminal case, it is the prosecutions duty to prove its case beyond a

reasonable doubt. This high standard of proof is a fundamental principle

of the justice system, designed to protect the accused from wrongful

conviction and endure that only those who are truly guilty are punished.

When the prosecution fails to present sufficient evidence to meet this

standard, the benefit of the doubt must be afforded to the accused.

18. In the present case, the prosecution has not successfully fulfilled its

obligation. The evidence presented through PW01, lacks the necessary

weight and credibility required to establish guilt beyond a reasonable

doubt. This shortfall undermines the integrity of the prosecutions case.

19. Furthermore, a thorough examination of the evidence, or the lack of it,

reveals striking gaps and inconsistencies that further weaken the

prosecutions argument. Such shortcomings warrant a reconsideration

of the case emphasising the need for caution before reaching a verdict

that could irreparably impact the life of the appellant. Due to the

prosecutions failure to provide compelling evidence that meets the

standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt it is only just and

reasonable to decide in favour of the appellant.

20. The facts being so, the necessity does not arise to determine the 2nd

ground of appeal urged by the appellant.

21. Due to the reasons set out above, I am inclined to interfere with the

conviction and the disputed judgment together with the sentencing order.

I set aside the conviction, the disputed judgment and the sentencing

order. I acquit the appellant of the charge convicted of.

Appeal allowed.

I make no order regarding costs.

22. I direct the Registrar of this Court to send a copy of this judgment to

the High Court of Puttalam for necessary compliance.
