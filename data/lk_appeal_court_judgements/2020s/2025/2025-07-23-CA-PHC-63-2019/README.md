JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. This is an appeal forwarded by the Registered-Owner-Claimant-

Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) who is aggrieved by the judgment pronounced by the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo in case number HCRA 55/2018.

2. The Learned High Court Judge of Colombo by his judgment dated June

10,2019 has affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate of Colombo in Magistrates Court case no. 41754/2/15 dated April 06, 2018. The order of the Learned Magistrate has been pronounced consequent to an inquiry conducted in terms of section 431(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 in relation to vehicle bearing registration no. WP PD 9399 and the said vehicle has been temporarily released to the 3rd respondent-respondent named in the instant petition of appeal. 3. When the matter was taken up for argument, this Court heard the

submissions of the Learned Presidents Counsel who appeared on behalf of the appellant, the submissions of the Learned Counsel who appeared on behalf of the 3rd respondent-respondent, also the submissions of the Learned State Counsel who appeared on behalf of the 4th respondent-respondent and the 5th respondent-respondent. 4. The 1st respondent-respondent named in the instant petition of appeal,

i.e., the Officer-in-Charge of the Borella Police has filed a B report in the Magistrates Court of Colombo on June 30, 2015 to report facts to Court regarding a complaint made to the Borella Police by the 3rd respondent-respondent. 5. The 1st respondent-respondent as stated above has received a

complaint from the 3rd respondent-respondent regarding the latters purchase of a vehicle from the 2nd respondent-respondent. The issue at

Page 6 of 10

hand had been that the 2nd respondent-respondent had not handed over to the former the documents necessary for registering the vehicle purchased in the name of the 3rd respondent-respondent. 6. Based on this complaint, the 1st respondent-respondent has reported

facts of a commission of an offence to the Magistrates Court of Colombo. In the report, the 1st respondent-respondent has alleged that the 2nd respondent-respondent has committed an offence punishable under section 389 of the Penal Code.

7. Subsequently, the Learned Magistrate has proceeded to frame a charge

against the 2nd respondent-respondent, who has pleaded not guilty to the charge of committing an offence punishable under section 389 of the Penal Code. 8. As the trial progressed, the Learned Magistrate has come to a finding

that the investigation has not been conducted properly. Consequently, the Learned Magistrate has ordered that the vehicle bearing registration number WP PD 9399 be seized and presented in Court.

9. The 1st respondent-respondent has complied with the order.

Furthermore, the Learned Magistrate has decided to conduct an inquiry concerning the seized vehicle as stipulated in section 431(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979. 10. At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Learned Magistrate has decided as

follows;

i. To amend the charge in the charge sheet in which the 2nd respondent-respondent had been named an accused, to reflect an offence punishable under section 400 of the Penal Code.

Page 7 of 10

ii. To temporarily deliver possession of the vehicle bearing registration number WP PD 9399 to the 3rd respondent-respondent.

iii. To issue incidental orders to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, enabling the 3rd respondent-respondent to use the vehicle in question while its in its position.

11. The appellant aggrieved by the order of the Magistrate dated April 06,

2018 has forwarded an application for revision to the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo, seeking to have the impugned order revised. After the matter was argued in that Court, the Learned High Court Judge has affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate.

12. Dissatisfied with the decision of the Learned High Court Judge dated

June 10, 2019, the appellant has now preferred the present appeal to this Court.

Statement of uncontested facts;

i. It is undisputed that the appellant sold a Toyota Fortuner

vehicle to a company known as Gold Medal Consortium (Pvt) Ltd, in exchange the appellant has received a total consideration of Rs.3.5 Million in cash along with a cheque for Rs. 1.2 Milllion and the vehicle in question, which bears registration number WP PD 9399. ii. Although the necessary documents for the registration of

the vehicle bearing registration number WP PD 9399 were handed over to the appellant, in that instance, those documents were not submitted to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles in a timely manner.

iii. The appellant subsequently provided the vehicle bearing

registration number WP PD 9399 to the 2nd respondent-

Page 8 of 10

respondent entrusting him with the responsibility of selling the particular vehicle to a third party. iv. The 3rd respondent-respondent subsequently purchased

the vehicle bearing registration number WP PD 9399 from the 2nd respondent-respondent for a sum of Rs. 3.875 Million. v. Though the possession of the vehicle was handed over to

the 3rd respondent-respondent on April 23, 2015 upon such purchase, the essential documents required for registering the vehicle in the name of 3rd respondent-respondent were not provided by the 2nd respondent-respondent.

vi. After exhausting all attempts to obtain the documents for

registration from the 2nd respondent-respondent, the 3rd respondent-respondent filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Colombo bearing case number DSP 104/2016.

Seeking a declaration that the 3rd respondent-respondent was the legitimate owner of the vehicle bearing registration number WP PD 9399. vii. In response, the District Court has issued an interim order

prohibiting the appellant from transferring ownership of the vehicle bearing registration number WP PD 9399 to any other party. viii. It is noteworthy that the vehicle bearing registration

number WP PD 9399 was in the possession of the 3rd respondent-respondent, at the time the appellant submitted the documents relevant to registration to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles in an effort to have the vehicle registered in its name.

Page 9 of 10

13. The uncontested facts indicate that the appellant entrusted the sale of

the vehicle bearing registration number WP PD 9399 to the 2nd respondent-respondent. The 2nd respondent-respondent has thereafter sold the vehicle to the 3rd respondent-respondent on April 23, 2015, who also took possession of it on the same day. Therefore, a bonafide purchaser. However, the vehicle has been registered in the name of the appellant on September 30, 2015, despite the fact that the appellant had not been in possession of the vehicle since April; it had remained with the 3rd respondent-respondent during that time. 14. In light of these circumstances, the registration of the vehicle bearing

registration number WP PD 9399, in the name of the appellant is irregular as established in the case of Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka vs. Mano Chanmugam SC Appeal 157/97 2000 BLR 21, where it was held as follows;

we note that under the Motor Traffic Act the transferee should at first have possession of the car and only then an application should be made for the registration in his name of that car. The forms M.T.A. 8 and M.T.A.6 that have been produced clearly reflect the legal position as stated in section 2 onwards of part 1 of the Motor Traffic Act that what is registered is the change of possession upon a transfer of a motor vehicle. In this instance the bank never had possession of the car, but purported to secure a registration and a transfer in its favour. In fact, the bank had only a distinctive number of a motor vehicle without having possession of a motor vehicle

Hence the purported registration does not give any right to the bank as contemplated in section 431(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure to obtain an order in its favour.

15. Accordingly, in a situation where it is necessary to determine who is

entitled to possession, it is appropriate to conclude that the 3rd respondent-respondent, as a bona fide purchaser in possession of the vehicle in question is indeed entitled to retain possession of it.

Page 10 of 10

16. Further, as regards to the incidental orders made by the Learned High

Court Judge such orders have been made to enable the 3rd respondent-respondent to use the vehicle in question when it is in the possession of the 3rd respondent-respondent and to comply with the provisions of section 2 of the Motor Traffic Act read with section 9(3) of the same legislation. Such incidental orders are legal and not perverse.

17. In those circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere with the

impugned judgement of the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo

18. Hence, I dismiss the appeal and make no order regarding costs.

Appeal dismissed. 19. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the Magistrates Court of Colombo for compliance/information.
