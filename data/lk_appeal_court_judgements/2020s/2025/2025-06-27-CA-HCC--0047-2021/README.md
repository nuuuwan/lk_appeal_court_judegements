JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo under Sections 54(A) (b) and 54(A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for the

trafficking and possession of 2.18 grams of Heroin (diacetylmorphine) on 11th

March 2015.

Following the conclusion of the trial, the Appellant was found guilty only

under the second count and the learned High Court Judge of Colombo

sentenced him to life imprisonment on 06/08/2021.

CA/HCC/47/21

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given his consent to argue this matter in his absence. At the hearing,

the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform from prison.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. Whether the prosecution proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt.

Background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

In this case, the Appellant was arrested by the Prison Officers attached to

the Welikada Prison. According to PW4 - Prison Officer Bernard, he was given

instructions by the Chief Jailor to search Ward A3, Room No.49 of the

Welikada Prison. He had checked four prisoners inside Room No.49. During

the search, a pink-coloured cellophane cover was recovered from the

Appellants waist. When PW4 opened the parcel, he had found 19 white

coloured cellophane covers with substances suspected to be Heroin inside

them. As per instructions, PW4 had sealed and handed them over to Jailor

Upul Chaminda at the Disciplinary Section. Although the Police Narcotics

Bureau was informed on the date of detection, the officers from the Police

Narcotics Bureau arrived at the prison only on 04.01.2021. They had

arrested the Appellant and escorted him to the Police Narcotics Bureau.

The Appellant had given evidence from the witness box and had taken up

the position that he was never in possession of Heroin and the Heroin

recovered from another person was planted on him by the Prison Officer. He

claims that the Prisons Officers were hostile towards him as he had recently

conducted a hunger strike in the prison. The Appellant was a serving

prisoner at the time of the detection.

CA/HCC/47/21

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond a reasonable doubt against the accused person and this burden only

shifts in specific circumstances. Hence an accused person has no burden to

prove his case unless he pleads a general or a special exception given under

the Penal Code.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are

of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions.

In the Attorney-General v. Rawther 25 NLR 385, Ennis, J. states thus:

[1987} 1 SLR 155

"The evidence must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence.

His innocence is presumed in law, from the start of the case, and his

guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:

the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required in

a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree is

well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree of

probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond

the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it

admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the

evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility

in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence, of course it is

CA/HCC/47/21

5 | P a g e

possible, but not in the least probable, the case is proved beyond

reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.

The role of probability is pivotal in persuading the judge on specific points,

as higher probabilities increase the likelihood of the judge being convinced.

Therefore, probability plays a crucial role in criminal investigations, aiding

in the evaluation of the relevance of different types of evidence. In order to

accuse someone "beyond reasonable doubt," it is essential to possess

substantial evidence. To achieve this, certain assumptions must be made to

draw conclusions. The likelihood of these assumptions being accurate is

precisely termed the principle of probability in legal contexts.

Weighing is one of the first steps in an investigation process and has a strong

bearing on the final results. In this case the detection was done by a prison

officer. According to his evidence after the detection he had simply sealed the

contraband without weighing it. This is significant, as the investigation team

from the Police Narcotics Bureau had only arrived at the Prison premises on

04.01.2011, five days after the said detection took place. According to PW4,

usually, officers from the Narcotics Bureau arrive at least two days following

the detection.

In all drug related investigations, the first step taken by the investigation

agency after the detection of suspected drugs is to weigh the substance

recovered from the suspect. As stated above this is not only a fundamental

step but also a very crucial step. The accuracy and the integrity of the

production need to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Contradictions, inter se or per se can affect the outcome of a case gravely.

CA/HCC/47/21

In the case of AG v. Sandanam Pitchai Mary Theresa (2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292

the court held that:

Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect

the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that

the Court must exercise its judgment on the nature of the inconsistency

or contradiction and should consider whether they are material to the

fact in issue.

In the case of K. Padmathilaka alias Sergeant Elpitiya v. The Director

General of Commission to Investigate Allegation of Bribery and

Corruption [2010] BLR 67 the court held that:

Credibility of prosecution witnesses should be subject to judicial

evaluation in totality and not isolated scrutiny by the judge. When witness

makes an inconsistent statement in their evidence either at one stage or

two stages, the testimony of such witness is unreliableIt is a cardinal

principle that unreliable evidence cannot be rendered credible, simply

because there is some corroboration material.

According to PW4, he was only involved in the raid and subsequently, in the

sealing of the productions. He had categorically stated that he did not get

involved in any of the activities that followed. But a contradictory position

was taken by PW1 who had come from the Police Narcotics Bureau.

According to him the production was weighed by PW4 and PW5 on the 4th of

January. As argued by the Counsel for the Appellant this raises a significant

doubt regarding the prosecutions case.

According to PW4, the raid was conducted on 29th December 2011 and the

officers from the Narcotics Bureau came to the Welikada Prison on the

following day and recorded his statement. But according to PW1, they had

CA/HCC/47/21

7 | P a g e

only received a telephone call from Prison on 04th of January 2012 about the

apprehension of an inmate with Heroin. PW1 with PC 22363 Priyantha had

visited the prison and conducted the investigations on the same date. This

raises a very serious doubt regarding the date of detection. Considering the

circumstances of this case, the highlighted contradictions above are very

significant and sufficient to affect the core of the case.

The profound duty of the trial court is to consider the evidence placed before

it by the prosecution and the defence on equal footings to arrive at its finding.

In R v. Hepworth 1928 (AD) 265, at 277, Curlewis JA stated:

A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim the

benefit of any omission or mistake made by the other side, and a

Judge's position in a criminal trial is not merely that of an umpire to see

that the rules of the game are applied by both sides. A Judge is an

administrator of justice, not merely a figure-head, he has not only to

direct and control the proceedings according to recognised rules of

procedure but to see that justice is done.

In this case the raid was conducted by the prison officers. The substance

was not weighed at the time of sealing by PW4. Further, prosecution

witnesses had taken differing views with regard to weighing of the

production. Further, it is not clear as to when officers from the Police

Narcotics Bureau had received the information. If the Learned Trial Judge

had examined the evidence presented from the correct perspective, he would

have been inclined to accept the testimony provided by the Appellant.

As the prosecution had failed in its duty to prove this case beyond a

reasonable doubt, I hereby set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by

the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 06/08/2021 on the

Appellant. Therefore, he is acquitted from this case.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
