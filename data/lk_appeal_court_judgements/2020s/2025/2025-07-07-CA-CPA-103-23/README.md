JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The RegisteredOwnerPetitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) filed this

application on 06.09.2023, seeking to set aside the order of the High Court of Colombo

dated 16.06.2023.

According to the Petitioner, the Accused, Shivanandam Muralidaran, was indicted before

the High Court of Colombo under indictment number HC 2889/21 for the possession and

trafficking of 24.816 kilograms of Cannabis Sativa, allegedly committed on or around 2nd

May 2020, in violation of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance No. 13 of

1984, as amended.

On 7th February 2023, the Accused pleaded guilty, following which the Learned High

Court Judge convicted and sentenced him. Subsequently, notice was issued to the

Petitioner, as she had signed the bond in connection with the vehicle inquiry, which was

held on 16th June 2023.

In her testimony before the High Court, the petitioner stated that she had previously sold

the vehicle to her late brother, who had subsequently leased it to a third party prior to

the incident. She further affirmed that the vehicle had been released to her by the court

under a bond valued at five million. As she is presently unable to produce the vehicle

before the court, she agreed to pay four million in partial fulfilment of the bond obligation.

The Courts have consistently held that the remedy of revision is discretionary and will

not be exercised unless the application reveals circumstances amounting to a miscarriage

of justice.

According to the order dated 16.06.2023, the learned High Court Judge observed that the

petitioner agreed to pay four million rupees from the bond, as she was unable to produce

the vehicle.

It is noted that the petitioner had entered into an agreement before the Court,

undertaking to pay a sum of four million. However, she is now contesting the order issued

by the learned High Court Judge, which was made based on the assurance she herself

provided. In my view, this constitutes a withdrawal from the undertaking given to the

Court and amounts to a breach of contract.

The conduct of the Petitioner is a pertinent factor in the determination of this application.

Peera v. The Peoples Bank, 1995 (2) SLR 84 at page 87, G.P,S.de Silva,CJ

In any event, revision is a discretionary remedy and the conduct of the defendant is a

matter which is intensely relevant. I hold that the conduct of the defendant disentitles

him to relief by way of revision in the facts and circumstances of this case.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the petitioner is not entitled to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction of this court.

Application dismissed. I order Rs. 50,000.00 as a state cost.
