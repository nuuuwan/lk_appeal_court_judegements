JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted

before the High Court of Kurunegala on the charge of committing the offence of

murder of one Dissanayaka Arachchige Nilani Dissanayaka on 07.05.2013

punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code as amended.

The Prosecution led the evidence through twenty-five witnesses and marking

productions from P1 to P13 and thereafter closed its case. The Accused in his

defence gave evidence under oath. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High

Court Judge by judgment dated 19.12.2019 found the Accused guilty of murder

and imposed the death sentence.

Page 3 of 18

Being aggrieved by the afore-mentioned conviction and the sentence, the Accused

has preferred this appeal to this Court.

The following are the grounds of appeal as pleaded by the Accused.

1. Whether the Accused was placed in disadvantageous position by not being

tried by a jury?

2. No evidence of eye witness to show that the Accused is the perpetrator of

the said crime

3. Trial Judge erred by not considering the contradictions made by the

prosecution witnesses

4. The reports produced by the Government Analyst Department has not

stated that the fingerprints found in the productions are that of the said

Accused.

When this matter was argued on 25.03.2025, the Counsel for the Accused informed

the Court that they were not challenging the conviction and the sentence imposed.

However, there is a duty cast on this Court to consider whether the Prosecution

has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt as the Accused is facing a death

sentence.

Since the case of the prosecution is based entirely on circumstantial evidence, it is

pertinent to consider the rules governing the cases of circumstantial evidence.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, The Law of Evidence, Page 25:

In Sri Lanka, the rule that in order to justify the inference of guilt from

purely circumstantial evidence, the incriminating facts must be

incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation

Page 4 of 18

on any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt, has been

repeatedly emphasized and applied by our courts. Thus, in a case based

entirely on circumstantial evidence, the fact that the deceased was last seen

alive in the company of the deceased would not of itself justify a conviction,

where the exact time of death is not established, nor would the fact that the

accused subsequently attempted to dispose of a weapon which might have

caused the injuries on the deceased. Again, where the only evidence against

two accused, indicted for murder, was that they had the opportunity of

committing the offence either jointly or individually and that after the

discovery of the body, they absconded and were not apprehended for three

years, the verdict of guilty was held to be unreasonable.

In B.R.R.A. Jagath Pramawansha v. The Attorney General, CA Appeal No.

173/2005, decided on 19.03.2009, His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew held that;

The case for the prosecution depended on circumstantial evidence.

Therefore it is necessary to consider the principles governing cases of

circumstantial evidence. In King v. Abeywicrama 44 NLR 254 Soertsz J

remarked thus: In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence

the Jury must be satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt

of the accused and inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of this

innocence.

In King v. Appuhamy 46 NLR 128 Kueneman J held thus: in order to

justify the inference of guilt from purely circumstantial evidence, the

inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused

Page 5 of 18

and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable-hypothesis the that

of his guilt.

In Podisingho v. King 53 NLR 49 Dias J remarked thus: That in a case of

circumstantial evidence it is the duty of the trial Judge to tell the Jury that

such evidence must be totally inconsistent with the innocence of the accused

and must only be consistent with his guilt.

Having regard to the principles laid down in the above judicial decisions, I

hold that in a case of circumstantial evidence, if an inference of guilt is to

be drawn, such an inference must be the one and only irresistible and

inescapably conclusion that the accused committed the offence. When the

evidence adduced at the trial is considered, the one and only irresistible and

inescapable conclusion that can be arrived at is that the accused committed

the murder of Prema Jayawardwene.

His Lordship Justice Aluwihare, PC, in Junaideen Mohamed Haaris v. Attorney

General, SC Appeal 118/17, Decided on 09.11.2018 held that:

Before I consider the facts of the case and the legal issues raised in this

appeal, it should be borne in mind that the prosecution relied entirely on

circumstantial evidence to establish the charges, for the reason that there

were no eyewitnesses to substantiate any of the charges against the

Accused-Appellant. Thus, it was incumbent on the prosecution to establish

that the circumstances the prosecution relied on, are consistent only with

the guilt of the accused appellant and not with any other hypothesis.

Page 6 of 18

Regard should be had to a set of principles and rules of prudence, developed

in a series of English decisions, which are now regarded as settled law by

our courts. The two basic principles are-

i. The inference sought to be drawn must be consistent with all the

proved facts, if it is not, then the inference cannot be drawn.

ii. The proved facts should be such that they exclude every reasonable

inference from them, save the one to be drawn. If they do not exclude

other reasonable inferences, then there must be a doubt whether the

inference sought to be drawn is correct (per Watermeyer J. in R vs.

Blom 1939 A.D. 188)

At this juncture, it should be noted that the Learned High Court Judge had

considered the following items of evidence as incriminating evidence against the

Accused where she had come to the conclusion that from that evidence, the one

and only inextricable and irresistible inference is that the Accused is guilty of the

said offence.

The Learned High Court Judge also has considered the statement made by the

Accused from the dock and the recovery under Section 27 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

When we peruse the evidence placed by the prosecution, the following items of

circumstantial evidence are available in this case.

A. PW3, the husband of the deceased revealed that the Accused had an

animosity with the deceased which was not disputed by the defence.

B. The deceased had come to the watchmans post in the estate around 7 AM

to 7.30 AM on the day of the incident. It was seen by one of the workers.

C. When PW1 questioned the Accused regarding the deceased, he stated that

she had gone out to buy some crops.

D. According to PW2 namely Dilanga Sampath, he had seen the umbrella and

the purse which belonged to the deceased at the watchmans post where the

Accused stayed.

Page 9 of 18

E. According to PW9 and PW26, they saw the Accused at the bus halt in the

early morning of the following day i.e. 08th of May 2013.

F. According to PW10, the deceased had left the house around 6.20 AM to go

to the estate on the 7th of May 2013 after having tea.

G. According to PW11, the Judicial Medical Officer, Senanayake

Mudiyanselage Harshana Mahendra Kumara Senanayaka, has observed a

number of cut injuries in the deceaseds body. All the injuries are deep-cut

injuries. Further, he had identified that the incident had taken place

between the evening of the 6th of May and the evening of the 7th of May. He

further observed, there was a milky liquid in the stomach of the deceased

indicating that she had not taken anything after she left the house of PW1.

When the knife was shown to him, he identified that the injuries would have

been caused by a similar weapon. It should be noted that the particular

weapon was found at the place of the incident.

H. According to PW13 namely Dasanayake, the Police Officer, they were able

to arrest the Accused only on 13th May 2013. Through the statement of the

Accused, a number of items were recovered which were identified by the

witnesses. It should be noted that the accused was arrested after 4 days of

the incident.

I. The Police got the service of the Police Kennels Division and the sniffer dog

used for the investigation had gone from the scene of the crime to the bus

halt where the other witnesses had seen the Accused in the early morning

of the 8th May.

Page 10 of 18

This Court is mindful of the canine evidence available in this case. The sniffer dog

of the Police Kennel Division sniffed the knife and had gone to the bus halt where

the other witnesses had seen the Accused in the early morning of the 8th May. This

evidence corroborates the evidence given by PW9 and PW26.

The value of such canine evidence is discussed by His Lordship Justice Colin

Thome in Gunawardena vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1981) 2 SLR 315 at 326;

In Kanapathipillai v The Queen (supra) it was held that very convincing

expert evidence should be placed before the Court which is invited to

conclude that the mere behaviour of a police dog by itself renders the

existence of any relevant fact in a criminal trial so "highly probable or

improbable" as to justify the application of section 11 (b) of the Evidence

Ordinance.

It is common knowledge today that dogs can be specially trained to assist

in the detection of crime and that for a long time have been one of the best

known instruments of crime detection. As Gratiaen J., stated in the above

case:-

"An important clue may be discovered by an animal which would

point to the identity of the offender; but in such a case, it is the

positive evidence brought to light rather than the manner of its

discovery that constitutes relevant and admissible evidence of the

offender's guilt."

This was followed by His Lordship Justice W.L. Ranjith Silva in CA 306/2006

decided on 03.08.2011,

Page 11 of 18

In my opinion just like the evidence of an expert, if the skill and expertise

the training and experience of the tracker dog could be considered as

reliable and if the expertise and the training of the tracker himself is also

reliable then and only then the evidence of the tracker with regard to the

behaviour of the dog could be accepted as a vital piece of circumstantial

evidence against the accused.

In the instant case, the defence has not challenged the skill and training of the

tracker dog and the experience and the qualification of the dog handler. We take

notice that evidence of the witnesses who saw the Accused in the early morning is

corroborated by this piece of canine evidence. Through this evidence, the

Prosecution has proved that the Accused was last seen at the bus halt.

The fact remains that the particular watchmans hut was only used by the Accused

and it was identified by the witnesses that the particular knife was used in the

estate and was kept at the Accuseds place.

According to the evidence, the Accused did not participate in looking for the

deceased on the night of the 7th of May, and on the very next day, he escaped from

the estate.

In this instant, his subsequent conduct is a matter for us to consider.

According to Section 8 (2) of the Evidence Ordinance;

The conduct of any party, or of any agent to any party, to any suit or

proceeding in reference to such suit or proceeding, or in reference to any fact

in issue therein or relevant thereto, and the conduct of any person an offence

against whom is the subject of any proceeding, is relevant, if such conduct

Page 12 of 18

influences or is influenced by any fact in issue or relevant fact, and whether

it was previous or subsequent thereto.

Knowing the fact that the deceased was missing and people were searching for

her, leaving the estate at 4.15 in the morning without informing anyone and

staying at an unknown place is a matter to be considered.

According to E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, The Law of Evidence, Volume I, on page

233;

Absconding or flight

By the English common law, flight was considered so strong a presumption

of guilt that in cases of treason or felony, it carried the forfeiture of the

party's goods, whether he was found guilty or acquitted. But now the

position is quite different: although the conduct of a person in absconding

after the commission of an offence is evidence to show that he was concerned

in the offence it is usually a small item in the evidence on which a conviction

can be based.

Mere absence does not amount to absconding. It implies a departure with

intent to defeat or delay the arrest. It is to go out of the jurisdiction of the

court or to conceal oneself to avoid legal process. The court must be satisfied

that the accused is missing from his usual haunts under circumstances

which lead the court to infer that he is hiding in order to avoid arrest. It is

well known that some accused persons, though innocent, deliberately run

away rather than face the ordeal of a criminal trial. Evidence of alleged

Page 13 of 18

absconding is of no value when it can be otherwise explained or accounted

for.

But if it is established that the accused had absconded immediately after

the commission of the alleged offence and that the police could not trace him

for several days thereafter in spite of all efforts at his normal place of

residence or at any other place where he could normally be expected to be,

that is an important circumstance pointing to his culpability, unless he can

offer a reasonable explanation for his absence. A classic case of absconding

in a case based on circumstantial evidence in which the evidence of

absconding may have clinched the verdict of the jury against the accused

was the Mangala Eliya case. The accused was charged with the murder of

his mistress, whose throat was slashed and who had been tied to rocks and

whose body was immersed in a lake. On the day that the body floated up,

the accused, who was a teacher disappeared without any intimation to his

superiors. He was arrested about six months later in a distant village in the

jungle about one hundred miles away, where he had been teaching in a

remote village school, having changed his appearance by growing a beard.

In the instant case, there is evidence to show that the Accused was absconding.

Soon after the people started searching for the deceased, he vanished in the early

morning of the next day. This was not challenged by the defence and the Accused

had not provided an explanation. This Court observes that in view of the fact that

the Accused was employed by the deceased, the normal acceptable conduct of a lay

person would have been to assist the other people in finding the deceased and wait

until she is found. The conduct of the Accused and the improbability of the

Page 14 of 18

Accuseds conduct draw certain adverse inferences that point in the direction of

his guilt. We are mindful that the Accused has failed to give a plausible

explanation before the Trial Judge enabling the Judge to give his mind towards

the innocence of the Accused.

We further observe that the Police had found blood stains near the place where

the Accused stayed in the estate. We are also mindful of the impact of the recovery

under Section 27 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance. From his statement, the Police

had recovered items belonging to the deceased which was identified by the

witnesses. This was not controverted by the Accused.

The question before us is what is the evidential value of the discovery in

consequence of a statement made under Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

In B.R.R.A. Jagath Premawansha v. Attorney General (Supra), His Lordship

Justice Sisira de Abrew held that;

The investigating officer recovered an ear stud, a broken chain and a ladies

watch near a rubber tree in a rubber estate. These were recovered in

consequence of a statement made by the accused who at 1. 05 am pointed out

these items to the investigating officer. In Ariyasinghe v. AG (2004) 2 SLR 357

at page 386 court considered three ways in which an accused person could gain

knowledge of a thing recovered in consequence of a statement made by him.

They are as follows:

1. The accused himself hid the item

2. The Accused saw another person concealing the item

Page 15 of 18

3. A person who had seen another person concealing the item in a certain

place has told the accused about it.

In the instant case, the Accused had failed to explain how he got to know of such

items that were hidden and were later discovered based on his statement. This

Court notes that the inference can be drawn that the Accused was the person who

hid the said belongings of the deceased which were recovered from the vicinity of

the scene of the crime. This was further corroborated by the fact that the Accused

was unable to provide the Court with an explanation.

When we consider the evidence placed by the prosecution, we hold that the

prosecution had put forward a strong prima facie case.

When cogent evidence is placed against the Accused, our Courts expect the

Accused to give the Court an explanation. The question then arises as to what the

explanation given by the accused is against the said incriminating evidence. We

note that he merely denied the charge and stated as follows from the dock:

.

.

, .

At this stage, it is pertinent to reproduce the dictum of Lord Ellenborough in R Vs.

Lord Cochrane and others (1814 Gurney's Report 479):

"No person accused of crime is bound to offer any explanation of his conduct

or of circumstances of suspicion which attach to him; but, nevertheless, if

he refuses to do so, where a strong prima facie case has been made out, and

when it is in his own power to offer evidence, if such exist, in explanation of

Page 16 of 18

such suspicious circumstances which would show them to be fallacious and

explicable consistently with his innocence, it is a reasonable and justifiable

conclusion that he refrains from doing so only from the conviction that the

evidence so suppressed or not adduced would operate adversely to his

interest."

The above dictum was followed by our Courts in the following judgments.

In Sumanasena vs. Attorney General (1999) 3 SLR 137, His Lordship Justice

Jayasuriya held thus;

When the prosecution establishes a strong and incriminating evidence

against the accused, the accused in those circumstances was required in law

to offer an explanation of the highly incriminating circumstances

established against him.

In Baddewithana vs. The Attorney General (1990) 1 SLR 275, His Lordship Justice

P.R.P. Perera held thus;

From the failure of an accused to offer evidence when a prima facie case

has been made out by the prosecution and the accused is in a position to

offer an explanation, an adverse inference may be drawn under S. 114 (f) of

the Evidence Ordinance.

In Aruna Alias Podi Raja v. Attorney General, 2011 2 SLR 44, His Lordship Justice

Sisira De Abrew held that:

When prosecution established a strong incriminating evidence against an

accused in a criminal case the accused in those circumstances is required

Page 17 of 18

to offer an explanation of the highly incriminating evidence established

against him and the failure to offer such explanation suggests that he has

no explanation to offer.

Considering the above judicial decisions, we hold that the Accused failed to offer

an explanation against the evidence placed against him. The Accused is the person

who was employed by the deceased. He simply says that he does not know

anything. Nevertheless, he had not denied that he met the deceased in the

morning on the day of the incident. But he stated to the witnesses that the

deceased had gone to Polgahawela to buy some crops. However, the witnesses had

found the handbag and other belongings at the watchmans post where only the

Accused resided. Later, some items were also recovered based on the Accuseds

statement which belonged to the deceased. Subsequently, the Accused left the

place without informing anyone. When one considers the location and the time

such were recovered, the only inference this Court can draw is that it was the

Accused who concealed these items at those places which belonged to the deceased.

Considering the above evidence and the judicial decisions, we hold that the one

and only irresistible and inescapable inference that this Court can arrive at is that

the Accused committed the murder of Dissanayaka Arachchige Nilani

Dissanayaka and there is no room for doubt that someone other than the Accused

committed the said murder. We therefore hold that the Learned High Court Judge

has correctly applied the principles governing the circumstantial evidence.

For the above-said reasons, we affirm the conviction and the sentence and dismiss

the appeal.
