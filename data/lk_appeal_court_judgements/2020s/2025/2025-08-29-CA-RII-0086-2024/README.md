Written Submissions: To be filed

Dr. Sumudu Premachandra J.

1] This is an application for Restitutio in Integrum filed by the substituted

Plaintiff-Petitioner-Petitioner to set aside the order of the District Court of

Monaragala dated 21.03.2024 in Case No. 2229/L, and to set aside the

settlement entered between the parties on 05.03.2018 in the same case.

2] The Petitioner, who is the substituted Plaintiff after the death of his father

(the original Plaintiff), states that his father was the lawful owner of the land

described in Schedule A of the amended plaint. A dispute arose in 2010 when

the Respondent objected to the construction on part of this land (Schedule B),

resulting in a police complaint and a subsequent Magistrate's Court 66 order

4

granting possession of that portion to the Respondent. The original Plaintiff

thereafter filed a case in the District Court seeking a declaration of ownership

and possession. However, during the trial, a settlement was proposed and

accepted by the parties, based on an assumption that the Respondent owned

adjoining State land, but later information obtained through a Right to

Information request revealed that the Respondent owned no such land.

3] The Petitioner argues that the original Plaintiff agreed to the settlement under

false pretenses and made an application to set it aside, claiming fraud, mistake,

and misrepresentation. The District Judge initially agreed to inquire into the

matter, but after a full hearing, dismissed the Petitioners application in an order

dated 21.03.2024.

4] The Petitioner says that although the learned trial judge acknowledged the

Respondent owned no state land, the decision focused on whether the disputed

land (Schedule B) was part of the Petitioners land (Schedule A) or part of a grant

allegedly belonging to the Respondents mother. The Petitioner contends that

neither the Respondent's mother nor any other family member was called as a

witness and that no legal claim was made by any such third party, rendering

the judgment erroneous and unsupported by evidence.

5] The Petitioner further states that the Respondent gained rights to land

through a fraudulent settlement, and the District Court erred in not recognizing

this error. He emphasis that the core issue is the Respondents lack of

ownership, and without such a right, the settlement should not be valid.

6] The Petitioner also says that his request for a new survey commission to

resolve confusion in land boundaries was rejected by the court, prompting a

separate leave to appeal application (UP/H.C.C.A/L.A.09/2024) currently

pending in the Civil Appeal High Court in Badulla.

7] Basically, the learned trial judge has refused to vacate the settlement on the

basis that no fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake occurred when entering the

purported settlement.

8] I now consider the merits of the application. This application is for Restitutio

in integrum under and in terms of Article 138 of the Constitution of the

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, and it says;

Article 138. (1) The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the

provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the

correction of all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed by the High

Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by any Court

of First Instance, tribunal or other institution and sole and exclusive

cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, of all

causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things [of which such High

Court, Court of First Instance], tribunal or other institution may have taken

cognizance:

Provided that no judgement, decree or order of any court shall be reversed

or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not

prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of

justice.

9] Thus, this court has the power to correct all errors in fact or in law, by way of

appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, subject to the said error has not

prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice.

Restitutio in Integrum is available for judgments of original courts entered

consequent to misrepresentation of facts or fraud due to which the party seeking

relief has suffered damages: (Vide Perera vs. Wijewickrama 15 NLR 411,

Kusumawathie vs. Wijesinghe [2001] 3 SLR 238.)

10] In Kumudu Samanthi Akmeemana v. Araliya Kankaanamge Somasiri

de Silva & Others CA/RI/1/2018, Decided on 21.02.2019, His Lordship

Samayawardhena, J, considered the powers in granting relief under restitutio in

integrum as follows;

It must be stressed that the power to grant relief by way of restitutio in

integrum is a matter of grace and discretion. (Usoof v. Nadarajah Chettiar1)

The petitioner cannot seek restitution as of right. There are several threshold

matters to be sorted out before addressing the core issue. One such

6

important hurdle to overcome is that relief by way of restitutio in integrum

should be sought for with the utmost promptitude. Vide Menchinahamy v.

Muniweera, Babun Appu v. Simon Appu, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation

Limitted v. Shanmugam , it is crystal clear that the petitioner has

not acted with the utmost promptitude when she decided to come before

this Court more than two years after the District Court held against her. The

delay is too long by any stretch of imagination particularly because the final

order of the District Court against her was not ex parte but inter

partes The explanation for delay over two years is unacceptable.

Hence, on that ground alone, the application of the petitioner is liable to be

dismissed.

11] In Diathu Arachchige Lily Silva vs Registrar General and others, C.A.

No. Rll-0003-2016, DECIDED ON 23.06.2020, Dr. Ruwan Fernando, J,

enunciated as;

In Sri Lanka, the remedy of restitutio in integrum has taken deep root in

the practice and procedure of our Courts (Abeysekera v. Haramanis Appu

14 NLR 353).). Cases in which application for relief by way of restitution in

respect of judgments of original courts have been made can be broadly

classified under two heads: (a) where a judgment has been obtained by

fraud or where there has been a discovery of fresh evidence; (h) where a

judgment has been entered of consent and there has been an absence of a

real consent such as in cases of fraud, fear, excess of authority and mistake

(Dember v. Hakel 49 NLR 62, p. 66).

12] The Petitioner said the Respondent did not have ownership of the adjacent

land claimed, and it was revealed as State Land; thus, there was a fraud.

However, it is seen that the terms of settlement were entered to demarcate the

boundaries of the land with the full consent and knowledge of the parties.

13] In Lameer v. Senarathna [1995] 2 SLR 13, in the case of restitution on

Laesio Enormis, it was held that the Court cannot grant relief by way of

restitution to a party who has agreed in Court to sell property at a lesser price

7

with the full knowledge of its true value. In the case in hand, the Petitioner has

agreed to resolve the issue on a commission, to be done by the Surveyor General.

14] The terms entered on 05.03.2018 are as follows;

01. ,

.

02. F.T.P 162. 11

, F.T.P 162. 42

.

03.

04. 6663 2014.03.08

.

05. .

06.

.

15] In the above settlement, it is clear that the Petitioner admitted the

Defendant-Respondents land is a state land. (clause 01). And they further

admitted that the Plaintiffs (the Petitioners) land is Lot 11 and the Defendants

land was 42 of plan F.T.P 162. They agreed to demarcate the northern boundary

of the Plaintiff and the southern boundary of the Defendant and settle the

dispute. They agreed that the survey should be based on 6663 and 08.03.2014

dated Defendants plan. They agreed on the survey that the southern portion of

the land belongs to the Plaintiff, the northern portion of the land belongs to the

Defendant, and the cost of the survey should be borne by both parties equally.

Thus, it is seen that the ownership of the Defendant has been admitted by the

Petitioner and with full knowledge and consent, the plan was prepared.

8

16] Under section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code, the dispute can be settled by

parties outside courts. It says;

408. If an action be adjusted wholly or part by any lawful agreement or

compromise, or if the defendant satisfy the plaintiff in respect to the whole

or any part of the matter of the action, such agreement, compromise, or

satisfaction shall be notified to the court by motion made in presence of, or

on notice to, all the parties concerned, and the court shall pass a decree in

accordance therewith, so far as it relates to the action, and such decree

shall be final, so far as relates to so much of the subject-matter of the action

as is dealt with by the agreement, compromise, or satisfaction.

17] Thus, it is lawful to enter a settlement at the request of the parties, and the

parties cannot go back thereafter. It was held in City Properties (Pvt) Ltd vs

Edirisinghe [2011] 2 SLR 273. Once the parties enter the consent decree, they

cannot go back, and the terms of settlement should be honoured.

18] In Dassanaike v. Dassanaike 30 N.L.R. 385 at 387, Fisher, C. J. observed:

It is fundamentally necessary before section 408 can be applied that it

should be clearly established that what is put forward as an agreement or

compromise of an action by the parties was intended by them to be such.

19] In the case of The People's Bank v. Gilbert Weerasinghe (1986) 2 CALR

260, it was held that an agreement must be expressed in clear and unambiguous

terms to have a binding effect on the parties to give it the effect of amounting to

an implied waiver of the right of appeal.

20] Soertsz, J. in Punchibanda v. Punchibanda 42 NLR 382 noted how terms

of settlement to be set out as below:

"This court has often pointed out that when settlements, adjustments,

admissions, are reached or made, their nature should be explained clearly

to the parties and their signatures or thumb impressions should be

obtained. The consequence of this obvious precaution not being taken is that

9

this court has its work too unduly increased by wasteful appeals and by

applications being made to it for revision or restitutio in integrum

21] In the case in hand, there was no dispute between the parties when it was

entered. After the survey, the Petitioner is disputing the terms on fraud, which

cannot be done. The effect of a settlement is discussed in Gunawardena v. Ran

Menike and Others [2002] 3 S. L.R. 243 and the Court held;

Where there has been a settlement or compromise it must be in strict

compliance with the provisions of section 91 and section 408 of the Civil

Procedure Code [Emphasis is added]

22] Thus, it is settled law, once the parties agree upon a settlement; they cannot

go back and must be in strict compliance. It was held where a consent decree

has been entered; the court has no jurisdiction to vary such a decree on the

application of one party except with the consent of the other. (Vide MAMNOOR

v. MOHAMED 23NLR 493, PUNCHI BANDA v. NOORDEEN 30 NLR481, PERERA

vs PERERA 50NLR 81)

23] Moreover, in Nandawathie vs Jayatilake and Others [2005] 3 Sri L R.

230, Somawansa, J. (P/CA) held as;

Once the terms of settlement as agreed upon are presented to court and

notified thereto and recorded by court a party cannot resile from the

settlement even though the decree has not yet been entered. (followed

SINNA VELOO vs MESSRS LIPTON LTD 66 NLR 214

24] The Petitioner tried to rescind the settlement, stating that there is no such

state land owned by the Respondent adjacent to his land; thus, the Respondent

had entered into the settlement on the misrepresentation of the facts. The

jurisdiction of this court should be invoked to rescind the purported settlement.

25] This statement to rescind the settlement was based on the facts provided

dated 03.08.2019 by the Information Officer of the Divisional Secretariat of

Monaragala under the provisions of the Right to Information Act. However, at

the inquiry on 24.02.2021, the Land Officer of Monaragala Divisional

10

Secretariat, D.A. Sepala, on the cross-examination, has produced the ledger of

the Respondents land and admitted that the Respondents mother, Rajakaruna

Nawaratna Mudiyanselage Leelawathie, was given a 1-Acre 1-Rood 28-perches

land under LDO permit bearing No. 20865 on 27.07.1996 under Jaya Bhumi

scheme. (Vide pages 169 to 173 of the certified copy of Monaragala District Court

Case No. L/2229) This ledger was marked as X at the inquiry. This witness

confirmed there was no dispossession of this land other than that. This

particular was produced on oath and was subjected to cross-examination. On

the other hand, the letter of the Information Officer is merely a piece of paper

under the eyes of law. Thus, it is clear that, on the available facts, there was no

misrepresentation as mentioned by the Petitioner.

26] On careful perusal, there are two plaints, dated 08.12.2010 and 30.07.2014,

that can be found. The latter must be the amended plaint. On that plaint, it is

clearly seen that the original Plaintiff has filed an action of rei vindicatio. In an

action for rei vindicatio, the Plaintiff must prove the title to the impugned land

and identification of the land must also be proved on the balance of probabilities.

(Vide Bank of Ceylon vs A.C. Rajasingham and others,

SC/APPEAL/40/2014, Decided on: 04.07.2023, by His Lordship

Samayawardhena, J.) On the other hand, the Defendant has no burden to prove

his title. Herat J. in Wanigaratne v. Juwanis Appuhamy 65 NLR 167 held

that;

The defendant in a rei vindicatio action need not prove anything, still less,

his own title. The plaintiff cannot ask for a declaration of title in his favour

merely on the strength that the defendants title is poor or not established.

The plaintiff must prove and establish his title.

27] In the case in hand, the Defendant has produced the LDO permit and thus,

there is no misrepresentation as such, as mentioned in the petition. As I earlier

noted, once facts are agreed and admissions are made, the Plaintiff (the

Petitioner) cannot go back. In Mariammai V Pethrupillai 21 NLR 200, the court

held that;

11

if a party in a case makes an admission for whatever reason, he must

stand by it; it is impossible for him to argue a point on appeal which he

formally gave up in the court below

28] Further in Uvais V Punyawathie [1993] 2 SLR 46, the apex court held as

follows;

It is sometimes permissible to withdraw admission on question of law but

admission of facts cannot be withdrawn

29] Since the admission was not a fact in law, the Petitioner cannot ask this

court to rescind it. Further, I noted the order of the District Court made on

21.03.2024 and instead of filing a leave to appeal application to the Civil

Appellate High Court of Badulla, (it is seen that the Petitioner has filed leave to

appeal application bearing No. UP/HCCA/LA/09/2024 against the District

Court Order dated 20.06.2024) thus, the Petitioner had alternative remedies and

this application therefore cannot be successful. (Vide: Menchinahamy v.

Muniweera 52 NLR 409, his Lordship Dias J. held: Restitutio in integrum is not

available if the petitioner has another remedy open to her.). It should be noted

that this case was filed on 18.10.2024, after 7 months, thus the Petitioner is

guilty of laches1.

30] For the foregoing reasons, we see no merit in this application. Thus, restitutio

in integrum was dismissed, and formal notice was refused. No costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL R. GURUSINGHE J. I agree JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

1 In the case of Menchinahamy v Muniweera, 52 NLR 409, it was held as follows: The remedy by way of restitutio-in-integrum is an extraordinary remedy and is given only under very exceptional circumstances. It is only a party to a contract or to legal proceedings who can ask for this relief. The remedy must be sought for with the utmost promptitude. It is not available if the applicant has any other remedy open to him.
