Judgment

1. This is an appeal against the judgment and sentence of the learned High Court Judge

of Balapitiya, by which the accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

“Appellant”) was convicted and sentenced for offences punishable under Sections 354

and 364(2)(e) read with Section 364(2) of the Penal Code.

2. In the petition of appeal there were ten grounds of appeal but during the argument, the

appellant urged only five grounds namely:

a. The prosecution has not proved the charges of rape and kidnapping from

lawful guardianship beyond reasonable doubt;

b. The prosecution has failed to explain the delay in making the complaint and

the vagueness of the period in the indictment;

c. The main prosecution witnesses’ testimonies consist of inter se and per se

contradictions and therefore they have failed the test of credibility’

d. The learned High Court Judge has not considered the accused’s dock

statement; and,

e. The learned trial Judge has rejected the defense evidence on unreasonable

grounds and not given the benefit of the doubt to the accused.

Background to the appeal:

3. The appellant is married to the prosecutrix’s sister. According to the prosecutrix’s

testimony, the appellant allegedly raped her on three separate occasions. The first

incident is said to have occurred in a cinnamon field near the house where the

prosecutrix resided. The second incident allegedly took place at the house of the

prosecutrix’s sister. The third incident is reported to have occurred when the

prosecutrix was living with another person named Chamith, with whom she had

eloped.

4. In view of the arguments advanced by the appellant, one of the primary questions to

be determined in the present appeal is whether the delay in making a complaint affects

CA/HCC/0199/2023

3 | P a g e

the credibility of the prosecution’s case. Admittedly, the prosecutrix first lodged a

complaint in 2011, almost five years after the alleged first incident of rape. According

to the indictment, all three acts of rape were alleged to have occurred between January

2006 and December 2006. Nevertheless, the learned High Court Judge convicted the

appellant on only the first two counts, holding that the remaining charges in the

indictment fell outside the period specified therein.

5. It is trite law that a delayed police complaint does not automatically render the

evidence unreliable, but it is a crucial factor for courts to consider, as the credibility of

the evidence is assessed by examining the reasons for the delay. If the delay is

reasonably explained by factors like fear, embarrassment, or a lack of understanding,

the court may still accept the testimony. Conversely, unexplained delays can weaken

the complainant's credibility and raise doubts about the accuracy of their account.

6. It this connection I would like to consider the judgment in the case of Sumanasena

vs. Attorney General [1999] 3 Sri LR. 137, wherein His Lordship Justice Jayasuriya

stated thus:

Just because the witness is a belated witness Court ought not to reject his

testimony on that score alone, Court must inquire into the reason for the delay and

if the reason for the delay is plausible and justifiable the court could act on the

belated witness.”

7. On a consideration of the principles laid down in the above judicial decision, I hold

that the evidence of the witness should not be rejected on the ground of delay itself if

the delay has been reasonably explained. Thus, in the present case, I must consider

whether the delay has been reasonably explained.

8. The delay in making a complaint in cases involving offences against a child must be

considered differently. In the present case, the victim remained silent for almost five

years, without informing anyone about the rape or sexual harassment allegedly

committed by her sister’s husband.

9. A child’s reason for silence has been explained in The Crown Court Compendium

Part I (published in May 2016 - page 10-22), as follows:

CA/HCC/0199/2023

4 | P a g e

“Experience has shown that children may not speak out about something that has

happened to them for a number of reasons. A child may

 be confused about what has happened or about whether or not to speak out;

 blame him/herself for what has happened or be afraid that he/she will be blamed

for it and punished;

 be afraid of the consequences of speaking about it, either for him/herself and/or

for another member of the family;

 may feel that s/he may not be believed;

 may have been told to say nothing and threatened with the consequences of doing

so;

 may be embarrassed because s/he did not appreciate at the time that what was

happening was wrong, or because s/he enjoyed some of the aspects of the

attention they were getting;

 simply blank what happened out and get on with their lives until the point comes

when they feel ready or the need to speak out {e.g. for the sake of a younger child

who s/he feels may be at risk};

 may feel conflicted: loving the abuser but hating the abuse.”

10. Additionally, in The Crown Court Bench Book (published in March 2010 - at page

367) it is stated as follows:

“Children do not have the same life experience as adults. They do not have the

same standards of logic and consistency, and their understanding may be severely

limited for a number of reasons, such as their age and immaturity. Life viewed

through the eyes and mind of a child may seem very different from life viewed by

an adult. Children may not fully understand what it is that they are describing,

and they may not have the words to describe it. They may, however, have come to

realise that what they are describing is, by adult standards, bad or, in their

perception, naughty.”

11. In Daradagamage Chandraratne Jayawardane alias Shantha v. The Attorney

General - Court of Appeal case No. CA/85/2013, decided on 25.05.2018, it was

observed as follows:

CA/HCC/0199/2023

5 | P a g e

“Time and again courts have discussed the acceptance of evidence of children of

tender ages. Our judges are not there to test the memory of the witness; they are

expected to find actual fact and the truth. Witnesses are human beings; they are

not memory machines nor robots to repeat the incident as it was. Further, the

natural behaviour of human beings is to forget incidents, especially sad memories.

No one wants to re-visit painful moments and keep detailed memories with them.

We are also mindful most of our courts with due respect, are not child friendly.

12. The correct approach to appreciating and evaluating the evidence of a witness was

succinctly stated by the Supreme Court of India in State of Uttar Pradesh v. M.K.

Anthony, AIR 1985 SC 48, wherein it observed:

While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be whether the

evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth. Once that

impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the court to scrutinise the

evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies, draw-backs and

infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate them to find out

whether it is against the general tenor of the evidence given by the witness and

whether the earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken as to render it unworthy

of belief. Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core of the case,

hyper-technical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here or there

from the evidence, attaching importance to some technical error committed by the

investigating officer not going to the : root of the matter would not ordinarily

permit rejection of the evidence as a whole. If the court before whom the witness

gives evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion about the general tenor of

evidence given by the witness, the appellate court which had not this benefit will

have to attach due weight to the appreciation of evidence by the trial court and

unless there are reasons weighty and formidable it would not be proper to reject

the evidence on the ground of minor variations or infirmities in the matter of

trivial details. Even honest and truthful witnesses may differ in some details

unrelated to the main incident because power of observation, retention and

reproduction differ with individuals.

13. In the present case, the evidence indicates that the victim was about eight years old at

the time of the alleged offence. The alleged perpetrator was her sister’s husband. It

further appears from the testimony that the victim’s mother is not an educated person

CA/HCC/0199/2023

6 | P a g e

and may even be illiterate. Moreover, there is no evidence to suggest that either the

mother or the sister of the victim was employed. The appellant, on the other hand,

appears to have been the sole breadwinner of the family and has two children. The

evidence of the victim’s mother suggests that she wished for the appellant to be

discharged in order to secure the welfare of her daughter’s family, as her daughter was

married to the appellant. Ostensibly, the victim’s mother did not treat these incidents

with the seriousness they warranted, either due to ignorance or poverty.

14. Furthermore, the first alleged incident is said to have taken place in 2006. The

victim’s statement was recorded in 2011, i.e., five years after the alleged incident,

when she was only 13 years old. She later testified in June 2022, eleven years after

her statement was recorded. In these circumstances, it would be unrealistic to expect

her testimony to be entirely free from contradictions or omissions when compared

with the statement given to the police. Therefore, the Court must be mindful of these

facts and circumstances when evaluating the credibility of her testimony. To elaborate,

the victim’s evidence should be analyzed and assessed within this particular context.

15. In evaluating a belated complaint and the evidence of a child rape victim, the Court

should be conscious of and take into account the following considerations:

16. When a child of tender years is subjected to sexual abuse by a close family member, a

different scenario arises in which the victim may be reluctant to immediately

complain or inform others due to the family connection. In contrast, if the abuser is a

complete outsider, the child is more likely to promptly disclose the incident. This

difference arises because, when the perpetrator is a close family elder, inhibitions,

arising from stress, fear, or self-blame, may prevail, even in the absence of a direct

threat.

17. This is particularly true in the context of the social and cultural conditions prevailing

in rural communities within Asian societies. Children in such environments may not

fully appreciate that they are being abused and may even tend to believe that they are

at fault. These circumstances often inhibit and prevent child victims from making

immediate disclosures.

CA/HCC/0199/2023

7 | P a g e

18. However, with the passage of time, as the child matures and gains a clearer

understanding that a wrong has been committed, the victim may eventually disclose

the abuse to a third party, albeit after a considerable lapse of time.

19. In the present case, the accused was the husband of the victim’s elder sister and was

significantly older in age. As narrated by the victim, she initially refrained from

disclosing the incident, as she feared that such disclosure might cause harm to her

sister.

20. Several years later, however, she revealed the incident to a probation officer. In light

of these circumstances, the delay in disclosure and the eventual reporting are

reasonably explainable.

21. In evaluating her evidence, it is also relevant to note that the suggestion made by the

defence is that the victim fabricated the allegation because the appellant had objected

to her relationship with another boy. Against this backdrop, it is necessary to consider

whether such a suggestion casts any doubt on the veracity of her testimony.

22. First of all, given the tender age of the victim, it is unrealistic to expect that a

fabricated story would extend over several years and involve multiple allegations.

Ordinarily, if a story were fabricated, one would expect the allegation to be direct and

uncomplicated.

23. Correspondingly, it is improbable to assume that a child of such tender age could have

fabricated a complex story involving several events, and yet, years later, narrate the

same incident in detail when giving evidence, without any significant contradictions

or omissions. This circumstance, therefore, adds to the credibility of her testimony.

24. As is evident from the line of cross-examination by the defense, an attempt was made

to show that the victim falsely implicated the appellant in the charge of rape due to the

appellant’s objection to her affair with Chamith. It is noteworthy that, by the time the

victim disclosed the incident to a probation officer, she had already been assaulted by

Chamith, and it was her mother who handed her over to the probation authorities.

Therefore, at that point, the victim had already separated from Chamith, making it

difficult, if not impossible, to infer that her complaint against the appellant was

motivated by his opposition to her relationship with Chamith.

CA/HCC/0199/2023

8 | P a g e

25. Furthermore, the conduct of the victim does not suggest that she intended to lodge a

complaint with the police against the appellant or have him arrested. Rather, she

casually narrated her ordeal to a probation officer, and it was that officer who

informed the police, which in turn led to the investigation of the crimes.

26. The defence has neither raised nor established any significant contradiction or

omission. Considering the totality of the evidence and the circumstances discussed

above, I am of the view that it is safe to accept and act upon the testimony of the

prosecutrix, as rightly done by the learned Trial Judge.

27. In Dharmasiri v. Republic of Sri Lanka (CA 019/2008): The Court emphasized that

the belatedness of a witness's statement does not alone discredit their testimony. The

court must inquire into the reason for the delay and, if the reason is plausible and

justifiable, the evidence can be acted upon.

28. Ajith Samarakoon v. The Republic (Kobaigane Murder Case): The Court held that

the belatedness of a witness's statement does not entitle the court to reject the

testimony solely on that ground. The court must consider the reasons for the delay,

and if they are justifiable, the evidence can be accepted.

29. The second witness who testified for the prosecution was T. Somalatha, the mother of

the prosecutrix. According to her evidence, she was unaware of any of the alleged

offences committed against PW1 until a probation officer informed her. She further

stated that, as the prosecutrix had been assaulted by Chamith, she handed her over to

the probation authorities. Somalatha’s evidence clearly indicates that she is illiterate

and had not reported the matter to the police, even when the prosecutrix had eloped

with Chamith. She approached the Probation Office only after learning that the

prosecutrix had been ill-treated by Chamith.

30. A careful examination of the testimony of PW2 reveals that she too did not treat the

ordeal suffered by PW1 with due seriousness, as she wished to ensure that the

appellant’s family, particularly his two children, would not become destitute by

disclosing these incidents to the police.

CA/HCC/0199/2023

31. The learned Trial Judge has convicted the appellant only on two counts, namely,

count 1 and count 2. During the cross-examination of the prosecutrix, several

contradictions were marked by the counsel for the appellant.

32. The Court’s attention was also drawn to certain omissions in the statement made by

the prosecutrix to the police. As stated elsewhere in this judgment, the credibility of

the victim’s testimony must be assessed in the context of her age at the time of the

alleged offence, her age when the police statement was recorded, and the lapse of time

between the incident and the trial. It would therefore be unrealistic to expect her to

recount the ordeal with photographic precision, and any discrepancies in her

testimony must be evaluated against these circumstances.

33. It is also important to note that the prosecutrix never admitted to the existence of any

of the contradictions marked by the defence, nor did she admit to any of the omissions

highlighted during cross-examination. Moreover, the defence did not call any police

officer to prove the said contradictions. Consequently, those contradictions remain

unproved.

34. The other point to be emphasized is that the said contradictions, even if established,

cannot be considered material so as to affect the core of the prosecution case or cast

doubt on the victim’s testimony. The contradiction marked D1 related to the manner

in which the victim was taken to the nearby cinnamon field, whether she was dragged,

as stated in the police statement, or simply accompanied by the appellant. The next

contradiction concerned the attire of the appellant at the time of the offence, whether

he was wearing a sarong or trousers. These contradictions, however, are immaterial

and do not undermine the credibility of the victim’s testimony, particularly in view of

the lapse of time between the date of the offence, the recording of the statement, and

the giving of evidence.

35. Similarly, the omissions, namely, the victim’s failure to mention the 2nd and 3rd

incidents of rape in her police statement, do not, in my view, adversely affect the

credibility of her testimony, particularly as the learned High Court Judge has not

convicted the appellant on the charges relating to those incidents. Another omission

brought to the attention of the Court was that the victim had not stated in her police

statement that she first disclosed the alleged offence to her mother. For the reasons

CA/HCC/0199/2023

10 | P a g e

already discussed, I do not regard this omission as significant in assessing the

credibility of the victim’s testimony.

36. Accordingly, the said contradictions and omissions, taken either individually or

collectively, do not cast any doubt on the reliability of the victim’s evidence.

37. As held in Sumith Kumara Vs.Attorney General [2012] 2 Sri.LR 311 Overdue

importance cannot be given to minor discrepancies. Discrepancies which do not go to

the root of the matter and shake the basic version of the witness, therefore cannot be

attached with undue importance.

38. In Miller vs Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All.E R 372, Lord Denning summarized

the requirements of standard of proof to convict the accused in a criminal case as

follows:

It need not reach certainty, but it must carry a high degree of probability.

Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond a shadow of

doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it permits fanciful

possibilities to deflect the course of justice.

39. The learned High Court Judge has, in his judgment, duly considered the issues of

delay in lodging the complaint, as well as the contradictions and omissions, while

giving due weight to the age of the victim at the time of the offence. Thus, in light of

the established legal principles and the strength of the evidence, I see no ground to

disturb the findings of the learned High Court Judge.

40. In his dock statement, the appellant alleged that Chamith Madhushanka had broken

open the door of his house, assaulted his wife with a knife, and that a complaint was

made to the Uragaha Police in that regard. He further stated that he had been falsely

implicated in another case by the victim. It is, however, significant that in his dock

statement the appellant did not deny any of the charges levelled against him.

41. Moreover, during the trial, none of these incidents were even suggested to the

prosecution witnesses, nor was any evidence led by the defence to corroborate the

appellant’s version. The dock statement, therefore, does not create any doubt as to the

prosecution case. Accordingly, even if the learned High Court Judge has failed to

CA/HCC/0199/2023

11 | P a g e

evaluate the dock statement, I am of the view that no prejudice or injustice has been

caused to the appellant.

42. Upon consideration of the above, I find no ground to interfere with the findings of the

learned High Court Judge. The judgment dated 10.08.2023 of the High Court of

Balapitiya is accordingly affirmed, and the appeal is dismissed.
