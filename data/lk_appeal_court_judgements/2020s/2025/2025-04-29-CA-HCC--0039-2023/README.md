JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo under Sections 54(A) (d) and 54(A) (b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for

Possession and Trafficking of 33.25 grams of Heroin (diacetylmorphine) on

20th September 2016.

After the trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts by the Learned

High Court Judge of Colombo who thereby sentenced him to life

imprisonment on 8th December 2022.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

referred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given his consent to argue this matter in his absence. At the hearing,

the Appellant was connected via zoom platform from prison.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. The case for the prosecution does not satisfy the test of probability.

2. The rejection of the defence evidence was on a wrong premise.

In this case the raid was conducted based upon specific information that was

received by the Police Narcotics Bureau. The raid was headed by PW1 along

with a team of police officers from the Bureau in Colombo-01, all of whom

have been named as witnesses in the indictment including the relevant

Government Analyst. The prosecution had called PW1, PW7, PW10 and

PW13 to give evidence and closed their case. The production chain had been

admitted under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code. The

prosecution marked productions P1-P12 in support of their case.

When the defence was called, the Appellant had made a statement from the

Dock and closed the defence case.

Background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

On the 20th of September 2016 PW7 had received information that a person

called Anton from the Dematagoda area is carrying Heroin to a Watta

close to De Lasalle Junction in a three-wheeler bearing No. HQ 2899 and the

informant who had alerted the police had asked them to rush to the spot.

Acting on that information a police team headed by PW1 had left the Police

Narcotics Bureau around 13:40 hours and reached the place of raid at about

14:10 hours. PW1 and PW7 were in civil dress while others were clad in police

uniform. The team had reached and parked/halted 20 meters away from the

De Lasalle junction. After meeting the informant, PW1 and PW7 had placed

themselves near the Muthuwella playground and the other officers who were

in police uniform had been placed near the gate of the school. The distance

between each of them were about 5 meters.

Upon seeing the particular three-wheeler described by the informant, as per

the order of PW1, PW8 had signalled it to stop. The vehicle was made to park

on the side of the road. PW1 had observed that there was nobody in the

three-wheeler except the driver. When PW1 and PW7 had checked the

Appellant who was the driver of the vehicle, according to the officers, he had

panicked. Thereafter, he was subjected to a body search and the police

officers found a small parcel in the from right side pocket of the Appellants

pair of shorts. PW1 had taken the parcel into his custody and inspected the

same. The parcel contained some brown coloured substance. As it reacted

for Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) the Appellant was arrested immediately. When

the Appellant was handcuffed, he had tried to escape from police custody.

The team has returned to the Police Narcotics Bureau at about 16:00 hours.

The substance was weighed at the Police Narcotics Bureau and was found to

be about 70.400 grams. The production was sealed and handed over to PW10

who was then in charge of the production which was numbered 20/2016.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the

commission of the offence by the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Hence,

an accused person has no burden to prove his case unless he pleads a

general or a special exception set out in the Penal Code.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are

of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions.

CA/HCC/39/23

In the Attorney-General v. Rawther 25 NLR 385, Ennis, J. states thus: [1987} 1 SLR 155

"The evidence must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence.

His innocence is presumed in law, from the start of the case, and his

guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:

the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required in

a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree is

well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree of

probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond

the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it

admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the

evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility

in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence, of course it is

possible, but not in the least probable, the case is proved beyond

reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.

As the appeal grounds raised by the Appellant are interrelated, the grounds

will be considered together in this case.

Probability plays a crucial role in persuading a judge on specific points, as

the higher the probability of an assumption, the greater the likelihood of

convincing the judge. Probability is highly significant in criminal

investigations, where it is utilized to evaluate the relevance of different types

of evidence. In order to accuse someone "beyond a reasonable doubt," it is

essential to have strong evidence, which often involves making certain

assumptions to draw conclusions. The likelihood of these assumptions being

true is specifically referred to as the principle of probability in legal terms.

According to the information the policemen were called to the place of arrest

immediately. According to PW7 he had received the information at 12:40

hours. PW1 was informed at about 12:50 hours. The team had left the

Bureau at 13:40 hours. Even though the informant requested that the

policemen rush to the sight, the police had taken nearly one hour to leave

the Bureau. Further, the defence had brought to the notice of the Court that

the time at which the information had been received had been overwritten

and the time of the entry made at 12:20 hours had been altered to state as

12:40 hours. Hence, the learned Counsel for the defence contended that if

the information had been received at 12:20 hours where the police were

requested to rush to the site, it is highly improbable for PW7 to take 30

minutes to inform PW1 about the information.

Police officers notes are frequently regarded as critical forms of evidence,

particularly in criminal proceedings. Even minor alterations to these records

can raise concerns regarding the credibility of the documentation and the

intent. As a result, most law enforcement institutions implement stringent

policies that regulate how and when officers may amend their notes.

In absence of any plausible explanation, an alteration, if highlighted,

definitely affects the integrity of the investigation conducted by the police.

Therefore, disregarding the highlighted time alteration has caused great

prejudice to the Appellant.

The defence had never stated that the person who was in the three-wheeler

escaped when four police officers surrounded the three-wheeler. The position

of the defence is that the person who was seated at the back of the three-

wheeler escaped after seeing the police officer who signalled for the three-

wheeler to be stopped by the roadside. The learned High Court Judge had

mixed up the evidence of the prosecution and the defence and on that

misdirection had rejected the defence evidence.

CA/HCC/39/23

The profound duty of the trial court is to consider the evidence placed by the

prosecution and the defence on equal footings to arrive at its finding.

In R v. Hepworth 1928 (AD) 265, at 277, Curlewis JA stated:

A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim

the benefit of any omission or mistake made by the other side,

and a Judge's position in a criminal trial is not merely that of an

umpire to see that the rules of the game are applied by both sides.

A Judge is an administrator of justice, not merely a figure-head,

he has not only to direct and control the proceedings according to

recognised rules of procedure but to see that justice is done.

In this case, the Learned High Court Judge had not considered the

probability factors in conjunction with the defences evidence. The rejection

of defences evidence without proper analysis had caused great prejudice to

the Appellant.

The burden of proof is usually on the person who brings a claim in a dispute.

It is often associated with the Latin maxim semper necessitas probandi

incumbit ei qui agit, a translation of which is: "the necessity of proof always

lies with the person who lays charges."

The learned defence Counsel brought to the notice of this Court that the

officers engaged in the raid were later taken into custody on allegation of

carrying Heroin. Hence, the allegation that there is a possibility that they

had only produced a small quantity of Heroin and had concealed the rest.

Law enforcement institutions are entrusted with a diverse set of rules and

regulations that must be followed in order to maintain a high degree of

integrity within police departments and to prevent oversights. Where this

does not function well, law enforcement officers may become prone to

careless behaviour and unlawful activities (Handbook on Police

Accountability, Oversight and Integrity- Criminal Justice Handbook

Series).

Considering the two grounds of appeal discussed above, the irregularity and

the failure occasioned in this case cannot be rectified by this court as they

have caused great prejudice to the Appellant.

As the prosecution had failed in its duty to prove this case beyond a

reasonable doubt, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the

Learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 08/12/2022 on the Appellant.

Therefore, he is acquitted from this case and the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
