JUDGEMENT

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J.

1. This application for a writ of certiorari is sought to quash an arbitral

award (P-7) made under the Industrial Disputes Act. The Minister of

Labour has referred this dispute for arbitration acting under Section

4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act (the IDA). The said award has then

been published in the Gazette Extraordinary bearing No. 2356/35,

dated 03.11.2023 (P-7). The arbitration was between the petitioner, Sri

Lankan Catering Ltd., and the 4th respondent.

2. Prior to consideration of the legal issues, it is prudent to narrate in brief

the facts that led to this dispute. The 4th respondent was employed by

the petitioner as a Staff Facilities Attendant, in 15.10.1990 and after

serving for a period of 30 years, retired on 28.12.2020 as a supervisor.

A bonus payment was made by the petitioner in April 2021. The 4th

respondent made a complaint to the Labour Commissioner alleging the

non-payment of the said bonus, which he claims was due to him. It is

this dispute that has been so referred for arbitration. The arbitrator

held that the 4th respondent is entitled to the bonus payment based on

the collective agreement and awarded a months salary being a sum of

Rs. 143,908.00. The ground on which the petitioner is assailing the said

award is that the arbitrator erred in holding that the 4th respondent was

WRT-0451-2024

Page 3 of 10

entitled to receive bonus based on clause 11.1 of the collective

agreement (P-2).

3. It is common ground that there is a collective agreement between the

petitioner and the employees (P-2). Clause 11 thereof provides for what

is referred to as the profit bonus. Paragraph 11 reads as follows:

11.1. The Board of Directors will decide annually on the payment of bonus, if any, to the employees, which will be solely dependent on the profits made by the company during the previous financial year. The decision on the quantum of the bonus for the year under reference is the sole discretion of the Board of Directors. In case there is a disagreement with regard to the quantum of bonus declared by the Board of Directors, initially all attempts should be made to come to a settlement through negotiations and discussions with the Management within a period of 7 (seven) days. If either party is not in agreement for settlement, the Management will refer the matter to the EFC and the decision arrived at EFC with the Management and the Parent Union will be the final.

(a) Employees in the service of the Company during the entirety

of the previous Financial year for which the bonus is paid will be entitled for the full bonus declared. (b) Employees in the service of the Company for less than the

full period of the Financial year for which the bonus is paid, will be on a pro-rata basis provided that he/she is being confirmed within the period of the financial year. (c) Payment of Bonus will be made on or before 15th December

of each year.

11.2. The Company may withhold the payment of the entirety or part of the bonus to employees where attendance, punctuality, conduct or attitude is not satisfactory. 11.3. The employees who have been or unauthorized absence during the period under review for the payment of bonus, twice the number of days no-pay will be deducted from his/ her entitlement of bonus. 11.4. The bonus will be paid for those employees as set out in 11.1 (a) & (b), who are actively in service at the time of the payment of bonus.

4. According to the arbitration award, the arbitrator has found that the

applicant, W. K. Athawudaarachchi, the 4th respondent was employed

by the petitioner from 15.10.1990 to 15.10.2020 and has retired after

30 years of service on 28.12.2020. The arbitrator has referred to clause

11 of the collective agreement and then concluded that the 4th

respondent is entitled to the said bonus payment as he was in active

service as at 15.12.2020 which is the date on which the bonus is due

as per clause 11.1 (c). The arbitrator also finds that the bonus was not

paid on 15.12.2020 but in April 2021 but was for the financial year

2019/2020. He then refers to the MOU and observes that the said MOU

was signed on 07.04.2021. It was then concluded that the bonus due

on 15.12.2020 was in fact made on 07.04.2021. Accordingly, the

arbitrator held that this bonus was in fact earned by the 4th respondent

and accordingly made the award. The conclusion of the arbitrator is

that the bonus payment was in fact the payment agreed to by clause 11

of the collective agreement and the MOU was a subsequent

understanding to make the payment.

5. According to the learned Counsel for the petitioner, the payment of

bonus for the financial year 2019/2020 was not the regular profit

bonus under clause 11 of the collective agreement. Since there was no

profit in the year 2019/2020 the bonus was not declared and no

payment was made. However, the employees attached to the union of

the Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya has made representations

and in view of which though there was no profit the petitioner company

has agreed to make a bonus payment and entered into a Memorandum

of Understanding (R-1). The specific conditions applicable and the

persons entitled were clearly provided in the MOU. Paragraph 2 defined

the Eligible Employee as follows:

Parties agree that the Eligible Employees means permanent employees that have been in the employment in grades 1 to 7 of the Employer, confirmed on or before 1st April 2019 and in active

WRT-0451-2024

Page 5 of 10

service of the Employer on the date of paying the bonus payment referred to in paragraph (1) above. For the purpose of clarity, regardless of the active employment in the Employer during the period from 1st April 2019 to 31st March 2020, the employees under suspension as at the bonus payment date, and ex-employees who had retired or resigned prior to the date of the payment of the bonus shall not be eligible for the bonus payment referred to in paragraph (1) above.

6. The eligible employees for this bonus are those in active service of the

employer on the date of paying the bonus. It provides further that ex-

employees who had retired prior to the date of payment of the bonus

are not eligible. The bonus payment agreed to by this memorandum of

understanding is not the profit bonus referred to in clause 11 of the

collective agreement. Profit bonus as evident from clause 11.1 is solely

dependent on the profit made by the company during the previous

financial year. It is common ground that the company did not make

profit during the period 2019/2020. Thus, the payment of bonus under

clause 11 was not made. However, members of a certain union have

successfully negotiated to be paid bonus of one months salary with an

upper cap of Rs. 150,000/-. This is therefore an ad hoc, payment not

withstanding there being no profit that which has been agreed to, but

subject to the conditions specified therein. The eligible employees are

specifically stated and defined there in (at paragraph 2). The operative

date of payment is 8th April 2021. The primary determinate criteria is

that the employee being in active service on the date of paying the bonus

and excludes all employees who have retired prior to the date of

payment. This is confirmed by paragraph (c) of R-3, the inter office

communication.

7. According to R-3/P-8, it does refer to a payment of a bonus for the year

2019/2020. The said reference is no more than a narration of the

commencement of this negotiation. The petitioner and a union have

embarked upon a negotiation in respect of the non-payment of the bonus

WRT-0451-2024

Page 6 of 10

for 2019/2020. This entitlement under clause 11 of the collective

agreement is based on profit. In the absence of the profit as admitted by

both parties, a negotiation has resulted in making the payment of a

negotiated sum which is not the profit bonus. It is in this context that a

reference is made to 2019/2020. Upon the said negotiation, the decision

was to make the said payment of bonus on 08th April, 2021. Then, R-3

has specifically provided for the basis of the payment by sub-paragraph

(a) to (i) of the said inter-office communication. Paragraph (a) provides

that the entitlement is for those who are in active service as at 08th April,

2021. This is, once again, confirmed by paragraph (b), (d), and (e).

Paragraph (c) specifically provides that, employees who have

retired/resigned/under suspension/left from the services of the company

as at 08 April 2021 are not entitled to the payment of bonus. Thus it is

abundantly clear that those who are entitled are only such employees

specified therein who were in active employment as at 08th April, 2021.

This is also referable to the MOU (R-1/P-4), which also provides that the

employer has agreed to pay a months salary as bonus for eligible

employees of the employer on or about 08th April 2021. Thus the date of

payment is 08th April, 2021. Then paragraph 2 of the said MOU has

defined who an Eligible Employee which clearly provides that

notwithstanding the fact of such employee being in active employment

between 01.04.2019 to 31.03.2020, he or she shall not be eligible to

receive this bonus payment, if such employee has retired prior to the

date of payment.

8. It is relevant to note that there are three separate documents that are

relevant and brought to the notice of the arbitrator.

i. The collective agreement (R-4)

ii. The MOU dated 07.04.2021 (R-1)

iii. The inter office communication dated 06.04.2021

Accordingly, the sum total of the MOU, read with the inter-office

communication (R-1 and R-3) is that, to receive the said bonus payment,

it is mandatory that such employee be in active service as at 08.04.2021.

WRT-0451-2024

Page 7 of 10

The petitioner clearly does not satisfy this eligibility requirement. The

petitioner retired on 18.12.2019. The arbitrator in coming to his decision

failed to appreciate and consider this singular most important fact.

Accordingly, the arbitrator has failed to consider a very relevant fact in

making his determination.

9. That being so, the learned State Counsel appearing for the respondents

submitted that the bonus that was declared under the MOU was the

bonus due under clause 11 of the collective agreement and the due date

specified therein is 15.12.2020 and in accordance with clause 11 of P-

2, the 4th respondent is entitled and the arbitrator was correct in so

determining. I have hereinabove considered this aspect. Clearly the

bonus paid under the MOU is not, in form and in substance, the profit

based bonus contemplated by clause 11. If I may elaborate, in the

absence of a profit, there cannot be a determination of a bonus based

on profit. Thus, this is an ex gratia payment negotiated by a certain

union being a months salary with an upper cap of Rs. 150,000 that has

been paid as bonus on or about 08.04.2021. It is not something that

was earned by the employees, so to say. It is only if there is a profit an

employee may be entitled to a bonus based on clause 11 of P-2. It is thus

a different and distinct payment received and obtained by the employees

based on an independent negotiation that culminated in the MOU.

10. Certainly it is not the profit-based bonus under clause 11, but a

payment which those employees who were in active employment

negotiated and received more in the form of an ex gratia payment on the

benevolence of the employer. This stands to reason and logic. Employees

who were not in active service may claim and be entitled to a bonus

referrable and declared on the basis of profit of a previous year where

such employee was a part of the labour force who worked towards

making the said profit. However, if there is no profit, past employees can

have no such claim. The bonus paid, on the basis of the MOU and the

WRT-0451-2024

Page 8 of 10

inter-office communication (R-3), is not referable to past profit, which

deprives and disentitles any right of a past employee to claim such an

ex gratia bonus.

11. However, the arbitrator has concluded that the bonus payment made on

07.04.2021 was earned by the 4th respondent and is lawfully due to him

and is entitled to the same. The finding reads as follows;

2020 15 , 2021 07

.

.

12. In the above circumstance, the arbitrator has clearly failed to appreciate

and take into consideration the difference and the distinction between

the bonus paid under the MOU and that bonus contemplated under

clause 11 of the collective agreement. This is a clear failure to take in

the consideration a relevant fact. Accordingly, the award so made by the

arbitrator is unreasonable, ultra vires, and illegal to that extent. In these

circumstances, I would refer to the following passage from

Administrative law by Wade and Forsyth (11th Ed., at pg. 323, Relevant

and Irrelevant Considerations):

There are many cases in which a public authority has been held to have acted from improper motives or upon irrelevant considerations, or to have failed to take account of relevant considerations, so that its action is ultra vires and void. It is impossible to separate these cleanly from other cases of unreasonableness and abuse of power, since the court may use a variety of interchangeable explanations, as was pointed out by Lord Greene. Regarded collectively, these cases show the great importance of strictly correct motives and purposes. They show also how fallacious it is to suppose that powers conferred in unrestricted language confer unrestricted power.

In administrative justice, failure to take into account relevant considerations and taking into account irrelevant considerations would taint and nullify the decision as illegality which is an aspect of Wednesbury unreasonableness. Our attention has not been drawn to any analysis or consideration of these matters before a decision was made to indict the Petitioner. 13. The arbitrator has erred in interpreting and comprehending as to who

an Eligible Employee is. On this erroneous finding the arbitrator has

determined that the 4th respondent is an Eligible Employee within the

meaning of Paragraph 2 of the MOU (R-1). This may appear to be an

error of fact. However, the erroneous determination as to who an Eligible

Employee is, has resulted in the arbitrator proceeding to determine that

the 4th respondent is eligible and made the award accordingly. In the

normal course, an error of law will be readily be reviewed by courts.

However, courts will be slow and reluctant to review an error of fact.

That being so, if the error of fact is of such a fundamental nature that it

can cause the decision to be unlawful. In Constitutional and

Administrative Law (9th Edition) by Hilaire Barnett at Page 582

considering the errors of fact opined thus, The question to be asked,

therefore, is whether the mistake of fact is one which is central to the

decision makers power of decision. Only such crucial errors of fact will be

reviewed by the court. In addition, if a decision is reached on the basis of

facts for which there is no evidence, or based on essential facts which

have been proven wrong, or been misunderstood or ignored, the court will

quash the decision.

14. The arbitrator has upon considering the MOU and the collective

agreement considered the meaning of Eligible Employee. The arbitrator

had made a positive finding that 4th respondent is lawfully entitled to

the bonus paid on 07.04.2021 as he had earned the same. In coming to

this conclusion, the arbitrator has completely overlooked and failed to

appreciate that the bonus as agreed by the MOU and paid is not based

on profit. It is for all purposes and ex gratia payment made by the

WRT-0451-2024

Page 10 of 10

petitioner under the MOU. The arbitrator has thus completely

misconceived and erred when he decided so. This to my mind is a

fundamental error that has caused the decision to be unlawful to that

extent. It all boils down to the failure to appreciate and comprehend the

term Eligible Employee and the construction of the MOU along with

the collective agreement. Unless, such employee was an Eligible

Employee who was in active employment as at the date of the payment

of the bonus (April 2021), the arbitrator could not have lawfully awarded

the bonus payment as done by P-7. Accordingly, the said decision is

unreasonable and illegal which is an aspect of the Wednesbury

unreasonableness.

15. Thus, the impugned decision cannot be allowed to stand and accordingly,

the writ of certiorari as prayed for by prayer (d) is issued to quash the

impugned award P-7 of the arbitrator. Accordingly, the award made by

the 3rd respondent contained in the government gazette (extraordinary)

bearing No. 2356/35 dated 03.11.2023 marked P-7 is hereby quashed.

16. Application is allowed. However, I make no order as to costs.
