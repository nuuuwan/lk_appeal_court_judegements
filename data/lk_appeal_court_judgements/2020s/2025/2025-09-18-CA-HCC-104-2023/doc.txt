JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as "the Accused"), a relative of the

victim, Malwathanthrige Samantha Mallawa, was indicted before the High Court

of Puttalam on two initial charges. Subsequently, following the testimony of

Prosecution Witness No. 01 (PW 01), an additional charge was incorporated into

the indictment.

1. Count No. 1: That on or about 6th June 2009, the Appellant raped Waduge Ayesha

Maduwanthi Livera, who was under 16 years of age, thereby committing an offence

punishable under section 364(2)(e) of the Penal Code.

2. Count No. 2: That on or about 6th June 2009, the Appellant, with the intention of

scaring, threatened the physical well-being of Waduge Ayesha Maduwanthi

Livera, thereby committing the offence of criminal intimidation punishable under

section 486 of the Penal Code.

Additional Count -

Page 3 of 8

3. Count No. 3: That between 6th June 2009 and 9th June 2009, apart from the

incident mentioned in Count No. 1, the Appellant raped Waduge Ayesha

Maduwanthi Livera, who was under 16 years of age, thereby committing an offence

punishable under section 364(2)(e) of the Penal Code.

At the trial prosecution led the evidence through 14 witnesses and marking productions

P1-P3, and thereafter closed its case. The Accused, in his defence, made a dock statement

and called one witness.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge found the Accused guilty on

the first and third counts of rapping. Accordingly, for the first count, the Learned High

Court judge imposed 18 years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 10,000/- with a

default sentence of 6 months simple imprisonment and for the 3rd count, 18 years of

rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs. 10000 with a default sentence of 6 months

simple imprisonment. Furthermore, compensation in the sum of Rs. 30,000 carries in

default term of 01-year simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the afore-mentioned conviction and the sentence, the Accused has

preferred this appeal to this Court.

The following grounds for appeal were set out in the written submission.

1. That the learned Trial Judge misdirected herself when he concluded that there

were no contradictions or omissions in PW 1's evidence,

2. That the learned Trial Judge has failed to evaluate the credibility of PW 1's

evidence properly,

3. That the learned Trial Judge failed to appreciate that the Prosecution had failed

to discharge its burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

The facts pertaining to this case and the background to the incident may be set out briefly

as follows;

PW 01, Waduge Ayesha Maduwanthie Livera, testified that she was in Grade 5 at the

time of the alleged offence on 06.06.2009 and was 21 years old when giving evidence. She

stated that her parents were separated, and following her mother’s second marriage (PW

02), she resided at her grandmother’s (Kiri Amma’s) house (Maha Gedara) in

Mudalakkuliye, along with her maternal aunt (Punchi).

Page 4 of 8

The Accused, known to the witness as “Goppi Mama,” is the son of her maternal

grandmother’s sister (referred to as “Loku Amma”) and was a frequent visitor to the

household. On Poson Poya Day, 06.06.2009, the witness was left alone at Loku Amma’s

house while she was away preparing food for a dansala. During this time, the witness,

who had been sleeping unclothed, awoke to find the Accused beside her, touching her

inappropriately. PW 01 testified that the Accused then raped her and threatened to kill

her if she disclosed the incident.

PW 01 stated that following her grandmother’s illness, and she was in Colombo, her

grandmother’s house was closed, and she remained at the residence of her maternal

grandmother’s sister (“Loku Amma”). Despite no one being present at Maha Gedara, the

witness continued her routine of lighting the oil lamp there. On one such occasion, while

she was standing on a chair to light the lamp, the Accused approached her, held her by

the waist, instructed her not to shout, and placed her on the bed located in the same room.

At the time, the witness was dressed in a nightdress and pants, which the Accused

removed before raping her. The incident lasted approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The

witness experienced physical pain, pleaded with the Accused to stop, and attempted to

escape, but was unable to do so due to the Accused’s physical strength. The witness

further testified that the Accused threatened to kill her during the incident if she disclosed

this to anyone.

Following the incident near the oil lamp, PW 01 returned to her Loku Amma’s residence,

where her Punchi (aunt), her father’s elder brother’s daughter, and that relative’s

husband were present. On the same day, the Accused arrived at the house and asked the

witness to wash his shirt. Upon her refusal, the Accused slapped her. PW 01 disclosed

this incident to those present, her Punchi and her father’s elder brother’s daughter.

Subsequently, her Punchi contacted PW 01’s mother. The following day, on 10.06.2009,

PW 01’s mother arrived, inquired about the events, and took her to the Anamaduwa Police

Station to formally report the matter.

During cross-examination, learned counsel for the Accused asserted that the house where

PW 01 went to light the oil lamp was, in fact, her maternal uncle’s residence. The witness

agreed but clarified that the house was commonly referred to as her Kiri Amma’s house

or “Maha Gedara.” The Learned Counsel further suggested that the witness had gone to

Maha Gedara on the instruction of her Kiri Amma, which PW 01 denied. However, when

Page 5 of 8

confronted with her police statement indicating otherwise, she acknowledged that such a

statement had been recorded. Regarding the point of entry, counsel stated that the

witness had entered through the back door. PW 01 responded that she could not recall

precisely, noting that the door’s presence varied over time and that it was structurally

weak. The Learned Counsel also referred to a prior statement allegedly made by the

witness, suggesting that a similar incident had occurred three days earlier with the

accused. Which she has told the JMO. PW 01 stated she could not remember such a

statement. Finally, the defence proposed that PW 01 had not been disturbed by the alleged

incident until the Accused slapped her, and that her accusation was fabricated in

retaliation. PW 01 firmly rejected this suggestion.

According to the testimony of PW 11, JMO, Dr Deepthi Kumara Wijewardana, he has

examined the victim, PW 01, on 12. 06.2009, who was 13 years old and given a small

history regarding the incident, and according to the witness, a relative of the PW 01 has

raped her three times on 06.06.2009, 07.06.2009, and 08.06.2009. The witness claimed

that there is no mention of the accused's threat to the victim, PW 01. During the

examination, he observed that a bruise on the outside of PW 01’s hymen, the area outside

the vaginal opening, the base of the hymen was torn and was recovering, and her hymen

was partially dilated. The history given reconciles with the injuries, and the psychological

report states that she has an acute stress reaction following the abuse.

The learned High Court Judge, having considered the testimony of the aforementioned

witness, the dock statement of the Accused, and the evidence led by the defence, has

observed that PW-01’s testimony is spontaneous, consistent, reliable, and credible.

We are mindful of the observation made by Justice Takar J in Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai V.

State of Gujarat, AIR 1983 SC 753, which held that;

“By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photo graphic memory

and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape is replayed on the

mental screen. Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the

sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short time plan. A

witness is liable to get or mixed up when interrogated later on”.

According to the observation made by W.L. Ranjith Silva, J, in the case of D.Tikiribanda

v. Attorney General, 2010 BLR 92, held that;

“It is not surprising that there is an omission as distinct from a contradiction

(omissions on material points may amount to contradictions) in the evidence of the

victim as to the description/narration as to the offence and as to how the

preparation of the offence took place. A victim of sexual harassment is more often

than not compelled to make statements and give evidence in court. We must realize

that she’s not doing so for the pleasure of it but because she is compelled to do so.

Even though such complaints may appear to be voluntary yet they may not be

voluntary in the true sense. This is what is called secondary victimization. This is

somewhat like adding insult to injury. Any victim of rape or sexual harassment

would like to avoid the embarrassment of talking about, let alone repeating the

narration of such a shameful incident, if she could, Naturally it is reasonable and

realistic to believe that a victim of sexual harassment would be in a trauma before,

soon after the incident and sometimes even thereafter. In most of the Child abuse

and child rape cases the complainants are belated due to a sense of shame, fear,

embarrassment or ignorance. These incidents are brought to light invariably after

much questioning and persuasion. Mostly the victims of sexual harassment prefer

not to talk about the harrowing experience and would like to forget about the

incident as soon as possible (withdrawal symptom). The offenders should not be

allowed to capitalize or take mean advantage of these natural and inherent

weaknesses of small children. Under such circumstances it is only a counsel who

appears for an accused who cloud even suggest that such trivial contradictions

should be considered as decisive.”

Following observation made by Justice S. Thurairaja PC, J in the case AG v.

Daradadagamage Chandraratne, CA/85/2013, decided on 25.05.2018, His Lordship held

that;

“The last ground of appeal is that the evidence of the prosecutrix is unreliable.

As we discussed above the child was 11 years 10 months and 11 days at the time

of the incident, she gave evidence after 8 years and subjected to cross examination

fors a period more than 3 year.

Time and again Courts have discussed the acceptance of evidence of children of

tender ages. Our Judges are not there to test the memory of the witness, they are

Page 7 of 8

expected to find the actual fact and the truth. Witnesses are human being, they

are not memory machines nor robots to repeat the incident as it was. Further the

natural behaviour of human beings is to forget incidents, especially sad memories.

No one wants to re- visit painful moments and keep detailed memories with them.

We are also mindful most of our courts with due respect, are not child friendly. In

this case a child giving evidence after 8 years and subjected to cross examination

more than 3 years is sufficient to create certain contradictions in her testimony.It

is human nature. We carefully perused the evidence of the Prosecutrix and others

and found some contradictions inter-se and per-se. The learned trial Judge had

considered most of those and made his decision.”

Upon consideration of the testimony of PW 01, it is evident that the incident occurred

when she was approximately 10 years of age, and her evidence was recorded after a lapse

of 11 years at the trial. Notwithstanding the passage of time, her testimony remained

consistent and credible throughout. Minor contradictions were noted; however, they do

not materially affect the substance of the case or undermine the reliability of her account.

On the other hand, upon analysing the evidence of the Accused, it is noted that while he

denied the charges, he admitted to having struck the victim, attributing his actions to her

alleged stubborn behaviour. However, it is pertinent to consider the testimony of PW-5,

who stated that, while she was present, the Accused struck the victim and made certain

utterances.

උ: එයා අපේ පෙදරට ඇවිල්ලා හිටියා උපේ. එතප ාට පේ සමන්ත මල්ලවත් හිටියා. ඒ සමන්ත මල්ලව කියන

ප නා පාරක් ෙැහුවා පමයාට. එතප ාට ඒ ළමයා කිව්වා. උබ ෙැහුවාපන් මන් කියන්නේ මට රපු පේ කියලා

එච්චරයි දන්පන්. එච්චර තමා එයා කිව්පව්.

It is evident that this aspect of the testimony was not challenged by the Accused during

cross-examination. A careful assessment of PW-01’s evidence reveals no material

inconsistencies or grounds to question her credibility.

PW 11, JMO confirmed that, upon examination, injuries to the hymen were observed, and

it aligns with both legal standards and a compassionate understanding of the witness’s

circumstances.

When we peruse this evidence, we are of the view that the prosecution has proved the

case beyond a reasonable doubt; therefore, I do not intend to divert from the findings of

the Learned Trial Judge and thereby affirm the conviction and sentence.

This appeal is accordingly dismissed.
