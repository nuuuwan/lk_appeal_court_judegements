MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Plaintiff-Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the "Petitioner")

seeks to revise and set aside the impugned order of the High Court of Civil

Appeal-Colombo dated 23.01.2024, which refused the issuance of an interim

order to prevent the Defendant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred

to as the "Respondent") from interfering with the peaceful possession and

management of the premises, "Eswara Lodge."

The Petitioner's claim is grounded on several significant facts. It is submitted

that the Petitioner and his predecessors have been the owners of the property

located at 169, Sea Street, Colombo, utilized as a guesthouse under the name

"Eswara Lodge." In or around 2008, the Petitioner permitted the Respondent to

manage "Eswara Lodge" under an oral agreement. The terms of this agreement

included a monthly payment of Rs. 85,000/- and an initial deposit of Rs. 2.5

million. Disputes later arose when the Respondent failed to adhere to the

agreed terms, prompting the Petitioner to institute proceedings in the District

Court case DSP/375/2023. The relief sought included declarations of

termination of the agreement, injunctions restraining the Respondent, and

damages. The District Court initially issued an enjoining order, but upon the

Respondent's objections, the interim injunction application was dismissed on

20-10-2023. Subsequently, the Petitioner appealed to the High Court of Civil

Appeal, which refused to grant the interim relief on 23-01-2024. Aggrieved by

this decision, the Petitioner has filed the present revision application, asserting

errors in law and fact in the High Court's judgment.

4

This court on 07.02.2024 granted the interim relief prayed for in prayer (c) by

the Petitioner, seeking to preserve the status quo pending the final

determination of the substantive matter of this application.

The Petitioners Contention

The Petitioner asserts that the Respondent initially entered into possession of

the premises as a licensee under an oral agreement made in 2008, wherein the

Respondent agreed to manage "Eswara Lodge" on the Petitioners behalf. This

arrangement, coupled with a monthly commission of Rs. 85,000/- and a deposit

of Rs. 2.5 million, clearly established the subordinate and temporary nature of

the Respondents occupancy. Under such circumstances, the Petitioner

contends that the Respondent is legally estopped, as per Section 116 of the

Evidence Ordinance, from disputing the Petitioners title to the property. The

Respondents subsequent assertions of independent ownership or control over

the premises are inconsistent with this estoppel and therefore lack merit.

The Petitioner further argues that the High Court failed to properly evaluate the

balance of convenience, which heavily favors maintaining the status quo to

prevent further harm to the Petitioner. By denying interim relief, the High Court

permitted a situation where irreparable damage could occur, including the

disruption of business operations and potential destruction of the Petitioners

property rights. Additionally, the Petitioner highlights the Respondents lack of

clean hands, evidenced by contradictory claims regarding the ownership and his

role in the propertys management. The Respondents refusal to adhere to the

terms of the oral agreement and subsequent actions, including purported

5

claims of enhanced rights under fabricated circumstances, undermine his

credibility and render him ineligible for equitable relief.

Moreover, it is submitted that the dismissal of the Petitioner's application by

both the District Court and the High Court contradicts established judicial

precedents set by superior courts in Sri Lanka.

The Respondents Contention

The Respondent contends that the property in question was transferred to

Dedigama Gold Loan Centre (Pvt) Ltd. in 2021, claiming that this entity is the

rightful owner, and the Respondent has been in lawful occupation as a licensee

under this ownership arrangement. The Respondent further alleges that the

Petitioner has deliberately withheld critical information regarding the shared

ownership of the property, arguing that the Petitioner's failure to disclose this

fact constitutes a material suppression intended to mislead the Court.

Additionally, the Respondent claims that the management agreement relied

upon by the Petitioner is a mere draft, unsigned and therefore unenforceable,

rendering the Petitioner's reliance on this document legally baseless.

The Respondent also highlights that the Petitioner's application lacks the

exceptional circumstances required to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the

Court of Appeal, suggesting that the proper legal avenue should have been an

appeal to the Supreme Court as per established legal procedures. The

Respondent maintains that the Petitioner's actions are vexatious and designed

solely to obtain interim relief through alternative means, circumventing the

established appellate process. This argument is presented by the

6

Respondentscontention that the Petitioner has sought relief based on

questionable documents while ignoring the equitable principles of law, which

require full disclosure and clean hands from parties seeking such remedies.

Observations of the Court

The Respondent's assertion of lawful occupation under Dedigama Gold Loan

Centre (Pvt) Ltd. is fundamentally inconsistent with his own admission of

initially entering the premises under the Petitioner's license. This duality

undermines his credibility and invites the application of Section 116 of the

Evidence Ordinance, which unequivocally estops a party from denying the title

of the individual under whom they were licensed to occupy.

The refusal of interim relief by the lower courts has critically disrupted the

status quo, creating a situation where the Respondents potential re-entry and

unauthorized interference could irreparably harm the Petitioner's peaceful

possession and ongoing business operations at "Eswara Lodge. This potential

harm is further magnified by the economic and reputational losses the

Petitioner is likely to endure if the Respondent is permitted to act contrary to

the agreement under which he initially entered the property.

The Petitioner has effectively demonstrated a strong prima facie case through

comprehensive documentary evidence, including valuation reports and detailed

police complaints. These documents not only substantiate the Petitioner's

claims but also reveal the Respondent's actions as inconsistent and lacking in

good faith. The Respondent's refusal to formalize the management agreement,

despite ample opportunity, indicates a deliberate intent to exploit the informal

arrangement for his benefit, further emphasizing his lack of equitable standing.

7

Equity and fairness weigh heavily in favour of the Petitioner. The Respondent's

inconsistent positions, marked by conflicting claims regarding his legal status

and obligations under the agreement, highlight bad faith conduct.

Given the overarching legal principles and the compelling evidence presented, it

is evident that the Petitioner's entitlement to interim relief is both legally and

equitably justified. Ensuring that the Respondent is restrained from further

interference will not only protect the Petitioner's possessory and business rights

but also uphold the integrity of judicial processes designed to prevent misuse

and exploitation.

Conclusion

Having carefully considered the submissions, evidence, and legal principles, this

Court finds that the Petitioner has successfully demonstrated that the

impugned order of the High Court of Civil Appeal dated 23-01-2024 is erroneous

and requires revision. The Respondents inconsistent claims and conduct are

not only contrary to legal principles but also undermine the equity and fairness

essential in proceedings.

The Respondents conduct, including his attempts to challenge the Petitioners

title despite entering the premises as a licensee, is legally untenable at this

point where the trial has not even commenced in the District Court. His actions

have disrupted the peaceful possession of the property and exposed the

Petitioner to significant risks. These circumstances underscore the necessity of

interim measures to protect the Petitioners rights and preserve the status quo.

8

Judicial precedents, such as Pounds v. Ganegama(40 NLR 73)and other

authoritative cases, affirm that interim relief is critical to maintain stability and

prevent further prejudice in disputes involving possession. The Petitioners have

satisfied the sequential tests that warrant the grant of the interim releif prayed

in the District Court. The principles of equity demand that the Respondent,

having acted in bad faith, be restrained from causing further harm.

Accordingly, this Court grants the relief sought under prayer (b) of the Petition,

revising and setting aside the order of the High Court of Civil Appeal dated 23-

01-2024 marked X 1 and therefore, the interim relief prayed for in prayer (e)

to the Petition filed in the said High Court by thePetitioner is granted.

Application allowed. No costs.
