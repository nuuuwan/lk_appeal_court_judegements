RESPONDENTS

4

Sri Lanka Principals Services published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1885/31

dated 22.10.2014 marked as P9. The Petitioners state that in terms of P9, teachers

belonging to the Sri Lanka Teachers Service who possess the requisite qualifications

and have been duly confirmed in the service are eligible to sit for the Limited

Competitive Examination. Accordingly, the Petitioners submitted their applications

(P10(a) to P10(g)). After successfully passing the Limited Competitive Examination,

the Petitioners were called for general and structured interviews by the Secretary to the

Ministry of Education, the 2nd Respondent, by the letters marked as P11(a) to P11(f). In

terms of the letters calling for interviews, only those officers who satisfy the basic

qualifications at the general interview are to be called for the structured interviews. The

Petitioners, having faced the general interview, were thereafter not permitted to appear

for the structured interview on the ground that Pirivena teachers do not belong to the

Sri Lanka Teachers Service and therefore they are not eligible to apply for the post.

Being aggrieved by the said decision, the Petitioners invoked the Writ jurisdiction of

this Court seeking the following substantive relief, inter alia,

b. Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus compelling and directing one

or more or all the 1st to 12th Respondents to call the Petitioners to the structured

interviews for recruitment to Grade III of the Sri Lanka Principals' Service and

appoint them to Grade III of the Sri Lanka Principals Service.

The argument of the Petitioners is that the predecessors of the 2nd Respondent, by letter

dated 21.04.2015 marked as P2, had informed all the Zonal Educational Directors to

5

apply the Constitution of the Sri Lanka Teachers Service to the Pirivena teachers. The

Petitioners state that, later, they were absorbed into the Sri Lanka Teachers Service

(P3(a) to P3(c)). Thereafter, the promotions (P5(a) to P5(g)) and salary conversions of

the Petitioners (P6(a) to P6(l)) were done according to the Constitution of the Sri Lanka

Teachers Service. Furthermore, the Petitioners carried out exam duties of the C.G.E

O/L and C.G.E A/L exams, which are performed only by the government teachers

(P7(a) to P7(g)). Therefore, the 2nd Respondents refusal to allow the Petitioners to face

the structured interview on the basis that they do not belong to the Sri Lanka Teachers

Service is illegal, unlawful and ultra vires.

The contention of the learned DSG appearing for the Respondents is that, the Petitioners

does not fall within the category of teachers under the Teachers Service Minutes

published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1885/38 dated 23.10.2914 marked as R1

and the letter marked as P2 merely authorise the Provincial Directors of Education to

adopt the Service Minutes of Sri Lanka Teachers Service marked as R1 for the purpose

of promotion of Pirivena teachers as well. As the Petitioners do not belong to the

Teachers Service, they have not fulfilled the necessary qualifications to sit for the

structured interview to join the Sri Lanka Principals Service.

In terms of the Gazette notification calling for applications for the Limited Competitive

Examination for Recruitment to Grade III of the Sri Lanka Principals Service, marked

as P8, and the Service Minutes of the Sri Lanka Principals Service, marked ad P9,

teachers belonging to the Sri Lanka Teachers Service who have been confirmed in

6

their appointments and who satisfy the prescribed qualifications are eligible to sit for

the said competitive examination. Now the question before this Court is whether the

Petitioners are teachers of the Sri Lanka Teachers Service. The Petitioners contention

is that they are Pirivena teachers who were subsequently absorbed into the Sri Lanka

Teachers Service. In formulating this argument, the Petitioners rely on the letter

marked as P2 and the letter marked as P3(a) to P3(c), the letter of promotions (P5(a) to

P5(g)) and salary conversions (P6(a) to P6(l)) of the Petitioners and the fact that they

performed C.G.E O/L and C.G.E A/L exam duties which are performed only by

government teachers. According to the Petitioners contention, in terms of the letter

marked as P2, Pirivena teachers belong to the Sri Lanka Teachers Service. However,

the learned DSG argues that P2 merely provides that the Service Minutes of the Sri

Lanka Teachers Service are to be applied solely for the purposes of promotions and

the payment of salary arrears to Pirivena teachers, and does not apply the other

provisions in the Service Minutes that they belong in the Service to Pirivena teachers

for the reasons mentioned forthwith. The letter marked as P2 is reproduced as follows,

35/2014 (i)

2014.12.05

.

02.

.

When examining the letter marked as P2, it is clear that it refers to the Circular No.

35/2014(i), which confirms that the promotion procedure applicable to the officers in

the Sri Lanka Teachers Service has been established through the adoption of the Sri

Lanka Teachers Service Constitution, i.e., the Service Minutes of Lanka Teachers

Service marked as R1. It further indicates that the same procedure should be applied in

affecting the promotions of Pirivenacharyas and accordingly calculate their salaries.

The Petitioners argue that they were absorbed into the Sri Lanka Teachers Service as

evident by the letter marked as P3(a) to P3(c), given promotions as per P5(a) to P5(g)

and salary conversions were also done accordingly as per P6(a) to P6(l) in terms of the

Minutes of the Sri Lanka Teachers Service. The Petitioners further argue that they

made complaints to the Ombudsman (P13) and the Ombudsman called for reports on

the grievance of the Petitioners from the 2nd Respondent, to which the 2nd Respondent

furnished a report marked as P15 stating that the 1st Petitioner does not belong to the

Sri Lanka Teachers Service. Thereafter, the Ombudsman once again called for a

further report from the 2nd Respondent by letter marked as P16, inquiring on what basis

the 2nd Respondent has decided that the 1st Petitioner does not belong to the Sri Lanka

Teachers Service. In reply to the letter marked as P16, the Zonal Education Director,

Bandarawela, has sent a letter dated 16.02.2021 marked as P18 to the Ombudsman

8

stating that it has been inadvertently stated that the 1st Petitioner belongs to the Sri

Lanka Teachers Service in the salary adjustment letters. Therefore, the Petitioners

argue that such a position is completely incorrect and contrary to law as they have been

recognised as teachers of the Sri Lanka Teachers Service as reflected in the documents

marked as P3(a) to P7(g). The learned DSG appearing for the Respondents drew the

attention of this Court to the letters marked as P3(c) and P5(b), which the Petitioners

rely upon to assert that they have been absorbed into the Sri Lanka Teachers Service

and subsequently promoted in the same service. However, it is observed by this Court

that the said letters refer specifically that the 2nd Petitioner was absorbed to the Sri

Lanka Pirivena Teachers Service ( ) and the 1st Petitioner

was promoted in the Sri Lanka Pirivenacharya Service ( )

and not absorbed or promoted in/to the Sri Lanka Teachers Service.

In the letter marked as P18, sent by the Zonal Director of Education, Bandarawela, to

the Ombudsman states that the 1st Petitioner is in the Pirivenacharya Service, and the

reference to the Sri Lanka Teachers Service in the salary adjustment letter marked as

P4 was an error due to the standard format being used when preparing such letters. The

relevant parts of the letter marked as P18 is reproduced as follows,

* 2014.10.23 1885/38

//10//03 2016/06/11

The Petitioners have neither produced the appointment letter of the 1st Petitioner

numbered //10//03 dated 11.06.2016 and its amendment nor produced the

letter //10//03 dated 03.07.2017 stated in the letter marked as P18 to this

Court. The letter //10//03 had been referred to in the letter marked as P3(a).

However, in terms of the letter marked as P3(a), the 1st Petitioner has been placed in

Grade 2-II in Teachers Service. In the letter marked as P18, the Zonal Director of

Education, Bandarawela, has clearly stated that the 1st Petitioner is a Parivenacharya

serving in the Parivenacharya Service. By letter dated 23.02.2021, marked as R3, the

Ombudsman had informed the 1st Petitioner that, based on the facts set out in the letter

marked as P18, it appears that the 1st Petitioner belongs to the category of

Parivenacharyas and, therefore, he cannot further intervene in the matter. Apart from

10

the letters marked as P3(a) to P7(g), the Petitioners have not provided any document to

establish that the Pirivena teachers have been absorbed into the Sri Lanka Teachers

Service. In the absence of such clear evidence, it is the view of this Court that neither

the letter marked as P2 nor letters marked as P3(a) to P7(g) support the position that the

Petitioners were, in fact, absorbed into the Sri Lanka Teachers Service.

Nevertheless, this Court will now proceed to consider whether the Petitioners fall within

the scope of the Service Minutes of the Sri Lanka Teachers Service marked R1. When

this matter was taken up for argument, the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners

argued that in terms of Section 2(b) of the Pirivena Education Act, No. 64 of 1979, the

objective is to provide educational facilities in a Buddhist environment. In addition to

the general qualifications required for a teacher, Pirivena teachers must possess the

suitable qualifications necessary to provide education in a Buddhist environment.

Accordingly, the appointments of Pirivena teachers are made by the Secretary to the

Ministry of Education on the recommendation of the Kruthyadhikari, as evident from

the appointment letters marked as P1(a) to P1(d).

The argument of the learned DSG appearing for the Respondents is that the teachers

governed by the Service Minutes of the Sri Lanka Teachers Service marked R1, are

public officers who discharge the functions stipulated in Section 6.1 of the Service

Minutes marked as R1. In terms of Section 6.1 of R1, the duties of the teachers serve

in all grades are as follows,

11

Performing duties relevant to learning- teaching activities in Government

schools, activities relevant to conduct national level and other examinations

relevant to school education, activities relevant to school sports and other subject

parallel activities and activities, decided by the government to have implemented

at school level relevant to the education process.

The learned DSG further argued that, in terms of Section 24 of the Pirivena Education

Act, the Pirivena teachers are appointed by the Manager/ Kruthyadikara Wahanse of

the Piriven, subject to the approval of the Pirivena Education Board and not by the

Service Minutes of the Sri Lanka Teachers Service marked R1. Further, in terms of

R1, the teachers of the Sri Lanka Teachers Service are appointed by the Secretary to

the Ministry of Education in exercise of the delegated powers of the Public Service

Commission. When taking into consideration the provisions of the Pirivena Education

Act, Section 24(c) clearly provides that the Manager of a Pirivena has the power to

appoint or discontinue, subject to the approval of the Board, the Principal and teachers

of the Pirivena. In the Service Minutes, marked as R1 it is also clearly laid down that

the appointing authority is the Public Service Commission or the Secretary of the

Ministry of Education to whom the powers are delegated by the Public Service

Commission. Therefore, this Court cannot agree with the contention of the learned

Counsel appearing for the Petitioner that the Pirivena teachers are appointed by the

Secretary to the Ministry of Education.

12

The Service Minutes Marked as R1 do not define the term teacher. However, in terms

of Section 26(1) of the Pirivena Education Act, a person shall not be eligible for

appointment as a teacher of a Pirivena unless he is a bhikkhu. However, the proviso to

Section 26(1) states that where a bhikkhu is not available for appointment as a teacher

in respect of such subjects as may be specified by the Director-General, a qualified

layman may be appointed as a teacher of a Pirivena. When considering the general

responsibilities of the Teachers Service and duties stipulated in the Service Minutes

marked as R1, they revolve around learning and teaching activities of Government

schools to create parity through a higher quality education according to the National

Education policy. On the other hand, a Pirivena Education aims to provide formal

education primarily to Bhikkhus and male lay students over the age of fourteen who

seek learning in a Buddhist environment to provide a well-rounded education grounded

in Buddhist values, to preserve and promote religious teachings and cultural heritage,

and to instil moral discipline and intellectual development among students. Considering

the above facts, this Court cannot agree with the learned Counsel appearing for the

Petitioners' argument that Pirivena teachers perform the same functions as teachers who

belong to the Teachers Service.

Furthermore, the learned DSG appearing for the Respondents drew the attention of this

Court to the letter dated 31.08.2022 marked as R4 issued by the Director General of

Establishment to the Secretary to the Public Service Commission stating that Pirivena

teachers are not public officers. The letter marked as R4 expressly states that, although

13

certain policy decisions made in relation to the Public Officers may apply to the

Pirivena teachers by introducing them as special regulations, generally, they do not

apply to Pirivena teachers. Considering all the above-stated facts and circumstances,

this Court is of the view that the Petitioners are not entitled to the Writ of Mandamus

as prayed for in prayer (b) of the Petition. Accordingly, this Writ Application is

dismissed. No costs ordered.

Application dismissed.
