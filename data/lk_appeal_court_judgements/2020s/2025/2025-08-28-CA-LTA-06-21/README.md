The Intervenient-Petitioner-Respondents, being former students of the Ghaffooriya

management committee for the said college. In response, the Applicant submitted an

application to the Wakf Tribunal under Case No. WT/273/2020.

Subsequently, on 22.01.2021, the Tribunal issued notice to the Petitioner, indicating that

the Director had filed an application requesting the Tribunal to consider the proposal

submitted by the All-Boys Association. As stated in the petition, when the matter was

taken up on 13.02.2021, counsel for the Petitioner raised a preliminary objection

regarding the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

However, due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tribunal did not

convene for a period of time. According to the Petitioner, on 04.12.2021, the Intervenient-

Petitioner-Respondents submitted an application seeking an interim order. The Tribunal

subsequently issued the said interim order.

This application has been filed challenging that interim order. Meanwhile, the Petitioners

have also initiated a writ application WRT-293/21 seeking the following reliefs.
