JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as "the Accused") was charged

before the High Court of Mathale with committing the offence of Grave Sexual

Abuse against a minor, Don Amith Dilshan Wanigasekara, on or around April 1,

2011. This offence is punishable under Section 365B(2)(b) of the Penal Code, as

amended by Act No. 22 of 1995, Act No. 29 of 1998, and Act No. 16 of 2006.

During the trial, the prosecution presented evidence through four witnesses and

submitted productions marked P1 to P2, following which the prosecution closed its

case. Upon the conclusion of the prosecution's case, the Accused opted to make a

dock statement in his defence.

Following the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge, by judgment

dated April 4, 2023, found the Accused guilty of the charge. Consequently, the

Accused was sentenced to seven years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs.

5,000/-, with a default sentence of two months' simple imprisonment. Additionally,

the Accused was ordered to pay compensation in the sum of Rs. 150,000/-, failing

which he would serve a further term of twelve months' simple imprisonment.

Aggrieved by the aforementioned conviction and sentence, the Accused has

preferred this appeal before this Court. The grounds of appeal advanced by the

Accused are as follows:

1. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the ambiguous nature of PW

1s testimony, the internal inconsistencies within his evidence, the impact of these

inconsistencies on the core of the prosecution's case, and the contradictions

between the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the uncertainty and

contradictions within the testimony of PW 1, particularly given the absence of

eyewitnesses in this case. Furthermore, the reliability of PW 1s testimony remains

uncorroborated by the accounts of other prosecution witnesses.

3. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the Accuseds reasons for

making such allegations against him during the cross-examination.

Page 4 of 7

The facts and the circumstances are briefly summarised as follows:

According to the testimony of Prosecution Witness No. 01 (PW 01), Don Amith

Dilshan Wanigasekara, who was 7 years and 10 months old at the time he was

residing with his grandmother, Prosecution Witness No. 04 (PW 04), Chandra

Kumari Wanigasekara, near the doctors quarters. On April 1, 2011, while

collecting tamarind near the quarters, the Accused approached him and directed

him toward another tree across the way, encouraging him to gather tamarind from

there. However, on the opposite side, there was no tamarind tree, only a toilet and

another house. As PW 01 attempted to return, the Accused allegedly grabbed him

forcefully. PW 01 further testified that the Accused then removed both his own

clothing and that of the witness, and, while standing, placed his male organ

between the childs thighs.

During cross-examination, counsel for the Accused questioned PW 01 regarding

his statement to the police, which indicated that the incident had taken place after

he returned from school. In response, PW 01 categorically denied attending school

on the morning of the incident. He clarified that he had been playing cricket and

first came into contact with the Accused later that morning.

The Learned Counsel for the Accused also highlighted a discrepancy between PW

01s testimony and the statement recorded by Prosecution Witness No. 03 (PW 03),

the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO), concerning the nature of the incident.

According to the JMOs record, PW 01 had described the incident as having

occurred while he was in a sleeping position. However, during his testimony, PW

01 disputed this account and consistently maintained that the offence took place

while he was standing, with the Accused placing his male organ between the

victims thighs.

Dr. Ajith Samantha Jayasena, the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO), appeared as

Prosecution Witness No. 03 (PW 03) and testified regarding his medical

examination of PW 01. He stated that there were no observable external injuries,

no indications of sexually transmitted infections, and no evidence of anal

Page 5 of 7

penetration. Based on the history provided by PW 01, the Accused had allegedly

positioned himself in a sleeping posture, then spat and rubbed his male organ

between the childs thighs.

In his dock statement, the Accused asserted that PW 01 had a known history of

stealing from the doctors quarters, and that one of the doctors had instructed him

to apprehend the child if such conduct continued. Acting on this instruction, the

Accused claimed he attempted to confine PW 01 in the toilet. During the course of

this incident, according to the Accused, PW 01 directed offensive language toward

him.

The Learned High Court Judge noted that, while certain inconsistencies were

present in the evidence, they were not of such a nature as to raise a reasonable

doubt concerning the prosecutions case. The Judge further observed that there

was no credible basis to conclude that PW 01 had fabricated the allegations against

the Accused. Despite the identified contradictions, the Learned Judge accepted the

testimonies of the prosecution witnesses as having established the charge beyond

a reasonable doubt.

At this juncture, it is pertinent to reproduce the observations made by D. A. Desai J. with

regard to how the court approaches the discrepancies and infirmities pointed out in the

evidence in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh v. M.K. Anthony, reported in Supreme

Court Journal 1984 (2) page 498,

While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be whether the evidence

of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth. Once that impression is

formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the court to scrutinize the evidence more

particularly keeping in view the deficiencies, draw-backs and infirmities pointed out in

the evidence as a whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general

tenor of the evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of the

evidence is shaken as to render it unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies on trivial

matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach by taking sentences

torn out of context here or there from the evidence, attaching importance to some technical

Page 6 of 7

error committed by the investigating officer not going to the root of the matter would not

ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a whole. If the court before whom the witness

gives evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion about the general tenor of evidence

given by the witness, the appellate court which had not this benefit will have to attach

due weight to the appreciation of evidence by the trial court and unless there are reasons

weighty and formidable it would not be proper to reject the evidence on the ground of

minor variations or infirmities in the matter of trivial details. Even honest and truthful

witnesses may differ in some details unrelated to the main incident because power of

observation, retention and reproduction differ with individuals.

Having With regard to the foregoing legal principles, a careful examination of the

prosecution's evidenceparticularly the testimony of PW 01reveals that the

defence has raised substantial doubts concerning the alleged act of Grave Sexual

Abuse committed by the Accused. It appears that the Learned High Court Judge

did not adequately or correctly evaluate the evidence provided by PW 01, thereby

failing to address the inconsistencies and contradictions that bear upon the

credibility of the prosecutions case

When we pursue the evidence of PW 01, we can see major contradictions in his evidence,

as he is not consistent throughout.

It is well established in our jurisprudence that, in cases involving sexual abuse, a

conviction may be sustained solely on the testimony of the victim, provided that

such testimony is found to be credible and compelling. However, in the present

case, the contradictions and inconsistencies in the evidence of PW 01 underscore

the necessity for corroboration. The absence of supporting evidence raises concerns

about the reliability of the prosecutions case. It is apparent that the Learned High

Court Judge failed to conduct a balanced and comprehensive evaluation of all the

available facts and circumstances.

In the present case, the victim, PW 01, presented two conflicting accounts

regarding his physical position during the alleged incident, and further

discrepancies arose concerning his school attendance on the day in question. These

Page 7 of 7

inconsistencies cast doubt on the reliability of his testimony and raise legitimate

concerns as to whether the Court can safely rely upon it. The Learned High Court

Judge failed to adequately address and assess these contradictions in the victims

evidence. I am of the view that this contradiction strikes at the very root of the

case and materially affects the credibility of the prosecutions evidence.

Accordingly, we find that the testimony of PW 01 does not provide a sufficient

basis to establish the guilt of the Accused. The Prosecution has failed to prove,

beyond a reasonable doubt, that a sexual act was committed against the victim

solely on the strength of PW 01s evidence.

In light of the foregoing, the conviction and sentence imposed by the Learned High

Court Judge are hereby set aside. The Accused is acquitted of the charge on which

he was convicted.

Appeal Allowed.
