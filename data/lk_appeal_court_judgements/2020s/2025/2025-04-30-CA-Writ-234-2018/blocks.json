Edmund De Silva had passed away in November 1991, and thereafter Nihal De Silvas widow and three minor children (the present Petitioners) had informed the LRC of the deaths and submitted documentation to establish their entitlement. In 2006, the Ministry of Agriculture informed the Petitioners that the allocated land was subject to a claim by the Sri Dalada Maligawa and was being investigated by a Presidential Commission. However, findings of this commission had never been communicated to the Petitioners. Subsequent to an inquiry held during the pendency of the current writ application, the Diyawadana Nilame of the Dalada Maligawa had clarified that they are only claiming compensation and not possession of the said land. As such it appears that the claim of Sri Dalada Maligawa is no longer an impediment to alienating the land. The Petitioners prior to filing of the present case had expressed willingness to accept alternate land instead of the land allocated and although some suggestions had been made regarding suitable land, this compromise has also failed. The Petitioners have also submitted that after the judgment in CA/Writ/1537/83 Muthugala Estate was handed over by the JEDB to Kurunegala Plantations PLC. The Petitioners have further alleged that the transfer had not been Gazetted and has been done without compliance with proper procedure.
