JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused- Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) along with

another was indicted before the High Court of Vavuniya on the charge of

committing the offence of murder of one Sadasivam Kuganandan on 28.01.2013,

punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

The Prosecution led the evidence through fourteen witnesses and marking

productions from P1 to P9 and thereafter closed its case. The Accused in their

defence made dock statements. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High

Court Judge by judgment dated 01.06.2023 found the 1st Accused guilty of murder

and imposed the death sentence and acquitted the 2nd Accused.

Being aggrieved by the afore-mentioned conviction and the sentence, the 1st

Accused has preferred this appeal to this Court.

The following are the grounds of appeal as pleaded by the Accused;

1. Conviction is wholly unsafe in view of the uncertainty and ambiguity attached to

the blood sample alleged to have been taken from the deceaseds body.

2. Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the inherent weakness of the

prosecution case.

3. Learned Trial Judge has erred in law by examining the defence evidence in the

light of the prosecution evidence which tantamounts to shifting the burden of proof

to the appellant.

4. Prosecution has not eliminated the possibility of an accident being the reason for

the death of the deceased.

5. PW03 is not a credible witness on whose testimony the conviction is based on.

Page 3 of 9

6. Items of circumstantial evidence are wholly inadequate to support the conviction.

7. Learned Trial Judge has failed to apply the principles governing the evaluation of

circumstantial evidence cases.

The facts and the circumstances are as follows:

The deceased was a three-wheeler driver and according to the evidence, the wife

of the deceased had received a call at around 2 AM on 29.01.2013 stating that the

deceased had met with an accident. As per the evidence, the deceased was lying

dead near the Marakarampalai School, and the Police were already there when

the wife and the son of the deceased reached the scene.

Later, the two Accused, who were also three-wheeler drivers, were arrested along

with their three-wheelers NPYQ 4624 and NPYJ 9288. The three-wheeler bearing

number NPYQ 4624 had blood stains on the black carpet near the driver's seat

and, number plate.

According to the medical evidence, the injuries of the deceased could have been

caused by a blunt force or the deceased would have had a heavy fall during which

that injury could have occurred.

The blood sample marked 01 was the blood sample of the deceased and samples

marked from 02 to 05 were the blood samples found from the scene. These

samples were sent for DNA testing through the Magistrate Court. According to

the expert evidence, the DNA report reveals that the blood samples found from

the scene are consistent with originating from a single source and match with the

blood samples of the deceased.

Page 4 of 9

The Learned High Court Judge convicted and sentenced the Accused to death

based on the DNA report that the blood found in the three-wheeler of the 1st

Accused was of the deceased.

When we consider the evidence of P12, Attanayake, he has stated that he took the

blood samples from the place where the deceaseds body was lying. He specifically

stated that he never obtained any blood samples from the deceaseds body. But the

Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself that the sample was from the body

of the deceased. The particular DNA report was based on the blood sample of the

deceased. However, there is no evidence to show that the blood samples were

obtained from the deceaseds body.

There is no direct evidence against the Accused. This case is solely based on

circumstantial evidence.

Thus, it is pertinent to consider the rules governing the cases of circumstantial

evidence.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, The Law of Evidence, Page 25:

In Sri Lanka, the rule that in order to justify the inference of guilt from

purely circumstantial evidence, the incriminating facts must be

incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation

on any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt, has been

repeatedly emphasized and applied by our courts. Thus, in a case based

entirely on circumstantial evidence, the fact that the deceased was last seen

alive in the company of the deceased would not of itself justify a conviction,

where the exact time of death is not established, nor would the fact that the

Page 5 of 9

accused subsequently attempted to dispose of a weapon which might have

caused the injuries on the deceased. Again, where the only evidence against

two accused, indicted for murder, was that they had the opportunity of

committing the offence either jointly or individually and that after the

discovery of the body, they absconded and were not apprehended for three

years, the verdict of guilty was held to be unreasonable.

In B.R.R.A. Jagath Pramawansha v. The Attorney General, CA Appeal No.

173/2005, decided on 19.03.2009, His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew held that;

The case for the prosecution depended on circumstantial evidence.

Therefore it is necessary to consider the principles governing cases of

circumstantial evidence. In King v. Abeywicrama 44 NLR 254 Soertsz J

remarked thus: In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence

the Jury must be satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt

of the accused and inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of this

innocence.

In King v. Appuhamy 46 NLR 128 Kueneman J held thus: in order to

justify the inference of guilt from purely circumstantial evidence, the

inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused

and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable-hypothesis the that

of his guilt.

In Podisingho v. King 53 NLR 49 Dias J remarked thus: That in a case of

circumstantial evidence it is the duty of the trial Judge to tell the Jury that

Page 6 of 9

such evidence must be totally inconsistent with the innocence of the accused

and must only be consistent with his guilt.

Having regard to the principles laid down in the above judicial decisions, I

hold that in a case of circumstantial evidence, if an inference of guilt is to

be drawn, such an inference must be the one and only irresistible and

inescapably conclusion that the accused committed the offence. When the

evidence adduced at the trial is considered, the one and only irresistible and

inescapable conclusion that can be arrived at is that the accused committed

the murder of Prema Jayawardwene.

His Lordship Justice Aluwihare, PC, in Junaideen Mohamed Haaris v. Attorney

General, SC Appeal 118/17, Decided on 09.11.2018 held that:

Before I consider the facts of the case and the legal issues raised in this

appeal, it should be borne in mind that the prosecution relied entirely on

circumstantial evidence to establish the charges, for the reason that there

were no eyewitnesses to substantiate any of the charges against the

Accused-Appellant. Thus, it was incumbent on the prosecution to establish

that the circumstances the prosecution relied on, are consistent only with

the guilt of the accused appellant and not with any other hypothesis.

Regard should be had to a set of principles and rules of prudence, developed

in a series of English decisions, which are now regarded as settled law by

our courts. The two basic principles are-

i. The inference sought to be drawn must be consistent with all the

proved facts, if it is not, then the inference cannot be drawn.

Page 7 of 9

ii. The proved facts should be such that they exclude every reasonable

inference from them, save the one to be drawn. If they do not exclude

other reasonable inferences, then there must be a doubt whether the

inference sought to be drawn is correct (per Watermeyer J. in R vs.

Blom 1939 A.D. 188)

In light of the above judicial pronouncements, what I understand is that the

available evidence should be reliable and the said evidence and the circumstances

so proved must form a chain of events from which the only irresistible and

inescapable inference that the Court can arrive at is about the guilt of the accused

that can be said to be drawn and no other hypothesis against the guilt is possible.

The Court must satisfy itself that various circumstances in the chain of events

must be such as to rule out reasonable likelihood of the innocence of the Accused.

We are also mindful that there is always a duty cast on the Prosecution to prove

the case beyond reasonable doubt. That means, in the words of Lord Denning in

Miller vs. Minister of Pensions, 1947 All England Law Reports, p. 372, Proof

beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond the shadow of doubt. The

Law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to

deflect the course of justice.

By doing so, the Court will be mindful not to allow the suspicious circumstances

which may allow the Prosecution to strengthen their case.

The entire case is based on the blood samples taken by PW12, tallying with the

blood samples taken from the 1st Accuseds three-wheeler. The question before us

Page 8 of 9

is what the evidential value of that blood sample, which was taken from the place

where the deceased was lying in fact, belongs to the deceased.

The said SOCO officer has clearly stated that he had not taken any blood samples

from the deceaseds body. He has taken from the place where the deceaseds body

was lying.

At page 247 of the translated brief;

Q: However, you had not obtained the specimen of the blood that was

bleeding from the head.

A: Yes. No blood had been taken from the body of the deceased person. The

specimens were taken from the place where the body was found lying.

There is a serious doubt created about the exclusiveness of the said blood sample.

Further, the prosecution has failed to prove the cause of the death. The Judicial

Medical Officer, when he gave evidence has stated that the injuries would have

been caused due to an accident.

At page 112 of the translated brief;

Q: Can you explain the conclusion that you arrived at, to this Court as to

how the internal injury that was categorized by you found on the left head

could occur under what type of an attack?

A: When the deceased person had been subjected to a very strong attack

and or that deceased person, if he had fallen down and when a force becomes

heavy through that fall, such a death could take place.

Page 9 of 9

From this evidence, the Prosecution has failed to establish that the death was due

to the internal injuries which would have been caused by the Accused.

When we consider the above evidence, we are of the view that the Prosecution has

failed to establish the guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt.

Therefore, we allow the appeal.

Appeal allowed.
