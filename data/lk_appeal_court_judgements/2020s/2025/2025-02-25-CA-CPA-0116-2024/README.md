ORDER

1. Mr. Tenny Fernando for the accused-appellant-petitioner supported this

revision application for notice on the respondents. The petitioner, by this

application, is seeking to revise and set aside the judgement dated

14.12.2017 of the learned Provincial High Court Judge of the Western

Province holden at Colombo. The learned High Court Judge by the said

impugned order marked X-8, has refused and rejected an appeal preferred

by the accused-appellant-petitioner (hereinafter also referred to as the

petitioner) by which the petitioner sought to set aside the judgment dated

27.08.2010 of the learned Magistrate.

2. The sequence of events that culminated in this application needs to be set

out to comprehend the nature of this application. The petitioner along with

another were charged in the Magistrates Court of Colombo, Case No.

15419/03/2007, with a count of cheating as well as that of

misappropriation of a sum of Rs. 800,000/-. As the petitioner absconded

the learned Magistrate had proceeded in absentia as provided for by

Section 192(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Upon a trial the 1st

Accused and this petitioner (in absentia) were convicted and then

sentenced on 27.08.2010. Thereafter, an open warrant had been issued on

the petitioner.

3. The petitioner upon the lapse of almost 6 years had preferred an appeal

dated 07.09.2016 to the Provincial High Court of the Western Province

holden at Colombo. As per the caption, the said appeal appears to have

been preferred under and by virtue of the provisions of Section 2 of the

ICCPR Act No. 56 of 2007 read with chapter XXVIII of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act. [section 2 therein appears to be erroneous and should read

as Section 4(2)].

CPA-0116-24

4. The Provincial High Court Judge by the impugned Judgement dated

14.12.2017 rejected the appeal on the basis that it is out of time as the

provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act pertaining to appeals are

applicable. It was also held that when a final determination is made in

absentia proceeding under Section 192(1), Section 192(2) makes specific

provision to have the said determination vacated. Accordingly, the learned

Provincial High Court Judge held that the appellant cannot have and

maintain the said appeal and dismissed the same. This application for

revision is now preferred against the said Judgment dated14.12.2017

marked X-08.

5. According to the Mr. Tenny Fernando, the learned Judge of the Provincial

High Court was not entitled to dismiss this application as the same had

been preferred under Section 02 (it should be Section 4(2)) of the

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act. His

argument seems to be that there is no time limit or an appealable period

prescribed under the ICCPR Act. However, he concedes that the petitioner

has preferred the appeal after the lapse of almost six years.

6. It was also submitted that the 1st accused had been afforded with the

opportunity of paying half of the sum alleged to have been misappropriated

to the virtual complainant and the operation of his one-year sentence was

suspended for five years. Mr. Fernando submitted that he is seeking that

this Court be pleased to order that the same benefit and concession be

afforded to the petitioner.

7. The State Counsel Mr. Oswald Perera present in Court having had some

intimation or notice of this application appeared on behalf of the Attorney

General and submitted that they are objecting to the issuance of notice, as

the petitioner is guilty of laches in the extreme and no plausible explanation

is forthcoming either. He also submitted that the petitioner had continued

CPA-0116-24

Page 5 of 9

to abscond and he has not come to this Court with clean hands. The State

Counsel is thus resisting the issuance of notice.

8. Revisionary jurisdiction is a discretionary remedy as opposed to the

Appellate Jurisdiction. To have notice issued in a revision application the

petitioner should satisfy Court of exceptional circumstances. As to what

circumstances are exceptional depended on the facts of each case. In

Dharmaratne and Another v Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd. and Others

(2003) 3 SLR 24 at 30, it was held;

The practice of Court to insist on the existence of exceptional

circumstances for the exercise of revisionary powers has taken

deep root in our law and has got hardened into a rule which should

not be lightly disturbed. The words used by the legislature do not

indicate that it ever intended to interfere with this rule of practice.

Then, in Wijesinghe vs. Tharmaratnam Sri Skanthas Law Reports Vol.

IV 47 at 49, it was opined that;

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available

unless the application discloses circumstances which shocks the

conscience of the court.

9. The term exceptional circumstances is not defined, but courts have

time and again interpreted the term exceptional circumstances. In

Attorney General vs. Podisingho 51 NLR 385 at 390 it was held;

In my view such exceptional circumstances would be (a) where

there has been a miscarriage of justice, (b) where a strong case for

the interference of this Court has been made out by the petitioner,

or (c) where the applicant was unaware of the orders made by the

Court of trial.

10. Then, it may also be said that if the impugned order is patently illegal, the

courts have the power to treat the said patent illegality as an exceptional

circumstance and interfere with the judgment of a lower court by

CPA-0116-24

Page 6 of 9

exercising the revisionary jurisdiction. Hence, it is necessary for the

petitioner to establish exceptional circumstances by pleading such

grounds in their Revision Application, in order to invoke the discretion of

court to entertain a Revision Application.

11. In the present application, the petitioner submitted that he did pursued a

wrong remedy. It is now settled law that pursuing a wrong remedy is not a

valid excuse for laches in an application for revision. In Tirimanne vs. the

Commissioner of Income Tax 59 NLR 304, Weerasooriya J opined as

follows:

I do not see how any party who deliberately elects to adopt a

remedy which repeatedly has been held not to be the correct one

can, when the question of delay arises as a relevant consideration,

ask to be excused for not having in the first instance availed

himself of the proper remedy.

12. The impugned Judgment marked X is a Judgment made upon considering

an appeal preferred against a conviction and sentence made by the

Magistrate of the Magistrates Court of Colombo. This appeal has been

rejected on the basis that it is out of time. The impugned order had been

made on 27.10.2010. The appeal to the Provincial High Court has been

preferred on 03.01.2016. Therefore, the appeal had been made after six

years. The argument advanced before the Provincial High Court is that this

appeal has been preferred under Section 2 (should be Section 4(2)) of ICCPR

Act No. 56 of 2017 and it appears that the appellant in that Court has taken

up the position that no time frame is fixed by the ICCPR Act No. 56 of 2017

and that he is thus entitled to file an appeal at any point of time. The

Provincial High Court Judge has held that Act No. 56 of 2017 is subject to

the Provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Accordingly, the time

limits as specified in the general law is applicable to all appeals. This

pronouncement of law to my mind is clearly sound and correct. The appeal

is thus out of time by many years. There is no provision to entertain or

CPA-0116-24

Page 7 of 9

accept a criminal appeal notwithstanding the lapse of time and any appeal

filed out of time cannot be accepted and considered as such Court would

not have jurisdiction. His Lordship Justice Surasena in Ekanayake

Mudiyanselage Upali Herath vs. Aluthge Wijedasa [CA

(PHC)/163/2002] stated as follows:

When the law has provided for a right of appeal along with a time

period within which that right is required to be exercised, that

clearly means that such right of appeal is subject to a condition.

The said condition is that any party desirous of exercising such

right of appeal is required to exercise it within the given time period.

This means that no such right of appeal exists after the lapse of

the specified period. When such right of appeal does not exist due

to the lapse of the provided appealable period, a party is not

permitted to lodge an appeal in Court. Therefore, the Court to which

a party wrongfully attempts to tender any such appeal, after the

appealable period granted by law has lapsed, is duty bound to

reject it without accepting.

13. The learned High Court judge has rejected the appeal as the same was out

of time. In view of the aforesaid dicta, adhering to the said appealable period

is a necessary prerequisite to have and persue the appeal. With the lapse

of the appealable period so prescribed, there will exist no right of appeal,

and as such, the appellate court will have no option or discretion but to

reject the said purported appeal. This is exactly what the learned High

Court judge had ordered by the impugned judgement. Therefore, there is

no basis in law or otherwise, to disturb or review the said decision.

14. It is also relevant to note that there had not been any application made to

the Provincial High Court to act in revision either. In these circumstances,

this Court cannot act in revision against the Judgment dated 27.08.2010

of the Magistrate of the Magistrates Court of Colombo.

CPA-0116-24

Page 8 of 9

15. As to the delay on the face of the pleadings, the impugned order had been

made on 14.12.2017. The appeal had been preferred on 03.09.2024 which

is almost six years and ten months after the impugned order. I see no

acceptable reason or explanation for such delay.

16. Now to consider the effect and import of Section 4 (2) of the ICCPR Act No.

56 of 2007. Section 4(2) reads thus:

Every person convicted of a criminal offence under any written

law, shall have the right to appeal to a higher court against such

conviction and any sentence imposed.

17. Even if Section 4(2) of ICCPR Act has conferred a right of appeal, unless it

specifically and expressly provides for a different appealable period, the

general law Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act will apply

and determine the appealable time.

18. The right of appeal of a person convicted and sentenced by a Magistrate as

provided for by Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act is as

follows:

320. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 317, 318 and 319 any

person who shall be dissatisfied with any judgment or final order

pronounced by any Magistrate's Court in a criminal case or matter to

which he is a party may prefer an appeal to the Court of Appeal against

such judgment for any error in law, or in fact

(a) by lodging within fourteen days from the time of such judgment or

order being passed or made, with such Magistrate's Court a petition

of appeal addressed to the Court of Appeal, or

(b)

CPA-0116-24

Page 9 of 9

19. Correspondingly, the right of appeal to the High Court of the Province is

conferred by Section 4 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990. As for the procedure applicable, would be

the existing provisions applicable to the appeals to the Court of Appeal from

the Magistrates Courts [vide Section 5 of the High Court of the Provinces

(Special Provisions) Act].

20. In the above circumstances, when an appeal is out of time, the Appellate

Court will not have any discretion to accept such an appeal

notwithstanding such lapse of time, and will not have jurisdiction to

entertain such an appeal. It is just that such court lacks jurisdiction to

entertain or consider such an appeal. Accordingly, there is no lawful basis

to interfere with the impugned judgement marked X-8.

21. In these circumstances, there is no legal basis to issue notice as prayed for,

and this application for the issuance of notice is refused and the petition is

accordingly dismissed in limine.
