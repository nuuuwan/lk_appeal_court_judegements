JUDGEMENT

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J.

1. The petitioner is seeking a writ of certiorari to quash the tender awarded

to the 9th respondent for the supply of raw food items for the period of

2024-2025 to the District General Hospital of Trincomalee. This is the

substantive relief, whilst consequential writs of mandamus and

prohibition are also sought, to prevent the 1st to 8th respondents from

awarding the said tender to any other person. This matter was taken

up for argument on 06.08.2025 and this judgement is accordingly

pronounced.

2. The 9th respondent was continuously absent and unrepresented

notwithstanding notices being sent. However, when this matter was

mentioned on 08.07.2025, the 9th respondent was present on notice

and was represented by Mr. K. Jackson, Attorney-at-Law. Accordingly,

time was granted for the 9th respondent to file his objections. 1st to 8th

respondents were represented by the learned Senior State Counsel, who

informed that the limited statement of objections has already been filed

at the stage of supporting, and that the same be considered as the

objections of the substantive matter as well. However, permission was

sought to submit further documents along with an affidavit on behalf

of the said respondents. The Senior State Counsel was permitted to do

so. Accordingly, by motion dated 16.07.2025, an affidavit of the 2nd

respondent R-9 was tendered, with Annextures 1 - 20. The matter was

then taken up for argument on 06.08.2025, on which day the 9th

respondent was once again absent and unrepresented, and the said

respondent had failed and not filed any objections either.

3. The petitioner is engaged in the business under the business names

registration of ABC Enterprises. The petitioner, under the name and

style of ABC Enterprises, has submitted a bid in response to a tender

for the supply of raw food to the District General Hospital of

Trincomalee for the period 2024-2025. He had been a responsive and

WRT/0058/25

Page 5 of 10

qualifying bidder; however, as the 9th respondents bid amount was less

than that of the petitioner, the said tender had been awarded to the 9th

respondent.

4. Upon the selection of the 9th respondent, the petitioner has lodged an

objection and preferred an appeal to the Tender Appeals Committee of

the Ministry of Health. The basis of the said objection and appeal is that

the purported business name registration certificate P-6 submitted with

the tender document is false or fraudulent. According to the bid

documents and the advertisement, submitting a valid business

registration certificate was required in accordance with Clause 2 (g) (III)

of the tender conditions contained in bid document P-4. As submitted

by Mr. Weragoda, this was a requirement to prove the experience of

such bidder in such business (the supply of fresh food). The said

Appeals Committee, upon considering the same, had rejected the

appeal, and the tender had been awarded to the 9th respondent.

5. The petitioner, in this application, is seeking a writ to quash the award

of the said tender, on the same basis of the absence of a valid business

names registration certificate. Thus, the issue for determination by this

Court is substantially based on a question of fact; namely, the validity

of the said certificate P-6. The learned Senior State Counsel, on behalf

of the respondents did submit that the facts are in dispute, and the

petitioner cannot have and maintain this application. It is settled law

that if facts are in dispute, that a writ will not issue. In Thajudeen vs.

Sri Lanka Tea Board and Another (1981) 2 SLR 471, Ranasinghe, J.,

(as His Lordship was then) held as follows:

Where the major facts are in dispute and the legal result of the facts is subject to controversy and it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in a suit where parties would have ample opportunity of examining the witnesses so that the Court would be better able to judge which version is correct, a Writ will not issue.

WRT/0058/25

However, upon a perusal of the petition, objection, and documentation,

it appears that the relevant fact as to the dates, events, and fact of the

issue of the certificate are available in the record, and it is no more than

a matter of considering the said facts in the correct perspective and

facts are in dispute in that sense. Accordingly, I will now proceed to

consider the arguments advanced.

6. According to the petitioner, the said business names registration of the

9th respondent under the name and style of Riskhan Stores, bearing

registration no. DKB/00/12 (marked P-6), is a false or a forged

document. The basis of this assertion is that the business names

registration was originally issued on 14.05.2000. The Assistant

Divisional Secretary, Mr. Krishnendran, whose signature appears on P-

6 was not in service at the time. Accordingly, it was submitted that P-6

is a forgery or a false document and this defect disqualifies and

disentitles the 9th respondent to have been awarded with the said

tender. In support of this position, the petitioner submitted the letter P-

7 from the person who is said to have signed the said business

registration certificate P-6, namely Mr. Chandran Krishnendran,

Assistant Divisional Secretary of Kinniya. According to letter P-7, the

said Mr. Krishnendran had joined the Sri Lanka Administrative Service

in October 2006. The submission was that, he could not have signed

the said certificate (P-6) in the year 2000. It was also submitted that the

date of issue of P-6 is 14.05.2000, which happens to be a Sunday.

Therefore, there is an inherent improbability, as this document could

not have been signed by Mr. Krishnendran before he assumed duties in

the year 2006. On these grounds, the said certificate was impugned and

an appeal had been preferred to the Appeals Committee of the Ministry

of Health. However, the said appeal, upon being considered by the

Procurements Appeals Committee C of the Ministry of Health has

decided that the material submitted by the appellant ABC Enterprises

is not sufficient and the appeal had been rejected. Then, it was decided

to award the tender to Riskhan Stores, subject to it being amended if

WRT/0058/25

Page 7 of 10

the said certificate was found to be a false document at any time

thereafter. Accordingly, this tender had been so awarded to the 9th

respondent. The said Report of the Committee is marked R-7 by the

respondents.

7. The position taken up by the 1st - 8th respondents is that the certificate

of business registration (P-6) was submitted along with the tender. P-6

is a duplicate copy issued later. The respondents annexed an affidavit

(R-5) from the person who has checked the certified copy P-6 at the

point of issuing the same. The said affidavit of the said officer,

Mohammed Ismail Ansar, deposes to the fact that he is the officer who

checked the same and states that the original certificate, bearing No.

DKB/00/12, was issued in the year 2000, and the duplicate copy of the

said certificate was issued in or after 2007, signed by the then Assistant

Divisional Secretary Mr. Krishnendran at Kinniya. This fact is further

confirmed by the affidavit marked R-6 of the 9th respondent where it is

deposed that the copy was obtained in 2007/2008. Mr. Ansar further

deposes to the fact that his signature appears as the person who had

checked the same. Further, according to document P-14, subsequent

inquiries made under the Right to Information Act have confirmed that

the relevant records, which happened to be older than 10 years, were

not available at the Divisional Secretariat. In P-7, Mr. Krishnendran

does not deny the signature on P-6 either.

8. The business names registration certificate that has been submitted

along with the tender by the 9th respondent (P-6), is a copy issued in

the year 2007, the original of which has been registered on 14.05.2000.

The petitioners position is that Mr. Krishnendran was not in service

prior to 2006. As such, this certificate could not have been issued by

him. In support of this, the letter P-7 issued by Mr. Krishnendran was

tendered by the petitioner. According to P-7, Mr. C. Krishnendran has

joined the Sri Lanka Administrative Service in October 2006, and has

assumed the duties of Assistant Divisional Secretary in January 2007,

WRT/0058/25

Page 8 of 10

and was serving at the Divisional Secretariat of Kinniya. The argument

of impossibility advanced by Mr. Weragoda is on the premise that Mr.

Krishnendran could not have signed a certificate in May 2000. This is

misconceived. Though registered in 14.05.2000, the copy P-6 has been

issued subsequently in 2007, at which point of time Mr. Krishnendran

had been holding office and he could have thus signed the copy P-6.

Hence there is no impossibility. The petitioner has not submitted any

letter or document from Mr. Krishnendran denying his signature either.

Accordingly, the argument advanced and the position taken up by the

petitioner is misconceived and erroneous to that extent. The issue was

also raised that the original certificate of P-6 had been registered on

14.05.2000, which happens to be a Sunday. What is relevant and

important to this application is not the date of first registration but the

validity of the copy of the business names registration (P-6) as certified

and issued in 2007. To that extent, the acceptance of P-6 and the

rejection of this appeal by R-7 and awarding of the tender to the 9th

respondent cannot be found fault with.

9. Mr. Weragoda, during the course of the arguments emphasized the fact

that a valid business names registration certificate was necessary for

the purpose of satisfying that such tenderer has sufficient experience,

in this instance, in the supply of fresh vegetables and fruits. According

to the Appeals Committee Report (R-7) under the sub-topic of

Observations under item no. 6 it is observed that the 9th respondent

had been supplying fresh food to other hospitals within the Ministry

during the period 2022-23, and the 9th respondent has sufficient

experience in this field. Accordingly, in awarding the tender to the 9th

respondent, the 1st 8th respondents have considered the alleged flaw

of the certificate per se and had been mindful and adverted to the aspect

of experience of the 9th respondent in this field. In the above premises,

there is no irregularity or irrationality, all relevant facts have been

considered, the lawful procedure has been followed and the petitioner

has been duly heard. This is basically errors of fact. In the exercise of

WRT/0058/25

Page 9 of 10

the writ jurisdiction, courts will readily review errors of law. However,

courts will be slow and reluctant to review errors of fact. The rationale

is that when a decision make is provided with a discretion to determine

matters of fact such authority would decide the same based on the

factual information in his hands. Therefore, in the exercise of the power

of review courts exercise caution in stepping on to shoes of the relevant

decision maker. That being so, errors of fact which are of a fundamental

nature that would render a decision unlawful would be reviewed. In this

regard, I find that the following view expressed by Hilaire Barnett in

Constitution and Administrative Law - 9th Edition at page 581 is

relevant;

Errors of fact raise difficult questions. As has been seen, an error of law will be made when the decision maker acts contrary to the requirements of legality - or, in other words, he has broken one of the rules for lawful decision-making Errors of fact are more complex. If a decision maker bases his decision on a misunderstanding of the factual situation of the case, he will reach a decision which is wrong. The question which then arises is whether the courts will review such an error in judicial review proceedings. In general, the answer to that question is that the courts will be very cautious. After all, the courts will often not have the expertise to assess the factual situation, and may have great difficulty in deciding whether a factual error has resulted in the wrong decision. The courts have traditionally approached this matter by dividing errors of fact into two categories. The first relates to reviewable errors of facts which are jurisdictional, and the other category is that of non-reviewable, non-jurisdictional facts.

10. Notwithstanding the aforesaid legal position, I have considered the said

issue of fact to determine the correctness and the reasonableness of the

decision to accept the certificate of business names registration marked

P-6. For the reasons adverted to above, I find the said decision is

reasonable and correct. In the above circumstances, I am of the view

that the petitioner has failed to make out any lawful ground on which

the writs as prayed for could be issued.

WRT/0058/25

Page 10 of 10

11. Accordingly, I see no basis in law or otherwise, to grant the relief prayed

for by the petitioner by prayer (c), for a writ of certiorari to quash the

award of the tender to the 9th respondent and other consequential relief

sought.

12. Accordingly, this application is dismissed. However, I make no order as

to costs.
