(c) Grant and Issue a Writ in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st

consideration of the several discrepancies and anomalies in the examination paper

and results given therein.

(d) In the alternative to prayer (c) Grant and Issue a Writ in the nature of a Writ of

Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent and/or its nominees and/or agents to pass all

candidates that sat for the examination for the position of Assistant Manager (III-3) in

December 2019 who have obtained a combined average of forty percent (40%) from

both examinations, in consideration of the several discrepancies and anomalies in the

examination paper and results given therein.

(e) In the alternative to prayers (c) and (d) Grant and Issue a Writ in the nature of a Writ

Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent and/or its nominees and/or agents to pass

candidates that sat for the examination for the position of Assistant Manager (III-3) in

December 2019 who have a the pass mark of forty percent (40%) in both examinations,

in consideration of the several discrepancies and anomalies in the examination paper

results given therein and the fact that forty (40%) has been the standard pass mark.

(f) Call for the Examination Papers of the examination held of the post of Assistant

Manager (III-3) in December 2019 and the admission cards for such exams.

1. As per journal entries dated 25-05-2023, the Learned State Counsel appearing for the 5th,

6th and 8th Respondents and the Learned Counsel for the 7th Respondent has informed the

Court that the Staff Circular bearing No. 8570/2020 marked P13 mentioned in the relief

(b) has been revoked. Although the Petitioners have accepted this position, they had

resolved to continue with other reliefs. Therefore, this judgement will deal only with the

substantive reliefs sought in prayer (c), (d), (e) and (f).

2. 1st Petitioner to this Application is an established trade union of the 1st Respondent Bank.

2nd to 21st Petitioners are employees of the 1st Respondent Bank and members of the 1st

Petitioner, Union who had sat for the impugned examination held on 15-12-2015 for

promotion to Assistant Manager (III-3), under a promotion scheme and a Syllabus

established by internal staff circulars.

3. Initially, the staff circulars giving the promotion scheme applicable for promotion to the

position of Assistant Manager (III-3) had been the Staff Circular No. 444/2018 dated 16-

02-2018 (annexed marked as P5) along with Staff Circular No. 444/2018(I) dated 21-11-

2019 (annexed marked as P6) which had superseded previous Staff Circulars No. 300/99

and 337/2002 (respectively annexed as P2 and P3).

4. The promotion scheme applicable for position of Assistant Manager (III-3) in Staff Circular

P5 was amended by Staff Circular No. 8372/2019 dated 10-06-2019 (annexed to the

marked as P7) which was issued as a unique and a not to be repeated offer to the staff,

giving them an a once-and -for-all opportunity irrespective of the cadre restrictions which

was in previous circular. However, P7 circular also required a candidate to score a

minimum of 50% for each of the two question papers (which constituted the written

examination) in one and the same sitting, to pass the examination.

5. Staff Circular No 8372/2019 (1) dated 25-07-2019 (annexed marked as P8) has been issued

as an extension to P7. However, the Staff Circular No. 316/2000 dated 05-12-2000 giving

the syllabus for the promotion examination (respectively annexed marked as P4) had

continued to remain unchanged.

6. The impugned examination for promotion to Assistant Manager (III-3), had been held on

15-12-2015 with approximately 1,599 candidates sitting and out of which, 773 had passed

(according to the Petitioners). The results had been published on 04-08-2020 (paragraph

27 of the Petition). The 1st Respondent Bank had proceeded to give appointments to the

candidates who had passed the examination.

7. It is the contention of the Petitioners that more than 50% of the candidates could not pass

the examination as owing to, inter alia, irregularities and/or mistakes and/or translation

7

discrepancies between the Sinhala, Tamil and English papers. It is further submitted that

questions were not in conformity with the syllabus (stipulated in Staff Circular marked as

P4) and there were issues regarding the conduct of the examination which has prompted

the Petitioners to seek the reliefs prayed in (c) to (f).

8. According to the Petitioners, the issues in the above paragraph had been brought to the

notice of the management by the 7th Respondent Union by their letter dated 24-12-2019

(annexed marked as P9) and thereafter, by 1st Petitioners letter dated 07-10-2020

(annexed marked as P14) but no action has been taken.

9. Subsequently 1st Respondent Bank issued a staff circular bearing No 8570/2020 (annexed

to the Petition marked P13), inter alia, calling for applications for Assistant Manager (III-

3), where the threshold figure to pass the written examination has reverted back to 40%

and it is the contention of the 1st Petitioner that this would be unfair by those candidates

who sat for the examination on the 15-08-2020.

10. Although it appears that it was the P13 Staff Circular that prompted the filing of this

Application, during the pendency of this Application the 1st Petitioner withdrew P13.

Hence, the Petitioners concern regarding this circular or regarding an examination being

held under circular P13 is no longer valid.

11. However, it is to be noted that the Petitioners are not challenging the P7 and P8 circulars,

or asking for their cancellation, Petitioners are only challenging the formulation of the

question papers and the manner in which the 15-12-2019 examination was conducted.

In prayer (c), the Petitioners request that in consideration of the discrepancies and

anomalies in the impugned examination paper, all those candidates who sat for the

15-12-2019 examination be declared as having passed.

Or as an alternative to prayer to (c), in prayer (d) Petitioners request that in

consideration of the discrepancies and anomalies in the impugned examination paper,

all those candidates who has received a combined average of 40% for both papers

should be passed.

Or as an alternative prayer to (c) and (d), in prayer (e), Petitioners request that in

consideration of the discrepancies and anomalies in the impugned examination paper,

8

all those candidates who has received a threshold figure of 40% for both papers

individually should be passed based upon the fact that was the established threshold

figure prior to issuing of P7.

12. As all three prayers are based on the alleged discrepancies and anomalies in the impugned

examination paper, firstly it should be examined whether in fact there was discrepancies,

anomalies and other defects mentioned by the Petitioners.

13. The impugned examination has been conducted by the 5th Respondent, Department of

Examination under a contract (marked as 5R1) signed between the 1st Respondent Bank

and the 5th Respondent. The 5th, 6th, and 8th Respondents have denied the allegations of

discrepancies, anomalies and other defects in their limited objections and have further

stated that the examination paper and the corresponding marking scheme has been

formulated by a competent examination panel based on P4, P7, and P8.

Disputed or Doubtful facts

14. The Petitioners in their written submission answering the allegation that all necessary

parties had not been named had stated that all employees of the 1st Respondent Bank

belongs to either the 1st Petitioner Union or the 7th Respondent Union and as both Unions

are parties to this Application, all necessary parties are named.

15. Even if the 7th Respondents claimed that majority of the bank staff belongs to their Inion

is disregarded, from the Petitioners admission itself it is evident that 1st Petitioner Union

does not represent the entire workforce of the 1st Respondent Bank, nor does it represent

the entirety of the candidates who sat for the 15-12-2019 examination.

16. It is apparent that 1st Petitioner Union represents only the candidates who are members

of the 1st Petitioner Union. The 7th Respondent Union, on behalf of their members, has

denied the claims made by the 1st Petitioner Union in paragraph 23 (ii) of the Petition,

which states that irregularities and/or mistakes and/or translation discrepancies led to

50% of the candidates being unsuccessful. Further, the 7th Respondent Union wants the

Petition to be dismissed in limine.

9

17. While the Petitioners have tried to counter the 7th Respondent's position by referencing

their letter P9, which acknowledges certain errors and defects and requests relief from the

Deputy General Manager of Human Resources, this letter does not prevent the 7th

Respondent from later reaching a contrary conclusion regarding the errors and defects

they initially highlighted.

18. The Petitioners, have not specifically submitted what constitute the irregularities,

mistakes, translation discrepancies and the questions that were not in line with the P4

Syllabus. It appears that for this purpose the Petitioners had relied on P9 however, this

letter is not supported by its author.

19. The 5th Respondent, who prepared the question paper, has denied the allegations made

in paragraph 23, 24, 25 and 26 of the Petitions concerning irregularities and/or mistakes

and/or translation discrepancies, and questions not being in line with the P4 Syllabus.

Similarly, the 1st to 4th Respondents has also denied the same. Even if P9 had been

accepted by the 7th Respondent, this Court is unable to determine the truth of the claims

given the rejections by the 1st to 5th Respondents.

20. Even if, in response to prayer (f), the papers from the impugned examination were made

available to the Court, it would still be impossible for the Court to determine whether

there were errors, defects, or nonconformities with the syllabus without conducting an

inquiry. The Court cannot issue an order compelling a public institution to perform an act

based on disputed or uncertain facts.

Reliefs prayed for is untenable

21. The relief sought in prayer (c) is to pass all candidates that sat for the examination on

consideration of the several discrepancies and anomalies in the examination paper and

results given therein. The justification for this request appears to be on the premise that

all the candidates that were unsuccessful was solely unsuccessful because of the above

stated discrepancies and anomalies. However, if the 1st Respondent is to accede to this

request, it needs ensure that no candidate was unsuccessful because of their

incompetency, as it would be contrary to the basis submitted by the Petitioners.

10

Considering there is no conceivable manner to ascertain this prayer (c), can considered to

be misconceived to the point of absurdity.

22. When considering the alternate prayers (d) and (e), the 1st Respondents request to pass

all those who had received in excess of 40% (respectively under two different method of

calculating) based on the threshold figure which prevailed before the issuing of P7 circular.

This is also baseless, as 1st Petitioner has accepted the P7 and its new threshold figure of

50% without objections, and as such now there is no rational basis for reverting back to

40%.

Laches

23. P7 circular had been issued in 10-06-2019 and the examination based on the said circular

was held on 15-12-2019. There is no indication that the 1st Petitioner Union prior to the

holding of the examination ever objected to P7 or any part of P7. As the 1st Petitioner

Union has not specifically challenged P7 and P8, it is not material. However, even after

the impugned examinations was held, there is no indication that the 1st Petitioner took

any action to challenge the impugned examination till 07-10-2020 on which day a protest

letter (annexed to the petition as P14) had been sent to the Chief Executive Officer and to

the General Manager of the 1st Respondent Bank.

24. On the day of the examination or shortly thereafter, the 1st Petitioner Union should have

been aware of the issues challenged by this Application. There is no satisfactory

explanation for 1st Petitioner Unions inaction from 15-12-2019 to 07-10-2020. As such the

Petitioners are guilty of laches.

Availability of a writ of Mandamus

25. The availability of a writ of mandamus to compel a state bank to promote employees

depends on whether the duty to promote is regarded as a public (statutory) duty or is

instead a matter of private discretion.

26. In Piyasiri vs. Peoples Bank (1989) 2 Sri. LR 47, the Court of Appeal held that although a

state bank was subject to certain ministerial directions, it was essentially a commercial

11

institution and the court refused to issue a writ of mandamus to compel the bank to call

an employee for an interview for promotion because:

I. The banks promotion circular (Circular No. 186/82) did not have statutory force, and

II. The banks internal process for promotion was discretionary rather than a mandatory public duty.

27. In this instant Application, the Petitioners having accepted P7 and P8, are not challenging

the promotion scheme. The 1st Respondent Bank based on P7 and P8, owes no duty to

promote the unsuccessful candidates.

28. The examination papers had been prepared and the examination conducted by the 5th

Respondent on the guidelines given by the 1st Respondent, as a result of a contract

between the 1st and the 5th Respondents. The Petitioners have failed to demonstrate that

5th Respondent for whatever reason, failed to perform a well-defined, non-discretionary

duty where no other remedy is available. Further, Petitioners have failed to demonstrate

that 1st and/or the 5th Respondent has acted arbitrarily or in bad Faith.

Based on the circumstances and reasons provided above, I am not inclined to grant any of

the reliefs prayed for in the prayer to the Petition.

Application is dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL Dhammika Ganepola, J. I agree.
