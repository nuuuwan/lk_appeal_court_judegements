Ex facia, an academic allowance is an allowance paid to cover the cost incurred for academic purposes during the occupation of the employee. It is my view that, contrary to the living allowance, an academic allowance paid to university academic staff does not contribute to subsistence or sustenance to their livelihood in any manner. The rule of interpretation, ejusdem generis rule, provides that where specific words are followed by general words, the general words should be interpreted in the context of the specific words that precede them. As such, I hold that an Academic Allowance cannot be construed as a cost of living allowance, special living allowance or other similar allowance in calculating the gratuity in terms of the Act and that there is no obligatory requirement in law to count an academic allowance in calculating gratuity in terms of the Act.",
