JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused- Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted before

the High Court of Kandy on two counts of grave sexual abuse committed on one minor

namely, As Addumme Gedara Iduranga Sanjaya punishable under Section 365B

(2)(b) of the Penal Code as amended by Acts Nos. 22 of 1995, 28 of 1998 and 16 of

2006.

The Prosecution led the evidence of 10 witnesses and marked 2 productions. The

Accused gave a dock statement in defence. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned

High Court Judge by judgment dated 18.05.2023 convicted the Accused and

Page 3 of 7

sentenced him to 7 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000/- in default

6 months simple imprisonment for the 1st count. For the 2nd count, 10 years of rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 15,000/- in default 6 months simple imprisonment,

20% for Victim Protection Fund with a 3 months imprisonment in default was

sentenced and a compensation of Rs. 250,000 was imposed to be paid to the victim

carried with 10 months of simple imprisonment in default.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentences, the Accused preferred an

appeal in this Court.

The grounds of appeal as pleaded by the Accused as follows;

1. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the inherent improbabilities

and the inconsistencies in the Prosecution version.

2. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that the defense story is more

probable and well supported by the some of the prosecution witnesses too, and

there is a reasonable doubt created in the prosecution case.

3. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that an adverse inference would

safely be drawn from the failure of the prosecution to call its material witness

PW -03 Isuru.

During the argument stage, the Counsel for the Prosecution brought to the notice of

the Court that the Victim, PW1 had taken different versions during the trial.

According to him, after the evidence led before the Learned High Court Judge, the

Prosecution has amended the indictment on the evidence led. Thereafter, the Learned

Page 4 of 7

High Court Judge who succeeded the earlier Judge summoned the main Prosecution

witness where he told a different version. It shows that PW1 was not consistent in

his testimony.

During the examination in chief on 24.01.2019, PW1 testified that he attended

Sunday School (Daham Pasal) at the temple and used to go to the temple occasionally

to clean the premises when the Accused asked them to. At the time he went to the

temple, usually, there were no one. According to PW1, the incident happened at the

Awasa geya in the temple where the monks usually stay. He went inside the Awasa

geya as the Accused asked him to buy a phone card when PW1 and one of his friends

namely Isuru went to the temple. During that time, Isuru and the Accused were

repairing a water pipe. When PW1 went inside the Awasa geya to get money to buy

the said phone card, the Accused closed the door. Then the Accused had removed

PW1s clothes and pressed his penis on his backside.

After around 5 minutes, the Accused had wiped out something and PW1 had worn

his clothes back and left saying he had to attend classes. He met his friend Isuru and

told him that he was going home. PW1 states that he did not tell about the incident

to his parents as he was scared.

According to PW1, he made a statement to the Police after 5 months from the

incident.

As stated by PW1, he had told his mother that he could not go to Sunday School

anymore as there were no other boys. However, according to him, the real reason was

the incident that happened.

During the examination in chief on 30.08.2022, the PW1 testified that he knew the

Accused from the time he used to go to the Sunday School at the temple and he was

his teacher. According to him, the incident happened at the Awasa geya in the temple.

On the day in question, PW1 went to the temple for a shramadana where the Accused

and a friend called Isuru were there. Then, all three of them had gone to repair a

broken tap and the Accused had called PW1 to the Awasa geya saying he needed to

buy a phone card. According to him, the incident happened there. The Accused had

then touched his full body and removed PW1s trousers. Then, Accused had pressed

his penis between PW1s legs.

Then he continued to do this for 5 -10 minutes and stopped it after a white substance

was released.

According to PW1, the Accused was naked at that time. Thereafter, the Accused

wiped the white substance from the victims back and asked him to wear his clothes.

According to PW1, the Accused asked PW1 not to tell anyone about the incident and

PW1 had agreed.

When we consider both the testimonies, he has stated about two different versions of

sexual acts done by the Accused.

We are mindful that our Courts have held that if the evidence of the victim is

convincing in sexual abuse cases, the Court does not need corroboration. The

conviction for the sexual offences can be based on the sole testimony of the victim if

it is reliable and there is no infirmity. That evidence inspires confidence and must be

relied upon without seeking corroboration of a statement in a material particular.

But in the instant case, the victim has stated two versions with regard to the sexual

act. The question is whether this Court can rely on his evidence. The evidence of PW1

was not convincing and not consistent.

The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the inconsistency of the victim.

We hold that the evidence of the victim is not sufficient to come to a conclusion with

regard to the guilt of the Accused. The Prosecution has failed to prove beyond

reasonable doubt the act of sexual act performed on the victim with the evidence of

PW1.

I therefore, set aside the conviction and the sentences and acquit the Accused on the

charge with which he was convicted.

Appeal allowed.
