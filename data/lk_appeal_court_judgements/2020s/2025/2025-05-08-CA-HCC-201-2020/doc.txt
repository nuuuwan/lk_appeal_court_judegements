JUDGEMENT

1. The accused-appellant (hereinafter also referred to as the

appellant) was charged and indicted for the possession of 1006

grammes of heroin on or about 14.12.1998 at Pettah punishable

under Section 54A (d) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance. Upon a trial before Judge the appellant was

convicted and sentenced to death on 24.09.2020. The appellant

has preferred this appeal against the said Judgement and

sentence.

2. The facts of this incident may be summarized as follows. On

14.12.1998, a group of Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) officers led

by IP Amarajith acting on information received by IP Amarajith

had conducted a raid and apprehended the appellant allegedly

with approximately 2 kilogrammes of heroin (gross amount). As

IP Amarajith was not available to give evidence, the prosecution

led the evidence of PW-2, PC 25141 Gunaratne and PW-5, SI

Sumanadasa on the main raid and of the chain production (initial

stage). The prosecution version as narrated by the said witnesses

is that they led by IP Amarajith and proceeded to Main Street,

HCC-0201-20

Page 3 of 9

Pettah and upon meeting the informant they proceeded to

Kochchikade Fish Market. From Main Street Pettah, the raiding

party in civvies proceeded on foot to the Kochchikade Fish

Market. After about 20 minutes wait, the informant upon

pointing out the appellant and left. The appellant was walking

with a large shopping bag which IP Amarajith had searched and

found approximately 2 kilo grammes of powder which was

initially identified as being heroin. This was around 10 am.

Thereafter, the Police party had proceeded to Wattala and

searched a house of a relation of the appellant. However, nothing

was found at that house. Then, they have returned to Main Street

and parked their vehicle close to Titus Stores and were waiting

for a person named Sadees. Having waited until 12:10 pm as the

said person did not arrive, the house of the appellant at

Vivekananda Road had been searched and then the police party

had returned to the PNB around 1.15pm, where the productions

were weighed and sealed by IP Amarajith.

3. As opposed to this accused himself had given evidence and called

two witnesses. The sum total of the defence evidence is that the

appellant was arrested near the fish stall but denies the recovery

of any narcotic from his possession. Upon questioning the

appellant admits going to that house of one Francis Vass in

Wattala and states that the police party when they returned from

that house had in their possession a pink colour bag. Then, they

have returned to Pettah upon searching his house they have

returned to the PNB. These are the competing version of the

prosecution and defence.

4. The main ground of appeal of the appellant is the failure to prove

the chain of production as to the inward journey. It was

submitted that IP Amarajith upon recovering the production had

it in his custody until it was brought to the PNB and sealed. In

HCC-0201-20

Page 4 of 9

the absence of IP Amarajith, the evidence of the chain of custody

as well as the main raid was led through PW-2 and PW-5. The

absence of main raiding officer will not per se invalidate or will

not make the proof of such raid inadmissible. In the normal

course of events, the scheme of the Evidence Ordinance will

require the best evidence to be led. It will be the evidence of IP

Amarajith. When this matter was taken up for trial, IP Amarajith

was not available. In these circumstances, if there be other

witnesses who are privy and has witnessed such witness are

competent to give evidence and such evidence if admitted will be

sufficient to prove even a raid of this nature. Such evidence is

direct testimony of persons who have seen and perceived by their

own senses the raid and recovery. PW-2 and PW-5 have been

members of the raiding party. They have been present with IP

Amarajith from the very inception until the return and sealing of

the production. Therefore, these two witnesses are eye witnesses

to the events and happenings, the raid and recovery of this case.

Such direct evidence is sufficient to prove the fact in issue of this

case, the possession of heroin by the appellant.

5. However, the challenge as to the inward journey of the chain of

production is based on a fifteen-minute duration when both

PW-2 and PW-5 were not with IP Amarajith. The appellants main

argument is that the inward journey contains a lacuna in respect

of this 15-minute period. The learned Trial Judge at page 771 has

observed as follows.

. .

. . 2 5,

.

HCC-0201-20

6. Accordingly, the Trial Judge has been of the view that when small

quantities of narcotics are recovered during a raid such officer

usually keeps the recovered item in his trouser or shirt pocket.

In such circumstances, the other witnesses may not see the

production physically. The Trial Judge has been of the view that

similarly PW-2 and PW-5 whilst near Titus Stores may not have

seen the production. This, the Trial Judge holds would not

amount to breach of the chain evidence of the inward journey.

7. The importance of proving the inward journey of the chain of

productions was considered in Witharana Doli Nona vs.

Republic of Sri Lanka (CA 19/19), Sisira De Abrew J., observed

that:

It is a recognized principle that in drug-related cases the

prosecution must prove the chain relating to the inward

journey. The purpose of this principle is to establish that the

productions have not been tampered with. The prosecution

must prove that the productions taken from the accused-

appellant were examined by the government analyst. To

prove this, the prosecution must prove all the links of the

chain from the time it was taken from the accused-appellant

to the Government Analyst's department.

Then J.A.N de Silva J., (as he then was) in Perera vs. AG [(1998)

1 SLR 378] opined that;

It is a recognized principle that in a case of this nature, the

prosecution must prove that the productions had been

forwarded to the Analyst from proper custody, without

allowing room for any suspicion that there had been no

opportunity for tampering or interfering with the production

till they reach the Analyst. Therefore, it is correct to state that

the most important journey is the inward journey because

HCC-0201-20

Page 6 of 9

the final analyst report will depend on that. The outward

journey does not attract the same importance.

8. As stated above an eye witness may be able to establish the chain

of production. This is in effect proof by direct evidence. As proving

of any fact, it is also possible to be prove the chain of production

inferentially by circumstantial evidence. I am of the view that

even the chain of productions may be proved by circumstantial

evidence. One such instance may be when there are several

reserve officers who have had custody of the production and if

one such officer is not available the chain may be proved by the

evidence of other witnesses who had possession prior to and

after, such officer, provided that both of previous and subsequent

officers clearly testify that the seals were intact. Then, may be if

the sealing officer confirms that the seals placed by him were duly

there in that form, at a point of time anterior to the time such

non available officer handled the production. This is possible if

on the proved circumstances the only inference is that the seals

were intact, and there is no possible opportunity to tamper. The

whole requirement and necessity to prove the chain is to satisfy

court that the very production that was recovered from the

appellant was forwarded to the Government Analyst in that form

and that there was no room for tampering. That being the legal

position, reverting back to the facts of the present appeal, the

issue is the absence of direct evidence as to the inward journey

of the chain during the time IP Amarajith had possession of the

same.

9. When the team of officers arrived and parked near the Titus

Stores PW-2 and PW-5 were with IP Amarajith. PW-2 and PW-5

at a particular point of time has left the jeep and was not with IP

Amarajith. The accused in his evidence states that IP Amarajith

himself left the jeep. Therefore, there is a lack of direct evidence

HCC-0201-20

Page 7 of 9

as to the custody of the production during that time. That being

so, lets consider if there are sufficient circumstances to

inferentially establish the chain. The learned Trial Judge

proceeds on the basis that when small quantities of narcotics are

recovered such raiding officer keeps it in his shirt or trouser

pocket. Then, other witnesses may not see. As stated above, the

quantity is 2 kilo grammes of a powder. According to PW-2, the

substance was recovered in a bag which was thereon in the

custody of IP Amarajith. The witness referred to the same as a

large sized bag ( ). In the normal course of

events 2 kilo grammes of a powder or substance similar to that

which is referred to as by the witnesses would be substantial

in volume. Therefore, it would per se not be possible to have such

a parcel or a bag in a normal size pocket. Therefore, the

observation of the Trial Judge does not appear to be relevant or

consonant with the item recovered during this raid. A pink bag of

large size would be certainly visible. Therefore, there is a certain

amount of uncertainty as to the custody of the productions

during the said 15 minutes.

10. The allegation of the defence is one of introduction upon the arrest

of the appellant. The police party had then searched a house at

Hekitta Road, Wattala. Then, once again returned to a place at

Pettah and was on the lookout for another person. Then, they also

search the house of the appellant. There are certain

inconsistencies and discrepancies as to the time spent near Titus

Stores and the time of arrival and departure from the various

places between the witness evidence. When considering the

totality of the evidence, if a large quantity of narcotics was found

and detected from the appellant is it probable and realistic to

proceed to Wattala and then to come back to Pettah in the hope of

arresting another? This uncertainty requires to be considered

along with the position taken up by the accused in his sworn

HCC-0201-20

Page 8 of 9

evidence. The appellants position is that he was apprehended at

his fish stall. As for the prosecution, the appellant was

apprehended when he was walking towards the police party who

was waiting with the informant. It is common ground that a sum

of Rs. 61,000.00 was in the possession of the appellant. The police

party had handed over this to another. This item of evidence is

significant in considering the probability of the prosecution

version in conjunction with the defence of introduction. If the

appellant was apprehended walking along a road and a large

quantity of heroin was recovered along with Rs. 61,000.00, isnt it

normal and natural for the said money to taken as a production?

Isnt it evidence of possible trafficking? In contrast the prosecution

position is that it was handed over to a person who was there. This

has the potential of leading to the inference that the appellant was

apprehended on suspicion initially but the recovery was made

later from another place. This is just the position suggested and

taken up by the defence. Considering the totality of the evidence,

this gives credence to the defence version and in the least a total

rejection of evidence of the defence would not be possible. This is

a situation where the defence evidence is able to create a

reasonable doubt in the version of prosecution. To be precise a

doubt is created as to the mode of the detection and the manner

of recovery as narrated by the prosecution. The Trial Judge had

failed to appreciate this aspect which is in favour of the appellant.

11. Similarly, the prosecution has failed to established the inward

journey of the chain of production. The learned Trial Judge has

failed to appreciate and consider these two aspects in that light. If

these two aspects were so considered, no reasonable Court could

have come to the findings of guilt as done by the Trial Judge. In

the above circumstances, it is not safe to allow the conviction to

stand. The learned Trial Judge has erred and misdirected himself

HCC-0201-20

Page 9 of 9

in respect of these vital evidential issues. Accordingly, the said

grounds of appeal are well founded and are sustained.

12. In these circumstances, the conviction and sentence are both set

aside and the accused-appellant is accordingly acquitted.
