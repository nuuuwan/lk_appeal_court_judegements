2. Though the indictment was originally forwarded to the High Court of

Hambantota as the High Court of Tangalle had been established pending the

commencement of the trial at the High Court of Hambantota, the case has been

transferred to the newly established High Court in Tangalle and the trial

commenced therein by the Learned High Court Judge without a jury. At the

conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge has convicted the

appellants of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th,

16th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 23rd charges in the indictment, and proceeded to pass

sentence on the appellants as follows;

Charge No. Sentence

01 six months rigorous imprisonment

02 death sentence

03 death sentence

04 death sentence

05 death sentence

06 death sentence

with a default sentence of one years rigorous

imprisonment

23 15 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.20,000/-

with a default sentence of two years rigorous

imprisonment

3. The appellants being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentences imposed

have preferred the instant appeal bearing nos HCC 260 to 269/18 to this Court.

The case of the prosecution

4. The deceased, the injured together with PW3 and PW4 have been asleep in the

house that came under attack between 01.30 hrs 02.30 hrs on 19.02.1998. The

people who attacked the house, have demanded that the door of the house be

11

opened. PW3 being concerned had directed the others in the house against it.

PW3 has thereafter attempted to open a window. At that moment an explosive

device had been lobbed into the house. The subsequent blast had injured a leg

of PW3. Though PW3 had tried to hide under a bed thereafter, as his brother

was hiding under the same, he had been unable to do so. Thereafter, PW3 has

climbed up to the roof of the house and hid himself there. At that moment, PW3

had supposedly seen the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 17th, 19th and the 20th

accused among others who were initiating the attack on the house the witness

was in. The first accused had been armed with a gun. PW4 had been inside the

house when an explosive device was lobbed into the house. The blast had

injured PW4. Sometime later the several persons have stormed the house. The

first accused and some others have purportedly locked up PW4 and the other

occupants in a room. Subsequently, a person had dragged PW4 out of the room

she was locked up in and had assaulted her. PW4 has become unconscious due

to the assault. PW4 also has identified the 1st accused among the persons who

stormed the house.

The case of the accused

5. All appellants have denied any involvement in the incident and contended that

they have been falsely implicated. The 2nd and the 4th appellants have raised an

alibi.

6. When the instant application in appeal was taken up for argument, the

Learned Counsel for the appellants raised the following common grounds of

appeal;

1. The Learned Trial Judge had erred by failing to evaluate the

deposition given in the Magistrate Court by the deceased PW3

Gamini Samarasinghe though it was admitted at the trial before the

High Court.

12

2. The Learned Trial Judge had erred by failing to properly evaluate

the evidence of PW4 Wasantha Samarasinghe.

7. Upon the case being transferred to the High Court of Tangalle it has been re-

registered and the case has been allocated with the case no. HC 11/2002. The

trial has thereafter commenced and moved forward under the purview of four

different High Court Judges.

8. As stated above, the trial has commenced before the 1st Judge and the

prosecution has closed its case after the examination of eleven of its witnesses

listed in the back of the indictment. The 1st Judge himself has thereafter

considered that there were grounds for proceeding with the trial further and

has called upon the appellants and the others named as accused for their

defence. The 1st, 4th. 8th, 12th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 19th, 20th appellants and others

named as accused have commenced their defence and adduced evidence

through the examination of their witnesses. Subsequently, the defence has been

closed.

9. The 2nd Judge has been nominated as the High Court Judge of Tangalle in due

course. An application has been made before the 2nd Judge to resummon and

rehear the prosecution witnesses no.s 3 and 4. The 2nd Judge has granted

approval to the action sought by the application. Pending the examination of

prosecution witnesses no. 3 and no.4 for the second time, the 3rd Judge has been

nominated to preside as the High Court Judge of Tangalle.

10. The 3rd Judge has been informed that prosecution witness no.3 had passed

away. An inquiry in that regard has been held and the death of prosecution

witness no.3 substantiated. Thereafter, the 3rd Judge had made an order as

follows on 21.11.2016;

13

11. In consequence the evidence led in the High Court and the deposition given in

the Magistrate Court by such deceased witness had been admitted in terms of

section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance No. 14 of 1895.

12. Further, prosecution witness no.4 has been re-called, examined on behalf of the

prosecution for the 2nd time before the High Court Judge of Tangalle and cross

examined by the appellants and others named as accused in the indictment.

13. Thereafter, the 4th Judge after the conclusion of the trial, has convicted the

appellants of the charges referred to above. The 4th Judge has

observed/concluded as follows in the disputed judgment dated 11.10.2018;

(..03)

...

(..04) ,

14

3, 5, 12, 15

.

14. Though the 3rd Judge has allowed the evidence of the deceased PW3 given at

the High Court of Tangalle as well as the deposition given in the Magistrate Court

to be led in evidence, the 4th Judge when delivering the disputed judgment has

only referred to/given thought to the evidence given by the deceased PW3 in

the High Court of Tangalle and not to the deposition given by such witness in the

Magistrate Court. The 4th Judge therefore has acted in total contravention of the

order made by the 3rd Judge, as reproduced above. Further, the prosecution

witness no.4 has been recalled and cross-examined by the appellants and the

others named as accused subsequent to such witness being examined on behalf

of the prosecution, for the second time after being resummoned to give

evidence at the trial. The 4th Judge delivering the disputed judgment has

therefore come to an erroneous conclusion that the said witness has not been

cross-examined on behalf of the 3rd, 5th, 12th and the 15th accused. Such

circumstances are indicative of the fact that the 4th Judge has failed to evaluate

the evidence in total. Thereby, causing serious prejudice to the accused-

appellants.

15. The Learned Additional Solicitor General concedes that the 4th Judge has

misdirected himself when he failed to evaluate evidence properly and thereby

caused serious prejudice to the appellants.

16. The role of a Judge in a criminal case is critical, as such a Judge is responsible

for ensuring that justice is served fairly and impartially. One of the most crucial

responsibilities of a Judge is the evaluation of evidence presented during a trial.

When evidence is not assessed properly the consequences can be profound or

far-reaching.

17. To begin with, the failure to evaluate evidence properly can lead to wrongful

convictions. When Judges do not scrutinise evidence with due diligence they

15

may inadvertently contribute to the conviction of innocent individuals. This

devastates the lives of those wrongfully accused but also undermines the public

trust in the judicial system. If a Judge fails to recognise the relevance or weight

of critical evidence, such Judge may dismiss cases that warrant a conviction.

Thereby, not only deprived victims of justice but also invigorate offenders.

Improper evidence evaluation can also erode the integrity of a judicial system.

When judgments are perceived unjust it fosters a sense of disillusionment

among the public. Inadequate evaluation of evidence can set dangerous

precedence in legal practice if Judges do not adhere to rigorous standards.

When assessing evidence, it can affect future cases and contribute to a pattern

of judicial responsibility.

18. In pursuit of justice, the integrity of a legal proceeding relies on the accurate

evaluation of evidence. As stated above, when the evaluation of evidence is

flawed it can lead to wrongful convictions or unfair outcomes that undermine

the credibility of the legal system. Therefore, a retrial should be ordered in cases

where the evaluation of evidence was faulty. Such action would ensure a fair

reconsideration of the evidence adduced and uphold the principles of justice.

19. In those circumstances, I am inclined to set aside the disputed judgment

together with the sentences imposed on the appellants and order a retrial.

Retrial ordered.

20. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Tangalle for compliance.
