JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as "the Accused") was brought

before the High Court of Puttalam on two counts of grave sexual abuse against a

minor, Balapuwaduge Aruna Lakshan Mendis. These charges were filed under

Section 365B (2)(b) of the Penal Code, as amended by Acts Nos. 22 of 1995, 28 of

1998, and 16 of 2006.

During the trial, the Prosecution presented evidence from eight witnesses and

submitted three productions. In response, the Accused provided a dock statement

in his defense. Upon conclusion of the proceedings, the Learned High Court Judge,

in the judgment dated 30.05.2024, found the Accused guilty of the first charge. As

a result, he was sentenced to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs.

20,000/-, with a default penalty of three months. Additionally, he was ordered to

pay Rs. 200,000 as compensation to the victim, carrying a default sentence of six

months. However, he was acquitted of the second charge.

The grounds of appeal as pleaded by the Accused as follows;

1. The evidence of PW1 has failed to satisfy the test of spontaneity, probability,

and belatedness, hence, PW1s evidence was not credible and the learned

High Court would not have acted upon such evidence to convict the accused.

2. That the learned trial judge has not given reasons to convict the Accused

for one count and acquit from the other count.

3. That the learned trial Judge has not analysed the dock statement of the

accused in the correct perspective.

The prosecution's case, which led to this conviction, is as follows. The first witness,

PW1, Balapuwaduge Aruna Lakshan Mendis, was nine years old at the time and a fourth-

grade student. He stated that his mother was separated from his father. The second

witness, Balapuwaduge Mervin Pransis Mendis, was living with the accused. On the day

in question, after dropping the victim off at school, the accused instructed him to return

early, as he planned to purchase a bicycle for him. When the victim came from school

accused had shown a pornography video. Thereafter removed his clothes asked

him to led on the bed and placing his male organ to the victim anal. This happened

when no one was at home.

According to the victim, this incident occurred in December 2015. He initially informed

his mother, but after she took no action, he reported the matter to his brother. The brother

then contacted their father by phone, and subsequently, the victim disclosed the details

of the incident to him. PW2s father, Balapuwaduge Mervin Pransis Mendis, went to the

Page 4 of 9

school to speak with the victim and later took him to the police station. After statements

were recorded, the victim was presented before the JMO and examined on 24.03.2016.

During this examination, the victim recounted the incident, and the JMO documented it

in summary form.

According to JMO Witness Number 06 namely Sriyantha Amararathna, who examined

the victim on 24.03.2016, the statement provided by the victim was recorded in summary

form. Upon examination, the anal area was found to have three healed tears at the 2, 4,

Page 5 of 9

and 10 o'clock positions. The doctors findings align with the victim's account, as the

medical history and the recorded wounds in the report are consistent with the version

presented by PW1. While this may not serve as direct corroboration, it can be used to

assess the victim's consistency.

The counsel for the accused appellant brought to the notice of the court that when

PW1 was given the evidence, he had changed his story from time to time.

According to the evidence of PW1 in his police statement, he had not attended school

that day due to a headache. However, during the trial, his testimony changed, stating

that he had gone to school and later returned home.

The key issue at hand is whether this contradiction casts doubt or undermines the

credibility of the witness. It is important to consider that the incident occurred in

December 2015, with the witness providing a statement in March 2016, followed by his

testimony in 2023.

We are mindful of the sentiments expressed by Justice Takar J in Bhoginbhai

Hirjibhai V. State of Gujarat, AIR 1983 SC 753;

By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photo graphic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape is

replayed on the mental screen. Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall

Page 6 of 9

accurately the sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short

time plan. A witness is liable to get or mixed up when interrogated later on.

The above observation was followed by His Lordship W.L Ranjith Silva J,

in the Case of Don Kuruppu Arachchige Indika Gayan v The Republic of Sri

Lanka, CA 205/2007, decided on 16th December 2010.

Upon reviewing the entire evidence presented by PW01, we observe that no

contradiction or omission has been brought to the courts attention, except for the

discrepancy mentioned above. Accordingly, we conclude that the rest of his

testimony remains consistent.

Regarding the victims evidence, we acknowledge that his testimony was largely

consistent, and the noted contradiction does not affect his credibility. We also

recognize that PW01 provided evidence after a lapse of nine years, during which

it is natural that he may not recall every minor detailespecially those he may

have deemed insignificant. Additionally, we are mindful that victims of sexual

harassment often choose not to discuss their experiences and prefer to move past

them.

The contradiction pertains only to whether the victim attended school at the

relevant time, and it does not influence the core incident itself. In our view, this

discrepancy is not substantial enough to create reasonable doubt about his

testimony. Therefore, we dismiss the contention raised by the defense counsel.

One of the grounds urged by the counsel is that there is a delay in making the

complaint. We acknowledge the timing of the incidentat the time, Aruna Lakshan was

only nine years old and had reported the matter to his mother. However, the mother did

not take any immediate action to report the incident to anyone. According to the victim,

he felt compelled to inform his mother as he had been subjected to repeated abuse by the

accused.

Our courts have held that a witness's testimony should not be dismissed solely due

to a delay in making a statement, as long as the delay can be reasonably justified.

In the case of Dhannasiri vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka 2012 (1) SLR 268

Tilakawardane, J held inter alia;

"Two critical tests before considering belated evidence as reliable " evidence are:

firstly reasons for delay and secondly, whether those reasons are justifiable."

when considering the belated evidence or a belated statement, one cannot neglect

the basis for such delay which transpired in the evidence.

In the same case in the Court of Appeal (2010 (2) SLR 241) Sisira de Abrew, J held

inter alia;

"Because the witness is a belated witness, Court ought not to reject his testimony

on that score alone. Court must inquire into the reason for the delay and if the

reason for the delay is plausible and justifiable the Court could act on the evidence

of the belated witness."

Page 8 of 9

Further, in the case of Udagama Vs. AG 2000 (2) SLR 103 at page 107,Hector

Yapa,J held,

Counsel contended that the witness Piyaseeli had made a belated statement

to the police, 15 months after the incident. The explanation given by her that the

delay was due to the situation that prevailed in the country is unacceptable, for

the reason that her own brother Karunadasa who gave evidence at the trial and

her mother Alisnona, had made statements to the police on the very next day

after the incident.

Although there appears to have been a delay in filing the complaint, the delay is

justified. We acknowledge that, as a child, he was living with his mother, who did

not take any action against the accused. It was only later that he informed his

father.

The main defence taken by the Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant was

that PW2, the father of the victim, had brought forth this allegation against the

appellant due to personal animosity. It is important to note that PW2 became

aware of the situation through the victims brother.

The victim has explicitly stated that he personally informed his father about the

incident. The learned trial judge has rightly dismissed the allegation made by the

accused and has provided justification for this decision.

Page 9 of 9

We find no reason to doubt the testimony of PW01, as his evidence was consistent

and could be relied upon to support his allegations against the appellant. His

testimony remained intact despite cross-examination.

In cases of sexual abuse, delays in reporting are common due to fear or lack of

awareness. Considering these factors, I am of the view that none of the grounds of

appeal presented by the appellant's counsel warrant interference with the findings

of the Learned High Court Judge.

The judgment dated 30.05.2024 is upheld, and the conviction, along with the

sentence, remains in effect.

The appeal is dismissed.
