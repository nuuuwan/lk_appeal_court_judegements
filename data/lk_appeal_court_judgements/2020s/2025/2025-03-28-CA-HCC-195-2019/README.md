JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) has

grams of heroin, an offence punishable in terms of Section 54 A (b)

amended by Act No.13 of 1984.

3

b) During the course of the same transaction, the appellant did

possess 693.9 grams of heroin without a license or permission of

the director, an offence punishable in terms of Section 54 A (d) of

the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended

by Act No.13 of 1984.

Case of the prosecution

3. PW1 (IP Jayamanne) PW2 (SI Saman), PW3 (SI Mahinda), PW4 (PS50146

Richard), PW 5 (PC22369 Priyantha), PW6 (PS 60418 Samatha) and PW7 (PS

61228 Weerasinghe) have been attached to the narcotics bureau of the

police department at the relevant period of time.

4. At about 09.30 hrs on 04.04.2014, PW5 has received a tip from a private

informant of his regarding an incident involving the transport of a narcotic

substance in the Wellampitiya area. PW5 has informed PW1 about the tip

he received. PW1 has decided to conducted a raid, gathered a team of

officers which included those named above, made an out-note and the

officers have proceeded to the Wellampitiya area. The team of officers

gathered by PW1 have travelled to the Wellampitiya area in three vehicles

i.e. two threewheel scooters and a motorcycle.

5. PW1 and PW5 have met the informant of PW5 at a location close to the

Wellampitiya bridge and obtained further information regarding the person

4

named in the tip. Though the officers have thereafter engaged in

surveillance activity anticipating the arrival of the person named in the tip,

no arrest has been made. The team of officers have left the location they

were in at Wellampitiya, at 15.20 hrs.

6. When the team of officers were travelling back to the bureau, PW5 has

received a second tip. The team of officers have thereafter proceeded to the

bus stand in Wellampitiya. PW1 and PW5 have proceeded to meet the

informant of PW5 at about 18.20 hrs. The informant has appraised PW1

and PW5 regarding another incident of a narcotic substance due to be

transported in a three-wheel scooter and has offered to point out to the

officers the particular three-wheel scooter when it went pass the area the

informant and the team of officers were at that time. Then, PW1, PW5 and

the informant have positioned themselves at a location close to a bridge

while the rest of the officers have continued to remain at a location close to

the bus stand.

7. At about 22.50 hrs, the informant has pointed out to a three-wheel scooter

that was proceeding from the direction of Kaduwela. PW1, PW5 together

with the other officers have thereafter gone after the particular three-wheel

scooter. When the three-wheel scooter which the officers were going after

reached a location in Seeyawatha in Maligawaththa, the driver of the three-

wheel scooter has got off the same and started walking towards a house.

5

PW1 has with the assistance of the other officers stopped the driver and

PW1 has proceeded to examine a black coloured plastic bag that was in his

possession. The black coloured plastic bag had contained four silver

coloured foiled bags each of those foil bags had had in them two

transparent plastic bags. One enclosed in the other. The inner most

transparent bag had contained a brown coloured powdered substance. PW1

has proceeded to identify the brown coloured powder substance to be a

heroin mixed powder through the smell, texture, colour and the nature of

such powdered substance. PW1 has kept in his safe custody the parcels

containing the heroine mixed powder, questioned the driver, who was the

appellant and proceeded to arrest him. Upon the arrest of the appellant the

officers have searched the house of the appellant and discovered a small

weighing scale. Consequent to searching two other houses situated at

Wennawatta, Wellampitiya and in Bomiriya, Kaduwela, PW1 and the team

of officers have returned to the bureau with the appellant.

8. When the officers returned to the bureau, the parcels containing a heroin

mixed powder has been weighed, sealed and handed over to PW10 (IP

Rajakaruna), the production keeper at the bureau. PW10 has thereafter

handed over the parcels containing heroin mixed powder to the Government

Analyst Department for analysis. The Government Analyst has conducted

tests and prepared a report. Such report has been marked as .-44.

Case of the accused

9. On 04.04.2014, the appellant has travelled to the High Court in Avisawella

to stand surety to a person named Lalitha. After the formalities were

concluded, he has returned to Colombo and had been driving his threewheel

scooter when he has stopped at a location close to the Samantha Cinema

Hall in Dematagoda. Subsequently, some persons have blind folded the

appellant, taken him into an isolated area and questioned the appellant

about a place in which the mistress of Lalitha had hid a narcotic substance.

When the appellant answered that he did not know of such a place, he has

been assaulted. The blind fold thereafter has been removed and the

appellant taken to two houses situated in the Wanniwatha area in

Wellampitiya. Purportedly, a parcel containing a narcotic substance has

been found in the second house and the appellant falsely implicated of

being in possession of such parcel.

10. The appellant has pleaded not guilty to the charges in the indictment

hence the matter taken up for trial before the High Court Judge. At the

conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge has convicted the

appellant of the charges and sentenced him to death.

11. The appellant being aggrieved by the impugned judgment and the

sentencing order dated 05.03.2019 has preferred the instant appeal to this

Court.

7

12. When the matter was taken up for argument, the Learned Presidents

Counsel for the appellant has urged the following grounds of appeal;

i. Is the prosecution version inherently impossible?

ii. Did the Learned High Court Judge err in using a different

yardstick in analysing the prosecutions case as against the

defendants case?

iii. Did the Learned High Court Judge err in coming to the

conclusion that the prosecution version is more probable

than the defence version?

iv. Did the Learned High Court Judge err in rejecting the dock

statement without proper reasons?

v. In those circumstances, did the appellant receive a fair trial

in the High Court.

13. The appellant has been produced before the Learned Magistrate of

Maligakanda for the first time on 05.04.2014 together with a certificate to

the effect that it was necessary to detain the appellant in police custody for

the purpose of further investigations. The Learned Magistrate, has made

order allowing such application and permitted the appellant to be kept in

8

police custody until 10.04.20014. When the appellant was produced before

the Learned Magistrate again on 10.04.2014, the appellant has complained

that he had been taken into custody at a location close to the Samantha

Cinema Hall. Further, as divulged through the evidence of PW5 prior to the

appellant being produced before the Learned Magistrate on 10.04.2014, the

appellant has been produced before a Judicial Medical Officer for

examination. The report has revealed that the appellant had suffered

injuries.

14. PW1 and PW5 have testified that the appellant suffered those injuries

when the officers tried to subdue the appellant when he tried to resist

arrest. The Learned High Court Judge, has given credence to the testimony

of the prosecution witnesses and not to that of the appellant, though the

facts were capable of an inference in favour of the appellants innocence.

In Alim vs. Wijesinghe (S.I.Police, Batticaloa) 38 CLW 95, it was held

that,

Where the same facts are capable of an inference in favour of

the accused and also an inference against him, the inference

consistent with the accuseds innocence should be preferred.

15. Further, the second tip relevant to the appellant has been received by PW5

at approximately 18.20 hours on 04.04.2014. In that instance, the

informant has volunteered to point out to the officers, the particular three-

9

wheel scooter which was being used by the appellant to transport a narcotic

substance. PW1, PW5 and the informant have thereafter positioned

themselves at a location close to a bridge in the Wellampitiya area after

18.20 hrs. The informant having had very little information with regard to

the three-wheel scooter that the appellant was going to use to transport a

narcotic substance, he would have had to pay attention to each and every

black coloured threewheel scooter that went pass them. The informant

would have had to engage in such an exercise until 22.50 hours i.e. for a

period of four hours or more. Further, it being night time, the street lamps

had been switched on. Though the street lamps would have illuminated the

road, the interior of vehicles travelling along such road would not have been

illuminated by the light that stemmed from those street lamps. Being

unaware of the registration number of the particular three-wheel scooter,

the informant would have had to identify the particular three-wheel scooter

through its occupant. When no evidence has been led to establish the fact

that the interior of the particular three-wheel scooter was illuminated, it is

uncertain as to how the informant identified the appellant when the

appellant was driving the particular three-wheel scooter in such

circumstances.

16. Further, the officers have gone after the threewheel scooter driven by the

appellant for an extended period of time that night. The officers at that time

have travelled in two threewheel scooters and a motor bike. It being night

time, appellant would have been dazzled by the headlights of the vehicles

the officers travelled in, thereby the attention of the appellant drawn to

10

those vehicles. The prosecution has failed to explain the precautions taken

by the officers engaged in the raid to prevent such an occurrence.

17. The officers have also not attempted to stop the three-wheel scooter driven

by the appellant at the earliest opportunity. PW1, explaining the related

incident has stated that the officers wanted to ascertain the identity of the

source engaging in the transaction with the appellant. Such an explanation

is uninspiring as the appellant could have been arrested, thereafter

questioned and the necessary information extracted from the appellant.

18. The testimony of PW1 and PW5 being as discussed above, their narratives

are strange, peculiar, odd and unusual. The conduct of PW1 and PW5 do

not harmonize with the conduct expected of such officers, it is apparent,

that an improbable account of events that have supposedly taken place

have been narrated by PW1 and PW5.

19. An informant is a person who provides crime-related information to law

enforcement officers. They are a vulnerable category of persons. Due to their

vulnerability, the identity of an informant is concealed at all times. An

informant would be vulnerable to harm by an offender, a person who deals

or is connected with/to an offender. Due to such vulnerability, law

enforcement officers at all times take precautions to not divulge the identity

of an informant. The law enforcement officers do so by not taking an

informant to a crime scene, by not divulging personal details or the identity

11

of an informant when giving evidence in a Court of law and by not exposing

an informant to an offender or a person connected to an offender. In some

instances, security is also provided to an informant.

In the instant case, PW1 and PW5 in their evidence have stated that the

informant was with them at a location by the side of a road in which the

appellant was expected to travel on. In fact, it is their testimony that the

informant was with them when the three-wheel scooter which the appellant

drove went past them. Such an incident discloses a situation where the law

enforcement officers have not taken action to protect the identity of an

informant, which is not normal and is unusual.

20. The narratives of PW1 and PW5 are implausible based on the reasons

discussed above. The arguments present are not convincing and the

evidence should not be acted upon. However, the Learned High Court Judge

has misdirected himself when he concluded that the prosecution witnesses

are creditworthy and it was safe to act on their testimony.

21. A period of nine years have lapsed since the offence has been purportedly

committed. Therefore, it does not seem just to call upon the appellant to

defend himself again after such an unconscionable lapse of time.

In The Queen vs. G.K.Jayasinghe 69 NLR 314 at page 328, Sansoni,

J, has stated,

12

we have considered whether we should order a new trial in

this case. We do not take that course, because there has been

a lapse of three years since the commission of the offences,

and because of our own view of the unreliable nature of the

accomplices evidence on which alone the prosecution case

rests.

We accordingly direct that the judgment of acquittal be

entered.

22. Having considered the above, I am of the view that this is not a fit case to

order a re-trial.

Due to the reasons stated above, I set aside the conviction and the disputed

sentencing order and acquit the appellant of the charges preferred against

him.

Appeal allowed.

23. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate the judgment to the

High Court of Colombo for compliance.
