This approach was more definitively articulated in R v. Middlesex Justices (1840)2, where the court refused to intervene via habeas corpus on the ground that an adequate statutory appeal process existed. Over the passage of time, this principle evolved to become a cornerstone of administrative law, emphasizing both judicial restraint and respect for the institutional autonomy of administrative and quasi-judicial bodies.",

This principle has since been consistently followed, notably in R (G) v. Governors of X School [2011]4 and R (O) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016]5, where the UK Supreme Court held that the petitioners, respectively a suspended teacher and an asylum seeker, ought to have availed themselves of internal appeal procedures and statutory appellate mechanisms before turning to the courts for relief.",

Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp. (1938)8, the U.S. Supreme Court reiterated that courts must defer to the administrative process where statutory remedies are provided. This principle was ultimately codified in the U.S. Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, which made exhaustion of remedies a statutory prerequisite to judicial intervention.",
