In the event where the Petitioner has submitted documents to prove her entitlement to the land and if the 1st to 4th Respondents are not in a position to admit such position, the burden of submitting evidence in rebuttal lies upon the 1st to 4th Respondents. Rights of a party should not be prejudiced owing to a failure or omission on the part of an administrative authority. Further, it appears that the consequential actions taken by such Respondents demonstrate that they have acted, conceding the interests of the Petitioner over the land. Thus, in the given instance the 1st to 4th Respondents cannot approbate and reprobate their position. Hence, the 1st to the 4th Respondents are estopped from taking up a contrary position claiming that the Respondents cannot verify the rights of the Petitioner with the available documents. As such, merely because the Respondent failed to verify the rights of the Petitioner and to produce evidence in rebuttal, this Court is not inclined to reject the existence of the Permit P1, its contents or the rights of the Petitioner upon it. Therefore, I am of the view that the transfer of the rights to the Petitioner over the P1 cannot be denied.",
