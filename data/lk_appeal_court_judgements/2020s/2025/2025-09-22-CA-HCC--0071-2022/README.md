JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted by the Attorney General under

section 364(2) read with Section 364 (2) (e) of the Penal Code for committing

statutory rape on Rathnayake Kankanamge Madhuwanthi on 15.05.2015.

The trial commenced on 21/02/2019. After leading all necessary witnesses

and marking Productions P1to P3, the prosecution had closed the case on

23/06/2020. The Learned High Court Judge had called for the defence on

the same day and the counsel for the Appellant had moved for a day to call

witnesses on his behalf. The Appellant had given a statement from the dock

and called two witnesses and marked contradictions V1 to V5 and closed his

case.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the evidence presented by

both parties, convicted the Appellant as charged and sentenced him to 15

years rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs.50,000/- subject to a

default sentence of 06 months simple imprisonment. In addition, a

CA/HCC/0071/2022

3 | P a g e

compensation of Rs.1000,000/- was ordered with a default sentence of 03

years rigorous imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. During the argument

he was connected via Zoom platform from prison.

The Learned Counsel contends that based on the evidence offered, it is

impossible to conclude that the prosecution has proven its case against the

Appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.

The following appeal grounds were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. Did the Learned Trial Judge misdirect himself evaluating the evidence

given by PW1 and PW2?

2. Did the Learned Trial Judge fail to analyse the importance of the date

of offence in a criminal trial and thereby was there a miscarriage of

justice in the light of belated statement?

3. Has the Learned Trial Judge failed to consider that the totality of the

evidence led by the prosecution does not prove the case against the

Appellant beyond a reasonable doubt?

4. Did the Learned Trial Judge misdirect himself by not correctly

evaluating the dock statement and the defence evidence, and thereby

was there a miscarriage of justice?

5. Has the Trial Judge failed to consider the matters in favour of the

Appellant and thereby deprive him of a fair trial.

According to PW1, the victim in this case, the incident pertaining to this case

had occurred when she attended a foundation laying ceremony held at one

of her relation’s properties. After the ceremony, the victim had gone to the

CA/HCC/0071/2022

4 | P a g e

Appellant’s house and stayed the night. Although, the Appellant’s wife also

travelled on the same motorbike along with the victim and the Appellant, she

had gotten off the bike near her place of work and had only returned home

the following day. The Appellant is PW1’s mother’s sister’s husband.

After dinner PW1 had slept with the daughter of the Appellant. The Appellant

had also slept among them. When the Appellant’s daughter was fast asleep,

the Appellant had touched PW1’s body, removed her clothes and inserted his

penis into her vagina for about five minutes. As he received a call, the

Appellant had left the house leaving the victim. She has fallen asleep and

when she woke in the morning, she had seen that her aunt had returned

home.

Initially, she had told the incident to her father’s sister’s daughter PW3. PW3

had told the same to the victim’s mother but her mother had not acted upon

it. Thereafter, the incident has come to light when the victim wrote a letter

about the incident and put the same into a complaint box fixed at her school.

She had written the letter on World Children’s Day. After about a week, her

statement had been recorded by the Tangalle Police. The victim was only 11

years old when she had encountered this bitter ordeal.

PW3, Nadeera had confirmed the details in her evidence.

PW4, JMO Seveviratne gave evidence upon the Medico Legal Report of the

victim. After obtaining the history verbally from PW1, the JMO had examined

the victim’s genital area and stated that the examination revealed some

findings which are seen in sexual manipulation of vulva.

Now I consider whether the evidence given by the prosecutrix could be

accepted without any corroboration to prove the charge of rape against the

Appellant.

CA/HCC/0071/2022

In Sunil and Another v. The Attorney General [1986] 1 Sri.L.R. 230 the

court held that:

“It is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of a woman

victim of a sex offence but if her evidence is convincing such evidence

could be acted on even in the absence of corroboration”.

In State of Andra Pradesh v. Garigula Satya Vani Murty AIR 1997 SC

1588, it was held that:

“ …the courts are expected to show great responsibility while tying an

accused on a charge of rape. They must deal with such cases with

utmost sensitivity”.

As stated earlier, the incident pertaining to this case had only been revealed

to the police after the letter written by the victim and dropped in the

complaint box came to light. In that letter, she had elaborated the sexual act

performed on her. Even in her evidence she had only mentioned that the

Appellant had only kept his penis on her vagina. She was silent about the

act performed by the Appellant with his penis. But she answered ‘yes’ to a

leading question with regard to sexual intercourse put forward by the

prosecution. Until such time she was silent about the sexual act.

The medical evidence also does not specify sexual penetration. The JMO has

not given direct evidence of sexual intercourse. The JMO’s evidence more or

less corroborated the evidence given by the victim.

The relevant portion of PW1’s evidence is re-produced below:

In Iswari Prasad v. Mohamed Isa 1963 AIR (SC) 1728 at 1734 His Lordship

held that;

“In considering the question as to whether evidence given by the witness

should be accepted or not, the court has, no doubt, to examine whether

the witness is an interested witness and to enquire whether the story

deposed to by him is probable and whether it has been shaken in cross-

examination. That is - whether there is a ring of truth surrounding his

testimony.”

Under these circumstances, accepting prosecutrix’s evidence without

corroboration for the charge of rape will cause great prejudice to the

Appellant’s right to have a fair trial. Hence, I conclude that finding the

CA/HCC/0071/2022

9 | P a g e

Appellant guilty to the charge of rape is untenable considering the

circumstances of this case. Therefore, his conviction entered by the Learned

High Court Judge of Hambantota is hereby set aside.

Therefore, now I consider whether the Appellant could be found guilty to a

lesser offence considering the available evidence.

According to the facts of this case, the Appellant being the uncle the of the

prosecutrix, using his authority and breaching the trust as a guardian/

elderly relation has used force intentionally on the prosecutrix and removed

her under garment and performed a sexual act on her vagina.

Section 345 of Penal Code as amended states:

“Whoever, by assault or use of criminal force, sexually harasses

another person, or by the use of words or actions, causes sexual

annoyance or harassment to such other person commits the offence of

sexual harassment and shall on conviction be punished with

imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five

years or with fine or with both and may also be ordered to pay

compensation of an amount determined by court to the person in

respect of whom the offence was committed for the injuries caused to

such person.”

EXPLANATION

1. Unwelcome sexual advances by words or action used by a person in

authority, to a working place or any other place, shall constitute the

offence of sexual harassment.

2.For the purposes of this section an assault may include any act that

does not amount to rape under section 363 or grave sexual abuse

under section 365B.

3. "injuries" includes psychological or mental trauma.

CA/HCC/0071/2022

10 | P a g e

Hence, acting under Section 335(2) (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No. 15 of 1979, I substitute a conviction under Section 345 of the Penal Code

as amended and impose upon the Appellant a period of four years rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10,000/- with a default sentence of 01-year

simple imprisonment. Further, the Appellant is ordered to pay a sum of

Rs.300000/- to the PW1 as compensation and in default serve 2 years simple

imprisonment.

Considering all the circumstances of this case I order the sentence to take

effect from the date of conviction i.e., 15/02/2022.

Subject to the above variations, the appeal is dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

R. P. Hettiarachchi, J.

I agree.
