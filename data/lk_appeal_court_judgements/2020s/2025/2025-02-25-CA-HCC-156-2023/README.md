JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant)

has been indicted in the High Court of Kaluthara in High Court case

no. HC 10/20 on the following count;

That on or about 23.06.2018, at Galhena, in the District of

Kaluthara within the jurisdiction of this Court, you did

commit murder by causing the death of Hettiappan Seetha;

and that you have thereby committed an offence punishable

under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

2. Upon the appellant electing to be tried without a jury, the case has

been taken up for trial before the Learned High Court Judge. At

the conclusion of the trial, the appellant has been convicted of the

charge and sentenced to death.

3. Aggrieved by the conviction and the sentencing order, the appellant

has preferred the instant appeal to this Court.

Case of the prosecution

4. The deceased is a 71-year-old lady, the appellant her son-in-law,

and PW1, an eye witness to the incident, is the grandson of the

deceased. PW1 had been 16 years of age at the time of the incident.

5. On 23.06.2018, PW1 who had been at a funeral has been informed

by a neighbour that a quarrel was taking place at his home.

Thereafter, PW1 has rushed back home. When he went back to his

home within about five minutes, he has witnessed the appellant,

the step-father of PW1 physically assaulting the deceased, who was

the grandmother of PW1, initially with his hands and thereafter

with a broomstick. When PW1 asked from the appellant as to why

he was physically assaulting his grandmother, the appellant has

told PW1 that he was not his biological son and tried to attack PW1

with a coconut scrapper. At that moment, PW1 has gone out of the

house. However, when his mother brought him back into the house

instantaneously, PW1 has seen the deceased lying on the floor and

the appellant stamping on her. The appellant has left the house

thereafter. PW1 has taken the deceased who was injured at that

time by ambulance to the Bulathsinhala Hospital. The deceased

has been transferred to the Horona Base Hospital and to the

National Hospital in Colombo for further treatment. The deceased

while receiving treatment at the National Hospital in Colombo has

succumbed to death due to the injuries, on 26.06.2018.

6. PW3, Dr. Sriyantha Amararathna has conducted the post mortem

examination of the deceased after the body of the deceased had

been identified to be that of the deceased by her daughter and her

son. The post-mortem report prepared by Dr. Sriyantha

Amararathna has been produced in evidence and marked .1.

The case of the accused

7. The accuseds case has rested solely on a dock statement which

consists of just one line to the effect that the accused was not

connected to the incident referred to in the trial.

Grounds of appeal

8. When the matter was taken up for argument, the Learned Counsel

for the appellant formulated the following grounds of appeal;

i. Has the Learned Hon. High Court Judge failed to consider

any evidence that discredited the purported eye witness?

ii. Has the Learned Hon. High Court Judge not considered any

evidence favourable to the appellant when he found that the

prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt?

iii. Has the Learned Hon. High Court Judge considered the

defence taken by the appellant that he did not commit the

offence as he was intoxicated and did not have a murderous

intention?

9. PW1 has initially witnessed the appellant hit the shoulder of the

deceased with his hands. The deceased at that time has sat down

and protested to the appellant. The appellant disregarding such

protest has thereafter continued to physically assault the deceased

with a broomstick. As a result of the forceful impact, the

broomstick has broken in the process. The deceased, in that

instance, has fallen onto the ground. Thereafter, the appellant has

stamped on the deceased who was fallen on the ground, face up.

10. Subsequent to the assault, the appellant has left the house. PW1

together with his mother has dispatched the deceased who was

injured at that time to the hospital. The deceased who was

receiving treatment at the Colombo National Hospital has

succumbed to death on 26.06.2018 at 11.20 hrs.

11. PW3, Dr. Sriyantha Amararathna has conducted the post-

mortem examination on the deceased on 27.06.2018 beginning

14.00 hrs at the Institute of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology. At

the conclusion of such examination, PW3 has prepared a post-

mortem report. The report has been marked .1.

12. Dr. Sriyantha Amararathna has opined that the multiple injuries

to the head, chest and the abdomen of the deceased has caused

the death of the deceased, that those injuries have been caused by

forceful hits with a dull or blunt object.

13. The injury to the head of the deceased together with the

underlying injuries set out in detail in .1 has been classified as

necessarily fatal.

14. Dr. Sriyantha Amararathna has also clearly excluded the

possibility of those injuries being caused due to a fall. He has

opined that the injuries could have been caused by forceful hits

with a broomstick or a club. When a piece of a broomstick marked

.2 had been shown to PW3, he has stated that it could have

been used to hit the deceased in the physical assault that caused

injuries to the latter. He has further stated that the fractures to the

ribs of the deceased is consistent with PW1s version that the

appellant stamped on the deceased.

15. In those circumstances, the evidence of PW1 is cogent,

convincing, accurate, and credible. In terms of Section 134 of the

Page | 6

Evidence Ordinance No.14 of 1895, a criminal charge against an

accused can be proved by one witness alone if such evidence is

cogent and credible.

Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance is as follows,

No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be

required for the proof of any fact.

16. In Sumanasena vs. Attorney General [1993] 3 SLR 137 at

page 139, Jayasuriya, J, has stated,

In our law of evidence, the salutary principle is

enunciated that evidence must not be counted, but

weighed and the evidence of such single solitary

witness if cogent and impressive could be acted upon by

a Court of law.

Accordingly, due to the matters discussed earlier, the Learned

High Court Judge was not impeded from acting on the sole

testimony of an eye-witness, i.e. PW1.

17. Though the appellant has been under the influence of alcohol at

the time of the incident, when PW1 had tried to intervene and

prevent the appellant from physically assaulting PW1s

grandmother, i.e. the deceased, the appellant had told him that he

was not his biological son, he has tried to attack PW1 with a

coconut scrapper, he has also left the house after physically

assaulting the deceased and absconded thereafter. Such actions of

the appellant clearly demonstrate that the appellant was in a

rational mindset and that he was clearly aware of the nature and

consequences of his acts.

18. In Kathaluwa Weligamage Amararathne vs. Hon. Attorney

General, SC Appeal 130/2016, decided on 17.07.2019,

Aluwihare, J, has stated,

On the other hand, even when invoking the Section 79 of

the Penal Code in a situation of voluntary intoxication, the

burden is on the accused to establish that the degree of

intoxication was such that he was incapable of knowing

the nature of the act he was committing or that it was

either wrong or contrary to law. This was elaborated by

Justice S.N.Silva (as he then was) in Dayarathne v. The

Republic of Sri Lanka (1990) 2 S.L.R.226, where his

Lordship stated, the accused has to establish that at the

material time, his state of intoxication was such that he

did not know what he was about or that he imagined the

act to be something contrary to its true nature...If the

accused succeeds in proving that at the material time, he

did not have the capacity to form a murderous

intentionSection 79 will apply and he would be imputed

the knowledge of a sober man, resulting in a conviction

for the offence of culpable homicide.

As there was no material placed before Court to that

effect, I hold that the Court of Appeal did not misdirect

itself on that issue and accordingly, I answer the question

of law raised in sub-paragraph (e) also in the negative.

19. The actions of the appellant being as discussed above do not

establish that the degree of intoxication was such that he was

incapable of knowing the nature of the acts he was committing.

20. In King vs. Thajudeen 6 NLR page 16 at page 19, Bonser CJ

has stated,

But it was urged that they did not intend to break the

mans rib and therefore they could not be convicted of

grievous hurt. No doubt they had not in their mind at the

time they struck him their baton and with their fists any

definite idea that they were going to break his ribs or any

particular rib; but when people cause injuries to a man,

their intent must be judged by the result of their action.

They must be deemed in law to have intended what they

did.

Therefore, the Court can deem that the appellant intended to cause

the injury to the head of the deceased together with the underlying

injuries, set out in detail in .1 which has been classified as

necessarily fatal, to cause the death of the deceased or had formed

a murderous intention.

21. Due to the reasons stated above, I am not inclined to interfere

with the disputed judgment together with the sentencing order and

dismiss the appeal.

The Appeal is dismissed.

I direct the Registrar of this Court to communicate this judgment

to the High Court of Kaluthara for compliance.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

B. SASI MAHENDRAN, J.

I agree.
