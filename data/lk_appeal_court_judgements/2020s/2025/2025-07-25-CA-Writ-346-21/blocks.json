It is alleged that a majority of the employees had accepted these letters of appointment and continued their services with Fintek. However, 24 employees, including the 5th to 22nd Respondents refused continuing employment with Fintek.

But there is nothing in the contract which would enable or empower the Company to transfer, unilaterally, the right to or the benefit of his services to another legal person or entity. The Court of Appeal seems to have placed some reliance on clauses 4 of A1 to justify the transfer of the appellant. This clause, no doubt, expressly provided that the appellant should carry out all duties entrusted to him by the Company. But there is no agreement (expressed or implied) that he should obey orders or carry out duties of another company. A workman has an inalienable right to choose for himself the employer he will serve. Once the contract of employment between himself and the employer is established the employer cannot transfer his services to another without his consent or against his will. (emphasis added).",

Although alternative employment was provided by Fintek, which is a separate legal entity to that of the Petitioner, it is an employees inalienable right to choose who their employer is. If I am to accede to the Petitioners above contention, it would result in a position whereby an employer is allowed to forcefully impose on the employee, a new employer, and the first employer with whom they had a contract of employment can absolve itself from liability. When the Respondent employees received their letters of cessation of employment, it amounted to a termination. The parties were not at dispute that the division the employees were employed at is no longer in operation with the Petitioner. The inquiring officer has considered the above in the decision marked as 1R1 and has awarded the compensation under section 6A of TEWA.
