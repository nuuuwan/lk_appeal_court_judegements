Thotawatte J.

The Petitioner - Respondent - Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Petitioner)filed information by way of an affidavit in the Magistrate's Court of Nugegoda, under the terms ofSection 66(1) (b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 regarding an obstruction ofthe roadway by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents Petitioners Respondents (hereinaftersometimes referred to as the Respondents).

The Petitioner had been married to the 3rd Respondent, and during the subsistence of thatmarriage, the Petitioner had by Deed of Gift No. 1535 dated 28th February 2014, gifted to hisdaughter a land belonging to him subject to his life interest. The access to this land is from thesame roadway that gives access to the residences of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents (bearingassessment Nos 280/7, 278/4/A, 278/4/B).

According to the Petitioner, premises No. 278/4/B, which had been the matrimonial home of thePetitioner and the 3rd Respondent during the existence of the marital relationship and had alsobeen gifted to his daughter subject to the Petitioners life interest, by Deed of Gift No. 1579dated 22nd June 2002.

On or about 30th November 2016, the 3rd Respondent had obtained an interim protection orderagainst the Petitioner under the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act No. 34 of 2005, whichtemporarily prevented the Petitioner from entering his matrimonial home. This order had beencontinuously extended up to 2nd September 2020, on which date the learned Magistrate refusedto further extend the said protection order.

The Petitioner avers that upon attempting to re-enter his Matrimonial Home following the expiryof the protection order, he discovered that the Respondents, acting in concert, had obstructedthe only means of access to the said premises by erecting a gate across the roadway, which hadbeen padlocked, and by constructing a temporary garage upon the said roadway, therebyunlawfully obstructing his access.

Learned Magistrate, having inquired into the complaint contained in the said information, by herorder dated 27-01-2021 (in the High Court, both parties have agreed that the correct date as 27th

January 2022), had held that the Petitioner is entitled to the impugned right of way.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate, the Respondents had filed a revisionapplication in the Provincial High Court of Western Province holden in Colombo, urging theProvincial High Court to revise the order of the learned Magistrate. The Provincial High Court,holding in favour of the Respondents, had set aside the order dated 27-01-2021 (in the HighCourt, both parties have agreed that the correct date as 27th January 2022) of the learnedMagistrate by its judgment dated 05-09-2023.

The Petitioner, being dissatisfied with the Judgement of the Hon. Judge of the Provincial HighCourt, had filed this instant application in this Court seeking, inter alia, the following reliefs;

c) To act in revision and set aside the Judgment of the High Court dated 5th September 2023.d) To act in revision and allow and affirm the Judgment of the Magistrate Court dated

27.01.2022 in the case bearing No. 29318,e) Grant reliefs prayed for by the Petitioner by virtue of his petition dated 4 January 2021

initially filed before the Magistrate Court of Nugegoda.

The Petitioner, in his petition, has admitted that he has filed an appeal in respect of the samematter, and it was yet to be listed before this Court. When this matter was taken up for hearing,the Court was informed that the number CA (PHC) 180/23 has been allocated to the connectedappeal.

The Respondents have taken a preliminary objection to this application, stating that as thePetitioner has exercised his right of appeal against the Judgment of the High Court of Colombo byfiling CA (PHC) No. 180/2023, the Petitioner cannot maintain this revision application.

This issue has been extensively considered by His Lordship Chitrasiri, J in Kulatilaka vs. AttorneyGeneral1. Whilst acknowledging that the filing of an appeal would not be a strict barrier to file arevision application, it is stated that in such a situation, the person who files a revision applicationshould be in a position to state adequate reasons or the circumstances that should necessitatelooking at the merits in a revision application.

In Kulatilake vs. Attorney General, His Lordship Chitrasiri, J has stated;

Consequently, as mentioned herein before, the petitioner exercising hisstatutory right, filed an appeal against the said judgment. The petitionerrelying upon the same grounds filed this application also invoking therevisionary jurisdiction of this Court. Since there are two applications filed by the petitioner in this same forum,

1 [2010] 1 SRIL.R. 212

it is necessary to examine the maintainability of a revision applicationunder those circumstances. It is trite Law that the revisionary jurisdictionof this Court would be exercised if and only if exceptional circumstancesare in existence to file such an application. Moreover, it must be noted thatthe Courts would exercise the revisionary jurisdiction, it being anextraordinary power vested in Court, especially to prevent miscarriage ofjustice being done to a person and/or for the due administration ofjustice.

It is clear from a consistent line of judicial authorities, such as Rustom vs. Hapangama& Co.2,Hotel Galaxy (Pvt.) Ltd. vs. Mercantile Hotels Ltd3, Rasheed Ali vs. Mohamed Ali and others4, A.A.Mohamed Thaaj vs. H.M.U.B. Herath and others5, Indika Roshan Francis vs. Bulathsinghalage LalCooray and Rajapaksha Pathirannahelage Priyadarshani6, that the existence of exceptional orextraordinary circumstances is a threshold requirement.

Before considering this matter on the merits, it has to be examined whether the Petitioner hasurged exceptional or extraordinary circumstances sufficient to invoke the revisionary jurisdictionof this court.

Citing the case Urban Development Authority Vs. Ceylon Entertainments Ltd7, which held Thatpresence of exceptional circumstances by itself would not be sufficient if there is no expresspleading to the effect in the petition whenever an application is made invoking, therevisionaryjurisdiction of the Court of Appeal with approval, His Lordship Prasantha De Silva, J., in AyshaHameed and others Vs. Mohomed Mohideen Shaul Hameed and others8 has stated that mereexistence of exceptional circumstances itself would not allow Court to invoke revisionaryjurisdiction and to exercise revisionary powers, exceptional circumstances should be preciselyand expressly averred in petition.

The Petitioner in his petition has cited as exceptional or circumstances the following;

a) The matter is of public importanceb) The petitioner has no alternative remedy

c) The petitioner was unable to file the revision application on time due to ill healthd) The petitioner promptly filed this application as soon as he was physically fit

enough to travel to Colombo and give instructions to his lawyers

None of the above-stated grounds can be considered as exceptional grounds. Further, to statethat the petitioner has no alternative remedy when he has already filed an appeal regarding thesame matter is manifestly erroneous.

Although not specifically mentioned as an exceptional ground, the possible delay in hearing theappeal also appears to be a factor that has motivated the petitioner to file this revisionapplication. However, the petitioner has failed to convince the court that there is an urgency withregard to this matter. Even if there was an acceptable urgency, the Petitioner could have filed anapplication to accelerate the appeal instead of filing a revision.

The circumstances cited by the appellant do not rise to the level of exceptional circumstancesand, as such, do not constitute sufficient grounds for the exercise of the revisionary powers ofthis Court, and as such, I proceed to dismiss this application without cost.

Dismissing this application will not prevent the Petitioner from pursuing the CA (PHC) 180/23Appeal.
