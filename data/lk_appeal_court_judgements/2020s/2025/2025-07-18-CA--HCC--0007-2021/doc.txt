JUDGMENT

1. This appeal arises from the judgment dated 25th February 2021, delivered by the learned

High Court Judge of Negombo, by which he convicted the accused-appellant and sentenced

him to life imprisonment for the offences set out in the indictment. The accused was indicted

before the High Court of Negombo in Case No. HC 264/2014 on the following counts:

A. That on or above 3rd April 2014 at Wattala the Appellant trafficked 5.33g of heroin

and there by committed an offence punishable under section 54 A(b) of Poisons,

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No 13 of 1984.

B. At the same time during the same transaction for possession of 5.33 g of heroin

without the authority or a license as permitted by the director in terms of chapter

5 Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance an offence punishable under

section 54 A (d) of the Ordinance.

2. On behalf of the prosecution, the officers who took part in the raid, as well as a witness from

the Government Analysts Department, testified. For the defense, the accused made a dock

statement, and three additional witnesses testified.

3. Although several grounds of appeal were initially raised in the Petition of Appeal, when the

matter was taken up for argument, counsel for the appellant limited the appeal to three

grounds:

a. The Learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider that the

defense version is more probable than the prosecution;

b. Prosecution has failed to prove the chain of custody beyond reasonable doubt;

c. The Learned High Court Judge rejected the defense evidence on the wrong

premise and therefore denied a fair trial.

4. According to PW1, the information pertaining to the raid was received from a private

informant. The raid was conducted on 3rd April 2013, and the appellant was arrested on the

same day at 19:45 hours. PW1 further stated that the Heroin was found packed in a pink-

colored bag inside the right-side pocket of the appellants pair of trousers.

5. Thereafter, they proceeded to the appellants residence and conducted a search, but no illegal

items were found. After sealing the substance recovered from the appellant, the officers

arrived at the Police Narcotics Bureau at 21:45 hours.

6. According to PW 1s testimony, the Heroin parcel recovered from the Appellant was kept

in PW 1s personal locker for three days and was then handed over to I.P. Rajakaruna on

April 6, 2003, at 9:00 a.m.

7. The next witness testified for the prosecution was M.Upul Matharachchi PW2. It is

noteworthy that, according to PW1, one pink-colored parcel was recovered from the

appellant. However, PW2 testified that three pink-colored parcels were recovered from the

side pocket of the appellants pair of trousers. According to the Government Analysts

evidence, only one pink-colored bag was received for analysis. Therefore, the evidence of

PW1, PW2, and the Government Analyst regarding the detection of the drugs from the

appellant is contradictory and thereby seriously undermines the credibility of the

prosecution's case.

8. These glaring loopholes in the prosecutions case that made it doubtful as to whether the

samples drawn remained untampered or in safe custody from the time of seizure till it

reached the Government Analyst.

9. More importantly, PW2 clearly stated in his evidence that, after sealing the substance

recovered from the appellant, it was handed over to Sub-Inspector Rajapaksha upon their

arrival at the Police Narcotic Bureau. In contrast, PW1 testified that the production was

handed over to Police Inspector Rajakaruna only after he had kept it in his personal locker

for three days following the alleged detection.

10. In a case of this nature, one of the most important components the prosecution must establish

beyond a reasonable doubt is the chain of custody. This refers to the chronological

documentation of the custody, transfer, and disposition of the substance recovered from the

Appellant. It tracks the movement of the seized drugs from the time of recovery to their

presentation as evidence in court. The chain of custody serves as a safeguard against

HCC/0007/21

4 | P a g e

contamination, substitution, tampering, or loss of evidence, thereby ensuring its reliability

and authenticity.

11. To elaborate further, the prosecution must prove that the productions had been forwarded to

the Government Analyst from proper custody, without allowing room for any suspicion that

there had been no opportunity for tampering or interfering with the production till they reach

the Government Analyst. Therefore, it is correct to state that the most important journey is

the inwards journey because the final Analyst report will depend on that.

12. In this case, the evidence of PW1 and PW2, particularly with regard to the number of parcels

recovered from the appellant and the person to whom the production was subsequently

handed over, is contradictory. These inconsistencies strike at the very root of the

prosecutions case, rendering the credibility of the prosecution evidence irreparably

damaged. Unfortunately, these material discrepancies between the testimonies of PW1 and

PW2 on this vital issue appear to have escaped the attention of the learned High Court Judge.

13. Due to the aforesaid inconsistencies in the evidence of PW1 and PW2, it was no longer

certain, at the time the Government Analyst examined and identified the production in the

trial court, whether it was the same substance that had been seized from the accused-

appellant. Where the substance has passed through several hands, the evidence must clearly

establish who had custody of it and what was done with it between the time of seizure and

analysis; it must not be left to conjecture.

14. Had the learned High Court Judge paid adequate attention to the contradictions between the

testimonies of PW1 and PW2 regarding the aforementioned factual matters, the appellant

could have been acquitted without being called upon to present a defense, in terms of

Section 200(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. These contradictions give rise to the

inescapable inference that the prosecution miserably failed to prove the necessary chain of

custody to satisfy the Court that the sample packets were safely handled from the time of

seizure until they reached the Government Analyst.

15. Moreover, these discrepancies in the testimonies of PW1 and PW2 regarding the chain of

custody severed the connection between the substance seized from the accused at the time

of arrest and those produced in court during the trial, rendering the case of prosecution

entirely unreliable.

16. The object and purpose of proving the chain of productions is to ensure that what was

recovered is sent to the Government Analyst, and to exclude any possibility of mixing up or

HCC/0007/21

5 | P a g e

tampering with the production. This position was emphasized in Witharana Doli Nona vs

Republic of Sri Lanka (CA-19/19) and in Perera vs Attorney General [1998] 1 S.L.R. 378

as follows:

The prosecution must prove the chain relating to the inward journey. The purpose

is to establish that the productions have not been tampered with and that the very

productions taken form the accused-appellant was examined by the Government

Analyst. To this end, the prosecution must prove all the links of the chain from the

time it was taken from the accused-appellant to the Government Analysts

Department

17. In Mahasarukkalige Chandrani vs AG (CA 213/2009 C.A.M. 30.09.2016) Court observed:

Government Analyst Report which is the principal evidence in a drug offense is entirely

dependent on the inward journey of the production chain and therefore, there is a duty cast

on the prosecution to establish the inward journey of the production with reliable evidence.

18. The importance of proving the chain of evidence was emphasized In S v Matshaba 2016

(2) SACR 651 (NWM) as follows:

The importance of proving the chain of evidence is to indicate the absence of

alteration or substitution of evidence. If no admissions are made by the defense,

the State bears the onus to prove the chain of evidence. The State must establish

the name of each person who handles the evidence, the date on which it was

handled and the duration. Failure to establish the chain of evidence affects the

integrity of such evidence and thus renders it inadmissible.

19. During the argument, when this Court inquired from the learned Deputy Solicitor General

about the vital contradictions in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, she was unable

to provide an explanation. Furthermore, upholding the best traditions of the Attorney

Generals Department, the learned Deputy Solicitor General conceded the discrepancies

arising from the evidence of PW1 and PW2 regarding the chain of custody. When the

prosecution fails to establish the chain of custody beyond a reasonable doubt, it undoubtedly

undermines the very core of the prosecutions case.

20. Therefore, I do not delve into the evidence of the other prosecution witnesses or the strength

of the defense evidence adduced at the trial. Hence, it is my view that this conviction cannot

stand given the observable inter-se contradictions between the evidence of PW 1 and PW 2.

21. Therefore, I set aside the conviction and sentence entered by the learned Judge of the High

Court of Negombo against the appellant.

22. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the Appellant is acquitted from all charges.
