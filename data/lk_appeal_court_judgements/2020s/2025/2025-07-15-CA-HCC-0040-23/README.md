JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) has

been indicted in the High Court of Colombo in High Court case no. HC 356/17. 2. The charges in the indictment are as follows;

Charge 01 That on or about May 11,2016, within the jurisdiction of this Court, you did traffic 03.82 grams of heroin, an offence punishable in terms of section 54A(b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No.13 of 1984.

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge has

convicted the appellant of the charges in the indictment and sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment in respect of each charge.

4. The appellant being aggrieved by the conviction and the disputed

judgement together with the sentencing order has preferred the instant appeal to this Court.

Case of the prosecution

5. As of the date referred to in the charges, PW01 has been attached to the

intelligence and surveillance unit at the Prison Headquarters in Sri Lanka. His duties had included conducting body checks on prisoners who were committed to remand custody, among other responsibilities. 6. On May 11,2016, PW01 has been on duty at the Colombo Remand

Prison. At approximately 17.45 hours, a group of detainees who had been remanded by the Learned Magistrate of the Kaduwela Magistrates Court has been brought to the Colombo Remand Prison. PW01 has proceeded to search those detainees. 7. Among the group had been a detainee who has raised the suspicions of

PW01. Consequently, PW01 has directed the particular detainee to the Prison Hospital for examination by the prison doctor. Upon examination, the doctor, identified as PW07, has discovered a contraption hidden in the detainees rectum. This contraption has contained 24 small cellophane parcels which held a powdered substance. 8. Later the powdered substance has been forwarded to the Government

Analyst for examination.

9. Following the necessary tests, the Government Analyst has concluded

that the powdered substance was a heroin mixed one, with a pure heroin quantity of 03.82 grams. The Analysts report has been marked as -13.

Case of the appellant

10. The appellant has maintained his innocence regarding the incident

referred to in the charges. He has firmly asserted that he was not involved in any unlawful activity and that the allegations against him are unfounded.

Ground of appeal

11. When the appeal was taken up for argument, the Learned Counsel for

the appellant urged the following ground of appeal;

i. The prosecution has failed to prove the chain of custody

beyond a reasonable doubt. 12. PW01 in his testimony has stated that the contraption discovered from

the appellant was a rubber condom with its ends sealed with tape. Inside the rubber condom, 24 small cellophane parcels had been found. After this contraption was discovered, the small parcels had been taken out and the powdered substance within them securely placed in a single plastic packet. Such packet thereafter has been placed in an envelope and such envelope sealed consequently.

13. Finally, the sealed envelope together with its contents has been sent to

the Government Analyst for analysis.

14. In his account, PW07, the prison doctor tasked with examining the

appellant has stated that during the examination, he discovered a small parcel wrapped in polythene concealed within the appellants rectum. That parcel had contained a powdered substance. The doctor has further re-affirmed such finding during his re-examination. Furthermore, when the modified rubber condom marked -2 was presented to the doctor, he had been unable to identify it.

15. The significant discrepancy raises concern about the contraption used

by the appellant to retain the heroin mixed powdered substance; the pure quantity of heroin of which has been determined to be 03.82 grams. This also raises a critical question;

Was this powdered substance genuinely in the possession of the appellant at the time of his arrest? 16. The prosecutions case hinges on the assertion that the appellant

possessed the heroin mixed powdered substance, however, the conflicting evidence regarding how the heroin mixed powdered substance was contained undermines the strength of the argument of the prosecution. If the nature of the contraption used to retain such powdered substance or if its connection to the appellant is unclear, the prosecutions claims weaken considerably.

17. Moreover, establishing possession is important to the prosecutions

case. Without concrete evidence linking the appellant to the powdered substance, the argument against him loses its foundation. Therefore, the identified discrepancies regarding both the contraption and the circumstances of possession not only impeach the prosecutions case but also raise a reasonable doubt regarding the appellants guilt

18. Due to the above mentioned reasons, I am inclined to interfere with the

conviction and the disputed judgment together with the sentencing order. I set aside the conviction and the disputed judgment together with the sentencing order and acquit the appellant of the charges in the indictment.

Appeal allowed. I make no order regarding cost.

19. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this judgment to

the High Court of Colombo for necessary compliance.
