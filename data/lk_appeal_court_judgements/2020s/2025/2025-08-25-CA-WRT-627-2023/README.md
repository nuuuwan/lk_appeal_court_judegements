S. U. B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner in the instant Application is a co-owner of the subject land to this Writ

Application, and the other five co-owners are his siblings. The Petitioner states that his

mother was a beneficiary of the Permit (P2(a)) issued under the Land Development

Ordinance, No. 19 of 1935 (as amended) (the Ordinance) for a land in the extent of 1

Acres 1 Rood and 5 Perches and a Grant marked as P2(b) has been issued in the name

of the Petitioners mother under Section 19(4) of the Ordinance. Owing to the two

conditions stipulated in the Grant marked as P2(b), the land could not able to be divided

equally among the Petitioner and his siblings and to remedy that situation, the Grant

P2(b) was returned to the State and a new Grant bearing No. GR/21/025705 dated

08.02.2916 marked as P3 was issued in the name of the Petitioners mother for Lot

4

1651 of the Final Topo Plan No. 9 Inset No. 76 dated 15.09.1969 marked as P4 for the

extent of 0.5934 Hectares. While the Petitioner and his siblings were in the process of

dividing the said Lot 1651 among themselves, the notice dated 28.09.2016 marked as

P5 was issued by the Divisional Secretary of Thamankaduwa (the 1st Respondent) in

terms of Section 2 of the Land Acquisition Act, No. 9 of 1950 (as amended) (the Act)

notifying that lands described in the list annexed to the notice (P7) will be acquired by

the State for the purpose of expanding Kaduruwela alternative road. The Petitioners

position is that, accordingly, the State has acquired certain portions of Lot 1651. The

said acquired potions are shown as Lots 9086, 9087 and 9089 in the Survey Generals

Plan marked as P6 prepared for the purpose of the acquisition. The Petitioner states

that, according to the list marked as P7 and the Survey Plan marked as P6, the portions

of land that were to be acquired are erroneously described as paddy lands, where these

lots are actually high land. The Petitioner drew the attention of this Court that the land

in question has been described as a high land ( ) in the Grant in favour of his

mother marked as P3 and in the plan attached to the Grant marked as P4.

The Petitioner, at the inquiry regarding the compensation held under Section 9 of the

Act on 09.04.2019 (P9), has raised his concerns regarding the erroneous description

before the 1st Respondent, who was the Acquiring Officer. The Petitioner has received

a notice under Section 10 of the Act dated 07.08.2019 stating that the 1st Respondent

has decided to pay compensation for Lots 9086, 9087 and 9089 in the plan marked as

P6. The Petitioner, agreeing to the findings of the 1st Respondent at the inquiry by the

5

letter dated 15.08.2019 marked as P11, once again requested the 1st Respondent to

amend the description of the land as high land. Then, on 07.07.2020, the 1st

Respondent decided to pay Rs. 701,600/- compensation to the Petitioner under Section

17 of the Act (P12) for the Lots 9086, 9087 and 9089 in the plan marked as P6 and by

the letter dated 07.07.2020 marked as P13, an additional sum of Rs. 80,150/- was

awarded as compensation to the Petitioner. In response to the Petitioners request to

amend the description of the land in the P6, the 1st Respondent by letter dated

28.12.2020 marked as P14 informed the Petitioner that he has requested from the

Valuation Department to change the description but, the Valuation Department has

informed that the land had been valued as a paddy land in accordance with the Standard

report prepared in relation to those land plots and in accordance with the provisions of

the Agrarian Services Development Act. Thereafter, the Petitioner, on 31.03.2021, had

appealed to the Board of Review (P15) against the award of compensation marked as

P12. However, by order dated 03.05.2023 marked as P19, the Board of Review has

rejected the Petitioners appeal on the basis that the Appeal has not been filed within

21 days as stipulated in Section 23 of the Act. The Petitioner states that the delay in

filing the appeal was due to the Covid-19 pandemic prevailing at that time in the

country.

Being aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Review, the Petitioner has invoked

Writ jurisdiction of this Court seeking the following substantive reliefs, inter alia,

6

b. Grant and issue a writ of Certiorari to quash the award made by the 1st Respondent

Divisional Secretary of Thamankaduwa (the Acquiring Officer), acting in terms

of section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act (as amended) as contained in document

marked P12:

c. Grant and issue a writ of Certiorari to quash the impugned decision by the 2nd to

5th Respondents, namely the members of the Board of Review, to reject the

Petitioner's appeal in limine as morefully depicted in document marked P19:

d. Grant and issue a writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent, the Divisional

Secretary for Thamankaduwa (the Acquiring Officer) to determine and/or cause

to be determined compensation in terms of Section 17 of the Land Acquisition

Act (as amended) on the basis that the subject matter of this application is a high

land

e. Grant and issue a writ of Mandamus directing the 7th Respondent, the Chief Valuer

of the Valuation Department of Sri Lanka, to assess or cause to be assessed the

subject matter of this application on the basis that the said allotment of land is a

high land

The Petitioner has drawn the attention of Court that, in the Grant marked as P3, the land

has been described as high land, and in the Supplementary Land Description List of

Final Topo Plan No. 9, Inset No. 76, Sheet No. 42, prepared by the Survey Department

of Sri Lanka dated 16.03.2015 marked as P16, it has been described as a garden with

7

four permanent buildings and a mixed plantation. Furthermore, the 1st Respondent has

requested the Senior Superintendent of Survey, Polonnaruwa, to look into the matter

concerning the description of the land in question and to take the necessary steps, as

evidenced by the letter marked P18(i). In response, by letter dated 27.11.2019 marked

P18(ii), the Senior Superintendent of Survey, Polonnaruwa, has informed the 1st

Respondent that the land had been used as mud land in the year 1967. It has been further

stated in the letter marked as P18(ii) that, following the acquisition of the land by the

State for the road widening, only the column reserved for remarks was amended,

while the column titled land use continues to reflect the details in the old plan.

Furthermore, since the land is no longer used as a paddy land, it has been recommended

to request a new survey be conducted after an on-site inspection in order to amend the

land description in the Plan marked as P6. Thereafter, the 1st Respondent has requested

the Senior Superintendent of Survey, Polonnaruwa, to carry out a survey and amend the

land description (P18(iii)). Subsequently, the description of the land in the Plan marked

as P6 has been amended as in the column titled land use. Petitioners

contention is that under such circumstances, the granting of compensation mentioned

in P12 on the basis that the land lots that have been acquired a paddy land is irrational,

arbitrary and illegal.

When this matter was taken up for argument before this Court, the learned State

Counsel appearing for the 1st, 6th, and 7th Respondents drew the Courts attention to two

matters. Firstly, it was submitted that material facts in the present Application are in

8

dispute, particularly regarding the classification of the land in question. In this regard,

it was pointed out that the land is described as high land in the Grant marked as P3,

as a paddy land in the Survey Plan marked as P6, and later, has been amended in P6

to say that the land is a garden.

The Petitioner relies heavily on the Grant marked as P3 to establish that the lots

acquired by the State (Lot Nos. 9086, 9087, and 9089) are high land. The Petitioner

also relies on the Survey Plan marked as P16, which refers to the land as a garden,

and a subsequent amendment made to P6 marked as P18(iv), which also describes it as

a garden. Notably, the Survey Plan marked as P16 was prepared in 2015. The learned

State Counsel appearing for the Respondents brought to the attention of this Court that

the Survey Plan No. PO/TMK/2016/369 dated 29.12.2016, marked as 1R4, also

classifies the land Lots 9086, 9087 and 9089 depicted as Lot AF in the said plan as

paddy land. However, it is the view of this Court that this Court does not have the

expertise to determine that Lot AF of the Plan marked as 1R4 is in fact the Lots 9086,

9087 and 9089. The Survey Plan marked as P6 was prepared in 2018. All three Survey

Plans, P16, 1R4, and P6, were prepared by the Survey Department and approved by the

Senior Superintendent of Surveys, Polonnaruwa. According to the letter issued by the

Senior Superintendent of Surveys, Polonnaruwa, dated 29.07.2020 and marked as 1R5,

a site visit has been carried out in pursuance of a request made by the 1st Respondent

(P18(iii)) to amend the description of the land. However, it has been reported that since

road construction had already been commenced at the time of the site visit, it is not

9

possible to conclusively determine whether the land is high land or paddy land.

Therefore, the Court can conclude that the amendment made to the description of the

land in the Survey Plan P6 was made without a base. Whether the land lots that were

acquired by the State come under the category of paddy land, high land or a

garden is a material fact in determining the amount of compensation. The Petitioner

contends that there is no argument that the lots acquired are high land or garden, as the

Department of Agrarian Services, the authority legally empowered to determine the

nature of a land, by its letter dated 15.03.2021 marked as P17(ii), already determined

that the land in question is not paddy land. In the letter marked as P17(ii) it states that,

1651

. It is the view of this Court that the letter marked as P17(ii) does

not say exactly whether its a high land or paddy land, but simply says that the land has

not been registered as a paddy land. Hence, it is the view of this Court, considering the

above-stated facts, that to which category the said lots of land fall into is a disputed

fact. When material facts are in dispute, Writ Courts are reluctant to grant relief in the

nature of writs. A.S. Choudri in Law of Writs and Fundamental Rights (2nd edn, Vol

2) on page 449 states thus;

Where facts are in dispute and in order to get at the truth, it is necessary that

the questions should be canvassed in a suit where parties would have ample

opportunity of examining their witnesses and the Court would be better able to

judge which version is correct, a writ will not issue.

10

In the case of Thajudeen v. Sri Lanka Tea Board and Another1, referring to the above-

stated quoting, this Court has held that,

That the remedy by way of an application for a Writ is not a proper substitute

for a remedy by way of a suit, especially where facts are in dispute and in order

to get at the truth, it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in a

suit where the parties would have ample opportunity examining their witnesses

and the Court would be better able to judge which version is correct, has been

laid down in the Indian cases of Ghosh v. Damodar Valley Corporation,

Porraju v. General Manager B. N. Rly.

In Francis Kulasooriya v. OIC-Police Station-Kirindiwela2 Supreme Court observed

that,

Courts are reluctant to grant orders in the nature of writs when the matters on

which the relief is claimed are in dispute or in other words when the facts are

in dispute.

In the case of Dr. Puvanendran and Another v. Premasiri and Two Others, 3 the

Supreme Court held that;

The writ of mandamus is principally a discretionary remedy - a legal tool for

the dispensation of justice when no other remedy is available. Given the power

of such a remedy, the Common Law surrounding this remedy requires multiple

conditions that must be met prior to the issuance of a writ by Court. The Court

will issue a writ only if (1) the major facts are not in dispute and the legal result

of the facts are not subject to controversy and

(2) the function that is to be compelled is a public duty with the power to perform

such duty.

The relief sought by the Petitioner revolves solely around the question of whether the

land lots acquired are high land or paddy land. It is the view of this Court that this

Court cannot decide this matter based only on affidavit evidence. In Administrative

Law, by H. W. R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth (9th edn, at page 260), it has been stated that,

Although the contrast between questions which do and do not go to jurisdiction

was in principle clear-cut, it was softened by the court's unwillingness to enter

upon disputed questions of fact in proceedings for judicial review. Evidence of

facts is normally given on affidavit: and although the rules of the court made

provision for cross-examination, interrogatories, and discovery of documents,

and for the trial of issues of fact, the court did not often order them. The

procedure was well adapted for trying disputed facts. If the inferior tribunal

had to self-tried them, the court will not interfere except upon very strong

12

grounds. There has to be a clear excess of jurisdiction' without the trial of

disputed facts de novo. The questions of law and questions of facts were

therefore to be distinguished, as was explained by Devilin J. (R. v Fulham etc.

Rent Tribunal exp. Zerek).

Where the question of jurisdiction turns solely on a disputed point of law, it is

obviously convenient that the court should determine it then and there. But

where the dispute turns to a question of fact, about which there is a conflict of

evidence, the court will generally decline to interfere. Lord Wilberforce (R v

Home Secretary Zamir) similarly described the position of the court, which

hears applications for judicial review:

It considers the case on affidavit evidence, as to which cross-examination,

though allowable does not take place in practice. It is, as this case will

exemplify, not in a position to find out the truth between conflicting statements.

In case of conflict of evidence, the court will not interfere in the decision, where

there is evidence to justify a reasonable tribunal reaching the same

conclusion.

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA (as he then was) in the case of Kumudu Samanthi

Akmeemana v. Hatton National Bank and Others4, held that,

4 CA (Writ) Application No: 72/2020, CA Minutes of 30.04.2021

13

The petitioner denies having signed the said Deed of Transfer, even though the

said deed had been attested by the same Attorney-at-Law before whom all other

deeds and agreements relating to the said properties had been signed by the

petitioner. The jurisdiction of this Court under Article 140 of the Constitution

is to examine whether a statutory authority has acted within the four corners of

its enabling legislation. It is not competent for this Court in the exercise of its

jurisdiction to issue writs, to investigate disputed questions of fact. Therefore,

this Court cannot in these proceedings determine whether the Petitioner has in

fact signed the said Deed or not.

The second argument advanced by the learned State Counsel is that the Petitioner has

an alternative remedy available under Section 28 of the Act, namely, an appeal to this

Court. In response, the Petitioner contends that this alternative remedy has already been

exhausted by filing an appeal before the Board of Review. However, the Board of

Review has rejected the appeal solely on the ground that it has not been filed within the

appealable period stipulated in Section 23 of the Act. The Board of Review had

delivered its order nearly two years after the appeal was filed. The Petitioner argues

that under such circumstances, dismissing his appeal without considering the merits of

the appeal is unlawful. In support of this argument, the Petitioner relies on the following

paragraph in the case of Udugampola v. Assistant Government Agent5.

5 (1973) 77 NLR 203

14

I have given my anxious and careful consideration to the procedure adopted by

this Board, and as it appears to me even though these appeals were out of time

by one day the Board by its conduct during a period of several months has

clearly waived its objection to jurisdiction. There is no question that the Board

has inherent jurisdiction to hear these appeals. In the circumstances, the delay

in filing these appeals being a matter of procedure in my view, if the Board by

its conduct has waived its objection by delay and acquiescence on its own part

it would not be open to pursue an objection like this when an aggrieved party

seeks a bearing before the Board. Procedure should be an aid to Justice and not

a mere trap for the uninitiated

First, this Court observe that the above case was an appeal filed under the Act. In the

case at hand, the Petitioner, without filing an appeal to this Court against the order of

the Board of Review, has invoked the Writ jurisdiction of this Court. In the instant

application, the award for compensation under Section 17 of the Act was made on

07.07.2020, whereas the Petitioner had logged the appeal to the Board of Review on

31.03.2021, more than 8 months after making the award marked as P12. Petitioner

argues that the delay was a result of the Covid-19 pandemic prevailing in the country

at that time. In terms of Section 22 of the Act, if a person is dissatisfied with the amount

of compensation awarded under Section 17 of the Act, such person has a right to appeal

to the Board of Review under the Act. If the appeal has not been preferred within

twenty-one days from the date of Notice of that award, in terms of Section 23 of the

15

Act, the Board of Review shall not hear such appeal. In terms of Section 28(1) of the

Act, a party dissatisfied with a decision made by the Board of Review can appeal to this

Court against such a decision on a question of law. It is trite law that writs are

discretionary remedies and are granted only upon the establishment of grounds such as

illegality, irrationality, or procedural impropriety (vide Council of Civil Service Unions

v Minister for the Civil Service6). Accordingly, as mentioned above, the exercise of the

writ jurisdiction by this Court is confined to determining whether the statutory authority

has acted within the four corners of law. It is the view of this Court that the Board of

Review, by rejecting the Petitioners appeal in its order marked as P19 on the ground

of non-compliance with the stipulated time period for filing an appeal under the Act,

has acted within the powers conferred upon it by law. Therefore, considering the fact

that the Petitioner had the ability to appeal to this Court under Section 28 of the Act,

this Court is of the view that the Petitioner has failed to exhaust the alternative remedy

available to him. Furthermore, apart from making a general assertion that the said order

is unlawful, the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of this Court,

how or on what basis the said order can be deemed unlawful.

The Petitioner further argues that even if the Board of Review heard the Peitioners

appeal, it has jurisdiction to make only a determination on the amount of compensation

6 (1985) AC 374(HL)

16

in terms of Section 25(3) and 25(4) of the Act and the question at hand is whether the

land in question is a high land or not. Section 25(3) and 25(4) of the Act reads thus,

(3) Where the board disallows an appeal against an award made under section 17,

the decision on the appeal shall confirm or reduce the amount of compensation

allowed to the appellant by that award.

(4) Where the board allows an appeal against an award made under section 17, the

decision on the appeal shall determine the amount of compensation payable to

the appellant:

Provided that the board shall not allow as compensation to the appellant an

amount which exceeds the amount of the claim for compensation which he had

originally notified to the acquiring officer who made such award.

It is the view of this Court that the classification of the acquired land, whether as paddy

land, high land, or a garden, is directly relevant to the determination of the

quantum of compensation, as the nature of the land is a critical factor in such

assessment. When considering the above facts and circumstances, the view of this Court

is that it is not in a position to agree with that contention of the Petitioner. Furthermore,

considering the fact that the Board of Review has acted according to the provisions of

the Act, this Court is not inclined to grant the writ of Certiorari prayed for in prayer (c)

to the Petition quashing the order of the Board of Review rejecting the Petitioners

appeal.

17

Considering all the above-stated facts, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner is not

entitled to the reliefs prayed for in prayers (b) to (e) of the Petition. Accordingly, this

Writ Application is dismissed. No costs ordered.

Application dismissed.
