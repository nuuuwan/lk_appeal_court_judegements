Written Submissions: By the Petitioner 14.07.2025

By the Respondents 14.07.2025

Argued on: 16.06.2025.

Judgment On: 29.08.2025.

Dr. Sumudu Premachandra J.

1] The Petitioner, the Petroleum Dealers Association seeks writs of certiorari

quashing the decisions and documents marked "P3 (circular No. 1053 dated

05/07/2022)," "P5 (letter dated 29/11/2023 letter relating to implementing of

-Monthly Utility Fee-MUF,") and "P9 (letter dated 01/03/2024 implementing

Monthly Utility Fee), as well as writs of prohibition preventing the Respondent

and its agents from implementing or acting on these decisions.

2] On 04/03/2024, the matter was supported for formal notices and interim

orders inter parte and the court held there is a prima facie case to be looked into

and issued formal notices on the Respondent and also interim orders as prayed

for in paragraphs (i), (n) and (o) of the prayers to the petition issued till

07/03/2024 and those interim orders were extended until final determination

by order dated 29/04/2024. On interim orders of staying or suspending the

operation of these decisions marked "P3," "P5," and "P9," pending final

determination, includes preventing any deductions of Monthly Utility Fee (MUF)

arrears from sums deposited by CODO dealers for fuel purchases.

3] The backdrop of this case is succinctly as follows; The Petitioner, a limited

liability company under the Companies Act, represents CODO (Corporation

Owned Dealer Operated) dealers who sell petrol on premises owned by the

Respondent, a statutory corporation. Under existing agreements, CODO dealers

receives a 2.75% commission, lower than the 3% given to DODO (Dealer Owned

Dealer Operated) dealers. The Respondent issued Circular No. 1053 on 5/07/

2022 (P3), introducing a Monthly Utility Fee (MUF) on CODO dealers, which had

Page 3 of 20

not been broadly applied before. Following discussions with the State Minister,

a consensus was reached that MUF would not be applied from January 2023

onward, with CODO commissions adjusted to 2.5%.

4] However, by a letter dated 29/11/2023 (P5), the Respondent sought to

reintroduce MUF unilaterally. By letter dated 01/03/2024, members of

Petitioners were asked to pay MUF with arrears, failing which the amount would

be deducted from their deposits. It should be noted that the Petitioner and

several CODO dealers have instituted action in the District Court Cases bearing

Nos. DSP 607/2023 and DSP 608/2023 and sought enjoining orders, which

were issued at the very outset; however, after an inquiry, enjoining orders were

dissolved, and interim injunctions were refused by letter dated 01/03/2024.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the leave to appeal application was filed in

the Civil Appeal High Court of Colombo. It is noted that after the District Court

refused the interim injunction, this case was filed and interim reliefs were

obtained, staying the implementation of P3, P5, and P9, 4 days later, on

04/03/2024. That is the brief history of this case.

5] The Petitioner now argues that this move of the Respondent is unlawful,

arbitrary, and violates prior agreements, posing financial and operational harm.

The learned Presidents Counsel contended that this is a breach of the legitimate

expectations of the Petitioner.

6] In the statement of objections Respondent denies all allegations in the

Petitioners Petition dated 04/03/2024, stating that the claims are baseless and

procedurally flawed. The Respondent raised several preliminary objections,

including the Petitioners lack of locus standi, failure to cite necessary parties,

and abuse of court process. All these preliminary objections have been dealt

with by the order dated 29/04/2024 by my predecessor. However, the

Respondent has indicated in the written submission that against the said order

that they have special leave to appeal and it has to be supported on 25/10/2025.

Thus, this court considers the said objections in this judgment and it can be

summarized as below;

A) The Petitioner has no locus standi.

Page 4 of 20

B) Necessary parties have not been added.

C) The Petitioner is guilty of laches.

D) The Petitioner is guilty of suppression and misrepresentation of facts.

E) The Petitioners application constitutes an abuse of process.

F) The Petitioners application is futile.

G) Facts are disputed, thus no writ can be taken.

H) The Petitioner has failed to exhaust all available remedies.

I) The Petitioners conduct is dishonest and reprehensible.

J) The reliefs sought in the application are misconceived in law; and ought

to be dismissed in limine.

7] The factual matrix of the case is as follows: Respondents are the largest

importer, distributor and seller of petroleum and petroleum products in Sri

Lanka. The purpose of selling their products in retail, the Respondents has

appointed dealers. There are two kinds of dealers;

a] DODO Dealer Owned and Dealer Operated; dealer owns the premises

and equipment and

b] CODO Corporation Owned and Dealer Operated; corporation owns

the fuel station and equipment

8] The present Petitioner represents CODO dealers, the second category and the

sales Respondent pays a commission to the CODOs. The commission of the

CODO dealers, or the Petitioner, was 2.75% of all sales. That is, if Rs. 100/-

worth of petroleum products are sold, the commission is Rs. 2.75. When P3 was

brought in 2022 to charge a Monthly Utility Fee of 35% from this commission.

However, there was a rebate formula and, that, from the commission, that is

Page 5 of 20

(i) 70% of the first Rs. 500,000/- is free from the Fee. Hence only Rs.

150,000/- is subject to the Fee

(ii) 50% of the next Rs. 500,000/- is free from the Fee. Hence only Rs.

250,000/- is subject to the Fee

(iii) 25% of the next Rs. 500,000/- is free from the Fee. Hence only Rs.

375,000/- is subject to the Fee

(iv) 0% of revenue after Rs. 1.5 million is free from the Fee. Hence,

everything above Rs. 1.5 million is subject to the Fee

9] The Respondent states that CODO (Corporation Owned Dealer Operated)

dealers operate on CPC-owned or leased premises and are obligated to pay a

Monthly Utility Fee (MUF), which has been resisted by many dealers despite

formal directives issued since 2013 and reinforced in 2022 and 2023. The

Respondent says that there is no existence of any valid agreement to waive the

MUF and contends that no such agreement was ratified by the CPC Board.

10] The Respondents contention is that the Petitioner lacks authority to

represent individual dealers and that the dispute is contractual in nature,

evidenced by a related case (DSP 608/2023) filed by five dealers in the District

Court. In the District Court, although an interim injunction order was initially

granted, it was set aside on January 3, 2024, following an inquiry. On the same

day, the Respondent issued letter P9 demanding MUF payments from CODO

dealers. The Respondent argues that continued non-payment has resulted in a

financial loss exceeding Rs. 127 million since November 2023, causing a daily

loss of Rs. 4.25 million, thereby affecting CPCs financial sustainability and

potentially requiring Treasury borrowing or fuel price hikes, negatively

impacting the public.

11] Further, the Respondent disputes the Petitioners claims of hardship,

presenting financial data (R5) to show that dealers remain profitable even after

paying MUF. The Respondent accuses the Petitioner of suppressing relevant

agreements, misrepresenting facts, and lacking evidence to support claims of

Page 6 of 20

dealer losses or procedural unfairness. The Respondent affirms that MUF

deductions are lawful, reasonable, and within CPCs statutory authority.

12] On the contrary, the Petitioner says that the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

(CPC), the Respondent, unilaterally moved to impose a 35% Monthly Utility Fee

(MUF) on the commissions of Corporation Owned Dealer Operated (CODO) petrol

station dealers, which would significantly reduce their earnings. The Petitioner

says that MUF was not applied broadly and was only paid by a few dealers

voluntarily. Following negotiations between the CPC and the Petroleum Dealers

Association, an agreement was reached to reduce dealer commissions from

2.75% to 2.5% in exchange for scrapping the 35% MUF, with any past dues to

be waived subject to Cabinet approval. Despite these documented agreements

(P3, P4(a), and P4(b)), the CPC sought to reinstate the original 35% MUF, which

the Petitioner claims, it constitutes a clear breach of the negotiated

understanding.

13] The Petitioner argues that CPCs reversal violates the doctrine of legitimate

expectation, which protects individuals from arbitrary policy shifts that

disregard prior assurances. Since CPC had formally agreed to revise MUF terms,

its attempt to reinstate the original fee structure without justification is alleged

to be unlawful, unfair, and outside its legal authority (ultra vires). The Petitioner

also disputes CPCs framing of MUF as a license fee, asserting that this

characterization lacks legal validity, particularly when the CPC had previously

agreed to drop the 35% MUF. Given the documented mutual agreements, the

CPC's actions are challenged as inconsistent with administrative fairness and

established procedure. On the footing, the Petitioner seeks writ of certiorari and

prohibition.

14] Under the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act (No. 28 of 1961), Section 5E,

enacts the power of Board of Directors to authorize persons to sell, & c,

petroleum of certain classes or descriptions. It says;

5E. Notwithstanding that the exclusive right to sell, supply or

distribute petroleum of any class or description is vested in the

Corporation by any provision of this Act or any Order made thereunder,

Page 7 of 20

the Board of Directors may, from time to time, as respects petroleum of

that class or description only grant written authority to any person to sell,

supply or distribute petroleum of that class or description subject to such

terms and conditions as may be determined by such Board.[

Emphasis is added]

15] This section 5E subjected to section 5H of the said Act. It says;

5H. The following provisions shall be applicable in the case of the exercise of the

power to grant a written authority conferred on the Minister, any authorized

officer or the Board of Directors by any of the sections 5B, 5E, 5F and 5G: -

(1) Such authority may be granted either of his or its own motion or on

application in that behalf made by any person.

(2) The Minister, such officer or such Board may, in his or its absolute

discretion, decide whether to grant or refuse to grant such authority.

(3) The Minister, such officer or such Board may, in his or its absolute

discretion, decide the terms and conditions subject to which such authority

should be granted.

(4) The Minister, such officer or such Board may, in his or its absolute

discretion, decide at any time to cancel such authority.

(5) The terms or conditions of such authority may be amended, varied

or cancelled either of his or its own motion or on application in that behalf

made by the person to whom such authority is granted.

(6) The Minister, such officer or such Board may, in his or its absolute

discretion, decide whether or not to amend, vary or cancel any term or

condition of such authority.

(7) Any decision made by the Minister, such office or such Board under the

preceding provisions of this section shall be final and conclusive, and

shall not be called in question in any court whether by way of writ or

otherwise. [Emphasis is added]

Page 8 of 20

16] As seen by section 5H (7) the jurisdiction of this court categorically ousted.

However, in J. K. Anura Banda Piyarathna vs Minister of Lands and Land

Development and others, CA/WRIT/344/2012, Decided on: 20.02.2020,

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J cited with approval in relation to absolute

discretion as follows;

Wade observes (Administrative Law, 5th ed., pp. 353-354) The common

theme of all the passages quoted is that the notion of absolute or unfettered

discretion is rejected. Statutory power conferred for public purposes is

conferred as it were upon trust, not absolutelythat is to say, it can validly

be used only in the right and proper way which Parliament when conferring

it is presumed to have intended. Although the Crowns lawyers have argued

in numerous cases that unrestricted permissive language confers unfettered

discretion, the truth is that, in a system based on the rule of law, unfettered

governmental discretion is a contradiction in terms. The real question is

whether the discretion is wide or narrow, and where the legal line is to be

drawn. For this purpose, everything depends upon the true intent and

meaning of the empowering Act.

17] Further, in GUNATILEKA v. WEERASENA [2000] 2 Sri LR. 01, DE SILVA,

J. held that;

(1) In Modern Administrative Law the concept of absolute discretion is

unacceptable. Arbitrary power and unfettered discretion are what courts

refuse to countenance.

(2) (2) As the law developed certiorari and prohibition have become general

remedies which may be gran ted in respect of any exercise of discretionary

power.

18] In WICKREMATUNGA v. ANURUDDHA RATWATTE AND OTHERS, [1998]1

Sri LR, 201, it was held that;

The power to terminate the agreement without notice and without assigning

any reason did not mean that the terms of the agreement permitted the

Corporation to terminate the agreement merely because it was minded to do

Page 9 of 20

so. A public corporation must act in good faith and act reasonably. The concept

of unfettered discretion is inappropriate to a public authority.

19] In the light of section 5H (7), it is a clear ouster clause by a statute.1 One

can say that Article 140 of the Constitution, the writ jurisdiction cannot be taken

by a statute. 2Article 140 says;

140. Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Court of

Appeal shall have full power and authority to inspect and examine the

records of any Court of First Instance or tribunal or other institution and

grant and issue, according to law, orders in the nature of writs of

certiorari, prohibition, procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto against

the judge of any Court of First Instance or tribunal or other institution or

any other person [Emphasis is added]

20] Thus, it is crystal clear that the power of the Court of Appeal in relation to

writ jurisdiction is only subject to provisions of the Constitution; it cannot be

taken away by a statute. This position was clearly addressed by Her Ladyship

Shiranee Tilakawardane J. (P/CA) in Katugampola vs. Commissioner General

of Excise and others [2003] 3 Sri. L.R. 207 (page 210) where the Court has

held;

Therefore, the ouster clauses contained in ordinary legislation

would not effectively restrict or preclude the jurisdiction granted by

1 Denning LJ. in the case of R vs. Medical Appeal Tribunal ex. p. Gilmore [1957] 1 QB 574

(at p. 583) has declared that; I find it very well settled that the remedy by certiorari is never to

be taken away by any statute except by the most clear and explicit words.

2 Section 22 of the Interpretation Ordinance No 21 of 1901 as amended reads as follows: Where

there appears in any enactment, whether passed or made before or after the commencement of

this Ordinance, the expression "shall not be called in question in any court" or any other expression

of similar import whether or not accompanied by the words "whether by way of writ or otherwise"

in relation to any order, decision, determination, direction or finding which any person, authority

or tribunal is empowered to make or issue under such enactment, no court shall, in any

proceedings and upon any ground whatsoever, have jurisdiction to pronounce upon the validity or

legality of such order, decision, determination, direction or finding, made or issued in the exercise

or the apparent exercise of the power conferred on such person, authority or tribunal.

Page 10 of 20

Article 140 of the Constitution. Nevertheless, the restriction contained

in Article 55 (5) and the Amended Article 61 A as these are ouster clauses

stipulated in the Constitution itself, the powers of this Court would be

restricted by these provisions contained in the Constitution. It was

held in the case of Atapattu v Peoples Bank 1997 1 Sri L.R. 208,

Bandaranayake vs. Weeraratne 1981 1 Sri. L.R. 10 at 16, that the ouster

clauses contained in the Constitution would bar jurisdiction that has been

granted within the Constitution and would therefore such ouster clause

adverted to above would be a bar to the entertaining of writ applications to

invoke the writ jurisdiction by this Court. [Emphasis is added]

21] Thus, the contention of the Respondent that the unfettered discretion under

section 5 of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act (No. 28 of 1961) cannot be

taken as a sound argument and it is hereby suppressed.

22] I now consider the issue of Locus standi. In terms of standing (locus standi),

the Petitioner has mentioned that they have a direct and sufficient interest in

the matter, as the agreements not to impose the MUF were made directly with

it. The Respondents own conduct, which includes convening meetings with the

Petitioner and negotiating terms, validates the Petitioners representative role.

23] In the issue of locus standi under writ jurisdiction, In Premadasa v.

Wijeyewardena and Others, [1991]1 S.L.R. 333, His Lordship Tambiah, C.J.

held;

The law as to locus standi to apply for certiorari may be stated as follows.

The writ can be applied for by an aggrieved party who has a grievance or

by a member of the public. If the applicant is a member of the public, he

must have sufficient interest to make the application

24] In Wanasinghe and others (Citizens Movement for Good Governance) v.

University of Colombo [2006] 3 SLR 322 at 327- 329 also His Lordship

Sriskandarajah J. had the same view.

Who can file a writ application? The short answer isany person (as defined in

section 2(s) of the Interpretation Ordinance) who has sufficient interest as

Page 11 of 20

opposed to the outdated requirement of personal interest because of the element

of public interest. This includes a Trade Union. High flown technical objections

regarding locus standi have no place in the modern administrative law.

25] This view was adopted in Wijesiri v. Siriwardene [1982] 1 Sri LR 171,

Perera v. Central Freight Bureau of Sri Lanka [2006] 1 Sri LR 83, Jathika

Sevaka Sangamaya v. Sri Lanka Ports Authority [2003] 3 Sri LR 146,

Premadasa v. Wijewardena (Supra)-[1991] 1 Sri LR 333, Vasudeva

Nanayakkara v. Governor, Central Bank of Sri Lanka [2009] BLR 41.

26] Further, in Shell Gas v. Consumer Affairs Authority CAM 22.08.2014,

Marsoof J. (P/CA) observed;

Courts in Sri Lanka as well as in other jurisdictions have liberally

interpreted rules of standing in regard to matters of vital concern to

society....Time and time again, our Courts have repeated that the fact that

the irregularity or the grievance for which redress is sought is shared by a

large number of people or society as a whole would not prevent one of the

many affected persons from seeking relief from the court. There can be no

doubt that a consumer such as the intervenient-petitioner will have locus

standi to challenge an order or action of a statutory body such as the

Consumer Affairs Authority in an appropriate case

An association or group that seeks to represent some or all of its members

were also said to have standing in relation to the matters affecting the

interest of their members; Consumers Association of Lanka v.

Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka and others [2006]

1 Sri LR 174. In Jayathilaka v. Jeevan Kumarathunga and Others CA

1312/2004-BASL News August 2004 a person who has a long standing

association and interest in a particular field such as sports was given

standing to challenge an appointment of the Chef De Mission for Olympic

Games. A movement called Green Movement of Sri Lanka was given

standing in C.A. (writ) Application No 2047/2003 C.A. Minutes 06.06.2006

where the Green Movement of Sri Lanka having the objects of preserving

the environment and natural resources of Sri Lanka, instituted proceedings

Page 12 of 20

on the complaint of the villagers who are directly affected but do not have

sufficient resources to present their grievance before a court of law.

26] Moreover, in Wijesiri v. Siriwardene [1982] 1 Sri LR 171, Wimalaratne J.

in the Supreme Court stated;

In this connection it would be relevant to refer to the views of an eminent

jurist on the question of locus standi. Soon after the decision of the Privy

Council in Durayappah Vs. Fernando (1967) 3 WLR 289, in an Article

entitled Unlawful Administrative Action in (1967) 83 L.O.R. 499, H. W. R.

Wade expressed the view that one of the merits of Certiorari is that it is not

subject to narrow rules about Locus standi, but is available even to

strangers, as the Courts have often held, because of the element of public

interest.

27] Therefore, the contention of the Respondent that the Petitioner has no locus

standi to maintain this writ application, cannot be taken as a valid argument. I

therefore suppress the said contention.

28] With regard to suppression and misrepresentation of facts Salam J has

decided in Fonseka v LT. General Jagath Jayasuriya and Five Others,

[2011] 2 SLR Page 372, that;

Material facts are those which are material for the Judge to know in

dealing with the application as made, materiality is to be decided by Court

and not by the assessment of the applicant or his legal advisers.

29] The Respondent says that the Petitioner willfully suppressed and

misrepresented in paragraph 33 of the Petition that P5 was not issued pursuant

to a Board decision where the objection filed in the District Court Case, said

decision was tendered as V10, thus, willfully and knowingly suppressed the

facts. It is seen that the Petitioner had initiated proceedings in the District Court,

after issuing P5 and had taken ex parte enjoining orders. Although, the

Petitioner had merely mentioned about the District Court cases, it is seen, as

the Petitioner seeks to rescind P5 by a writ, it is a material fact which ought to

have been disclosed. In Namunukula Plantations Ltd v Minister of Lands

and others (SCIAp1/46/2008, decided on 13.03.2012), Marsoof J held:

Page 13 of 20

"It is settled law that a person who approaches the Court for grant of

discretionary relief, to which category an application for certiorari would

undoubtedly belong, has to come with clean hands, and should candidly

disclose all the material facts which have any bearing on the adjudication

of the issues raised in the case. In other words, he owes a duty of utmost

good faith (uberrima fides) to the court to make a full and complete

disclosure of all material facts and refrain from concealing or suppressing

any material fact within his knowledge or which he could have known by

exercising diligence expected of a person of ordinary prudence." "If any

party invoicing the discretionary jurisdiction of a court of law is found

wanting in the discharge of its duty to disclose all material facts, or is

shown to have attempted to pollute the pure stream of justice, the court not

only has the right but a duty to deny relief to such person. It is therefore my

considered view that this Court need not, and should not, answer any of

the questions on which special leave to appeal was granted, as the letter

dated 30.11.2000, which is reproduced in full in this judgement, clearly

demonstrates that the Appellant has been guilty of deceptive conduct, and

has not only suppressed, but also misrepresented material facts before the

Court of Appeal as well as this court."

30] Thus, the conduct and dealings of the Petitioner cannot be acceptable.

Moreover, after rejecting the interim injunction, the Petitioner has filed a leave

to appeal application. It is seen that a similar relief had been prayed for in this

application, and the Respondent argues that since the contractual relationship,

the Petitioner instituted action before the District Court, on failing this writ

application, it has been filed.

31] I now examine this contention. When I examine P2, that is the Dealers

Agreement for Corporation Owned Category Dealers (COCD). In that clause B 03

C is as follows;

The dealer will pay to the Corporation for the use of the said outfit a

licence fee and equipment rental as determined by the Corporation from

time to time [Emphasis is added]

Page 14 of 20

32] The above clause directly applies to the impugned payment of MUF and the

dealers are liable to pay licence fee and equipment fee as well. Thus, an

agreement drafted under the authority of section 5E of the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation Act (No. 28 of 1961) cannot be treated as ultra vires. Further, when,

I peruse the schedule, the dealer has signed and agreed as I/we do hereby agree

to abide by all the conditions stipulated in the aforesaid agreement. Thus, it is

clear that the agreement is purely a contractual one of a commercial nature.

33] In the case of Jayaweera v. Wijeratne, [1985] 2 SLR at 413 it was held

that;

"Where the relationship between the parties is purely contractual one of a

commercial nature, neither certiorari nor mandamus will lie to remedy

grievances arising from an alleged breach of contract or failure to observe

the principles of natural justice even if one of the parties is a public

authority. "

34] Further, in the case of Gawarammana v. The Tea Research Board and

others, [2003] 3 SLR 120 His Lordship Sripavan J (as he then was) held;

"that the powers derived from contracts are matter of private law. The fact

that one of the parties to the contract is a public authority is not relevant

since the decision sought to be quashed by way of certiorari is itself was

not made in the exercise of any statutory power."

35] In Galle Flour Milling (Pvt) Limited vs. Board of Investment of Sri Lanka

and another (2002) BLR 10, the Court held that;

"An analysis of the relationship that existed between the parties reveals

that as it was purely a contractual one of commercial nature, neither

certiorari nor mandamus will lie to remedy the dispute over the rights of the

parties. The purported breach of such rights and the grievances between

the parties, arise entirely from a breach of contract, even if one of the parties

was a statutory or public authority."

Page 15 of 20

36] Thus, I hold that there cannot be a writ which lies against on P3, P5 and P9

as the agreement is based on private contract.

37] The Petitioner has mentioned that on P4(a), they have legitimate expectation

to quash P3, P5 and P9. P4(a) is the minutes of the MUF Discussion held on

22/12/2022. Participants of CPD (the Respondent) and PDA, the Petitioner,

were present at the meeting. The Petitioner says that the meeting created a

legitimate expectation.

38] In Administrative Law by HWR Wade and C.F. Forsyth (11th Edition) at

pages 450- 452, the authors observe the principles related to legitimate

expectation as follows;

The phrase legitimate expectation (which is much in vogue) must not be

allowed to collapse into an inchoate justification for judicial intervention.

(page 450) As Lord Bridge in 1986 set out clearly there are two ways in

which legitimate expectations may be created. He said in Re. Westminster

City Council [1986] AC 668 at 689, the courts have developed a relatively

novel doctrine in public law that a duty of consultation may arise from a

legitimate expectation of consultation aroused either by a promise or by an

established practice of consultation. (page 451) It is not enough that an

expectation should exist: it must in addition be legitimate. But how is it to

be determined whether a particular expectation is worthy of protection? This

is a difficult area since an expectation reasonably entertained by a person

may not be found to be legitimate because of some countervailing

consideration of policy or law. A crucial requirement is that the assurance

must itself be clear, unequivocal and unambiguous. Many claimants fail at

this hurdle after close analysis of the assurance. The test is how on a fair

reading of the promise it would have been reasonably understood by those

to whom it was made. (page 452)

39] The Petitioner relies on heavily the principles enunciated in S.F. Zamrath

vs Sri Lanka Medical Council and others, No: SC/FR/119/2019, Decided on:

23/07/2019. In that His Lordship L.T.B Dehideniya J considered the principle

in depth, as follows;

Page 16 of 20

The doctrine of legitimate expectation is basically aimed at the prevention

of administrative authorities from abusing their discretionary powers

against the legitimate expectations of individuals, which have been

engineered by the prior conduct of the authorities. The Petitioner has

studied in a university which has been duly recognized by the 1st

Respondent. It is evident that, the 1st Respondents act of recognizing the

university has engineered a legitimate expectation of the Petitioner. The

legitimate expectation of a person ensures that, the administrative

authorities are bound by their undertakings and assurances unless there

are compelling reasons to change the policy subsequently. It further ensures

legal certainty which is imperative as the people ought to plan their lives,

secure in the knowledge of the consequences of their actions. The perception

of legal certainty deserves protection, as a basic tenet of the rule of law

which this court attempts to uphold as the apex court of the country. The

public perception of legal certainty becomes negative when the authorities

by their own undertakings and assurances have generated legitimate

expectations of people and subsequently by their own conduct, infringe the

so generated expectations.

Lord Denning has stated that, (in Recent Development in the Doctrine of

consideration) A man should keep his words. All the more so when

promise is not a bare promise but is made with the intention that the other

party should act upon it. The principle of legitimate expectation is connected

with an administrative authority and an individual. It emerges in an

instance where an administrative authority affects a person by depriving

him of some benefit or an advantage which he had been in the past been

permitted by the decision maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately

expect to be permitted to continue. Thus as an essence, administrative

authority must respect the expectations. There are essential ingredients of

legitimate expectation. Some are:

a) The doctrine imposes a duty on the administrative body to afford

an opportunity of hearing to the affected party, before acting contrary

to the latters legitimate expectation.

Page 17 of 20

b) The doctrine extends the protection of natural justice or fairness to

the exercise of non-statutory administrative powers where the

interest affected is only an expectation, a privilege or a benefit.

c) The doctrine applies to make a public authoritys decision making

process fair.

d) A person may derive the legitimate expectation of receiving a

benefit or privilege as a matter of public law even where that person

has no legal right to it.

e) An individual can claim a benefit or privilege under the doctrine of

legitimate expectation only when such expectation is reasonable.

f) The doctrine extends to the exercise of non-statutory powers.

g) The doctrine of legitimate expectation would arise from an express

promise or existence of a regular practice.

40] Further, in Wickremaratne v. Jayarathne [2001] 3 Sri L R 161, Justice

Gunawardena held that;

The doctrine of legitimate expectation is not limited to cases involving a

legitimate expectation of a hearing before some right or expectation was

affected, but is also extended to situations even where no right to be heard

was available or existed but fairness required a public body or official to act

in compliance with its public undertakings and assurances. Simon Brown

LJ explained this aspect in R. v. Devon Country Council, ex parts Baker and

another in which the concept of legitimate expectation was used to refer to

the fair procedure itself i.e. that the applicant claims to have a legitimate

expectation that public authority will act fairly towards him. It is not

procedurally fair for the State to have promised the petitioner an extent of

land 2RR 21 PP in extent upon his surrendering the balance land and then

proceed to acquire the whole of the land without the petitioner being given

any opportunity to make representations

As the apex court of the country, this court encourages the flexibility and

adaptability of the administrative authorities in making policies and taking

decisions, but still, insists on the fact that such conduct should not be used

unfair and arbitrary

The main function of this court in this type of case is to strike a balance

between ensuring an administrative authoritys ability to change its policies

when required, and make sure that in doing so they do not defeat the

legitimate expectations of individuals by acting unfairly and arbitrarily

The legitimate or reasonable expectation arises from an express promise

given on behalf of a public authority or from the existence of a regular

practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue. This court

decides that, the expectation which is defined in the domain of this doctrine

is not merely an anticipation. It is not just a wish, desire, hope, a claim or

any kind of a demand. The legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred, if

it is founded on the sanction of a law or custom or assurance or an

established procedure by a public authority

41] In the instant case, the meeting was presided by a State Minister, not the

Cabinet Minister to the pertinent subject. This meeting was held on 22/12/2022

and it has bearing on the P49b), 38/1279 of 21/06/2023 Board Paper. In that

the Board mentioned subsequent to P4(a) meeting, some members of the

Petitioners have instituted legal proceedings in the Commercial High Court and

the District Court. Thus, it is not the respondent, the Petitioner disobeyed the

settlement. Once the conditions of the settlement are denounced by the

Petitioner, the Petitioner cannot have any legitimate expectation on the

settlement once he failed in the law suit. When applying the above stated

principles to the instant case though an assurance was given by the Respondent,

it is to be subjected to the Cabinet Approval and the Cabinet Minister has not

given any undertaking on approval. Thus, this court is of the view on this footing,

since the Petitioner has instituted legal proceedings against the Respondent on

a contract in the Commercial High Court and District Court, and the P4(a) is

merely a meeting, there is no chance to create legitimate expectation on the said

P4(a) meeting. If the said P4(a) undertaking was breached by the Respondent, it

Page 19 of 20

is dubious why a writ of Mandamus was filed instead of filing civil suits. In that

sense, the Petitioner is too late to file this application.

42] On the other hand, if the Petitioner relies on P4(a), why the specific

performance has not been pleaded in the civil suits, instead of praying for

invalidation of P3 and P5. This shows that facts are disputed by the parties and

amongst the dealers, members of the Petitioners.

43] In the case of Thajudeen vs Sri Lanka Tea Board and another [1981] 2

SLR 471 Ranasinghe J. held;

"that the remedy by way of an application for a Writ is not a proper

substitute for a remedy by way of a suit, specially where facts are in

dispute and in order to get at the truth, it is necessary that the questions

should be canvassed in a suit where the parties would have ample

opportunity of examining their witnesses and the Court would be better able

to judge which version is correct, has been laid down in the Indian cases

of: Ghosh v. Damodar Valley Corporation, Porraju v. General Manager B. N.

Rly."

44] In the case of W.M.Karunawathie and others v A.H.Pemawathie and

others (CA (Writ) 452/2008) Anil Gooneratne J. held that;

"When facts are disputed, court should be cautious and refrain from

interfering by way of granting a prerogative writ. This is a discretionary

remedy of court. Given the powers of such a remedy, the Common Law

surrounding this remedy requires multiple conditions that must be met prior

to issuance of a writ by court

45] I note the notion that Lord Diplock held in Council of Civil Service Unions

vs Minister for the Civil Service 1985 AC 374. He notes;

"Judicial review has I think developed to a stage today when without

reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come

about, one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds upon

which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. The first

Page 20 of 20

ground I would call 'illegality', the second 'irrationality' and the third

'procedural impropriety'.

46] I cannot see any illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety in the

decision sought to be quashed.

47] This court further notes where His Lordship Marsoof J held in Ratnasiri

and others v. Ellawala and others (2004) SLR 180. His Lordship held;

"This court is mindful of the fact that the prerogative remedies it is

empowered to grant in these proceedings are not available as of right. Court

has a discretion in regard to the grant of relief in the exercise of its

supervisory jurisdiction

48] In the above circumstances, we see no merit in this application. Thus, the

application for writ of certiorari and prohibition is dismissed with costs.
