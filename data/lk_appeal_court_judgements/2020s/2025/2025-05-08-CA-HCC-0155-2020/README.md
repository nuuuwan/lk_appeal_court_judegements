JUDGEMENT

1. The appellant was indicted for committing the murder of Kandasamy

Rajendran and after a trial before the Judge, the appellant was found

guilty as charged, convicted and sentenced to death. This appeal is

preferred against the said conviction and sentence.

2. The appellant has raised several grounds of appeal in the petition of

appeal and their written submission. However, when this matter was

taken up for appeal, the learned Counsel did not pursue with all the

said grounds of appeal. Accordingly, this appeal will be considered on

the following grounds of appeal:

i. the Trial Judge failed to consider the absence of evidence

to prove the intention under the 3rd limb of Section 294

read with 296 of the Penal Code;

ii. the Trial Judge failed to consider the contradictions and

omissions per se, and inconsistencies inter se; and

iii. the Trial Judge failed failure to consider and or evaluate

the dock statement.

Facts

3. The prosecution relies on the evidence of two eyewitnesses PW-1,

Karuppaiya Sittu and PW-2, Ponnasamy Devika. The facts of this

incident as emanating from the said witnesses may be summarized as

HCC-0155-20

Page 3 of 17

follows. The witnesses, the appellant as well as the deceased were all

line-room occupants in a plantation and are related to each other. The

appellant and the deceased are brothers-in-law. The deceased was

married to the first cousin of the appellant. PW-1 happened to be the

mother-in-law of the deceased and an aunt of the appellant. PW-2 is

the cousin sister of the appellant and the sister-in-law of the deceased.

The crux of the evidence of PW-1 is that when she was in her line room,

maybe between 4:00 and 6:00 PM, she had seen the appellant walking

with an axe. The appellant had waited somewhat concealed and then

alighted 2-3 blows on the deceased with the axe. The deceased had then

fallen, and the appellant had left.

4. PW-2 testified that the appellant had come to her line room and said

that he cut and chopped the deceased. ( ).

Then, the appellant had gone towards the deceased who had fallen and

dealt two more blows with the axe. The deceased had then been taken

to the local hospital at Kalutara but transferred to the General Hospital

of Colombo. However, upon being transferred, he succumbed to his

injuries during the early hours of the following morning just as he was

being prepared for surgery.

Ground of Appeal No.1 - The Trial Judge failed to consider the absence

of evidence to prove the intention under the 3rd limb of Section 294 read

with 296 of the Penal Code.

5. Though not raised as a ground of appeal in the written submissions,

the main ground of appeal advanced during the argument is the

apparent absence of the murderous intention and the failure to prove

the same. The argument is twofold. Firstly, that the deceased had not

received any treatment immediately and he had died towards the early

hours of the following morning after the lapse of some time and that

there is no evidence to prove that the injuries carry a high antecedent

probability of causing death. Then it was submitted that the main

injuries to the head and the abdomen as observed by the pathologist

HCC-0155-20

Page 4 of 17

were blunt force trauma injuries. According to the pathologist, these

fatal injuries were probably caused by handle-end of an axe. The

argument is that the appellant acted with a murderous intention one

would expect him to have directly attacked with the sharp end of the

axe. Therefore, the evidence does not establish the murderous

intention.

6. The medical evidence becomes relevant in view of this argument. The

prosecution has called and led the evidence of the pathologist, Prof.

Sarathchandra Kodikara. The prosecutor by and large has merely led

the contents of the Post-Mortem Report (PMR) through the pathologist.

No doubt, the description of the injuries as observed has been elicited.

However, the prosecutor had failed to elicit the effect, degree and the

seriousness of the injuries; the prosecutor has not directly elicited if

these injuries are necessarily fatal, or to that matter, if they are

sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death or if they carry

a high antecedent probability of causing death. Based on this, the

Counsel for the appellants argued that the prosecution has not proved

the requisite murderous intention to come within the four limbs of

Section 294 of the Penal Code.

7. The Penal Code defines murder in Sections 293 and 294. Murder is the

acceleration of death where the act by which the death is caused is

done; with the intention of causing death or; with the intention of

causing bodily injury and the injury inflicted is very likely to cause

death in the ordinary course of nature or; with the knowledge of the

imminent danger of death being caused in all probabilities.

8. I observe that the prosecutor, whilst leading medical evidence has

basically elicited the description of the injuries as described in the

PMR. There is a failure to elicit from the pathologist the effect, nature

and the degree of the injuries and the opinion if the injuries observed

on the deceased are sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause

death or if there is a high antecedent probability of death being caused.

HCC-0155-20

Page 5 of 17

9. According to the medical evidence, the deceased has clearly sustained

extensive blunt force trauma to the head and abdomen. According to

the pathologist, the skull had compound fractures and correspondingly

the brain matter dura and sub dura had injuries of a serious nature.

10. The said injuries on the head are injuries No. 1A and 1B as referred to

in the PMR. Both these are linear lacerations externally, with

corresponding underlying depressed compound commuted fractures,

and with linear fractures running down to the base of the skull.

Correspondingly, the pathologist has observed sub-dural haemorrhage

(internal bleeding) in the head with cerebral oedema, meaning damage

to the brain matter and a shifting of the brain to the left. In his opinion,

these head injuries have been caused due to blunt force trauma with a

heavy weapon and substantive force. In his opinion, it probably may

have been by the handle end of an axe-head.

11. The pathologist has then explained as to how the death will be caused

by these two injuries. According to him, with the internal bleeding, the

brain is subject to pressure, which affects the breathing, heartbeat, and

thereby, causes a cessation of breathing and the functions of the heart.

This had resulted in the death. The cause of death according to the PMR

is primarily the cranio-cerebral injuries due to blunt force trauma. This

is due to injury No. 1A and 1B. In addition thereto, a second cause is

also referred to as being haemorrhagic shock due to liver laceration and

blood aspiration. Injury No. 7 is observed on the right side of the

anterior abdominal wall. Corresponding to this injury, a rupture of the

liver has also been observed. This injury is attributed to blunt force

trauma, probably caused by the blunt end of an axe.

12. It was argued that there is no evidence that these injuries are

necessarily fatal or there is a high degree of death being caused. It was

also submitted that if the appellant acted with a murderous intention,

one would expect him to have used the cutting end of the axe to inflict

HCC-0155-20

Page 6 of 17

the injuries. Based on this argument, it is submitted that the

prosecution has failed to prove the intention as required by any one of

the four limbs of Section 294 of the Penal Code.

13. To come within the 3rd limb of Section 294, it is sufficient to say that it

is murder, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the

intention of causing death or bodily injury of a sort that is likely to

cause death.

14. On a perusal of the medical evidence, it is apparent that the prosecutor

has certainly failed to elicit the exact nature and the degree of the

injuries and their probable effect in the direct form. Certainly, the

prosecutor has been remiss or negligent in the extreme. However, from

the available evidence the fact that at least three blows have been dealt

on the head and the abdomen using extensive force is established. The

eyewitnesses clearly state that the weapon used was an axe. No doubt,

the production (the axe) had not been shown to the eyewitnesses.

Unfortunately, the prosecutor has been remiss and negligent here too.

However an axe, which was a production, had been shown to the

pathologist, who expressed the opinion that these injuries would most

probably have been caused by such an axe. Though the eyewitnesses

were not shown the axe, they have both clearly described the weapon

used to be an axe. Therefore, the fact that the appellant used an axe to

attack and inflict the injuries on the deceased, is well established by

the oral evidence of the eyewitnesses. An axe is a known weapon and

the description may suffice. The failure to produce the real evidence or

the material production thus does not in any way diminish the value of

the oral testimony of the witnesses. Therefore, the failure to show the

production to the eyewitnesses PW-01 and PW-02, does not affect the

finding of the learned Trial Judge that the appellant did attack the

deceased using an axe.

15. That being so, the pathologist corroborates the fact that the fatal injuries

may be inflicted by the use of the blunt side of an axe. It is the evidence

HCC-0155-20

Page 7 of 17

of the pathologist that the death was primarily caused due to the head

injuries. He had explained the process by which death results due to the

direct effect and consequence of injuries No. 1A and 1B.

16. The argument advanced on behalf of the appellant is that there was a

delay in obtaining the required medical attention, and this resulted in

the death of the deceased. According to the totality of the evidence, the

appellant had dealt multiple blows on the head, neck, and abdomen

using an axe. The pathologist confirms that the injuries No. 4, 11, and

12, found on the forearm and the hands of the deceased, are probably

defence injuries. This inferentially establishes that the deceased had

made an attempt to wade off the blows, but despite his effort, the

appellant had succeeded in inflicting blows with extreme force. When a

person uses the blunt side (the handle end of the axe head) and directs

the blows to the head and the abdomen, the only intention that is

inferentially possible is that he intends at least to cause bodily injury to

the victim. The medical evidence confirms that the said injuries No. 1A

and 1B did cause his death notwithstanding the immediate attention of

blood transfusion and saline being given. The deceased had died around

05:45 AM at 04.08.2006. This is approximately within 12 hours of

sustaining the injuries. As explained by the pathologist, the death has

been so caused as a direct consequence of the brain damage, affecting

the functions of the heart and the lung. Therefore, even if there was no

medical intervention, it is established without any doubt that the nature

of the head injuries was such that it was sufficient in the ordinary course

of nature to cause the death. Accordingly, the evidence has clearly

established that the appellant had acted with the intention of causing

bodily injury and the injury so inflicted was sufficient in the ordinary

course of nature to cause the death of the deceased. This comes within

the 3rd limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code.

17. In the post argument written submission, the appellant submits that the

medical evidence reveals that there was a scuffle or a fight between the

assailant and the deceased. On the perusal of the medical evidence,

HCC-0155-20

Page 8 of 17

there are certain defence injuries in the hands and the forearm of the

deceased as opined by the pathologist. There is no suggestion or any

other evidence of a sudden fight between the appellant and the deceased.

When the person is attacked with a weapon it is quite normal and

natural for such person to defend himself. The injuries as observed as

defence injuries are no more than injuries so caused. There is absolutely

no evidence of any degree indicative or suggestive of a sudden fight. This

submission is totally baseless and misconceived.

18. The appellant relies on the Judgement of Justice Sisira De Abrew in

Vinitha and Another vs. Republic of Sri Lanka 2007 (1) SLR 169 in

which His Lordship held that, the intention contemplated in the 3rd

limb of sec. 294 is the intention to inflict a bodily injury. According to 3rd

limb of sec. 294, this injury must be sufficient to cause death in the

ordinary course of nature. The emphasis in the 3rd limb of sec. 294 is on

the sufficiency of the injury in ordinary course of nature to cause death.

The sufficiency is the high probability of death in the ordinary course of

nature which evidence must be elicited from the doctor who conducted the

post-mortem who is called upon to express an opinion on the post-mortem

report.

19. It is true and correct that the prosecutor has been negligent and has

failed to directly elicit the evidence of sufficiency that of the high

probability of death been caused in the ordinary course of nature. Ninian

Jayasooriya J., in Sumanasiri Vs. Attorney General, 1999 (1) SLR 309

also held a similar view as follows:

Clause 3 of Section 294 requires that the probability of death

resulting from the injury inflicted was not merely likely but very

great though not necessarily inevitable.

20. It is true that medical evidence as to the effect and the likely result of

the injury should be elicited from the pathologist. However, the first

requirement under limb 3 is that the accused has acted with the

intention of causing bodily injury. The appellant has clearly dealt

HCC-0155-20

Page 9 of 17

several blows on vital areas (head and abdomen) with a heavy

instrument; an axe. This evidence sufficiently proves the subjective

intention being none other than to cause bodily injury. There simply

cannot be any other reasonable inference or hypothesis. As to the

sufficiency in the ordinary course of nature to cause death is required

to be considered objectively (vide Farook vs. Attorney General). It was

held as follows:

The third clause discards the test of subjective knowledge. It deals

with acts done with the intention of causing bodily injury to a

person and the bodily injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of

nature to cause death. In this clause the result of the intentionally

caused injury must be viewed objectively. If the injury that the

offender intends causing and does cause is sufficient to cause

death in the ordinary way of nature the offence is murder whether

the offender intended causing death or not and whether the

offender had a subjective knowledge of the consequences or not.

21. Accordingly, the operative element of limb 3 of Section 294 is the

intention of the appellant to cause bodily injury. As to the nature of the

injury there is no requirement of proving that the appellant had the

subjective knowledge of its consequences. This limb appears to have

been formulated based on the presumption that the person intends the

natural and probable consequences of his conduct. Hence, when the

appellant intends to cause bodily injury, it shall be presumed that he

also intends natural and probable consequences of such injury so

inflicted. In Chandrasena vs. Attorney General (2008) 2 SLR 255, the

ingredients to establish murder under limb 3 of Section 294 are as

follows;

i. The accused inflicted a bodily injury to the victim;

ii. The victim died as a result of the above bodily injury;

iii. The accused had the intention to cause the above bodily

injury;

HCC-0155-20

Page 10 of 17

iv. The above injury was sufficient to cause the death of the

victim in the ordinary course of nature.

22. Now applying the objective test to the sufficiency of the injuries, judicial

authority holds that it should be elicited from the doctor who conducted

the post-mortem. The prosecutor in this appeal has not elicited this fact

directly in that form. However, medical evidence was led to prove that

the injuries to the head was of such a nature that it has damaged the

cranio-cerebral matter of the victim. Correspondingly, the process of the

death been caused due to such an injury was explained by the doctor.

Such injury directly affects the heartbeat as well as the lung functions.

As argued, the deceased had succumbed to the injuries during the early

hours of the following day during which period it is alleged that medical

attention was not received promptly. The doctors evidence is that the

death resulted shortly before the deceased was to be taken in for

surgery. It is in evidence that he was receiving immediate medical

attention prior to that. Considering the totality of this evidence the only

inference is that the death of the deceased was due to the blunt force

trauma caused by the blows dealt by the appellant. When the heart

function as well as the lung function are both affected, it is obvious and

apparent that the likelihood of death being caused is very great. The

pathologist in his evidence clearly explains this basis of causing the

death. Therefore, the evidence is sufficient to establish that the injuries

inflicted on the deceased carries a very high probability of causing the

death.

23. Further as testified by PW-02 Devika, the appellant had come to their

house and stated that he had attacked and killed the deceased (

). This is an admission that amounts to

confession, which is admissible and relevant against the appellant.

After so informing, the appellant is alleged to have gone back and dealt

further blows on the deceased who was on the ground. This buttresses

and further confirms that the appellant was clearly actuated and acting

with a murderous intention. The blows be it with the handle end or the

HCC-0155-20

Page 11 of 17

cutting end makes little difference when several blows are aimed on the

head with substantial force with a heavy weapon like that of an axe.

The appellant himself in his dock statement admits the axe he had at

that time was heavy.

Ground of Appeal No. 02 - The Trial Judge failed to consider the

contradictions and omissions per se and inconsistencies inter se.

24. At this juncture, it is opportune to consider the next argument of the

contradictions inter se between PW-01 and PW-02. That PW-01 does not

confirm or testify as to the second attack. PW-01 is the witness who had

seen the commencement and the initial attack. She had seen the

appellant positioning himself in a concealed manner and then throwing

two or three blows at the deceased using an axe. It is thereafter that the

appellant appears to have gone up to PW-02s house and made the

aforesaid admission. Having so stated the appellant was seen by PW-02

proceeding to the fallen deceased and throwing several more blows with

the axe. It is argued that PW-01 does not speak as to the second round

of attack. Therefore, the evidence of the two witnesses cannot exist

together. The place of incident is within the vicinity of the two line rooms

in which the two witnesses were at the time of the incident. PW-01 had

seen the initial attack from her line room. The second incident as

narrated by PW-02, takes place shortly thereafter, in quick succession.

The victim has been on the ground on a somewhat uneven ground of at

a lower elevation (a ditch), which PW-01 narrates as follows:

, ,

. (Emphasis added.)

25. Therefore, in all probabilities, the second attack may have not been

within the sight and seeing of PW-01 as the deceased was on the ground

and was at a lower level. If so, how was PW-01 able to see the initial

attack? It is simply that the victim was upright and walking when he

was initially attacked. In that position, the blows alighting on the head

HCC-0155-20

Page 12 of 17

would certainly be visible even from a short distance away, where PW-

01 claims to have been. Therefore, there is no contradiction or

inconsistency inter se as argued. Accordingly, this argument is

misconceived, and I see no merit in the same.

Ground of Appeal No. 03 - The Trial Judge failed to consider and or

evaluate the dock statement.

26. The appellant had made a brief dock statement, according to which he

admits meeting the deceased around 7:30 PM, and having several axes

in his possession. He also admits that the deceased did try to get into

an argument with him, however, claims that he did not engage with the

deceased but avoided him and proceeded home. Later on, he had heard

some people shouting and learnt that the deceased was taken to

hospital. Accordingly, he denied assaulting the deceased.

27. The Trial Judge had adverted to the fact of the appellant making the

dock statement and summarised it at page 31 of the judgement. The

Trial Judge has clearly said that he would be considering the dock

statement in determining this matter. It was argued that the Trial Judge

has only considered that which is favourable to the prosecution and not

evaluated the dock statement in its correct context and perspective. The

appellant relies on the judgement of Queen vs. Kularatne 75 NLR 259,

and several other cases, which followed the said decision, in support of

the appellants argument where it was held that that:

when an unsworn statement is made by the accused from the

dock, the jurors must be informed that such statement must be

looked upon as evidence, subject however to the infirmity that the

accused had deliberately refrained from giving sworn testimony.

But the jury must also be directed that (a) if they believe the

unsworn statement it must be acted upon, (6) if it raises a

reasonable doubt in their minds about the case for the prosecution,

the defence must succeed, and (e) that it should not be used

against another accused.

HCC-0155-20

Page 13 of 17

28. On a perusal of the judgement, it is apparent that the Trial Judge has

not considered the dock statement separately and determined if the said

dock statement creates any doubt or to that matter, there is no express

rejection of the dock statement. To that extent, the ground raised

appears to have some merit.

29. In this backdrop, I would consider the effect of the dock statement in the

context of the totality of the prosecution evidence. The sum total of the

dock statement is one of denial. Whilst admitting his presence at or

about the time the incident took place and meeting the deceased, his

position is that he proceeded to his house, avoiding any confrontation

with the deceased. In the same breath, the appellant claims to have

heard some commotion, and finding out that the deceased was taken to

hospital and the appellant then decides to leave and abscond. The police

evidence confirms that the appellant did so abscond. The appellant and

the deceased are close relatives living in the same neighbourhood. They

work together on a regular basis. The appellant claims that he had no

previous enmity with the deceased.

30. That being so, is it natural and normal to have surreptitiously so left?

As I see, there is no reason or rationale for the appellant to avoid and

leave in that manner as claimed. In the normal course of events, one

would expect the appellant to have rushed to the assistance of his

relative. It is specially so if he happened to hear or see him in trouble.

This sequence of events and the position taken up by the appellant is

inherently improbable and contrary to the normal course of conduct of

any rational person. Thus, the dock statement is inherently improbable,

it must in all probabilities be false.

31. Then it is also relevant that the events as narrated in the dock statement

have not been suggested to any of the prosecution witnesses. That being

so, the position so taken up by the appellant in his dock statement lacks

consistency. On the other hand, the appellant having made a dock

HCC-0155-20

Page 14 of 17

statement had completely failed to explain the incriminating evidence

that emanated from PW-1 and PW-2. An accused certainly has a right to

remain to silent, and the presumption of innocence will always be in his

favour. If the appellant exercised such right and remained silent, no

adverse comment is warranted in law. However, when the appellant opts

to make a dock statement, he on his own volition abandons his right to

remain silent. Then he cannot claim the full benefit of such right to

remain silent.

32. When a dock statement is made the failure to explain the incriminating

circumstances makes such dock statement deficient (vide Jayasuriya J.,

in Ajit Samarakoon vs. The Republic (Kobaigane Murder Case) [(2004)

2 Sri LR 209]. Thus, the dock statement of the appellant, whilst being

inherently improbable and deficient, it is extremely probable that it is a

false position taken up at the end of the trial to save himself. A dock

statement, which is improbable, incomplete and apparently false cannot

create any reasonable doubt and should be rejected. The only reasonable

conclusion that a trier of fact could arrive on this evidence is nothing

but a total rejection of the dock statement. 33. The Trial Judge has considered and adverted his mind to the contents of

the dock statement. Thereafter, at page 35 of the judgement, the Trial

Judge has once again, evaluating the totality of the evidence, considered

the defence position as narrated in the dock statement. Then, concluded

that the prosecution had proved the charges beyond reasonable doubt.

The only inference is that the trial judge had rejected the dock statement

and concluded that no reasonable doubt was created by the said dock

statement. In the absence of a direct rejection and requiring

corroboration of the dock statement is a misdirection to that extent.

Thus, in view of the aforesaid this is a fit matter to act under the proviso

to Section 334 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

34. Section 334(1) reads as follows:

HCC-0155-20

Page 15 of 17

The Court of Appeal on any appeal against conviction on a verdict

of a jury shall allow the appeal if it thinks that such verdict should

be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be

supported having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of

the Court before which the Appellant was convicted should be set

aside on the ground of a wrong decision of any question of any law

or that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice, and in

any other case shall dismiss the appeal;

Provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion

that the point raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of

the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial

miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. (Emphasis added).

This provision decrees that the court must allow the appeal if there was

a miscarriage of justice but it also provides that the court may dismiss

the appeal if actually there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice.

How do we reconcile this? As I see the proviso inter alia enables and

requires an appellate court to evaluate the trial error, non-direction or

the mis-direction in light of the totality of the evidence to determine if a

conviction should be set aside and quashed. To this end the Appellate

court will have regard to the nature of the error, the strength of the

properly admitted evidence and the totality of the circumstances in

assessing and determining if the verdict should be set aside and reversed.

The ground raised by the appellant when considered in isolation may

have merit and be decided in favour of the appellant, and there may be

a miscarriage of justice when so considered. However, if there be

overwhelming evidence that would inevitably have led a judge or jury

properly directed to a conclusion of guilt then no substantial miscarriage

of justice can actually occur and such appeal may be thus dismissed.

35. In this regard, H. S. Yapa, J., in Moses vs. State [(1999) 3 SLR 401]

held that:

HCC-0155-20

Page 16 of 17

Though Section 334(1) refers to cases of trial by jury, it is

reasonable and proper to assume that the intention of the

legislation must necessarily be the same, whether it is a trial before

a Jury or Judge sitting alone. The deciding factor being that there

should be evidence upon which the accused might reasonably

have been convicted. (Emphasis added).

36. Then the proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution reads thus:

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the

provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate

jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in law which

shall be committed by any Court of First Instance, tribunal or other

institution and sole and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal,

revision and restitutio in integrum, of all causes , suits, actions,

prosecutions, matters and things of which such Court of First

Instance, tribunal or other institution may have taken cognizance:

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice. (Emphasis added).

37. In these circumstances, the failure of the Trial Judge to expressly reject

the dock statement and requiring corroboration has caused no

miscarriage of justice, and as afore stated a properly directed jury or

judge would necessarily have come to the same conclusion on this

evidence. Thus, no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually

occurred and has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the appellant

or occasioned a failure of justice.

38. In the above circumstances, the appeal is accordingly rejected. The

conviction and the sentence are affirmed.

HCC-0155-20

Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.
