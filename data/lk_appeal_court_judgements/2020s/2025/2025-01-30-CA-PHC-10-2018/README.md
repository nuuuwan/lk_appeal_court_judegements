JUDGMENT

M.C.B.S. Morais J.

This is an application made under Article 154 (p) (6) of the Constitution of the Democratic

Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read with section 2 (1)(b) of the High Court of the Provinces

(special provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990.

The Applicant-Petitioner-Appellant, Francis Don Turin Perera (hereinafter sometimes will be

referred to as the Appellant) has appealed the order dated 16th of January 2018 of the Civil

Appellate High Court of Gampaha, in the case No. HC/Rev 19/16 against the 1st and 2nd

Respondents (hereinafter sometimes will be referred to as the Respondent), seeking

restoration of possession to the land in dispute, under the provisions of section 66 of the

Primary courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, on the basis that the Appellant was forcibly

dispossessed by the 1st and 2nd Respondents, within a period of two months immediately

Page 4 of 7

before the filing of the application. Accordingly, the Appellant has prayed for the following

reliefs.

I. To set aside the order of the High Court dated 16/01/2018.

II. Order the possession of the corpus be granted to the Appellant.

The Appellant had made an application to the Magistrate Court of Wattala, under and in

terms of section 66 (1) (b) of the Primary Courts Act no 44 of 1979 on 22nd of November

2015. The Appellant contends that he has been in possession of the corpus until he was

forcibly dispossessed from the land.

The Appellant contends that from 2013 onwards the 1st Respondent along with the 2nd

Respondent had tried to enter the said corpus forcefully. Accordingly, the Appellant had

made a series of complaints to the Wattala police regarding the matter from 2013 to 2015.

However, no actions were taken by the Police regarding the matter. On 28th of May 2015, the

1st and 2nd Respondents forcefully entered the land ejecting the Appellant and his agents by

locking the gate. The Appellant has restrained from regaining the possession of the land

considering the likelihood of breach of peace. Since the police authority has failed to act upon

the complaint given by the Appellant under section 66(1)(a) of the primary court's Procedure

Act No. 44 of 1979, the Appellant had filed an application under section 66(1)(b) of the

primary court's Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, in the Magistrate Court of Wattala.

The learned Magistrate of Wattala in her order dated 9th of March 2016 has found that the

Appellant has failed to establish the threshold of jurisdiction as to breach of the peace is

threatened or likely under section 66 (1)(b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

It should be noted that , the learned Magistrate of Wattala in the previous proceedings dated

30th of November 2015, has considered this issue and come to a finding that there is a

likelihood of breach of peace and accordingly had decided to issue notice to the Respondents.

However, in the order dated 9th of March 2016, the learned Magistrate of Wattala has decided

to the contrary that there is no likelihood of breach of peace, and the application has been

dismissed. Therefore, the Appellant contends that the learned Magistrate of Wattala has erred

Page 5 of 7

in law by considering the threshold for the jurisdiction under section 66(1)(b) of the Act has

not been met.

Aggrieved by the order dated 9th of March 2019, the Appellant has made a revision

application in the High Court of Gampaha. The learned High Court Judge of Gampaha has

upheld the order of the learned Magistrate of Wattala and thereby has dismissed the revision

application by the order dated 16th of January 2018. In the said order, the learned High Court

Judge of Gampaha has relied on the reasoning of the learned Magistrate of Wattala in the

order dated 9th of March 2016. In addition, the learned High Court Judge have relied on the

inaction of the Wattala police in support of the learned Magistrates finding, that there is no

breach of peace or any likelihood of such to invoke section 66(1)(a) of the Act.

Section 66(1) of the primary court's Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, reads as follows,

66.

(1) Whenever owing to a dispute affecting land a breach of the peace is threatened or

likely-

(a) the police officer inquiring into the dispute- (i) shall with the least possible delay

file information regarding the dispute in the Primary Court within whose jurisdiction

the land is situated and require each of the parties to the dispute to enter into a bond

for his appearance before the Primary Court on the day immediately succeeding the

date of filing the information on which sittings of such court are held; or (ii) shall, if

necessary in the interests of preserving the peace, arrest the parties to the dispute and

produce them forthwith before the Primary Court within whose jurisdiction the land is

situated to be dealt with according to law and shall also at the same time file in that

court the information regarding the dispute; or

(b) any party to such dispute may file an information by affidavit in such Primary

Court setting out the facts and the relief sought and specifying as respondents the

names and addresses of the other parties to the dispute and then such court shall by

its usual process or by registered post notice the parties named to appear in court on

Page 6 of 7

the day specified in the notice-such day being not later than two weeks from the day

on which the information was filed.

According to section 66(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, the first information

regarding the breach of peace or likelihood of breach of peace can be filed either by the

police officer inquiring into the dispute under section 66(1)(a) or by any party to such dispute

under section 66(1)(b). Therefore, the Appellant was on an equal footing with the police

officer in law to file an application under section 66.

Further, in the case of Gamaralalage Jayasinghe and Others V. Mahara Mudiyanselage

Loku Bandara, [2019] 2 Sri LR 202, Samayawardhena J. held that;

Then, under section 66(2), it has been enacted that when the first information is filed

under section 66(1), irrespective of whether it is filed by the police or a party to the

dispute, the Magistrate is automatically vested with jurisdiction to inquire into and

determine the matter, without further ado.

Under section 66(1), the formation of opinion as to whether a breach of the peace is

threatened or likely is left to the police officer inquiring into the dispute or to any

party to the dispute. Both are on equal footing. Who files the information is beside the

point.

Therefore, it is clear that the learned Magistrate has the authority to inquire into the matter

when an application is made under section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act,

irrespective of whether it is filed by a police officer or a private party. Furthermore, the above

judgment overrules the judgment by his Lordship Ismail J. in Velupillai V. Sivanathan

[1993]1 SLR 123, and holds that it does not correctly represent the law in this regard. The

question of breach of the peace is threatened or likely is dependent on the police officer

who inquires about the matter or the party to the dispute who files the application. Therefore,

the learned High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate of Wattala has come to the decision

on an incorrect basis, by deciding that the court has no jurisdiction to delve into the matter as

the Appellant has failed to establish jurisdiction.

For the aforesaid reasons, I reverse the order of the learned High Court judge dated 16th of

January 2018, allowing the appeal and setting aside the order of the learned Magistrate dated

9th of March 2016. Accordingly I direct the learned Magistrate of Wattala to look into the

merits of this matter and adjudicate upon it.

This appeal is allowed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

R. Gurusinghe J.

I agree
