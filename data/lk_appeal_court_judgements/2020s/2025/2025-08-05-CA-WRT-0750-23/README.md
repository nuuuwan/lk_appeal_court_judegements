JUDGEMENT

K. M. G. H. KULATUNGA, J.

1. At the outset, the Counsel for the petitioners informed that he is not

pursuing with the relief prayed for by prayers (d) and (f). This writ

application seeks to quash certain portions of the determination dated

29.08.2023 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (hereinafter referred

to as the AAT) (P-36) by way of writ of certiorari. The petitioners are

also seeking writs of mandamus to compel the Public Service

Commission (PSC) to hold an inquiry which is alleged to have been

denied by P-24 and P-25.

Facts.

2. The petitioners are Excise Officers attached to the Excise Department.

In 2011, a structured interview was held and the written examination

was held in 2012 to fill 22 vacant positions. Up to 50% of the positions

were for those with over 10 years experience and the balance for the

others to which category the petitioners had fallen. The said

examination was conducted both in Sinhala as well as Tamil languages.

Due to an error committed by the Examinations Department, the

Sinhala medium paper required the answering of 4 out of 7 questions,

whereas in the Tamil medium paper, the requirement was 5 of 7

questions to be answered. Originally, around twelve persons have

complained against this examination to the PSC. However, six of them

appear to have been successful at this examination. The petitioners

have not obtained the necessary pass mark of 40% for each subject and

have been unsuccessful. As such, the two petitioners along with few

others have made several appeals/applications to the PSC to complain

of the said irregularity in the said examination paper. However, as they

were not successful, an appeal has been preferred to the AAT. The

allegation against the PSC is that an opportunity was not afforded to

the petitioners and certain decisions to grant appointments based on

the said examination results. The AAT upon considering the appeal

WRT/0750/23

Page 9 of 12

pronounced its order on 29.08.2023 (P-36) whereby the PSC was

directed to hold a fresh examination only to those unsuccessful

candidates who sat the 2012 examination. This examination was

ordered in view of the alleged defects and irregularities of the

examination. The relevant portion of the said Order of the AAT reads

thus;

As such, this Tribunal orders that the relief prayed for by the

appellants would not be granted, but orders the PSC and all those

Authorities concerned to hold another examination and give an

opportunity to the appellants and all others who were not

successful at the written examination and the structured interview

described above in this order to sit for a fresh written examination.

Those who obtained cut-off marks or above should be called for a

structured interview following the same guidelines laid down in the

notification published in the Internal Circular dated 20.06.2012 of

the Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Planning, and those who

obtained cut-off marks of 156 and above should be appointed to

the post of Excise Superintendent on a supernumerary basis with

effect from 23.06.2020, until they are absorbed into the permanent

cadre on the occurrence of vacancies in the post.

It is admitted that the petitioners have sat the subsequent examination

held in April 2025.

3. I observed that the AAT, in coming to this conclusion, has been mindful

and expressly adverted to the alleged defects in the examination paper

and the irregularities and prejudice caused to the petitioners on the one

hand, and also the interest of the successful candidates. Upon

balancing the rights and interests of all parties that may be affected,

the AAT has afforded another opportunity to the petitioners to sit for an

exam afresh with the specific directive that the appointments of the

WRT/0750/23

Page 10 of 12

successful candidates will be with effect from 23.06.2020. The previous

successful candidates received their promotions on that day.

4. As at today, the petitioners are neither seeking to quash the

examination held in 2012, nor are they seeking a mandamus directing

their appointments or any other substantive relief. According to the

learned Counsel for the petitioners, as the petitioners have been denied

a fair hearing and an opportunity to participate at an inquiry before the

PSC, they desire to pursue with this remedy to establish the denial of

their said right. In short, what the petitioners are now seeking is a mere

declaration, if at all, and no more. Substantive relief for their alleged

grievance has been already addressed and granted by the AAT by its

Order dated 29.08.2023. The petitioners have now sat and participated

in the subsequent examination exclusively held for them. The learned

Counsel for the petitioner submitted that what the petitioners desire is

setting aside of certain portions of P-36 and conceded that there is no

substantive relief that they are seeking by way of a writ. Unfortunately,

the jurisdiction of this Court is to issue writs and not declarations. In

these circumstances, in the absence of any substantive and effective

relief sought or that could be granted, this application is now academic

and futile to that extent.

Futility.

5. The petitioners have been afforded the opportunity of sitting for a fresh

examination. It is also specifically ordered that if any one of the

petitioners was successful at the said examination, their appointments

be with effect from 23.06.2020 on a supernumerary basis until they are

absorbed into the permanent cadre. Accordingly, the petitioners will not

be in a lesser position to those who were successful and appointed upon

the first examination. To my mind, the Order P-36 by itself, has

provided everything the petitioners required to rectify the alleged

prejudice that may have been caused by the defective examination.

WRT/0750/23

Page 11 of 12

There is, in fact, no prejudice to the petitioners that has been caused

by the said Order P-36.

6. In the case of Samastha Lanka Nidahas Grama Niladhari

Sangamaya vs. Dissanayake [2013] BLR 68, it was held as follows:

It is trite law that no court will issue a mandate in the nature of

writ of certiorari or mandamus where to do so would be vexatious

or futile.

Marsoof, PC., J., in the case of Ratnasiri and others vs. Ellawala

(2004) SLR 180, and others held as follows:

This court is mindful of the fact that the prerogative remedies it is

empowered to grant in these proceedings are not available as of

right. The court has a discretion in regard to the grant of relief in

the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction. It has been held time

and time again by our Courts that A writ... will not issue where it

would be vexatious or futile. See, P.S. Bus Co. Ltd. v Members

and Secretary of the Ceylon Transport Board. (61 NLR 491,

496).

In Siddeek v. Jacolyn Senevirathna and three others (1984) 1 SLR

83, the Supreme Court observed as follows:

Certiorari being a discretionary remedy will be withheld if the

nature of the error does not justify judicial intervention. Certiorari

will not issue where the end result will be futility, frustration,

injustice and illegality.

7. In the above circumstances, it is with regret I note that the petitioners

appear to have embarked upon instituting this application for an

ulterior purpose, so to say. The subsequent conduct of the petitioners

in sitting for the examination held as directed by the AAT clearly

establishes that they had no real or lawful reason to complain against

the said Order. It is admitted that the petitioners did sit for the

WRT/0750/23

Page 12 of 12

examination in April 2025. It appears that continuing with this

application does not appear to be bona fide as there is no effective or

substantial relief that could have been obtained by this Court.

Therefore, these proceedings are rendered futile and academic. The

petitioners appear to have appreciated this, and has not sought any

substantive relief, except the quashing of certain portions of the order

P-36. Accordingly, there is no basis in law that entitles the petitioner to

have and maintain this application or to obtain the relief as prayed for.

8. Accordingly, this application is dismissed, subject to costs. As for costs,

what is relevant is that the petitioners, having obtained relief from the

AAT, have merely instituted and pursued with this application knowing

very well that it is futile. In these circumstances, it is apparent that this

was merely pursued with to cause hardship to the respondents. The

petitioners have, to an extent, abused the process of this Court which

has resulted in wasting much valuable judicial time. In these

circumstances, I made the following order for the payment of costs.

Each of the petitioners is directed to pay to the 19th - 23rd, 26th, and

28th respondents costs in a sum of Rs. 10,000/- to each respondent

(the total cost payable by each petitioner separately is Rs. 70,000/-).

9. Application is dismissed.
