RESPONDENTS

BEFORE : K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J

COUNSEL : Srilal Lankathilaka for the Petitioner.

Panchali Witharana, SC for the Respondents.

ARGUED ON : 27.06.2025

DECIDED ON : 30.07.2025

JUDGEMENT

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J

1. The petitioner is seeking inter alia a writ of certiorari to quash the

application made under Section 42 (2) of the Land Acquisition Act

(hereinafter referred to as the Act) and also a writ of mandamus

directing the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd respondents to exercise their powers in

accordance with Sections 9, 10, and 17 of the Act in order to determine

and award compensation taking into consideration the cost and

WRT/0391/21

Page 4 of 10

expense of relocation of the fuel tanks before taking possession of the

said land.

2. The petitioner is not challenging the acquisition, and the learned Senior

Counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Srilal Lankathilaka, informed that he

would only pursue with the relief as far as the computation of the

compensation. When this Court issued notice by order dated

22.07.2022, His Lordship Justice Sobhitha Rajakaruna has issued

notice on the respondents only in reference to prayer (d) of the petition.

I also observe that the interim relief initially issued has also been

vacated on that day. Accordingly, the only matter to be considered in

this application is the computation of the compensation under Sections

9, 10, and 17.

3. When this was taken up for argument on 27.06.2025, the learned State

Counsel informed this Court that the Section 17 award had been

published on 23.06.2025 and tendered to Court a copy of the same.

Then, as permitted by Court, a certified copy of said Section 17

determination was tendered by motion dated 14.07.2025 along with the

supporting affidavit. It was the submission of learned State Counsel

that in view of the said Section 17 award. This application is now futile

and academic.

4. Since the issue of futility may determine this application, it is prudent

to consider the same at the outset. A court exercising discretionary

jurisdiction has the discretion to refuse relief where the Order sought

is likely to be futile. This is so when the Order sought is likely to lack

practical effect, have no real consequences or cannot be enforced.

Courts may refuse to make such Orders. The rationale, as I see, is

judicial economy so to say and doing so may have the propensity of

undermining the respect for the legal system and the administration of

justice. Thus, when a court is called upon to exercise the discretionary

WRT/0391/21

Page 5 of 10

writ jurisdiction, it will deny and refuse such an application which

evidently has no practical utility and is futile.

5. This principle is settled law, and in the case of Samastha Lanka

Nidahas Grama Niladhari Sangamaya vs. Dissanayake (2013) BLR

68, it was held that,

It is trite law that no court will issue a mandate in the nature of

writ of certiorari or mandamus where to do so would be vexatious

or futile.

Then Marsoof PC., J., in the case of Ratnasiri and others vs.

Ellawala (2004) SLR 180, and others held that;

This court is mindful of the fact that the prerogative remedies it is

empowered to grant in these proceedings are not available as of

right. The court has a discretion in regard to the grant of relief in

the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction. It has been held time

and time again by our Courts that A writ... will not issue where it

would be vexatious or futile. See, P.S. Bus Co. Ltd. v Members

and Secretary of the Ceylon Transport Board. (61 NLR 491,

496).

6. The petitioner does not dispute the fact that the Section 17

determination had been made. According to the copy tendered to Court,

the said inquiry and determination had been in respect of the claim of

Rs. 3,513,000.00. This is the initial claim made by the petitioner. Upon

considering this claim the 1st respondent had determined to award the

sum of Rs. 281,590.00 as compensation.

7. The argument of the petitioner is that the application will remain alive

and not became futile as the 1st respondent has not followed the

mandatory provisions of Sections 9 (1) (a), (b), (c), and (d) as well as

Section 17 (1) (a), (b), (c) of the Act. Further, as asserted in Paragraphs

15, 16, and 17 of the post argument written submissions, the amount

WRT/0391/21

Page 6 of 10

of the compensation determined is so unrealistic and its a violation of

the petitioners legitimate expectation. It is then submitted that the

award dated 23.06.2025 is not sufficient to absolute [sic. absolve] the

statutory duties bestowed upon the 1st respondent towards the

petitioner.

8. The sum total of the present application is the prayer for an Order

directing the respondents to exercise their power under Sections 9, 10,

and 17 and to declare and determine the award of compensation. It is

also sought that the respondents to be directed to take in to

consideration the valuation reports and the additional cost of relocation

of the fuel station. That is no more than an application for a mandamus

directing the respondents to make the award under Section 17 of the

Act. The same has now been made on 23.06.2025. So, for all purposes,

the relief sought has now been obtained. No doubt, this application was

filed on 17.08.2021. At that point of time the Section 17 award had not

been made upon considering the claim of compensation, considering

the relocation cost based on the valuation and estimation. Now that has

been satisfied and is done. Since, the interim order was vacated and

no specific interim relief was granted, the respondents were barred or

prevented by proceeding with Section 7 and 9 inquiry and making

another award under Section 17 of the Act. Therefore, to that extent,

the application is now futile.

9. The petitioner in their submission now calls upon this Court to consider

the adequacy and correctness of the amount of compensation awarded

by the said Section 17 award. In the first place, this Court cannot and

does not have the jurisdiction to embark upon the re-evaluation of the

compensation or reviewing of the compensation at this stage. It is

settled law that a Court is required to determine the issues which were

in issue at the point of instituting action. In any event, the petitioner

has the right of appeal under Section 16(2) of the said Act which he may

prefer within 21 days. In these circumstances, this Court is left with no

WRT/0391/21

Page 7 of 10

option but to accept the objection raised by the learned State Counsel.

Section 17 reads as follows:

17. 1. The acquiring officer who holds an inquiry under section 9

shall, as soon as may be after his decisions under section 10 have

become final as provided in that section or after the final

determination of any reference made under that section and

subject to the other provisions of this section, make an award

under his hand determining -

(a) the persons who are entitled to compensation in respect

of the land or servitude which is to be acquired;

(b) the nature of the interests of those persons in the land

which is to be acquired or over which the servitude is to be

acquired;

(c) the total amount of the claims for compensation for the

acquisition of the land or servitude;

(d) the amount of the compensation which in his opinion

should, in accordance with the provisions of Part VI of this

Act, be allowed for such acquisition; and

(e) the apportionment of the compensation among those

persons. Such acquiring officer shall give written notice of

the award to the persons who are entitled to compensation

according to the award.

(2) Where no person having any right, title or interest to, in or over

the whole or any part of a land which is to be acquired or over

which a servitude is to be acquired is known, then, in regard to the

whole of the land or in regard to that part only, as the case may

be, it shall not be necessary to determine in the award under this

section the matters specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (e) of

subsection (1) and to comply with the provisions of that subsection

relating to notice of the award.

WRT/0391/21

Page 8 of 10

(3) Where a claimant for compensation has notified his claim to the

acquiring officer within the time allowed therefor by this Act, the

amount of compensation awarded to that claimant under

subsection (1) shall not exceed the amount of his claim.

(4) An award under subsection (1) shall, where a reference under

section 10 has been made to a District Court or a Primary Court in

respect of the land or servitude to which the award relates, accord

with the decision of that court on that reference or, where an

appeal against that decision has been made to the Court of Appeal

with the decision of the Court of Appeal on that appeal.

10. According to which, upon the making of an award under Section 17,

the acquiring officer is required to give a written notice of such award to

persons who are entitled to compensation. The petitioners only and

substantive relief sought a mandamus directing the acquiring officer or

1st to 3rd respondents to exercise their powers in accordance with

Sections 9, 10, and 17 of the Act. The award and the notice under

Section 17 has been made and issued. This was tendered to Court by

way of a motion, along with an affidavit, and is now common ground.

There is nothing more this Court is now required to do. The relief as

prayed for by prayed (d) is thereby satisfied. However, the learned

Counsel Mr. Srilal Lankathilaka endeavoured to impress this Court that

this application will not be futile and move that the Court consider the

reasonableness, adequacy, and the correctness of the computation of

compensation. His position is that the Section 17 award was made long

after the filing of this application and thus cannot now stultify this

application, which was pending. At paragraph 27 of the written

submissions, it is submitted that Still the relief sought by the petitioner

remains effective and the mandamus cannot be refused on futility. The

learned Counsel is inviting this Court to look into the merits, correctness

and the adequacy of the award made under Section 17 on 23.06.2025.

WRT/0391/21

11. The petitioner comes to this Court seeking to compel the respondents

to act under Section 9, 10, and 17 of the Act. That is the parameter of

his application here. That step is now taken and computation of the

compensation is now made. The relief sought does not extend to

anything beyond taking steps under Section 9, 10, and 17. The

petitioner is now seeking to consider the merits of the award made under

Section 17. As stated above, the relief sought does not encompass or

cannot be extended to go beyond the cause of action which the petitioner

had as at the date of filing this application. The basis of this legal

impediment is referrable to the principle in civil matters as determined

in Jayaratna vs. Jayaratne and others [2002] 3 Sri LR 331, where

it was held by Gamini Amaratunga, J., that,

The cause of action based on adultery has arisen after the

defendant has filed his answer. It is a different and independent

cause of action. Rights of parties are determined as at the date of

plaint.

Similarly, in Hatton National Bank vs. Silva and another [1999] 3

Sri LR 113, it was held by De Silva, J., that,

The plaintiff cannot amend the plaint to include a new cause of

action which arose after the institution of the action.

Accordingly, the petitioner is not entitled in this application, to have the

merits of the award reviewed.

12. The petitioner, no doubt, came to Court as far back as 2021. The

process under Sections 9, 10, and 17 of the Act may have been pending.

His complaint was that the relocation cost and expense as per the

valuation and estimates should be considered in computation of the due

compensation. No interim relief was granted in this circumstances, the

process has continued and now it has culminated in determining and

making the award under Section 17 and due notice has been given.

According to the additional documents tendered, it is apparent that a

WRT/0391/21

Page 10 of 10

claim of Rs. 1.553 million and Rs. 16.183 million have been considered

and determined to award Rs. 2560 as compensation for land Rs.

434,375 for the other claim which appears to be the cost of relocation.

Be that as it may, the award now is made. The relief sought is so

satisfied. This Court cannot now venture into consideration of the

reasonableness of this award as this decision was not in existence at the

point of filing this application. The petitioner has a right of appeal

specifically provided and been informed of against such award.

Accordingly, this Court cannot lawfully embark upon the consideration

of the merits of the award, as argued by the learned Counsel for the

petitioner. As I see, this application is futile as futile can be. Accordingly,

the said submission is misconceived in law.

13. As such this Court does not have to embark upon the consideration of

the other matters agitated by the petitioner in this application.

Accordingly, I hold that this application is now futile and the petitioner

is not entitled to have and maintain this application.

14. This application is accordingly dismissed. However, I make no order as

to costs.
