The following facts are relevant to the Application.

On 6 April 2025, a motor traffic accident occurred on the ColomboKurunegala

Road involving vehicles bearing registration numbers NW-KK 2367 and NW-CAD

9534. The latter was driven by the suspect, Edirisinghe Mudiyanselage Pradeep

Lanka Edirisinghe. The driver of vehicle NW-KK 2367 sustained injuries and was

admitted to the hospital. According to the Medico-Legal Report (MLR), the suspect

was found to be under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, and MDMA at the time

of the incident. He was subsequently produced before the Learned Magistrate of

Kurunegala on a charge of causing grievous hurt and was released on bail

pursuant to Section 14 of the Bail Act No. 30 of 1997.

As stated in the Petition, on 8 April 2025, the Learned Magistrate revoked the

previously granted bail and issued a warrant for the suspects arrest, based on a

complaint by the aggrieved party alleging that the suspect was attempting to

tamper with evidence. Following his discharge from the hospital on 10 April 2025,

the suspect was produced before the Learned Magistrate and remanded in

custody. On 20 April 2025, the injured driver succumbed to his injuries, prompting

the police to file a report indicating an offence under Section 298 of the Penal Code,

along with Sections 148(1), 149(a), 151(3), 151(1)(b), and 126(4) of the Motor

Traffic Act. Subsequently, on 24 April 2025, a further report was submitted by the

police asserting that the offence committed by the suspect falls within the ambit

of Section 296 of the Penal Code. On 5 May 2025, the police informed the Learned

Magistrate that they had retrieved CCTV footage relevant to the investigation and

moved to submit the same to the Government Analyst for examination.

On 8 May 2025, a fresh bail application was submitted, asserting that there was

no substantive evidence to support a charge of murder and seeking the release of

the suspect on bail. The Learned Magistrate refused the application, remanded

the accused. Against the said order, this application was filed.

Page 5 of 13

When the matter was supported on 27 June 2025, Counsel for the Petitioner

informed the Court that an application for bail had been filed before the High

Court. Upon consideration of the submissions, notice was issued to the respondent.

On 24 July 2025, when the case was called, State Counsel objected to the revision

application on the ground that the Learned Magistrate lacked jurisdiction to grant

bail where the suspect was charged under Section 296 of the Penal Code. It was

further contended that this Court does not possess original jurisdiction to

entertain bail applications in relation to Section 296.

It is noteworthy that the Learned Magistrate had initially granted bail to the

suspect. However, on 8 May 2025, the said bail was revoked without assigning any

reasons, in deviation from the procedural safeguards set out under the Bail Act.

With regard to the cancellation of bail, the relevant section of the Bail Act is

section 14.

Section 14 of the Bail Act No 30 of 1997

14. (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding provisions of

this Act, whenever a person suspected or accused of being concerned in committing

or having committed a bailable or non-bailable offence, appears, is brought before

or surrenders to the court having jurisdiction, the court may refuse to release such

person on bail or upon application being made in that behalf by a police officer,

and after issuing notice on the person concerned and hearing him personally or

through his attorney-at -law, cancel a subsisting order releasing such person on

bail if the court has reason to believer.

Section (a). That such person would

(i) not appear to stand his inquiry or trial;

(ii) Interfere with the witnesses or the evidence against him or otherwise

obstruct the cause of justice; or

Page 6 of 13

(iii) Commit an offence while on bail; or that the particular gravity of, and

public reaction to, the alleged offence may give rise to public disquiet.

(emphasis added)

In the present matter, it is noteworthy that the police did not file an application

seeking the cancellation of the bail order previously granted.

The following judicial decisions pertain to the legal framework and principles

governing the cancellation of bail.

Anuruddha Ratwatte and Others v. The Attorney- General, 2003 (2) SLR 39 at

page 49, S.N. Silva CJ held that;

In this case the accused-appellants appeared before the High Court on

notice being issued for the service of indictments. Except for the 12th

accused the others had been released on bail. The High Court enhanced

the bail that had been ordered and those accused appellants continued to

be on bail. On 21.01.2003 when the High Court committed the accused

appellants to remand custody the court in effect cancelled the previous

order for enhanced bail made by the court itself on 15.11.2002. However

it is seen that the order placing the accused in remand custody, which is

contained in a single line does not even state that the previous order

330 made by that very court is cancelled. I have to note that the

order placing the accused-appellants in remand custody has been per-

functorily made without there being any application, without a hearing,

without grounds being adduced and without any reasons stated in

writing.

In terms of the mandatory requirements of Section 14(1) such a

cancellation could have been done only on :-

(i) an application being made by a police officer;

(ii) hearing the accused appellant personally or through his

attorney-at-law:

Page 7 of 13

(iii) if the court had reasons to believe that any one of the grounds

as specified in paragraph (a) (i) to (iii) or paragraph (b) have been made

out.

The accused appellants have been committed to remand custody without there

being any compliance with any of the requirements set out above.

In Rupathunga v. Attorney General ad another, 2009 (1) SLR 170 at 172, Ranjith

Silva, J held that;

Section 15 of the Bail Act states that where a Court refuses to release on bail any

person suspected or accused of, or being concerned in committing or having

committed any offence or cancels a subsisting order releasing a person on bail or

rescinds or varies an order cancelling a subsisting order it shall state, in writing

the reasons for such refusal, cancellation or rescission or variation as the case may

be. Therefore, it is the bounden duty of a High Court Judge to state reasons when

she is cancelling an already existing bail order. The reasons are set out in Section

14 and it is for those reasons that an already existing bail order could be cancelled.

On a perusal of this impugned order we find that she had not given any reason as

enumerated in Section 14. Apart from what has already been stated what shocks

the conscience of this Court is that this particular learned High Court Judge had

not even cared to provide an opportunity to the accused, at least to show cause as

to why bail should not be cancelled instead has considered some extraneous

matters which are not even covered by Section 14 and has rushed to the conclusion

that bail should be cancelled which I should say is indecent. Although it is

pertinent to note that the same learned High Court Judge on a subsequent date

namely on 11.07.2008 when an application was made to reconsider the

cancellation of bail, has made an order wherein she has stated that when she

ordered a cancellation of bail she acted under Section 14 (1)(a)(3) of the Bail Act

whereas she had not even mentioned that particular Section in her impugned

order dated 24.09.2007. Having completely failed to refer, even in passing, to

Section 14 of the Bail Act or any provision of the Bail Act, on 11.07.2008, she has

Page 8 of 13

stated in her order that she considered the application for bail under Section 14(1)

of the Bail Act. It is pathetic to note that the learned High Court Judge has not

even been mindful of Sections 14 and 15 of the Bail Act when she made the

impugned order. These are orders which could be branded as capricious, arbitrary

and unjust. Therefore, we set aside the said impugned order and the learned High

Court Judge is directed to forthwith release the accused from remand custody.

The above said judgments were considered by Justice Sampath B. Abeykoon in

CPA/132/2023 decided on 31.01.2024 held that;

I find that the reasons given by the learned High Court Judge to cancel bail of the

accused does not fall within the ambit of section 14 of the Bail Act to justify

cancellation of bail. I am of the view that any cancellation of bail given to an

accused shall be under limited circumstances as provided for in section 14 of the

Bail Act, whatever the section 263 of the Code of Criminal This said section was

considered in the following judgments

In the present case, the Learned Magistrate failed to afford the suspect an

opportunity to show cause as to why the bail previously granted should not be

cancelled. Furthermore, the Magistrate did not assign any reasons for the

cancellation of bail.

It is my considered view that the Learned Magistrates order lacks justification

and does not comply with the requirements set out under the Bail Act No. 30 of

1997. Specifically, Section 14 of the Act prescribes the procedure to be followed for

the cancellation of an existing bail order, which was not duly adhered to in this

instance.

It is recognized that the present matter is a revision application. Where the

impugned order is such that it shocks the conscience of the court, the court is

vested with the jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by the petitioner.

In Wijesinghe V. Tharmaratnam CA 120/80, Decided on 14th October 1986, page

47 at page 49 Srikanthas Law Reports, Volume (IV) Jameel J. held that,

Page 9 of 13

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the application

discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of court.

This was further established in Bank of Ceylon Vs Kaleel and others [2004] 1 SLR

284, Per Wimalachandra J,

In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must have

occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which go beyond an

error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would instantly react to it;

the order complained of is of such a nature which would have shocked the

conscience of court.

Accordingly, we conclude that the order issued by the Learned Magistrate in

respect of the cancellation of bail was rendered without due regard to the relevant

provisions of the Bail Act. As such, the said order is unlawful and constitutes a

clear violation of the established legal framework governing bail proceedings.

The pertinent question, however, is whether the Learned Magistrate, upon being

presented with the facts, gave due consideration to whether the alleged offence

falls within the ambit of Section 296.

In Dayananda v. Weerasinghe and Others, (1983) 2 SLR 84 at page 91, his

Lordship Ratwatte, J held that:

Magistrate should be more vigilant and comply with the requirement of the law

when making remand orders and not act as mere rubber stamps.

In Udaya Prabhath Gammanpila v. M.D.C.P. Gunathilake and Others, S.C.F.R.

Application No. 207/2016, decided on 11.07.2016, his Lordship K. Sripavan, C.J.

held that;

The Court emphasizes that when a B Report is filed, the Magistrate has to

apply his judicial mind to the said Report and give appropriate directions to the

Page 10 of 13

Police if further investigations are necessary. The Magistrate shall not make

orders mechanically without applying his judicial mind.

In the instant case, the police filed the further report on 20th April 2025, following

the death of the driver, wherein the alleged offence was categorized under Section

298 of the Penal Code, together with Sections 148(1), 149(a), 151(3)(b), and 126(4)

of the Motor Traffic Act.

Subsequently, on 24th April 2025, the police filed a further report indicating that

the offence committed by the suspect falls within the scope of Section 296 of the

Penal Code.

We are mindful that in forming the opinion that the alleged offence falls under

Section 296, the Learned Magistrate failed to take into account the third limb of

Section 294 of the Penal Code, which provides as follows:

Section 294 of the Penal Code

294. Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder

Fourthly, If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently

dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is

likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the

risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.

According to the facts submitted through the further report, the police have stated

that the motor accident occurred while the suspect was overtaking a bus on the

highway. There had also not been any evidence to establish that the suspect knew

that the vehicle in which the deceased was travelling was coming from the

opposite direction. Such circumstances perse, set up a situation of negligent

conduct of the suspect. It is perplexing that the Learned Magistrate failed to

take into account the following statutory provision when the road accident was

formally reported.

Page 11 of 13

261B. Any person who is guilty of the offence of contravening the provisions of

subsection (1B) of section 151 shall, on conviction after summary trial before a

Magistrate, be liable-

a. Where he causes death to any person, to imprisonment of either description for

a term not less than two and not exceeding ten years and to the cancellation of

his driving licence;

b. Where he causes injury to any person, to a fine not less than five

thousandrupees or to imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding

five years or to both such fine and imprisonment and to the cancellation of his

driving licence.

I am mindful of the words uttered by his Lordship Yasantha Kodagodage PC in

Mohamed Razik Mohamed Ramzy v. B.M.A. S.K. Senaratne and Others, SC/FR

Application No.135/2020, Decided on 14.11.2023, held that;

That being material based upon which the Magistrate having to determine

whether or not the suspect being produced by the officer-in-charge of the police

station should be placed in remand custody and/or enlarged on bail. Section 115(2)

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act provides that The Magistrate before whom

a suspect is forwarded under this section, if he is satisfied that it is expedient to

detain the suspect in custody pending further investigation, may after recording

his reasons, by warrant addressed to the superintendent of any prison authorise

the detention of the suspect

Itis well established in our jurisprudence that an accused person is presumed to

be innocent until proven guilty. Section 115(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code

stipulates that where a suspect is produced before a Magistrate under Section

115(1), the Magistrate may order the detention of the suspect pending further

investigation provided he is satisfied that such detention is warranted and records

the reasons for his decision.

In this context, it is essential to examine the reasons recorded by the Learned

Magistrate when the order for remanding the suspect was made.

Materials) .

It is my considered view that the Learned Magistrate failed to properly assess

whether the offence allegedly committed by the suspect falls under the provisions

of the Motor Traffic Act or constitutes the offence of murder. Upon examination of

the circumstances, I am of the view that the incident is more appropriately

categorized under the Motor Traffic Act.

For the above-mentioned reasons, we set aside the order made on 28.05.2025 and

also quash the order made on 08.04.2025 by the learned magistrate. The Learned

Magistrate is directed to enlarge the suspect on the same terms imposed on him

by order dated 07.04.2025. We also direct the Learned Magistrate to send the

case record to the Hon. Attorney General to consider the material available for

further action.

We direct the prison authority to produce the suspect before the Learned

Magistrate without delay to enable the Learned Magistrate to act as directed by

the instant order of this court.
