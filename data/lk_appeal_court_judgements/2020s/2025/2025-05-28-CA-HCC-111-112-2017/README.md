JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused- Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) were indicted

before the High Court of Panadura on two charges of committing the offence of

Page 3 of 23

murder of one Saul Hameed Jahan and his wife Abdul Asees Ummul Safeera on

07.05.2006, punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code as amended.

The Prosecution led the evidence through eleven witnesses and marked

productions from P1 to P10 and thereafter closed its case. The Accused, in their

defence made dock statements. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High

Court Judge, by judgment dated 22.03.2017, found the Accused guilty of murder

and imposed the death sentence. Further, a fine of Rs. 10,000 was imposed for

each count.

Being aggrieved by the afore-mentioned conviction and the sentence, the Accused

persons have preferred this appeal to this Court.

The following are the grounds of appeal as pleaded by the Accused;

1. Whether the Learned High Court Judge properly evaluated the

contradictions and omissions marked by the prosecution in her judgments.

2. Whether the legal principles pertaining to the common intention were

properly evaluated in the judgment.

3. Whether the Learned High Court Judge had wrongly evaluated the

evidence in her judgment

4. Whether the Learned High Court Judge erred in law in evaluating the

circumstantial evidence of this case

5. Whether the Learned High Court Judge had properly evaluated the dock

statement made by the appellant.

During the argument stage, the main ground urged by the Counsel for the 1st

Accused was that from the evidence led before the Learned High Court Judge, she

Page 4 of 23

had failed to give the benefit to the Accused, the plea of provocation as contained

in exception 1 to Section 294 of the Penal Code which would convert the offence of

murder to the lesser offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The

Counsel for the 2nd Accused indicated that there is no evidence to prove that there

was a common intention to convict the 2nd Accused. The Senior Additional Solicitor

General appearing for the Prosecution agreed that based on the evidence placed

before the Court, the Trial Judge should have considered the mitigatory plea of

provocation, which she had failed to consider.

The facts of this case are briefly summarized as follows;

According to the evidence of PW4 Alahendra Acharige Mangalika Perera, who was

a tenant living in the Accuseds building, the Accused had rented four rooms to

three couples and a lady, in one of which the deceased couple lived.

According to her, on the day in question, around 9 PM, the deceased Jahan started

shouting at the Accused, stating that there was no electricity and therefore his

child could not sleep. The Accused has indicated that the electricity was cut down

due to nonpayment of the bill by the Muslim Couple who are deceased. According

to this witness, there was a heated argument between the deceased couple and the

Accused over this issue. Thereafter, the Accused and his wife came to their room

and went outside with an iron bar.

Then she heard the cries of the deceased namely Safeera, the wife saying

. Thereafter, she saw both the Accused come towards their door and go to

their house. Then she heard Jakirs wife asking for water, then the 2nd Accused

had gone towards her, saying that, .

Page 6 of 23

In the meantime, Deepika and her husband came to this witnesss room and stayed

there. Later, she saw the 1st Accused going alone with a manna knife. Again, she

heard the voice of the deceased saying .

Then she saw the 1st Accused bringing the child of the deceased and giving the

child to the 2nd Accused. She further stated that she heard the deceased insisting

that the child could not sleep because of not having electricity. Then there was a

quarrel between Jakir and the 1st Accused, and the latter had stated

. This had continued for some time.

According to her evidence, for some reason, the police had come for an inquiry with

regard to a complaint made by Deepika against the deceased. But the Prosecution

has not revealed the reason for the Police to come.

This witness stated the following facts at the inquest;

On page 224 of the brief;

: "

. .

. ... .

Also, there is evidence to show that Deepika and her husband came to the room

and stayed there in fear. It shows that some incident happened prior to this

incident between the deceased and the neighbours.

Further, she revealed that on the day in question in the early morning, Deepika

and the deceased had a fight, and the Accused was also involved in that. According

Page 7 of 23

to her, Deepika went to the Police Station with her to lodge a complaint against

the deceased Jakir. After she made the complaint, the Police came and inquired.

Further, she has revealed that there were always quarrels between the deceased

husband and wife and the deceased Jakir used to consume liquor and fight with

his wife.

On page 237 - 238 of the Brief;

The Counsel for the Accused suggested that the deceased had thrown stones at

Deepikas house.

According to PW3, Nihal Wasantha Kumara, who was considered as an adverse

witness by the Prosecution, had stated that he got to know that there was a fight

between the Muslim family and Deepikas family. Further, he stated that he heard

that the deceased was scolding Gamage for the disconnection of electricity.

According to PW5, Kalabandaralage Rupasinghe, he admitted that his wife

Deepika had complained against the deceased Jakir.

On page 267 of the brief;

Page 8 of 23

: ?

.

He affirmed that Deepika and PW4 had gone to the Police to complain against the

deceased. According to this witness, the Police had come around 9.30 PM for the

inquiry about the complaint made by Deepika. The Police had come and asked for

his wife, but she was not at home.

Then, the Police had inquired the deceased regarding the incident.

It has been established that the deceased couple had issues with others, creating

an unpleasant environment for others to live peacefully, which could have

provoked the landlord, the 1st Accused, who has rented out the whole house to

several people. According to the evidence, there is no cordial relationship between

the deceased and the neighbours.

On the night in question, due to the failure of not paying the money by the

deceased, electricity was disconnected. Because of that, all the tenants of the

Accuseds building were scolding the Accused for the non-availability of electricity.

Even the deceased who had failed to pay the bill scolded the Accused.

With the above inferences, it is pertinent to consider whether the killing of the

deceased falls under the plea of grave and sudden provocation, against the weight

of the evidence at the trial.

Page 9 of 23

Exception I to Section 294 of the Penal Code reads as follows:

Exception I.- Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender whilst

deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation,

causes the death of the person who gave the provocation, or causes the death

of any other person by mistake or accident.

The above exception is subject to the following provisos

Firstly- That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the

offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person.

Secondly-That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience

to the law, or by a public servant, in the lawful exercise of the powers of

such public servant.

Thirdly, that the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful

exercise of the right of private defence.

Explanation- Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to

prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.

The plea of grave and sudden provocation is discussed by Prof. G.L. Peiris in

Offences Under the Penal Code of Sri Lanka, (1998), 2nd edition at page 99,

(ii) The requirement that the provocation should be 'grave' is embodied in

the statutory statement of the exception. The Explanation contained in the

Penal Code declares that "Whether the provocation was grave enough to

prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact. In

Punchirala, Bertram C.J. said: "Although the term is a relative one,

Page 10 of 23

nevertheless the provocation must still be grave. It must have some element

of gravity. The merest idle word or gesture. . . is not sufficient. " However,

the proper construction of the word 'grave' has been the subject of acute

controversy in Ceylon.

Several different interpretations of "gravity" have been suggested in the

cases:

(a) Provocation is grave when a reasonable man would be prompted to

retaliate against it;

(b) Gravity of provocation requires that the provocation offered should be

such as to result in loss of self-control in the person provoked;

(c) The element of gravity of provocation is satisfied in circumstances where

the reasonable man would resent deeply the provocation offered;

(d) Provocation is grave only where the reasonable man is likely to lose his

self-control in consequence of the provocation.

Ratanlal Ranchhoddas & Dhirajlal Keshavlal Thakore, The Law of Crimes, 19th

Ed, pg. 729, Chapter XVI

Grave and sudden provocation.'-The provocation must be grave and sudden

and of such a nature as to deprive the accused of the power of self-control.

In determining whether the provocation was so, it is admissible to take into

account the condition of the mind in which the offender was at the time of

the provocation.13 But it is not a necessary consequence of anger, or other

emotion, that the power of self- control should be lost. It must be shown

Page 11 of 23

distinctly not only that the act was done under the influence of some feeling

which took away from the person doing it all control over his actions, but

that that feeling had an adequate cause. It has, therefore, been held in a

series of cases that the commission of adultery by a wife within the sight of

her husband is a sufficient grave provocation to bring the husband within

this exception if he kills her. In such cases very mild punishment is usually

inflicted.

Information received from a reliable person and believed to be credible as

to the existence of a provoking act, which is being done in the immediate

neighbourhood and the existence of which is instantaneously verified, can

be said to be provocation given by the person committing that act just as

much as if the person provoked had seen it in the first place with his own

eyes.

"It must not however be understood that any trivial provocation, which in

point of law amounts to an assault, or even a blow, will of course reduce the

crime of the party killing to manslaughter... For where the punishment

inflicted for a slight transgression of any sort is outrageous in its nature

either in the manner or the continuance of it, and beyond all proportion to

the offence, it is rather to be considered as the effect of a brutal and

diabolical malignity than Of human frailty: it is one of the true symptoms

of what the law denominates malice; and therefore the crime will amount

to murder, notwithstanding such provocation.

Page 12 of 23

When the derangement of the mind reaches such a degree that the

judgment and reason cases to hold dominion over it their authority being

suspended and yielding place to violent and ungovernable passion- the man

who was before a rational being is no longer the master of his own

understanding, becomes incapable of cool reflection, and ceases to have

control over his passions. It is to such a state of mind that the law in judging

of acts which cause death, gives indulgent consideration. And no mental

perturbation or agitation which falls short of this, and leaves sway to reason

and the power of self-control, can reduce a murder to an offence within the

range of this mitigating exception.

The provocation must be such as will upset not merely a hasty and hot-

tempered or hvpersensitive person, but one of ordinary sense and calmness.

The Court has to consider whether a reasonable person placed in the same

position as the accused would have behaved in the manner in which the

accused behaved on receiving the same provocation. If it appears that the

action of the accused was out of all proportion to the gravity or magnitude

of the provocation offered, the case will not fall under the exception. The

case can only fall under the exception when the court is able to hold that

provided the alleged provocation is given, every normal person would

behave or act in the same way as the accused in the circumstances in which

the accused was placed, acted. Where the deceased inquired twice from the

accused as to where the accused lived and on receiving no reply the deceased

said to the accused "Hai tu poora chamar" and thereupon the accused struck

the deceased in the neck with a hatchet with the result that the deceased

Page 13 of 23

died instantaneously, it was held that though the act was committed in a

fit of passion the intention of the accused was to kill the deceased and he

was therefore guilty of murder. The mere sight of a person going to Court

who had filed a criminal complaint should not give rise to grave and sudden

provocation in the mind of the accused and if he kills the complainant after

some altercation the offence will be murder.

Mr. Palitha Fernando, PC (Former Attorney-General) in his book Selected Essays

on Criminal Law of Sri Lanka, page 311 states that:

As stated previously, any provocation will not entitle the offender to the

protection of the mitigatory plea. It has to be a degree of provocation that

would result in a reasonable person loosing his self control. In deciding

whether the provocation measures up to that degree, court would have to

examine the provocatory words objectively. Even mere verbal abuse, if

sufficiently provocative, will attract the protection of the mitigatory plea.

However in considering whether the provocation given satisfies the

requirement necessary to bring it within the exception, court should

necessarily consider the education and social standing of the offender. Thus

the test used for the purpose is the test of a reasonable average man of the

same social back ground and education of the offender. Therefore, in my

view, the provocatory statement alleged to have been made should

necessarily be considered by court in arriving at the conclusion whether the

accused would be entitled to the mitigatory defence of provocation. It is

necessary that court considers whether the statement attributed to the

victim was sufficiently provocative to provide the accused of the mitigatory

Page 14 of 23

defence so that the offence of murder could be reduced to culpable homicide

not amounting to murder.

The issue as to whether the retaliatory action triggered off by the

provocation should be proportionate to the provocation given, in order to

attract the provisions of the exception has also been considered by our

courts. Our courts have approved the view that the retaliatory action and

the provocation should not be taken as two separate acts but as an integral

part of the whole process when deciding on the application of the exception

of grave and sudden provocation to any given case.

Our Courts have held that to determine a plea of provocation, the Courts have to

determine whether the Accused was deprived of his self-control, due to such

provocation and the provocation is grave.

What is provocation is considered by His Lordship Nagalingam S.P.J in K.D.J.

Perera v. The King, 53 NLR 193, at page 201, held that:

Under our law, what has to be established by a prisoner who claims the

benefit of exception 1 to section 294 of the Penal Code is : (1) that he was

given provocation, (2) that the provocation was sudden, (3) that the

provocation was grave, (4) that as a result of the provocation given he lost

his powers of self-control, (5) that whilst deprived of the power of self-control

he committed the act that resulted in the death of the victim.

Further held that:

In the first place, it would be necessary to ascertain what is meant by

provocation. Provocation, according to the dictionary, would be any

annoyance or irritation, and for our purpose it must be defined as anything

that ruffles the temper of a man or incites passion or anger in him or causes

Page 15 of 23

a disturbance of the equanimity of his mind. It may be caused by any

method which would produce any one of the above results-by mere words

which may not amount to abuse or by words of abuse, by a blow with hands

or stick or club or by a pelting of stones or by any other more serious method

of doing personal violence.

The next requisite is that the provocation must be such as to bring it within

the category termed sudden, that is to say, that there should be a close

proximation in time between the acts of provocation and of retaliation-

which is a question of fact. This element is of importance in reaching a

decision as to whether the time that elapsed between the giving of

provocation and the committing of the retaliatory act was such as to have

afforded and did in fact afford the assailant an opportunity of regaining his

normal composure, in other words, whether there had been a " cooling " of

his temper.

The third element is that the provocation should be grave. That is the

element with which we are concerned particularly in this case. Provocation

would be grave where an ordinary or average man of the class to which this

accused belongs would feel annoyed or irritated by the provocation given to

the extent that he would, smarting under the provocation given, resent the

act of provocation or retaliate it. It is entirely dependent upon the act of the

provoker and cannot be said to be based upon the nature or mode of

resentment adopted by the person provoked in giving expression to his

resentment.

In the instant case, the 1st Accused is the landlord who had rented out his premises

to several people. By the evidence, it is established that on the day in question, the

deceased had a dispute with PW1, Deepika. Thereafter, at night, the tenants were

complaining about the failure of the electricity. The deceased who were the cause

of this disconnection, annoyed the Accused, demanding electricity. Furthermore,

Page 16 of 23

the Police had come at night to inquire regarding the complaint made by PW1

which also involved the deceased.

This series of incidents had provoked the 1st Accused. We are mindful that the 1st

Accused was the landlord and the deceased were tenants. Because of the failure

to pay the bill by the tenants who are deceased, there was an interruption of

electricity. The deceased themselves started to irritate the Accused by questioning

why there was no electricity.

Our Courts have considered how a reasonable man would react to provocation and

whether he is able to self-control.

In Jamis v. The Queen, 53 NLR, 401, at page 403, His Lordship Gratiaen J. held

that;

With regard to this ground of objection,' we have been confronted with a

recent decision to the contrary effect in Rex v. David Appuhamy et

al.1[(1952) 53 N. L. R. 313] in which the majority of a Bench of three Judges

had ruled that a charge to the jury in almost precisely similar terms did

amount to a misdirection. It was there conceded that the element of gravity

did in fact introduce an objective standard, but the Court decided that, for

the purposes of Exception 1, the provocation given would be sufficiently "

grave " if it were " such as would cause deep resentment in the mind of a

man ", or, to quote another passage, sufficient merely " to cause the ordinary

man of the class to which the accused belongs to lose his temper ". This

formula purported apparently to draw a distinction between provocation of

a kind which may cause a mere loss of temper from provocation which is

likely (although not necessarily certain) to result in an ordinary man losing

his power of self-control.

Page 17 of 23

In the present case, the learned Judge's charge to the Jury as to the test of

" gravity " in relation to the plea of provocation was substantially the same

as the following direction in the summing-up in Naide's case (supra) which

is quoted in a passage labelled " A " in the dissenting judgment of my Lord

the Acting Chief Justice :-

"A. It is important that you should not forget the emphasis that the

law places on the need that the provocation should be grave. It must

be provocation of a kind that a man belonging to the class of society

to which the accused belongs would reasonably be expected to resent,

and it must be provocation of such gravity as one would expect a

person of that class to resent so deeply as to temporarily deprive him

of the power of self-control."

In Muthu Banda v. The Queen, 56 NLR 217, at page 218, Her Ladyship Rose, J

held that:

The direction criticized in this appeal is that which expresses the

proposition that in considering whether a particular episode contains the

elements of grave and sudden provocation the jury must apply an objective

test, i.e. whether in the particular case under consideration a reasonable or

average man with the same background and in the same circumstance of

life as the accused would have been provoked into serious retaliation.

Further held that;

The argument, as I understood it, for the appellant was that the jury, in

considering the reaction of the hypothetical reasonable man" to the acts of

provocation, must not only place him in the circumstances in which, the

accused was placed, but must also invest him with the personal physical

Page 18 of 23

peculiarities of the accused. Learned counsel, who argued the case for the

appellant with great ability, did not, I think, venture to say that he should

be invested with mental or temperamental qualities which distinguished

him from the reasonable man ; for this would have been directly in conflict

with the passage from the recent decision of this House in Mancini's case

which I have cited.

Recently, in Premlal v. Attorney General, 2000 (2) SLR 403, at page 407, His

Lordship Kulathilake, J. held that:

Of late we observe a development in other jurisdictions where Courts and

juries have taken a more pragmatic view of the mitigatory plea of

provocation. In a series of cases in applying the mitigatory plea of

provocation Courts took into consideration the prior course of relationship

between the accused and his victim. Vide Jan Muhammad vs. Emperor

Nanavati vs. State of Maharastra and Amarjit Singh Sohan Singh(4)

referred to in the article on "The Doctrine of Continuing Provocation" by Dr.

M. Sornarajah published in the Journal of Ceylon Law, June 1971.

In the latter case Sankaria, J. observed - "The past conduct of the non

earning father in coming home drunk daily ... was already a standing and

continuous source of provocation to the son whose meagre earnings were

hardly sufficient to meet the bare needs of the family. The resentment that

was building up in the mind of the son as a reaction to the continuous

provocative conduct of the father spread over the past month or so, had

reached a breaking point shortly before the occurrence when the drunken

father set upon the son with a torrent of horrible oaths.

Further held on page 411

The contents of this letter is important because it explains the state of mind

of the accused-appellant prior to the act of stabbing and the attempted

suicide. It has to be read in juxtaposition with witness Kulatilaka Bandara's

description of the accused-appellant's behaviour during the period prior to

Page 19 of 23

the act of stabbing. In this regard it is pertinent to refer to the observations

of Agha Haidar, J. (Broadway, J. agreeing) in Jan Muhammad vs. Emperor

(supra)

"Each case must depend upon its own facts and circumstances. In the

present case my view is that, in judging the conduct of the accused, one

must not confine himself to the actual moment when the blow, which

ultimately proved to be fatal, was struck, that is to say, one must not take

into consideration only the event which took place immediately before the

fatal blow was struck. We must take into consideration the previous conduct

of the woman. Her evil ways were the common scandal of the village and

must have been known to the husband, causing him extreme mental agony,

shame and humiliation".

Further, our Courts have also considered whether the Accused had an opportunity

to control his anger.

In Samithamby v. The Queen, 75 NLR 49, at page 50, His Lordship H.N.G.

Fernando, C.J. held that;

In these circumstances, the majority of us considered that in terms of

Exception (1) set out in s. 294 of the Code the attention of the Jury should

have been drawn to the question whether the act of stabbing took place

whilst the accused was deprived of the power of self-control. There was no

doubt an interval of time between the giving of the provocation and the time

of the stabbing, but the provocation given was sudden, in the sense that the

accused must have been taken aback when he realised that his wife wished

him to be dead. The evidence concerning the subsequent period made it

quite probable that in fact the accused all the time suffered under a loss of

self-control. Had this aspect of the matter been presented to the Jury, they

should, in the opinion of the majority of us, have returned the lesser

verdict.

Page 20 of 23

In Rasingolle Weerasinghe Mudiyanselage Nandana Senerathbandara alias

Chandi vs. The Attorney General, SC/Appeal/32/2015 decided on 17.07.2020, His

Lordship Jayantha Jayasuriya, PC, CJ held that:

Jurisprudence referred to above demonstrate that in considering the plea

of grave and sudden provocation an accused is entitled to rely upon a series

of prior events that ultimately led to the incident at which the death was

caused. A court should not restrict its focus to an isolated incident that

resulted in the death, in considering a plea of grave and sudden provocation.

The aforementioned jurisprudence has widened the scope of this plea by

expanding the limitations recognised in its statutory form. Thereby, the

concept of Continuing or Cumulative provocation has been recognised as

a plea coming within the purview of the plea of grave and sudden

provocation recognised under Exception 1, section 294 of the Penal Code.

Therefore, the proximity of time between the actus reus of the accused and

the provocative act of the victim should be considered in the context of the

nature and circumstances in each case, in deciding whether an accused is

entitled to the benefit of the plea of Grave and Sudden Provocation.

In the instant case, there is evidence to show that the actus reus was committed

by the 1st Accused in the heat of the passion whilst being deprived of his self-

control due to the cumulative provocation. We are mindful that the fatal attack

had taken place after a series of events that caused disturbance and irritation that

existed between the Accused and the deceased. Considering that the 1st Accused

is the landlord where the deceased had failed to pay the electricity bill which

resulted in other tenants complaining to him and where the Police had come and

inquired him about a quarrel involving the deceased, it shows that provocation

was sufficient to result in a reasonable man losing his power of self-control. In

addition, the deceaseds wife had continuously irritated the Accused, saying that

Page 21 of 23

the child could not sleep because of the interruption of electricity. That should

have caused mental stress to the 1st Accused.

There is no evidence to show that this was a preplanned attack. We hold that the

Learned Trial Judge failed to consider the evidence placed before her with regard

to the mitigatory plea of cumulative provocation which would have reduced the

conviction to culpable homicide not amounting to murder. We are also mindful

that for an Accused to succeed in the plea of grave and sudden provocation, it could

be proved on a balance of probability.

We are mindful that the Accused, in their defence did not take the defence of grave

and sudden provocation. But the Judge has a duty cast on him to consider such a

plea if it emanates from the evidence of the Prosecution.

In King vs. Widanalage Lanty, 42 NLR 317, His Lordship Moseley SPJ held that

The remaining ground of appeal is that the jury were not directed properly

on the matter of a fight before the deceased was stabbed. That is to say, that

it was not brought to the notice of the jury that there was some evidence

upon which, if they believed it, it was open to them to find that the appellant

was guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, as provided by

exception 4 to section 294 of the Penal Code. The learned Judge did in fact

put it to the jury that, if they were convinced beyond reasonable doubt by

the evidence for the prosecution, it was clearly their duty to find the

appellant guilty of murder, but that, if they believed the defence, they would

not hesitate to acquit him. No question of culpable homicide not amounting

to murder, he said, arose on his defence. It is a fact that no such defence

Page 22 of 23

was put forward by him or on his behalf. In William Hopper ' the defence,

as in this case, was that of accident. In that case, however, Counsel for the

defence indicated that, if that defence

failed, he should hope for a verdict of manslaughter only. But the Court

expressed its view that, even if Counsel had not contended for a verdict of

manslaughter, the Judge was not relieved of the necessity of giving the jury

the opportunity of finding that verdict. In The King v. Bellana Vitanage

Eddin 2 Howard C.J. in referring to a defence that had not been raised nor

relied upon at the trial, said that that fact was not in itself sufficient to

relieve the Judge of the duty of putting this alternative to the jury " if there

was any basis for such a finding in the evidence on the record". A similar

view was expressed in The King v. Albert Appuhamy'.

Applying the principles laid down in the said judicial decision, we hold that the

Learned Trial Judge should have convicted the 1st Accused for the offence of

culpable homicide not amounting to murder under section 297 of the Penal Code

on the basis of grave and sudden provocation.

Regarding the 2nd Accused, there is no iota of evidence to show that she shared a

common intention with the 1st Accused with regard to the murders of both the

deceased. It is true that she had gone with the 1st Accused around 9 oclock. But

there was no evidence to show that the deceased were murdered at that time.

Thereafter, the 1st Accused had gone alone with a knife. We are mindful that the

medical evidence revealed that both the deceased had cut injuries. According to

PW4, she had seen the 1st Accused going alone with a manna knife. But the

Learned High Court Judge had misdirected herself that the 2nd Accused had also

gone with the 1st Accused at the 2nd time.

For the said reasons, we set aside the conviction of murder and the death sentence

imposed on the 2nd Accused.

Page 23 of 23

Against the 1st Accused, we substitute a conviction of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder, which is an offence under Section 297 of the Penal Code

under grave and sudden provocation.

We sentence the 1st Accused to a term of 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for

each count and to run concurrently. Accordingly, the sentence of imprisonment

shall take effect from the date of conviction, 22.03.2017.

The fine imposed by the Learned Trial Judge on each count remains unaltered.
