The Petitioner is a limited liability company incorporated under the Companies Act. The Petitioner

is engaging in a business of importing and sale of industrial chemicals and the business of an

Page 6 of 11

indenting agent for industrial chemicals, by receiving orders from third party importers for

transmission to foreign principal/supplier. The Petitioner states that the process of placing orders

under the said business took place as such that the Petitioner did not have any authority from the

foreign principal to accept the orders placed by the said third party importers and the Petitioner

only transmitted the said orders to the said foreign principal. The Petitioner further states that for

the services obtained by the foreign principal the Petitioner has received a remuneration by way

of commission on orders accepted and executed by the said foreign principal.

It is the first contention of the Petitioner that the aforesaid services supplied by the Petitioner to

the foreign principal was zero-rated in terms of section 7(1)(b)(vii) and section 7(1)(c) of the Value

Added Tax Act (hereinafter sometimes will be referred to as the VAT Act), as the commission was

received in foreign currency through bank in Sri Lanka and the said services supplied by the

Petitioner are utilized outside Sri Lanka. The Petitioner further states that no payments have been

incurred from any third-party importer in respect of the aforesaid services supplied by the

Petitioner.

Further, the Petitioner states that the Petitioner has sold a car and a motorcycle, used by the office

staff, as well as a fax machine and a photocopier, for the amount of Rs. 3,842,000. Additionally, a

payment of Rs. 299,005 has been received by the Petitioner as insurance indemnity for damages

incurred to the Petitioners vehicle. The Petitioner contends that the Petitioner is not involved in

the business of selling cars, motorcycles, fax machines, or photocopiers and the insurance

indemnity received by the Petitioner neither constitute a taxable activity of the Petitioner nor in

the course of carrying out taxable activity under section 2 of the VAT Act. Accordingly, the

Petitioner has made the VAT returns for the taxable period of November 2002 to December 2003,

However, the payment has been rejected by the 2nd Respondent by the letter dated 4th of January

2006 made in terms of section 29 and section 33 of the VAT Act No 14 of 2002.

Accordingly, it is the contention of the Petitioner that section 29 of the VAT Act does not permit

communication to refer more than one taxable period, and it requires separate communication to

be made for each taxable period. Thereafter, the Petitioner received a notice of assessment dated

11th of March 2006, relating to the taxable period November 2002 and December 2003. It is the

Page 7 of 11

contention of the Petitioner that the said Notice of assessment for the taxable period of December

2003 is ultra vires as it is time-barred in terms of section 33 of the VAT Act, further it also includes

several other taxable periods within the aforesaid taxable period of December 2003. Accordingly,

the Petitioner has appealed the aforesaid notice of Assessment on 27th of March 2006, which was

acknowledged by the 2nd Respondent. The Petitioner states that the evidence was adduced and the

appeal was heard by the 4th Respondent. The determination of the said appeal was received by the

Petitioner on the 10th of April 2008.

Being dissatisfied with the said order, the Petitioner preferred an appeal dated 21st of May 2008 to

the Board of Review against the determination by the 4th Respondent. The appeal was heard by

the board of review, and both parties have submitted their written submissions. However, the board

of review ceased to function, therefore, the aforesaid appeal was heard by the tax appeals

commission, and the determination was delivered on 28th of February 2013.

Being aggrieved by the said determinations, the Petitioner has now made a writ application to

quash the determinations made by the Respondents.

The Respondents state that the determination dated 28th of February 2013 of the Tax Appeals

Commission is based on the following issues.

a. Should the Appellant Company be taxed at the concessionary 0% rate as stipulated in

Section 7 (1) (C) of the VAT Act?

b. Should the sale of Capital assets be liable for VAT at the rate of 20%?

c. Are amounts received under a contract of insurance liable for VAT?

For a company to be treated as zero-rated tax in term of Section 7 (1) (C) of the VAT Act, the

service provided should be outside Sri Lanka. It is the contention of the Respondent that the

Petitioner serves as an agent to foreign manufacturers who are outside Sri Lanka, who are the

principal for the goods of 3rd party buyers. The payment is received by the Petitioner in foreign

currency through a local bank. However, it is the Respondent's view that these goods are consumed

in Sri Lanka within the manufacturing process of the said buyer. Therefore, the Respondents claim

Page 8 of 11

that the Petitioner cannot be entitled to a 0% concessionary rate under section 7 (1)(c) of the VAT

Act, as the requirement that the services used and consumed outside Sri Lanka is not met.

Further, it is the view of the Respondent that the sale of the capital assets of the Petitioner falls

within the scope of section 2(1)(b)(ii), thereby subjecting it to a 20% tax rate. Further, the

Petitioner, being a registered company in Sri Lanka, carrying on a taxable activity, in the

performance of acts in transferring the ownership of the goods exclusively to the new buyer,

performs the necessary actions to come within what is defined as supply of goods. Therefore, the

Respondent contends that the Petitioner performs a taxable activity which makes him liable for a

payment under the VAT Act.

The next contention of the Respondent is that the amount received under a contract of insurance

for the damage caused to the capital asset of the car is considered a taxable activity. The Petitioner

has received the insurance indemnity under the insurance policy on the capital assets while

carrying out a taxable activity. Therefore, it is the view of the Respondents that the claim made by

the Petitioner regarding a loss incurred on the damage to the car is a supply of service as envisaged

under section 83 of the VAT Act.

According to section 7 (1)(c) of the VAT Act, there are three requirements that need to be fulfilled

for a service to be qualified under zero rated concession.

(c) any other service, being a service not referred to in paragraph (b), provided by any person in

Sri Lanka to another person outside Sri Lanka to be consumed or utilized outside Sri Lanka shall

be zero rated provided that payment for such service in full has been received in foreign currency

from outside Sri Lanka through a bank in Sri Lanka

The first or the second requirement is not contended by either party. The third requirement ensures

that the service provided shall be utilized or consumed outside Sri Lanka. It is the Respondents

view that the services provided by the Petitioner in the present matter are utilized and consumed

within Sri Lanka, as the goods are transferred by the foreign principal to the third party, which

shall be consumed in Sri Lanka. However, it must be noted that the Petitioner is neither a party to

Page 9 of 11

the contract between the third party and the foreign principal nor has the Petitioner received any

payment from the third party. Therefore, it is apparent that the Petitioner has acted within the

capacity of a commissioned agent to the foreign principal.

Had the Petitioner approached this Court through an appeal application, the Court might have

considered the position mentioned above, likely in favor of the Appellant. However, since the

Petitioner has instead filed a writ application, it is important to note certain specific aspects related

to the issuance of writs. Unlike appeals, which involve a review of decisions made by lower courts,

writ applications are extraordinary remedies that the Court grants only under special

circumstances. Therefore, the Court must carefully examine whether the conditions for issuing a

writ are met before granting relief in this case.

In the case of Pradeshiya Sabawa, Hingurakgoda, and others Vs. Karunaratne and others

(2006) 2 Sri L R 419, Andrew Somawansa, J.(P/CA) has established the grounds on which a

writ of certiorari can be granted.

The grounds of issue of writs of certiorari are :

(a) acting in excess of jurisdiction or ultra vires;

(b) breach of a mandatory provision or rule;

(c) breach of rules of natural justice;

(d) error of law on the face of the record;

It is the contention of the Petitioner that the Respondents have acted ultra vires, by considering

irrelevant factors and by failing to consider relevant matters in making the determination.

However, when exercising the discretionary remedy of this court under Writ Jurisdiction, the

Petitioners conduct, and circumstances of the case needs to be noted.

In Bisomenike Vs. C. R. de Alwis (1982) 1SLR 368, Sharvananda, J, observed that;

"A Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court. It cannot be held to be a Writ

of right or one issued as a matter of course. The exercise of this discretion by Court is

Page 10 of 11

governed by certain well accepted principles. The Court is bound to issue it at the instance

of a party aggrieved by the order of an inferior tribunal except in cases where he has

disentitled himself to the discretionary relief by reason of his own conduct, submitting to

jurisdiction, laches, undue delay or waiver The proposition that the Application for Writ

must be sought as soon as injury is caused is merely an Application of the equitable

doctrine that delay defeats equity and the longer the injured person sleeps over his rights

without any reasonable excuse the chance of his success in Writ Application dwindles and

the Court may reject a Writ Application on the ground of unexplained delay. An

Application for a Writ of Certiorari should be filled within a reasonable time"

In the present matter the Petitioner is seeking the writ of certiorari and prohibition by an application

filed in the Court of Appeal in 2013, to claim from this court a discretionary relief in respect of an

alleged order made on the 11th of March 2006 against the letter of assessment by the 2nd

Respondent, the determination dated 9th of April 2008 by the 4th Respondent, and against the

determination dated 28th of February 2013 by the Tax Appeal Commission respectively. However,

it is apparent that there is a significant delay in exercising the discretionary remedy of this court,

which is best known to the Petitioner. Further, the Petitioner has failed to exercise the remedy to

appeal against the determination of the commission under section 11A of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act No. 23 of 2011.

11A (1) Either the person who preferred an appeal to the Commission under paragraph

(a) of subsection (1) of section 7 of this Act (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the

appellant) or the Commissioner-General may make an application requiring the

Commission to state a case on a question of law for the opinion of the Court of Appeal.

Such application shall not be entertained unless it is made in writing and delivered to the

secretary to the Commission, together with a fee of one thousand and five hundred rupees,

within one month from the date on which the decision of the Commission was notified in

writing to the Commissioner-General or the appellant, as the case may be..

Page 11 of 11

Therefore, it is evident that the Petitioner has failed to avail himself of the statutory remedy

provided under Section 11A by appealing against the determination of the Tax Appeal

Commission in the matter of the law for the reasons best known to him. The Petitioner now seeks

to quash determinations made from the year 2006 onwards, exercising a discretionary remedy from

this court, 7 years after the date that the determination was entered.

When considering the facts of this case, it is evident that the Petitioner has approached this court

after significant latches, and the Petitioner has also failed to exercise the direct statutory remedy

available. Moreover, the Petitioner has failed to provide any reason to justify his action in terms

of the delay and failure to exercise the statutory remedy. Therefore, I am of the view that the

discretionary remedy of this court, provided under Article 140 of the Constitution, need not be

invoked.

Therefore, this application is dismissed.

No cost ordered.
