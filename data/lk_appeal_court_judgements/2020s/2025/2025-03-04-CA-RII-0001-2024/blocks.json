After trial, the Learned Additional District Judge of Avissawella delivered the judgment, allowing the partition of the land as per the shares given in the judgment. There was no appeal against that judgment. The case has been called for several days to submit a commission for partition. On 12-02-2021, the plaintiff stated that he did not wish to proceed with the action. Thereafter, 5A defendant undertook to prosecute the action. As the 5A defendant failed to submit a commission for partition, the Learned Additional District Judge dismissed the action. 1A defendant-petitioner filed this application before this court seeking to set aside the dismissal of the action. On behalf of 1A defendant-petitioner, it was submitted that when 5A defendant failed to take necessary steps, other parties should have been allowed to proceed with the action.",
