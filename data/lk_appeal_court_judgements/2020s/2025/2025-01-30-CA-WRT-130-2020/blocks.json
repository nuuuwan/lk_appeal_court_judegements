Further, it is stated that the Petitioner was absorbed into the Regular Service on 21st October 2018 by the letter dated 09th April 2016. The Petitioner claims that he is entitled to be paid arrears of salary for the period from 28th April 1996 to 17th July 2017. However, it is abundantly clear that during such time the Petitioner was a Reservist of the Police Reserve Service. The powers and functions regarding the appointments, transfers and disciplinary matters of the Police Reserve Service have not been vested with the NPC during such time.",
