JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) has

been indicted in the High Court of Kandy in High Court case no. 22/09.

2. The charge in the indictment is as follows;

That on or about 02.11.2007, at Matale, within the

jurisdiction of this Court, the appellant has committed the

offence of cheating on a total sum of Rs. 5,175,000.00 on

PW1, by promising him that he would sell a Toyota Allion

motor vehicle, and accepting a sum of Rs. 3,175,000.00 as

3

an advance and thereby committing an offence punishable

under and in terms of section 403 of the Penal Code.

3. Upon the appellant pleading not guilty to the charge in the indictment,

the trial has commenced and at the conclusion of the same the Learned

High Court Judge has found the appellant guilty of the charge,

convicted and sentenced him to one-year rigorous imprisonment.

Further, has also imposed a fine of Rs.5000/- with a term of three

months simple imprisonment, in default of the payment of the fine.

4. Aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence imposed, the appellant

has preferred the instant appeal to this Court.

The grounds of appeal

5. When the matter was taken up for argument, the learned counsel for

the appellant urged the following grounds of appeal:

i. The ingredients of the charge of cheating have not been

proved.

ii. The evidence of PW1 and PW2 have not been properly

analysed by the Learned High Court Judge.

4

iii. No proper reasoning has been given in terms of section 283

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 by the

Learned High Court Judge when delivering the disputed

judgment.

6. Before considering the submissions made by the Learned Counsel for

the appellant in support of the above mentioned grounds of appeal and

also the submissions made by the Learned Deputy Solicitor General

who represented the complainant-respondent, this Court finds it

relevant to consider the facts that had come to light in the trial Court.

Facts in brief

7. PW1, the person who had been purportedly cheated, has come back to

Sri Lanka after being employed overseas for several years. Back in Sri

Lanka, PW1 has been looking for an investment opportunity. Though

his initial plan had been to invest in an immovable property PW1 had

been informed by PW2, i.e. a middle-man, who was engaged in finding

buyers for vehicles, that there was a Toyota Allion motor car for sale at

a discounted price.

5

8. Upon receiving such information PW1 has concluded that it would be

better for him to purchase the particular car and rent it to generate an

income. Thereafter, he has gone to the relevant vehicle sales centre

owned by the appellant with PW2. PW1, PW2 and the appellant have

been relatives, and known to each other. At the vehicle sales centre, the

appellant has shown the particular car to PW1 and informed the latter

that the sale price of the particular car after a discount was Rs.

5,500,000.00. Offering a further discount, the appellant has agreed to

sell the particular car for a sum of Rs. 5,175,000.00. Since PW1 has

been informed that there were several others also interested in

purchasing the particular car, PW1 has handed over a sum of Rs.

3,175,000.00 in cash to the appellant on 02.11.2007 while agreeing to

pay the balance sum within two weeks time and take possession of the

particular car at that time.

9. When PW1 went back to the relevant vehicle sales centre he has found

such business premises deserted and the car he intended to purchase

also missing. Though PW1 had tried to contact the appellant thereafter,

he has failed in his endeavour. Sometime later PW1 has been able to

track down the appellant. In that instance, though the appellant had

promised to hand over the particular car to PW1, he has failed to do so.

10. Thereafter, the appellant has issued a cheque for a value of the sum

made as a part payment and obtained from PW1 in lieu of the particular

6

car, but the cheque has been dishonoured by the relevant bank. Upon

realising that he has been cheated PW1 has made a complaint to the

Criminal Investigation Department.

11. The appellant has suggested to PW1 in cross-examination that he

never agreed to sell a car nor did he receive any money from PW1. It

has been further suggested that the transaction referred to in the

charge had taken place between PW1 and PW2, and the appellant

issued the cheque which was subsequently dishonoured, as security in

respect of the transaction that took place between the former.

12. At the conclusion of the prosecutions case, the Learned High Court

Judge has decided to call for a defence on the basis that there were

grounds for proceeding with the trial.

13. The appellant has not given evidence or made a dock statement but

has remained silent. Further, though he had informed the Learned High

Court Judge initially that he did not intend to call witnesses on his

behalf, he has subsequently proceeded to adduce evidence of an officer

from a bank on his behalf.

14. At the hearing of this appeal, the Learned Counsel for the appellant

agreed that though the evidence led through by such officer refers to a

7

sum similar to that stated in the charge, that the witness he has failed

to establish a connection of the sum referred to, to the sum stated in

the charge preferred against the appellant.

Consideration of the grounds of appeal

15. It was the contention of the Learned Counsel for the appellant that the

prosecution had failed to prove a material ingredient in the offence

stated in the charge i.e. the deception of PW1 by the appellant. If at all

it was PW2 who deceived PW1 into making part payment to the

appellant in order to purchase the car in question. Also, that the

Learned High Court Judge has failed to analyse the evidence in the

correct perspective.

16. It was the position of the Counsel for the appellant that although the

Learned High Court Judge had determined that there were no

contradictions or omissions in the evidence of PW1 and PW2, it was not

a correct determination.

17. PW1 has stated that he had discussions with regard to the sale of the

particular car at his house in Mattale, but subsequently contradicted

himself when he stated that such discussion took place over the phone

with PW2. The evidence of PW2 had been that he went to the car sales

8

centre only on the day the money was paid by PW1 to the appellant.

However, the evidence of PW1 had been that he together with PW2 went

to the car sales centre on several occasions.

18. This Court has been appraised that the discrepancies in evidence

referred to above were material and they should have been considered

in favour of the appellant by the Learned High Court Judge instead of

determining that there were no contradictions or omissions in the

evidence of those witnesses.

19. The submission of the Learned Deputy Solicitor General was that the

evidence must be evaluated in an overall context and not in a piecemeal

basis. The Learned Deputy Solicitor General has drawn the attention of

this Court to the relationship that existed between the parties, which in

turn had led PW1 to believe that he could purchase the particular car

from the appellant at a discounted price. It was also pointed out that

the actual deception was not the information provided by PW2 to PW1

but the statement made by the appellant to PW1, which caused the

latter make a part payment to the appellant believing that the particular

car could be purchased from the appellant. The Learned Deputy

Solicitor General also referred to the evidence of PW1 which appears at

page 84 of the appeal brief where it has been stated that when PW1 met

the appellant, the former was shown the particular car and stated that

several persons were interested in purchasing the same but since the

9

appellant and PW1 were relatives, the particular car could be sold to

PW1 at a discounted price if the consideration was paid in cash. The

Learned Deputy Solicitor General has also contended that the alleged

discrepancies do not go into the core of the issue and are matters that

do not affect the credibility of the prosecution case. He was also of the

view that the Learned High Court Judge had imposed a lenient sentence

on the appellant upon conviction. The Learned Deputy Solicitor General

has moved that the appeal be dismissed for want of merit.

20. The offence of cheating punishable in terms of section 403 of the Penal

Code Act No. 50 of 1980 has been delineated in section 398 of the same

which reads as follows;

Whoever by deceiving any person fraudulently or

dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any

property to any person, or to consent that any person shall

retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so

deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do

or omit if he were not so deceived and which act or omission

causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person

in body, mind, reputation, or property, or damage or loss to

the government, is said to cheat.

10

21. Although it was argued that the deception that needed to be proved in

a case of cheating had not been established by the prosecution, I find

no basis to agree with such contention. It is very clear that PW2 who

was the middle-man had only facilitated a deal between the appellant

and PW1 by directing/introducing PW1 to the appellant. It is also clear

that it was the appellant who have had the particular car in his car

sales centre and informed PW1 that the particular car was for sale. It

has been clearly established that PW1 had been deceived to pay a sum

of Rs. 3,175,000.00 to the appellant due to the utterance of the latter

to the effect that there were several other persons interested in

purchasing the particular car and that it would be sold to PW1 at a

discounted price since he was a relative of the appellant and the

payment was to be made in cash by PW1.

22. It is the view of this Court that as pointed out by the Learned Deputy

Solicitor General, the appellant has deceived PW1 to hand over the

money to the former believing what the appellant had stated to him.

Hence, this Court find no rationale in the first ground of appeal urged

by the appellant.

23. As regards to the second and third grounds of appeal, it is the view of

this Court that any contradiction or omission in evidence need to be

material to effect the case of a particular party to a trial. A trivial

11

contradiction or omission which does not go into the root of a case

cannot be considered a reason to reject the evidence of a witness. This

Court is of the view that the discrepancies in the evidence referred to

by the appellant are so trivial that they do not create a doubt as regards

to the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution. When, such evidence

is taken into consideration in its totality, it is clear that PW1 had made

a part payment to the appellant in the belief that he could purchase the

particular car which the appellant had offered to sell to him at a

discounted price.

24. Although the Learned High Court Judge may not have dealt with the

evidence in much detail, this Court finds that the Learned High Court

judge has considered the evidence that is material in the correct

perspective.

25. This Court is unable to find a misdirection of the Learned High Court

in regard to the evaluation of evidence and the law that needs to be

considered when determining a matter of the nature of the charge

stated in the indictment.

26. Though it was submitted that the evidence of PW1 and PW2 were not

cogent, it needs to be noted that PW2 has corroborated the narrative of

12

PW1. Further, PW2 has not been cross-examined, which connote that

the evidence of PW2 has not been disputed by the appellant.

27. Even though the Learned Counsel for the appellant had contended

that PW2s evidence has not been disputed because the latter's evidence

does not corroborate the evidence of PW1, this Court finds such a claim

to be an excuse for the failure of the appellant to dispute the evidence

of PW2 at a material instance.

28. Another matter to which the attention of this Court is drawn to is the

failure by the appellant to create a reasonable doubt as to the evidence

placed before the trial court or at a minimum failure to offer a

reasonable explanation in that regard.

29. It is settled law that an accused person need not prove anything and

it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the charge against an accused

beyond a reasonable doubt. However, once the prosecution adduces

cogent incriminating evidence, an accused in those circumstances was

required by law to offer an explanation of such cogent and incriminating

evidence led against him.

13

30. It has been suggested to PW1 in cross examination that the sum

referred to in the charge contained in the indictment was given by PW1

to PW2 and not to the appellant. This Court finds that the evidence led

in the case does not support such a proposition under any

circumstance. This Court finds such proposition to be a concocted story

of the appellant in his endeavour to absolve himself of the charge.

31. For reasons as considered above, I am not inclined to interfere with

the disputed judgment together with the sentence.

32. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of merit. I make no order

regarding cost

33. The Registrar of this Court is requested to communicate this judgment

to the High Court of Kandy for compliance.

Appeal dismissed.
