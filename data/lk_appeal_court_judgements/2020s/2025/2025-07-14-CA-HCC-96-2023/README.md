JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) has

been indicted in the High Court of Hambantota in High Court case

number HC 18/2016.

2. The charge in the indictment is as follows,

Charge 01

That on or about March 23,2004, at Sisilasa Gama, within the

jurisdiction of this Court, the accused along with another, by

stealing of cash and jewellery valued at Rs. 137,750.00

belonging to one Sarath Hewarathne by using firearms,

committed the offence of robbery with an attempt to cause

death or grievous hurt, an offence punishable under and in

terms of section 383 of the Penal Code read with section 32.

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge has

convicted the appellant of the charge and sentenced him to five years

Page 3 of 9

rigorous imprisonment and also imposed a fine of Rs.5000.00 with a

term of six months rigorous imprisonment in default. The Learned High

Court Judge has also ordered the appellant to pay a sum of

Rs.137,750.00 as compensation to PW01 with a term of one year

rigorous imprisonment in default. Further, he has also ordered that the

terms in default shall run consecutively.

4. Aggrieved by the conviction and the disputed judgment together with

the sentencing order, the appellant has preferred the instant appeal to

this Court.

Case of the prosecution

5. On March 23,2024, PW01, a businessman, has returned to his

residence at around 8.00pm after completing his daily business

activities.

6. His paddy-mill where he conducted his operations has been located on

the ground floor of the same building while his residence occupied the

second floor.

7. At approximately 08.15pm that evening, two armed intruders have

entered PW01s residence. Notably, the intruders have purportedly been

exposing their faces suggesting a level of confidence in their actions.

They have gathered the household members into the living area and

immediately begun to demand valuables.

8. During the robbery, the intruders have targeted the gold-chain and the

gold-ring that PW01 was wearing at that time. Although they have

attempted to seize the pair of earrings worn by PW01s daughter, i.e.

PW03, they have relented upon PW01s request.

9. In addition to these items, the intruders also have robbed various pieces

of jewellery from the residence and a sum of cash amounting to Rs.

44,000.00 before making their escape.

Case of the appellant

10. The appellant has asserted that he has been falsely implicated in the

charge outlined in the indictment.

Grounds of appeal

11. When the matter was taken up for argument, the Learned Counsel for

the appellant urged the following grounds of appeal;

i. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that

the identification of the appellant has not been

established.

ii. The erroneous findings of the Learned High Court Judge

have adversely affected the appellant.

iii. The Learned High Court Judge has arrived at his judgment

without properly considering the dock statement of the

appellant.

iv. The prosecution has failed to prove the charge beyond a

reasonable doubt.

12. It has been acknowledged that the identification parade in connection

to the incident in question has been held 8 years after the occurrence.

During this parade, PW01 along with his now deceased wife have

Page 5 of 9

participated as witnesses. It is important to note that PW01s wife was

unable to provide testimony at the trial due to her passing prior to the

proceedings.

13. In his testimony, PW01 has referred to the identification parade,

affirming that he identified the appellant, during that event. In open

Court, he has reiterated that the individual he identified as the

perpetrator was indeed the same person standing in trial. However,

during cross-examination, significant inconsistencies, in PW01s

testimony has come to light. It has been revealed that he had

contradicted himself regarding the physical features of the appellant

when describing him in Court, compared to earlier descriptions made

during his statement, to the investigating officers.

14. Additionally, PW01 has disclosed that the appellant has visited his

business premises on two prior occasions. This revelation raised

questions about his ability to confidently identify the appellant at the

identification parade, as it was information not included in his initial

statement to the investigation officers. These discrepancies call into

question the reliability of PW01s identification and whether his

identification of the appellant was influenced by prior encounters rather

than by identification parade itself.

15. The identification of the appellant further raises critical issues

regarding the credibility of witness's testimony as well as the integrity of

the identification parade, especially given the 8 year delay between the

incident and the parade. The inconsistencies of PW01s testimony and

the absence of corroborating testimony from his deceased wife further

underscore the complexities.

16. In the case of Queen vs V.P.Julis [1953] 65 NLR 505 at 510-511,

Basnakaye, C.J. has held that,

The identification of the accused at a parade held before the trial

is not substantive evidence at the trial. The fact that the witness

has been able to identify the accused at the identification parade

is only a circumstance corroborative of the identification at the

trial. The jury can act only on the evidence given before them.

There is no section of the evidence ordinance which declares

proceedings at an identification parade to be evidence as to the

fact of identity. The principal evidence of identification is the

evidence of the witness given in court as to how and under what

circumstances he came to pick out a particular accused person

and the details of the part which the accused took in the crime in

question.

17. In the landmark case of Rex vs Turnball [1997] QB 224 important

guidelines were established for trial Court Judges regarding the handling

of disputed identification evidence. Accordingly, a Judge should be

mindful that;

A witness who is honest, maybe wrong even if the witness is

convinced that he is right.

A witness who is convincing may still be wrong.

A witness who recognizes the defendant even when the

witness knows the defendant very well, maybe wrong.

Page 7 of 9

The Judge should direct the jury to examine the circumstances

in which the identification by each witness can be made. Some

of these circumstances may include;

The length of time the accused was observed by the witness.

The state of the light.

The length of time elapsed between the original observation

and the subsequent identification of the accused.

18. In considering the testimony of PW03, it is important to note that she

has not only made a dock identification of the appellant but has also

exhibited inconsistencies regarding her description of the appellants

features and her account of previous encounters with the appellant

before such identification.

19. During her testimony PW03 has provided a description of the appellant

that appear contradicting her prior statement to the investigating

officers. Such discrepancies undermine the credibility of her

identification as they suggest a lack of clarity in her memory or a possible

mischaracterisation of the appellant.

20. Additionally, as PW01 has done, PW03 has also mentioned having

previously accosted the appellant on two previous occasions before

making the identification. However, PW03 has not been able to

consistently articulate the nature of these encounters. In those

circumstances, it also raises legitimate concerns regarding the validity of

her identification.

21. In Munirathne and Others vs. The State, [2001] 2 SLR 382, Kulathilake,

J, has held,

Jurists on evidence have expressed the view that it is

undesirable and unsafe for the Court to rely upon the

identification of an accused in Court for the first time or dock

identification. The reason being that a witness may well think

to himself that the police must have got hold of the right person

and it is, so easy for a witness to point to the accused in the

dock.

44-45; Archbold-Criminal Pleadings, Evidence and Practice

2000th Edition paragraph 14-2, 14-10 page 1303-1304;

Phipson on Evidence 15th Edition 14-17 page 321 and also R

vs. Howick 1970 Cr. L.R.403.

22. In reviewing the Learned High Court Judges judgment, it appears

evident that there has been reliance on the perceived weaknesses within

the appellants case, suggesting that the inconsistencies in the

appellants case were leveraged to strengthen the prosecutions position.

23. It is a fundamental tenet of legal proceedings that the burden of proof

lies squarely with the prosecution. The responsibility to establish a case

beyond a reasonable doubt, fall upon the prosecution, irrespective of any

shortcomings or inconsistencies that may arise in the appellants case.

The focus should not be on the appellants alleged inconsistencies but

rather on whether the evidence presented by the prosecution meets the

requisite standard for a conviction.

Page 9 of 9

24. This reliance on the weaknesses of the appellants case is not only a

misapplication of legal principles but also undermines the integrity of the

judicial process. The prosecution should be able to substantiate its

claims without invoking the flaws of the opposing argument.

25. Due to the matters referred to above, I am inclined to interfere with the

disputed judgment together with the sentencing order. I set aside the

conviction and the disputed judgment together with the sentencing order

and acquit the appellant of the charge.

Appeal allowed.

I make no order regarding cost.

26. The Registrar is directed to communicate this judgment to the High

Court of Hambantota for compliance.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

B. SASI MAHENDRAN, J.
