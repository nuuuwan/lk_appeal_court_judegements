JUDGEMENT

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J

1. The petitioner is seeking writs in the nature of certiorari and mandamus,

primarily seeking a writ of mandamus directing the 1st respondent for a

divesting Order under Section 39A of the Land Acquisition Act No. 09 of

1950 (hereinafter referred to as the Act). The original vesting Order was

in respect of a land in extent of 1 rood and 20 perches depicted in Plan

No.181, dated 13.11.1981, prepared by Licensed Surveyor Aelian

Rajapakse. The original vesting Order in terms of Section 38A of the Act

was published in Gazette Notification bearing No. 221/3, dated

29.11.1982.

2. Thereafter, the Order under Section 07 of the Act was published in

Gazette Notification bearing No. 2009/22, dated 22.02.2017, according

to which the land was described under six lots as depicted in the

preliminary Plan No. PP.Nu.2914 of 26.11.2013, prepared by the

Surveyor General. This notice was published for the purposes of

determining compensation. The original owners in respect of all six lots

were Rajapakshe Appuhamilage Dona Magiperera and her daughter

Rajapakshe Appuhamilage Dona Emilda Perera (the petitioner of this

application). Prior to the publication of the said Notice under Section 7,

the petitioner requested for the divesting of an unutilized parcel of 9.25

perches of the total extent of 1 rood and 20 perches originally vested.

The original request for the divesting Order was made by letter dated

30.12.2013 by the petitioner to the Divisional Secretary.

3. The said land was originally acquired for the purpose of providing

parking for the local authority, namely the Municipal Council of Nuwara

Eliya. This portion of land, admittedly, remains unutilized for the

WRT/0007/19

Page 5 of 24

purpose acquired and is not required for any other public purpose

either. The Divisional Secretary has by his letter dated 09.08.2011

informed the Municipal Commissioner that the unutilized portion be

surveyed and demarcated and accordingly Plan bearing No. 1706B was

prepared. The said parcel of land is now separately defined and

demarcated and depicted as Lot No. 2 in Plan No. 1706B prepared by

licensed surveyor R. Wickramasinghe dated 20.02.1987 (P-2).

4. The said request for divesting had been considered by the Divisional

Secretary and the Municipal Council of Nuwara Eliya, and as the said

portion of land had not been utilized for the original public purpose

acquired and not required for any other, it was decided have the same

divested. Then as stated above, upon so determining the request and the

recommendation for divesting had been made to the 1st respondent the

Minister of Lands, by the Chief Secretary of the Central Province by

letter, dated 30.12.2015, bearing Reference No. //1/21/08/15.

5. When the divesting Order was pending, the 3rd respondent Minister of

Provincial Councils and Local Government, has inquired into objections

by certain persons who claim to be heirs of Rajapakshe Appuhamilage

Dona Magiperera (who was since deceased) and decided to revoke the

original recommendation and request to divest. The basis is that the

divesting of a part of the original land would affect the rights of the heirs.

The 3rd respondent has conveyed this to the Minister of Lands by letter

P-16, dated 23.11.2016. The divesting has not proceeded thereon. The

respondents concede to this in the objections.

6. This application had been filed consequent upon the said decision being

made and the petitioner is inter alia seeking a writ of certiorari to quash

the said decision made by P-16, dated 23.11.2016. Paragraph 2 of the

said letter confirms that a recommendation to divest 9.25 perches which

remained unutilized had been conveyed to the Minister of Lands. The

said paragraph reads as follows:

WRT/0007/19

Page 6 of 24

02. //1/21/08/15

2015.12.30

9.25

.

7. Having so said by paragraph 5 thereof, the 3rd respondent revokes and

cancels the original recommendation to divest, on the basis that

divesting a portion would cause injustice to other heirs of Dona Magi

Perera. The said paragraph reads as follows:

05.

.

8. The relevant arguments advanced in opposition to this application, by

the respective learned Counsel on behalf of the respondents, are:

i) no formal request or application had been made to the 1st

respondent Minister for divesting;

ii) mandamus will not lie as Section 39A vests a discretion;

iii) the petitioner has failed to name all necessary parties;

iv) a partial divesting of land is not possible upon the statutory

interpretation of Section 39A of the Act, especially when the

land is co-owned; and

v) the petitioner has not satisfied all four requirements under

Section 39A (2) of the Act; (i.e.; 39A (2) (d) consent in writing

to take possession).

No formal request or application had been made to the 1st

respondent Minister for divesting.

9. The learned State Counsel, as well as the Counsel for the other

respondents and the intervenient respondents (now added respondents)

in unison argued that the petitioner has failed to make a formal request

for divesting to the Minister of Lands who is vested with the power and

WRT/0007/19

Page 7 of 24

discretion to divest under Section 39A of the Act. Section 39A reads as

follows:

39A. (1) Notwithstanding that by virtue of an Order under section

38 (hereafter in this section referred to as a vesting Order) any

land has vested absolutely in the State and actual possession of

such land has been taken for or on behalf of the State under the

provisions of paragraph (a) of section 40, the Minister may, subject

to subsection (2), by subsequent Order published in the Gazette

(hereafter in this section referred to as a "divesting Order") divest

the State of the land so vested by the aforesaid vesting Order.

10. It is correct that the Minister in charge of the subject of Land is vested

with the power of divesting. Whilst a discretion is so vested, it does not

expressly provide or specify that the request should be made by any

particular person. But in the normal course a request or an intimation

requesting a divesting Order should precede an application for a writ of

mandamus. If a property acquired by a vesting Order has not been

utilized, or is not required for the public purpose which it was so

acquired, or there be no other public purpose for which the said property

is required, then the State will then then no longer have the legitimate

basis to hold and retain the said land. The Minister is of course vested

with a discretion to divest the property under Section 39A provided that

the four requirements as prescribed by subsection (2) of Section 39A are

satisfied.

11. It is now settled law that the Minister should be satisfied of all the four

requirements specified therein (vide Malkavitage Gerard Perera vs.

Ratnayaka Mudiyanselage Chandrawathi Manike Herath,

CA/WRIT/248/2015, decided on 06.03.2019 by Samayawardhena, J).

The said requirements to be satisfied are that compensation had not

been paid, the said land has not been used for the public purpose, no

improvements have been effected, and that the person or persons

WRT/0007/19

Page 8 of 24

interested in the said land have consented in writing to take possession

immediately after the divesting Order is published.

12. In the instant application, it is common ground and evident from the

correspondence and documentation that Lot No. 02 depicted in Plan No.

1706B remains unutilised and is not required for any public purpose

and is now a defined and demarcated portion of the land acquired. Upon

a request being made by the petitioner to the Divisional Secretary of

Nuwara Eliya, the Divisional Secretary has considered this request and

determined that the said Lot No.02 had not been utilised for the public

purpose and is no longer required for any other public purpose, and

recommended the divesting of the same. It is the subsequent objection

raised by the heirs of Magi Perera (now added respondents) that

prompted the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, the

3rd respondent, to revoke and recall the request for a divesting Order.

13. It is significant and relevant to note that this decision is evident from

letter A-16, dated 23.11.2016, written by the 3rd respondent to the

Minister of Lands. Paragraph 2 clearly states that by letter dated

30.12.2015, bearing Reference No. CPC/CS/1/21/08/15, the divesting

of 9.25 perches had been recommended as the same had not been

utilised by the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council. The said paragraph 2

reads as follows:

//1/21/08/15

2015.12.30

9.25

.

14. This clearly establishes that a request and recommendation had been

made to the Minister of Lands to divest a part of the said property that

remained unutilised. Therefore, the argument that no request had been

made to the Minister, is misconceived and erroneous. Further the 3rd

respondent has by paragraph 5 of the said letter, purported to cancel or

WRT/0007/19

Page 9 of 24

revoke the said recommendation to divest made by the aforesaid letter

dated 30.12.2015. Paragraph 5 reads as follows:

.

15. Therefore a request and recommendation has been made and the same

had been cancelled or revoked by the 3rd respondent. The petitioner is

seeking to quash this decision to revoke or cancel the original

recommendation for divesting.

Has the Minister a discretion under Section 39A? Will a mandamus

lie where there is a discretion?

16. Acquiring and vesting of property necessarily results in the deprivation

of a private property and infringes upon proprietary rights. Though

property rights are not directly enshrined or recognized as a

fundamental right, such proprietary rights are well-recognized and

established by international instruments. John Locke (16321704) who

is one of the most influential political philosophers of the modern era

considers the right to property as being a natural right. In Two Treatises

of Government, he propounded and defended the theory that men are by

nature free and equal, against claims that God had made all people

naturally subject to a monarch. However, he argued that right to life,

liberty, and property of the people are natural rights, having a

foundation independent of the laws of such society. Lockes theory is

that people surrender their individual rights to the community and not

to the government, and yet for all, individuals retain the natural rights

of life, liberty, and property [John Locke, The Second Treatise of

Government (1690), The Liberal Arts Press, (New York, 1952)].

17. These natural rights are subject to statutory law. Under the provisions

of the LDO, the deprivation of property of private individuals by the State

is provided for if such property is required for a public purpose. Thus

WRT/0007/19

Page 10 of 24

upon acquisition, the legitimacy to hold title and retain such title will

subsist if and only if such property is utilised or required for such or

other public purpose. In the absence of such, the State would not have

the legitimacy to continue to keep and retain title of such property. The

rationale and the basis of incorporating Section 39A is to enable the

divesting of acquired land in such circumstances subject to the

satisfaction of the requirements under Section 39A (2).

18. This is buttressed and confirmed by the speech made by the then

Minister, Mr. Gamini Dissanayake as he moved the Amendment to the

Land Acquisition Act, found in the Parliamentary Hansard Report, dated

04th January 1979 (page 104), which is as follows:

Under the present Land Acquisition Act it is not possible for me,

as Minister, to divest the State of the ownership of land even where

representations are made by an Hon. Member of Parliament that

the land is not being used for the purpose for which it was taken

over. There is no provision under the present law to hand the land

back to the owner or possessor of it at the time it was taken over.

So, this is a lacuna in the law which we are now trying to fill. This

is a very necessary amendment to the law; otherwise, the State

will be saddled with the ownership and possession of numerous

lands all over the country, taken over for burial grounds and co-

operative shops, which are not being used for the purpose for

which they were taken over and for which the State has no use.

And the person who has been dispossessed is rightly expecting

that he will be made the owner of that land once again (at page

104 of the Parliamentary Hansard Report, dated 04th January

1979).

19. Accordingly, when circumstances exist that such land is not required

for the immediate public purpose or any other prospective public

purpose, an obligation arises and a duty is cast upon the Minister to

WRT/0007/19

Page 11 of 24

divest the said land. This duty arises and the obligation is imposed upon

the Minister on the arising of the said non-requirement for a public

purpose. When such a duty is cast upon the Minister, a corresponding

right accrues to the original owners to have such property divested. In

these circumstances, when a discretion is vested upon the Minister

under Section 39A, that discretion ceases to be absolute and unfettered.

As held in Rajeswari Nadaraja vs. Hon. M. Najeeb Abdul Majeed and

others, SC Appeal No. 177/2015, decided on 31. 08.2018, Justice

Aluwihare, PC, held that the power and discretion to vest as well as

divest is held in trust for the public.

20. It was submitted that a mandamus will not lie where there is a

discretion. The argument was based on the English law principle of

Administrative Law pertaining to judicial review of executive action. This

principle was adopted and applied in Kingsley Fernando vs.

Dayaratne and Others [1991] 2 Sri L.R. 129, S. N. Silva, J., as he was

then in the Court of Appeal, considering Section 39A (1), opined that the

use of the word may in the statute indicates a permissive rather than

a mandatory power and that a discretion is vested in the Minister to

divest any land vested under Section 38, provided certain requirements

are met. Then it was concluded that Section 39A (1) of the Land

Acquisition Act does not grant the former owner a statutory right to

demand a divesting Order, as it merely confers discretion upon the

Minister. Accordingly, it was held that a writ of mandamus could not be

issued to compel the Minister to exercise his discretionary power. Then

in Alexander Pintuge Abeyratne vs. Minister of Lands, Ministry of

Lands Battaramulla and 6 others, (SC Appeal No.83/08 & 101/08,

decided on 01.06.2009), S. N. Silva, C.J., reiterating the above view, held

that Section 39A is not amenable to judicial review in an application for

a writ of mandamus.

21. In both the above decisions of Kingsley Fernando vs. Dayaratne and

Others as well as Alexander Pintuge Abeyratne vs. Minister of

Lands, Justice S. N. Silva applied and followed the English law principle

WRT/0007/19

Page 12 of 24

that obligatory duties are required to be distinguished from discretionary

powers, as mandamus has nothing to do with the latter and where there

is a discretion, no mandamus will lie. (Wade on Administrative Law, 8th

Ed., pg. 609). This principle may be applied in its absolute form in the

British Constitutional tradition based on the notion of Parliamentary

Sovereignty, whereas in Sri Lanka, Article 3 of the Constitution provides

that In the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the People and is

inalienable. Sovereignty includes the powers of government, fundamental

rights and franchise, providing that sovereignty is in the People. In the

Supreme Court determination In Re the Nineteenth Amendment to

the Constitution (2002) 3 Sri L.R, at page 97, it was held that, ...power

remains and continues to be reposed in the People who are sovereign, and

its exercise by the particular organ of government being its custodian for

the time being, is for the People. Thus, under the Sri Lankan

Constitution, it is the People who are sovereign and the particular organ

of government being a part of the State is merely holding the power of

the sovereign People in trust as custodian.

22. When power, be it discretionary or otherwise, so vested in public

authorities are held in public trust, it must be exercised for the purposes

for which they were granted. The legitimacy to vest and hold such land

is singularly the existence of the requirement of such land for a public

purpose. The State is not entitled to vest or retain such property if it is

not required for a public purpose. When circumstances stipulated by

Section 39A (2) are shown to exist, the Minister is then obligated and

duty bound to act under 39A (1) and make a divesting Order. This is so

as the discretion ceases with the loss of the legitimate basis to hold such

land due to the absence of the critical requirement of a public purpose,

as the State is reposed with such powers in trust and required to

exercise the same for the benefit of the People. Accordingly, I find that,

when the requirements under Section 39A (2) are shown to be present,

then, it obligates and imposes a duty on the Minister to exercise that

discretion in a particular manner.

WRT/0007/19

Page 13 of 24

23. In Silva and others vs. Minister of Lands and Land Development

and Minor Exports and others, Sriskandarajah, J., issuing a writ of

mandamus directing the 1st respondent Minister of Lands to revoke the

vesting Order under Section 39 opined that,

when the public purpose is not in existence and the authority

which had sought the acquisition has no other identified public

purpose for which it could be used it is the duty of the Minister to

revoke the vesting Order if the possession of the land has not been

taken over by the State.

Thus, with the preconditions under Section 39A (2) shown to be present,

the discretionary power of the Minister becomes an obligatory duty. If

such power under Section 39A (1) to divest is then not exercised, such

action or inaction is amenable to writ and compellable by mandamus.

24. I observe that in both decisions of Kingsley Fernando vs. Dayaratne

and Others as well as in Alexander Pintuge Abeyratne vs. Minister

of Lands and 6 others, Justice Sarath N. Silva, has failed to considered

or advert to the public trust doctrine in the above context. However, in

contrast, I find that in the decisions of De Silva vs. Atukorale, Minister

of Lands, Irrigation and Mahaweli Development and Another [1993]

1 Sri L.R. 283 and Rashid v. Rajitha Senaratne, Minister of Lands

and Others [2004] 1 Sri L.R 312, Justice Mark Fernando, considering

the discretion vested by Section 39A and adverting to the public trust

doctrine has concluded that it is amenable to and is enforceable by

mandamus. In De Silva vs. Atukorale, Minister of Lands, Irrigation

and Mahaweli Development and Another (supra), Justice Mark

Fernando considered the discretion vested by Section 39A, and whilst

acknowledging the Minister's discretionary power to divest if the

statutory conditions are met, His Lordship held that the power to divest

was deemed

a power conferred solely to be used for the public good, and not

for his personal benefit; it is held in trust for the public; to be

WRT/0007/19

Page 14 of 24

exercised reasonably and in good faith, and upon lawful and

relevant grounds of public interest.

25. In Rashid vs. Rajitha Senaratne, Minister of Lands and Others

(supra), the above principle was followed and affirmed, and held that, to

compel a divesting Order under Section 39A, the critical factor is

whether the land has been used for a public purpose after possession

was taken, and whether improvements have been made. The Minister's

failure to assert a continuing public purpose for the land or deny that

the conditions for divesting were met, especially after a prolonged period

of non-use, supported the appellant's claim for divesting; and the

appellants were granted and issued a writ of mandamus directing the

Minister to divest under Section 39A (1).

26. Similarly, in Rajeswari Nadaraja vs. Minister of Industry and

Commerce and Co-operatives Development and Others, (SC Appeal

No. 177/2015, decided on 31.08.2018), Justice Aluwihare, P.C.,

considering a similar provision under the Co-operative Societies (Special

Provisions) Act No. 35 of 1970, in relation to a Derequisition Order held

that;

The discretion vested in the Minister in this regard does not mean

that he is empowered to withhold issuing the order as he pleases.

Where circumstances warrant the law imposes a duty to

exercise that discretion in a particular manner - which in the

present case is a derequisitioning order. Where there is a failure in

this regard, that duty would be made enforceable by a

mandamus.

27. Justice Aluwihare then emphasized that statutory powers, even if

phrased with may are conferred upon trust for public purposes and

must be exercised in the "right and proper way" intended by Parliament.

Crucially, His Lordship ruled that when the factual circumstances

clearly indicate a departure from the legislative intent, the law discerns

WRT/0007/19

Page 15 of 24

a duty to exercise that discretion in a particular manner,

enforceable by mandamus.

28. I am convinced and inclined to follow De Silva vs. Atukorale, Minister

of Lands, Irrigation and Mahaweli Development and Another [1993]

1 Sri L.R. 283, Rashid vs. Rajitha Senaratne, Minister of Lands and

Others [2004] 1 Sri L.R 312, and Rajeswari Nadaraja vs. Minister of

Industry and Commerce and Co-operatives Development and

Others, [SC Appeal No. 177/2015, decided on 31.08.2018].

Objections by heirs; are heirs necessary parties?

29. The said heirs were permitted to intervene. Lets now consider if the

concerns and objections of the heirs warrant or justify the non-divesting

of the said unutilised portion of the land. The persons objecting are the

heirs of Magi Perera. Magi Perera along with the petitioner, were the

persons interested in the land at the time of the vesting. Magi Perera

died on 13.03.1986 after the vesting Order was made. The legitimate

basis or the locus of the heirs to object arises only if they have a legal

right or an interest in the said land at the point of raising such objection.

The immediate issue for determination is whether they were entitled to

any portion or part of the vested land qua heirs at the point of so

objecting. In determining this issue, the provisions of Section 39A (4)

and Section 40, are relevant. The said provisions specify the effect and

import of the vesting Order published under Section 38 and that of a

divesting Order under Section 39A (4), which reads as follows:

(4) The following provisions shall apply in any case where any land

vested in the State by a vesting Order referred to in subsection (1)

is subsequently divested by a divesting Order under the said

subsection:

(a) that land shall be deemed never to have vested in the

State by virtue of that vesting Order;

WRT/0007/19

Page 16 of 24

(b) every right, title, or interest in or over that land of a person

interested in that land existing at the time the vesting Order

was published in the Gazette shall be deemed not to have

been extinguished and every such right, title or interest shall

be valid and enforceable -notwithstanding such vesting

Order;

(c) the person or persons interested in that land at the time

the vesting Order was published in the Gazette shall

forthwith be restored to possession of the said land;

(d) all claims made under this Act to the compensation

payable in respect of that land and all proceedings taken

under this Act in relation to such claims before the divesting

Order took effect shall be deemed to be null and void;

(e) no fresh claims to compensation in respect of that land

and no claim for damages against the State, a public officer

or the Minister by any person or persons interested in that

land at the time the vesting Order was published in the

Gazette or subsequent thereto, shall be entertained or

allowed in any court or tribunal; and

(f) the preceding provisions of this section shall have effect

notwithstanding anything in any other provision of this Act

or in any other written law.

30. Section 40 reads as follows:

40. When an Order of the Minister under section 38 is published in

the Gazette, then

(a) where that Order is in regard to the taking possession of

a particular land, that land shall, by virtue of that Order,

vest absolutely in the State free from all encumbrances with

effect from the date on which that Order is so published, and

any officer who is authorized to do so by that Order may, on

or after that date, take possession of that land for and on

behalf of the State, or

WRT/0007/19

Page 17 of 24

(b) where that Order is in regard to the subjection of a

particular land to a particular servitude, that land shall be

subject to that servitude, and that servitude may be utilized

for the public purpose for which it was acquired, on and after

the aforesaid date.

31. Accordingly, when an Order is made under Section 38, the land shall

vest in the State absolutely, free from all encumbrances, with effect from

that date. Correspondingly, the original persons interested or the owners

would cease to have any right, title, or interest in the said land by virtue

of said vesting Order. Therefore, both Magi Perera as well as the

petitioner were relieved of any right, title, or interest with effect from

29.11.1982. The necessary consequence of this deprivation are that both

of them ceased to have any right, title, or interest and will not have any

such right, title, or interest until or unless a divesting Order is published

in the Gazette under Section 39A.

32. In these circumstances, at the point of the demise of Magi Perera, she

did not have any right, title, or interest or any proprietary rights of

whatever nature or ownership in respect of the corpus of this

application. That being so, when Magi Perera has nothing, the heirs

inherit nothing. Therefore, in law, until and unless a divesting Order is

made, the heirs will not have any rights inherited qua heirs of the

original owner. This is so, as Section 39A (4)(a) clearly states that upon

the divesting Order being published land shall be deemed never to have

vested in the State. This deeming provision is required as the Law does

not and cannot recognize an interval between the passing of property at

any point of time. In Welgama vs. Wijesundera (2006) 1 Sri L R 110,

this requirement of law is expounded as follows:

The Law does not and cannot recognize an interval between the

death and the passing of property, since rights and obligations,

from which perspective only, property and legal relationships are

WRT/0007/19

Page 18 of 24

identified in law, have to be, at any given point of time vested or

reposed in a person or legal entity.

33. However, nothing accrues to heirs until a divesting Order is made.

Section 39A (4) (b) provides that the right, title, or interest over the land

of the person interested that existed at the time of the vesting Order shall

be deemed not to have been extinguished. Similarly, it provides that

such right, title, or interest thereonwards, shall be revived valid and

enforceable notwithstanding the vesting Order. This puts it beyond

doubt that until and unless a divesting Order is published in the

Gazette, the heirs will have no legal entitlement of inheritance. As stated

above, upon the divesting Order being made, such persons right of

inheritance will revive in view of the deeming provisions. Thus, legally,

the prospective heirs will have no standing or a legitimate basis to object

to the divesting on the said basis.

34. The intervenient parties (now added respondents) have annexed copies

of decisions made under Section 10 (1) (a) of the Land Acquisition Act,

where the Divisional Secretary has determined the entitlements to

compensation of the heirs. On this basis, the added respondents attempt

to argue that they have an interest which enables them to object to the

divesting. The legal basis of their entitlement to compensation is that

with the vesting Order, the original owners, namely Magi Perera and the

petitioner, acquired and accrued the right to compensation. This

acquired right and entitlement to compensation remained with Magi

Perera at the point of her demise. It is this entitlement that became a

part of her estate and the heirs became entitled to. Therefore, the

entitlement to compensation does not create or support any right, title,

or interest in the land vested in the State.

35. Any rights or entitlements to the vested property may accrue and enure

to the heirs of Magi Perera only upon divesting. If such heirs desire to

pursue and vindicate their interests, the remedy is to resort to the

WRT/0007/19

Page 19 of 24

relevant civil action, to vindicate any of their rights, title, or interest.

Subject to this, there is no legal right or standing for the prospective

heirs of a deceased interested person (owner) to object to a divesting.

Correspondingly, such objection by possible heirs is not a ground that

inhibits or prevents the Minister from making a divesting Order if the

conditions stipulated by Section 39A (2) are satisfied.

36. The respondents as well as the added respondents argue that if a

portion is carved out and divested, it would cause prejudice to the heirs

who claim to be co-owners of the larger portion as well. This argument,

to my mind, is totally misconceived and has no legal basis. Even when

a portion of a larger land is divested, if there be any co-owners, each of

them would be entitled to their share on a proportionate basis from the

portion which is so carved out and divested. Therefore, there cannot be

any prejudice as alleged by the added respondents as well as the

respondents. Accordingly I hold that the heirs are not necessary parties

to this application.

Divesting of a part of the land vested.

37. It was the submission of learned Counsel for the respondents that the

divesting of a part of the land vested is not lawful and it should be the

entirety of the land covered by the vesting Order. S. N. Silva, J., in

Kingsley Fernando vs. Dayaratne and Others (supra), observed that;

Section 39A (1) empowers the Minister to divest the State of the

land so vested by the vesting order. The vesting order referred to

is that made under Section 38. It is clear from the papers filed in

the previous application that there was one vesting order in respect

of the entire extent of 12 acres. Therefore, I am inclined to agree

with the submission of Learned Counsel for the Respondents that

the divesting was to relate to the entire extent covered by the

vesting order. This view is further supported by Section 39A (4) (a)

which provides that upon a divesting order that land shall be

deemed never to have vested in the State by virtue of the vesting

WRT/0007/19

Page 20 of 24

order. Hence what is contemplated is a complete reversal of the

status quo ante and not a piece-meal divesting of particular

portions of a land that is vested.

38. As opposed to that in De Silva vs. Atukorale, Minister of Lands,

Irrigation, and Mahaweli Development and Another (supra), the

divesting was ordered in respect of a part of the original land acquired.

In the said application, a total of seven allotments of land, consisting of

19 acres, 1 rood and 23.8 perches in extent were acquired. That too, had

been co-owned land. Possession had been taken and handed over to the

Urban Development Authority. The public purpose was for the Bibile

Town Development Project. However, at a particular point of time, the

implementation of the said project had been suspended for the non-

availability of funds. Simply, it was a failure to utilise the land for the

intended public purpose. It was held that the only provision under which

the Minister could have acted is Section 39A, and to divest, provided

that the four requirements under subsection (2) were satisfied. The land

was acquired for the purpose of construction of a proposed shopping

complex. It was observed that 19 acres of land is far beyond the

requirement to satisfy this public purpose, and the Supreme Court

upheld the divesting of a part thereof. His Lordship held thus;

However, in his affidavit in the Court of Appeal, he sought to

justify his inaction on the different, but patently erroneous, basis

that the land was required for a shopping Complex ignorant or

forgetful of the fact that the land was over 19 acres in extent while

the complex required only about 3% of that extent; a manifestly

erroneous basis for his refusal to exercise his discretion. The

affidavits and documents produced, show, beyond doubt, that

had the matter been considered properly, the 1st respondent

had no option but to make a divesting order, retaining only

the land actually required for the shopping complex, subject

to compliance with section 39A (2) (d). (emphasis added)

WRT/0007/19

Page 21 of 24

39. Accordingly, there are two lines of authority. As aforestated, Justice

S.N. Silva in Kingsley Fernando vs. Dayaratne and Others has not

considered the public trust doctrine, whereas, Justice Mark Fernando

in De Silva vs. Atukorale, Minister of Lands, Irrigation, and

Mahaweli Development and Another having considered the same, has

made a specific Order to divest a portion of the land originally vested. In

fact, when it was opined that the 1st respondent had no option but to

make a divesting order, retaining only the land actually required for the

shopping complex, subject to compliance with section 39A (2) (d), it

simply is that divesting of an unutilised portion is not only lawful but is

mandatory. This is a necessary consequence arising from the loss of the

basis of legitimacy due to the failure to utilise such vested land for a

public purpose. This is exactly what Justice Mark Fernando opined.

40. Section 39A (1) does specifically refer to such land. However, when this

is considered in conjunction with the public trust doctrine and the above

dicta, if such land or a portion thereof is not utilised and not required

for any public purpose, by operation of these legal principles the State

loses its legitimate basis to hold and retain such unutilised portion and

the State is then obligated and mandated to divest such portion or part

thereof which remains so unutilised. Accordingly, it should necessarily

follow that such land in Section 39A(1) necessarily means and includes

the divesting the entirety or such unutilised part or portion thereof. Any

other interpretation would lead to the absurdity of the State having to

hold and retain a parcel of land which the State is not legitimately

entitled to retain. Correspondingly, this will deprive the legitimate right

of the original owner to effectively obtain his lawful entitlement by

divesting of such parcel of land that remains so unutilised. Accordingly,

I hold that the divesting of a part of the land is lawful and possible.

Consent in writing to take possession [Section 39A(2)(d)].

41. Section 39A (1) of the Land Acquisition Act empowers the Minister to

divest any land that has vested upon an Order under Section 38 and

WRT/0007/19

Page 22 of 24

when possession has been taken under Section 40 (a) on behalf of the

State. However this is subject to the conditions stipulated in paragraphs

(a) to (d) of Section 39A (2) namely: (a) no compensation has been paid;

(b) the said land has not been used for a public purpose; (c) no

improvements to the said land have been effected; and (d) the person or

persons interested in the said land have consented in writing to take

possession of such land immediately after the divesting Order is

published in the Gazette.

42. It was submitted that the written consent stipulated by Section 39A

(2) (d) to take possession of such land is not provided in that form. Lets

now consider the basis and rationale of requiring the consent in writing

to take possession immediately after a divesting Order is published in

the Gazette. Divesting under Section 39A arises only if possession of the

land has been taken over by the State. In these circumstances, with the

divesting Order being published the possession held by the State, will

also come to an end and unless an interested person takes possession,

it would lead to a situation of the land being in a state of limbo, not being

in the possession of any person. It is to ensure that the possession is

returned and handed over to the interested persons and thereby revert

to the status quo ante immediately preceding the vesting Order that such

a provision was so required. This is further confirmed by Section 39A (4)

(c) where it provides that the person or persons interested in the land,

at the time the vesting Order was made and published, to forthwith be

restored to possession.

43. On a perusal of the petition I observe that the petitioner, by letter dated

10.04.2011 (P-11), has made a request for the divesting of 9.25 perches.

Then the petitioner has also tendered the affidavit P-16 to the

respondents by which, at paragraph 7 thereof, the petitioner specifically

informs as follows:

WRT/0007/19

Page 23 of 24

,

, 9.25

.

This clearly is an expression of the consent to take possession. According

to paragraph 44 of the petition, this affidavit has been submitted to the

6th respondent Divisional Secretary. This satisfies the condition

stipulated by Section 39A (2) (d).

Conclusion

44. In the above circumstances, it is common ground that Lot No. 2

depicted in Plan No. 1706B is a defined and demarcated portion of land,

that which was originally vested. It is also not in dispute that the said

Lot No. 2 remains unutilised and is no longer required for any public

purpose. Similarly, all other requirements specified by Section 39A (2)

are also satisfied. Accordingly, the petitioner is entitled as of right, and

the 1st respondent Minister is under an obligation and duty to make a

divesting Order under Section 39A (1).

45. In the above premises, I hold that the petitioner is entitled to a writ of

mandamus directing the 1st respondent and his successors in office to

revoke the vesting Order made and published in the Extraordinary

Gazette bearing No. 221/3, dated 29.11.1982, in respect of Lot No. 2 of

Plan No. 1706B prepared by P. Wickremasinghe, Licensed Surveyor,

being 9.25 perches. Further, the petitioner is entitled to a writ of

certiorari to quash the purported revocation of the recommendation,

depicted in letter dated 23.11.2016 of the 3rd respondent. Accordingly I

hold that the petitioner is entitled to relief sought by prayers (c) and (d).

46. Accordingly,

(i) a writ of certiorari is hereby issued quashing the decision reflected

in the letter addressed to the 1st respondent dated 23.11.2016,

by the 3rd respondent to revoke the original recommendation and

the request to divest the said land defined, demarcated, and

WRT/0007/19

Page 24 of 24

depicted as Lot No. 02 in Plan No. 1706B, prepared by P.

Wickremasinghe, Licensed Surveyor, being 9.25 perches; and

(ii) a writ of mandamus is hereby issued directing the 1st respondent

to issue a divesting Order under Section 39A (1) of the Land

Acquisition Act in respect of the portion of land defined,

demarcated, and depicted as Lot No. 02 in Plan No. 1706B,

prepared by P. Wickremasinghe, Licensed Surveyor, being 9.25

perches.

47. Application is allowed to that extent, however no order is made as to

costs.
