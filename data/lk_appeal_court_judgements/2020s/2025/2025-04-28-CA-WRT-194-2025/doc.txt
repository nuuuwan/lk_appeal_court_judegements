Before: M. T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J (President C/A)- Acting. K. P. FERNANDO, J. Counsel: Amila Palliyage with Sandeepani Wijesooriya, Savani Udugarapola,

Lakitha Wakishta Arachchi and Subaj De Silva for the Petitioner. S. Herath, DSG for the Respondents. Supported on: 28. 03. 2025 Decided on: 28. 04. 2025 MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. (President of The Court of Appeal- Acting)

The Petitioner is seeking, inter alia, a Writ of Certiorari to quash the report dated

06.03.2025, filed by the ASP under the Offences Against Public Property Act No. 12 of

1982 (as amended), in the Magistrates Court of Mahara in case bearing No. B/516/2016,

filed against the Petitioner.

Additionally, the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Prohibition, prohibiting the Officer-in-

Charge of the Criminal Investigation Department from arresting the Petitioner in relation

to the aforementioned case, and a Writ of Mandamus, directing the learned Magistrate of

Mahara to consider granting bail to the Petitioner. The Petitioner is also seeking an interim

order preventing the Respondents from arresting the Petitioner.

On 28.03.2025, we heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioner in support of this

application, and thereafter, we heard the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the

Respondents.

A complaint was made to the 1st Respondent regarding a fraud allegedly committed by

former Minister Mervyn Silva, involving the execution of a deed of sale in respect of a

state land situated in Kiribathgoda. When it was revealed to the 1st and 2nd Respondents

that the Petitioner was also involved in the alleged fraud in his capacity as Chairman of the

Page 3 of 5

Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha, the ASP filed a B Report in the Magistrates Court of Mahara

under the provisions of the aforementioned Act.

The Petitioner contends that he had no involvement whatsoever in the execution of the said

fraudulent deed. In contrast, the 1st and 2nd Respondents contend that, in his capacity as

Chairman of the Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha, the Petitioner knowingly and deliberately

approved unauthorized constructions on the said state land.

In order to substantiate the contentions of the 1st and 2nd Respondents, the learned Deputy

Solicitor General tendered certain confidential documents to this Court.

At the outset, the attention of this Court is drawn to the affidavit filed by the Police Officer

No. 35078, who is in charge of the case pending before the Magistrates Court of Mahara.

In the said affidavit, it is stated that the Petitioner, in his capacity as Chairman, forcibly

removed all files pertaining to the unauthorized constructions on the land in dispute.

Furthermore, it is alleged that the approval and the assessment numbers for the said

unauthorized constructions were personally granted by the Petitioner, with full knowledge

of the aforesaid illegal transfer.

Having perused the confidential documents submitted by the State, it is, ex facie,

established that there exists a prima facie case against the Petitioner, indicating his

involvement in the alleged fraudulent transaction.

Subsequently, the Petitioner became a Member of Parliament, a position in which he

participated in the enactment of laws for the country. As such, he is expected to have a

thorough understanding of the law and to exhibit a heightened sense of responsibility in

adhering to it. Unlike an ordinary citizen, the Petitioner holds, or has held, a position of

authority and trust, and it is therefore incumbent upon him to demonstrate a greater

awareness of the law and a stronger commitment to upholding the rule of law.

The Petitioner must be reminded that no individual, regardless of their social or political

status, is above the law. He is equally subject to the rule of law, and any legal process must

be respected and followed.

There is no legal impediment preventing the Petitioner from appearing before the learned

Magistrate and stating his innocence. If, upon examination, there is insufficient evidence

to substantiate the allegations made against him, the Magistrate is well within the law to

consider granting bail.

It is also imperative that the Petitioner understands his duty to cooperate fully with the

ongoing investigation. Assisting the police officers in conducting a fair and impartial

investigation is not only a legal obligation but also a moral one, especially for a person

who has served in a legislative capacity. Such cooperation ensures that the process of

justice is upheld and that the integrity of the legal system is maintained.

In the case of Jayaweera v Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura1 it

was observed by Jayasuriya, J, as follows;

a petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a writ of

Certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a

matter of routine, even if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has a discretion to

deny his relief having regard to his conduct, delay, laches, waiver, submission to

jurisdiction, - are all valid impediments which stand against the right of relief.

In the instant application, if this Court grants the reliefs as prayed for, I am of the view that

such an order would amount to an unwarranted interference with the ongoing investigation

being conducted by the 1st and 2nd Respondents. Furthermore, it would also constitute an

intrusion into the powers and functions of the learned Magistrate of Mahara, who is duly

empowered by law to inquire into this matter.

Moreover, it is settled law that this Court will not exercise writ jurisdiction where an

alternative remedy is available to the Petitioner under the law. Admittedly, the Petitioner

has the right to appear before the learned Magistrate and, upon establishing his innocence,

seeks bail. If bail is refused, he is entitled to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of the High

Court for the same relief. Without first availing himself of these alternative remedies, the

Petitioner is not entitled to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court.

It is transpired that the Petitioner has not cooperated with the 1st and 2nd Respondents by

providing statements and not appeared before the learned Magistrate and has absconded.

Before he complains to this court, he must first comply with the order of the learned

Magistrate to appear before court and to give statements to the 1st and 2nd respondents.

Having scrutinised the petition, affidavit and all other supporting documents filed by the

Petitioner, the confidential documents tendered by the state, the submissions of the learned

counsel for the petitioner and the learned DSG for the Respondents. It appears that there

is no necessity arises for this Court to interfere with the judicial process of the learned

magistrate and the investigation process of the Respondents by way of judicial review.

Thus, the notices are refused and the application is dismissed, no costs.

Proceedings are terminated.
