Factual matrix of the application

The Petitioners in the instant application are all either owners or residents of the premises situated at Layards Road, Colombo 5, where the subject premises bearing no. 15A is also situated at. The Petitioners state that from latter part of 2016, the 3rd Respondent was pursuing the construction of a high-rise building at the subject premises in contravention of the applicable building regulations including the City of Colombo Development Plan (Amendment) 2008.

The 1st to 6th petitioners together with several other residents of Layards Road filed an application bearing no. CA (Writ) 194/2017 in the Court of Appeal seeking a Writ of Certiorari quashing any preliminary planning clearance or any other document issued in respect of the subject premises and a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting any further planning clearance or building permit being issued in respect of the subject premises. However, pending said application, the 3rd Respondent obtained the Development Permit (A3) dated 28.12.2017 for the construction of 14 storied high-rise building on the subject premises.

The Petitioners state that the Petitioners have come to know that the 1st Respondent has issued the above permit A3 when it lacked power i.e. either delegated or otherwise, to issue the same and with an ulterior motive and mala fides. Further, the 1st Respondent had submitted (in its limited objections filed in CA (Writ) 194/ 2017) a document different to

Page 4 of 8

the permit A3 claiming that such document (A13) is the Development Permit issued to the 3rd Respondent. Accordingly, the Petitioners claim that the purported Development Permit A3 is invalid, void in law, arbitrary, fraudulent and is ultra vires.

While Permit A3 bears the no. 16789 and sets out the date of the 3rd Respondents building application (A12) as 01.02.2017, the Permit marked A13 bears a different and subsequent no. i.e. 16791 and a different date as the date of the building application i.e.30.01.2017. It is submitted that such contention of the Respondents gives rise to a legitimate suspicion in relation to the authenticity and reliability of the document and the bona fide intentions of the 1st and the 2nd Respondents.

The Petitioners further state that the 1st Respondent claims that the purported Development Permit A3 has been issued under the power delegated to the 1st Respondent by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) in terms of Section 23(5) of the Urban Development Authority Law (UDA Law). However, it is submitted that the 1st Respondent did not in the first instance have any authority or power whatsoever to issue the said Development Permit A3 as per the communication dated 23.01.2017 (A10) by which the UDA recalled the authority delegated to the 1st Respondent with effect from 01.02.2017. The building application A12 has been submitted to the 1st Respondent only on 01.02.2017. The necessary charges/fees in respect of the said building application have been paid on 01.02.2017. It is submitted that even if the building application A12 was physically submitted to the 1st Respondent prior to 01.02.2017 as per the communication A10, the 1st Respondent had no authority to charge fees in respect of building application A12. Consequently, the Petitioners argued that the Development Permit A13 too is invalid, void in law, arbitrary, fraudulent and is ultra vires.

Accordingly, in the instant application, the Petitioners seek inter alia Writs of Certiorari quashing the purported Development Permits A3 and A13 and the Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 1st and the 2nd Respondents from accepting any building applications and/or processing such applications and /or issuing any building permit/approval.

The 1st and the 2nd Respondents state that the 1st Respondent received the building application dated 23.01.2017 (1R1) from the 3rd Respondent

Page 5 of 8

on 30.01.2017. The processing fee of the said building application was calculated on 30.01.2017 but has been paid on the 01.02.2017. By a communication dated 23.01.2017, the UDA has informed the 1st Respondent that the powers have been delegated to the 1st Respondent by the UDA for, inter alia, the acceptance of building applications, the processing of such applications and charging the relevant fees and the issuance of Development Permits in respect of certain types of developments have been withdrawn and recalled to the UDA with effect from 01.02.2017. However, such withdrawal applied only to the building applications that were submitted after 01.02. 2017. Accordingly, the 1st Respondent claim that it continued to process the above building application 1R1 which was received on 30.01.2017.

The aforesaid building application 1R1 had been considered by the planning committee of the 1st Respondent Council at their meeting held on 21.12.2017 and decided to grant a Development Permit to the 3rd Respondent based on such application. The Development Permit has been made in four copies and each of the said copies has distinct and consecutive running numbers. One such copy is released to the developer, i.e. 3rd Respondent, another copy is sent to the UDA and the third copy is sent to the Assessors Department of the 1st Respondent Council and the fourth copy is retained by the City Planning Division of the 1st Respondent Council. The documents marked A3 and A13 are one of each such copies issued in respect of premises at No. 15 A, Layards Road, Colombo 5. The date 01.02.2017 which appears on document A3 as the date on which the application was handed over to the 1st Respondent, is a typographical error made when preparing the Development Permit which was subsequently corrected. Hence, it is claimed that the typographical error in A3 and the different numbers in A3(16789) and A13 (16791) is not a consequence of any fraudulent activity. Accordingly, the Respondents move that the application of the Petitioners be dismissed.

On 16.11.2023 all parties agreed to dispose this application by way of written submissions. Although the parties initially agreed to abide by the judgement to be delivered in the case bearing no. CA(Writ) 194/2017, subsequently the parties requested for a separate judgement.

Authority of the Respondents to issue Development Permits

Page 6 of 8

The Petitioners submit that such authority to accept, charge fees for and to process building applications and issue and extend Development Permits in respect of constructions including constructions that are over four floors and 4000 sq. ft. and premises in extent over 40 perches had been withdrawn from the 1st Respondent with effect from 01.02.2017 by the UDA as per the communication dated 23.01.2017 (A10). The Petitioners contend that as per the building application (A12), such application had been submitted to the 1st Respondent by the 3rd Respondent on 01.02.2017 and the approval for the same had been granted on 28.12.2017. Furthermore, the payment relating to the building application had been made on 01.02.2017. The Development Permit (A3) was issued by the 1st Respondent on 28.12.2017 pursuant to a meeting of the planning committee held on 21.12.2017. Accordingly, the Petitioners argued that the issuance of the Development Permit (A3) is ultra vires as it was issued after the withdrawal of authority delegated to the 1st Respondent by the UDA.

However, the aforesaid withdrawal of the delegated authority by the UDA by its communication dated 23.01.2017(A10) applies with effect from 01.02.2017. As revealed by the Petitioner, the facts and matters relating to the instant application are almost identical to that of the facts involved in Court of Appeal Case No. CA (Writ) 194/2017. I had the benefit of delivering the judgement in the said matter as well. In determining the matters related to said Case No. CA (Writ) 194/2017, it was brought to my attention that the UDA had issued the further communication dated 22.02.2017 (marked as 3R2d by the Respondents in the above case) whereby UDA has authorised the 1st and the 2nd Respondents to process the applications that had been received by the 1st and the 2nd Respondent prior to 01.02.2017. I see no legal impediment to taking judicial notice of the said communication which forms part and parcel of case No. CA (Writ) 194/2017, in view of the facts and circumstances in relation to this matter are almost identical to that of case no. CA (Writ) 194/2017. In view of the said communication dated 22.02.2017 issued by UDA, the 1st and the 2nd Respondents were authorized to process the applications that had been received by the 1st and the 2nd Respondents prior to 01.02.2017. Accordingly, the stance taken up by the Petitioners that the building applications received prior to 01.02.2017 cannot be processed by the 1st Respondent cannot sustain.

Page 7 of 8

A copy of the said building application marked (A12) has been submitted for the perusal of this Court. As per the day stamp of the Planning Division of the 1st Respondent on the said building application (A12), it is observed that the said application had been submitted on 30.01.2017. Further, the endorsement dated 30.01.2017 made on the application (A12) concerning the calculation of the processing fee also supports the fact that the application was submitted on 30.01.2017. Accordingly, I am of the view that the application (A12) had been received by the 1st Respondent before 01.02.2017 and the Respondents were authorized to process such building application as per communication A10. Additionally, it appears that the contested Development Permit is not the only permit issued regarding a building application received by the 1st Respondent before 01.02.2017 but processed afterwards. In support of that the Respondents have submitted other building applications (1R3,1R4) which the 1st Respondent received prior to 01,02.2017 but processed after 01.02.2017.

Discrepancies in the Development Permits

The Petitioners have submitted Development Permits purported to be the same but have different serial numbers and dates on which the building application was submitted, indicating that the Respondents were fabricating and forging documentation. The Petitioners brought to the attention of this Court, that the Development Permit bearing serial no.16789 (A3) on which the building application was submitted, bears the date 01.02.2017 while the Permit bearing no.16791(A13) bears the date 30.01.2017. The Respondent clarified that the date 01.02.2017 which appears on the document A3 is the date on which the building application was submitted and that due to a typographical error, which was later corrected, other copies of the same document (including A3) bear the date 30.01.2017. It is further submitted that the Development Permit was made available in four copies with distinct and consecutive numbers which were released to the Developer (3rd Respondent), UDA, Assessor Department of 1st Respondent and the City Planning Division of the 1st Respondent. It is observed that all such copies of the Development Permit bear the same reference number as ME/PB/J/BA/11/17.

It is observed that the position of the Petitioners that the Respondents have committed fraud in issuing the said Development Permit appears to be an assumption made by the Petitioners. It is also observed that the

Page 8 of 8

Petitioners have failed to substantiate their said position. As such, under the above circumstances and with the materials made available, this Court is not in a position to accept the stance of the Petitioners, which appears to be a mere conjecture.

Conclusion

I am of the view that the Petitioners have failed to satisfy this Court of any illegality or irrationality or ultra vires action on the part of the Respondent which warrants this Court to quash the Development Permits marked A3 and A13. In view of the reasons given, I am not inclined to grant any of the reliefs prayed for in the prayer to the Petition. Accordingly, the application is dismissed. I order no cost.

Application dismissed.
