However, such withdrawal applied only to the building applications that were submitted after 01.02. 2017.

The Development Permit has been made in four copies and each of the said copies has distinct and consecutive running numbers. One such copy is released to the developer, i.e. 3rd Respondent, another copy is sent to the UDA and the third copy is sent to the Assessors Department of the 1st Respondent Council and the fourth copy is retained by the City Planning Division of the 1st Respondent Council. The documents marked A3 and A13 are one of each such copies issued in respect of premises at No. 15 A, Layards Road, Colombo 5. The date 01.02.2017 which appears on document A3 as the date on which the application was handed over to the 1st Respondent, is a typographical error made when preparing the Development Permit which was subsequently corrected. Hence, it is claimed that the typographical error in A3 and the different numbers in A3(16789) and A13 (16791) is not a consequence of any fraudulent activity. Accordingly, the Respondents move that the application of the Petitioners be dismissed.",

Furthermore, the payment relating to the building application had been made on 01.02.2017.

I had the benefit of delivering the judgement in the said matter as well. In determining the matters related to said Case No. CA (Writ) 194/2017, it was brought to my attention that the UDA had issued the further communication dated 22.02.2017 (marked as 3R2d by the Respondents in the above case) whereby UDA has authorised the 1st and the 2nd Respondents to process the applications that had been received by the 1st and the 2nd Respondent prior to 01.02.2017. I see no legal impediment to taking judicial notice of the said communication which forms part and parcel of case No. CA (Writ) 194/2017, in view of the facts and circumstances in relation to this matter are almost identical to that of case no.

Further, the endorsement dated 30.01.2017 made on the application (A12) concerning the calculation of the processing fee also supports the fact that the application was submitted on 30.01.2017. Accordingly, I am of the view that the application (A12) had been received by the 1st Respondent before 01.02.2017 and the Respondents were authorized to process such building application as per communication A10.

In support of that the Respondents have submitted other building applications (1R3,1R4) which the 1st Respondent received prior to 01,02.2017 but processed after 01.02.2017.",
