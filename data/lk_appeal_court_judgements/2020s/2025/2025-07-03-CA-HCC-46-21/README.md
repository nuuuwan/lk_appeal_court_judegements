JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as 'the Accused') was indicted before the

High Court of Ratnapura alongside an individual named Farhan, who was subsequently

acquitted after the prosecution's evidence was evaluated. The charge pertained to the

alleged grave sexual abuse of Govinda Sami Kaniamma, an offence punishable under

Section 365B(2) of the Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 22 of 1995."

The Prosecution presented its case through the testimony of six witnesses and by

producing documents marked P1 to P2. In his defence, the Accused opted to make a dock

statement. Upon conclusion of the trial, by judgment dated 1st April 2021, the Learned

Trial Judge found the Accused guilty of the charge and imposed a sentence of twelve years

rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs. 20,000/-. Additionally, the Accused was

ordered to pay Rs. 200,000/- as compensation to the Victim.

Being aggrieved by the afore-mentioned conviction and sentence, the Accused has

preferred this application to this Court.

1. 1.Credibility of the witness Kaniamma (PW01)

2. Gross discrepancy as to where the incident took place

3. 3.The purported incident could not have taken place inside the Gold shop

4. 4.Delay in making the Complaint.

5. No, force , threat or intimidation or fear of death or hurt was used and she was not

in lawful detention.

6. No evidence whatsoever to suggest that PW01 was subject to the said purported

gross indecency.

7. Dock statement of the Accused-Appellant was not considered in light of the

attended circumstances.

In addition to the foregoing, it was contended that there had been an undue delay in filing

the indictment, which the court failed to take into account when determining the sentence

imposed on the Accused.

Before proceeding to examine the prosecution's case, it is essential to first consider the

judicial approach adopted by our Courts in evaluating the testimony of child witnesses

who have been subjected to sexual harassment.

With regard to the belatedness of making a complaint to the police

Sarath Menikpura v. Attorney General, CA/HCC/61/20, Decided On 27.06.2024, Wickum

A. Kalurachchi, J held that;

Delay in making a complaint about an offence committed against a child is different. In

the case at hand, the victim girl kept silent without informing anybody about the rape or

sexual harassment committed by her farther for three and a half years. A childs reason

for silence has been explained in the Crown Court Compendium Part I (published in May

2016 - page 10-22), as follows:

Experience has shown that children mau not speak out about something that has

happened to them for a number of reasons. A child may

be confused about what has happened or about whether or not to speak out;

blame him/ herself for what has happened or be afraid that he/ she will be blamed

for it and punished;

be afraid of the consequences of speaking about it, either for him/herself and/ or

for another member of the family;

may feel that s/ he may not be believed;

may have been told to say nothing and threatened with the consequences of doing

so;

may be embarrassed because s/he did not appreciate at the time that what was

happening was wrong, or because s/he enjoyed some of the aspects of the attention

they were getting;

simply blank what happened out and get on with their lives until the point comes

when they feel ready or the need to speak out {e.g. for the sake of a younger child

who s/ he feels may be at risk?;

may feel conflicted: loving the abuser but hating the abuse."

Page 5 of 11

In addition, in, The Crown Court Bench Book (published in March 2010 - at page 367) it

is stated as follows:

"Children do not have the same life experience as adults. They do not have the same

standards of logic and consistency, and their understanding may be severely limited for a

number of reasons, such as their age and immaturity. Life viewed through the eyes and

mind of a child may seem very different from life viewed by an adult. Children may not

fully understand what it is that they are describing, and they may not have the words to

describe it. They may, however, have come to realise that what they are describing is, by

adult standards, bad or, in their perception, naughty."

With regard to the corroboration

Sisira De Abrew, J. in CA/129/2002, decided on 28.06.2007, Appellate Court Judgments

(Unreported) 2007 Volume I, and held that

Court can, however act on uncorroborated testimony of a prosecutrix if her

evidence appears to the Court to be completely, satisfactory and there are

attending circumstances which make it safe for the Court to act upon her evidence

without corroboration. If I may put it in another way that is if her evidence is

capable of convincing the Court that she is speaking the truth, Court can act on

such testimony without corroboration. In this regard, I am guided by the judgment

of Justice Alles with whom Justice Weeramanthry and Justice Thamodaram

agreed in Premasiri vs. Queen 77 NLR page 86. Justice Alles stated thus: In a

charge of rape it is proper for a jury to convict on an uncorroborated evidence of

the complainant only when such evidence is of such character as to convince the

jury that she is speaking the truth.

In Dingiribandage Sumanadasa v. The Republic of Sri Lanka, CA No147/2005, Decided

on 18.07.2008, Sisira de Abrew, J. Appellate Court Judgment(Unreported) 2008 (Volume

II) Cri.

I hold that the medical evidence does not support the evidence of the prosecutrix.

Thus the case depends only on the evidence of the prosecutrix. Can an accused

person in a case of rape be convicted on uncorroborated evidence of the victim? In

this connection I would like to consider certain judicial decisions.

Page 6 of 11

In Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai Vs. State of Gujarat (2983) AIR S.C. 753 Indian Supreme

Court stated thus:-

"In the Indian setting, refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual

assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding insult to injury".

However, in Gurcharan Singh vs. State of Haryana AIR 1972 S.C. 2661 the Indian

Supreme Court held thus;

" As a rule of prudence, however, court normally looks jor some

corroboration on her testimony so as to satisfy its conscience that she is

telling the truth and that the person accused of rape on her has not been

falsely implicated".

In King vs. Athukorale 50 NLR 256 Justice Gratiaen states thus:-

"Where an accused is charged with rape, corroboration of the story of the

prosecutrix must come from some independent quarter and not from the

prosecutrix herself. A complaint made by the prosecutrix to the Police in

which she implicated the accused cannot be regarded as corroboration of

her evidence".

The facts and circumstances of the case are as follows:

According to the testimony of PW1, who was 14 years old at the time of the incident on

4th August 2025, she visited the Kalawana Hospital at approximately 11:30 hours to

obtain medication. As she was unable to obtain a registration number, she was instructed

to remain at the hospital until 14:00 hours. Upon exiting the hospital premises, she

noticed two individuals following her. In response, she proceeded to a nearby gold

jewellery shop owned by Kamaraj, who is the accused in this case, a friend of her brother.

PW1 informed the accused of her concerns, and he advised her to remain inside the shop.

While she was inside, she observed the same two individuals walking past. Subsequently,

the Accused escorted her into an inner room of the jewellery shop.

While she was inside the inner room of the jewellery shop, the Accused allegedly pushed

her against the wall, unzipped his trousers, and subjected her to inappropriate physical

contact, pressing himself against her for approximately 30 minutes. During this period,

Page 7 of 11

PW1 experienced marked physical discomfort. Thereafter, the Accused directed her to

dress and leave the room.

PW1 then returned to the front area of the shop where she had been previously seated.

She subsequently proceeded to a nearby wade shop and sat down. While there, she

recalled that she had left her umbrella at the jewellery shop and returned briefly to

retrieve it. She remained at the wade shop for approximately one hour.

Later, a person by the name of Narayana arrived. PW1 informed him that she was feeling

unwell and requested to be taken to the residence of Pushparani. Narayana complied and

escorted her to Pushparanis house.

On the following day, PW1s brother arrived and took her to his residence. Initially, PW1

did not disclose the incident to her sister-in-law; however, she recounted the events the

next day. PW1 stated that she had been visibly distressedcrying, feeling faint, and

experiencing headaches. When her sister-in-law inquired about her condition, PW1

narrated the sequence of events that had taken place at the Accuseds shop.

Thereafter, the sister-in-law informed PW1s brother, and both accompanied her to the

Kalawana Police Station on 7th August 2025. A formal police entry was made, and a

statement was recorded from PW1.

Following the lodging of the complaint, PW1 was escorted by police officers to the

Kalawana Hospital for a medical examination. She was subsequently referred to the

Ratnapura Hospital for further medical examination.

During cross-examination, it emerged that, in her police statement dated 22nd August

2005, PW1 had described the location of the incident as a "jewellery shop." However, she

also indicated that the incident occurred inside a room within the gold jewellery shop. The

learned Counsel for the Accused emphasized this inconsistency, asserting that there was

a significant discrepancy regarding the exact location where the alleged incident took

place.

According to the testimony of the witness, the incident took place in a rear section of the

jewellery shop, which was said to contain a room. However, when police officers later

visited the location, no such room was found at the rear of the gold jewellery shop. It was

noted, however, that there was a room adjoining the shop.

Page 8 of 11

It is important to recognize that both shops were located adjacent to one another. The

Accused, in his evidence, stated that the prosecution witness had initially been inside the

adjoining shop, and that he subsequently emerged with her before both entered the

jewellery shop. Notably, the adjoining shop was found to contain a small room at its rear.

The police, accompanied by Kanniamma, visited the site on three separate occasions. The

Accused did not contest the claim that the witness had entered the jewellery shop. In fact,

the witness herself stated that she had first entered the jewellery shop, following which

the Accused came out with her and then led her back inside.

Moreover, it is relevant to note that the witness had entered the shop seeking refuge from

two individuals who had been following her. At the time she gave her police statement,

she was a 14-year-old girl.

While there may be discrepancies in the description of the exact location such as referring

to the premises as a toy shop versus a jewellery shop the fact remains that the adjoining

premises contained a small room. It is well established in our jurisprudence that even

truthful witnesses may differ in minor, incidental details due to varying powers of

observation and the passage of time.

It is acknowledged that the particular jewellery shop did not have a room at its rear.

However, this inconsistency does not strike at the root of the prosecutions case. Our

Courts have consistently held that contradictions will only render evidence unreliable if

they materially affect the prosecution's case.

I am mindful of the observation made by Lord Roche in Bhojraj v. Sita Ram, 1936 AIR,

page 60 where he held that;

Evidence substantially true not infrequently assumes too perfect a form and witnesses

such as children not infrequently get a story by heart which is none the less a true story.

The real tests are : how consistent the story is with itself, how it stands the test of cross-

examination and how far it fits in with the rest of the evidence and the circumstances of

the case.

Page 9 of 11

This dictum was considered by Ranjith Silva, J in Renuka Subasinghe v. Attorney

General, 2007 (1) SLR 224.

Upon careful consideration, we observe that apart from this minor discrepancy, the

testimony of PW1 remained consistent throughout her account of the incident. Her

evidence withstood cross-examination and was not discredited. Furthermore, she

provided a reasonable explanation for the delay in lodging her complaint. We further

observed that her evidence was consistent.

The Learned High Court Judge was justified in rejecting the dock statement of the

Accused, as it did not possess sufficient evidential weight to raise a reasonable doubt. The

Court rightly observed that the Accused failed to cast any doubt on the highly

incriminating evidence presented against him.

It is well established that, throughout the course of a criminal trial, the presumption of

innocence remains in favour of the Accused, and the burden of proof rests squarely on the

Prosecution. However, once the Prosecution adduces evidence that is prima facie

incriminating, a corresponding duty arises on the part of the Accused to offer a credible

explanation or defence to rebut the inference of guilt.

We hold that the learned high court judge correctly rejected the evidence of the accused.

Upon a careful examination of the evidence and the testimony of the prosecutrix, certain

contradictions were noted. However, the Learned Trial Judge has duly considered these

discrepancies in the course of arriving at his decision. In our view, the identified

contradiction does not go to the root of the case, nor does it give rise to a reasonable doubt

in favour of the Appellant.

Accordingly, we are of the considered opinion that there is no justifiable basis to discredit

or disregard the testimony of PW1.

Therefore, we affirm the conviction.

In relation to sentencing, it is true that the incident occurred on 4th August 2005, while

the indictment was filed only on 7th March 2018, and the judgment was delivered on 1st

April 2021. The Accused endured the burden of a pending criminal charge for over a

Page 10 of 11

decade. This prolonged delay is a significant factor that cannot be overlooked in

considering the overall fairness of sentencing.

With regard to sentencing, it is acknowledged that the incident occurred on 4th August

2005, while the indictment was not filed until 7th March 2018, that is, after nearly 13

years, and the judgment was ultimately delivered on 1st April 2021. This appeal came up

on 08.12.2021. Finally, on 21.05.2025 argument concluded and judgment reserved for

03.07.2025. As discussed above, we have affirmed the conviction. The question is whether

the sentence imposed by the learned high court judge could be suspended.

The following judicial decision has recognised that undue delay may be a mitigating factor

concerning the sentence imposed.

Rajaratnam J in K.R. Karunaratne, v. The State, 78 NLR 413 held that;

This appeal came up in May 1973 for the first time when learned Counsel for the State

moved for the appeal to stand out. In February 1974 when the appeal was listed a second

time the Senior State Counsel appearing for the prosecution stated to Court that he had

not been furnished with the brief in this case and the case was again re-listed but was not

reached. The 4th date of listing, I find, is the only occasion on which the postponement

was due to the appellant and that was when his counsel fell ill. On the 5th and the 6th

occasions the appeal was not heard due to no application made on behalf of the appellant.

At this stage, therefore, the delay of 10 years to finally conclude this matter is, in my view

a very relevant circumstance to be taken into consideration before allowing the sentence

of 2 years imprisonment to operate immediately. I am not aware of any case where an

accused person has been kept in suspense for so long a period due to no fault of his own.

The accused has always been present in Court and ready to receive justice at the hands

of the Court. He has made no contribution to the delay.

In the present case, there was a delay exceeding thirteen years in filing the indictment, a delay

for which the Accused bears no responsibility. We are of the view that such an inordinate lapse

of time is sufficient to warrant interference with the sentence imposed by the Learned Trial

Judge, along with in terms of Section 333 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 25 of

2024.

6. Section 333 of the principal enactment is hereby amended in subsection (5)

thereof, by the substitution for the words "received into prison under the

sentence.", of the following:-

"received into prison under the sentence:

Provided that, the Court of Appeal may, in appropriate cases, order that the time

spent by an appellant in custody pending the determination of his appeal and any

time spent in custody prior to the conviction, such time not having been considered

as part of his sentence passed at the time of his conviction by the court of first

instance, be considered as part of his sentence ordered at the conclusion of his

appeal.".

In the present case, the Accused-Appellant has served a period of four years of imprisonment

following his conviction.

Accordingly, the sentence of twelve years rigorous imprisonment imposed by the Learned

High Court Judge is hereby set aside and substituted with a sentence of two years rigorous

imprisonment, suspended for ten years from the date of the judgment of the High Court of

Ratnapura (01.04.2021). The fine, compensation, and the default term imposed by the Trial

Judge are affirmed.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the High Court of

Ratnapura for necessary compliance.
