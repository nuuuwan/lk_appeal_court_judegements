JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Petitioners instituted this application by petition dated 29.08.2023 seeking inter alia

writs of Certiorari to quash the Resolution passed by the 1st Respondent dated 04.05.2023

marked P15(a), P15(b) and P15(c) published in the Gazette notification bearing No. 2331

and to quash the auction notice marked P17(a), P17(b) and P17(c) dated 31.07.2023.

The facts of this case are as follows:

According to the Petitioners, the Petitioners are spouses who carry on the business in the

name and style of Smart Design Center. The Petitioners state that on 19.01.2012, the

Petitioners purchased 1 Rood and 8.5 perches described as the property depicted in Plan

No. 1594 dated 31.01.1989 prepared by Sumanaratne D. Abeykoon Licensed Surveyor by

way of Deed of Transfer bearing No. 10468 dated 17.01.2012 attested by Thilak

Sumanaratne Notary Public.

The Petitioners further state that the Petitioners obtained a loan for the said business at

a specific value of Rs. 3,000,000/- at the rate of an annual interest of 3% from the 1st

Respondent and the Petitioners entered into Mortgage Bond bearing No. 2468 mortgaging

the entitlement of the 2nd Petitioner dated 17.09.2012 where it was specifically agreed

between the parties that the said Mortgage Bond was intended to cover the final balance

of account between the obligors and it was specifically in respect of all transactions and

dealings such final balance not to exceed in the whole the sum of Rs. 3,000,000/-. The

Petitioners aver that the Petitioners requested a further loan where the capital amount

was Rs. 2,000,000/- in 2013 to be paid within six months at an interest rate of 20% from

the 1st Respondent with the intention of manufacturing garments.

The Petitioners further aver that on or around 05.09.2013, the 1st Respondent released

the said Rs. 2,000,000/- to the account of the Petitioners bearing No. 73803565 which was

Page 5 of 10

maintained at the Bank of Ceylon Pannala branch. The Petitioners state that further to

the said loan, the Petitioners entered into a Mortgage Bond bearing No. 2553 dated

07.01.2013 by which the parties agreed that the said Mortgage Bond was executed in

respect of all transactions and dealings where such final balance not to exceed in the whole

the sum of Rs. 2,000,000/-.

The Petitioners further state that the Petitioners obtained another loan of Rs. 4,000,000/-

from the 1st Respondent at the rate of 9% per annum and entered into a Mortgage Bond

bearing No. 2956 dated 10.04.2014. According to the Petitioners, further to the said loans,

they were granted a loan of Rs. 2,088,000/- at the rate of 13% per annum by the 1st

Respondent and the parties entered into the Mortgage Bond bearing No. 3683 dated

16.10.2015.

The Petitioners contend that in all the loan transactions, the capital of the said loans did

not exceed Rs. 5,000,000/- and nor did the 1st Respondent take any steps to calculate the

said capital for an amount exceeding Rs. 5,000,000/-.

The Petitioners further state that the Petitioners from the year 2013, made payments

accordingly to the said account No. 73803565 and further made payments to the Suspense

Account to which the payments were made by the Petitioners as required by the Bank

accordingly. The Petitioners state that they were affected immensely due to the Easter

Attack in 2019.

As stated by the Petitioners, by letter dated 05.07.2019, the 1st Respondent informed the

Petitioners to deposit a further sum of Rs. 3.5 million and settle the sum of the arrears of

loan payments and reschedule the remaining money payable.

The Petitioners state that by letter dated 23.07.2019, the Petitioners informed that they

did not at any instance formally agree to reschedule the said loan and therefore requested

the 1st Respondent to grant a favourable scheme to repay in installments.

Page 6 of 10

The Petitioners further state that the Petitioners were sent a notice dated 17.05.2023 in

terms of Section 21 of the Bank of Ceylon Act No 34 of 1968 as amended together with the

Gazette notification bearing no. 2331 dated 04.05.2023 according to which the 1st

Respondent has caused a Resolution marked P15(a), (b), and (c) to be passed on 09.03.2023

claiming to reschedule sums of money which are below the value of executing parate

according to the Bank of Ceylon Act and the Recovery of Loans by Banks Act.

The Petitioners further aver that on 03.08.2023, the 1st Respondent informed the

Petitioners that the Notice for Auction has been put up in Newspapers marked P17(a),

(b), and (c) and that the Auction is to be held on 13.09.2023.

The main grievance of the Petitioners is that the 1st Respondent had acted ultra vires and

adopted the wrong procedure when passing the resolution marked P15(a), (b), and (c) and

therefore bad in law and that the Notice of Auction marked P17(a), (b) and (c) is bad in

law as the 1st Respondent has completely disregarded the provisions in Section 22 of the

Bank of Ceylon Ordinance on the basis that at the time of default, if the balance of the

principal amount borrowed was less than Rs. 5 million, the bank cannot resort to parate

execution based on Section 5A of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act

No. 4 of 1990 as amended.

In this context, the Petitioners have invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court seeking

inter alia writs of Certiorari to quash the Resolution passed by the 1st Respondent dated

04.05.2023 marked P15(a), P15(b) and P15(c) published in the Gazette notification

bearing No. 2331 and to quash the auction notice marked P17(a), P17(b) and P17(c) dated

31.07.2023.

On the other hand, the Respondents raise the objection that the documents marked P12

and P13, it is apparent that the Petitioners themselves prayed for the loans from the 1st

Page 7 of 10

Respondents to be rescheduled and thereby such were rescheduled as agreed by the

parties.

According to the document marked R1, it is clear that the loan given by the 1st Respondent

to the Petitioners was more than Rs. 5 million. We are mindful that both the Petitioners

and the 1st Respondent have agreed to reschedule the said loans which was denied by the

Petitioners.

We are also mindful that the original loan was obtained in the year 2012. But as depicted

in the document marked R7, the parties have agreed to reschedule in 2015 which was not

denied by the Petitioners. Also, as the present amount indicated in R13(a) and R13(b) up

to 07.09.2023, principal outstandings are Rs. 7,967,841.64/- and Rs.2,900,000.

According to the document marked R14, the 1st Respondent has indicated by letter dated

27.06.2022, that they are going to take steps unless the Petitioners pay the amount due

and specially indicating that the property will be sold by public auction in such instance

and requesting to pay the due amounts. It is true that the original loan taken by the

Petitioners was less than Rs. 5 million but, they have taken several loans during the said

period.

According to Section 25 of the Bank of Ceylon Act, which reads as follows:

In any case where more than one loan, overdraft, advance or other accommodation

has been granted by the bank on the security of the same property and default is

made in the payment of any sum due upon any one or more of such loans, overdraft,

advance or other accommodation, the foregoing provisions of this Ordinance shall

apply notwithstanding that default may not have been made in respect of any of

the other loans, overdraft, advance or other accommodation, and the board may,

in any such case, by resolution under section 19 authorize the sale of the property

for the recovery of the total amount due to the bank in respect of all such loans,

Page 8 of 10

overdraft, advance or other accommodation, as the case may be, and the provisions

of this Ordinance shall apply accordingly. (Emphasis added)

Therefore, the Bank of Ceylon has the power under Section 25 to calculate all the loans

together.

It is clear that the principal amount borrowed and due to the 1st Respondent is more than

Rs. 5 million without interest. Although the Petitioners initially obtained a loan below Rs.

5 million, later it has increased to an amount exceeding Rs. 5 million. The said amount

indicated by the Bank was at the point of the default and at that point, the principal

amount borrowed, due, and owing to the bank on the loan granted exceeded Rs. 5 million.

To get protection under Section 5A of the Recovery of Loans by Banks Act, at the time of

the default, the principal amount due should not exceed Rs. 5 million. This was considered

by His Lordship Samayawardhena J in Aqua World Private Limited and Another v.

Kuranage Marian Stella Rose Perera v. DFCC Bank And Others, SC APPEAL

NO. SC/Appeal/219/2016, Decided on 07.03.2024, held that;

For the purpose of section 5A, a Bank is not permitted to aggregate

multiple loan facilities, all secured by the same mortgage, in order surpass

the threshold of Rs. Five Million. The principal amount of each loan facility

should exceed Rs. Five million.

The proviso to section 5A (1) needs no interpretation; it is self-explanatory.

It state (a) at the time default (b) when calculating the principal amount

borrowed due and owing to the Bank (c ) on the loan granted to such

defaulter, (d ) the interest accrued on such loan and any penalty imposed

thereon, Shall not be taken into consideration.

The calculation has to be done at the point of default, and at that point; the

principal amount borrowed due and owing to the bank on the loan granted,

should exceed Rs. Five million.

Page 9 of 10

Learned Counsel for both parties restricted the argument to the following

question of law.

When the capital to be recovered is less than Rs. Five million as at the date

of resolution, can the bank resort to prate execution?

Before we part with this judgment, we are mindful of the sentiments expressed by His

Lordship Samayawardhena J with regard to the Recovery of Loans by Banks under the

Recovery of Loans by Banks Act in Bettans Group of Companies (Pvt) Ltd v. Lankaputhra

Development Bank and Others, CA/WRIT 230/2015, Decided on 10.07.2020 held that;

Before I part with this Judgment let me also add the following. The Petitioner

cannot invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court as of right. It is a discretionary

relief; an act of grace on the part of the Court. The fact that the loan was obtained

and the Petitioner is in default is undisputed. By this application, filed more than

five years ago, the Petitioner has prevented the Bank from recovering its dues

through parate execution-a quicker and faster procedure recognised by the law.

Banks are not charitable institutions; they are the cornerstones of economies. It

should be understood that similar to the Petitioner being engaged in a business,

granting loans with the expectation of timely repayment is a major part of the

ordinary course of business of a Bank. If a Bank is prevented from taking such

measures as it is entitled in law to take to protect its interests, the economy of the

country would suffer. The Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act was

passed to assist Banks to fast-track the procedure of debt recovery. There is no

place for high-flown technical objections under this Act.

For the said reasons, we dismiss the action with the costs of Rs. 100,000.
