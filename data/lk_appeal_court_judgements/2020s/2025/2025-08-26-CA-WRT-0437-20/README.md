JUDGEMENT

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J.

1. The petitioner claims to be the owner of a land in extent of 50 perches

situated at No. 148/6, New Galle Road, Egoda Uyana, Moratuwa, which

is depicted and described in deeds, bearing No. 959 dated 27.11.2020,

No. 799 dated 18.03.2018, and No. 801 dated 31.03.2018, all of which

were executed by P. K. M. N. Kulasuriya, Notary Public. This land is

also now depicted in Plan No. 1693 prepared by Licensed Surveyor, J.

Wilfrey Rodrigo. The Municipal Council of Moratuwa, the 1st

respondent, has embarked upon the laying of hume pipes, apparently

to drain rain water. Work did commence somewhere in December 2020.

This laying of pipes was proposed along the southern boundary of the

land claimed by the petitioner. The petitioner was not in occupation of

the said land and upon realising that work has commenced, the

petitioner complained to the Police and also the 1st respondent,

requesting that the said proposed project be stopped as it is on private

land.

2. However, the position of the 1st respondent had been that, in

accordance with the Surveyor General's cadastral plan bearing No.

520217, dated July 2010, there is an access road along the southern

boundary of the petitioner and the pipes are laid along the same. The

petitioner's position is that the said plan prepared by the Surveyor

General in the course of the 'Bim Saviya' Project is erroneous and

incorrect. Upon making complaints to the Municipal Council and the

Egoda Uyana Police, the petitioner instituted this writ application

against the Municipal Council of Moratuwa, the Municipal

Commissioner, the Surveyor General, the OIC of the Egoda Uyana

Police Station, the Acting IGP, and the Title Settlement Commissioner

General, seeking several relief which inter alia included a writ against

WRT/0437/20

Page 4 of 13

the 3rd respondent Surveyor General to prepare a corrected cadastral

drawing.

3. This application was filed in 2020, and during the pendency of the

application in the past five years, the 3rd respondent Surveyor General

has caused a re-survey and rectified and corrected the alleged

erroneous depiction of the access roadway along the southern boundary

of the petitioner's land. It is common ground and now admitted by all

parties that the said cadastral map, upon the correction, bears No.

520217, prepared by the 3rd respondent Surveyor General, dated

22.11.2024. A copy of this is now made available along with the 3rd

respondent's written submissions, marked X.' It is clear that the land

of the petitioner, now depicted as Lot No. 1 in the said cadastral

drawing, does not have any access road along its southern boundary as

depicted in the original cadastral map. In view of the rectification and

correction made by the 3rd respondent, the petitioner, when this was

taken up for argument, informed Court that he will limit this application

and pursue only with relief sought by prayer (b) and (c) (iii). By prayer

(b), the petitioner is seeking a writ of prohibition restraining the 1st and

2nd respondents and others under them, from continuing any further

digging, construction, or other activity on the petitioner's land except

strictly in accordance with the law and with due notice to the petitioner

and his entitlement to object and to be heard. Then, by prayer (c) (iii)

the petitioner is seeking a writ of mandamus directing the 1st and/or

the 2nd and/or the 3rd respondent/s to duly inquire into the damages

caused to the petitioner's property and compensate the petitioner for all

such damages. However, in the written submissions, the petitioner has

specifically stated that this relief is now pursued only against the 1st

and the 2nd respondents, and not against the 3rd respondent.

4. When this matter was taken up for argument, learned Counsel Mr.

Chrishmal Warnasooriya submitted that the 3rd respondent has now

rectified the original mistake of depicting a 10-foot access road along

WRT/0437/20

Page 5 of 13

the southern boundary. It was his position that the 1st respondent

Municipal Council has been acting maliciously to assist a person

named Neville Fernando, who happens to be a person with close

political affiliations to the former Mayor of Moratuwa. It is alleged that

he either influenced or was instrumental in having an access road

demarcated and depicted in the original cadastral map. It is also alleged

that the said Neville Fernando and several others who were politically

motivated made several attempts to prevent the petitioner from

developing and fencing his land, in or around April 2019. The petitioner

has lodged complaints with the Police marked P-10 (a) and P-10 (b). The

police are also alleged to not have properly investigated into this

complaint but directed the petitioner to get the Mayor to sort it out. The

petitioner having instituted this application, has obtained interim relief

and has also instituted a civil action in the District Court of Moratuwa

bearing No. 971/21 which appears to be an action for the declaration

of title. It is the position of the petitioner that the 1st respondent is now

attempting to pursue with the laying of the hume pipes on the guise of

the project directed by the then President in 2019, titled "Sapiri Gamak"

which is based on an election manifesto. It is the argument of Mr.

Warnasooriya that a political manifesto does not authorize the 1st

respondent Municipal Council to construct on private lands. The

petitioner has not had due notice prior to the commencement of the

said project, as required by Section 97 of the Municipal Councils

Ordinance No. 29 of 1947 (hereinafter sometimes referred to as 'the

Ordinance). The petitioner claims that they are entitled to relief on the

bases of illegality, irrationality, procedural impropriety, as well as

substantive legitimate expectation.

5. According to the objections filed by the respondents and submissions

made during the argument, the position of the 1st respondent is that

under S. 59 of the Ordinance, the respondent has the power to carry

out such work and as this application entails several matters of fact

that are in dispute, it is not amenable to the writ jurisdiction. It is also

WRT/0437/20

Page 6 of 13

argued that as a District Court matter is already pending, and the

petitioner has an alternate remedy which also disentitles them to the

remedy available by writ.

6. Then, it is also the petitioner's position that in view of the original

cadastral map, as there was a 10-foot roadway along the southern

boundary, this project was proposed to go over the said access road so

depicted. The said cadastral map is marked and produced as P-6. It is

also submitted that this project was effected under the programme

called Sapiri Gamak of the Ministry of Finance, Economy and Policy

Development (Circular No. 001 of 2019). A sum of Rs. 1 million has

been set aside for this project. The respondents deny any influence or

any other political object to this programme and reiterated their

position that under Section 59 of the Ordinance, the 1st respondent is

entitled to construct drains even over private land.

Consideration of the Arguments

7. The sum total of the respondents' position is that this was a project

under the Sapiri Gamak development plan, and even if it is private

land, the 1st respondent is entitled to lay pipes or make drains. S. 59

of the Municipal Councils Ordinance reads as follows:

59. The proper officer of any Municipal Council shall have power to make, scour, cleanse, and keep open all ditches, gutters, drains, or watercourses along any street within the Municipality, and also to make and lay such drains, watercourses, trunks, tunnels, plats, or bridges, as he may deem necessary for the protection, preservation, improvement, repair, or construction of any street or intended street, in and through any lands or grounds adjoining or lying near to such street or intended street.

On a plain reading of this provision, it appears that the Municipal

Council has the power to lay pipes in and through any lands or

grounds adjoining or lying near to such street or intended street.

WRT/0437/20

Page 7 of 13

8. In response to this, it is the position of the petitioner that the applicable

provisions are Sections 97, 107, and 108 of the Municipal Councils

Ordinance, which read as follows:

97. The Government or any Municipal Council may, from time to time, cause to be made, altered, or extended such public main or other drains, sewers and watercourses as may appear to be necessary for the effectual draining of the Municipality, and, if necessary, the Government or the Council may carry them through, across, or under any street or any place laid out as or intended for a street, or any cellar or vault which is under any of the streets, and (after reasonable notice in writing in that behalf) into, through, or under any enclosed or other lands whatsoever, doing as little damage as may be and making full compensation for any damage done.

107. (1) Where any premises are within one hundred feet of any public drain or other fit place into which drains may lawfully be discharged, the Council may, by notice in writing, served on the owner of such premises, require such owner within such time as may be specified in the notice, to provide and execute to the satisfaction of the Council, in accordance with any by-laws for the time being in force, all or any of the following works that the Council may deem necessary for the effectual drainage of such premises, that is to say:

(a) to provide and construct such channels, drains, gullies, manholes, and appliances as may be necessary for the removal and discharge into such drain or other fit place of sullage, foul liquids and rain water; (b) where a sufficient water supply is available, to provide and construct sufficient and suitable water-closets or additional water-closets and drains and other appliances in connection therewith, and to convert any earth closet, privy, cesspit, closet, or other latrine into a water-closet, or abolish any such earth closet, privy, cesspit, closet or other latrine; (c) to reconstruct, take up, and remove or fill up any existing drain or appliance (other than any drain or appliance that has been laid with the sanction of the Council for the drainage of such premises on the water carriage system) that may be, in the opinion of the Council, unnecessary or insanitary. (2) Every owner who fails or neglects to comply with the requirements of any notice served on him under subsection (1) within the time specified

WRT/0437/20

Page 8 of 13

in the notice shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred rupees. 108. (1) In the case of any premises which are more than one hundred feet, but less than two hundred feet, from any public drain or other fit place into which drains may lawfully be discharged, the Council may, by notice in writing served on the owner of such premises, require such owner within such time as may be specified in the notice, to provide and execute, in accordance with any by-laws for the time being in force, all or any of the works referred to in section 107. (2) If in the opinion of the Council there is no suitable public drain or other fit place into which drains may lawfully be discharged within a reasonable distance of such premises, the Council may, by notice in writing served on the owner of such premises require the said owner, within such time as may be specified in the said notice, to provide and execute such other works and undertake such other measures as may in the opinion of the Council be best or necessary for the proper collection and disposal of the sullage and foul liquids, and the removal of faecal matter from such premises. (3) Every owner who fails or neglects to comply with the requirements of any notice served on him under subsection (I) or subsection (2) within the time specified in the notice shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty rupees." 9. Relying on the above provisions, it was submitted that if pipelines were

required to be so laid over private land, it should be upon the complying

of the pre-condition of giving reasonable notice and affording due notice

to the landowner. It was argued that no such notice was afforded. On a

perusal of the totality of the material, it is evident that the erroneous

cadastral plan made in the year 2010, along the southern boundary of

the land as an access road between the Galle Road and the railway line

vide P-6. That being so, the decision and the commencement of a project

to lay pipes along the said access road so depicted may not strictly

require notice as contemplated by the said provisions. It is in 2024 that

the cadastral plan was corrected and rectified. It is upon the said

rectification that the access road ceased to exist on the cadastral plan.

WRT/0437/20

Page 9 of 13

To that extent, one cannot directly or positively attribute mala fides to

the decision of laying a pipeline along such an access road. However,

the implementation of the said project was stayed by this Court. In the

interim, in 2024, the entire land was depicted as private land as Lot No.

01 in the said cadastral plan No. 520257 dated 22.11.2024.

10. If the 1st respondent still desires to proceed with the project, the 1st

respondent is required to comply with the said statutory provisions.

Notwithstanding the fact of the amended cadastral plan being brought

to the notice of the respondents during the course of this proceeding, it

appears that the 1st respondent still intends and desires to continue

with the laying of pipelines as proposed. There is no intimation to the

contrary made, even at the stage of argument. Therefore, for all intents

and purposes, it appears that the 1st respondent may still proceed with

the laying of the pipes as planned.

11. In these circumstances, as the proposed path of laying the said pipeline

would be over private land, the 1st respondent would require to follow

the procedure as specified by Sections 97, 107, and 108, as the case

may be. This certainly requires giving reasonable notice to such

landowner. In the said circumstances, relief sought by prayer (b)

becomes relevant. Relief sought thereby is for a writ of prohibition

preventing the 1st and 2nd respondents from continuing with the

construction or activity of laying the pipeline as proposed without giving

notice. As observed above, the 1st respondent has not made any

intimation to discontinue the project as proposed.

12. The object and purpose of the writ of prohibition, as Lord Denning M.R.

stated in R. vs. Greater London Council ex parte Blackburn [1976]

1 WLR 550 is to prohibit administrative authorities from exceeding their

powers, or misusing them. Wade & Forsyth on Administrative Law (11th

Ed., at page 511) provides as follows:

WRT/0437/20

Page 10 of 13

Although a prohibiting order was originally used to prevent tribunals from meddling with cases over which they had no jurisdiction, it was equally effective, and equally often used, to prohibit the execution of some decision already taken but ultra vires. So long as the tribunal or administrative authority still had some power to exercise as a consequence of the wrongful decision, the exercise of that power could be restrained by a prohibiting order.

Dr. Sunil Cooray in Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka

describes the object of the writ of prohibition as follows:

The Writ of Prohibition is available to prevent a proceeding in a given matter, to exercise a power which it does not have under the law, or act in violation of the rules of natural justice where the law requires such officer or authority to observe them. The Writ of Prohibition is not a remedy to restrain the doing of a purely physical act, to restrain which the proper remedy is an injunction. Further, where it is necessary to restrain an official from purporting to exercise power which he does not have, it is an order in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition to restrain him that must be sought, and not a mandamus to compel him not to act."

Accordingly, I hold that the petitioner is entitled to the writ of prohibition

as prayed for by prayer (b).

13. As for the issue of compensation, the petitioner is seeking that a writ of

mandamus be issued against the 1st and 2nd respondents to inquire

into and pay compensation for the damages caused. To this end the

petitioner relies on Section 97 which provides for making full

compensation for any damage caused as well as Section 302 of the

Ordinance, which provides as follows:

302. A Municipal Council may make compensation out of the Municipal Fund to all persons sustaining any damage by reason of the exercise of any of the powers vested in the Council, officers or servants by or under this Ordinance.

When Section 97 is read with Section 302, a discretion is vested with

the Municipal Council to make out the payment of compensation.

WRT/0437/20

Page 11 of 13

14. It is now settled law that a petitioner seeking a writ of mandamus

should, in the first instance, demand that such duty be performed. It is

only if such duty is not exercised upon such demand a person is entitled

to invoke the writ jurisdiction seeking a mandamus. Wade & Forsyth on

Administrative Law (11th Ed., at page 528, Requirement of Demand

and Refusal) states the follows:

It has been said to be an 'imperative rule' that an applicant for mandatory order must have first made an express demand to the defaulting authority, calling upon it to perform its duty, and that the authority must have refused. But these formalities are application, and refusal to perform the duty is readily implied from conduct. The substantial requirement is that the public authority should have been clearly informed as to what the applicant expected it to do, so that it might decide at its own option whether to act or not. (emphasis added).

J. A. N. De Silva, J., (as His Lordship then was) with Their Lordships S.

N. Silva C.J., and Weerasuriya J., agreeing, in Credit Information

Bureau of Sri Lanka v. Messrs Jafferjee and Jafferjee (Pvt.) Ltd.

(2005) 1 SLR 89 clearly set out some basic requirements to be satisfied

for a writ of mandamus to issue, where inter alia a demand that such

duty be performed was highlighted:

There is rich and profuse case law on Mandamus on the conditions to be satisfied by the Applicant. Some of the conditions precedent the issue of Mandamus appear to be:

(a) The Applicant must have a legal right to the performance of a legal duty by the parties against whom the Mandamus is sought (R v Barnstaple Justices). The foundation of Mandamus is the existence of a legal right (Napier Ex Parte)

(b) The right to be enforced must be a "Public Right" and the duty sought to be enforced must be of a public nature.

(e) The application must be preceded by a distinct demand for the performance of the duty

.

WRT/0437/20

Page 12 of 13

The above principles governing the issue of a writ of Mandamus were also discussed at length in P.K. Benarji v. H.J. Simonds. Whether the facts show the existence of any or all pre-requisites to the granting of the writ is a question of law in each case to be decided not in any rigid or technical view of the question, but according to a sound and reasonable interpretation. The court will not grant a Mandamus to enforce a right not of a legal but of a purely equitable nature however extreme the inconvenience to which the applicant might be put. (emphasis added).

Therefore, it is clear that a petitioner seeking a writ of mandamus in

the normal course of events is required to have requested/ demanded

the performance of such duty from the relevant authority. In the present

instance, there is no material placed before this Court to that effect.

15. I will not venture to consider if the petitioner has any legitimate right to

obtain compensation. However, the absence of a demand to exercise

such statutory power of computing and awarding compensation

disentitles the petitioner to seek a writ of mandamus from this Court in

the first instance. Accordingly, I hold that the petitioner is not entitled

to the writ of mandamus as prayed for by prayer (c) (iii) of the petition.

16. Further, malice is no doubt alleged. However, considering the

circumstances that existed at that point of time, did enable the 1st and

2nd respondents to lawfully act as they did. This is for the simple reason

that the error in the cadastral map of depicting a 10-foot access road. I

also observe that a reference is made to one Neville Fernando who

appears to have been living in that vicinity. Though it is alleged that the

said Neville Fernando was instrumental and has influenced the 1st and

2nd respondents to act as they did, there is no material to substantiate

or confirm the said allegation.

17. For the reasons stated above, I see no basis to grant the relief as prayed

for by prayer (c) (iii). However, I am of the view that the petitioner is

entitled to relief as prayed for by prayer (b). Accordingly, writ of

prohibition is granted, restraining the 1st and 2nd respondents, and

WRT/0437/20

Page 13 of 13

others under them, from continuing with any further digging,

construction, or other activity on the petitioner's land, except strictly in

accordance with the law and with due notice to the petitioner and his

entitlement to object and to be heard.

18. Application is allowed to that extent. However, I make no order as to

costs.

19. Application is partially allowed.
