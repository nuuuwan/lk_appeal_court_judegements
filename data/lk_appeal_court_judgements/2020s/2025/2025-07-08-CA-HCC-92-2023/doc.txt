Judgment

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) has

been indicted in the High Court of Rathnapura in the High Court Case

No. 38/2014. The charge in the indictment is as follows:

That on or about May 08,2009, at Galinna, within the

jurisdiction of the High Court of Rathnapura, the appellant

did commit the act of grave sexual abuse on the female child

by placing his penis between the thighs of the said female

child, an offence punishable under section 365B(2)(b) of the

Penal Code (as amended by Act No.22 of 1995 and Act No. 29

of 1998 and Act No.16 of 2006).

Page 3 of 14

2. Upon the indictment being forwarded to the High Court, the Learned

High Court Judge has caused the appellant to appear in Court and has

served the indictment together with its annexures on the appellant.

Upon, the appellant pleading not guilty to the charge, the matter has

been taken up for trial without a jury. At the conclusion of the trial, the

Learned High Court Judge by a judgment dated January 30,2023 has

convicted the appellant and sentenced the appellant to 8 years rigorous

imprisonment. The Learned High Court Judge has also imposed a fine

of Rs. 5000 with a term of 4 months imprisonment in default. The

appellant has also been ordered to pay a sum of Rs. 100,000 as

compensation to PW01 with a further term of 1-year imprisonment in

default.

3. The appellant being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentencing

order, has preferred the instant appeal to this Court and prayed that

the judgement and the sentencing order dated January 30,2023 be set

aside.

4. When the matter was taken up for argument, the Learned Counsel for

the appellant urged the following grounds of appeal;

i. Has the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider that

the main ingredient of the charge has not been proven

beyond a reasonable doubt by the prosecution?

ii. Has the Learned High Court Judge erred in law by not

allowing to mark a vital contradiction during the cross

examination of PW01?

Page 4 of 14

iii. Has the Learned High Court Judge failed to evaluate the

evidence of PW12 accurately?

iv. Has the Learned High Court Judge failed to evaluate the

evidence of PW02, PW03, and PW08 accurately?

5. PW01 has been born at the General Hospital in Rathnapura on October

08, 1996. She has been living with her parents and her siblings at

Gallina, Rathnapura at the time referred to in the charge.

6. PW02 is the mother of PW01, PW03 a sibling of PW01 and the appellant,

the son of an uncle of PW02, therefore, closely related to the mother of

PW01. The appellants house has been situated about 50 metres away

from the house in which PW01 lived with her parents and siblings.

7. On May 08,2009, the appellant has come to the house of PW01, and

informed her parents that the wife and children of the appellant had

gone out of town. The appellant has also requested that PW01 be

permitted to go along with the him to his house as the appellant was

feeling uncomfortable to spend the night alone in his house. The

parents of PW01 have not objected, hence, PW01 has gone to the house

of the appellant along with him.

8. On the way to the appellants house, PW01 and the appellant had met

PW03 sometime before 20.00 hrs on that day close to a bana gedara.

The appellant has invited PW03 also to visit his house when PW03 was

done, attending a bana gedara.

Page 5 of 14

9. When PW01 reached the house of the appellant, she had gone to sleep

on a bed while the appellant occupied the adjoining bed. After a while

the appellant has switched on the light in the room. Thereafter, the

appellant has proceeded to undress PW01. Following which, he himself

has removed the cloths he was dressed in. At first the appellant has

stroked the legs of PW01. Subsequently, got onto PW01 who was lying

face upwards and engaged in a sexual act with her by placing the

appellants penis between the legs of PW01. When the appellant

engaged in such sexual act, PW01 has felt the penis of the appellant

coming in contact with the upper parts of her inner thighs and her

vagina.

10. Responding to the invitation extended to him by the appellant, PW03

has gone to the house of the appellant, but found the door of the house

closed. Thereafter, at about 21.30 hrs, PW03 has returned to the house

of the appellant. Observing a light burning in a room in the house PW03

has peeped into the room, through the spaces in between the wooden

strips of a window of that room. PW03 has seen the appellant naked on

top of PW01 engaging in a sexual act with the latter. Shortly after

PW03 has informed his parents about the incident he witnessed. PW02

together with the father of PW01 have gone to the house of the

appellant, there they have witnessed the appellant engaging in a sexual

act with PW01. The father has screamed at the appellant, at which time

the appellant has walked out of his house. The parents of PW01 have

taken her to the police station immediately, logged a complaint, and

provided statements. An investigation has commenced and PW01

referred to a judicial medical officer for examination. The particular

judicial medical officer after examining PW01 has prepared a medico-

legal report. The report has been marked -1.

11. The Learned Counsel for the appellant has contended that though the

main ingredient in the charge is intercrural sex, PW01 has testified to

Page 6 of 14

the effect that she was penetrated by the appellant. Also, contended

that, though PW01 had at the beginning only stated that the appellant

had stroked her legs, following a leading question being put to PW01 by

the Learned State Counsel, PW01 had gone on to testify that the penis

of the appellant came into contact with the upper part of her inner

thighs. In those circumstances, it has been submitted that the sexual

act stipulated in the charge has not been proved beyond a reasonable

doubt. PW01 narrating the sexual act committed on her by the

appellant has stated that the appellant placed his penis between her

legs that were spread at that moment and the penis of the appellant

came into contact with her vagina. Thereafter a question has been

posed to PW01 by the Learned State Counsel as to whether the penis of

the appellant also came into contact with the upper part of the inner

thighs of PW01. PW01 has answered in the affirmative. This is evident

through portions of the evidence recorded in pages 76 to 80 of the brief;

Page 7 of 14

12. PW01, has been 19 years of age when she gave evidence in the High

Court. She is from a village situated away from the city of Rathnapura.

The upbringing in such a village set up would have been simple. But

good behaviour that aligns with the ethical standards of her

community, i.e. good moral character, expected from her. The sexual

Page 8 of 14

act referred to in the charge has been allegedly committed on her when

she was just 12 years old. Being subjected to such sexual abuse, the

experience would naturally be harrowing to her. PW01 would have

preferred not to talk about the incident. She would have naturally liked

to forget about the incident as soon as possible. Further, PW01 when

giving evidence before the High Court, would have been aware of the

negative association between her and the society due to the incident

she was testifying to. The testimony of PW01 shows that PW01 has been

reluctant to testify to the incident at the trial before the High Court. She

has therefore been a reluctant witness. In those circumstances, a fair

amount of coaxing and persuasion would have been needed to extract

the relevant evidence from her.

13. In those circumstances, the contention that the sexual act stipulated

in the charge has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt lacks

merit.

14. In D. Tikiribanda vs. Attorney General, CA 64/2003 decided on

06.10.2009, Ranjith Silva, J, has stated,

Mostly the victims of sexual harassment prefer not to talk

about the harrowing experience and would like to forget about

the incident as soon as possible (withdrawal symptom). The

offenders should not be allowed to capitalize or take mean

advantage of these natural inherent weaknesses of small

children.

15. The Counsel for the appellant has also contended that the Learned

High Court Judge has erred in law by not allowing to mark a vital

Page 9 of 14

contradiction during the cross examination of PW01. To substantiate

such contention, the Learned Counsel for the appellant has drawn the

attention of this Court to the following portion of evidence recorded in

page 100 of the brief;

16. Section 145 of the Evidence Ordinance No. 15 of 1895 provides for the

manner in which a witness could be cross examined and confronted

with statements made by such witnesses previously.

Page 10 of 14

17. Section 145 of the Evidence Ordinance provides,

(1) A witness may be cross-examined as to previous

statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing and

relevant to matters in question without such writing being

shown to him, or being proved; but if it is intended to contradict

him by the writing, his attention must, before the writing can

be proved, be called to those parts of it which are to be used

for the purpose of contradicting him.

(2) If a witness, upon cross-examination as to a previous oral

statement made by him relevant to matters in question in the

suit or proceeding in which he is cross-examined and

inconsistence with his present testimony, does not distinctly

admit that he made such statement, proof may be given that

he did in fact make it; but before such proof can be given the

circumstances of the supposed statement sufficient to

designate the particular occasion must be mentioned to the

witness, and he must be asked whether or not he made such

a statement.

18. In Agampodi Wijepala de Soyza vs. Officer-in-Charge and Another [SC

Appeal 159/2018, S.C. minute dated 07.07.2021] P. Padman Surasena,

J, has stated,

The scheme of the above section clearly demands that the

following mandatory steps must be adhered to, when marking

and proving an inconsistency.

Firstly, a cross-examining counsel who intends to show that

the evidence of the witness under cross examination is

contradictory with a previous statement made by him, must

Page 11 of 14

ask questions relevant to such matters in question without

such previous statements being shown to him.

Secondly, if such witness comes out with something that is

prima facie inconsistent with any part of such statement, it is

then only the section allows such counsel to bring such parts

of such statement which are to be used for the purpose of

contradicting him, to the attention of such witness.

Thirdly, if such witness has stated something inconsistent

with his previous statement and does not distinctly admit

making such previous statement, then the cross-examining

counsel is under a duty as per sub section 2 of the above

section to ask whether or not such witness has made such a

previous statement.

Fourthly, it is thereafter only the cross-examining counsel can

proceed to prove that such witness has in fact made such a

previous statement.

19. When one examines the portion of evidence reproduced above, it is

clear that the Learned Counsel who defended the appellant in the High

Court trial has not drawn the attention of PW01 to a specific statement

made by her at the investigation stage of the crime. Further, he has not

posed any questions in cross examination to reveal that the evidence of

PW01 is contradictory to a previous statement made by her. The

relevant questions in cross examination have been put to PW01 in to

seek whether the testimony of PW01 echo with that given in

examination-in-chief.

Page 12 of 14

20. In those circumstances, the Learned High Court Judge was correct

when she made an order disallowing the Learned Counsel from posing

questions in that manner to PW01.

21. Dr. W. M. K. B. Wijethunga, assistant judicial medical officer, of the

provincial general hospital of Rathnapura has examined PW01 on

09.05.2009 and prepared a medico-legal report. The report has been

marked -1 through PW12 i.e. Dr. M. R. Dissanayake, assistant

judicial medical officer of the Kandy general hospital. The report

marked -1 has been produced and marked through PW12 as Dr. W.

M. K. B. Wijethunga could not be summoned to appear in the High Court

at that particular period. Prior to Dr. Dissanayakes evidence being led

on the report marked -1, the prosecution has also led evidence to

demonstrate the connection between PW12 and Dr. Wijethunga. The

competency of PW12 to testify based on the contents in the report

marked -1 has also been established. The appellant has also not

disputed the competency of PW12 in that regard. Therefore, an

admission in that regard has been recorded as per the provisions

stipulated in section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15

of 1979. PW12 has also been cross-examined by the appellant, in that

instance, PW12 has explained in detail the contents -1 and also

about the probable causes for the findings stated therein upon the

general examination of PW01. Due to the aforesaid reasons it is the

belief of this Court, that the appellant cannot at this late stage state

that the medical officer who prepared the report marked -1 would

have been the best person to give evidence based on such report and

such omission has affected the outcome of the trial in an adverse

manner.

Page 13 of 14

22. It is also contended that, the inherent features in the window of the

room in which the alleged incident took place has not been corroborated

by PW08, the investigating officer who visited the scene of the incident.

23. It is the testimony of PW08 that the particular window was a wooden

one. However, since he has visited the scene during the day he has not

proceeded to switch on the light inside the room and probe as to

whether a person could see into the room as stated by PW03. However,

the testimony corroborates the fact that the room in which the alleged

incident took place was fixed with a wooden window, though there had

been a minor lapse on the part of PW08 as to the manner in which he

has probed the particular venue. Such a lapse, in the opinion of this

Court, is not material.

24. Further, PW02 and PW03 have testified before the High Court in the

year 2018, i.e. nine years after the alleged incident. The Learned

Counsel for the appellant has drawn the attention of Court to an inter-

se contradiction regarding PW03 going back for the third time (along

with his parents), to the appellant's house, and supposedly seen the

appellant engaging in a sexual act with PW01.

25. PW03 has gone to the house of the appellant on three occasions that

evening. On his first visit he has found the door of that particular house

closed. PW03 has returned to the appellants house for the second time.

On that occasion, he has observed a light in a room in the house was

switched on. Thereafter, he has peeped into the room as described

earlier and seen the appellant engaging in a sexual act with PW01.

PW03 has immediately informed his parents of the incident he saw.

Thereafter, the parents have rushed to the appellants house to free

PW01 from the appellant. In those circumstances, the contradiction

Page 14 of 14

marked V2 nor the per-se contradiction referred to by the Learned

Counsel for the appellant are material and, in my view, do not

undermine the credibility of PW03.

26. Further, the actions of the appellant indicate preplanning and

manipulation hence, the existence of aggravating circumstances to be

taken into consideration when meting out punishment to the appellant.

27. Accordingly, I am not inclined to interfere with the impugned judgment

together with the sentencing order. I therefore dismiss the appeal.

I make no order regarding costs.

28. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment

to the High Court in Rathnapura for compliance.

Appeal dismissed.
