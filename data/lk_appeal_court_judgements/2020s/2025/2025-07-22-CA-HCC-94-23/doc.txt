JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted before the

High Court of Vavuniya for having committed the offence of abduction and rape on

Nagarathnam Brintha on 05.10.2016, punishable under Section 354 and Section 364 (2)(e)

of the Penal Code as amended by No. 29 of 1998 and no. 16 of 2006.

At the trial prosecution led the evidence through 11 witnesses and marking productions

P1 and P2, and thereafter closed its case. The Accused, in his defence made a dock

statement.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge found the accused guilty on

both counts. Accordingly, the Learned High Court judge imposed 2 years of rigorous

imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 5000/- with a default sentence of 1 month rigorous

imprisonment and for the 2nd count, 12 years of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine

Rs. 5,000 with a default sentence 1 month rigorous imprisonment. Furthermore,

compensation in the sum of Rs. 100,000 carrying in default term of 01-year simple

imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the afore-mentioned conviction and the sentence, the Accused has

preferred this appeal to this Court.

The following grounds for appeal were set out in the written submission.

1. The trial has been conducted in violation of the provisions of Section 142 of the

Evidence Ordinance, thereby occasioning a deprivation of a fair trial

2. Evidence of the prosecutrix is ambiguous and inconsistent on the question of

penetration

The facts and circumstances are that;

According to the testimony of PW 01, Nagarathnam Brintha, who was in grade 8 when

the offence was committed on 05.10.2016 and 16 years old at the time of giving evidence.

The accused, who resided next door to the prosecutrix, called as Priya and asked for a

water bottle. Responding to the Accused's request, PW 01 brought the bottle near the

fence. He then asked her to come closer to see why he was calling her. Trusting him, she

walked toward the gate. When the PW 01 tried to shout, the Accused trapped the childs

mouth and laid her down on the bed. After he had sexual intercourse with her, and asked

the child to leave.

She has told this incident to her neighbour, witness no. 04. According to the witness No.

04, namely Sasi kumar, he has seen the accused taken the child to the accuseds house.

The main ground urged by the accused was that the state counsel had asked leading

questions about the penetration, which is a violation of the provisions of the Evidence

Ordinance.

What is a leading question?

Section 141 of the Evidence Ordinance

Any question suggesting the answer which the person putting it wishes or expects to

receive is called a leading question.

Upon reviewing the testimony of PW1, it is evident that no leading questions were posed

by the state counsel. However, the counsel did ask follow-up questions that stemmed

directly from the answers provided by the prosecutrix.

An analysis of the aforementioned questions and responses reveals that the child was

hesitant to disclose the details of the incident. Our courts have consistently recognized

that victims of rape or sexual harassment often seek to avoid the emotional distress and

embarrassment associated with recounting such experiences. This is particularly true for

children, who tend to suppress or avoid discussing traumatic events and may wish to

forget the incident as quickly as possible.

We are mindful of the observation made by W.L. Ranjith Silva, J in the case of

D.Tikiribanda v. Attorney General, 2010 BLR 92, held that;

It is not surprising that there is an omission as distinct from a contradiction

(omissions on material points may amount to contradictions) in the evidence of the victim

as to the description/narration as to the offence and as to how the preparation of the

offence took place. A victim of sexual harassment is more often than not compelled to

make statements and give evidence in court. We must realize that shes not doing so for

the pleasure of it but because she is compelled to do so. Even though such complaints may

appear to be voluntary yet they may not be voluntary in the true sense. This is what is

called secondary victimization. This is somewhat like adding insult to injury. Any victim

of rape or sexual harassment would like to avoid the embarrassment of talking about, let

alone repeating the narration of such a shameful incident, if she could, Naturally it is

reasonable and realistic to believe that a victim of sexual harassment would be in a

trauma before, soon after the incident and sometimes even thereafter. In most of the Child

abuse and child rape cases the complainants are belated due to a sense of shame, fear,

embarrassment or ignorance. These incidents are brought to light invariably after much

questioning and persuasion. Mostly the victims of sexual harassment prefer not to talk

about the harrowing experience and would like to forget about the incident as soon as

Page 8 of 9

possible (withdrawal symptom). The offenders should not be allowed to capitalize or take

mean advantage of these natural and inherent weaknesses of small children. Under such

circumstances it is only a counsel who appears for an accused who cloud even suggest that

such trivial contradictions should be considered as decisive.

Therefore, it cannot be reasonably expected from a person in the prosecutrix's

circumstances to recall the horrendous turn of events she experienced as a child with

absolute precision. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for a victim of an unfortunate event

to feel diminished and remain silent rather than be vocal about it.

The Accused claims that the PW 01 had not testified that the Appellant had inserted his

male organ into her Virgina.

We are satisfied that the prosecution has established the fact of penetration. Although

the prosecutrix did not explicitly name the male organ, she adequately described how the

penetration occurred. It is important to note that the prosecutrix, a Grade 8 student, lacks

the maturity and knowledge required to articulate the specifics of a sexual assault. She

is, undeniably, a victim of such an assault.

Furthermore, we take into account the findings of the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who

examined the prosecutrix. According to the Medico-Legal Report (MLR), the JMO

observed mild redness and tenderness in the lower part of both labia minora and the

vulva, specifically in the lower half of the introitus. These clinical observations, as

recorded in the MLR, substantiate one of the essential elements of the offence of namely,

penetration.

Section 142 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Leading questions must not, if objected to by the adverse party, be asked in an

examination-in-chief or in a re-examination, except with the permission of the court.

Accordingly, the defence counsel failed to raise any objection to the question posed by the

state counsel. In applying Section 142 of the Evidence Ordinance, it is clear that no

objection was recorded at the time the question was asked during the trial.

With regard to the defence version, the Learned High Court Judge has thoroughly

analysed the evidence and reached a reasoned conclusion. We are satisfied that the

Page 9 of 9

testimony of the prosecutrix is consistent and credible, with no compelling grounds to

disbelieve her account.

We are also mindful of the well-established principle that the Court of Appeal will not

readily interfere with the trial judges findings on the acceptance or rejection of witness

testimony, unless such findings are manifestly erroneous.

In my considered opinion, the prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

For the foregoing reasons, I find no justification to interfere with the judgment of the

Learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly, the conviction and sentence are affirmed.

The appeal is hereby dismissed.
