JUDGEMENT

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J.

1. This application was taken up for argument on 26.06.2025. The learned

State Counsel appeared for the 1st, 5th , 6th and 7th respondents, and

the 2nd, 3rd and 4th respondents were represented by their Counsel

Thanuka Nandasiri, Attorney-at-Law, and Ms. Bhagya Herath,

Attorney-at-Law, appeared for the petitioners. Several dates have been

granted for the respondents to file objections. However, none of the

respondents have filed their objections. Accordingly, this was taken up

for argument.

Facts.

2. The Wijesuriya Mudiyanselage Kumarihami, the grandmother of the

petitioner, was issued with the grant P-2 in respect of an extent of 2

roods of land under the Land Development Ordinance (hereinafter

referred to as the LDO). The said grant is registered in the Register of

Permits and Grants in the District of Nuwara Eliya (vide P-3). On

17.12.2020, the petitioners grandmother has nominated the petitioner

and the 4th respondent as successors (vide P-8 and P-9). P-9 is the copy

of the perfected prescribed form of nomination, Form LC 155, according

to which nomination, the 4th respondent and the petitioner were

nominated to succeed to 20 perches and 60 perches respectively.

3. The petitioners grandmother Kumarihami then died on 21.05.2022.

Upon her demise, the 2nd and 3rd respondents appear to have disputed

the claim of the petitioner and the petitioner has made an application

to the 1st respondent Divisional Secretary to intervene. The 1st

respondent has then held an inquiry summoning the petitioners father,

2nd respondent, and the 3rd respondent on 09.10.2023. The petitioner

had also been present at the said inquiry. Upon the said inquiry, the 1st

respondent had found that the failure to register the nomination is due

to an oversight of the Divisional Secretariat and that the successors be

WRT/0021/24

Page 4 of 10

determined in respect of the land as nominated and proposed to seek

advice from the Land Commissioner General. The relevant inquiry

recommendation is marked P-12. The finding is as follows:

. ... .

. ...

.

4. Thereafter, the petitioners father had received a letter dated

22.11.2023, calling him, along with the 2nd and 3rd respondents, for a

fresh inquiry to be held on 27.11.2023. Upon the said inquiry, the 1st

respondent has informed the parties to have this matter determined by

a competent Court. The relevant inquiry recommendation is marked P-

16. The 1st respondent has informed that:

.

5. It is the petitioners position that since the 1st respondent had already

determined this issue, it was not lawful for the 1st respondent to change

the said finding at the second inquiry, and accordingly moves inter alia

for a writ of certiorari to quash P-16. The petitioner is also seeking a writ

of mandamus directing the 1st respondent to register and give effect to

the succession as per the nominations made by the original owner.

6. The petitioner, in short, is seeking a mandamus to direct the 1st

respondent to register/effect and enter the succession as per the

nominations made by P-9. No doubt, this nomination has been made

on the prescribed form; however there had not been any registration of

the same. According to P-3, the extract of the register, last registered

item in respect of this land is the grant issued to Kumarihami, the

grandmother of the petitioner. The finding upon the original inquiry

held on 09.10.2023 is that due to an oversight on the part of the office

(of the 1st respondent) the registration of the nomination had not been

made and it is observed that it is suitable to determine the succession

WRT/0021/24

Page 5 of 10

as per the said nomination. It appears that there is no decision made

in P-12 but only certain observations. In these circumstances, holding

a subsequent inquiry does not appear to be unwarranted or improper.

However, at the second inquiry (vide P-16), the 1st respondent has

concluded that the parties be advised to sort this matter out before a

competent Court. The main issue is the non-registration of the

nomination.

Who is under a duty to register the nomination?

7. In this application, the 1st respondent Divisional Secretary had

admitted in P-12 that the failure to register the nomination was due to

an oversight and inaction on the part of the Divisional Secretariat.

According to the provisions of the LDO, the nomination of a successor

is required to be made and registered during the lifetime of the permit

holder or owner.

Section 49 provides that; Upon the death of a permit-holder or of an

owner of a holding, a person nominated as successor by such permit-

holder or owner shall succeed to that land or holding.

Section 58 provides as follows: A document (other than a last will)

whereby the nomination of a successor is effected or cancelled shall not

be valid unless and until it has been registered by the Registrar of Lands

of the district in which the holding or land to which that document refers

is situated. (2) Regulations may be made prescribing the procedure for

the registration of documents whereby nominations of successors are

effected or cancelled and for all matters connected therewith or incidental

thereto, including the registers which shall be kept and the fees which

shall be charged for such registration.

8. Such nomination is required to be made on the prescribed form, by

Section 56 of the LDO. The procedure as to submitting and the

WRT/0021/24

Page 6 of 10

registration is then provided for by Rule 148 of the Land Manual, which

states as follows:

148. ,

.

.

.

.

9. According to the above, the nomination or cancellation is required to be

effected during the lifetime of the owner or the permit holder. The

registration referred to therein is the registration in the relevant Land

Registry. The said Rule also provides that if the permit is yet to be

registered, an entry should be made in the relevant land ledger and also

in the original copy of the permit. It also provides that when taking

action in respect to succession, the officers are required to act with due

diligence and without delay. Accordingly, it appears that upon the

perfection of the relevant application for nomination in the prescribed

form, the same is then handed over to the relevant Divisional Secretary.

It then appears that the Divisional Secretariat effects the necessary

registration by sending it to the relevant Land Registry. The sum total is

that the original owner has, in fact, tendered the nomination on the

prescribed form on 09.10.2020, which is annexed as P-9. According to

P-9, the 4th respondent and the petitioner have been nominated for

succession in respect of 20 and 60 perches, which constitutes the total

extent of 2 roods.

10. The obligation to determine the succession is a matter to be decided by

the 1st respondent Divisional Secretary. The Divisional Secretary,

notwithstanding having held two inquiries, had not determined the issue

WRT/0021/24

Page 7 of 10

of succession. However, on 09.10.2023 certain observations had been

made as aforesaid. Then subsequently on 27.11.2023, the 1st

respondent decides to inform the parties to have this matter sorted out

by referring the same to a competent Court. The end result is that the

Divisional Secretary has not made a decision as to succession by virtue

of the provisions of the LDO. It is incumbent upon the Divisional

Secretary to consider this matter and make a determination. In this

instance, the 1st respondent Divisional Secretary has not exercised and

has failed to perform his duty to so determine. Correspondingly, the

petitioner has a right to have this matter determined by the Divisional

Secretary. He had made a request to the Divisional Secretary. It is settled

law that the refusal to decide will be amenable to a writ of mandamus

and such officer may be directed to perform the same.

11. Two matters arise for the consideration of this Court, Firstly, the failure

to register the nomination, and secondly, the determination of the

succession and the successors. I will first consider the former.

Failure to register the nomination.

12. As narrated above, and clearly evident from documents P-8, P-9, and

P-12, the nomination had been made. However, there had been no

registration due to the lapse and negligence of the Divisional Secretary

and the Secretariat. Padman Surasena, J. (P/CA), (as His Lordship then

was) in Rathnayaka Mudiyanselage Ranbanda vs. Mahaweli

Authority of Sri Lanka and four others, CA/WRT/267/2013 (C.A.M.

26.07.2018), held as follows:

It is to be noted that the nomination had been made by the

Petitioner's father before his death. It is just that the relevant

officials had not taken steps to have it registered immediately. The

responsibility to ensure the due registration of the nomination is

with the public authority. Due to the lapses on the part of the public

authority, the said nomination has been registered after demise of

the Petitioner's father.

WRT/0021/24

Page 8 of 10

It is relevant for this Court to note at this stage that the Supreme

Court in the case of Mallehe Vidaneralalage Don Dayaratne vs.

Divisional Secretary of Thamankaduwa, Polonnaruwa and

four others, SC Appeal No. 30/2004 decided on 23.03.2005, has

stressed the importance of giving effect to the wish of the deceased

holder.

In the abovementioned case of Dayaratne vs. Divisional Secretary of

Thamankaduwa, His Lordship S. N. Silva, C.J., held as follows:

In these circumstances, we are of the view that the 1st respondent

has made the order P7 on a proper application of the relevant

provisions and importantly, by giving effect to the wish of the

deceased allottee. Our attention has also been drawn to a

judgement of the Court of Appeal in Piyasena vs. Wijesinghe and

others (2002) 2 SLR 242 where the Court of Appeal has taken the

same view that on the basis that there is a lacuna in the law and

that the intention of the allottee should be given effect to.

13. What is glaring and apparent is the fact that due to the lapse and

negligence or extreme remissness on the part of a public officer, the

nomination has not been registered prior to the demise of the owner of

the grant (grandmother of the petitioner). This had come to light only

when the petitioner participated at the inquiry held by the 1st

respondent. The owner has done everything required to be fulfilled by

her to effect the nomination, as required by the LDO. In these

circumstances, the petitioner and the 4th respondent who are the

nominees, cannot be prejudiced or denied the benefit and right they

ought to have derived and are entitled to, by virtue of such nomination.

The said nomination reflected in P-9 is the clear intention of the original

owner. Provisions of Section 58 and 60 of the LDO are now relevant.

Section 58 provides that a document whereby a nomination of a

successor is effected shall not be valid unless it has been registered.

WRT/0021/24

Page 9 of 10

Correspondingly, Section 60 provides as follows: No nomination or

cancellation of the nomination of a successor shall be valid unless the

document (other than a last will) effecting such nomination or cancellation

is duly registered before the date of the death of the owner of the holding

or the permit-holder.

14. The cumulative effect of Sections 58 and 60 is that a document by

which the nomination of a successor is made would be valid only if such

nomination is made in the prescribed form and is duly registered before

the death of the owner or the permit holder. In the present application,

the owner died on 21.05.2022. The registration of the nomination had

not been made before that date. On a plain reading, the effect and the

import is that the document by which the nomination is made in this

application will not be valid. I observe that these provisions are akin to

the provisions of the Registration of Documents, which require the

registration of certain documents pertaining to land. Primarily, this is

provided to ensure others of the existence of a nomination, and may also

be to afford some form of priority, if there be a subsequent nomination

made and registered. Be that as it may, the owner has certainly made a

nomination by P-9. The affidavit P-8 clearly states the object and

intention for this nomination. Therefore, without doubt, it is apparent

that the owner Kumarihami had clearly intended, for good reason, to

nominate the petitioner and the 4th respondent as successors.

15. That being so, once the said nomination is tendered to the Divisional

Secretary, there was a duty and an obligation upon such officer to

forward it to the relevant Land Registry and cause it to be registered. As

held by Justice Surasena, J., (P/CA) (as he then was) in Rathnayaka

Mudiyanselage Ranbanda vs. Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka and

four others, CA/WRT/267/2013 (supra), it is the responsibility of the

relevant officer to ensure the due registration of the said nomination.

This obligation to take steps without delay is incorporated in Rule 148

of the Land Manual as well. In these circumstances, I hold that once the

WRT/0021/24

Page 10 of 10

perfected papers for nomination are submitted, such owner or permit

holder is entitled to expect the same to be duly submitted for registration

and registered without delay. Correspondingly, the acceptance of the

duly completed nomination papers by the Divisional Secretary amounts

to a holding out that the same will be duly registered without delay. If

there be a lapse on the part of the Divisional Secretary or any other, the

owners intent and the nominees rights cannot be denied or prejudiced

thereby. In the circumstances of this application, especially in view of

the clear admission by the Divisional Secretary of his lapse and in the

absence of any other subsequent competing nomination or registration

of a subsequent nomination, I hold that upon the tendering of the papers

for nomination, it ought to be deemed that the same had been so

registered in due course. This will then be well before the date of death

of the owner in this application.

16. In the above premises, I hold that the petitioner is entitled to the relief

as prayed for by prayer (e) of the petition. Accordingly, a writ of

mandamus is issued, directing the 1st respondent to take steps to

register the nomination made by P-9, and the same to be registered with

an endorsement that the said nomination is registered with effect from

01.11.2020. Upon so effecting the said registration, the 1st respondent

is further directed to determine the succession giving due consideration

to the nomination made by P-9 upon holding an inquiry. The application

of the petitioner is accordingly allowed to that extent. However, I make

no order as to costs.

17. Application is allowed.
