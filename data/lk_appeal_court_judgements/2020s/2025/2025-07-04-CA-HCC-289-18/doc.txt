JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as "the Accused") was indicted

before the High Court of Colombo for the possession of 4.69 grams of heroin

Page 3 of 8

To support the charge, the prosecution called three witnesses and tendered

productions marked P1 to P8 before closing its case. The Accused subsequently

made a dock statement. After the trial, the Learned Trial Judge found the Accused

guilty and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment.

Dissatisfied with the said judgment and sentence, the Accused has preferred this

appeal.

The following are the Grounds of Appeal set out in the written submission:

1. The learned Trial Judge failed to appreciate that there is a discrepancy about

the production registry belonging to the productions of this case.

2. The learned Trial Judge failed to consider the version of the appellant.

3. The learned Trial Judge failed to appreciate that the version of the prosecution

fails the test of probability.

Prosecution version

On 11th December 2008, Police Constable No. 50151 (PW6), attached to the Panadura-

Walana Anti-Corruption Unit, received credible intelligence from his personal informant

regarding an individual who had allegedly gone to obtain heroin. The informant further

advised that if officers arrived in Peliyagoda before the suspects return, a successful raid

could be carried out. PW6 recorded this information in his pocketbook and promptly

conveyed it to PW1.

Accordingly, a team led by PW01, along with PW06 and other officers 12455,

38872, 63454, 40642, and 762266 departed in a vehicle bearing registration

number 257-3073 to execute the raid. One officer was in uniform and armed, while

the others were dressed in civilian attire. The team carried two pistols. Upon

arriving at Thorana Junction, PW1 and PW6 left the van and proceeded to the

location where the informant was stationed. After waiting for a short period, a bus

arrived. The informant then pointed out the accused to the officers before

departing the scene.

The accused was walking toward Wanawasala Road when the officers initially

allowed him to proceed. They then followed him from beind, grabbed his hand ,

Page 4 of 8

and brought him and stopped him. Upon identifying themselves as officers from

the Walana Anti-Corruption Unit, the Accused appeared visibly fearful and began

to tremble. A subsequent search of his left trouser pocket revealed a Nokia mobile

phone and his national identity card. In his right trouser pocket, officers

discovered a grocery bag containing a light brown powdery substance, which they

suspected to be heroin. He was taken into custody at approximately 13:55 hours,

and the team departed the scene around 14:10 hours. The team proceeded to the

Peliyagoda Police Station, arriving there at 14:20 hours.

At the Peliyagoda Police Station, the substance was weighed using an electronic

scale, recording a total weight of 31g 400mg, including the cellophane wrapping.

The parcel was sealed with the personal seal of PW6 and handed over to Police

Sergeant, Indrathissa No. 53368 on the same day.

During the cross-examination, the Defence counsel argued that the Accused

typically does not wear T-shirts. It was further suggested that the accused had

been apprehended around 10:45 hours and handed over to the Peliyagoda Police

Station by 12:45 hours an assertion denied by the witness. The Defence also

contested the location of the arrest; however, Witness 1 (PW1) remained resolute

in his testimony.

The Counsel alleged that an individual named Jayathissa was the person actually

arrested. They additionally claimed that the Accused was taken into custody while

en route to visit his grandmother on a motorbike. Witness No.1 was repeatedly

questioned about the sealing process and acknowledged that it was carried out by

Witness No.O6, Lal Kumara, as he did not have his seal at the time. He further

confirmed the chain of custody by affirming that he kept possession of the

production until it was handed over at the Peliyagoda Police Station.

PW1 further stated that after the raid concluded, the production items and the

Accused were officially handed over at 15:05 hours at the Peliyagoda Police

Station. However, there was a delay of approximately three hours before their

Page 5 of 8

arrival at the station. When asked about this delay, PW1 attributed it to heavy

traffic on the ColomboKandy road and a short tea break taken en route.

The testimony of Prosecution Witness No.01 is considered both credible and

trustworthy. This assessment is supported by a thorough examination of the

sequence of eventsranging from the initial receipt of information and the

execution of the raid to the timing and location of the arrest, the subsequent

transport to the Peliyagoda Police Station, and the proper sealing of the

production. As such, there exists no justifiable reason to dispute the conclusion

reached by the Learned High Court Judge.

The testimony of PW6, Lal Kumara, lends further support to PW1s testimony.

PW6 stated that upon receiving intelligence from his informant, he relayed this

information to his superior officer, PW1, and subsequently joined the team led by

PW1 to conduct the raid. He described the arrest of the Accused by PW1 and the

recovery of the incriminating substance with assurance and precision. According

to PW6, a Nokia mobile phone and an identity card were recovered from the

accuseds left trouser pocket, while a grocery bag containing a powdery substance

was retrieved from the right trouser pocket.

He also detailed the packaging of the seized item and later identified the parcel

during the trial as the parcel that contained production.

After the arrest, the accused was handed over to the Police station. Since PW1

lacked his own seal, the parcel was sealed using PW6s seal and subsequently

entrusted to Police Sergeant No. 53368 at the Peliyagoda Police Station by

entering the production registry. He has explained the discrepancy with regard to

the production registry. The learned trial judge has accepted the reason given by

this witness.

Upon perusing the evidence of PW06, his testimony corroborates the evidence of

PW01. Furthermore, we note no material contradictions between the testimonies

of PW1 and PW6 that would cast doubt on their credibility.

Page 6 of 8

We are mindful that our Courts as affirmed by the Court of Appeal, uphold the

presumption that the Learned Trial Judgehaving observed the witnesses during

examination-in-chief and cross-examinationwas well placed to assess their credibility,

benefiting from firsthand impressions of their demeanor and deportment throughout the

Trial."

The function of an appellate court in dealing with a judgment mainly

on the facts from the court, which saw and heard witnesses has been

specified as follows by Macdonnel CJ in the King v. Gunaratne and

Another, CLR V.14 page 144, Macdonnel CJ:

This is an appeal mainly on facts from a Court which saw and heard

the witnesses to a Court which has not seen or heard them, and in

dealing with this judgment I have to apply the three tests, as they

seem to be, which a Court of Appeal must apply to an appeal coming to

it on questions of fact. Can we say that the verdict of the learned

District Judge, namely, that these people are guilty, was

unreasonably. against the, weight of the evidence adduced on both

sides? Clearly it is not possible to say that. Can we say that there

has been any misdirection either on the law or on the evidence? Again

I do not think it would be possible to say so. There was a point of

law argued here that accused had no intention to cause loss in the

end. I have dealt with that, and properly understood, I do not think

it is a misdirection in law at all. I do not remember any other point

that was seriously raised to this Court as a misdirection, Them there

is the third ground of interference, that the Court of trial has drawn

the wrong inferences from matter in evidence which is as much before this

Court as. it. was before the Court of trial, for instance,

documents. Again, I do not think it can be said that there has been

any wrong inferences drawn by the Court of trial. On the contrary, the

documents put in seem, rightly apprehended, to support the findings of fact

arrived at by the learned District Judge.

Page 7 of 8

He held further: The principles laid down by the authorities, referred to

above, make it clear: that, although the findings of a Magistrate on

questions of fact are entitled to great weight, yet, it is the duty of the

Appellate Court to test, both intrinsically and extrinsically the

evidence led at the trial: that, if after a close and careful

examination of such evidence, the Appellate Court entertains a strong

doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the Appellate Court must give

the accused the benefit of such doubt.

Applying the above legal principle, and having already analyzed the testimonies

of PW1 and PW6, we are satisfied that the Learned Trial Judge has correctly

evaluated the evidence of both witnesses and reached a justifiable conclusion that

their accounts are truthful and consistent. There is no basis to disregard or

disbelieve this finding. Furthermore, it is observed that Counsel for the Accused-

Appellant failed to establish any contradictions or inconsistencies between the

testimonies of these two witnesses.

In light of this, there is no justification to reject the evidence on such grounds.

Nothing has been presented that would undermine the credibility or

trustworthiness of the said witnesses. We are, therefore, of the view that the

Learned High Court Judge rightly found both witnesses to be reliable. Their

evidence concerning the arrest of the Accused and the recovery of the productions

was coherent and dependable.

One of the objections raised by the Accused is that the Learned Trial Judge failed

to give proper consideration to the dock statement made by the Accused. According

to the Accused, he was arrested at around 10:30 hours. However, both PW1 and

PW6 stated they received relevant information only around 12:30 hours. and

proceeded thereafter to apprehend the Accused. The out-entry of PW1 confirms

that the officers left the police station after 13:00 hours, and the timing reflected

in the production register further corroborates this sequence of events. Thus, the

version provided by the Accused cannot be accepted.

Page 8 of 8

While we acknowledge that under certain circumstances a dock statement may

raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecutions case entitling the Accused to an

acquittal we find, in this instance, that the dock statement made by the Appellant

does not give rise to any such doubt. Consequently, we find no merit in the grounds

advanced by the Learned Counsel for the Appellant.

Taking all the aforementioned matters into account, we find no reason to interfere

with the judgment of the Learned Trial Judge.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, and the conviction and sentence imposed on

the Appellant are affirmed.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
