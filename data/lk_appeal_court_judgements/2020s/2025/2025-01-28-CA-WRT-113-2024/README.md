JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Petitioner instituted this application by the petition dated 11.07.2023 seeking inter

alia a writ of Certiorari to quash the decision dated 01.03.2023 marked P5 on the basis

that the said order was signed only by one person and a writ of Mandamus to compel the

2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents to consider the possession of the Petitioner in terms of the

law.

The relevant facts of this case are as follows:

The Petitioner states that the Petitioner became the owner of the land in question by the

deed bearing No. 1760 dated 20.09.2000 attested by I.G. Munasinghe, Notary Public. The

Petitioner further states that the Petitioner filed an application in the Debt Conciliation

Board dated 19.09.2012. After such application, the Petitioner was directed to prove the

possession according to which the Petitioner marked several documents and several

parties gave evidence.

Through evidence, the Petitioner revealed that he was in possession when the application

was made to the Debt Conciliation Board and that in the police complaint, the applicant

specifically prayed not to enter into the possession till the determination of the matter

but on or around 23.10.2015, the Respondent forcibly entered into the land and started a

car sale. Further, the Grama Niladhari certificate confirmed the possession of the

applicant. The Petitioner further avers that the Board delivered its order on 12.07.2019

and decided in terms of Sections 19(2) and 19(aa) (1) (2) of the Debt Conciliation Board

that the Petitioner is in possession of the land. Being aggrieved by the said order, the 5th

Respondent filed a writ application bearing No. 152/21. The Court of Appeal made an

order dated 21.10.2022 quashing the decision made on 12.07.2019 directing the Board to

consider all the evidence led before it and make an appropriate order. The Petitioner avers

that thereafter, the order dated 01.03.2023 marked P5 was made inter alia deciding that

the burden is on the applicant to prove the possession as at the date of application, the

Grama Niladhari did not confirm the type of possession of the applicant and the deed

marked 8313 is executed as a security for the money borrowed from the 5th Respondent.

The Petitioner contends that the said order marked P5 is made and signed only by the 2nd

Respondent which is contrary to Section 3 of the Debt Conciliation Board and thus ultra

vires.

In this context, the Petitioner has invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court seeking inter

alia to quash the said order marked P5.

When we peruse P5, it is true that the particular order was signed by the Chairman of

the Board. Nevertheless, after a careful perusal of the order, the following excerpt can be

considered as important.

.

.

Further, we observe that on page 243 of the brief, before the said order was made on

01.03.2023, at 9.30, the Chairman, and one of the Members named Tillakaratne were

present when the order was pronounced.

During the argument stage, the Counsel for the Respondents brought to the notice of the

Court of the Debt Conciliation Regulations with regard to the necessity of quorum.

According to Section 7 (a) of the said regulation, there is no necessity for all the members

to be present for an inquiry. Therefore, we hold that, the order delivered on 01.03.2023 is

in accordance with the law. Thus, there is no reason for this Court to quash the said Order.

We dismiss the application with costs of Rs. 50,000/-.
