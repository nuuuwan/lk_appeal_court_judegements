JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Kegalle for

committing one count of grave sexual abuse on the victim Palle Gedera

Induwari Samithma Wijetunga, punishable under Section 365(B) 2 (b) of the

Penal Code as amended by Acts No.29 of 1998 and No.16 of 2016.

The trial commenced on 27.03.2019 and after leading all necessary

witnesses, the prosecution had closed the case on 24/09/2020. The Learned

High Court Judge had called for the defence on the same day and the

Counsel for the Appellant had moved for a day to call witnesses on his behalf.

The Appellant had made a dock statement and closed his case on

02.11.2020.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the evidence presented by

both parties, convicted the Appellant as charged under Section 365(B) (2) (b)

of the Penal Code as amended, and sentenced the Appellant to 15 years

rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs.10,000/- subject to a

default sentence of 06 months simple imprisonment. No compensation was

ordered by the learned High Court Judge.

CA/HCC/0043/21

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

had given consent to argue this matter in his absence. The Appellant was

connected via Zoom from prison during the argument.

The following grounds of appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant

at the argument.

1. Whether the prosecution proved the case beyond reasonable doubt on

the basis that the material witness was not called to give evidence.

2. Whether the contradiction marked as V1 was considered in the correct

perspective.

3. The probability of the incident.

Background of the case albeit as follows:

In this case the victim was less than five years old when she faced this

abominable violation. According to PW1, in the evening of the day of the

incident, the victim was standing close to her father while her father was

having a bath. At that time, the Appellant who is a known to the victim had

arrived and the victims father had asked the her to go home as she was

getting wet from the water splashing on her from his bath. As such, the

Appellant carried the victim to her house and placed her on the bed.

Thereafter, the Appellant had removed the undergarment of the victim up to

her knee. Simultaneously, the Appellant too had lowered his trouser and his

undergarment and rubbed his penis on the victims vagina.

While the Appellant was on the victims body, PW3, the brother of the victim

had arrived and reprimanded the Appellant. Thereafter, he had informed the

incident to his father. According to the victim her father had assaulted the

Appellant at that time. Thereafter, PW1 had first told the incident to her

grandmother Seelawathi. A maid namely Ranjani was employed at the

victims house. Even though Ranjani was the first person to lodge the

complaint with the police, she was not called to give evidence at the trial.

According to PW3, the brother of the victim, he himself had witnessed the

Appellant lying on top of her sisters body and committing intercrural sex.

Further, when he shouted, the victim had run up to PW2 Ranjani and

recounted the incident to her.

The JMO had examined the victim on 11/05/2013 at the Base Hospital,

Mawanella. In the history, the victim had stated that a known person had

attempted to touch her inappropriately and had removed her clothes while

she was home. The victim had not revealed any vaginal, or oral penetration.

The Medico legal Report, except the history, was admitted under Section 420

of the Code of Criminal Procedure act No.15 of 1979 by the defence.

As the grounds of appeal raised by the Appellant are interconnected, all

grounds will be considered together in this appeal.

In the indictment filed by the prosecution, it had only referred to the act of

intercrural sex committed on the victim by the Appellant. But when the

victim was giving evidence before the High Court, she restricted her evidence

to the act of the Appellant rubbing his penis on her vagina. Further, in the

history to the doctor the victim had not revealed any sexual act committed

by the Appellant.

In a case of this nature, the testimonial trustworthiness and credibility of

PW1, mainly the probability should be assessed with utmost care and

caution by the Trial Judge. The learned Trial Judge has to satisfy and accept

the evidence of a child witness after assessing his/her competence and

credibility as a witness.

CA/HCC/0043/21

5 | P a g e

In Ranjeet Kumar Ram v. State of Bihar [2015] SCC Online SC 500 the

court held that:

Evidence of the child witness and its credibility would depend upon the

circumstances of each case. Only precaution which the court has to bear

in mind while assessing the evidence of a child witness is that the

witness must be a reliable one.

Considering the above cited judicial decision, as the credibility of the

evidence of a child witness would depend on the circumstances of each case,

it is the duty of the Learned Trial Judge to assess and decide on the evidence

given by child witness.

The learned Counsel drew the attention to the history narrated to the doctor

by the victim. In her history she had stated that a known person had

attempted to touch her and remove her clothes while she was at home. In

the history to the doctor the victim had not mentioned any sexual act

committed on her by the Appellant. But in her evidence, she had said that

the Appellant had rubbed his penis on her vagina. Hence the Counsel argued

that the evidence given by the victim is not consistent with her history to the

doctor.

The basic foundation in a criminal trial is the charge. By charging, an

accused is provided information as to the nature of the allegation levelled

against him. The charge must identify the act committed by the accused, the

law alleged to have been violated by him and it should also specify particulars

pertaining to the alleged offence.

It is the profound duty of a prosecutor to frame the charge/s after careful

consideration of evidence available in the case at the time of drafting the

charge. The requirements of a valid charge are set out in Sections 164 and

165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

CA/HCC/0043/21

6 | P a g e

In this case, although the Appellant had been charged for intercrural sex,

the victim had given evidence that the Appellant had rubbed his penis on her

vagina. Further, at the doctors, she had not mentioned any sexual act

committed by the Appellant. The defence had not admitted the history given

to the doctor under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

Therefore, I conclude that this has caused great prejudice to the Appellant.

According to the victim she had informed first the grandmother and then the

domestic aid Ranjani of the alleged act of abuse. The prosecution had not

called any of them to give evidence in the trial. Even though Ranjani had

lodged the first complaint at the police, she was not called to give evidence.

Essential witnesses in a criminal trial are those individuals who possess

crucial firsthand information about the crime, directly linking the defendant

to the alleged crime and whose testimony is considered vital for the

prosecution to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.

In King v. Seneviratne 38 NLR 208 the Court held that:

Witnesses essential to the unfolding of the narrative on which the

prosecution is based must be called by the prosecution, whether in the

result the effect of their testimony is for or against the case for the

prosecution.

Witness evidence can even be acted upon without corroboration where no

inhibition or unreliability has been attached or suggested against such

testimony.

In this case PW02, Ranjani is an essential witness to corroborate the

evidence given by the victim regarding the act of abuse. She is essential as

she is the one who lodged the first complaint to the police.

CA/HCC/0043/21

His Lordship Justice Dheeraratne in Sunil and others v. Attorney General

[1986] 1 S. L. R 230 held that:

Corroboration is only required or afforded if the witness requiring

corroboration is otherwise credible. If the evidence of witness

requiring corroboration is not credible his testimony should be

rejected and the accused acquitted. Seeking corroboration of a

witnesss evidence should not be used as a process of inducing

belief in such evidence where such evidence is not credible.

It is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of a

woman victim of a sex offence but if her evidence is convincing such

evidence could be acted on even the absence of corroboration.

In Premasiri v. Attorney General [2006] 3 Sri.L.R held that:

The rule is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a

conviction in a case of rape but the necessity of corroboration as a

matter of prudence except where the circumstances make it unsafe

to dispense with it, must be present to the mind of the judge.

In State of Andra Pradesh v. Garigula Satya Vani Murty AIR 1997 SC

1588, it was held that:

the courts are expected to show great responsibility while tying an

accused on a charge of rape. They must deal with such cases with

utmost sensitivity.

Considering the evidence given by the victim, her evidence is not

corroborated by very important witness PW2, who heard the victims story

first. As such the victim had failed to satisfy the court on the test of

consistency, spontaneity and probability.

CA/HCC/0043/21

8 | P a g e

The learned Counsel contended that the learned High Court Judge had failed

to take into consideration the material contradictions in the evidence of PW3

who was called to give evidence in order to corroborate the evidence of the

victim. PW3 is the brother of the victim. In his evidence it was revealed that

he had failed to tell the Police about the incident as witnessed by him. Hence,

he gave evidence pertaining to the incident for the very first time directly in

courts. He admitted that he did not tell the police as he gave evidence before

the High Court. Defence had marked a vital contradiction as V1. This

contradiction certainly attacks the root of the matter and provides a strong

challenge to the prosecution version.

The book Sarkar on Evidence, 15th Edition at page 112 states:

Minor discrepancies are possible, even in the version of truthful

witnesses and such minor discrepancies only add to the truthfulness of

their evidence. [Sidhan v. State of Kerela [1986] Cri LJ 470,

473(Kerala)]. But discrepancies in the statements of witnesses on

material points should not be passed over, as they seriously affect the

value of their testimony (Brijlal v.Kunwar, 36A 187: 18CWN 649:

A1914PC38).The main thing to be seen is whether the inconsistencies

go to the root of the matter or pertain to insignificant aspects thereof. In

the former case, the defence may be justified in seeking advantage of the

incongruities obtained in the evidence. In the latter, however, no such

benefit will be available to it. (Krishna Pillai Sree Kumar v. State of

Kerala A [1981] SC 1237,1239).

In The Attorney General v Sandanam Pitchai Mary Theresa [2011] 2 SLR

292 the court held that:

Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect

the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that

the Court must exercise its judgment on the nature of the inconsistency

or contradiction and whether they are true material to the facts in issue.

CA/HCC/0043/21

9 | P a g e

In this case PW1, and PW3 are the key witnesses. Their evidence is not clear

and not matched on material points discussed above. Their evidence is

tainted with much ambiguity and uncertainty which definitely affects the

root of the case. This has aggravated more due to not calling an essential

witness PW2.

Taking into consideration, all these circumstances, I am of the view that the

conviction of the Appellant cannot be allowed to stand as the prosecution

had failed its duty to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt. I set aside

the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge of

Kegalle dated 05/04/2021 on the Appellant. Therefore, he is acquitted from

this case.

Therefore, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Kegalle along with the original case record.
