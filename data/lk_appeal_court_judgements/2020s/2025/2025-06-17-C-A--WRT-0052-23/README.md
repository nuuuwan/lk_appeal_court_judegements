whereby oral submissions were made on behalf of all parties. Then, the Court

submissions.

FACTUAL MATRIX;

The Petitioner by its own admission is a firm engaged in the provision of

consultancy services in the fields of urban development, public infrastructure

development, water and sanitation, environmental matters, and other socio-

economic sectors.

The Petitioner entered into a Consultancy Agreement X3 with the Road

Development Authority (RDA), in terms of which the Petitioner was retained to

provide consultancy services to the RDA. Under X3, the Petitioner was contracted

5

to supervise construction works undertaken by contractors. In terms of X3, the

Petitioner and Ocyana Consultants (Pvt) Ltd agreed to provide a range of

consultancy services for COLOMBO NATIONAL HIGHWAY PROJECT which

included the widening and rehabilitation of Orugodawatta-Ambatale road. The

contractors for this project were Tudawe Brothers and Komuthi, two leading civil

contracting Companies totally unconnected with the Petitioner.

In fulfillment of its obligations under X3, the Petitioner engaged the 4th

respondent as Technical Officer in July 2017 where he was thereafter assigned

to the site offices of Komuthi-HOM Engineering and Tudawe Brothers (Pvt) Ltd,

two contractors whose work the Petitioner was contractually bound to supervise.

By the letter dated 31.05.2021 (X6), the Petitioner informed the 4th respondent

that his services would not be required beyond 30thJune 2021 and requested to

complete all outstanding work prior to the said date.

Subsequently, the 4th respondent lodged a complaint X7(b) with the Department

of Labour, alleging that the Petitioner had failed to remit the Employee Provident

Fund (EPF) contributions due to him. An inquiry was conducted by the

Department of Labour and the inquiring officer concluded by the Report R1, that

the 4th respondent was, in fact, an employee of the Petitioner and was therefore

entitled to EPF contributions from the Petitioner.

6

THE PETITIONERS POSITION:

The Petitioner argues that the 4th Respondent is not an employee of the Petitioner

and the Petitioner is not his employer due to the following reasons;

a) Payment of "Consultancy fees" based on the invoices furnished by the 4th

Respondent himself. X5(1)" (Vide page 53 of the brief) to "X5(38)".

b) Time sheets recommended by the Resident Engineer and certified by the

Team

Leader "X5A (1)" to "X5 A (48)" (Vide page 91 of the brief)

c) Payments made by the G.H.R. Development (Pvt) Limited that manages

Petitioner's payments to Independent Contractors.

d) 4th Respondent never worked at Petitioner's office.

e) The 4th Respondent provided services at offices of the said two contractors.

Komuthi and Tudawe Brother's, in respect of widening and improvement

or Orugodawatta-Ambatale Road. These two organizations were the

contractors on this project.

f) He got directions from those contractors and Petitioner did not issue

directions to the 4th Respondent as to the provision of his services at those

sites.

g) 4th Respondent used his own equipment.

h) 4th Respondent was free to provide his services as an Independent

Contractor to any party.

7

i) No Letter of Appointment issued to the Petitioner

The sole contention advanced by the Petitioner is that 4th Respondent was

engaged as an Independent Contractor. Following contentions were advanced by

the Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner:

1. The 4th respondent as an Independent Contractor was engaged as a

Technical Officer from July 2017 to June 2021 for the widening and

rehabilitation of Orugodawatta-Ambatale road which was part of the

COLOMBO NATIONAL HIGHWAY PROJECT.

2. Before obtaining the services of the 4th respondent for the project, the

Petitioner sought and obtained the approval of the RDA in terms of X4(a)

and X4(b).

3. In X4(a), the position of the 4th respondent has been identified as the

Technical Officer.

4. Under the heading Staffing in Clause 12 of X3, the details of the

personnel required for project has been set out. It shows two categories

of staff, namely, key professional staff and other professional staff,

whereas the technical officers falling to the latter category of other

professional staff. Hence, the 4th respondent was not part of the key

professional staff of the project.

5. Attention was drawn to the CV of the 4th respondent, X4(c) which reveals

that he was 69 or 70 years old when he was engaged as a Technical

Officer; thus, when the 4th respondents services were obtained, he has

well passed the retirement age.

8

6. After he left State Service, namely the Central Provincial Council in year

2000, he has carried out short term assignments with various private

sector organizations, and each such assignment does not exceed more

than more than 3 years. Except one, all other assignments involved, road

development projects funded by international donor agencies.

7. Moreover, all these assignments have been done for companies providing

consultancy services, like that of the Petitioner. On six separate occasions,

the 4th respondent had short term work assignments with the same

company, namely MG Consultants (Pvt) Limited

8. Above per se establishes that the 4th respondent never had permanent

employment since he left State service and worked on ad hoc

assignments with different entities, providing consultancy services, even

prior to being engaged on this assignment as a Technical Officer.

9. The 4th respondent made a subsequent complaint X26(b) to the Labour

Department representing that Komuthi was his employer and sought

Gratuity against them. X26(b) reveals that a third party-Komuthi who

was one of the contractors is named as the employer by the 4th respondent

in claiming gratuity. The 4th respondent has claimed that his

employment with Komuthi commenced on 15.07.2017 which coincide

with the Petitioner engaging his services. It was submitted that X26(b)

establishes as the 4th respondent was engaged as a Technical Officer in

9

the capacity of an Independent Contractor-he was free to provide his

services to others as well and in fact, did so as established by X26(b)

10. At the inquiry held pursuant to X26(b) before the 1st respondent on

08.02.2023, the Complainant confirmed that his complaint was not

against the Petitioner, but against Komuthi HCM in respect of non-

payment of Overtime for 2018 and 2019. Thereupon, the 1st respondent

who conducted inquiry informed the Petitioners representative that he is

not required at this inquiry as the complaint is not against the Petitioner.

In this regard, paragraph 11(d) of the Objections of 4th respondent states

as follows: Over-time payment was paid by Komuthi-HOM

Engineering Joint Venture while Tuduwe Brothers (Pvt) Ltd did not pay

any overtime payment. (emphasis added)

11. By his Statement of Objections, the 4th respondent has admitted that one

of the contractors-Komuthi has paid him overtime payment. It was

submitted that the 4th respondent who alleges to be an

employee/workman cannot have two employers; this admission of the 4th

respondent that Komuthi was employer corroborates the Petitioners

position.

12. As revealed from the invoices produced as X5(1) to X5(38), the 4th

respondent has been paid Consultancy fees based on the invoices

furnished by the 4th respondent himself.

13. A close perusal of an invoice (vide X5(1)) reveals that, at the top left of the

same, the 4th respondents name is there, and below his name and word

10

Bill to is there, followed by the Petitioners name and its address. At the

bottom of the invoice, the 4th respondents name and signature appears,

followed by payment instructions, specifying payment to be made to his

HNB Account.

14. Attention was drawn to the definition of the term invoice as contained in

page 904 of the Blacks Law Dictionary (Ninth Edition):

Invoice, n. (14C) An itemized list of goods or services furnished by the

seller to a buyer, specifying the price and terms of sale.(emphasis

added)

15. By issuing invoices, the 4th respondent has billed the Petitioner

Consultancy fees in respect of the services he provided for the project.

This payment mechanism is completely different to a payment

mechanism adopted in respect of an employee. In respect of an employee,

the employer merely pays a salary and issues a salary slip, and the same

does not involve any billing by the employee to the employer.

16. As revealed by X15, these consultancy fees have been paid to the 4th

respondent not by the Petitioner, but by the G.H.R. Development (Pvt)

Limited that manages Petitioners payments to Independent Contractors.

This follows that the term Consultancy Fee is no way a mere label

unilaterally used by the Petitioner to disguise a purported employer-

employee relationship it had with the 4th respondent. This payment

mechanism demonstrates that the 4th respondent was engaged as a

Technical Officer only in the capacity of an Independent Contractor.

11

17. In most months in a year, same figures have been billed to the

Petitioner as Consultancy Fees by the 4th respondent, which has

been subject to an increase of 10% in years 2018, 2020 and 2021.

However, it was submitted that this does not make such payment a

salary, as unlike a monthly salary, this fee has been billed to the

Petitioner by the 4th respondent via invoices.

18. Time sheets recommended by the Resident Engineer and certified by the

Team Leader, X5A (1) to X5A (48), 4th respondent never worked at

Petitioners office. He provided services at offices of the two contractors,

Komuthi and Tudawe Brothers in respect of widening and improvement

of Orugodawatta-Ambatale Road. He got directions from those

contractors and Petitioner did not issue directions to the 4th respondent

as to the provision of his services at those sites.

19. 4th respondent was provided with the equipment and other facilities by

the Civil work Contractors of the project in terms of the Clause 14 under

the heading, facilities in X3.

20. 4th respondent was free to provide his services as an Independent

Contractor to any party, and admittedly has provided services to

Komuthi.

21. No letter of appointment issued to the Petitioner.

22. By X6 under the caption Completion of Consultancy Services, the

Petitioner informed the 4th respondent that his services as a Consultant

Technical Officer will not be required beyond 30th June 2021. It is clear

12

from the contents of X6, it is not a termination letter issued to an

employee as it merely states that the 4th respondents services are not

required beyond 30th June 2021. The 4th respondent has signed and

accepted it without any protest.

23. A perusal of the subsequent complaint to the Labour Department X7(b)

reveals that no relief has been sought as to termination of employment,

and the only reliefs sought are to obtain EPF and ETF money. This per

se establishes that the 4th respondents acquiescence in law that he was

not an employee of the Petitioner as he realized he was not entitled to

reinstatement and/or compensation as he was not an employee of the

Petitioner.

The Petitioner has drawn the attention of this Court to the following Authorities:

In CA (Writ) 274/218 Colombo Municipal Council and Others vs.

Commissioner General of Labour and Others, decided on 14.10.2020 where

the Court held that, the relationship between the Colombo Municipal Council

(CMC) and the 4th Respondent, a Rate Collector of the CMC was not that of

employer-employee, but the 4th respondent was only an independent contractor of

the CMC. Hence the EPF Act is inapplicable in this instance.

In the said case, Samayawardhena J. held, inter alia, as follows:

The 1st Respondent in P26 says the 4th Respondent was part and parcel of the

CMC, which may be meant to suggest he played a pivotal role there. I am unable

13

to accept this. The services of the 4th Respondent would have been helpful to the

institution but cannot be said to have been an integral part thereof. The job of a

Rate Collector is limited to collecting rates from defaulters, that also

outside of the premises of the CMC.

In C.A. (Writ) 28/2012-Consolidated Marine Engineers vs. Assistant

Commissioner of Labour and Others decided on 29.05.2020, the Court issued

a writ of Certiorari quashing the direction to pay EPF in respect of the 4th to 6th

Respondents, who provided services as security guards on the basis that they

have failed to prove that they were employees of the Petitioner within the meaning

of the EPF Act, and hence the conclusion of the Respondents is not supported

by the evidence led at the inquiry. In holding so, Janak De Silva J. considered

the following:

a. The 4th to 6th respondents did not sign the attendance book maintained

by the Petitioner in relation to the other employees. They maintained their

own book and got it signed by the Accountant of the Petitioner;

b. Applying the integration test, there is no evidence to show that the work

done by the 4th respondent were an integral part of the business of the

Petitioner or that they are part and parcel of the Petitioner.

c. Neither is there, evidence that the 4th to 6th respondents were employees

of the Petitioner as a matter of economic reality;

14

d. It is true that the 4th to 6th respondents were issued identity cards by the

Petitioner. But the evidence taken as a whole negates any relationship of

employer-employee between the parties.

In C.A. (Writ) 628/2011, St Regis Packaging (Private) Limited vs.

Commissioner General of Labour and Others decided on 18.01.2017, the

Court issued a writ of Certiorari, quashing P2 that imposed EPF liability on the

Petitioner in respect of the 4th Respondent on the basis that the inquiry

proceedings that preceded P2 were tainted with procedural impropriety.

THE POSITION OF THE 1ST TO 3RD RESPONDENTS:

On behalf of the 1st to 3rd Respondents, following counter arguments were raised:

The first contention is that the 4th Respondent was integral to the operations of

the Petitioner Company.

1. In the ordinary course of its operations, the Petitioner enters into

consultancy agreements with third parties under which it is contractually

required to render a range of professional services. However, to perform

the technical and support functions required under these agreements, the

Petitioner recruits personal including consultants, technical officers and

administrative staff and assigns them into project sites to perform the

tasks necessary for fulfilling its contractual obligations. It is thus clear

that the services rendered are in direct furtherance of the Petitioners

obligations under consultancy agreements.

15

2. In other words, the profits the Petitioner generates is directly dependent

on the work carried out by such personnel who are engaged specifically to

implement the terms of the Consultancy Agreements.

3. This model of operating, whereby personnel are recruited and deployed for

the performance of project-specific obligations, is fundamental to the

Petitioners ability to fulfill its contractual commitments and consequently,

to earn revenue.

4. Absent the contribution of such individuals, the Petitioner would have no

means of delivering the services it is contractually bound to provide and

would be unable to generate profit.

5. Accordingly, the individuals recruited and deployed in this manner are not

peripheral but integral to the core business operations of the Petitioner. In

the circumstances, it is untenable to now assert that such personnel,

whose work is essential to the fulfillment of contractual obligations, do not

constitute employees.

6. In terms of Consultancy Agreement X3, the Petitioner is required to

supervise various contractors engaged in road construction works on

behalf of the RDA. The scope of the consultancy services expected of the

Petitioner is set out in Section E of Appendix A, titled Description of

Services/Terms of Reference.

7. Further, Section D of Appendix A provides that the Petitioner is obligated

to furnish a team of consultants for the project through the direct

engagement of individual experts, and to deploy the necessary technical

16

and administrative support staff required to carry out the

assignments entrusted to the Petitioner.

8. Specifically, paragraph 12 of Section E stipulates that the consultancy

services to be provided shall include the engagement of various categories

of domestic and support staff, which are listed in an accompanying table.

Under Section 3 of this table, titled Technical Staff, it is explicitly

stated that the Petitioner must engage Technical Officers as part of

its obligations.

9. It was furtherance of these express contractual obligations that the

Petitioner recruited the 4th Respondent as a Technical Officer. Thus, this

recruitment was not incidental or ancillary, but was a direct

requitement arising from the Petitioners obligations under X3.

10. Accordingly, the 4th respondent, along with other personnel similarly

recruited, was essential to the Petitioners ability to perform its

contractual obligations and to generate revenue therefrom. Absent such

personnel, the Petitioner would have had no means of discharging it

contractual duties.

11. In simple terms, the Petitioner was compelled to hire such as 4th

Respondent to carry out the services it had contracted to perform and

to earn a profit. As such, the 4th Respondent was an integral component

of the Petitioners operations and business model, and must therefore be

regarded as an employee of the Petitioner.

17

Regarding the control of which the Petitioner exercised over the 4th Respondent,

following submissions were made:

The degree of control exercised by the Petitioner over the 4th Respondent is

evidenced by the findings set out in the Report marked as R1.

1. The 4th Respondent became aware of vacancies for the position of

Technical Officer and applied to the Petitioner Company. Pursuant to this,

he was interviewed by Mr. D. A. Karunadasa, the Project Leader of the

Petitioner Company.

2. Following the interview, he was recruited as a Technical Officer and was

assigned to the Orugodawatta-Ambatale Road Development Project. He

was instructed to report directly to the Resident Engineer for the

Project. According to X3, the Petitioner bore the responsibility for

recruiting the Resident Engineer who was paid a monthly salary by the

Petitioner and for all purposes, functioned as an employee of the

Petitioner.

3. The 4th Respondent has worked under the direct supervision and

control of the said Resident Engineer who was responsible for

assigning tasks and monitoring the 4th Respondents performance on

a daily basis.

4. He was required to report to work daily from 8.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m.,

and was also paid overtime by the Petitioner for any work performed

more than standard working hours.

18

5. Initially, he was paid a monthly salary of 70,000 which was subject to an

annual increment of 10%. At the time of the termination of services, he

was drawing a monthly salary of Rs. 84,700/-

6. In the event he sought leave, prior approval was required either from the

Resident Engineer or the Project Leader. Any leave taken was subject to

a corresponding deduction from the 4th Respondents monthly salary.

7. The payment of his monthly salary was conditional upon the submission

of a duly signed timesheet which had to be endorsed by the Resident

Engineer and certified by the Project Leader, before being forwarded

to the Petitioners finance division for processing.

8. The payment of the full monthly salary was further subject to a

minimum work threshold, whereby he was required to have worked

either 129 hours in a month or a minimum of 24 days. This

requirement was confirmed by the Finance Manager of the Petitioner

Company.

9. As outlined above, he was recruited by the Petitioner and deployed to a

project site that required supervision in accordance with the terms of the

Consultancy Agreement.

10. While the project site belonged to the contractors of the RDA, who were

subject to such supervision, the mere fact that the site belonged to a

third party does not absolve the Petitioner of its status as the

employer. The work performed by the 4th Respondent constituted duties

the Petitioner was contractually obligated to perform under X3.

19

11. It is pertinent to note that the Resident Engineer to whom the 4th

Respondent reported, was also recruited by the Petitioner pursuant

to the same Consultancy Agreement.

12. The mere fact that the Petitioner sought concurrence of the RDA prior to

the recruitment does not alter the employer-employee relationship

between the Petitioner and the 4th Respondent. Such concurrence was

obtained pursuant to the terms of X3, solely to ensure that the RDA

was satisfied with the personnel recruited by the Petitioner.

13. In terms of paragraph 4(g) of the Petition, it is claimed that a salary was

never paid to the 4th Respondent. However, perusal of the invoices X5(1)-

X5(38) corroborate the findings of the report R1 where he was given a

uniform monthly salary which was subject to an annual increment of

10%. Had the 4th Respondent been an independent contractor there could

not have been such a uniform monthly payment.

14. Furthermore, the invoice X5(32) clearly demonstrate that his monthly

salary was reduced proportionately in respect of the leave taken by

4th Respondent.

15. The Petitioner avers that payments to the 4th Respondent were made by

G.H.R. Development (Pvt.) Ltd, which was responsible for handling the

Petitioners payment processes. However, the Petitioner also asserts that

G.H.R. Development (Pvt.) Ltd merely settled the invoices of the 4th

Respondent and that the Petitioner subsequently reimbursed G.H.R.

Development for those payments. Thus, it is evident that the actual

20

source of payment to the 4th respondent was the Petitioner. The

mere use of an intermediary to facilitates payment does not mean

that the Petitioner can resile from the fact that it was the Petitioner

who paid the salary.

16. As evidenced by Clearance Certificate Y2, the 4th Respondent was

required to complete specific tasks and return specific items upon the

termination of the services. Notably, the body of the certificate explicitly

states that, this form is to be completed by the employee and submitted to

the Team Leaders office through the Resident Engineer. Therefore, the

Petitioners own documentation recognizes and categorizes the 4th

Respondent as an employee.

THE 4TH RESPONDENTS CASE:

The 4th Respondents contention is that he was employed by the Petitioner for

the post of Technical Consultant and provided services within the framework

of being an employee of the Petitioner Company.

It was submitted to the Court that:

a. The 4th respondent was employed by the Petitioner for the construction of

Colombo National Highway Project.

b. The 4th respondents name has been submitted by the Petitioner as the

Technical Officer for prior approval by the RDA;

c. The 4th respondent had provided his curriculum vitae distinctly

representing that he was applying for the post of a Technical Officer.

21

The attention of this Court was drawn to the following:

a. The Petitioner allowed the 4th respondent to maintain his own office in

relation to the said business at the place of operation of the business;

b. He was required to work a fixed number of hours for a number of days (8

hours per day for 24 days per month) as stipulated in the terms of

Agreement;

c. Attendance and leave applied for by the 4th respondent were taken into

consideration when the monthly salary is paid;

d. In terms of clause 3.2.3 of the Agreement X3, he was refrained from

engaging in any business or professional activity which conflicts directly

or contractually to the work assigned to him;

e. Process of payment of the 4th respondent was under the control of the

Petitioner;

f. 4th respondent was considered as one of the key professional staff

members who was represented to the RDA as a potential candidate of the

technical staff.

CONCLUSION:

In the instant case, this Court must decide in which capacity the 4th Respondent

worked, viz. whether he was an independent contractor or whether he was

employed as an employee by the Petitioner.

22

In Free Lanka Trading Co Ltd vs. W L P De Mel and Commissioner of Labour

(1978) 79 (II) NLR 161, in which quotation by Lord Denning distinct an employee

with an Independent Contractor was quoted as follows:

Under a contract of service, a man was employed as a part of the business, and

his work is done as an integral part of the business; whereas under a contract for

service, his work, although done for the business is not integral into but is only an

accessory to it.

In terms of the above quotation, if the service is considered relevant to the

integral part of the business, he is considered to be a servant of the employer,

whereas if the services rendered are not considered as integral, he is considered

to be an Independent Contractor.

In the landmark case of Montral Locomotive Works and AG for Canada (1947)

7 DLR 161, followed by Perera vs. Marikkar Bawa (1989) 1 SLR 347, it was

decided that the Four-Fold Test should be applied in deciding whether the

master-servant relationship exists between the employer and employee, which

includes the tests as follows: i. Control test; (ii) Integration Test; (iii) Economic

reality test; (iv) Multiple test.

To find out as to what kind of relationship existed between the Petitioner

Company and the 4th Respondent, the said tests need to be applied and followed.

One important element in a contract of services is the payment of wages or

other remuneration between the parties.

23

In the instant case, it was contended by the Petitioner that the 4th respondent

has been paid Consultancy Fees based on the invoices marked as X5(1) to

X5(38) furnished by the 4th respondent himself. However, same figures have been

billed to the Petitioner as Consultancy Fees by the 4th respondent, which has

been subject to an increase of 10% in years 2018, 2020 and 2021.

Perusal of the invoices X5(1)-X5(38) corroborate the findings of the report R1

where the 4th respondent was given a uniform monthly payment which was

subject to an annual increment of 10%. The invoice X5(32) clearly demonstrate

that his monthly payment was reduced proportionately in respect of the leave

taken by 4th Respondent.

Admittedly, the payments to the 4th Respondent have been made by G.H.R.

Development (Pvt.) Ltd, which was responsible for handling the Petitioners

payment processes. However, the Petitioner also asserts that G.H.R.

Development (Pvt.) Ltd merely settled the invoices of the 4th Respondent and that

the Petitioner subsequently reimbursed G.H.R. Development for those payments.

Thus, it is evident that the actual source of payment to the 4th respondent

was the Petitioner. The mere use of an intermediary to facilitates payment does

not mean that the Petitioner cannot resile from the position that it was the

Petitioner who paid the payment. Merely because the fee has been billed to the

Petitioner by the 4th respondent via invoices, this cannot be considered as

consultancy fee.

24

This is not a consultancy fee paid depending on work. This goes to show

that the 4th Respondent has worked in the company for a continuous period of

4 years for a fixed monthly salary.

Regarding the degree of control exercised by the Petitioner over the 4th

Respondent is evidenced by the findings set out in the Report R1. These findings

are reproduced in paragraphs 1-6 at pages 10 and 11 of this judgment.

In the instant case, the fixed working hours, leave only upon prior permission,

deduction of salary if leave was taken, were all supervised by the Resident

Engineer who was employed by the Petitioner. There had been considerable

degree of control over the 4th Respondent and furthermore, he has been

prohibited by the terms of the contract itself from working for others in similar

capacity.

The relevant clause 3.2.3 at GC-8 in the General Conditions of Contract reads

as follows:

The consultant shall not engage, and shall cause their Personnel as well as

their Sub-Consultants and their Personnel not to engage, either directly or

indirectly, in any business or professional activities which would conflict with

the activities assigned to them under this Contract.

This Clause clearly revealed the fact that the 4th respondent has been assigned

to do specific activities under the Contract. Those activities appear to be assigned

by the Contractor in furtherance of the contractual obligations between the

Petitioner Company and the Contracting party.

25

In the case CA Writ 194/2016 decided on 05.03.2019 it was held that, based on

the facts and circumstances of the case, that the 5th Respondent who was

working as a Technical Consultant in the Petitioner Company was an employee

and not an independent contractor.

In the said case, the Court has applied the Control Test in reaching its

conclusion. Accordingly, the following excerpts from the judgment are directly

relevant to the matter at hand:

According to P3(b) issued by the petitioner company the 5th respondent, a

female Pilipino national living here under Visa has joined the petitioner company

on 22.01.2007 and left the company on 14.05.2015 after working in the company

as Technical Consultant for 8 years and 3 months. P3(b) particularly says her

basic salary is USD 2,679.00 This is not a consultancy fee paid

depending on work. This goes to show that the 5th Respondent has worked in

the company for a continuous period of 8 years and 3 months for a fixed monthly

salary..

Another condition in the said Agreement is

The consultancy hours of the consultant will be from 7.30 a.m. to 5.45

p.m. from Monday to Friday or as agreed by the two parties.

That means there is a specific time on which she shall report for work and a

specific time for her to off for the day, and was under direct control and supervision

by the petitioner employer.

26

The clause in the Agreement that Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed

to create an employment relationship between the parties to this Agreement is not

decisive. Whether or not employer-employee relationship is formed, shall be

decided not by the label but by circumstances in each individual case

.The email correspondence marked compendiously P6(b) shows that the 5th

respondent is an integral part of the companys team and her work has integrated

into the business of the petitioner company. P6(b) shows how her services had

been appreciated and acknowledged by the employer.

Accordingly, Court held that:

Taking the above matter into account, it is clear that the petitioner company has

had a heavy control over the 5th respondent in the discharge of her duties as a

consultant in the petitioner company. There is no law that people who are

recruited as consultants or discharging duties as consultants shall

necessarily fall within the category of independent contractors. It is my

considered view that the decision of the Commissioner of Labour in P9A that there

was an employer-employee relationship between the petitioner and the 5th

respondent is flawless.

In Perera v Marikar Bawa 1989 1 SLR 347,

The appellant was the Head Cutter of the respondent company. He has provided

with a cubicle but employed his own workmen and used his own tools. The

Company passed on tailoring orders to him and on execution, he was paid a

commission from the collections for each month. The Company collected the

27

payment from the customer and kept the accounts. The appellant did not sign

attendance register and was not entitled to a bonus like other employees. The

question was whether appellant was a workman within the meaning of Industrial

Disputes Act. Was a contract of service or contract for services as an independent

contractor.

Accordingly, it was held that:

The applicants work was an integral part of the respondents business and he

was part and parcel of the organization. The appellant did not carry on his

business of Head Cutter as a business belonging to him. It was a business

done by the appellant for the respondent. Therefore, he was a workman and an

employee within the meaning of the Industrial Disputes Act.

In the said case, even though the appellant was being paid based on commission

and employed his own workman, the Court held that he was an employee of the

respondent company as his work was integral to the work of the company.

In the instant case too, there the 4th respondent did not carry on his

business/service as a technical officer as a business belonging to him. It

was a business done by the 4th Respondent for the Petitioner Company in

furtherance of the Petitioners obligations under consultancy agreements.

28

IS THE 1ST RESPONDENTS ORDER VITIATED BY THE VIOLATION OF

PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL JUSTICE?

It was contended by the Petitioner that R1 reveals that observations, findings,

recommendations contained in it are mainly based on affidavit statements and

the documents produced by the 4th respondent; copies of those documents were

not made available to the Petitioner; R1 mainly consists reproduction of evidence

and submissions without evaluation of evidence and interpretation of

documents; findings are not supported by evidence, contrary to the evidence

produced, unreasonable and irrational; evidence and submissions of the

Petitioner has been ignored; payment mechanism of billing consultancy fees by

issuing invoice has been disregarded.

Furthermore, it was contended that the 1st Respondent has come to the wrong

findings regarding the equipment which were not provided by the Petitioner, but

by the Civil Works Contractors of the project (Tudawe Brothers and Komuthi) as

revealed by Clause 14 in X3. The 1st Respondent has noted the clearance

certificate dated 30.06.2021 which was issued to the 4th Respondent upon

returning items but ignored that the 4th Respondent has signed it under the title

Consultant. It is alleged that this is lack of objectivity.

In CA (Writ) 628/2011 St. Regis Packaging (Pvt.) Limited vs. Commissioner

General of Labour and Others- Judgment dated 18.01.2017-The Court issued

a writ of Certiorari, quashing P2 that imposed EPF liability on the Petitioner in

29

respect of the 4th Respondent on the basis that the inquiry proceedings that

preceded P2 were tainted with procedural impropriety.

In the instant case, a close perusal of R1 reveals that the evidence, the oral and

written submissions forwarded by the Petitioner have been considered by the 1st

Respondent. The payment mechanism of billing Consultancy Fees by the 4th

respondent to the Petitioner has been considered in 3rd, 4th and 5th paragraphs

at page 4 of R1.

It was contended that the 1st respondent has come to the wrong findings with

regard to maintaining a sub office at Angoda, giving equipment to the 4th

respondent; has ignored that the 4th respondent signed clearance certificate

dated 30.06.2021 under the title Consultant which is an omission demonstrate

the lack of objectivity of the 1st Respondent.

In Jafferjee vs. Commissioner of Labour-(2008 1 SLR 12) the CA issued a

writ of Certiorari, quashing the impugned decision in respect of EPF on the basis

that 1st and 2nd Respondents have failed to assign reasons for their decisions. It

is further held that Reasons means not just the evidence recorded and the

documents filed but an evaluation of the evidence and whenever possible, an

interpretation of the documents.

The Court of Appeal further emphasized the distinction between its Appellate

jurisdiction and its power of Judicial Review, observing that it was not for the

Court of Appeal to decide on whether the 3rd Respondent was an employee or

not, it was for the 1st and 2nd Respondents to decide on that issue. However, the

30

Court of Appeal held as the said issue is a mixed question of law and fact, thus

the Court intervene on same if that decision illegal or ultra vires.

However, in the instant case, the 1st Respondent has given detailed report

(R1) with observations and reasons consisting of 8 pages. He has not acted

illegally or his decision is not ultra vires.

The Petitioner has drawn the attention to the case C.A. (Writ) 274/2018

Colombo Municipal Council and Others vs. Commissioner General of

Labour decided 14.10.2020, where it was held that, the relationship between

the CMC and the 4th Respondent, a Rate Collector was not that of employer-

employee, but the 4th Respondent was only an independent contractor of the CMC.

Hence the EPF Act is inapplicable in this instance.

In the said case, Samayawardena J. held, inter alia, as follows:

The 1st Respondent in P26 says the 4th Respondent was part and parcel of the

Colombo Municipal Council, which may be meant to suggest he played a pivotal

role there. I am unable to accept this. The services of the 4th Respondent would

have been helpful to the institution but cannot be said to have been an integral

part thereof. The job of a Rate Collector is limited to collecting rates from defaulters,

that also outside of the premises of the Colombo Municipal Council.

The facts of the said case are clearly distinguishable from the facts of this case

as analyzed in this judgment. In the instant case, applying the integration test,

as I have already examined, there is sufficient evidence to show that the work

31

done by the 4th Respondent were an integral part of the business of the Petitioner

or that they are part and parcel of the Petitioner.

In CA (Writ) 28/2012 Consolidated Marine Engineers vs. Assistant

Commissioner of Labour -decided on 29.05.2020, the Court of Appeal issued a

writ of certiorari quashing the direction to pay EPF in respect of the 4th to 5th

Respondents, who provided services as security guards on the basis that they

have failed to prove that they were employees of the Petitioner within the meaning

of the EPF Act, and hence the conclusion of the Respondent that there is a

contract of service between the Petitioner and 4th to 6th Respondents is not

supported by the evidence led at the inquiry. In holding so, Janak De Silva J.

considered the following:

a. The 4th to 6th Respondents did not sign the attendance book maintained

by the Petitioner in relation to the other employees. They maintained their

own book and got it signed by the Accountant of the Petitioner.

b. Applying the integration test, there is no evidence to show that the work

done by the 4th Respondent were an integral part of the business of the

Petitioner or that they are part and parcel of the Petitioner.

c. Neither is there, evidence that the 4th to 6th Respondents were employees

of the Petitioner as a matter of economic reality.

d. It is true that the 4th to 6th Respondents were issued identity cards by the

Petitioner. But the evidence taken as a whole, negate any relationship of

employer-employee between the parties.

32

The facts of the said case too are clearly distinguishable from the facts of this

case as analyzed above. In the instant case, applying the integration test, I have

already found, there is sufficient evidence to show that the work done by the 4th

Respondent were an integral part of the business of the Petitioner or that they

are part and parcel of the Petitioner.

THE 4TH RESPONDENTS COMPLAINT PERTAINING TO GRATUITY Y1(b)

In terms of Y1(b), the 4th Respondent has named Komuthi HCM Engineers as his

employer. Komuthi was one of the contractors on whose project site the 4th

Respondent carried out his work.

Accordingly, the Petitioner contends that it cannot be the 4th Respondents

employer asserting that he himself has admitted the Komuthi is his employer.

Admittedly, the 4th Respondent has taken a contradictory stance in the

complaint regarding the non-payment of EPF and ETF marked X7(b) naming the

Petitioner as his employer. It was admitted by the 1st to 3rd Respondents that the

4th Respondent has taken a contradictory stance in the complaint marked Y1(b)

concerning gratuity, by referring to Komuthi HCM Engineers as the employer.

Notwithstanding the above, the determination of the relationship is a matter of

law. It is within the statutory remit of the Department of Labour to examine the

relevant facts and arrive at a finding on the existence or absence of such a

relationship. In cases involving complex employment arrangements such as

outsourcing, where even the employee may be unclear as to the identity of the

actual employer. In such circumstances, the subjective view of the employee

33

cannot be determinative of the legal status of the relationship. There is no

evidence adduced as to whether in fact, any gratuity was paid by Komuthi HCM

to the 4th Respondent. Although the 1st Respondent has not considered this

factor, taken along with other evidence, in my view, it does not change the

relationship of Employer-Employee between the Petitioner and the 4th

Respondent.

In the instant case, I find that the 1st Respondent has given ample reasons with

sufficient analysis of evidence in the report marked as R1. It does contain clear

determination on the crucial issue whether the 4th Respondent was an

independent contractor or an employee.

In the circumstances, I see no reason to grant reliefs prayed for by the Petitioner.

Accordingly, this Application is dismissed. No costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal M.T. Mohammed Laffar, J. (Act.P/CA) I agree.
