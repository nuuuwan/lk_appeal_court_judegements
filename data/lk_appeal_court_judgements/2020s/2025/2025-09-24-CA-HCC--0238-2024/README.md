JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted by the Attorney General under

Section 365 B (2) (b) of the Penal Code for committing two counts of Grave

Sexual Abuse on Mohommed Asmir Fathima Alfara between the period of

26.05.2017 and 03.06.2017.

The trial commenced on 07.10.2022. After leading all necessary witnesses,

the prosecution closed the case. The Learned High Court Judge had called

for the defence and the Appellant gave evidence from the witness box, called

a witness on his behalf and closed the case.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the evidence presented by

both parties, convicted the Appellant for the 2nd count and sentenced the

Appellant to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of

Rs.25000/- subject to a default sentence of 06 months simple imprisonment.

In addition, a compensation of Rs.100000/- was ordered with a default

sentence of 06 months simple imprisonment. He was acquitted from the 1st

count.

CA/HCC/0238/2024

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. During the argument

he was connected via Zoom platform from prison.

The following Grounds of Appeal are raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. The Appellant has been denied of a fair trial as when leading evidence

an incompetent witness has been led to give evidence against the

Appellant.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the inter se and

per se contradictions of the evidence adduced by the prosecution

witnesses and thereby has erroneously decided that the prosecution

has proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt.

3. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the evidence

adduced on behalf of the Appellant.

The Facts of this case albeit briefly are as follows.

According to PW1, the victim of this case, she was about 11 years old when

she had undergone this ordeal. The Appellant is her father. She has a

younger brother and all had been living at Sangaraja Mawatha, Colombo-13.

The Appellant had been an iron smith addicted to liquor. As their house had

been a small one, all had been sleeping in one room at night. The victim had

been sleeping in the middle between the Appellant and her mother. The

younger brother slept next to the Appellant.

On the day of the incident, when the victim was sleeping, the Appellant had

inserted his hand inside the top she was wearing and she had pushed the

Appellant’s hand away immediately. Thereafter, the Appellant had grabbed

CA/HCC/0238/2024

4 | P a g e

her hand very hard and had shoved her hand inside his sarong. Although,

she tried to resist the act, she had been unable to do so as the Appellant had

held her hand very tightly and had held her hand against his male organ.

When the Appellant loosened his grip, the victim had pulled her hand back

and felt some sticky substance on her finger. Immediately, she had wiped it

off on the Appellant’s sarong. Although, she had tried to wake her mother up

she had been unable to do so as her mother PW2, used to take some sedative

at night due to an illness.

She could only inform the incident to her mother in the afternoon as the

Appellant was at home until noon. PW2, had first gone to her elder sister and

then had approached her younger sister thereafter and had stayed there

overnight.

As PW2 did not believe the victim’s allegation, the complaint was only lodged

at the Kotahena Police Station two days after the incident.

PW9 W/IP Wickramanayake, who conducted the investigation confirmed

that the complaint was lodged on 09.06.2017. The Appellant was arrested

on that day itself and the victim was produced before the Colombo JMO and

a report has been obtained.

According to the JMO, the victim had clearly described the incident to him.

The JMO entered his opinion in the report and not excluding the sexual

abuse narrated by the victim, has mentioned that such acts as narrated may

not leave any marks.

In the first ground of Appeal, the Appellant contends that the Appellant has

been denied a fair trial as an incompetent witness has been led to give

evidence against the him.

Section 120 (2) of the Evidence Ordinance states:

In Criminal proceedings against any person the husband or wife of such

person respectively shall be a competent witness if called by the accused,

CA/HCC/0238/2024

5 | P a g e

but in that case all communications between them shall cease to be

privileged.

In view of the Section 81 of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance 48

of 1939 (as amended) the wife or husband of a person charged with an

offence specified in the First Schedule shall be a competent witness for the

prosecution.

Therefore, the first ground advanced by the Appellant has no merit.

In the second ground of appeal the Learned Counsel contended that the

Learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the inter se and per se

contradictions of the evidence adduced by the prosecution witnesses and

thereby had erroneously decided that the prosecution has proved the case

beyond a reasonable doubt.

The victim had given evidence without any contradictions or omissions.

When the incident happened, she was only 11 years old. But her evidence

was quite consistent and clearly implicated the Appellant.

PW2 had given evidence and reasonably explained why she was delayed in

going to the police. Although PW2 did not believe the victim, she had gone to

the police three days after the incident and lodged the complaint.

As the evidence given by the victim is clear and quite consistent, the Learned

High Court Judge has accurately considered and accepted them in this case.

Hence, this ground of appeal is devoid any merit.

In the final ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the Learned High

Court Judge has failed to evaluate the evidence adduced on behalf of the

Appellant.

The Learned High Court Judge had accurately stated in his judgment that

the stance taken by the Appellant in his evidence did not tally with his

defence taken during the trial. Further, the Learned High Court Judge had

commented that the Appellant had presented his defence as an afterthought.

CA/HCC/0238/2024

The evidence of the defence witness, the son of the Appellant, is not forceful

enough to create a doubt over the evidence provided by the prosecution

witness.

Due to the aforesaid reasons, the Appellant is not successful under this

ground as well.

In this case the victim had given firm evidence as to the atrocities committed

on her by the Appellant. Even though the incident had happened when the

victim was of a tender age, she had given evidence without any contradictions

or omissions.

In Iswari Prasad v. Mohamed Isa 1963 AIR (SC) 1728 at 1734 his Lordship

has held that;

“In considering the question as to whether evidence given by the witness

should be accepted or not, the court has, no doubt, to examine whether

the witness is, an interested witness and to enquire whether the story

deposed to by him is probable and whether it has been shaken in cross-

examination. That is whether there is a ring of truth surrounding his

testimony.”

Similarly, Justice Thakkar in Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v State of

Gujarat 1983 AIR SC 753 has stated:

“By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video

tape is replayed on the mental screen”.

Therefore, considering the evidence led in this case and guided by the

judgements above, I conclude that this is not an appropriate case in which

CA/HCC/0238/2024

7 | P a g e

to interfere with the judgement delivered by the Learned High Court Judge

on 05.02.2024 against the Appellant. I therefore, dismiss the appeal.

The Registrar is directed to send this judgment to the High Court of Colombo

along with the original case record.
