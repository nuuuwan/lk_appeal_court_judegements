Due to the demise of the said Bramphy Singho the Permit had been issued to the wife Podimanika. In the Permit pertaining to the paddy land Podimanika nominated one of her sons Wijeratne, who is not her eldest son, as the successor. Subsequently, Podimenika had received Grants for both the highland and the paddy land. Upon the demise of Podimanika, the paddy land had been succeeded by the nominee Wijeratne and thereafter by Wijeratne\u2019s daughter, the 7th Respondent. The 7th Respondent had been in possession of the land and had cultivated the land. Thereafter on a complaint made by the eldest son of Podimanika who is the Petitioner\u2019s father, the nomination of Wijeratne\u2019s daughter had been removed and the eldest son of Podimanika, one Karunaratne, the Petitioner's father had succeeded to the Grant. Following the demise of Karunaratne, the Petitioner has succeeded to the Grant and it is alleged that he has been cultivating the said paddy land. As there had been several disputes between the Petitioner and the 7th Respondent, there had been several inquiries and subsequent to the said inquiries, it is alleged that the Grants given to the Petitioner had been cancelled and the title to the paddy land had been given to the 7th Respondent. Aggrieved by the said decision the Petitioner has filed this Application.",

Accordingly, a Permit cannot be issued to a deceased individual. Hence, the authorities had correctly issued it to the other occupier of the land, Bramphy Singho\u2019s wife. She obtained the Permit not in the capacity of the widow of Bramphy Singho but on her own accord. Hence, the Permit was never issued to Bramphy Singho but the Permit holder was Podimanika. Therefore, Podimanika did not accede to the Grant as the widow of Bramphy Singho and received only life interest, but she got title for herself as the Permit holder. Subsequent to her becoming the Permit holder she had decided not to confer it to her eldest son but to another son, namely, Wijeratne. This has been duly done and registered. Thereafter, the Permit holder was given a Grant for the same land marked as P7. This Grant has not been revoked and therefore it is valid. In any event, none of the parties challenged the validity of the Grant, nor the issuance of the Permit to Podimanika or the nominee she made during her lifetime. Thus, the valid title holder to the land depicted in the Grant becomes Podimenika.",
