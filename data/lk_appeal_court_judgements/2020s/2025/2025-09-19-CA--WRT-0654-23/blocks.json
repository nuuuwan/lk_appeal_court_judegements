Both are jurisdictional defects; the first mentioned of these is commonly known in the law as a \u2018patent\u2019 or \u2018total\u2019 want of jurisdiction or a defectus jurisdictionis and the second a \u2018latent\u2019 or \u2018contingent\u2019 want of jurisdiction or a defectus triationis. Both classes of jurisdictional defect result in judgments or orders which are void. But an important difference must also be noted. In that class of case where the want of jurisdiction is patent, no waiver of objection or acquiescence can cure the want of jurisdiction; the reason for this being that to permit parties by their conduct to confer jurisdiction on a tribunal which has none would be to admit a power in the parties to litigation to create new jurisdictions or to extend a jurisdiction beyond its existing limits, both of which are within the exclusive privilege of the legislature; the proceedings in cases within this category are non coram judice and the want of jurisdiction is incurable. In the other class of case, where the want of jurisdiction is contingent only, the judgment or order of the Court will be void only against the party on whom it operates but acquiescence, waiver or inaction on the part of such person may estop him from making or attempting to establish by evidence, any averment to the effect that the Court was lacking in contingent jurisdiction.\u201d [emphasis added.]",

McMahon (1987), local government councillors were in breach of their statutory duty to set the level of local rates. When the district auditor came to determine the issue, the applicants claimed the right to an oral hearing, and that the absence of such a hearing amounted to a breach of the rules of natural justice and was, accordingly, ultra vires. The court disagreed, holding that, since the auditor had given notice of the case against them and had considered written representations from them, he had acted fairly and, accordingly, lawfully.\u201d [emphasis added.]",
