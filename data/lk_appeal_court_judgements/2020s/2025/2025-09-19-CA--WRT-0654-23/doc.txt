JUDGEMENT

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J.

1. The 4th respondent was employed by the 1st petitioner, the National

Council for Disaster Management, on a contractual basis, as the

Assistant Director (Emergency Operations) of the Disaster Management

Centre, on 24.04.2008, and then was made permanent in that capacity

on 01.07.2011.

WRT/0654/23

Page 3 of 22

2. The 4th respondent was nominated, with another, to participate at a

seminar held in Honolulu, Hawaii, from the 9th of February to the 15th

of March, 2017. Upon the 4th respondent proceeding to the USA to

participate in the said seminar, he was provided with accommodation.

Upon arrival, in view of a certain incident, on a complaint of a female

employee, the 4th respondent had been arrested by the Honolulu Police,

and criminal action had been filed in a Court for harassment.

Thereafter, the 4th respondent had been enlarged on bail.

3. The prosecuting attorney of the District Court of the First Circuit of the

Honolulu Division, State of Hawaii, had notified the Disaster

Management Centre of the complaint, according to which the charge is

as follows:

“On or about February 08th, 2017 in the city and county of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, WEERASINGHE NAWARATNE, also known as Mudiyanselage Dammika Nawaratne Weerasinghe Jayathilaka, with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person, did strike, shove, kick, or otherwise touch other person in an offensive manner and/or subject the other person to offensive physical contact, thereby committing the offence of harassment, in violation of Section 711-1106 (1) (a) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.

Dated at Honolulu, Hawaii: February 10th 2017”

4. Upon this incident and the events that followed, the 4th respondent has

returned to Sri Lanka, and upon instructions received from the Ministry

of Disaster Management, the 2nd petitioner Director General, has

caused the interdiction of the 4th respondent. Thereafter, a domestic

inquiry had been conducted in terms of the Establishments Code, and

the 4th respondent’s services had been terminated. The said termination

was preceded by a due finding of the inquiring officer that the allegation

was established. The said inquiring officer has also obtained the details

of the incident in Hawaii through the Sri Lankan Embassy in the USA.

Upon obtaining this information, the same had been brought to the

notice of the 4th respondent who had not responded. The said inquiry

WRT/0654/23

Page 4 of 22

has proceeded on thirteen charges/allegations. During the course of the

arguments, the main contention was whether the matter of termination

could be referred to arbitration under Section 4(1) of the Industrial

Disputes Act, No. 43 of 1950 (hereinafter referred to as the “IDA”), as

amended.

5. After the argument was concluded, both parties tendered their post-

argument written submissions. According to the written submissions

filed on behalf of the 4th respondent the issue for determination in this

appeal has been formulated as follows: “The substantive issue of law

and question for determination is whether a person whose employment

has been terminated is entitled to have the same referred to arbitration.”

In the course of the arguments, the following two related issues arose

for consideration:

i) firstly, if a “live dispute” in the sense of a subsisting

contract of employment was required for a matter to be

referred to arbitration under Section 4(1) of the IDA; and

ii) secondly, if termination is a “minor” industrial dispute

coming within the meaning of Section 4(1).

6. Accordingly, the substantive issue of law is whether there had been a

valid reference of an industrial dispute within the meaning of Section

4(1) of the IDA. This issue had also been raised before the arbitrator as

a preliminary objection, and the arbitrator had overruled the said

objection. In the impugned award these objections have been recorded

as follows:

“01. මෙෙ නඩුව තුළ සජීවී කාර්මික ආරවුලක් (Live Dispute) මනාෙැති බවත්, 02. මෙම් නඩුව අසා තීරණය කිරීෙට කාර්මික අධිකරණයට අධිකරණ බලයක් මනාෙැති බවත්, 03. එනයින් පළමු පාර්ම ශවමේ ඉල්ලීෙ විෙසීෙට ගැනීෙකින් ම ාරව මුල්ල අවස්ථාමේදීෙ නිශ්රභා කරන මලසද, පළමු පාර්මශවමේ ඉල්ලුම්පත්‍රය නිශ්රභා කරන මලසද, නඩු ගාස්තු හා අධිකරණයට ෙැනවැයි හැමෙන මවනත් හා වැඩිෙනත් සහනයන් ලබා මදන මලසත් ය.”

WRT/0654/23

Page 5 of 22

The said objection as raised on 29.08.2022 before the arbitrator (vide

page 94 of the documents) is that “it is the Labour Tribunal that has

jurisdiction in respect of termination of employment, and as such, the

arbitrator has no jurisdiction to take cognisance and entertain this

application.” Accordingly, this issue of jurisdiction has been raised

before the arbitrator.

7. It was the argument of the petitioner that the 3rd respondent arbitrator

does not have jurisdiction in terms of the IDA to hear and determine

the matter, as the employment of the 4th respondent had been

terminated by them, and there is no ‘live dispute’. As opposed to this,

the position of the 4th respondent is that the definition of ‘industrial

dispute’ considered along with the definition of ‘workmen’ will

necessarily include a person whose services have been terminated and

who is not in employment at the time of reference. Accordingly, it was

argued that a matter of termination is an industrial dispute that may

be referred to an arbitrator by a Minister, under Section 4(1) of the IDA.

Section 4 reads as follows:

“(1) The Minister may, if he is of the opinion that an industrial dispute is a minor dispute, refer it, by an order in writing, for settlement by arbitration to an arbitrator appointed by the Minister or to a labour tribunal, notwithstanding that the parties to such dispute or their representatives do not consent to such reference.

(2) The Minister may, by an order in writing, refer any industrial dispute to an industrial court for settlement.”

According to Section 4(1), it is a “minor dispute” in the opinion of the

Minister that may be referred for settlement through arbitration, by an

arbitrator or to a labour tribunal even if parties to the dispute do not

consent to such reference. Whatever that may mean, it is a “minor

dispute” in his opinion that the Minister is empowered to so refer.

8. This matter had been referred to arbitration by the Minister of Labour

acting under Section 4(1). According to Section 4(1), the Minister is

empowered to refer a matter for arbitration notwithstanding the parties

WRT/0654/23

Page 6 of 22

not consenting if, in the opinion of the Minister, that industrial dispute

is a “minor dispute”. The term “minor dispute” was introduced to the

statute by the amending Act No. 62 of 1957. To comprehend the

relevance and the significance and the effect of introducing this new

concept of minor disputes, it is necessary to briefly consider the

legislative development that brought in this concept in 1957. The IDA,

as originally enacted by Act No. 43 of 1950, did not contain or include

labour tribunals as a forum to resolve industrial disputes. The pre-1957

IDA provided for conciliation, arbitration, collective bargaining, and

industrial courts. The scheme of the statute was that these remedies

were accessible and available on the co-operation and consent of the

employer. When such consent and co-operation were not available and

forthcoming, the only available option was a referral by the Minister for

compulsory arbitration. Thus, if the Minister did not so refer, the

workmen were left with no remedy under the IDA. If at all, the option of

a person unjustly terminated from his employment was to resort to the

common law remedies or civil action in the District Court, or maybe for

breach of contract and specific performance of the contract of service.

9. In that backdrop, in 1957, a substantial amendment was brought to the

IDA by Act No. 62 of 1957. This amendment, whilst introducing Part

IVA, incorporated and established labour tribunals, of which the

jurisdiction was specified in Section 31B. An employee was entitled to

make an application to a labour tribunal with or without the consent of

the employer. Correspondingly, the labour tribunal was empowered to

make a just and equitable order awarding reinstatement or

compensation to those who were unfairly dismissed or terminated.

Whilst so introducing the labour tribunal, Section 4 was also amended.

The original Section 4 was repealed, and a new Section 4 was so

introduced. The original Section 4 as it prevailed prior to the amendment

was as follows:

“4. The Minister may, by an order in writing, refer an industrial dispute to an industrial court for settlement if such dispute is in an essential industry or if he is satisfied that such dispute is likely

WRT/0654/23

Page 7 of 22

to prejudice the maintenance or distribution of supplies or services necessary for the life of the community or if he thinks that it is expedient to do so.” [emphasis added.]

The new Section 4, as amended, is as follows:

“4. (1) The Minister may, if he is of the opinion that an industrial dispute is a minor dispute, refer it, by an order in writing, for settlement by arbitration to an arbitrator appointed by the Minister or to a labour tribunal, notwithstanding that the parties to such dispute or their representatives do not consent to such reference.

(2) The Minister may, by an order in writing, refer any industrial dispute to an Industrial Court for settlement.” [emphasis added.]

The legislature, by the above amendment, had introduced and

recognised two categories of industrial disputes: (1) industrial disputes

in its totality, encompassing all disputes, as defined in Section 47 of the

IDA. However, in respect of Section 4(1), a subcategory of the industrial

disputes has been specifically provided for, namely, those disputes

which may be considered as “minor disputes”. This is not defined.

10. Jurisdiction and competence of an arbitrator to take cognisance arise

from the reference under Section 4(1), and the jurisdiction is thus

circumscribed thereby and limited to industrial disputes that are “minor

disputes” in the opinion of the Minister. This limitation is in perfect

harmony with the scheme of the IDA, which confers jurisdiction to the

labour tribunal to determine matters of termination. As it is only a

“minor dispute” that may be referred to arbitration under Section 4(1)

and it is only such a “minor dispute” that an arbitrator can take

cognisance of and adjudicate. The effect, import, and object of the

totality of the Amendment, to my mind, the Minister had been conferred

with a discretion to refer a dispute which in his opinion is “minor” which

is also correspondingly limits the jurisdiction of the arbitrator.

11. In contrast, by Section 4(2), the Minister is also empowered to refer any

industrial dispute to an industrial court for settlement. The legislature,

for good reason, has specified two different categories. It is not an

accident but an intentional inclusion, with a specific object and purpose.

WRT/0654/23

Page 8 of 22

As I see, on a consideration of a totality of these provisions, there is a

clear scheme laid down by the IDA as amended. Firstly, by Section 31B

(1), the labour tribunal is conferred with the jurisdiction to entertain and

take cognisance of matters pertaining to termination of employment.

Section 31B (7) provides that a person is required to invoke such

jurisdiction within six months of the alleged termination. Having been

so established and vested with the said jurisdiction, the statute also

provides for the Minister to make a reference under Section 4(1), subject

to the limitation of minor disputes, by which the legislature has clearly

intended that certain disputes neither be referred to nor adjudicated by

an arbitrator.

12. “Industrial dispute” is defined in Section 47; however, “minor dispute”

is not defined. Primarily it depends on the opinion of the Minister. When

a discretion is to be exercised based on an opinion on a matter of fact, a

Court would be slow to substitute its own opinion on the same. However,

such discretion must be exercised reasonably and not arbitrarily. On the

face of it, if such decision or forming of such opinion shown to be totally

irrational, erroneous, or arbitrary, then a Court acting in review can and

will interfere. Lord Mustill, following Edwards vs. Bairstow [1956] AC

14, is cited in Wade & Forsyth on Administrative Law (9th Edition, at

page 215) as follows:

“On a challenge to the commission’s jurisdiction to undertake the

investigation the House of Lords held that the ‘clear cut approach

[as described in the preceding pages] cannot be applied to every

case, for the criterion so established may itself be so imprecise that

different decision-makers, each acting rationally, might reach

differing conclusions when applying it to the facts of a given case.

In such a case the court is entitled to substitute its own

opinion for that of the person to whom the decision has been

entrusted only if the decision is so aberrant that it cannot

be classed as rational.” [emphasis added.]

WRT/0654/23

Page 9 of 22

This has been reflected in the decision of Karunathilaka and Another

vs. Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections [1999] 1

SLR 157, where Fernando, J., held that,

“Whether such a decision is right or wrong is a question which

involves the merits. Our duty is to decide, not whether that would

be a correct exercise of the Commissioner's discretion, but only

whether that would be an unlawful, arbitrary, capricious, or

unreasonable exercise of discretion. We are of the view that it

would not.”

13. In this instance, the Minister has referred, and the arbitrator has taken

cognisance of a matter of termination of employment. The objection as

to jurisdiction had been so raised that in the absence of a “live dispute”

the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to consider an issue of termination.

This is an objection that goes into the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. When

an issue/objection is raised as to the jurisdiction of a tribunal or

administrative body, it is competent to make a determination. For

instance, the doctrine of “kompetenz-kompetenz”, particularly used in

International Arbitration, states that a legal body, such as a court or

arbitral tribunal, may have competence, or jurisdiction, to rule as to the

extent of its own competence on an issue before it. The doctrine of

kompetenz-kompetenz is enshrined in the UNCITRAL Model Law on

International Commercial Arbitration and Arbitration Rules, where the

Article 16 (1) of the Model Law and Article 23 (1) of the Arbitration Rules

both provide that “[t]he arbitral tribunal shall have the power to rule on

its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence

or validity of the arbitration agreement.”

14. Then in Ittepana vs. Hemawathie (1981) 1 SLR 476, it was held that,

“‘Jurisdiction’ may be defined to be the power of a court to hear and determine a cause, to adjudicate or exercise any judicial power in relation to it. When the jurisdiction of a Court is challenged the Court is competent to determine the question of

WRT/0654/23

Page 10 of 22

jurisdiction. An inquiry whether the Court has jurisdiction in a particular case is not an exercise of jurisdiction over the case itself. It is really an investigation as to whether the conditions of cognizance are satisfied. Therefore, a Court is always clothed with jurisdiction to see whether it has jurisdiction to try the cause submitted to it.”

When the jurisdictional issue was raised before the arbitrator upon the

referral, the arbitrator considered the jurisdictional objection and

rejected the same. Then, it is open for a Court to review and determine

the legality of the jurisdictional issue so raised before the arbitrator.

15. Can termination of employment be reasonably considered as being a

“minor dispute”? When considering the nature and the varying forms of

disputes, termination or the determination of a person’s employment

certainly would be at the top end of the spectrum of such disputes when

considered in an ascending order of seriousness. This is simply so

because termination would be the ultimate and the most serious

decision and dispute that can arise in labour relations between employer

and employee. To my mind, by any stretch of imagination, be it

objectively or subjectively considered, termination cannot be or be

considered a “minor dispute”.

16. The Minister is empowered, in writing, to refer an industrial dispute,

which in his opinion is a “minor dispute”, for arbitration under Section

4(1) of the Act, whether the parties consent to such reference or

otherwise. Such reference presupposes the existence of a dispute of that

nature. Accordingly, if no such industrial dispute existed, or if the said

dispute is not “minor” in nature, the Minister has no power of reference,

and correspondingly, the arbitrator has no power to adjudicate upon

such dispute. This is so for the simple reason that a reference based on

a misconceived or erroneous opinion of the Minister cannot create a non-

existing dispute nor convert a dispute which is otherwise serious to one

of a minor nature. The arbitrator derives jurisdiction by such reference.

WRT/0654/23

Page 11 of 22

17. The arbitrator, upon rejecting the objection, took cognisance and

adjudicated upon a dispute which is certainly not a minor dispute. This

is a clear instance where the arbitrator has acted without jurisdiction.

The arbitrator does not have jurisdiction over the cause or the matter,

namely, that which is not a “minor dispute”. Lord Denning MR in

Pearlman vs. Keepers and Governors of Harrow School [1978]

APP.L.R. 07/14, holding that the decision of a county court could be

quashed for error of law, the normal right of appeal having been cut off

by statute, held that:

“[N]o court or tribunal has any jurisdiction to make an error of law on which the decision of the case depends. If it makes such an error, it goes outside its jurisdiction and certiorari will lie to correct it.”

Confirming the above, Lord Browne-Wilkinson in R vs. Hull University

Visitor ex p. Page [1993] AC 682 held that:

“The fundamental principle is that the courts will intervene to ensure that the powers of public decision making bodies are exercised lawfully. In all cases, save possibly one, this intervention by way of prohibition or certiorari is based on the proposition that such powers have been conferred on the decision maker on the underlying assumption that the powers are to be exercised only within the jurisdiction conferred, in accordance with fair procedures and, in a Wednesbury sense, reasonably. If the decision maker exercises his powers outside the jurisdiction conferred, in a manner which is procedurally irregular or is Wednesbury unreasonable, he is acting ultra vires his powers and therefore unlawfully.”

18. Then, in the case of Beatrice Perera v. The Commissioner General

of Inland Revenue of National Housing (1974) 77 NLR 361 at 366,

Tennekoon C.J. held as follows:

“Lack of competency in a Court is a circumstance that results in a judgment or order that is void. Lack of competency may arise in one of two ways. A Court may lack jurisdiction over the cause or matter or over the parties; it may also lack competence because of failure to comply with such procedural requirements as are necessary for the exercise of power by

WRT/0654/23

Page 12 of 22

the Court. Both are jurisdictional defects; the first mentioned of these is commonly known in the law as a ‘patent’ or ‘total’ want of jurisdiction or a defectus jurisdictionis and the second a ‘latent’ or ‘contingent’ want of jurisdiction or a defectus triationis. Both classes of jurisdictional defect result in judgments or orders which are void. But an important difference must also be noted. In that class of case where the want of jurisdiction is patent, no waiver of objection or acquiescence can cure the want of jurisdiction; the reason for this being that to permit parties by their conduct to confer jurisdiction on a tribunal which has none would be to admit a power in the parties to litigation to create new jurisdictions or to extend a jurisdiction beyond its existing limits, both of which are within the exclusive privilege of the legislature; the proceedings in cases within this category are non coram judice and the want of jurisdiction is incurable. In the other class of case, where the want of jurisdiction is contingent only, the judgment or order of the Court will be void only against the party on whom it operates but acquiescence, waiver or inaction on the part of such person may estop him from making or attempting to establish by evidence, any averment to the effect that the Court was lacking in contingent jurisdiction.” [emphasis added.]

19. The above was followed and cited with approval by a five-bench decision

of the Supreme Court of JMC Jayasekara Management Centre (Pvt)

Limited vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

(SC/Appeal/05/2021, decided on 05.03.2025), where

Samayawardhena, J., held as follows:

“If a decision is ultra vires, it is a nullity for all intents and purposes; it is void, not voidable. In Anthony Naide v. The Ceylon Tea Plantation Co. Ltd. of London (1966) 68 NLR 558 at 560, Sansoni C.J. stated ‘It is clear law that a judgment given without jurisdiction is a nullity, for judicial power is capable of being exercised by a court only when it is a court of competent jurisdiction, and that means competent under some law.’

There is a distinction between an act without jurisdiction and an error within jurisdiction. The non-existence of jurisdiction (patent lack of jurisdiction) and the irregular exercise of jurisdiction (latent lack of jurisdiction) are distinct concepts. The issue at hand constitutes a patent lack of jurisdiction, which is fatal and can be raised at any stage of the proceedings, including for the first time on appeal. No amount of acquiescence, waiver or inaction will cure

WRT/0654/23

Page 13 of 22

such defect, as parties cannot expressly or impliedly confer jurisdiction on a Court where none exists.”

20. Applying the aforesaid tests, I am of the view that the arbitrator has

acted without jurisdiction, that there is a patent lack of jurisdiction, and

that the award so made is a nullity. Objections of this nature can be

taken up at any time, and when so declared, the process and the

decision will be a nullity. To that extent, I hold that the impugned award

is a nullity, and the petitioner is entitled to a writ of certiorari as prayed.

21. Then the issue of a “live dispute” was adverted to and considered by the

arbitrator, as well as both parties, who made extensive submissions on

this matter. The petitioner relied on the decision of Eva Wanasundera,

PC, J., in the case of Mercantile Investments Ltd vs. Mahinda

Madihahewa (SC/Appeal/22/2012, SCM 15.02.2016), with reference

to Section 19(2) of the IDA, and it was opined thus:

“It is obvious that when an award is made, the terms of the award becomes implied terms attached to the contract of employment. So, there should be an existing contract of employment for the award to take effect at the time of making the award at the end of the arbitration. This section presupposes the existence of a valid contract between the employee and the employer.” Therefore, in order to so imply such award as a term of the contract of

employment, the existence and the continuation of the contract of

employment is a necessary prerequisite during and at the point of the

arbitration and the making of the award. It is this requirement that is

referred to as the requirement of a “live dispute”. When the contract of

employment is determined, be it by termination or otherwise, there is no

“live dispute”. It is for this reason that Justice Wanasundera, in the

above judgement, held that:

“The dispute is not “live” anymore because then the employee is not an employee anymore and the relationship between them comes to an end. There is no possibility of “an award to be taken

WRT/0654/23

Page 14 of 22

as implied terms of the contract of employment”, according to Sec. 19 of the Act.

The employee will not be without a remedy. He can make an application to the Labour Tribunal for wrongful termination or constructive termination by the employer if it is the dispute which made him go for employment into another place.”

22. I observe that similar views to that of Justice Wanasundera in

Mercantile Investments Ltd (supra) were followed in the decisions of

Ceylon Bank Employees Union vs. Yatawara (1962) 64 NLR 49, The

State Bank of India vs. Sundaralingam and Others (1971) 73 NLR

514, Upali Newspapers Limited vs. Eksath Kamkaru Samithiya

(1999) 3 SLR 205, and Indrajith Rodrigo vs. Central Engineering

Consultancy Bureau [2009] 1 Sri L.R. 248. Particularly, in The State

Bank of India vs. Sundaralingam and Others (supra), Alles, J., held

that the definition of “industrial dispute” cannot apply to a dispute

between an employer and an ex-employee who has retired, categorising

it as a “cessation of employment and not one of termination or

reinstatement”, concluding as follows:

“When a person ceases to be in employment, there cannot be a live

dispute between the parties which can ever culminate in an award

affecting the terms of employment.”

23. I am also aware and mindful of the contrary views to the judgement of

Justice Wanasundera, expressed in the decisions of S.B. Perera vs.

Standard Chartered Bank and Others (1992) 1 SLR 73, Ranin

Kumar, Proprietor, Messrs Chemie vs. State Pharmaceuticals

Corporation (2004) 1 SLR 277, De Costa vs. ANZ Grindlays Bank

(1996) 1 SLR 307, and the majority opinion of the Supreme Court in

Colombo Apothecaries Co. Ltd. vs. Wijesooriya and Others (1968)

70 NLR 481.

24. Colombo Apothecaries Co. Ltd. v. Wijesooriya and Others (1968) 70

NLR 481 was a judgement of a Divisional Bench of seven judges of the

WRT/0654/23

Page 15 of 22

Supreme Court, with a majority and a minority opinion, on whether a

dispute arising from the termination of a workman's services

(specifically, between an employer and the dismissed workman)

constituted an “industrial dispute” for the Minister to refer. The majority

opinion of the Court (by their Lordships T.S. Fernando, G.P.A. Silva, Siva

Supramaniam, Samerawickrame, JJ.) was that the dispute was an

“industrial dispute” within the meaning of Section 48, and the Minister

had the power to refer it for settlement, holding that a “dispute or

difference” connected with the termination of services “arises at least

contemporaneously with the dismissal”. The fact that the employer-

workman relationship ceased after the dispute arose (or at the moment

of dismissal) did not extinguish the dispute or affect the Minister's power

to refer it.

25. However, the minority opinion (by their Lordships H.N.G. Fernando,

C.J., Abeyesundere, J., and Tennekoon, J.) aligns with Justice

Wanasundera's view in Mercantile Investments Ltd. The minority,

particularly Tennekoon, J. (as his Lordship then was), argued that the

dispute was not an “industrial dispute” as defined, and therefore the

Minister's reference was ultra vires and invalid. The reasoning

(predominantly of Tennekoon, J.) was based on the fact that the

definitions of “employer” and “workman” primarily refer to a subsisting

contract of service. The third limb of the “workman” definition (“for the

purposes of any proceedings... includes any person whose services have

been terminated”) applies only during proceedings, not before the

reference to determine if a dispute is an industrial dispute. It

presupposes the existence of an industrial dispute and cannot be

used to establish its initial existence. Tennekoon, J., concluded that

at the time the dispute arose, “neither the company nor the 2nd

respondent qualified as ‘employer’ or ‘workman’ respectively within the

meaning of those words in the phrase 'dispute or difference between an

employer and a workman’.”

WRT/0654/23

Page 16 of 22

26. As I have already held that termination is not and cannot be considered

a “minor dispute” and the arbitrator does not have jurisdiction, it is no

longer necessary to consider the issue of “live dispute”; however, I must

confess that in the context of the totality of the amendments brought in

by Act No. 62 of 1957, the opinion of Justice Wanasundera in

Mercantile Investments Ltd (supra), to my mind is in consonance with

the symmetry and the scheme of the IDA.

27. Notwithstanding the above finding that the award is a nullity, I will, for

the purpose of completeness, consider the merits of the findings of fact

of the award. The arbitrator has come to the finding that the disciplinary

sanction imposed on the respondent is not just and equitable and held

that injustice has been caused to the 4th respondent and awarded

reinstatement and payment of back wages for the period under

interdiction. The said amount so calculated is to be Rs. 3,732,768.00/-

and accordingly, the said award has been made. I observe that the

arbitrator has not afforded the opportunity to the petitioner to lead

evidence and has, in the most ad hoc and arbitrary manner, on his own

volition, in the course of the evidence of the 1st witness, directed the

filing of affidavits and suddenly ordered that this will be determined on

written submissions. The petitioner alleges that the arbitrator was due

to migrate, and this was the reason for the said unusual conduct.

28. On a perusal of the proceedings before the arbitrator, it is apparent,

and I clearly observe, that the conduct of the hearing is rather unusual

and irregular. At various points, the arbitrator seems to make orders as

to the filing of affidavits and concluding the matter on written

submissions. On some occasions, these orders are made in the absence

of the parties. The sum total is that the arbitrator has not allowed the

petitioner (the 2nd party before the arbitrator) to lead and conclude the

evidence, even of the 1st witness who had been called. The arbitrator has

thus failed to make all such inquiries that were necessary and hear such

evidence that the parties intended to tender. Whilst there is an apparent

WRT/0654/23

Page 17 of 22

denial of a fair hearing, this is also, to a great degree, violative of Section

17(1) of the IDA, which requires the arbitrator to make all inquiries as

he may consider necessary and hear such evidence as may be tendered

by parties, and thereafter to make such award. The hearing, in the

context of the rule of fair procedure, does not have to be a hearing of oral

testimony. Providing an opportunity to file written submissions or place

material by way of affidavit may be sufficient. In Hilaire Barnett’s

Constitutional & Administrative Law (9th Ed., at page 615) it is opined

as follows:

“Where there exists no right to an oral hearing, the question becomes one of the extent to which – and means by which – the view of the individual can be put to the decision making authority. It may well be the case that the opportunity to make written submissions will satisfy the requirements for justice and fairness. For example, in Lloyd v. McMahon (1987), local government councillors were in breach of their statutory duty to set the level of local rates. When the district auditor came to determine the issue, the applicants claimed the right to an oral hearing, and that the absence of such a hearing amounted to a breach of the rules of natural justice and was, accordingly, ultra vires. The court disagreed, holding that, since the auditor had given notice of the case against them and had considered written representations from them, he had acted fairly and, accordingly, lawfully.” [emphasis added.]

29. In the present matter, the 1st petitioner (the 2nd party before the

arbitrator) had been able to lead a major part of the evidence in chief of

the 1st witness, an administration officer, and submit marked

documents R-1 to R-11, which include the internal inquiry report, the

charge sheet and other documents which contain a summary of the

submission led. To some extent, the necessary evidence and material

appeared to have been elicited or brought into the record. However, the

arbitrator in making his award has failed to advert to and consider this

material. The arbitrator has also completely failed to appreciate and

consider the basis on which the alleged termination is said to have been

made. Thus, it appears that the conduct of the hearing has been

WRT/0654/23

Page 18 of 22

irregular, inconsistent and piecemeal. Notwithstanding the filing of

written submissions being permitted, the overall effect of this haphazard

procedure followed is that a fair hearing has not been afforded to the 1st

petitioner (the 2nd party before the arbitrator). This is also an additional

ground which vitiates the impugned arbitral award.

30. Upon considering the evidence and documents R-1 to R-11 and the

written submission, the arbitrator has determined that there is a failure

to prove the alleged incident of harassment, as alleged to have been

committed in Honolulu. The arbitrator refers to the presumption of

innocence and observes that the internal inquirer has failed to

appreciate the alleged criminal offence and finds that the matter has not

been duly proved at the domestic inquiry. On this observation, the

arbitrator has come to the finding as stated above. The arbitrator has

concluded that there is no evidence to prove the 4th respondent

committed the alleged criminal act of harassment. The basis of

termination is not committing the said criminal act, but the 4th

respondent putting himself into a situation in which such an allegation

was made and the criminal process was set in motion. This aspect is not

in dispute and is common ground. The said basis of termination is

reflected by the allegations preferred at the domestic inquiry.

31. The charge sheet consists of thirteen allegations, of which the alleged

criminal act of harassment was the second allegation. The allegations do

not allege the committing of the criminal act of harassment as charged

in the Honolulu courts. The said allegations are as follows:

a. Count 1 pertains to proceeding to attend the training program

without disclosing his state of ill-health;

b. Count 2 is the denial of that opportunity to another officer;

c. Count 3 is on getting involved in a verbal altercation with an

employee in Honolulu;

d. Count 4 is the harassment or assault or attempting to so assault

a female employee;

WRT/0654/23

Page 19 of 22

e. Count 5 is getting into a situation and circumstance which

afforded the opportunity to the Honolulu Police to arrest and

produce the respondent before a court of law;

f. Count 6 is creating the conditions that enabled the organisers to

remove him from the said programme;

g. Count 7 is a general count of bringing Sri Lanka into disrepute

by the commission of acts alleged in counts 3, 4, 5 and 6;

h. Count 8 is causing the wastage of funds allocated and spent for

the respondent officer to travel to the United States;

i. Count 9 is causing financial loss by his conduct;

j. Count 10 is the denial of the opportunity for another officer to

participate in the said programme;

k. Count 11 is the failure to inform the Sri Lankan authorities of the

incident until it was brought to the notice by the Sri Lankan

Embassy of the USA; and

l. Counts 12 and 13 are general charges based on counts 1-9 and

counts 1-12 of general breach of trust and causing disrepute.

32. At the domestic inquiry, the 4th respondent was preferred with 13

counts, and the arbitrator has only considered one issue: the failure to

prove the committing of the alleged criminal act of harassment in respect

of which the 4th respondent has been charged in Honolulu. There is no

disciplinary charge of committing such an act of harassment preferred

against the respondent at the disciplinary hearing. Various matters

resulting from and arising due to the 4th respondent allegedly getting

involved in a criminal incident and being arrested is what is alleged in

all these disciplinary charges. The arbitrator has erroneously proceeded

on the premise that the entire disciplinary proceedings, the finding, and

the termination are dependent upon the proof beyond reasonable doubt

of a criminal allegation. The arbitrator has failed to consider and

comprehend that the termination was not based on the proof of the

criminal charge of harassment but, inter alia, on getting himself into

certain situations due to being involved in some criminal allegation.

WRT/0654/23

Page 20 of 22

33. The arbitrator was required to consider if the termination was just and

fair. The basis of termination is the proof of the 13 allegations

cumulatively and not the proof of the committing of a crime in Honolulu.

The 4th respondent has admitted being involved in some incident

involving a female employee, being arrested, being charged in a criminal

court, being released on bail, that he was not permitted to participate in

the intended training programme and that he returned without such

participation. The disciplinary allegations are premised on the 4th

respondent placing himself in a situation and circumstances that

resulted in him being criminally charged and being denied participation

in the programme. These basic facts are thus common ground and

admitted, except that the 4th respondent denies assaulting or harassing

a lady but admits some unpleasant exchange of words. This incident

had led to the immediate attention of the hotel management, with the

condominium staff and the organisers being alerted, as well as the

Police. Rightly or wrongly, a complaint has been made to the Police and

the criminal process has also been set in motion. As to whether he

committed an act of harassment or not in the criminal sense, it is not

the issue that is relevant to the disciplinary allegations preferred against

the 4th respondent, but the fact of getting himself into such a situation

in the first place. The arbitrator has completely failed to ascertain the

core nature of the allegations levelled against the 4th respondent and the

basis of termination. On a perusal of the evidence, I observe that the 4th

respondent’s evidence, by itself, establishes the basic factual matters on

which the termination was based.

34. As to such acts of misconduct causing and bringing Sri Lanka into

disrepute, as alleged by the said charges, will be matters of inference.

When an officer visits a foreign country on training programmes as an

officer from an institution of Sri Lanka, a very high standard of conduct

is required to be maintained. What is relevant is that admittedly, there

have been several other participants from Sri Lanka who all have been

provided with the same facilities and placed in similar circumstances as

WRT/0654/23

Page 21 of 22

that of the 4th respondent. There is no allegation or incident against any

other but the 4th respondent. This leads to the necessary inference that

the 4th respondent has failed to conduct himself with the necessary

decorum and restraint and has placed himself in the position that

provided the opportunity and the circumstances which compelled the

Honolulu authorities to institute criminal action. All other alleged acts

and events, and his termination, flow from this basic incident.

35. The arbitrator has thus not considered the evidence in its totality and

the alleged conduct which warranted the disciplinary action. In this

context, I find that the award of the arbitrator is vitiated by his reliance

on irrelevant considerations and failure to properly evaluate the relevant

material before him. As noted in Wade & Forsyth’s Administrative Law

(11th Ed., at p. 323):

“[T]here are many cases in which a public authority has been held to have acted from improper motives or upon irrelevant considerations, or to have failed to take account of relevant considerations, so that its action is ultra vires and void. It is impossible to separate these cleanly from other cases of unreasonableness and abuse of power, since the court may use a variety of interchangeable explanations, as was pointed out by Lord Greene. Regarded collectively, these cases show the great importance of strictly correct motives and purposes. They show also how fallacious it is to suppose that powers conferred in unrestricted language confer unrestricted power.”

This principle was also applied by A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J., in Tennakoon

Mudiyanselage Janaka Bandara Tennakoon vs. Hon. Attorney

General and Others CA/WRT/335/2016 (15.11.2020), where His

Lordship held that:

“In administrative justice, failure to take into account relevant considerations and taking into account irrelevant considerations would taint and nullify the decision as illegality which is an aspect of Wednesbury unreasonableness. Our attention has not been drawn to any analysis or consideration of these matters before a decision was made to indict the Petitioner.”

WRT/0654/23

36. In the above circumstances, it is clear that the arbitrator has completely

failed to appreciate and evaluate the totality of the evidence and failed

to consider the basis of the termination. In these circumstances the

finding of the arbitrator is, to my mind, irrational, unreasonable, and

arbitrary.

37. Accordingly, the writ of certiorari as prayed for by prayer (c) is issued,

and the arbitral award No. A/01/2022, dated 11.05.2023, published in

the Gazette (Extraordinary) No. 2335/10, dated 06.06.2023 (marked P-

60), is hereby quashed.

38. Consequent to the aforesaid, the petitioner is entitled to obtain and

receive the sum of Rs. 3,732,768.00 and the accrued interest as referred

to in prayer (e), and the 2nd respondent is directed to take necessary

steps to release the said deposit and the accrued interest accordingly.

Application is allowed.
