The Supreme Court, in its final determination, upheld the orders of the Primary Court and the Court of Appeals recognizing the Respondents right of way over Lot 30, and expressly directed the Appellant not to obstruct the Respondents use of Lot 30 as a roadway leading to her land.

In Ratnayake v. Padmini de Silva and another23, the Court of Appeal reaffirmed that non-compliance with every rule of procedure does not destroy jurisdiction; revisionary powers will only be exercised where the defect constitutes an illegality that has occasioned a failure of justice or prejudiced substantial rights. Most recently, in Ananda Sarath Paranagama v. Dhammadhinna Sarath Paranagama and others,24 the Court emphasised that a revision application is confined to correcting illegalities and patent irregularities of such magnitude as to warrant intervention, and that the remedy cannot be used as a substitute for appeal or as a routine second look at a concluded judgment.
