JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted by the Attorney General for

committing two counts of statutory rape on Hewa Pedige Thilini Kumari - an

offence punishable under Section 364(2) of the Penal Code, between the

period of 01.11.2017 and 30.11.2017.

On 21.07.2023, PW1, the victim had requested to file an affidavit in order to

conclude the case in a brief and /or expeditious manner. On 15.09.2023, the

Appellant had sought an adjournment to conclude the case in a brief and/or

expeditious manner. On 16.10.2023, PW1 had agreed to receive a

compensation of Rs.100,000/- and the Appellant requested three months

time to settle the said compensation.

On 16.01.2024, the evidence of PW1 was led with regard to the affidavit in

which she had declared that she had been in a love affair with the Appellant

(page 60 of the brief). However, according to the brief, on the said date upon

the application of the State Counsel, the Court has proceeded with the pre-

trial conference and has proceeded to take the matter for trial.

CA/HCC/209/2024

On 25.03.2024, the indictment was read to the Appellant and thereafter, he

had pleaded not guilty to the charges. Thereafter, evidence of PW1 and PW2

had been led and concluded. As the Appellant expressed his willingness to

plead guilty to the indictment, on 16.07.2024, the indictment was read again

and the Appellant had pleaded guilty to both charges.

After the sentencing submissions of both parties, the learned High Court

Judge had imposed 10 years rigorous imprisonment with Rs.10,000/- fine

with a default sentence of 3 months simple imprisonment for each of the

charges of rape. It was further ordered that the sentences should run

concurrent to each other.

Additionally, a compensation of Rs.300,000/- was ordered with a default

sentence of 6 months simple imprisonment.

The learned High Court Judge duly considered the fact that the Appellant

and the victim were lovers, and which resulted in the birth of a child.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. The Appellant was

produced via zoom platform by the Prison Authorities.

At the very outset of the trial the learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted

to Court that both the Appellant and the victim are now married to different

persons and leading separate family lives with children as well.

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the facts/factual

circumstances of the case.

CA/HCC/209/2024

4 | P a g e

2. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the law and/or

authorities to offences punishable under Section 364(2)(e) of the Penal

Code.

3. Would a non-custodial sentence have met the ends of justice, given

the circumstances of the case?

The learned Counsel for the Appellant, considering all the circumstances in

relation to this matter at the very outset, urges the indulgence of this court

to consider applying the principles laid down in the Supreme Court

determination No. 03 of 2008 decided on 15.08.2008.

The exclusive reason for the above preliminary submission is the fact that

the Appellant and the victim had been in a romantic relationship, which

subsequently resulted in the birth of a child.

The Learned Deputy Solicitor General having considered the submissions

made by the counsel for the Appellant, informed the court that given the

facts and the circumstances that led to the conviction and other incidental

matters, if the court decides to apply the relevant principle due to the

uniqueness of this case and only in relation to the facts of this case, he would

not be standing in the way as sentencing is a matter that which entirely vests

with the court.

The Facts of this case albeit briefly are as follows.

The victim was 14 years old when she was in a romantic relationship with

the Appellant. In her cross examination she had admitted that it was the first

time that she has had an affair. In this case no evidence surfaced that of any

threat or force had been perpetrated on the victim by the Appellant. Although

consent is immaterial when the girl is below 16 years of age, in this case their

intimate relationship had occurred by way of mutual consent.

CA/HCC/209/2024

The Appellant withdrew his earlier plea of not guilty, using his entitlement

under Section 183 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979, and

pleaded guilty to the charges famed against him.

Now the Appellant seeks the courts indulgence only to reconsider his jail

sentence on the application of the Supreme Court determination given in No.

03/2008 decided on 15/08/2008.

In the aforementioned SC Reference, the High Court of Anuradhapura by its

communication dated 14/05/2008, made a reference to the Supreme Court

in terms of Article 125(1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka. In that reference,

the Learned High Court Judge of Anuradhapura had queried whether

Section 364(2) of the Penal Code as amended by the Penal code (Amendment)

Act No.22 of 1995, had removed the judicial discretion when sentencing an

accused convicted of an offence in terms of that section.

In the said reference Justice P. A. Ratnayake held that:

the minimum mandatory sentence in Section 364(2)(e) is in conflict with

Article 4(c), 11, and 12(1) of the Constitution.

Article 80(3) (of the Constitution) only applies where the validity of an Act

is called into question. However, Article 80(3) does not prevent a court from

exercising its most traditional function of interpreting laws. Interpretation

of laws will often require a court to determine the applicable law in the

event of a conflict between two laws. This is a function that has been

exercised by this court from time immemorial.

In the event of a conflict between an ordinary law and the Constitution, the

constitutional provisions must prevail over an ordinary law.

The minimum mandatory sentence in Section 364(2)(e) of the Penal Code

is in conflict with Article 4(e),11 and 12 of the Constitution and the High

Court is not inhibited from imposing a sentence that it deems appropriate

CA/HCC/209/2024

6 | P a g e

in the exercise of its judicial discretion notwithstanding the minimum

mandatory sentence.

In this case the Appellant was charged for two counts of statutory rape under

Section 364(2) of the Penal Code and the Section states:

Commits rape on a woman under eighteen years shall be punished

with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than ten years and not

exceeding twenty years and with fine and shall in addition be ordered

to pay compensation of an amount determined by court to the person

in respect of whom the offence was committed for the injuries caused

to such person.

In this case the Appellant was sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment

on each count with a fine and compensation as stated above.

According to the Counsel for the Appellant in SC Reference No.03/2008 the

victim was only 15 years at the time of the incident and she had given a letter

to her mother that she intended to elope with the Accused, which was

produced to the court where it was established that there had been a

romantic relationship between them, which is similar to the present case

now before this court.

Further it was submitted that in SC Reference No.03/2008 at the time of

the judgment, the Accused and the complainant were married (not to each

other but to different persons) and were each leading a successful family life.

Taking this fact into mind, the court recognised that imposing a long

custodial sentence would effectively mean that the family life of the Accused

would be disrupted.

This fact is similar to the facts of the present case since both the Appellant

and PW1 is now married (again, not to each other but to different persons)

and if the sentence imposed on the Appellant is allowed to stand it will

CA/HCC/209/2024

gravely affect the family life of the Appellant and would not benefit the

complainant either.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted to this Court that the

precedent laid down by SC Reference 03/2008 had been followed by a

plethora of judgments rendered by the higher courts of this country.

In SC Appeal 17/2013 decided on 12.03.2015 the Supreme Court held;

The Supreme Court stated that even though the womens consent was

immaterial for the offence of rape when she is under the age of 16 years,

a womens consent is relevant for a Court, in the exercise of its discretion

in deciding the sentence for such an offence.

In this case there is no doubt that the Appellant had committed a very

serious offence punishable under the law. But the Appellant and the victim

had subsequently proceeded to marry different people and have become well

settled in their lives. In the present circumstances both parties need care

and protection as both are married and have children. In order to be good

parents, both need guidance, supervision, reformation and rehabilitation

rather than punishment and branding as a criminal.

Considering the facts of the case and the submissions made by both

counsels, I conclude that this is not an appropriate case to order a custodial

sentence against the Appellant.

Therefore, under the guidance of the judgment given in SC Reference No.3

of 2008, I set aside the sentence of ten years rigorous imprisonment imposed

on the Appellant by the Learned High Court Judge of Avissawella and

substitute a sentence of two years rigorous imprisonment operative from the

date of sentence which is 06.08.2024. The fine imposed by the High Court

will remain unchanged. Considering all the circumstances of the case I

CA/HCC/209/2024

8 | P a g e

substitute Rs.100,000/- as compensation with a default sentence of 6

months simple imprisonment instead of Rs.300,000/- imposed by the High

Court.

Subject to above variation, the appeal is hereby dismissed.

The Registrar is directed to send this judgment to the High Court of

Avissawella along with the original case record.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

R. P. Hettiarachchi, J.

I agree.
