This is an application to obtain a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus, compelling

the 1st Respondent to take necessary steps to pay compensation for the amount of Rs.

75,254,000 to the Petitioner, in accordance with Section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act, for

the acquisition of land bearing assessment No.478/6, Sama Vihara Road, Bloemendhal.

The facts giving rise to this application, as averred by the Petitioner, are summarised as

follow;

The land in question was once owned by the brother of the Petitioner , Eardly Gunasekera,

who passed away issueless.Therefore, the title to the said land devolved to the Petitioner upon

his demise.

According to the Government Gazette dated 13th May 1977, marked as P-5, the Municipal

Commissioner, acting as the acquiring officer under the provisions of the Land Acquisition

Act, acquired the said land. However, compensation had not been paid to the Petitioner.

Accordingly, the said land was divested in favour of the Petitioner by the Government

Gazette No. 779/13 dated 13th August 1993, marked as P-6.

The Petitioner stated that the land had been encroached upon by a Buddhist monk,Venerable

Wimalananda Thero and did a partial construction of a temple named Sama Viharaya on the

property. This occurred while the land was vested by the state during the period from 13th

May 1977 to 13th August 1993. Owing to the resultant dispute, a civil proceeding was

instituted before the District Court of Colombo, by the case bearing No.17090/L, marked as

P-7, which was ultimately determined in favour of the Petitioner .

Subsequently, the land was reacquired under Section 38 of the Land Acquisition Act , by way

of an order published in Gazette No. 1889/33 dated 20th November 2014. The Petitioner then

challenged this acquisition by filing a writ application in the Court of Appeal, bearing No.

CA/Writ No 387/2020 marked as P-16.

3

Whilst the said writ application was pending, a notice in terms of the Section 7 of the Land

Acquisition Act had been published in the Gazette No. 2253/12 dated 09th November 2021,

marked as P-17 along with the petition of the Petitioner.

Following this inquiry held under Section 7 of the Land Acquisition Act, the 1st Respondent

awarded the Petitioner a sum of Rs. 75,254,000 as compensation, in terms of Section 17 of

the Act, according to the document marked as P-20 dated 16th June 2022. Having consented

to the said award of compensation, the Petitioner had withdrawn the writ application marked

as P-16 by a motion dated 24th September 2024 marked as P-21 along with the petition of this

writ application.

Although the compensation for the acquisition of the land has been finalized, the 1st

Respondent has failed to pay it to the Petitioner. Therefore, he sent three letters, marked as P1

to P-3, along with the petition of this writ application, to the 1st Respondent, requesting the

release of the compensation as stipulated under Section 17 of the said Act.

In response to the above letters, 1st Respondent has requested the 2nd Respondent, to whom

the above land has been divested, to pay the compensation finalized under Section 17 of the

said Act. However, the Petitioner has not been paid the compensation.

Being aggrieved by the said process and the undue delay in the payment of compensation, the

Petitioner has filed instant writ application to compel the 1st Respondent to pay the

compensation to which he is entitled for the acquisition of his land.

When this matter was taken up for argument on 2nd of July 2025, the Learned Deputy

Solicitor General, who had previously represented both Respondents, informed Court that she

is only appearing for the 1st Respondent and that the file had been returned to the 2nd

Respondent. She further informed that she is ready to abide by the decision of this Court.

Even though all the Respondents were duly notified, none of them filed their respective

objections in relation to this writ application.

Upon consideration of the submissions made and documents filed, the following facts remain

undisputed:

1. The land was first acquired under the Land Acquisition Act in 1977.

2. The land was divested in favour of the Petitioner in 1993.

3. The land was reacquired under the same Act in 2021.

4. A compensation of a sum of Rs. 75,254,000 was awarded with the consent of the

Petitioner.

5. The land was subsequently divested to the 2nd Respondent.

The only issue to be decided in this application is the payment of compensation.

As per the document marked as P-20, the acquiring officer, after an inquiry under section 17

of the said act, arrived at a conclusion to award a sum of Rs. 75,254,000 to the Petitioner who

has also consented to the said award. Therefore, it is the duty of the 1st Respondent as the

acquiring officer under the Land Acquisition Act, to pay the compensation to the person

entitled to it.

Considering the document marked as P-23, this court is of the view that divesting the

acquired land to the 2nd Respondent is an internal arrangement between two state entities, and

a dispute between these governmental institutions should not result in the victimization of a

citizen of the country.

On the other hand, this land was initially acquired in 1977 and subsequently divested to the

Petitioner in 1993.During this period, land was encroached upon, and he had to resort to

litigation to protect his title and regain possession. Once again, this land was acquired in

2021, but he has not yet received the compensation to which he is entitled.

Considering the age of the Petitioner and other relevant factors, the 1st Respondent should

have paid the compensation expeditiously. However, this has not been done. Therefore, the

Petitioner has been forced to seek reliefs from this Court. This inefficient and irresponsible

attitude of the authorities, especially the acquiring officer, has caused unnecessary hardship to

the Petitioner.

5

In view of the above, it is abundantly clear that the 1st Respondent failed to fulfill his public

duty.

Considering the aforementioned circumstances of this case and the reasons given above, I am

inclined to issue a writ of Mandamus as sought in paragraph (b) of the prayer of the petition

dated 30th January 2025.

I make no order for costs.
