JUDGMENT

1. The appellant was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of Colombo on

two counts: (i) kidnapping an underage child from her lawful guardian, and (ii)

committing grave sexual abuse on the said child. These offences are punishable under

sections 354 and 365B(2)(b) of the Penal Code, as amended by Acts No. 22 of 1995, No.

29 of 1998, and No. 16 of 2006.

2. At the trial, 5 witnesses testified on behalf of the prosecution, whereas the appellant

made a dock statement. At the conclusion of the trial, on 17.05.2024 the learned High

Court Judge of convicted the accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant)

for the second charge set out in the indictment and sentenced the appellant for 8 years

rigorous imprisonment. The appellant was also imposed a fine of Rs 15000.00 carrying

a default sentence of 6 months simple imprisonment.

3. Furthermore, the learned trial judge ordered the appellant to pay Rs 150000.00 as

compensation to the victim with a default sentence of one-year simple imprisonment.

Moreover, it was ordered to run the default sentences consecutively. Being aggrieved by

the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant has preferred the instant appeal.

4. While many grounds were initially listed, the counsel for the appellant concentrated on

two main points during the argument. The counsel argued that the trial Judge did not

give enough weight to the contradictions in the evidence presented during the trial. It

was further argued that the victim's statement to the police identified a nearby jungle as

the crime scene, but the investigating officer inspected the appellant's house instead.

Therefore, it is submitted that a potential flaw exists in the police investigation, which

casts doubt on the prosecution's case.

5. Although several grounds of appeal were set out in the petition of appeal, during oral

argument, counsel for the appellant primarily focused on the contradictions highlighted

during the trial, contending that the learned trial judge had failed to give due

consideration to them. It was further argued that, although the victim in his statement to

the police stated that the offence occurred in a nearby jungle, the investigating officer

had inspected only the appellants house, thereby revealing a potential flaw in the police

investigation which, in turn, cast doubt on the prosecutions case.

CA/HCC/0239/2024

6. The case of the prosecution is mainly dependent on the testimony of N.M.Avishka

Madhushan, the victim, who testified as PW1. According to his evidence, the appellant

was known to him and was also a distant relative. On the day of the incident, the victim

was playing with his friends at a nearby playground. Before the victim went to the

playground, the appellant had met him and asked him to come to the appellant's house.

After playing, the victim visited the appellant's house as requested.

7. According to the victim, the alleged offense was committed on him by the appellant on

a makeshift bed at the latter's residence. The appellant asked the victim to remove his

clothes, which he did. Thereafter, the appellant also undressed himself, placed his penis

between the victim's thighs, and moved up and down until he ejaculated. After that, the

appellant gave the victim Rs 200/-, and the victim returned home. At the time of the

alleged offense, the victim was 12 years old.

8. Since the appellant has placed much reliance on the contradictions per se highlighted in

the testimony of the victim, it is apt to consider whether the said contradictions have the

effect of tarnishing the credibility of the evidence of PW1. To elaborate further, the

cardinal issue that needs consideration of this court is whether a particular piece of

evidence which the appellant claims to be contradictions, significant and quite material

which go to the root of the prosecution case. In this regard, following authorities would

be of much assistance.

9. In Rev. Maharagama Suneetha vs. Attorney General (2006) 3 Sri L R 266 it was held

inter alia:

(1) Before proof can be given of a former inconsistent statement and if the statement

is in writing although it need not be shown to the witness or be proved in the

First instance, if it is intended to contradict him by it, his attention must be

drawn to those parts of it to be used for contradicting him and he should also be

afforded with an opportunity to explain such contradictions. This procedure has

not been followed in this case. Therefore, Court cannot take into cognizance the

so-called contradiction or omission at the stage of the appeal.

10. In Aadam Kasam Shaikh vs. The State of Maharashtra, 2006 Cr LJ 4585 (4589), the

Court held that;

(1) "the evidence of a witness cannot be discarded merely because he has made

improvements over his police statements by stating some of the facts for the first

CA/HCC/0239/2024

4 | P a g e

time in his deposition before the court, if the facts stated for the first time before

the court is in the nature of elaboration, do not amount to a contradiction, and

the evidence of witness does not militate against his earlier version".

11. In the case of Mohamed Niyas Naufer and others v. Attorney General (Sc. 01/2006

decided on 08/12/2006), the Court observed that; "when faced with contradictions in a

witness's testimonial, the Court must bear in mind the nature and significance of the

contradictions, viewed in light of the whole of the evidence given by the witness."

12. Justice Shirani Tilakawardane, J. in the case of AG v. Mahadurage Dimson and 3

Others, CA 141/A-B-2000, decided on 24.11.2003, Her Ladyship held that;

(1) The Courts must, while evaluating evidence, bear in mind that in a case of rape

especially a girl of tender age would not come before a Court merely to make a

humiliating statement against her honour. Therefore, contradictions which have

no material effect on the veracity of the prosecutrix case should not be allowed

to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecutrix case.

13. Assessing the credibility of a victim's evidence in a sexual abuse case is a complex and

sensitive process that requires a careful approach. The main goal is to determine the

reliability and truthfulness of the victims testimony while being mindful of their

developmental stage and potential vulnerabilities.

14. A victims testimony doesn't have to be perfect to be credible. It's important to look for

consistency in the core details of their account, even if minor details change. Memory

can be fallible for anyone, especially children, and inconsistencies on peripheral issues

don't automatically mean the entire story is false. Factors like the passage of time, the

number of times the victim has been asked to repeat the story, and his or her age can all

affect the accuracy of recall. Courts should assess such testimony through careful

scrutiny of the narrative, with due regard to child psychology and applicable judicial

safeguards.

15. While minor inconsistencies are to be expected in truthful accounts, significant

contradictions can undermine credibility. Younger children may accurately recall the

core incident but be less precise about details such as timing or sequence. The testimony

of a child victim in a sexual offence case does not require corroboration if it inspires the

CA/HCC/0239/2024

5 | P a g e

confidence of the court; however, the judge must clearly record the reasons for

accepting such testimony in the absence of corroborative evidence.

16. In the present appeal, the victim was 15 years old at the time of the alleged offense.

Evidently, the victim, PW1, was accompanied to the police by PW3 to record the

statement. It is important to note that the officers of the Mulleriyawa police commenced

investigations upon a telephone call received by PW3. There is no evidence that the

victim was influenced by any of his family members or any other person to make a

complaint against the appellant. In fact, when the victim was taken to the police station

to record a statement, no one other than the investigating officers accompanied him.

Hence, it is very unlikely that the victim would have implicated the appellant in his

statement to the police due to any external influence or undue prompting.

17. It is noteworthy that the alleged offence was said to have been committed by the

appellant between April and May 2012. It took seven years to prepare the indictment,

and the trial commenced only in 2022ten years after the alleged offence. In these

circumstances, it would be unrealistic to expect the victim to recount the incident with

mathematical precision. Inevitably, the passage of time may have affected the victims

ability to narrate the events in exact conformity with the statement made to the police

during the investigation. While some inconsistencies or omissions may arise, the crucial

question is whether the victims testimony, when considered in its entirety, is

sufficiently reliable to sustain a safe conviction of the appellant.

18. Before assessing the impact of the contradictions on the prosecutions case, it is

necessary first to determine whether those contradictions were marked in accordance

with the proper procedure.

19. In the case of Gamini Sugathasena & the Others v. The State 1998 (1) SLR 405 whilst

discussing the procedure in marking contradictions, the court held that;

"when a witness is to be contradicted the proper procedure is set out in section 145

of the Evidence Ordinance. This section contemplates that when a witness is to

be contradicted, his attention must be first drawn to the fact of having made a

previous statement and thereafter, more specifically, to the parts of the statement

which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him. It is only after that the

actual writing from which the witness was contradicted, can be proved"

CA/HCC/0239/2024

6 | P a g e

20. From the proceedings of the High Court, it is clear that the defence failed to follow the

proper procedure for marking contradictions. Notably, PW1 expressly denied making

the portions of the statement suggested to him by the defence during cross-examination.

Despite this, the defence did not summon the police officer who recorded the relevant

statements to prove the alleged contradictions. Consequently, the failure to establish the

contradictions meant that there was no necessity for the learned trial judge to consider

them. In any event, for the reasons set out below, none of these contradictions, in my

view, go to the root of the prosecutions case.

21. The first contradiction, marked as V1, concerned an incident that occurred on the road

and does not affect the truthfulness of PW1s evidence. The second contradiction,

marked as V2, related to the location of the offence. In his testimony, PW1 clearly stated

that the offence was committed at the house where the appellant was staying. It was, in

fact, the victim who pointed out this location to PW3. Significantly, the history given by

the victim to the Judicial Medical Officer, as recorded in the Medico-Legal Report (P1),

is consistent with his testimony. The third contradiction, marked as V3, likewise does

not undermine PW1s credibility. The learned High Court Judge has addressed V3 in the

judgment and provided cogent reasons for finding that it was not material and did not

render the victims testimony untrustworthy.

22. It can be observed that the learned High Court Judge has adequately analyzed and

evaluated the evidence of PW1 in the correct perspective. He has considered the

credibility of the PW1s testimony in the back ground of his age and education before he

reached his findings. The learned Judge has ruled out the possibility of the witnesses

having uttered any deliberate falsehood. Hence, it is evident that the contradictions were

not of such materiality as to undermine the credibility of the witness.

23. Thus, the defense argument that the contradictions were not sufficiently considered by

the learned trial Judge is far from satisfactory and must fail. Furthermore, the learned

High Court Judge carefully considered the belatedness of the victim's complaint to the

police and was satisfied with the reasons advanced by the victim for making the

complaint belatedly.

24. In Sumanasena v Attorney General [1999], 3 SLR 137, His Lordship Justice

Jayasuriya held:

(1) "Just because the witness is a belated witness the Court ought not to reject his

testimony on that score alone and that a Court must inquire into the reason for

CA/HCC/0239/2024

7 | P a g e

the delay and if the reason for the delay is plausible and justifiable the Court

could act on the evidence of a belated witness.

25. Justice Sisira De Abrew in the case of Anandappan Vishawanadan v AG, SC Appeal

15/2018, decided on 12.2.2021, held that:

(1) I hold that court should not reject the evidence of a witness who has made a

belated statement to the Police if the delay has been explained. In the present

case the delay in making the statement to the Police has been explained. Thus,

the decision of the learned trial Judge to accept the evidence of witness

Murugase Ravindran cannot be found fault with.

26. Therefore, in light of the above authorities, the belatedness of the victims complaint in

the present case does not, in my opinion, significantly affect the credibility of PW1s

testimony.

27. It is also pertinent to emphasize that it is not the function of an appellate court to re-try a

case already tried. In legal proceedings, the credibility of a witness is indeed primarily a

matter for the trial judge to determine.The judge, having observed the witness's

demeanor and delivery firsthand, is in the best position to assess the truthfulness and

reliability of their testimony. The appellate court will not overturn a finding of fact

unless it's manifestly wrong.

28. In this regard, it is relevant to refer to the dictum in Fraad vs. Brown & Co. Ltd. 20

NLR 282, where it was held that when the issue is mainly on the credibility of witnesses

an appellate court should not interfere unless the findings of the judge are perverse.

29. As held in Dharmasiri vs. Republic of Sri Lanka [2010] 2 SR1L.R 241, credibility of a

witness is mainly a matter for the trial Judge, Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the

findings of a trial Judge with regard to the credibility of a witness unless such findings

of trial Judge are manifestly wrong.

30. In Ariyadasa v Attorney-General, [2012] 1 Sri. L.R. 84, Sisira de Abrew, has held as

follows:

(1) Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb a finding of a trial Judge with regard to

the acceptance or rejection of a testimony of a witness, unless it is manifestly

wrong, when the trial judge has taken such a decision after observing the

demeanour and the deportment of a witness. This is because the trial Judge has

CA/HCC/0239/2024

8 | P a g e

the priceless advantage to observe the demeanour and deportment of the

witness which the Court of Appeal does not have.

31. In the present case, the decision reached by the learned Trial Judge on the totality of the

evidence does not contain any substantial misdirection or non-direction either on the

facts or law.

32. As stated earlier, the credibility of PW1s testimony remains intact despite some trivial

contradictions, which do not weaken the prosecutions case. The learned High Court

Judge carefully analyzed and evaluated the evidence presented by the prosecution

before finding the appellant guilty of the charge of grave sexual abuse.

33. Furthermore, he has adequately taken into account the contradictions highlighted by the

defense and has provided sufficient and cogent reasons as to why those contradictions

alone are not enough to render the victim an untrustworthy witness or to undermine the

credibility of his evidence.

34. More importantly, the learned Judge discussed the relevant legal principles and applied

them correctly in determining the appellants guilt. Therefore, there is no reasonable

basis, upon which, his decision could be interfered with.

35. For the reasons stated above, I dismiss the appeal. Accordingly, I affirm the conviction

of the appellant and the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge. The

sentence shall run from the date of the judgment.
