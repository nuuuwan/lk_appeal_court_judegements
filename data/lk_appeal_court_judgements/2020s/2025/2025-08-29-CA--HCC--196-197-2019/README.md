6. The incident referred to in the charges have occurred on August 25,2009,

at a location adjacent to the kitchen of the deceaseds home. At approximately 09.30 pm, the deceased has been in the midst of his dinner when the first appellant had jumped over the parapet wall surrounding the deceaseds property and challenged him to step outside and confront him. 7. The first appellant has thereafter, approached the deceased and insisted

on moving to a location near the kitchen of the deceaseds house to talk. When the first appellant attempted to place his hand on the deceaseds shoulder to guide him, the deceased has resisted, jerking the appellants arm away. In response, the first appellant has assaulted the deceased with a clenched fist. 8. Following this initial altercation, the third accused named in the

indictment has jumped over the parapet wall, soon followed by the second appellant. The fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and the eighth accused have also allegedly gathered at the scene. 9. During the attack, the second appellant has returned towards his house

and re-emerged shortly after, armed with a knife. He has then stabbed the deceased while the first appellant encouraged him to commit the act. 10. After the incident, PW01 has sought help from the neighbours and

subsequently made a complaint to the Police, prompting the commencement of an investigation. On August 26,2009, PW04, Dr. N. A. S. U. Wijerathne has conducted a post-mortem examination on the deceased. The doctor has observed 19 external injuries on the body; 13 of these have been cut injuries, while the remaining 6 have been contusions. Dr. Wijerathne has opined that the cut injuries where the cause of death. The post-mortem report has been marked as -4.

Case of the appellants

11. The first appellant has chosen to remain silent and has not called any

witnesses to support his case. 12. The second appellant has chosen not to call any witnesses in his defence.

However, he has made a statement from the dock asserting that he was not involved in the incident referred to in the charges in the indictment. 13. The second appellant has also stated that the deceased had offered him

a block of land, which he accepted and developed. After the development, the deceased, proposed to buy back the land from the second appellant. when the appellant failed to vacate the property, the deceased allegedly threatened him through third parties. 14. When the appeal was taken up for argument, the following grounds of

appeal were urged by the respective learned counsel;

On behalf of the 1st appellant;

i. Does the evidence lead at the trial warrant the

consideration of the exception of sudden fight within the ambit of expection 4 to section 294 of the Penal Code?

On behalf of the 2nd appellant;

i. The judgment of the learned Trial Judge is legally and

factually flawed and untenable, and is also in total violation of section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 for the reason enumerated below;

a. Non-compliance with section 283(2) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act.

15. Section 294 of the Penal Code provide for conditions where a homicide

can be mitigated from murder to culpable homicide. It lays out several exceptions that may not exonerate the offender but can lessen the offence.

16. Exception 4 to section 294 of the Penal Code provides that,

Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon sudden

Page 6 of 10

quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. Explanation It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault. 17. When involving the sudden fight exception, certain elements needs to be

established;

i. Sudden fight: the incident must be unexpected and arise suddenly, without any prior planning, ii. Absence of pre-meditation:

the offender must not have deliberated or planned the homicide beforehand, the action should occur in the heat of the moment, iii. No undue advantage:

the offender should not exploit the situation or have an unfair advantage over the victim, ensuring a degree of evenness in the confrontation or, iv. The offender should not act in a cruel or unusual manner. 18. Initially, the first appellant has jumped over the parapet wall

surrounding the property of the deceased and called out the deceased in a crude manner demanding that he come out of his house. He has then approached the deceased, insisting that they move further away for a discussion. When the deceased resisted, the first appellant has attempted to drag him away. In response, the deceased has jerked the first appellants arm. Consequently, the first appellant has struck the deceased in the abdomen. 19. At this point, the third accused named in the indictment, along with the

second appellant have also jumped over the parapet wall and joined the appellant in assaulting the deceased. After a short while, the second appellant has returned to his house and come back with a knife. He has warned PW01 that he intended to finish the deceased and thereafter proceeded to inflict injuries on him with the knife. Throughout this

Page 7 of 10

attack, the first appellant has encouraged the second appellant to continue his assault. 20. The events referred to above, suggests that the exchange of blows was

pre-arranged and pre-planned. The fight has not been an unexpected occurrence; there has been a significant lapse of time between the gathering of the individuals involved and the onset of violence which caused the fatal injuries. It appears that a sufficient time has passed for any initial passion to subside, indicating that the actions leading to the fatal injuries inflicted on the deceased can be considered premeditated. 21. Further, in light of the evidence provided, it seems clear that the actions

of the appellants were not only unjust but also ruthless. The fact that the deceased was unarmed, underscores the imbalance in the confrontation suggesting the appellants premeditated actions and exploited the deceaseds vulnerable state. 22. In Amaranath Singh AIR 1928 OUD 282, the Supreme Court of India has

observed as follows;

If two men were fighting and one of them unarmed while the other uses a deadly weapon. The one who use such a weapon must be held to have taken an undue advantage and not entitled to the benefit of this exception. 23. The learned counsel for the second appellant has complained that the

impugned judgment is not according to law, hence it should be set aside. 24. Provisions concerning judgments of courts other that the Supreme Court

and the Court of Appeal are outlined in section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

Section 283 is as follows;

The following provisions shall apply for the judgments of courts other than the Supreme Court or Court of Appeal:

(1) The Judgment shall be written by the Judge who heard the case and shall be dated and signed by him in open Court at the time of pronouncing it, and in a case

Page 8 of 10

where appeal lies shall contain the point or points for determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for the decision.

(2) It shall specify the offence if any of which and the section of the law under which the accused is convicted and the punishment to which he is sentenced.

(3) If it be a judgment of acquittal, it shall state the offence which the accused is acquitted.

(4) When a judgment has been so signed it cannot be altered or reviewed by the court which gives such judgment:

Provided that a clerical error may be rectified at any time before the court rises for the day.

(5) The Judgment shall be explained to the accused affected thereby and a copy thereof shall be given to him without delay if he applies for it.

(6) The original shall be filed with the record of

proceedings. 25. In Chandrasena and Others vs. Munaweera [1998] 3 SLR page 94, at 96,

Jayasuriya J has stated as follows;

In Ibrahim vs. Inspector of Police 59 NLR 235, the Supreme Court emphasized that the mere outline of the prosecution and the defence without reasons being given for the decision but embellished by such phrases as I accept the evidence of the prosecution and I disbelieve the defence is by itself an insufficient discharge of duty cast upon the Judge by section 306(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. vide also the decision in Thusaiya vs Pathihamy 15 CLW 119 by Nihill, J. According to the presently applicable section 283(1) of the Code of the Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979, the Judgment shall contain the point or points for determination, the decision thereon and the reasons for the decision. The Supreme Court stressed that the object of the statutory provision is to enable the Supreme Court to have before it the specific opinion of the Judge in the lower Court on the question of fact, so that it may enable the Court to ascertain whether the finding is correct or not. The weight of authority is to the effect that the failure to observe the imperative

Page 9 of 10

provisions of the section is a fatal irregularity and that even in a simple case that the provisions of this statute must be complied with.

26. In James Silva vs. the Republic of Sri Lanka [1980] 2 SLR Pg 167, Rodrigo

J has stated as follows;

A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilty or innocence is to consider all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by the defence in its totality without compartmentalizing and, ask himself whether as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he believes the accused guilty or not guilty. See the Privy Council Judgment in Jayasena vs The Queen 72 NLR 313.

27. In analysing the learned High Court Judges approach to the judgment

in dispute, the following is clear. 28. The learned High Court Judge has begun his judgment with a clear

outline of the charges against the appellants and the other accused parties, establishing the context for the evaluation. Following this, a list of witnesses whose evidence was presented as the trial had been complied. This structured approach has helped to understand the cases framework. 29. In evaluating the evidence, the learned High Court Judge has taken a

holistic approach, meaning that the evidence has been assessed in its entirety rather than in isolated sections. This method, has provided a more comprehensive understanding of the facts and their interrelations.

30. The learned High Court Judge has applied the tests of credibility,

corroboration and related criteria. In conducting the analysis, the learned High Court Judge has methodically examined the witness testimonies alongside the physical evidence presented. This evaluation also includes cross-referencing the testimonies with documented evidence to assess the motivations and potential biases of the witnesses.

Page 10 of 10

31. The learned High Court Judge has found that the evidence presented by

the prosecution to be convincing, logical and compelling enough to support the case against the appellants. The learned High Court Judge has stated reasons for disregarding the evidence of the second appellant. The first appellant as stated earlier, has decided to remain silent and also not call witnesses on his behalf.

32. The learned High Court Judge has ultimately concluded that the

prosecution has met its burden of proof regarding the third charge against the appellants. This conclusion has been based on facts elicited from credible prosecution evidence that aligned with the ingredients of the offence convicted of. The sentence imposed afterward is not perverse. 33. In such circumstances, the ground of appeal urged on behalf of the

second appellant must fail. 34. Due to the facts discussed above, I am not inclined to interfere with the

conviction, the disputed judgment together with the sentencing order. I dismiss the appeal. Appeal dismissed. 35. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo for compliance.
