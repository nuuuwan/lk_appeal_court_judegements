JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo as follows:

1. The Appellant was indicted for trafficking 343.08 grams of Heroin

punishable under Section 54(A) (b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

2. In the same transaction the Appellant was indicted for being in

possession of 343.08 grams of Heroin punishable under Section 54(A)

(d) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as

amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

The date of the offence depicted in the indictment is 21.09.2014. Originally,

he was indicted for the trafficking of and for being in possession of 404.92

grams of Heroin. But on 13.09.2016 the indictment was amended and the

quantity of Heroin was brought down to 343.08 grams.

After the trial the Appellant was found guilty on all counts and the learned

High Court Judge of Colombo had sentenced him to life imprisonment on

09/03/2021. The prosecution had called 08 witnesses and marked

productions X1 to X29.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this Court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent for this matter to be argued in his absence. During the

argument he was connected via zoom platform from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal were raised.

1. Evidence of prosecution witnesses failed the test of credibility and

probability.

2. Prosecution had failed to prove the exclusive possession and the chain

of custody of the productions.

3. Learned High Court Judge had rejected the evidence of the defence on

unreasonable grounds.

4. Learned High Court Judge was misdirected on law especially on the

application of Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance and the Burden

of Proof.

Background of the case.

According to PW1, IP Priyadharshana, he was attached to the Borella Police

Station when this raid was conducted. According to him the first information

about the Appellant was received on 25.08.2014 and the raid was conducted

on 21.09.2014.

CA/HCC/0016/2021

According to PW1, the police team had used two private vehicles for this raid.

The car in which PW1 and PW4 travelled was driven by PW9. The three-

wheeler in which PW2 and PW5 travelled was driven by PW6.

The police team had left the Borella Police Station at 14:40 hours and

reached Mihindu Mawatha in Mount Lavinia which was located on the left

side of the Colombo-Galle main road, from their direction of arrival. At about

15:30 hours a van bearing No.253-3358 stopped on the main road to turn to

Mihindu Mawatha. Upon observing this, PW1 instructed the officers in the

three-wheeler to block the van as soon as it entered Mihindu Mawatha. PW4

stepped out of the car to stop the van when it approached the three-wheeler,

but it drove through a gap that was there in front of it. Then PW1 and PW4

had proceeded to shoot at the van, but it had continued moving forward

without stopping. PW1 and PW4 had got into the car and followed the van.

About 150 meters from the place of incident, there was a four-way junction

and due to another car, which entered the road obstructing the van, the van

slowed down. At that time, PW1 had seen a parcel being thrown out of the

van to a plot of land on the right side of the road. Then a person on the land

had picked up the parcel and he had thrown it back at the van which had

missed and had landed on the road instead. Then PW1 had directed PW4 to

collect the parcel and PW1 had chased behind the van with PW9. Another 1

km down the road, the van was overtaken and the Appellant was arrested

and was taken to the four-way junction. At the junction PW4 had handed

over a plastic bag which contained 06 bags of Heroin.

Further investigation was conducted and a statement was recorded from the

wife of the Appellant at his residence. PW1 had then gone to the Dehiwala

Police Station upon a message received to the effect that a Heroin parcel and

a scale had been discovered at the place of the shooting. After that the team

had come to the Borella Police Station and a search was done in the van.

According to PW1, another parcel was found concealed in a small chamber

CA/HCC/0016/2021

5 | P a g e

near the step of the van. Thereafter, the productions were handed over to

PW11 after sealing. On 23.09.2014 PW1 had taken the productions to the

Dehiwala Police Station which were taken into custody by the police officers

there. Thereafter, the productions had been sent to the Government Analyst

for analysis.

Reasonable doubt is legal terminology referring to insufficient evidence that

prevents a judge from convicting a defendant of a crime. In a criminal case,

it is the duty of the prosecution to convince the judge that the defendant is

guilty of the crime with which he has been charged and, therefore, should

be convicted. The phrase "beyond a reasonable doubt" means that the

evidence presented and the arguments put forward by the prosecution

establish the defendant's guilt so clearly that they must be accepted as fact

by any rational person.

In Woolmington v DPP (1935) the Court ruled that in criminal cases, the

burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt

beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant is presumed innocent until

proven guilty, and it is not for the defendant to prove his innocence.

In the first ground of appeal the Learned Counsel contended that the

evidence of prosecution witnesses failed the test of credibility and probability.

In the Attorney General v Sandanam Pitchai Mary Metilda S.C. Appeal

No. 79/2008 decided on 06.05.2010 the Supreme Court held that:

When considering the testimonial creditworthiness of Matilda, it is

important to bear in mind established principles on witness credibility

which may guide the Court in assessing the facts in situation where

conflicting evidence is presented. The Court must be conscious of the

fact that not all witnesses are reliable. A witness may fabricate or

provide a distorted account of the evidence through a personal interest

or through genuine error (Vide, Emson, Evidence, 3rd Edition, 2006).

CA/HCC/0016/2021

6 | P a g e

A key test of credibility is whether the witness is an interested or

disinterested witness. Rajaratnam J. in Tudor Perera v. AG (SC 23/75

D.C. Colombo Bribery 190/B Minutes of S.C. Dated 1/11/1975)

observed that when considering the evidence of an interested witness

who may desire to conceal the truth, such evidence must be scrutinized

with some care. The independent witness will normally be preferred to

an interested witness in case of conflict. Matters of motive, prejudice,

partiality, accuracy, incentive, and reliability have all to be weighed

(Vide, Halsbury Laws of England 4th Edition para 29). Therefore, the

relative weight attached to the evidence of an interested witness who is

a near relative of the accused or whose interests are closely identified

with one party may not prevail over the testimony of an independent

witness (Vide, Hasker v. Summers (1884) 10 V.L.R. (Eq.) 204 Australia;

Leefunteum v. Beaudoin (1897)28 S.C.R. 89) - Canada).

The overall consistency of evidence is a further test of creditworthiness.

Consistency is not just limited to consistency inter se but also

consistency with what is agreed and clearly shown to have occurred

(Vide, Bhoj Raj v. Sita Ram, AIR 1936 PC 60). The Court may also

determine credibility based on the relative probability of the defence

version taking place in light of the evidence before Court.

According to PW1, when the van entered Mihindu Mawatha and the police

team tried to stop the van, it proceeded without stopping. As such the police

opened fire but could not stop the van. At that time, PW1 had not seen

anything being thrown out from the van. PW1 had only seen a bag being

thrown when the van reached a four-way junction. But according to the

Dehiwala Police, they had recovered a parcel and a scale at the place of

shooting. But this was not witnessed either by PW1 or PW4 who shot at the

van when it proceeded without stopping.

CA/HCC/0016/2021

7 | P a g e

Next, according to PW1, when the van reached the four-way junction, he had

seen a parcel being thrown to a land situated on the right side of the road.

Then a person on the land had picked up the parcel and he had thrown it

back at the van which had missed and fallen on the road instead. This had

been seen by the witnesses.

It should be noted the alleged parcel of Heroin is last seen by the witnesses

in the hands of the person who picked up and threw back at the van.

PW1, in his evidence told Court that the statement of the person who picked

up and threw the parcel back to the van, had been recorded but he was not

called to give evidence by the prosecution. Considering the circumstances of

this case he is an essential witness, because it connects the Appellant with

the Heroin said to have been recovered from the road. Without his evidence,

the Heroin parcel said to have thrown out of the van cannot be connected to

this case.

Witnesses are a critical part of criminal trials. Strong testimony from even

one good witness can sometimes make or break the prosecutions case. To

arrive at a fair decision, all essential evidence must be produced by the

prosecution.

In Stephen Seneviratne v The King [1936] 3 All ER 36 at 46 where Lord

Roche said:

Witnesses essential to the unfolding of the narrative on which the

prosecution is based, must, of course, be called by the prosecution,

whether in the result the effect of their testimony is for or against the case

for the prosecution.

Considering the above cited judgment, the person who threw the parcel back

towards the van, of course, is an essential witness and the prosecution

should have called him to give evidence. Not calling the said witness to give

evidence has caused great prejudice to the Appellant.

CA/HCC/0016/2021

Further, a police officer called SI/Weerasinghe from the Dehiwala Police

Station had gone to the place of shooting and with the assistance of the

people of the area, recovered another parcel of Heroin which weighed 100

grams, a digital scale and some polythene bags which also have been accrued

to the Appellant. Further, to prove this recovery, no witnesses from the

Dehiwala Police Station were called by the prosecution.

The learned High Court Judge in his judgment at page 589-590 of the brief

analysed the defence position in this regard as follows:

The analysis of the learned High Court Judge regarding the failure of the

prosecution to call an essential witness to give evidence has caused great

prejudice to the Appellant and I consider it is a clear misdirection.

CA/HCC/0016/2021

9 | P a g e

Further, both PW1 and PW4 confirmed of presence of two military personnel

at Mihindu Mawatha where the shooting incident had taken place. Though

both witnesses thought that there was an army camp situated close-by, they

had later realised that only two army personnel were present at that time.

But the police had failed to record their statement even though a shooting

had taken place. This too raises serious doubts regarding the occurrence of

the incident as described by PW1 and PW4. Culmination of all these factors

raise reasonable doubts about the probability of the incident and the

credibility of the witnesses. Therefore, the 1st ground of appeal has merit.

Chain of custody refers to the documentation that establishes a record of the

control, transfer, and disposition of evidence in a criminal case. In drug

related cases, the prosecution does not only need to prove the case beyond a

reasonable doubt but also ensure, with cogent evidence that the inward

journey of the production has not been disturbed at the all-material point.

To prove someone guilty for the possession and trafficking of drugs, a

prosecutor must prove that the evidence presented in court is the same

evidence that was gathered at the time of the arrest of the accused. They

must be able to show that the evidence was handled properly and was not

contaminated or tampered with. If law enforcement officers do not handle

the recovered evidence in a proper manner, the evidence can be challenged

on the grounds that it was tampered with, that test results are faulty or

inaccurate, or that evidence was planted at the time of arrest. As the criminal

prosecution rely on evidence gathered by police officers, it is typically

prosecutors who must establish the chain of custody.

Proving the chain of custody can be difficult. If law enforcement officers do

not conduct it in a proper manner, chain of custody can be successfully

challenged in a criminal case.

CA/HCC/0016/2021

10 | P a g e

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although we

take serious view in regard to offences relation to drugs, we are of the view

that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to fill the gaps of

badly handled prosecutions where the identity of the good analysis for

examination has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. A prosecutor

should take pains to ensure that the chain of events pertaining to the

productions that had been taken charge from the Appellant from the time

it was taken into custody to the time it reaches the Government Analyst

and comes back to the court should be established.

The learned Counsel takes up the position that the learned Trial Judge

misdirected himself by failure to analyse the discontinuation of custody in

the production chain, which is a substantial fact the prosecution must prove

beyond a reasonable doubt and thereby the conviction is bad in law and

unsafe.

According to PW1, he had only seen the parcel being thrown out of the van

and the parcel was recovered by PW4. But in his evidence at page 134, PW1

had stated that he had instructed one PC Ruwan to retrieve the parcel and

to hold it in his custody. According to PW1 no such person participated in

the raid. Hence, it is not clear as to how PW4 received the parcel. This

missing link was not considered by the learned High Court Judge.

As stated above another parcel was recovered by the Dehiwala Police from

the scene of shooting which PW1 and PW4 had not seen.

Although the shooting incident, the recovery of a parcel of Heroin from the

road by PW4 and the recovery of a parcel of Heroin by Dehiwala Police at the

place of shooting comes under the police division of Dehiwala, the

investigation was conducted by the Borella Police Station. To corroborate

about the shooting incident and the recovery of the parcel of Heroin at the

place of shooting, the prosecution had not called any witnesses to

CA/HCC/0016/2021

11 | P a g e

substantiate this position. But the Heroin parcel recovered from the place of

shooting had been amalgamated with the Heroin parcels said to have been

recovered by PW4. This raises very serious doubts about the recovery of

Heroin as described by the prosecution.

Further, following the alleged arrest and the subsequent recovery of Heroin,

the raiding party had returned to the Dehiwela Police Station in the van along

with the Appellant, but had not done any examination of the van at the

Dehiwala Police Station. According to PW1, the van had been inspected at

the Borella Police Station after about five and a half hours of the shooting

incident and a Heroin parcel was then recovered from the van. Therefore, I

conclude that the prosecution had failed to prove the exclusive possession

and chain of custody of the productions in this case beyond a reasonable

doubt. The learned High Court Judge had failed to consider these matters

which are substantial enough to vitiate the conviction in this case. Hence, I

find that this ground too has merit.

In the 3rd and 4th grounds of appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel had

contended that the learned High Court Judge had rejected the evidence of

the defence on unreasonable grounds.

The learned Presidents Counsel citing the following portion of the judgement

at page 592 of the brief, contended that the learned High Court Judge before

analysing and considering the defence case had come to the conclusion that

the prosecution had proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt.

Considering the above portion of the judgment cited, it clearly demonstrates

that the Appellant had been deprived a fair trial.

CA/HCC/0016/2021

12 | P a g e

Our Apex Court has given clear guidelines as to the consideration of a dock

statement of an accused in a criminal trial.

An accused person has a right to make a statement from the dock. Although

the accused cannot be cross examined, the statement has to be considered

as evidence.

In Queen v. Buddharakkita Thero 63 NLR 433 the court held that:

That the right of an accused person to make an unsworn statement

from the dock is recognized in our law. That right would be of no value

unless such statement is treated as evidence on behalf of the accused,

subject however to the infirmity which attaches to statements that are

unsworn and have not been tested by cross-examination.

Although the learned High Court Judge had considered the dock statement

of the Appellant in his judgment, he has arrived at his own conclusion in

dealing with it. This too deprives a fair trial to the Appellant which is

guaranteed under the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of

Sri Lanka.

The single most important criterion in evaluating the fairness of a trial is the

observance of the principle of equality of arms between the defence and the

prosecution. Equality of arms, which must be observed throughout the trial,

means that both parties are treated in a manner ensuring their procedurally

equal position during the course of a trial. Hence, this ground too has merit.

For the reasons stated above, I am of the view that there is merit in the

grounds of appeal urged by the learned Presidents Counsel in favour of the

Appellant. The evidence presented by the prosecution failed to establish that

the Appellant is guilty of the charges that were levelled against him beyond

reasonable doubt.

CA/HCC/0016/2021

13 | P a g e

Due to aforesaid reasons, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by

learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 09/03/2021 on the Appellant.

Therefore, he is acquitted from the respective charges.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar is directed to send this judgment to the High Court of Colombo

along with the original case record.
