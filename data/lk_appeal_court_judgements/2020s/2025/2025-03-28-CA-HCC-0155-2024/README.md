JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Polonnnaruwa on the following charge namely, committing the offence of

statutory rape on Herath Mudiyanselage Thilini Madhushika Herath on or

before the 19th of February 2013, within the jurisdiction of the court which

is an offence punishable under Section 364(2) of the Penal Code.

After the trial, the Appellant was convicted as charged and was sentenced to

12 years Rigorous Imprisonment and a fine of Rs.25,000/-, in default of

which 12 months simple imprisonment was imposed. Further, a sum of

Rs.400,000/- was ordered as compensation with a default term of 24 months

simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. Also, at the time of

argument the Appellant was connected via zoom platform from prison.

The Counsel for the Appellant advanced the following grounds of appeal:

1. The prosecution has failed to prove the date of offence beyond a

reasonable doubt.

2. The prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.

3. The learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the prosecutrix

had a reason to implicate the Appellant.

4. The learned trial Judge has grievously erred in law by shifting the

burden of proof to the Appellant.

5. The learned High Court Judge misdirected himself on facts and law.

6. The DNA evidence was improperly admitted to the trial.

Background of the case

In this case the prosecutrix was 14 years old at the time of this grave crime.

The Appellant is a neighbour of the victim. On the morning of the day of the

incident in question the Appellant had made a proposal to the victim that

they elope together. As the victim had rejected the proposal, the Appellant

had entered her house through the kitchen entrance on the same day around

6.00 p.m. When the victim had entered the room, the Appellant had taken

off his shirt. The victim had not been able to recall anything thereafter, but

remembers seeing the Appellant leaving with his shirt on.

Although she said narrated the above at the beginning of her examination-

in-chief, later down the line she had said that the Appellant had kissed her

face and had inserted his penis into her genital area. Before his departure,

he had told the victim not to divulge this incident to her mother and had left

the after putting his shirt on.

PW2, the mother of the victim had come home around 6.30 p.m. that day.

Thereafter, as she was washing the clothes of the victim and she had noticed

blood marks on them. When she inquired regarding this from the victim, she

had rather reluctantly, divulged the incident to PW2, but that too only after

CA/HCC 155/24

midnight. Therefore, the complaint was lodged on the following day at the

Medirigiriya Police.

PW8, the JMO who examined the victim noted a fresh hymenal tear on the

six oclock position in the victims vagina.

After the closing of the prosecution case, the defence was called and the

Appellant had given evidence from the witness box and denied that such an

incident took place. The Appellant took up the position that he was falsely

implicated and he had divulged that the victim had had a love affair with a

person called Indika.

Under the first ground of appeal the Appellant contended that the

prosecution had failed to prove the date of offence beyond a reasonable

doubt.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant highlighting a certain portion of the

evidence given by the victim submitted that the victim had failed to mention

the date of the offence correctly.

It is not disputed that the complaint to the police was lodged on 20.02.2013.

The victim in her evidence said that she had divulged the incident to her

mother after midnight. According to PW2, she had come to know the incident

at the early hours of the day and lodged the complaint that day morning.

In Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat (supra) the court held further:

In regard to exact time of an incident, or the time duration of an

occurrence, usually, people make their estimates by guess work on the

spur of the moment at the time of interrogation. And one cannot expect

people to make very precise or reliable estimates in such matters.

It is unrealistic to expect a witness to be a human tape recorder.

CA/HCC 155/24

In R. v. Dossai 13 Cr.App.R. 158 the court held that:

A date specified in an indictment is not a material matter unless it is

an essential part of the alleged offence; the defendant may be convicted

although the jury finds that the offence was committed on a date other

than that specified in the indictment. Amendment of the indictment is

unnecessary, although it will be good practice to do so (provided that

there is no prejudice below) where it is clear on the evidence that if the

offence was committed at all, it was committed on the day other than

that specified.

As the Appellant had been given sufficient notice regarding the date of offence

and plausible evidence was led through witnesses regarding the date, I

conclude no prejudice or failure of justice was caused to the Appellant.

Hence, this ground of appeal has no merit.

As the 2nd to 5th grounds of appeal are interconnected all grounds will be

considered together hereinafter.

In a criminal case, the prosecution is responsible for proving the defendant's

guilt to the jury and demonstrating that a conviction is justified. The phrase

"beyond a reasonable doubt" means that the evidence and arguments

presented by the prosecution must be so strong and convincing that any

rational person would accept the defendants guilt as fact. This standard

ensures that no reasonable uncertainty remains before a conviction is made.

In the case of State of Andra Pradesh v. Garigula Satya Vani Murthy AIR

1997 SC 1588, it was held that:

the courts are expected to show great responsibility while trying an

accused on a charge of rape. They must deal with such cases with

utmost sensitivity.

The victim was only 14 years old when she was raped. She had given evidence

about the incident accurately without any contradiction or omission.

CA/HCC 155/24

6 | P a g e

Although she had not come out with the complete recount of the incident at

the beginning, she had given evidence properly in the later stages of the trial.

Hence, it cannot be said that the victim had provided two different versions

sufficient to create a reasonable doubt.

The Appellant in his evidence stated that he is a disabled soldier who had

sustained injuries during the war. To substantiate the said claim, he had

marked his medical report as V1. Hence, the learned Counsel argued that

due to his disability he could not have grappled or pulled a person thereby

denied committing statutory rape.

It is well settled law that if an accused person is engaging a defence or taking

up a certain position, that that position must be put to the witnesses and

when they are giving evidence.

In Sarwan Singh v. State of Punjab [2002] AIR Supreme Court iii 3652 at

36755,3656, it was observed;

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has decline to

avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross examination it must

follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted.

This case was cited with approval in the case of Boby Mathew v. State of

Karnataka [2004] 3 Cri.L.J. 3003.

As the Appellant had not put his medical condition to the prosecution

witnesses when they gave evidence, the court has to consider only that the

proposition was put to the witnesses during the cross examination.

The prosecutrix in her evidence admitted that she had an affair with a person

called Indika and that they were caught while in an abandoned house

through the information provided by the Appellant. Although the Counsel for

the Appellant contended that this led to the victim to implicate the Appellant

in this case, the victim had never mentioned that she had any animosity with

the Appellant over this incident.

CA/HCC 155/24

In State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh [1996] 2 SCC 384 it was held that:

The courts must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the fact that

in a case of rape, no self-respecting woman would come forward in a

court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour.

Next the Counsel for the Appellant contended that the learned trial Judge

has grievously erred in law by shifting the burden of proof to the Appellant

thereby reversing the presumption of innocence which occasioned in the

deprivation of a fair trial.

Upon perusal of the judgment nowhere had, the learned High Court reversed

the burden of proof and placed it upon the Appellant. The learned High Court

Judge had accurately considered the evidence presented by the prosecution

and the defence and concluded that the Appellant is guilty of the charge.

When an accused is facing a serious criminal charge it is essential that every

point in favour of the accused, though it may seem trivial, should be placed

before the Judge. It may well be that all such matters, if so, placed before

the judge may create a reasonable doubt, the benefit of which should accrue

to the accused.

In this case the learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence given

by the prosecutrix and the defence and had arrived at the conclusion that

the evidence given by the prosecutrix is convincing and reliable and

therefore, the prosecution had proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt.

Finally, the Appellant contended that the admission of the DNA Report

without the consent of the defence has caused great prejudice to him.

According to the DNA Report no any incriminating evidence was found

against the Appellant. As such, this too had not caused any prejudice to the

Appellant.

After careful perusal of the evidence presented during the trial, I am of the

view that the evidence presented by the prosecution is not tainted with any

CA/HCC 155/24

8 | P a g e

serious shortcomings or ambiguity. Therefore, it is safe to act on such

evidence of the prosecution against the Appellant.

As discussed under the grounds of appeal advanced by the Appellant, the

prosecution had adduced strong and incriminating evidence against the

Appellant. The learned High Court Judge had accurately analyzed all the

evidence presented by both parties to arrive at the conclusion that the

prosecution has indeed proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt.

As the learned High Court Judge had rightly convicted the Appellant for the

charge levelled against him in the indictment, and I affirm the conviction and

dismiss the Appeal of the Appellant.

The Registrar is directed to send this judgment to High Court of Polonnaruwa

along with the original case record.
