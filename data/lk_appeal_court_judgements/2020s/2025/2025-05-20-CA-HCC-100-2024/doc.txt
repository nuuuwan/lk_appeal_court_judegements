JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) has

been indicted in the High Court of Hambantota in High Court case no.

HC 70/2016. The charges in the indictment are as follows;

i. On or about 14.04.2013, at Gallawila, within the jurisdiction of

common object to cause hurt to one Weerappuli Gamage Suraj

Rangana Dinesh and thereby committed an offence punishable

under section 140 of the Penal Code.

ii. At the same date, place and in the course of the same transaction,

you while being members of the said unlawful assembly caused

the death of one Weerappuli Gamage Suraj Rangana Dinesh in

prosecution of the common object of the assembly or such as the

members of that assembly knew that it was likely to be committed

and you being members of the said unlawful assembly at the time

Page 3 of 13

of the commission of said offence, thereby committed an offence

punishable under section 296 read with section 146 of the Penal

Code.

iii. At the same date, place and in the course of the same transaction,

you caused the death of one Weerappuli Gamage Suraj Rangama

Dinesh and thereby committed an offence punishable under

section 296 read with section 32 of the Penal Code.

2. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge has

convicted the appellant of the third charge and sentenced him to death.

3. The accused-appellant being aggrieved by the conviction and

sentencing order has preferred the instant appeal to this Court.

Case of the prosecution

4. On 14.04.2013, the appellant in a drunkard rage has gone to the

residence of PW 04. Upon arrival, the appellant has made the utterance

and has been carrying a knife at

that time. Without a provocation, the appellant has proceeded to stab

a dog that was lying near PW 04. Following this act, the deceased and

others had gathered at the location where the appellant was present.

Subsequently, an exchange of blows have occurred between the

appellant and the deceased, along with the individuals who had

assembled with the deceased. As a result, the deceased has sustained

injuries and hospitalized. While receiving treatment as an indoor

patient, the deceased has ultimately passed away. Officers attached to

the Hambantota Police have conducted investigations into the incident

and a post-mortem examination has been performed by PW13, Dr. D. T.

Silva, Judicial Medical Officer attached to the Hambantota General

Page 4 of 13

Hospital at that time, at the mortuary of the hospital beginning 01.45

pm on 15.04.2013. The post-mortem report has been marked -1.

Case of the appellant

5. The appellant has maintained that the deceased along with another 10

individuals armed with blunt weapons (such as poles) assaulted him.

6. During the altercation, the deceased has attempted to stab the

appellant with a knife, that he was carrying. The appellant has tried to

take the knife away but could not recall what happened next as he was

in a state of intoxication. He has asserted that he did not stab the

deceased or any other person. Although the appellant has been arrested

by the police, he has also been hospitalized due to the injuries he has

sustained.

Grounds of appeal

7. The Learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant has urged the

following grounds of appeal;

i. Has the prosecution failed to prove the charge of murder against

the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt?

ii. Has the Learned High Court Judge not taken into consideration

matters favourable to the accused and thereby has a miscarriage

of justice occurred?

Page 5 of 13

iii. Has the Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself in

analyzing the plea of voluntary intoxication under section 79 of

the Penal Code?

iv. Has the Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself in not

considering the plea of sudden fight in its proper perspective?

8. The Learned Presidents Counsel has argued that PW 04s narrative

reveals an incident of a sudden fight between the appellant and the

deceased. The circumstances surrounding the deceaseds injuries

which ultimately led to his death indicate that it was a sudden fight.

Although the exception of sudden fight was not specifically raised, such

fact did not relieve the Learned High Court Judge of the burden to

consider that aspect of the case. By failing to take such fact into

account, the Learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself and

has occasioned in a failure of justice.

9. The Learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the

respondent has not disputed the arguments made on behalf of the

appellant.

10. Section 294 of the Penal Code provide for conditions where a homicide

can be mitigated from murder to culpable homicide. It lays out several

exceptions that may not exonerate the offender but can lessen the

offence.

11. Exception 4 to Section 294 of the Penal Code provides that,

Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon

Page 6 of 13

sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue

advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

Explanation It is immaterial in such cases which party

offers the provocation or commits the first assault.

12. When involving the sudden fight exception, certain elements needs to

be established;

i. Sudden fight: the incident must be unexpected and

arise suddenly, without any prior planning.

ii. Absence of pre-meditation: the offender must not have

deliberated or planned the homicide beforehand, the

action should occur in the heat of the moment,

iii. No undue advantage: the offender should not exploit

the situation or have an unfair advantage over the

victim, ensuring a degree of evenness in the

confrontation or,

iv. The offender should not act in a cruel or unusual

manner.

13. The narrative of PW 04 relevant in this instance is as follows,

[vide pages 89 and 90 of the Brief]

Page 7 of 13

[vide page 126 of the Brief]

[vide pages 129 and 130 of the Brief]

[vide page 115 of the Brief]

Page 8 of 13

[vide page 116 of the Brief]

[vide page 127 of the Brief]

14. It is evident that the appellant in a drunken rage has gone to the

residence of PW 04. Upon his arrival, the deceased along with a crowd

of 10 or more others have gathered around the appellant. This crowd

including the deceased have been armed with blunt weapons such as

poles. Furthermore, PW 04 has conceded that the individuals in the

crowd could have had other kinds of weapons also, that she was unable

Page 9 of 13

to observe. As a result of the gathering, the confrontation has ensured

between the appellant and the deceased along with others present

leading to blows being exchanged. It is also clear that sharp edged

weapons have been used during this altercation as both the appellant

and the deceased have sustained stab injuries from the incident. The

post-mortem report marked -1 and the medical report marked 1V2

substantiate these claims.

15. Where the exception of sudden fights is pleaded it is immaterial as to

which party offers the provocation or commits the initial assault. This

principal is set out explicitly in an explanation to exception 4.

16. The events referred to implying that the bilateral transaction during

which blows were exchanged was neither prearranged nor planned. The

fight has been a sudden occurrence showing no significant lapse of time

between the utterance, the gathering of the deceased along with others

and the exchange of blows. It appears to be that there has been

insufficient time for passion to subside, thus the act that caused the

fatal injuries to the deceased cannot be deemed premeditated. To

Page 10 of 13

constitute premeditation, a killing should be predetermined and

calculated after careful consideration, not a sudden act driven by

momentary excitement and impulse following a provocation given at the

time or shortly before the event, allowing little time for reflection.

17. Furthermore, both parties, each armed with weapons, including sharp

edged weapons have engaged in the fight, resulting in stab injuries to

both the deceased and the appellant. Therefore, it cannot be concluded

that either has acted unusually.

18. Although the defence of sudden fight was not explicitly raised, it does

not absolve a trial judge of the responsibility to consider such a matter

if the evidence presented during the trial suggests its relevance.

19. In King vs. Vidanalage Lanty 42 NLR 319, Moseley, J, has stated,

It is the duty of the presiding Judge to have so

directed the jury and that in the circumstances, the

appellant was entitled to have the benefit of a lesser

verdict.

Page 11 of 13

20. The narrative provided by PW 04 suggests that the appellant was in a

drunkenness rage. However, it is important to note that there is a lack

of evidence to support the fact that the appellant was so intoxicated

that it rendered him incapable of forming a murderous intention at the

time the altercation occurred. While alcohol can impair judgment and

emotional control, the critical issue at hand is whether the appellants

level of intoxication was sufficient to negate his ability to premeditate

or act with intent to kill. The absence of compelling evidence

demonstrating that the appellant had reached a degree of impairment

that would hinder his capacity for rational thought is a significant

factor. Without definitive proof of impairment that would preclude the

formation of murderous intent, the narrative of PW 04 alone would not

be sufficient to substantiate such fact.

21. In Kumarasinghe vs. The State 77 NLR 218, H. N. G. Fernando.

C.J. (as he then was), has observed as follows;

Any of the five Exceptions specified in Section 294 of

the Penal Code (including Exceptions dealing with

provocation and sudden fight) is applicable in a case, and

Page 12 of 13

only in a case, in which an accused has caused death with

the murderous intention; if the mitigating circumstances set

out in any of these Exceptions are establishedthe effect

of such an Exception is that the accused is guilty only

of culpable homicide not amounting to murder despite

the fact that he did entertain a murderous intention.

Therefore, according to his Lordships observation, when mitigating

circumstances as outlined in the exceptions to section 294 are

established, an accused person is guilty solely of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder even if he had the intention to cause the death of

the deceased, intention to inflict injury to or sufficient in the ordinary

course of nature to cause the death of the deceased or possessed

knowledge that his actions would likely result in the death of the

deceased as stipulated in section 294 of the Penal Code.

22. Based on the reasons outlined above, I set aside the appellants

conviction of murder along with the accompanying death sentence,

Page 13 of 13

instead I convict the appellant of culpable homicide not amounting to

murder and impose the following sentence;

I sentence the appellant to 12 years of rigorous imprisonment

and impose a fine of Rs.25,000. In the event of default in

paying the fine, the appellant shall face an additional term of

2 years imprisonment. The substantive term of 12 years of

rigorous imprisonment shall commence on 08.02.2024, the

date of conviction.

23. The appeal is dismissed subject to the above variation.

24. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the

High Court of Hambantota for compliance.
