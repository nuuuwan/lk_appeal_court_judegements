JUDGEMENT

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J

1. The petitioner is currently a student of Kingswood College, Kandy, and

is a talented rugby player and sportsman. He joined Kingswood College

in March 2024 to Grade 13, and upon joining, the petitioner was

desirous to participate in sports, especially rugby. However, as per the

Circular marked X-19 issued by the Ministry of Education, being

Circular No. 03 of 2022, there is a requirement to obtain a No Objection

Letter from all the Principals of the schools in which such a student has

been during the preceding year. This is provided for by Rule 1.1.9 of the

said Circular. It reads as follows:

1.1.9 /

/

, . 6

12

1.1.8 .

2. The petitioner has sought the said No Objection Letter, however the 1st

respondent Principal of Vidyartha College, by letter X-26 dated

09.04.2025, granted consent for the petitioner to participate in football,

however, had given several reasons as to why he cannot issue the No

Objection Letter in respect of rugby. The tenor of the said letter X-26 is

that the Principal has not issued the No Objection Letter to the

petitioner to play rugby for Kingswood College.

3. According to the learned Counsel for the petitioner, the 1st respondent

Principal was summoned for an inquiry at the Human Rights

Commission Sub-Office in Kandy. This was to inquire into the non-

issue of the Leaving Certificate as well as the No Objection Letter.

According to X-7, the application to the Human Rights Commission, the

WRT/0616/25

Page 4 of 15

letter annexed thereto, it is evident that the complaint and the relief

expected includes both the obtaining of the Leaving Certificate as well

as the No Objection Letter to engage in sports upon joining the new

school (item 20 of X-7).

4. The inquiry had been held on 07.02.2025. The inquiry notes are found

in page 98, marked X-13, according to which the 1st respondent has

informed that the Leaving Certificate could be issued. However, as for

the No Objection Letter, the 1st respondent appears to have informed

that if such a Circular containing such a requirement is brought to his

notice, he could consider that request as well (vide X-14). The relevant

portion as recorded by the HRC proceedings, marked X-13 reads as

follows:

,

.

.

.

5. After the said inquiry, the petitioner has met the 1st respondent and

requested for the Leaving Certificate as well as the No Objection Letter.

The 1st respondent has by letter X-18, dated 21.02.2025, informed the

HRC that he is not in a position to issue the Leaving Certificate due to

the poor academic performance, and also alleged that the petitioner has

unlawfully participated in the rugby match between Kingswood College

and Maliyadewa College, Kurunegala, and that there is a pending

disciplinary inquiry; as such, there is a difficulty to issue the Leaving

Certificate. However, the Leaving Certificate X-4 was issued on

06.03.2025. There is no mention of any matter as reflected in X-18, in

the Leaving Certificate. Thereafter, the 1st respondent has issued X-26,

on 09.04.2025, by which he had informed that he had no objection to

WRT/0616/25

Page 5 of 15

the petitioner participating in football, but he had not granted his No

Objection Letter in respect of rugby.

6. The petitioners application is based on legitimate expectation arising

from the holding out and the undertaking that appears in X-14, and

also it was submitted that the refusal is unreasonable and is based on

extraneous considerations. Further it was submitted that in view of the

provisions of Rule 1.1.9, the 1st respondent is not empowered to grant

the no objection on a conditional or selective basis for a particular sport

only. It is the submission that the no objection should be granted in

relation to sports in general. As opposed to this, the learned DSG, Mr.

Manohara Jayasinghe submitted that the rationale in promulgating the

Rule 1.1.9 is to prevent what is popularly known as poaching of

talented players. It is an open secret that schools induce and attract

talented sportsmen from other schools to enhance and boost their

respective teams. In this context, Mr. Jayasinghe submitted that

selective No Objection Letters can be issued in that form and in fact,

such selective no objection would in the end enure to the benefit of the

student concerned. He vehemently submitted that the 1st respondent

has never acted maliciously and in fact that he did consent and agree

to the petitioner playing two rugby matches for Kingswood College after

this application was filed.

7. The letter X-26 certainly is a selective No Objection Letter, where the 1st

respondent provides his consent/no objection only in respect of

football. He clearly withholds providing his consent/no objection in

respect of rugby. I would now consider if the withholding of his no

objection is reasonable. On the face of X-26, the primary emphasis is

placed on the large sums of money allocated and incurred to develop

rugby. The amount spent during 2023 and 2024 are Rs. 2.6 million and

2.9 million respectively. Further, the Old Boys too have spent Rs. 16.2

million. The 1st respondent places great emphasis on this enormous

amount spent for the advancement of rugby in refusing to issue the No

Objection Letter. Thereafter he has also mentioned that there may be

WRT/0616/25

Page 6 of 15

others who may so leave and this will be to the detriment of the schools

sports and the morale of other students, teachers, and

trainers/coaches. To my mind, the fact that an enormous sum being

expended for the promotion and advancement of rugby and rugby

players is not a reasonable or relevant ground to withhold consent.

Spending large amounts and allocating such sums by the school and

by Old Boys may be the current trend, but financial commitments made

by the school and others cannot be a fetter or a valid reason to prevent

a talented player in engaging in sports activities after moving to another

school, even mid-stream. This will relegate talented students to the

position of bonded labourers, so to say. This cannot be and is not the

object of Rule 1.1.9 of the Circular.

8. The primary driving force and consideration being financial is evident

and clear from the complaint and statements made to the Human

Rights Commission (hereinafter referred to as HRC). According to X-

7, the application to the HRC, it is evident that the 1st respondent is

alleged to have refused to issue both the Leaving Certificate and the No

Objection Letter as per paragraph 20 of X-7.

9. X-8a is a written complaint made by the petitioner to the HRC. This

narrates in detail the undue pressure and threats perpetrated by an

Old Boy who appears to have been assisting the school rugby at

Vidyartha College by providing financial assistance. Therefore, the issue

of providing funds and financial assistance has been a primary

consideration that has been present from the very inception of this

dispute, and it appears to be the main consideration and reason for the

refusal to issue the No Objection Letter. This is manifested once again,

in X-26, as being the main reason for the refusal to grant the No

Objection Letter.

10. The rationale and object of Rule 1.1.9 is certainly to prevent poaching

of sportsmen. However, a student who is talented in sports cannot be

deprived or denied an opportunity to join a school which such student

believes to be offering better opportunities. However, in such

WRT/0616/25

Page 7 of 15

circumstance, when such talented sportsmen move mid-stream, the

Principal of the first school is entitled to withhold his No Objection Letter

to discourage such poaching. This object and the basis should be

manifested and be evident as the primary and pivotal consideration.

However, as stated above, the primary and foremost reason stated in X-

26 is the financial commitment and the expense. The decision to grant

a conditional No Objection Letter, and specifically to not issue the No

Objection Letter in respect of rugby, is clearly based on financial

reasons. This, to my mind, is an irrelevant and extraneous consideration

rendering the decision ultra vires and unreasonable.

11. The 1st respondent at the HRC has clearly held out that if there be a

Circular empowering him to issue a No Objection Letter and if it is

brought to his notice, that he may consider the necessity of issuing the

same, which is as follows:

,

. This is a manifestation and

holding out that 1st respondent would consider the issuing such letter if

the Circular was brought to his notice. The petitioners position is that

this, to some extent, creates an expectation that the 1st respondent will

grant the No Objection Letter in due course. The learned DSG takes the

view that this utterance at the HRC is no more than an indication that

he would consider the request if there is a mandatory requirement.

12. According to the objections, the 1st respondent does not deny the

contents of the Inquiry Notes and proceedings of the HRC as depicted in

X-13. However, at paragraph 12 and 24, the 1st respondent gives his

interpretation of what he claims to have meant when he said so. The

respondents position is that he was aware of the Circular well before

that day, however, the respondent was not aware of any Circular which

makes the issuance of the said No Objection Letter mandatory, thereby

casting a legal obligation on him a legal obligation which can be enforced

by a writ of mandamus. At paragraph 24, the respondent avers that what

WRT/0616/25

Page 8 of 15

was meant by him before the HRC is that he would issue the No

Objection Letter upon being shown a Circular which made the issuance

of the same mandatory.

13. I have reproduced the relevant portion of the proceedings hereinabove.

On plain reading, it is apparent and clear that the respondent is alleged

to have informed the petitioner to make available a copy of such

Circular, if any, and if so, he would consider the issuing of the said No

Objection Letter. Further, the said Inquiry Notes state that upon the

receipt of such Circular, the respondent is required to report within two

weeks as regards to the issue of the said No Objection Letter. If the 1st

respondent was aware beforehand of the Circular X-19, then he ought

to have known if there was a provision which provides for the issue of

such a letter. If the interpretation of the 1st respondent is accepted, it

demonstrates a clear malicious disposition on his part by throwing a

challenge to the petitioner, so to say. The HRC complaint has been made

in November 2024. The 1st respondent has been notified to appear by

letter X-8, dated 17.12.2024. That being so, by 07.02.2025, the 1st

respondent had sufficient time to have ascertained the relevant Circular

and of any other relevant amendment if any. The utterance, throwing in

the face of a student a challenge to provide a copy of the Circular, clearly

demonstrates that the 1st respondent was not well-disposed and was

malicious. It was his duty if at all to consider the relevant Circular and

inform his decision either way. The fact that he throws this challenge at

the HRC Inquiry demonstrates some arrogance and the temperament of

the 1st respondent.

14. In this backdrop, the conduct of the 1st respondent from the very

inception is very relevant. The petitioner, at paragraph 16, specifically

states that he requested for the Leaving Certificate as well as the No

Objection Letter from the 1st respondent in November 2024. The 1st

respondent however, at paragraph 7, denies the petitioners averments

in paragraph 16. However, the complaint to the HRC has been made in

November 2024, as averred in paragraph 18 of the petition. The fact that

WRT/0616/25

Page 9 of 15

the HRC complaint was so made is confirmed by X-7. Then, X-8 confirms

that on 17.12.2024, the 1st respondent was notified of the HRC

complaint. According to X-7 the petitioner had informed that the relief

he is seeking is the obtaining of the Leaving Certificate and the No

Objection Letter. The sum total is that on a consideration of the totality

of this material, it is apparent that the petitioner did in fact request for

the Leaving Certificate as well as the No Objection Letter in November

2024. Therefore, the denial made in paragraph 07 cannot be correct and

true.

15. Upon the 1st respondent being required to report on the progress of the

issue of the No Objection Letter, within two weeks he, by X-18 dated

21.02.2025 informs of certain impediments to issue the Leaving

Certificate. However, on 06.03.2025, the Leaving Certificate is issued. It

neither contains an adverse remark on the petitioners academic

performance, nor any reference to any illegal participation at a rugby

match with Maliyadewa College. Thereafter, the 1st respondent by letter

dated 09.04.2025 (X-26) formally informs that there is no objection in

respect of football, but does not grant the No Objection Letter in respect

of rugby. This letter does not make any reference to the alleged illegal

participation at a rugby match between Kingswood College and

Maliyadewa College. On a consideration of the aforesaid, the 1st

respondent notwithstanding giving an undertaking to consider the issue

of the No Objection Letter as well as the Leaving Certificate, has on

21.02.2025 made two allegations, both of which are not reflected in any

of the subsequent correspondence. If what was alleged in X-18 was in

fact true and in existence, these issues should necessarily be relevant in

issuing the Leaving Certificate as well as the consideration of the No

Objection. Therefore, the allegation made of mala fides cannot be

disregarded in view of the conduct of the 3rd respondent as aforesaid. 16. The substantive basis of the application of the petitioner as it transpired

during the argument is that a legitimate expectation is created by the

utterance and undertaking made by the 1st respondent at the HRC. I

WRT/0616/25

Page 10 of 15

have reproduced the same as recorded in the HRC Inquiry Notes, above.

The 1st respondent does give a different interpretation as stated above.

However, according to the petitioner, it is clearly a holding out or an

undertaking that the 1st respondent would issue the same provided a

particular Circular is made available. The petitioner and the 1st

respondent take up competing interpretations and positions as to the

said utterance. To resolve this, one may get some assistance from letter

X-20. This is a letter written by the HRC to the Secretary of the

Education Ministry of the Central Province, according to which it is

clearly stated that,

.

.

.

17. This clearly depicts that the 1st respondent has in fact agreed to issue

both the Leaving Certificate as well as the No Objection Letter. This read

in conjunction with the HRC Inquiry Notes, it makes it sufficiently

apparent that the 1st respondent has held out and agreed to issue the

No Objection Letter as requested for during the inquiry. This in my view

is sufficient to create a legitimate expectation in the petitioner. I will now

endeavour to consider the legal position and the principle of legitimate

expectation as is relevant to this application. Prof. Craig in

Administrative Law (11th Ed., at pg.22001), defines procedural and

substantive legitimate expectation as follows:

The phrase procedural legitimate expectation denotes the

existence of some process right the applicant claims to possess as

the result of a promise or behaviour by the public body that

generates the expectation The phrase substantive legitimate

expectation captures the situation in which the applicant seeks

WRT/0616/25

Page 11 of 15

a particular benefit or commodity, such as a welfare benefit or a

licence, as the result of some promise, behaviour or representation

made by the public body.

18. The ideology of substantive legitimate expectation originated in the

landmark case of R vs. Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food,

ex parte Hamble (Offshore) Fisheries Ltd. [1995] 2 All ER 714 where

Sedley, J., held as follows:

Legitimacy in this sense is not an absolute. It is a function of

expectations induced by government and of policy considerations

which militate against their fulfilment. The balance must in the first

instance be for the policy maker to strike; but if the outcome is

challenged by way of judicial review, I do not consider that the

Court's criterion is the bare rationality of the policy maker's

conclusion. While policy is for the policy-maker alone, the fairness

of his or her decision not to accommodate reasonable expectations

which the policy will thwart remains the Court's concern (as of

course the lawfulness of the policy). To postulate this is not to

place the judge in the seat of the Minister...but it is equally

the courts duty to protect the interests of those individuals

whose expectation of different treatment has a legitimacy

which in fairness outtops the policy choice which threatens

to frustrate it. [emphasis added].

19. The abovementioned dictum has been cited with approval in

Dayaratne vs. Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine (1999) 1

SLR 393, Nimalsiri vs. Fernando (SC/FR/256/2010, decided on 17th

September 2015), and in M. R. C. C. Ariyarathne and others vs.

Inspector General of Police and others (SC/FR/444/2012, decided

on 30th July 2019). In M. R. C. C. Ariyarathne and others vs.

Inspector General of Police and others (supra), Prasanna

Jayawardena, PC, J., after an extensive and all-encompassing analysis

on the doctrine of legitimate expectation, cited with approval the

following dicta of Dehideniya, J., in the decision of Zamrath vs. Sri

WRT/0616/25

Page 12 of 15

Lanka Medical Council (SC/FR/119/2019, decided on 23.07.2019),

as the rationale underlying the doctrine of legitimate expectation:

The legitimate expectation of a personfurther ensures legal

certainty which is imperative as the people ought to plan their lives,

secure in the knowledge of the consequences of their actions. The

perception of legal certainty deserves protection, as a basic tenet

of the rule of law which this court attempts to uphold as the apex

court of the country. The public perception of legal certainty

becomes negative when the authorities by their own undertakings

and assurances have generated legitimate expectations of people

and subsequently by their own conduct, infringe the so generated

expectations.

Further, in Siriwardane vs. Seneviratne and four others [2011] 2

SLR 1, Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, J. (as she was then) held that,

A careful consideration of the doctrine of legitimate expectation,

clearly shows that, whether an expectation is legitimate or not is a

question of fact. This has to be decided not only on the basis of the

application made by the aggrieved party before court, but also

taking into consideration whether there had been any arbitrary

exercise of power by the administrative authority in question.

20. Considering the above authorities and dicta, I am satisfied that a

legitimate expectation is created in the petitioner. On a consideration of

the sequence of events and the conduct of the 1st respondent, it is clear

and apparent that he had been withholding the issue of both the Leaving

Certificate and the No Objection Letter, up until the petitioner

complained to the HRC. The petitioner clearly had, on many occasions,

requested for the same. However, the Leaving Certificate had been

issued on 06.03.2025. It is relevant to note that the 1st respondent could

not have refused to issue the Leaving Certificate. He had delayed the

issue of the same for almost 04 months. This shows that he was acting

with malice. Thereafter, with the complaint being made to the HRC, his

disposition appears to have further changed which is evident by X-18.

WRT/0616/25

Page 13 of 15

That being so, the primary and substantive reason adduced for the

refusal to issue the No Objection Letter to play rugby is none other than

the substantial sums claimed to have been invested and expended by

the school and the Old Boys. This, to my mind, cannot be a valid or

lawful reason to refuse the issue of the No Objection Letter in respect of

rugby. The object and purpose of the Circular as submitted by the

learned DSG is to prevent poaching of talented players. In letter X-26,

the said reason has been very vaguely mentioned down the line.

Accordingly, the primary reason for the refusal to issue the No Objection

Letter is an extraneous and irrelevant consideration.

21. In this regard, I would refer to the following passage from Administrative

law by Wade and Forsyth (11th Ed., at pg. 323):

There are many cases in which a public authority has been held

to have acted from improper motives or upon irrelevant

considerations, or to have failed to take account of relevant

considerations, so that its action is ultra vires and void. It is

impossible to separate these cleanly from other cases of

unreasonableness and abuse of power, since the court may use a

variety of interchangeable explanations, as was pointed out by

Lord Greene. Regarded collectively, these cases show the great

importance of strictly correct motives and purposes. They show

also how fallacious it is to suppose that powers conferred in

unrestricted language confer unrestricted power.

Further, A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J., in Tennakoon Mudiyanselage Janaka

Bandara Tennakoon vs. Hon. Attorney General and Others

CA/WRT/335/2016, decided on 15th November 2020, held as follows:

In administrative justice, failure to take into account relevant

considerations and taking into account irrelevant considerations

would taint and nullify the decision as illegality which is an aspect

of Wednesbury unreasonableness. Our attention has not been

drawn to any analysis or consideration of these matters before a

decision was made to indict the Petitioner.

WRT/0616/25

Page 14 of 15

The above, considered in conjunction with the conduct of the 1st

respondent which strongly savours of malice, makes the decision not to

issue the No Objection Letter mala fide, ultra vires, and illegal, as it has

relied and is based on extraneous and irrelevant considerations.

22. Accordingly, I hold that the petitioner is entitled to relief as prayed for

by prayers (ii), (vi) and (vii) of the petition and the following writs are

issued:

a. a writ of certiorari as prayed for by paragraph (ii) to quash the

said decision refusing the grant of the No Objection Letter in

respect of rugby as depicted in letter X-26;

b. a writ of mandamus as prayed for by paragraph (vi) directing the

1st respondent to issue a No Objection Letter to the petitioner to

participate and engage in rugby and other sports representing

Kingswood College, Kandy as required by paragraph 1.1.9 of

Circular bearing No. 03 of 2022; and

c. a writ of mandamus as prayed for by paragraph (vii) directing the

5th respondent to register and permit the petitioner for

participation in the Sri Lanka Schools Under 19 Dialog League

Rugby Tournament 2025 representing Kingswood College,

Kandy.

23. The No Objection Letter and registration as directed should be issued

and made not later than 01:30 p.m. of 24.07.2025. To give effect to the

relief as granted, I observe that the 4th respondent Director of Education

Physical Education & Sports of the Ministry of Education is also

required to issue the concurrence as required by Rule 1.1.9 of the

Circular. Accordingly, as a consequential remedy, the 4th respondent is

directed to issue the concurrence.

24. The Registrar is directed to convey this order to the 4th respondent

Director of Education Physical Education & Sports of the Ministry of

WRT/0616/25

Page 15 of 15

Education and the petitioner is permitted a serve a copy of the same on

the said Officer so such Officer can act accordingly.

25. Application is allowed; however I make no order as to costs.
