JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Monaragala

for committing one count of grave sexual abuse on the victim Hewa

Kankanamage Dinusha Maduwanthi, punishable under Section 365(B) 2 (b)

and one count of statutory rape punishable under Section 364(2) of the Penal

Code as amended by Acts No.29 of 1998 and No.16 of 2016.

The trial commenced on 30.09.2019 and after leading all necessary

witnesses, the prosecution had closed the case on 30.11.2022. The learned

High Court Judge had called for the defence on the same day and the

Counsel for the Appellant had moved for a day to call witnesses on his behalf.

The Appellant had made a dock statement and closed his case on

14.02.2023.

The learned High Court Judge after considering the evidence presented by

both parties, convicted the Appellant for the first charge under Section

365(B) (2) (b) of the Penal Code as amended. After calling sentencing

submissions from both parties, the Appellant was sentenced to 08 years

CA/HCC/0195/23

3 | P a g e

rigorous imprisonment and was imposed a fine of Rs.7500/- subject to a

default sentence of 03 months rigorous imprisonment. Additionally, a

compensation of Rs.300,000/- was ordered by the learned High Court Judge

with a default sentence of 06 months rigorous imprisonment. The Appellant

was acquitted from the second charge.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

had given consent to argue this matter in his absence. The Appellant was

connected via Zoom from prison during the argument.

The following grounds of appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant

at the argument.

1. The learned Trial Judge failed to consider that, on the first day of giving

evidence, the victim clearly denied being subjected to any abuse.

However, almost a year later, her testimony changed and matched the

police statement, creating a reasonable doubt as to whether the child

was tutored or influenced after the initial hearing.

2. The Appellant was denied the right to fair trial by taking part of the

evidence of the victim in his chamber and summoning the mother of

the victim, PW2 to the chamber of the judge.

3. The learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that the prosecution did

not summon the victims elder brother, who is, in fact, an eye witness

to the incident, thereby warranting the application of Section 114(F) of

the Evidence Ordinance as amended.

4. The learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that the evidence of the

victim has not been corroborated by any medical evidence.

5. The learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that the evidence of PW1

is not corroborated from any independent source, and her evidence

CA/HCC/0195/23

4 | P a g e

does not inspire confidence. Therefore, the guilt of the Appellant has

not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Background of the case albeit is as follows:

According to the prosecution, the Appellant is a mason by profession and

had committed the alleged offence on the victim while he was attending to

masonry work at the victims house. He had committed the offence when the

victims parents were not at home and had sent the elder brother of the victim

to buy cigarettes from the nearby boutique before committing the offence.

Subsequently, it is alleged that the Appellant had inserted his finger in to

the vagina of the victim. When her brother returned, he had witnessed the

incident and had duly informed PW2. PW2, the mother of the victim, had

lodged the complaint against the Appellant with the Police on the same day

of the incident. The victim was 09 years old when she encountered the ordeal.

PW8, the JMO who examined the victim opined that the victim had not been

subjected to vaginal penetration. But he has not excluded inter labia

penetration.

In this appeal, I decided to consider the 2nd ground of appeal first.

In the Sri Lankan legal system, courts and tribunals may conduct in camera

proceedingsclosed to the publicin circumstances where the protection of

sensitive information or the welfare of vulnerable individuals is paramount.

Such proceedings are most commonly employed in cases involving minors or

matters implicating national security. Access to these hearings is not granted

as a matter of course and must be specifically restricted through a judicial

order.

Article 106 of the Constitution which is stated below is vital in this regard.

(1) The sittings of every court, tribunal or other institution established

under the Constitution or ordained and established by Parliament

CA/HCC/0195/23

5 | P a g e

shall subject to the provisions of the Constitution be held in public,

and all persons shall be entitled freely to attend such sittings.

(2) A judge or presiding officer of any such court, tribunal or other

institution may, in his discretion, whenever he considers it desirable -

(a) in proceedings relating to family relations,

(b) in proceedings relating to sexual matters,

(c) in the interests of national security or public safety, or

(d) in the interests of order and security within the precincts of such

court, tribunal or other institution exclude therefrom such persons as

are not directly interested in the proceedings therein,

Exclude therefrom such persons as are not directly interested in the

proceedings therein.

On the day of the trial, upon the application of the State Counsel the learned

High Court Judge had decided to take up the trial in his chambers. The

Counsel for the Appellant had not expressed any objection to this move.

Although the trial commenced, the prosecution had been unable to conclude

the evidence of the victim as the learned High Court Judge had observed

some abnormality in the behaviour of the victim. Therefore, without any

medical history or medical report the learned High Court Judge postponed

the trial till 23.03.2020. The relevant portion of the proceedings is re-

produced below:

Judicial discretion denotes the authority vested in judges to render decisions

guided by their judgment and sense of justice, provided they act within the

framework of the law. This discretion enables the judiciary to take into

account the particular facts and context of each case, promoting equitable

application of legal principles rather than strict adherence to inflexible rules.

However, such discretion is not absolute; it must be exercised judiciously

and reasonably, and remains subject to appellate oversight to prevent

arbitrary or capricious use.

Considering the circumstances of this particular case, the learned High

Court Judge could have taken the trial in camera rather than in his

chambers.

As the remaining grounds of appeal are interconnected, they will be

considered together hereinafter.

The victim while giving evidence had stated that the Appellant had only

attempted to commit the alleged offence. She did not reveal that any

particular sexual act was in fact committed on her by the Appellant. The

relevant portions are re-produced below:

As the victim has shown reluctance to give evidence, the learned High Court

Judge had adjourned the trial citing that the trial should be delayed for at

least six months time. The trial only resumed after about 11 months of the

initial trial and when it did, the victim had given evidence which was in

conformity with her statement to the police.

As stated above, through part of the evidence-in-chief of the victim, the

learned High Court Judge had observed that the victim was not well and was

possibly suffering from a psychological disorder, however, he had not

collected any medical report to prove the same. While the victim was giving

evidence, her mother, PW2 had been summoned to his chambers as well and

the Judge had inquired from PW2 whether the victim was suffering from any

disorder at that time. After consulting PW2, the learned High Court Judge

had arrived at the conclusion that the trial cannot proceed at least within

the next six months. Postponing the case for such a long period of time

without any plausible reason has caused great prejudice to the Appellant.

According to the victim, her brother had witnessed the Appellant leaving the

room where the alleged offence took place. Further she had stated that her

brother had disclosed the incident to her mother.

PW2, the mother of the victim had endorsed the same when she gave

evidence. The relevant portions are re-produced below:

Considering the portions of evidence referred to above, the brother of the

victim is an eye witness to the incident. But the prosecution has not called

the brother of the victim to give evidence on their behalf.

In a case of this nature, the testimonial trustworthiness and credibility of

PW1, mainly the probability should be assessed with utmost care and

caution by the Trial Judge. The learned Trial Judge has to accept the

evidence of a child witness only after assessing his/her competence and

credibility as a witness.

In Ranjeet Kumar Ram v. State of Bihar [2015] SCC Online SC 500 the

court held that:

Evidence of the child witness and its credibility would depend upon the

circumstances of each case. Only precaution which the court has to bear

in mind while assessing the evidence of a child witness is that the

witness must be a reliable one.

CA/HCC/0195/23

10 | P a g e

Considering the above cited judicial decision, as the credibility of the

evidence of a child witness would depend on the circumstances of each case,

it is the duty of the learned Trial Judge to assess and decide on the evidence

given by child witnesses.

According to the victim, her brother had recounted the incident to her

mother. She had then taken steps to inform the incident to the police.

Therefore, the brother of the victim is an essential witness in this case.

Essential witnesses in a criminal trial are those individuals who possess

crucial firsthand information about the crime, directly linking the defendant

to the alleged crime and whose testimony is considered vital for the

prosecution to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.

In King v. Seneviratne 38 NLR 208 the Court held that:

Witnesses essential to the unfolding of the narrative on which the

prosecution is based must be called by the prosecution, whether in the

result the effect of their testimony is for or against the case for the

prosecution.

Witness evidence can even be acted upon without corroboration where no

inhibition or unreliability has been attached or suggested against such

testimony.

In this case brother of the victim is an essential witness to corroborate the

evidence given by the victim regarding the act of abuse.

His Lordship Justice Dheeraratne in Sunil and others v. Attorney General

[1986] 1 S. L. R 230 held that:

Corroboration is only required or afforded if the witness requiring

corroboration is otherwise credible. If the evidence of witness

requiring corroboration is not credible his testimony should be

rejected and the accused acquitted. Seeking corroboration of a

CA/HCC/0195/23

11 | P a g e

witnesss evidence should not be used as a process of inducing

belief in such evidence where such evidence is not credible.

It is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of a

woman victim of a sex offence but if her evidence is convincing such

evidence could be acted on even the absence of corroboration.

In Premasiri v. Attorney General [2006] 3 Sri.L.R held that:

The rule is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a

conviction in a case of rape but the necessity of corroboration as a

matter of prudence except where the circumstances make it unsafe

to dispense with it, must be present to the mind of the judge.

In State of Andra Pradesh v. Garigula Satya Vani Murty AIR 1997 SC

1588, it was held that:

the courts are expected to show great responsibility while trying an

accused on a charge of rape. They must deal with such cases with

utmost sensitivity.

Considering the evidence given by the victim, her evidence has not been

corroborated by a very important witness, her brother, who had witnessed

an unusual occurrence when he came home after buying cigarettes for the

Appellant. Further, PW2 had confirmed that her son informed her about the

incident. As such the prosecution had failed to satisfy the court that the

evidence given by PW1 has passed the test of consistency, spontaneity and

probability.

In this case PW1 is the key witness. Her evidence is not clear and had not

tallied with material points discussed above. Her evidence is tainted with

ambiguity and uncertainty which definitely affects the root of the case. This

CA/HCC/0195/23

12 | P a g e

has been further aggravated due to the prosecutions failure to call an

essential witness, the brother of the victim.

Taking into consideration all these circumstances, I am of the view that the

conviction of the Appellant cannot be allowed to stand as the prosecution

had failed its duty to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt. I set aside

the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge of

Monaragala dated 11/08/2023 on the Appellant. Therefore, he is acquitted

from this case.

Therefore, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Monaragala along with the original case record.

I agree.
