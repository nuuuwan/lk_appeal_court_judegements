S. U. B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner is a company duly incorporated under the Companies Act, No. 07 of

2007 and is carrying out long-term insurance business (P1 and P1(a)). The 7th

Respondent had made a complaint dated 27.04.2021 marked as P2 to the Petitioner

regarding an Agent of the Petitioner miscommunicating the payment and benefit of an

Insurance Policy. With the participation of the 7th Respondent, the Petitioner

conducted an inquiry against the said Agent on 07.05.2021 and 14.12.2021 and

thereafter, the Petitioner refunded the 7th Respondent the money which the 7th

Respondent had paid for the Insurance Policy (P4). Thereafter, the Petitioner received

a Right to Information Form (RTI Form) from the 7th Respondent dated 30.01.2022

marked as P3 and 26.09.2022 marked as P3(a) requesting the inquiry recordings and

the details of the disciplinary process conducted against the said Agent by the

Petitioner. The Petitioner had not responded to the RTI Form of the 7th Respondent

and had orally communicated its refusal to provide such recordings to the 7th

Respondent.

Thereafter, the Petitioner received the notice dated 07.02.2023 marked as P5 from the

Right to Information Commission, the 1st Respondent, directing the Petitioner to be

present for an inquiry on an appeal (marked as P5(a) to P5(c)) made by the 7th

Respondent. On the day of the said inquiry, the Petitioner raised a preliminary

objection that the 1st Respondent had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal

4

made by the 7th Respondent as the Petitioner is not a public authority under the

Right to Information Act, No. 12 of 2016 (the Act) and therefore the appeal should be

dismissed in limine. The Petitioner submitted written submissions on the said

preliminary objections (marked as P7). Subsequently, the registration of the Petitioner

with the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (P9(b)), the Articles of

Association (P9(e)) and the Memorandum of Association (P9(f)) were also submitted

by the Petitioner on the request of the Director General of the 1st Respondent (P9 and

P9(c)). The preliminary objection raised by the Petitioner was overruled at the hearing

held on 30.05.2024 (P10), and the Petitioner received the determination of the 1st

Respondent dated 30.05.2024 marked as P12.

Being aggrieved by the said determination marked as P12, the Petitioner made this

Writ Application seeking the following substantive reliefs, inter alia,

b. For the grant and issuance of an order in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari

quashing the purported Determination (P12);

c. For the grant and issuance of an order in the nature of Writ of Prohibition,

prohibiting and/or preventing the 1st and/or 2nd and/or 3rd and/or 4th and/or 5th

Respondents and/or their servants and/ or agents and/ or whomsoever acting

under their directions from taking any step whatsoever against the Petitioner

under the Right to Information Act No. 12 of 2016;

5

d. For the grant and issuance of an order in the nature of Writ of Prohibition,

prohibiting and/or preventing the 1st and/or 2nd and/or 3rd and/or 4th and/or

5thRespondents and/ or their servants and/ or agents and/ or whomsoever

acting under their directions from proceedings with the purported inquiry No.

RTIC/Appeal/1273/2022;

e. For an Order dismissing the purported inquiry No. RTIC/Appeal/1273/2022

before the 1st Respondent;

When this matter was taken up for argument, the learned Presidents Counsel

appearing for the Petitioner made oral submissions, and the learned Counsel

appearing for the 1st to 6th Respondents did not make oral submissions, but reserved

rights to file written submissions. Accordingly, the written submissions have been

filed on 01.07.2025. In response to those written submissions, the Petitioner has

submitted written submissions on 23.07.2025. This Court now will consider the

arguments put forward by both parties to this Application.

The learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argues that the Petitioner

is not a public authority under Section 43 of the Act and the inquiry conducted

against the insurance Agent is of private law and the 1st to 6th Respondents lacks

jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal made against the Petitioner, therefore,

the determination marked as P12 is, arbitrary, unreasonable, ultra vires and contains

error of law on the face of record.

6

First, I will examine the provisions of the Act relevant to this Application. In terms of

Section 3(1) of the Act, subject to the limitations set out in Section 5, every citizen

has a right of access to information which is in the possession, custody or control of a

public authority. In terms of Section 24 of the Act, any citizen who wishes to obtain

information under this Act can make a request to the appropriate information officer,

specifying the particulars of the information requested. Under Section 31(1)(a), any

citizen who is aggrieved as a result of refusing a request made for information can

prefer an appeal to the designated officer within fourteen days of the refusal. In terms

of Section 31(3), the designated officer shall decide on any appeal preferred under

Section 31(1) within three weeks of the receipt of the appeal. If a citizen aggrieved by

a decision made under Section 31(1) of the Act or if failed to obtain a decision within

the period specified under Section 31(3) of the Act,they can prefer an appeal to the

Commission (the 1st Respondent) under Section 32 of the Act.It is evident from the

provisions of the Act that information can only be requested from a public authority.

Section 43 of the Act defines the term public authority. The question before this

Court is to determine whether the Petitioner falls within the definition of a public

authority under Section 43 of the Act. In the order marked as P12, the 1st Respondent

has come to the conclusion that the Petitioner is a public authorityin terms of

Section 43(g) of the Act. Section 43(g) of the Act reads thus,

a private entity or organisation which is carrying out a statutory or public

function or service, under a contract, a partnership, an agreement or a

7

license from the government or its agencies or from a local body, but only to

the extent of activities covered by that statutory or public function or

service.

The 1st Respondent arrived at the above conclusion in the order marked as P12 in the

following manner.

The Respondents argument regarding the Petitioners claim is that, in terms of

Section 12 of the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act, No. 43 of 2000 (as amended)

(Insurance Industry Act), unless registered, no person can engage in insurance

business in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the Petitioner has obtained a valid license issued

by the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka under the Insurance Industry

9

Act. Therefore, the Petitioner is a private entity licensed by the Government under

Section 43(g) of the Act. The Respondents further argue that the Petitioner performs a

statutory function as the Insurance Industry Act prohibits carrying out insurance

business without a valid license, and non-compliance with such provisions follows

severe punishments, and therefore, insurance companies perform a statutory function

by operating within a framework designed to ensure accountability to the public and

the regulatory body.

Upon considering the arguments advanced by the Respondents and the order marked

as P12, it appears that the Respondents have concluded that, in terms of Section 43(g)

of the Act, private entities engaged in a statutory or public function or service

pursuant to a contract, partnership, agreement, or license with the Government, its

Agents, or local authorities fall within the definition of a public authority. However,

upon a careful examination of Section 43(g) of the Act, this Court observes that the

Respondents have failed to take into account a material portion of the said provision

in arriving at the aforesaid conclusion. Even though Section 43(g) states that a private

entity licensed from the Government which carrying out a statutory or public function

or service is considered a public authority under the Act, the latter part of the section

emphasises the fact that it relates only to the extent of activities covered by that

statutory or public function or service. Thus, under Section 43(g) of the Act, a

private entity may be regarded as a public authority only to the extent of the

10

activities connected to the specific statutory or public function or service licensed or

authorised by the Government.

In the instant Application, the Petitioner has obtained a license from the Insurance

Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka under the Insurance Industry Act to carry out

long-term insurance business (P1(a)). However, the 1st Respondent has erred in

coming to the conclusion that the Petitioner is a public authority under the Act, as it

has failed to take into consideration the nature of the information requested by the 7th

Respondent. The 7th Respondent has requested the inquiry recordings and details of

the disciplinary inquiry, along with the actions taken by the Petitioner against its

Agent (P3 and P3(a)). Under Section 43(g) of the Act, the Petitioner can be regarded

as a public authority only to the extent that it is engaged in carrying out functions

regulated by the provisions of the Insurance Industry Act in relation to the conduct of

insurance business. The Insurance Industry Act does not contain any provision

relating to the conduct of internal disciplinary inquiries concerning persons or Agents

of such persons engaged in the business of insurance. Therefore, considering the fact

that the information requested by the 7th Respondent are internal disciplinary inquiry

proceedings of the Petitioner not governed under the Insurance Industry Act, this

Court is of the view that there is an error of law on the face of record as the 1st

Respondent has acted without jurisdiction in deciding to continue the inquiry by

coming into the conclusion that the Petitioner is a public authority under Section

43(g) of the Act.

11

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J., in the case of Hijra Farms (Pvt) Ltd. v. Commissioner

General of Labour,1 held that,

Error of law on the face of the record is a ground for certiorari.

If the tribunal had no jurisdiction to inquire into the matter, there is no issue

that the decision taken is a nullity. On the other hand, even if the tribunal had

jurisdiction to inquire into the matter, the decision can still become a nullity if

inter alia (a) it has identified a wrong issue as the correct issue to be answered

or (b) having initially identified the correct issue, ultimately, albeit bona fide,

answered a wrong issue as the correct issue.

In Gunasekera v. De Mel, Commissioner of Labour2, the Supreme Court held that,

Lack of jurisdiction may arise in different ways. While engaged on a proper

inquiry the tribunal may depart from the rules of natural justice or it may ask

itself the wrong questions or may take into account matters which it was not

directed to take into account. Thereby it would step outside its jurisdiction. A

tribunal which has made findings of fact wholly unsupported by evidence or

which it has drawn inferences wholly unsupported by any of the facts found by

it will be held to have erred in point of law. The concept of error of law

includes the giving of reasons that are bad in law or inconsistent,

1 CA/WRIT/292/2014, CA Minutes of 20.05.2020

2(1978) 79(2) NLR 409

12

unintelligible or it would seem substantially inadequate. It includes also the

application of a wrong legal test to the facts found taking irrelevant

considerations into account and arriving at a conclusion without any

supporting evidence. If reasons are given and these disclose that an erroneous

legal approach has been followed the superior Court can set the decision

aside by certiorari for error of law on the face of the record. If the grounds or

reasons stated disclose a clearly erroneous legal approach the decision will

be quashed. An error of law may also be held to be apparent on the face of the

record if the inferences and decisions reached by the tribunal in any given

case are such as no reasonable body of persons properly instructed in the law

applicable to the case could have made. (emphasis added)

It was held in the case of Anisminic Ltd v. Foreign Compensation3that, the error

destroyed the jurisdiction of the Commission and made its decision Ultra Vires

Considering the above-stated facts and authorities, this Court is of the view that the 1st

Respondent has acted outside its jurisdiction and therefore the order marked as P12 is

ultra vires. Therefore, this Court is inclined to grant relief prayed for in the prayer (b)

to issue a Writ of certiorari to quash P12.

Dr. Sunil Cooray's book on Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka (Vol. 2,

4thedn)4 states thus,

3Commission (1968) APP. L.R. 12/17

13

The circumstances in which certiorari and prohibition will be available have

been summed up by Lord Justice Atkin, an English judge, in the following

famous words which on numerous occasions have been cited and followed by

our Courts:

Whenever any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions

affecting the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act judicially, act in

excess of their legal authority they are subject to the controlling jurisdiction of

the Kings Bench Division exercised in these Writs. [R v. Electricity

Commissioners (1924) 1 KB 171]

In Administrative Law, by H. W. R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth (11thedn),5 it has been

stated that,

Although a prohibiting Order was originally used to prevent tribunals from

meddling with cases over which they had no jurisdiction, it was equally

effective, and equally often used, to prohibit the execution of some decision

already taken but ultra vires. So long as the tribunal or administrative

authority still had some power to exercise as a consequence of the wrongful

decision, the exercise of that power could be restrained by a prohibiting

Order.

This Court is of the view that, having considered the aforementioned authorities and

the fact that the 1st Respondent acted without jurisdiction in concluding that the

Petitioner falls within the definition of a public authority under Section 43(g) of the

Act, it is inclined to grant the Writs of Prohibition as prayed for in prayers (c) and (d)

of the Petition in the instant Application.

The learned Counsel appearing for the 1st to 6th Respondents further argues that the

Petitioner is not entitled to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court, as the Petitioner

has an alternative remedy by way of an appeal under Section 34 of the Act to make an

appeal to this Court. In terms of Section 34 of the Act, a citizen or a public authority

aggrieved by a decision made by the 1st Respondent under Section 32 of the Act can

appeal against such a decision to this Court. The 1st to 6th Respondents argument is

that a statutory remedy is available to the Petitioner, and therefore, this is not a fit case

to exercise the discretionary remedy of this Court. This Court agrees with the fact that

when there is an effective alternative remedy available, writ courts are reluctant to

exercise its jurisdiction. However, it is the view of this Court that whether the

Petitioner should resort to such an alternative remedy available to him depends on the

facts and circumstances of each case. Considering the nature of the information

requested, this Court has already held that the Petitioner does not fall within the

definition of a 'public authority' under Section 43(g) of the Act. Accordingly, the 1st

Respondent has acted without jurisdiction in determining that the Petitioner is a public

authority. Therefore, the availability of an alternative remedy does not prevent this

15

Court from exercising its writ jurisdiction. In the case of Sirisena v. Kotawara

Udagama Corporative Society Ltd,6which was an application for a writ of Certiorari

to quash an award of an arbitrator, Gratien, J. issued a writ of Certiorari to quash the

award made by the Respondents who have flagrantly exceeded the limited statutory

powers conferred on them. Gratien J. also observed that,

It is no doubt a well-recognized principle of law that the Supreme Court will

not as a rule make an order of Mandamus or Certiorari where there is an

alternative and equally convenient remedy available to the aggrieved party.

But the rule is not a rigid one.

In Kanagarathna v. Rajasundaram,7 Samarakoon, C.J.,referring to the above case,

held that, The availability of an alternative remedy does not prevent a Court from

issuing a Writ of Prohibition in cases of excess or absence of jurisdiction.

Referring to the above two cases, in the case of Sinha Cement (Pvt) Ltd v. Director

Central Investigation Bureau Sri Lanka,8 C. P. Kirtisinghe, J.also held that, In any

event, the availability of an alternative remedy does not prevent this court from

issuing a Writ in a case of excess or absence of jurisdiction.

Having considered the above authorities and the fact that the 1st Respondent has acted

without jurisdiction, this Court is of the view that the availability of an appeal under

Section 34 of the Act does not preclude the exercise of this Courts writ jurisdiction.

Under the above-stated circumstances, this Court is of the view that the order made by

the 1st Respondent marked as P12 is issued without jurisdiction as it contains an error

of law on the face of the record and therefore is ultra vires. Accordingly, this Court

grants relief prayed for in prayers (b), (c), (d) and (e) of the Petition. Application

allowed. No costs ordered.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Dr. D. F. H. Gunawardhana, J.

I agree with my brother, Justice S.U.B. Karalliyadde, on the factual matrix, and also

particularly on his final conclusion. However, I wish to deal with certain matters in

my separate judgement, for different reasons, which I will set out below. It is my view

too that the Petitioner is entitled to the relief sought which is granted by my brother,

Justice S.U.B. Karalliyadde. Therefore, I confess, that I refrain from referring to the

same facts adverted by Justice S.U.B. Karalliyadde to avoid repetition.

17

Background

The Petitioner is a body corporate incorporated under the Companies Act, No. 7 of

2007. It has the license to carry on its business of life insurance only (as described

as Long-Term Insurance Business) under the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act,

No. 43 of 2000 (as amended). The 1st Respondent is the Right to Information

Commission (herein after referred to as the RTIC) created by the Right to

Information Act, No. 12 of 2016 (herein after referred to as the Right to Information

Act). The 2nd Respondent is the chairman of the RTIC, whilst the 3rd to 6th

Respondents are Commissioners of the 1st Respondent. It is further alleged that 2nd to

5th Respondents are signatories to the impugned order dated 30th May 2024 annexed

to the Petition marked as P12 (herein after referred P12 or impugned order). The 7th

Respondent is an individual who has lodged an appeal with the 1st Respondent, in

terms of the RTIC seeking certain information from the Petitioner. This has arisen in

the following way.

The Petitioner had received a certain sum of money amounting to Rs. 4,001,580/-

(four million one thousand five hundred and eighty rupees) as premia from the 7th

Respondent to obtain a certain policy of insurance. The Petitioner had so received the

said sum, in the process of issuing a life insurance policy applied (proposed) by the 7th

Respondent, through an Agent. The 7th Respondent, pending the issuance of the

policy, made a complaint against the said Agent of the Petitioner. The Petitioner had

18

inquired into the complaint; and consequently, decided to refund the said amount to

the 7th Respondent which the Petitioner asserts that the inquiry against the Agent was

conducted only as an internal inquiry to clear its name and to maintain a good name in

the industry.

Subsequent to refunding of the said sum, the 7th Respondent, had initiated

proceedings under the Right to Information Act, No. 12 of 2016, and noticed the

Petitioner, which the Petitioner had ignored. Thereafter, the 7th Respondent made an

appeal to the 1st Respondent, the Right to Information Commission, to ascertain the

particulars of the inquiry held by the Petitioner as an internal inquiry against its Agent

on the complaint made by the 7th Respondent. Consequently, the 1st Respondent upon

noticing the Petitioner to appear before it embarked on an inquiry. At the said inquiry,

the Petitioner was represented by an Attorney-at-Law.

At the very outset of the inquiry, a preliminary objection was raised as to the

maintainability of the appeal lodged by the 7th Respondent on the basis that the

Petitioner is neither a part of the Government nor a public company nor is it engaged

in any business with the Government. After hearing the preliminary objections

followed by the written submissions filed by the parties, the 2nd to 6th Respondents by

the impugned order dated 30.05.2024 have rejected the preliminary objections and

directed to inquire further into the appeal lodged by the 7th Respondent. The said

order is marked as P12, annexed to the Petition.

19

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Petitioner has sought to obtain a Writ of

Certiorari to quash the order contained in P12. This was argued on 7th of July 2025

before us; hence this judgment.

The Respondents have filed their formal objections. It is the position of the

Respondents that, since the Petitioner is engaged in a business regulated by a statute,

the Petitioner cannot deny that there is any public element involved in its business. In

addition to that, they relied heavily on Section 43(g) of Right to Information Act to

bring public element into the Petitioner. As such, they sought the dismissal of this

application.

At the hearing, Mr. Nigel Hatch, Learned President Counsel for the Petitioner argued

that the Petitioner is challenging the impugned order of the Right to Information

Commission on several grounds. Firstly, P12 has been made without any jurisdiction

as far as the Petitioner is concerned. Therefore, there is a patent lack of jurisdiction

in the RTIC when it made the decision contained in P12 (the impugned order).

Further elucidating the same argument, Mr. Hatch P.C. contended that the Petitioner

being a private limited company, does not fall within Section 43 of the Right to

Information Act No. 12 of 2016, therefore, the RTIC does not have any authority to

compel the Petitioner to submit any information on the basis that it is a public

corporation. Therefore, Mr. Hatch P.C. contended that P12 is ultra vires.

20

In addition to that, he argued that the Chief Legal Officer of the Petitioner attended

every day of the proceedings. On one of those proceedings, the 3rd Respondent

indicated orally that the Petitioners business falls within the ambit of a public

corporation since a public element is involved; whereby the 3rd Respondent had made

an attempt to expand the authority of the Commission. Therefore, the decision made

by the RTIC as indicated by the 3rd Respondent is capricious, as established in P10,

that was made prior to P12; though P10 had not provided any reasoning as the

maintainability of the appeal by the 7th Respondent.

Mr. Hatch P.C. further contended that, as reflected in P12, the RTIC has given a

strained interpretation which does not fall into any concepts of business of insurance

available in textbooks. Mr. Hatch P.C. further contended that the Petitioner is a

private entity which is only engaged in life insurance policy after the segregation of

insurance businesses; therefore, it does not underwrite or undertake general insurance.

Therefore, Sections 99 read with 100 and 105 of the Motor Traffic Act, No. 14 of

1951 (as amended) do not apply to contracts entered into by the Petitioner and its

customers.

On the application of the Counsel for the Respondents, permission was given to

advance her argument by way of a written submission. In her written submission,

argument advanced by Ms. Dilumi de Alwis is of two folds: One, as a matter of

preliminary issue.

21

Ms. Dilumi de Alwis argues that the Petitioner is not entitled to obtain any relief as

sought, since he has failed to exercise right of appeal against any order or decision

made by the Right to Information Commission.

Secondly, she argued that, since the business engaged by the Petitioner involves a

public element, it is not entitled to refuse any information to disclose as decided by

the Right to Information Commission. She heavily relies on Section 43(g) of the Right

to Information Act. In addition to that, she further argues that the Petitioner is

subjected to be regulated under the provisions of the Regulation of Insurance Industry

Act, and the Companies Act, therefore, the Petitioner is bound by the statute to

divulge all information. As such, it is not entitled to obtain writs in the nature of Writs

of Certiorari or Prohibition.

Historical evolution and statutory law of insurance

To understand the present status of the law relating to the insurance industry in Sri

Lanka, I am of the view that the short history of the evolution of statutory law that

governs the law of insurance should be dealt with before giving an interpretation to

the relevant statute.

By 1960, there had been so many mushroom-insurance companies operating in Sri

Lanka engaged in general and life insurance. Nevertheless, the Government elected

by the 1960 election (August election) decided to nationalise the insurance industry

by introducing the Control of Insurance Act No. 25 of 1962; thereby, establishing the

22

Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation; in which the monopoly was created. Thereafter, no

company or individual was permitted to engage in the business of insurance in Sri

Lanka until the 1979 Act was enacted9, in terms of which the National Insurance

Corporation was established.

However, in 1987 the insurance industry was privatised and the two corporations

owned by the Government, namely the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation and the

National Insurance Corporation, (both) were privatised by converting them into public

companies and selling their shares in the share market10.

However, for the purpose of regulating the insurance industry the Regulation of

Insurance Industry Act, No. 43 of 2000 was introduced by the Government of the day,

having repealed the Control of Insurance Act, No. 25 of 1962, introduced the

Regulation of Insurance Act, No. 43 of 2000. However, in 2011 the insurance

industry was further regulated.

Therefore, the business of the insurance industry was segregated in 2011 by an Act of

Parliament; whereby, it is required that insurers who are engaged in the business of

general and life insurance after the promulgation of the Regulation of Insurance

Industry (Amendment) Act, No. 3 of 2011 to segregate their business. Therefore, they

can alternatively have the business of either general insurance or life insurance only,

9 National Insurance Corporation Act, No. 1 of 1978

10 Conversion of Public Corporations or Government Owned Business Undertaking Into Public

Companies Act, No. 23 of 1987

23

but not both. Thus, those who are engaged in life insurance cannot be engaged in

general insurance.

Therefore, after the promulgation of the Regulation of Insurance Industry

(Amendment) Act, No. 3 of 2011, the business was thus segregated. As the Petitioner

asserts it is only engaged in the business of life insurance and not in general

insurance. Therefore, it only issues life insurance policies and undertakes and

underwrites life insurance and related matters, not any general insurance. As such, it

is not permitted to engage itself in any general insurance business, including the

insurance required to be insured under the Motor Traffic Act, No. 14 of 1951 (herein

after referred to as the Motor Traffic Act). As such, the mandatory insurance

required by Section 100 read with Section 105 of the Motor Traffic Act does not

come within the purview of the business engaged by the Petitioner. As such, it can be

said that the Petitioners business of insurance is only limited to a certain private

contract which is governed by the law of insurance in addition to the law of contracts.

Contract of Life Insurance

As far as life insurance policies are concerned, the parties relevant to the business is

only the insurer and the insured. Life insurance can be distinguished from other

contracts of insurance: One such is that, without any insurable interest, nobody is

entitled to enter into a life insurance policy. The other feature is that life insurance is a

24

long-term insurance; whereas other insurance policies are for a limited period or

based on certain contingencies that is expected to take place. Nevertheless, the benefit

of the life insurance policy can be claimed by the very person whose life is insured

after the maturity; hence, it is called a long-term policy as well11.

However, in between when an insurance policy is proposed, there can be an

intermediary or an agent or a broker. There are ancillary contracts between the Agent

and the customer or the proposed insurer and the proposed insured. In this case, there

is no insurance policy issued. The premia paid by the 7th Respondent had already been

refunded after the domestic inquiry12, due to the misconduct or misrepresentation by

the Agent who introduced the 7th Respondent to the Petitioner. Therefore, that

relevancy of such an insurance does not arise here. The only question pertinent to this

application is whether the purview of the authority of the 1st Respondent can be

extended to private contracts. As I mentioned above, no element of public body, or

public element (any government element) is involved in this matter. Therefore, the 2nd

to 5th Respondents have totally misdirected themselves in holding that there is a

public element involved, since by law the insurance required under the Motor Traffic

Act No. 14 of 1951 is only relevant to third party insurance and motor traffic policies.

Since, the 7th Respondent is a private individual, who proposed to obtain a life

insurance policy, it is totally different from motor traffic insurance. As such, it is my

view that a Writ of Certiorari lies since the decision is ultra vires and against the

statutory provisions and also obnoxious to the law of contract of insurance as well.

The 2nd to 6th Respondents erred

It is decided on behalf of the 1st Respondent by P12 that the Petitioner is engaged in

the business of insurance, and by law, it is required to issue insurance in terms of the

Motor Traffic Act (as amended) as well. It is also mentioned in the said order that the

Motor Traffic Act mandatorily requires to insure motor vehicles when a motor vehicle

is put on the road as, at anytime, and anywhere an accident can take place which

might damage life or result in bodily injury of individuals. Therefore, there is a

mandatory requirement by the Motor Traffic Act for any person, or user, or an owner

of a motor vehicle to have insured it before putting it onto the road, at least covering

the third party.

However, it must also be mentioned that such an insurance policy can only be issued

now (after the Regulation of Insurance Industry (Amendment) Act, No. 3 of 2011)

only by an insurance company or insurer who is engaged in general insurance and

not engaged in life insurance. Therefore, as decided by the 2nd to 5th Respondents on

behalf of the 1st Respondent, the RTIC, the very basis on which a public element is

involved in the insurance business engaged by the Petitioner does not fall within the

public element of any requirement under the Motor Traffic Act. As such they have

totally misinterpreted the particular provisions of the Motor Traffic Act as well as the

26

insurance business engaged by the Petitioner. In addition to that, they have not

appreciated or rather have lost sight of the provisions of the Regulation of Insurance

Industry (Amendment) Act, No. 3 of 2011. As such the decision contained in P12 is

palpably wrong and cannot stand in the eyes of the law of the land. Therefore, the

preliminary objections raised by the Petitioner on notice of the Respondents to appear

to inquire into the appeal should have been considered in light of the statutory

provisions provided in the Regulation of Insurance Industry (Amendment) Act, No. 3

of 2011, in addition to the principles relevant to the life insurance policies which the

several Respondents have failed to do.

Preliminary objection

It has been argued for and on behalf of the Respondents by way of a written

submission, as a preliminary matter, that this Court should not grant a Writ of

Certiorari as a discretionary remedy on the complaint made by the Petitioner to this

Court, on the basis that there is a right of appeal available to a party or a public

corporation aggrieved by any decision made by the Right to Information Commission.

However, suffice it to say, as I have mentioned above, the first matter that must be

borne in mind is whether the Right to Information Commission lacks jurisdiction to

make findings or arrive at any decisions. The lack of jurisdiction may be of

twofold: one is patent lack of jurisdiction, and the other is latent lack of

jurisdiction. Patent lack of jurisdiction arises when there is an apparent absence of

27

jurisdiction on the face of the record, and the Court, Tribunal, or statutory body

exercising quasi-judicial powers cannot proceed with the matter. Latent lack of

jurisdiction, of course, is a hidden issue that can only be determined after certain

evidence is presented. This aspect of the law is extensively dealt with in the two

landmark judgements, P. Beatrice Perera v National Housing Commission13 and S.

Henrietta Fernando v W. Robinson Fernando14.

Having consulted relevant authorities, His Lordship Samerawickrame, J in S.

Henrietta Fernando v Robinson Fernando (supra), deduced the following formula;

Where the want of jurisdiction is patent, objection to jurisdiction may be taken at

any time. In such a case it is in fact the duty of the Court itself ex meromolu to

raise the point even if the parties fail to do so. In Farquharson v. Morgan?

Halsbury L.C. said, "It has long since been held that where the objection to the

jurisdiction of an inferior court appears upon the face of the record it is

immaterial how the matter is brought before the Superior Court, for the Superior

Court must interfere to protect the prerogative of the Crown by prohibiting the

inferior court from exceeding its jurisdiction. That is to say, where the want of

jurisdiction appears upon the libel, as in an ecclesiastical court, or upon the face

of the record, and does not depend upon a mere matter of fact, and a cause is

13 [1974] 77 NLR 361

14 [1971] 74 NLR 57

28

entertained by an inferior court which is clearly beyond its jurisdiction, no

consent of parties will justify the Superior Court in refusing a prohibition. "

In the same case, Lopes L.J. said, "The reason why, notwithstanding such

acquiescence, a prohibition is granted where the want of jurisdiction is apparent

on the face of the proceedings is explained by Lord Denman (G N. & M. 176) to

be for the sake of the public, because 'the case might be a precedent if allowed to

stand without impeachment' and I would add for myself, because it is a want of

jurisdiction which the court is informed by the proceedings before it, and which

the judge should have observed, and a point which he should himself have taken."

The position however appears to be different where the want of jurisdiction is not

apparent on the face of the record but depends upon the proof of facts. In such a

case, it is for a party who asserts that the Court has no jurisdiction to raise the

matter and prove the necessary facts. A Court has to proceed upon the facts

placed before it and its jurisdiction must therefore depend upon them and not

upon the facts that may actually exist.15

With the same vigour, a few years later, Tennekoon, C.J in Perera v National

Housing Commission also faced with a similar situation deduced as follows.

Lack of competency in a Court is a circumstance that results in a judgment or

order that is void. Lack of competency may arise in one of two ways. A Court

15 [1971] 74 NLR 58

29

may lack jurisdiction over the cause or matter or over the parties; it may also

lack competence because of failure to comply with such procedural

requirements as are necessary for the exercise of power by the Court. Both are

jurisdictional defects; the first mentioned of these is commonly known in the

law as a 'patent' or 'total' want of jurisdiction or a defectusjurisdictionis and

the second a 'latent' or contingent ' want of jurisdiction or a defectustriationis.

Both classes of jurisdictional defect result in judgments or orders which are

void. But an important difference must also be noted. In that class of case

where the want of jurisdiction is patent, no waiver of objection or

acquiescence can cure the want of jurisdiction; the reason for this being that to

permit parties by their conduct to confer jurisdiction on a tribunal which has

none would be to admit a power in the parties to litigation to create new

jurisdictions or to extend a jurisdiction beyond its existing limits, both of which

are within the exclusive privilege of the legislature; the proceedings in cases

within this category are non coram judice and the want of jurisdiction is

incurable. In the other class of case, where the want of jurisdiction is

contingent only, the judgment or order of the Court will be void only against

the party on whom it operates but acquiescence, waiver or inaction on the part

of such person may stop him from making or attempting to establish by

evidence, any averment to the effect that the Court was lacking in contingent

jurisdiction. This distinction is brought out in certain passage which I quote

30

from Shortt on Mandamus (1887) and Spencer Bower on Estoppel by

Representation.16

Accordingly, the jurisdictional issue can be taken up anytime. Therefore, it is my view

in this case that, since the Petitioners business does not fall into the category of a

public corporation, it also does not have any element of public law which attracts the

scope of Section 43 of the Right to Information Act. This is due to the nature of the

contracts that the Petitioner is permitted to engage in, in terms of Section 12 of the

Regulation of Insurance Industry Act (as amended), which only allows the Petitioner

to enter into life insurance contracts (described as Long Term Insurance Business),

not general insurance contracts, under which third-party insurance is a necessary

element. The Petitioner is not permitted to engage in any third-party insurance in that

sense, which attracts the Motor Traffic Act. Therefore, it is very clear that no public

element is involved in the business. As such, the 1st Respondent patently lacks

jurisdiction, and the decision taken by the 2nd to 6th Respondents is erroneous on the

face of the record.

Application of the Right to Information Act

The Right to Information Act was promulgated in 2016 as an election pledge by the

then popularly known as Government for Good Governance, elected in 2015. The

Preamble of the Act deals with as to how and why it is promulgated; thus,

16 [1974] 77 NLR 366

31

WHEREAS the Constitution guarantees the right of access to information in

Article 14A thereof and there exists a need to foster a culture of transparency

and accountability in public authorities by giving effect to the right of access to

information and thereby promote a society in which the people of Sri Lanka

would be able to more fully participate in public life through combating

corruption and promoting accountability and good governance.

In addition to that, although certain information is liable to be disclosed under the

Right to Information Act; on the other hand, certain information need not be disclosed

due to various reasons. One such information is inter alia dealt with as follows,

Section 5

(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (2) a request under this Act for access

to information shall be refused, where-...

(g) the information is required to be kept confidential by reason of the

existence of a fiduciary relationship;

The information liable to be disclosed under the RTI is also dealt with, and such

information only relates to a certain public authority or is germane to a public element

only. Therefore, it is pertinent to address what the public element is; which is dealt

in the Interpretation Section of the Act. As argued by the learned Counsel for the

Respondents in her written submissions, the relevant part of the Act is Section 43(g),

which for clarity I will reproduce the same.

32

(g) a private entity or organisation which is carrying out a statutory or public

function or service, under a contract, a partnership, an agreement or a license

from the government or its agencies or from a local body, but only to the extent

of activities covered by that statutory or public function or service;

However, as I have mentioned above, the 1st to 6th Respondents though entertained the

7th Respondent appealed under the Right to Information Act, the public element of the

Petitioner company involved in the said provision of Section 43(g) of the Act is not

established. Therefore, such information by the Petitioner is not liable to be disclosed

in terms of Section 5 of the Act. Accordingly, there is a clear lack of jurisdiction for

the 1st to 6th Respondents to entertain the appeal by the 7th Respondent. As such, for

the reasons adumbrated by me in my separate judgement, I agree with my senior

brother, Justice S. U. B. Karalliyadde, with the conclusion that he has arrived at, but

for different reasons.
