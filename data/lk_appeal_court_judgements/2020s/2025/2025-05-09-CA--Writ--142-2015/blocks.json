The Petitioner further requested that he be not considered as a candidate for the above MD (Family Medicine) Examination to be held in February 2015, and requested that he be permitted to sit for the subsequent examination, considering the same as his first attempt. Thereafter, the Petitioner had applied to sit for the MD (Family Medicine) Examination scheduled for April 2015. The 4th Respondent by his letter dated 18.03.2015 (P40) had informed the Petitioner that the Board of Management of the PGIM has decided that as the Petitioner did not sit for the special examination for MD (Family Medicine) held in February 2015, the examination he will be sitting in April will be considered as his second attempt and that he is required to sit for all components of the examination. The Petitioner moves that the said letter marked P40 be quashed.",
