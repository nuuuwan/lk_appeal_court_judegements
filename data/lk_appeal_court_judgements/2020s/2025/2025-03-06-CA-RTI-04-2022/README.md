JUDGMENT

M.C.B.S. Morais J.

This is a matter of an application made under and in terms of section 34 of the Right to

Information Act No. 12 of 2016 read together with Article 136 of the Constitution of

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (ICASL) (herein after sometimes will be

referred as the Petitioner) seeks to set aside the decision made by the Right to Information

(RTI) Commission of Sri Lanka (hereinafter will be referred as the 2nd Respondent) dated 9th

of February 2022 in the Appeal Inquiry RTI/Appeal/600/2021. Accordingly, the Petitioner

has prayed for the following,

I. Issue notice of the above-styled Application on the 1st to 7th Respondents

above-named;

II. Exercise the Revisionary powers vested in Your Lordship's Court and set aside the

said Decision made by the 2nd Respondent and/or the 3rd to 6th Respondents,

III. Grant an Interim Order staying the operation of the said Decision made by the

Respondent and/or the 3rd to 6th Respondents pending the hearing and/or

determination of the above-styled Application:

IV. Grant an Interim Order retraining the 2nd Respondent and/or the 3rd to 6th

Respondents from taking any steps under Section 39 of the Right to Information Act

pursuant to the said Decision, pending the hearing and/or determination of the above-

styled Application;

V. Direct the 2nd Respondent to produce the entire case record/file pertaining to the

Appeal bearing No. RTIC/Appeal/600/2021;

VI. Grant costs; and

VII. Grant such other and further relief as to Your Lordships Court may seem meet.

Mr. Lionel Dissanayake (hereinafter sometimes will be referred as the 1st Respondent) is a

member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (ICASL). The 1st Respondent

had made a request seeking information under section 24(1) of the RTI Act No.12 of 2016,

from the Petitioner by the email dated 16th of January 2020. The information sought was

related to a complaint received by the Ethics Committee of the Petitioner alleging Fraud and

misappropriation of Rs.20.7 million occurred in the Petitioner Institution. This was

supposedly reported on page 41 of the Abacus Magazine published by ICASL. Accordingly,

the 1st Respondent has requested for the following Information.

1. The name of the institute concerned

2. The Name of the person who had lodged the complaint

3. The Names of the Ethics Committee members who have arrived at this decision.

4. Has the Council followed (Sec. 17) rules as to the inquiries by disciplinary

Committees.

The Information Officer of the Petitioner has acknowledged the request for the information

by the letter dated 23rd of January, and rejected the request for information by letter dated 6th

of February 2020, on the ground that the information sought are personal information

which falls within the scope of section 5(1)(a) of the RTI Act. Thereafter, on the 10th of

February 2020, the 1st Respondent appealed to the Designated Officer of the Petitioner

Institution in terms of section 31 of the Right to Information Act. However, it is the 1st

Respondents contention that no valid response was received. Therefore, the 1st Respondent

has made an appeal in terms of section 32 of the RTI Act to the 2nd Respondent on the 2nd of

April 2020. The Designated Officer of the Petitioner Institution by the email dated 15th of

April 2020 has released the Information to the 1st Respondent regarding the items (1) and (4)

of the requested items, but has refused to provide information for items (2) and (3) on the

same ground of personal information which falls within the scope of section 5(1)(a) of the

Right to Information Act.

The Appeal bearing No. RTIC/Appeal/600/2021 was heard by the 2nd Respondent and the

decision was entered by 3rd - 6th Respondents on 9th of February 2022 in terms of Right to

Information Act No. 12 of 2016. The decision entered, contains the following important

aspects.

Page 5 of 9

1. the PA has failed to adhere to the mandatory timelines laid down for responses

of the PA in relation to information requests as contained in Sections 31 (2) and

31 (3) of the Right to Information Act No. 12 of 2016

2. It is evident to the Commission that there is no impediment to releasing the

information.

Accordingly, the Petitioner was directed to release the information requested by the 1st

Respondent within two weeks from the receipt of the decision. Being aggrieved by the

decision dated 9th of February 2022, the Petitioner has made an application by way of

revision under section 34 of the RTI Act. The Petitioner contends that the request for

information is not genuine as the information sought was information already known to the

1st Respondent, as he is one of the signatories to the complaint made on 6th of June 2019

regarding the financial fraud within ICASL. Further, the Petitioner claims that a fair hearing

was not provided.

However, it is the contention of the 1st Respondent that the Petitioner has committed an

offence under section 39(e) of the Right to Information Act by not adhering to the order of

the Right to Information Commission as the information sought by the 1st Respondent has not

been disclosed to date.

The section 32 of the Right to Information Act reads as follows;

(1) Any citizen aggrieved by:

(a) the decision made in respect of an appeal under section 31(1), may within two

months of the communication of such decision; or

(b) the failure to obtain a decision on any appeal made within the time specified for

giving the same under section 31(3), may within two months of the expiry of the

period so specified,

may appeal against that decision or the failure, to the Commission and the

Commission may within thirty days of the receipt of such appeal affirm, vary or

reverse the decision appealed against and forward the request back to the information

officer concerned for necessary action.

According to section 32 of the RTI Act, any decision made in respect of an appeal under

section 31 of the Act shall be appealed to the commission within two months of such decision

being communicated to the Party. In respect of the appeal, the commission within 30 days of

such appeal may decide on it. It is the Petitioners view that the appeal made by the 1st

Respondent to the commission was made on the 2nd of April 2020, however, the decision was

delivered by the commission on the 9th of February 2022, which is more than a year later.

Therefore, the Petitioner contends that the decisions made were not in line with the

provisions of law.

In Sri Lanka General Workers Union V. Samaranayake [1996] 2 Sri LR 268 at 276 Justice

Mark Fernando stated,

terms and conditions relating to the preferring of an appeal have been held to

be directory, in the absence of compelling language..

Accordingly, the provisions of laws in the absence of a compelling language are held to be

directory. Further, section 32 of the RTI Act does not provide for a mandatory provision as

the word may is used, however, these provisions can only be interpreted by considering the

facts of the case as a whole.

N.S. Bindra Interpretation of Statutes, 13th edition (2023), page 456 states as follows,

There is no fixed rule that will give an exact answer to the question of mandatory

and directory provisions. The various special rules deduced from the authorities offer

no more than a clue or guide to the character of a statutory provision. As a matter of

fact, some of the rules are so weighed with exceptions that it is difficult to fix their

value. Each individual case has to be decided on the basis of its facts. A realistic

approach to the problem is to utilise the recognised aids to construction with a view

to ascertaining the actual legislative intent. One of such sources is the purpose of the

statute, that is, the purpose with which the law was made. No statutory provisions are

intended by the legislature to be disregarded, but where the consequences of not

obeying them in every particular are not prescribed, the court must judicially

determine them. In doing so they must necessarily consider the importance of the

literal and punctilious observance of the provision in question to the object the

legislature had in view. If it is essential it is mandatory, and a departure from it is

Page 7 of 9

fatal to any proceeding to execute the statute or to obtain the benefit of it. The

difference between mandatory and directory statutes is one of effect only.

Accordingly, the preamble to the RTI Act aims to foster a culture of transparency and

accountability in public authorities, promote a society where citizens can more fully

participate in public life, combat corruption, and enhance good governance. Hence, the

provisions of the Act should be interpreted, considering the objectives of the legislature.

Therefore, by considering the purpose of the Act, it is noted that the time bar under section 32

is not mandatory but directory. Therefore, I do not find this to be a valid ground to object the

decision of the commission.

Section 31 of the Right to Information Act reads as follows,

31. (2) The designated officer shall issue a receipt on the acceptance of the appeal,

to the citizen making the appeal, and in any case within three working days.

(3) The decision on any appeal preferred under subsection (1), shall be made by the

designated officer within three weeks of the receipt of the appeal and shall include the

reasons for the said decision including specific grounds for the same.

According to section 31(2) of the Act, when an appeal is made under section 31(1), the

designated officer is required to issue a receipt on the acceptance of the appeal within three

working days, and the decision on the appeal shall be made within three weeks of the receipt

issued and shall also include the reasons for the decisions as well as the specific grounds.

The initial letter to access the information regarding the four items set above was sent by the

1st Respondent on 31st of December 2019 while the letter of acknowledgement was issued to

the 1st Respondent on 23rd of January 2020. The 1st Respondent contends that the rejection

letter was only shared by registered post on the 12th of February 2020, therefore has not

complied with the 14 days requirement under section 25(2) of the RTI Act.

Meanwhile, the appeal against the rejection of information was made by the 1st Respondent to

the designated officer of the ICASL on the 10th of February 2020. Accordingly, the reply for

the appeal was made to the 1st Respondent on 15th of April 2020, where the Petitioner has

disclosed information concerning item (1) and (4) and the item (2) and (3) has not been

disclosed on the basis that it is related to personal information exempted under section 5(1) of

the RTI Act. However, it should be noted that Petitioner has not abided by section 31 of RTI

Act as the designated officer has not issued a receipt on the acceptance of the appeal and the

decision regarding the appeal was not communicated to the 1st Respondent within three

weeks as prescribed under section 31(3). Moreover, the decision of the appeal was only

communicated to the 1st Respondent on 15th of April 2020, which is more than two months as

oppose to the three week period prescribed under section 31(3). Therefore, it is apparent that

the Petitioner himself has not adhered to the time restrictions in the Act and therefore now

cannot challenge the decision of the commission on the same ground as the Petitioner has not

come to this court with clean hands.

In the case of Chamara Samapath V. SL Parliament (2021) RTIC Appeal No.719/2018,

Sampath B Abayakoon, J held;

I am of the view that providing the list of names of the Members of Parliament who

have tendered their declaration of assets and liabilities as required by law is not

disclosing the information they have provided in the declarations. I find that the

argument advanced on that basis had also been an attempt to frustrate the purposes

of the RTI Act.

Members of Parliament are persons who are elected by the people and maintained by

the people. They are expected to abide by the laws of the country at all time and

provide examples for others to follow

.. It is therefore important for the public to know whether the relevant authorities

have acted as required by law or not. The only way to obtain that information would

be by seeking the list of the name of the Members of Parliament who have provided

their declarations under the RTI Act.

Item (2) requests the information regarding the person who lodged the complaint. As for the

Petitioner, the 1st Respondent is one of the complainants who made the complaint on the 6th

of June 2019, regarding the financial statement fraud in ICASL. Hence, revealing the names

of the complainants in this matter would not infringe upon their privacy or privileges in any

way.

Page 9 of 9

The Petitioner being a Public Authority is required to maintain transparency as it is the right

of each and every individual to know about the adjudicating body that would be dealing with

their complaints. Accordingly, the request made by the 1st Respondent in terms of item (3) is

an essential element in exercising his right to a fair hearing by knowing the members of the

ethics committee who investigated the complaints, and it cannot be denied. Further, the

process of knowing the members of the ethics committee shall ensure transparency in

handling complaints, which is crucial for maintaining accountability and trust in the system.

Therefore, I do not agree with the stand taken up by the Petitioner, that the information

requested would violate the rights and privileges of the Members of the Ethics Committee

who considered the complaint. I find that under no circumstances, providing such a list who

considered the complaint of the 1st Respondent would have an adverse effect to the relevant

members of the ethics committee or to the functioning of the Petitioner.

Therefore, I find no basis to disagree with the determination of the Commission. For the

reasons set out above, I find no merit in the grounds of appeal urged by the Petitioner.

The order delivered by the Right to Information Commission of Sri Lanka on the 9th of

February 2022 in the Appeal Inquiry RTI/Appeal/600/2021 is affirmed.

This appeal is dismissed.
