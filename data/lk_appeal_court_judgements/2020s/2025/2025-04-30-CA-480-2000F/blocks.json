No objections were taken in respect of such documents at the closing of the Defendant's case. Hence, the above documents were to be considered as proven documents. The learned District judge has failed to take notice of the fact that those documents have been proved in evidence. However, such documents have no bearing on issue No. 5, which concerns the applicability of the Rent Act. Further, no evidence has been led to support the position that the premises in dispute is governed by the Rent Act. Moreover, as mentioned above, as the Defendant failed to prove that he is the tenant of the premises, no question arises as to the applicability of the Rent Act to the subject premises. Thus, I am of the view that no material prejudice has been caused as a result of the above oversight.",
