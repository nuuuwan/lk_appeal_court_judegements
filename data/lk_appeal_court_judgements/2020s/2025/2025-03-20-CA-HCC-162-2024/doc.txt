JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) has

been indicted in the High Court of Chilaw in case no. HC 04/2020.

The charges in the indictment are as follows;

Charge 1

That during the period 21.08.2010 to 28.08.2010, at

Yogiyana, in the district of Puttalam, within the

jurisdiction of this Court, the accused-petitioner has

committed the offence of kidnapping, of a minor who was

less than sixteen (16) years of age at the time, from her

legal guardianship of one Ranasinghe Arachchige

Seneviratne, an offense punishable under section 354 of

the Penal Code.

3

Charge 2

That in the course of the same transaction, during the

period 22.08.2010 to 28.08.2010, at Polonnaruwa, the

accused-petitioner committed the offence of rape on the

said victim, who is under sixteen (16) years of age, and

have thereby committed an offense punishable under

section 364(2)(e) of the Penal Code as amended by Act

No.22 of 1995.

Charge 3

That in the course of the same transaction, during the

period 23.08.2010 to 28.08.2010, at Polonnaruwa, the

accused-petitioner committed rape on the said victim,

who is under sixteen (16) years of age, and have thereby

committed an offense punishable under section 364(2)(e)

of the Penal Code as amended by Act No.22 of 1995.

2. At the conclusion of the trial the appellant has been convicted of all

the charges referred to above and the Learned High Court Judge has

thereafter sentenced the appellant as follows;

Charge 1 Term of 11 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.

20,000.00 with a term of 2 months simple imprisonment

in default of payment of the fine.

Charge 2 Term of 11 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.

20,000.00 with a term of 2 months simple imprisonment

in default of payment of the fine.

Charge 3 Term of 11 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.

20,000.00 with a term of 2 months simple imprisonment

in default of payment of the fine.

And a sum of Rs. 200,000.00 as compensation to pay to PW1 with a term

of 12 months simple imprisonment in default of the payment of

compensation so ordered.

3. Being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentencing order the

appellant has preferred the instant appeal to this Court.

4. The Learned Counsel for the appellant informed Court that he

intended to limit the ground of appeal to the following;

i. That the sentence is excessive, therefore, could the Learned

High Court Judge have applied the principles laid down in

SC Reference 3/2008?

5. The Learned Counsel for the appellant has contended that the

sentences imposed on the appellant were extreme, and the sentence of

11 years each imposed in respect of the 2nd and 3rd charges are above

the minimum mandatory sentence imposed by statute. Additionally,

the Learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the following

mitigatory circumstances to be taken into consideration and a

variation of the sentences be made in favour of the appellant.

6. The following occurrences have been set out by the Learned Counsel

for the appellant in support of his contention;

i. That PW1 has eloped with the appellant and had known that

the appellant was a 26-year-old married man when PW1 did

so.

ii. That the evidence of PW1 has been contradicted by medical

evidence, thereby impairing the credibility of PW1.

PW1 has claimed that sexual intercourse occurred for the first time.

However, the medical results of the examination conducted by PW6

5

i.e. Dr. D. K. Wijewardhene have revealed findings that contradicted

her narrative. PW1s assertion that the encounter with the appellant

was her first experience of sexual intercourse raises significant

questions particularly in light of the medical evidence. It is vital to

consider how these inconsistencies affect the perception of the case

and it is important for the judicial process to rely on reliable evidence

to discern the facts of the situation. While personal accounts are

significant, they must be evaluated alongside medical evidence to

uncover the truth.

7. Thereafter, the Learned Deputy Solicitor General objecting to a

variance in the sentences imposed on the appellant has contended

that upon a careful analysis of the judgment in SC Reference

03/2008, the legal implications of the enactment of the proviso to

Article 13 (6) of the Constitution are not referred to in the last

concluding paragraph of such judgement. Further, the nature and

extent of the application of the proviso to Article 13(6) in light of the

conclusion of such judgment is not elaborated. Whether the said

judgement is applicable to an offence of any serious nature and if so,

the guidelines and the rules relating to the discretion are unknown,

though, there should be uniformity, consistency, and reliability in

sentencing procedures to sustain public trust and respect for the legal

system and remedies. Whether Articles 4(c), 11 and 12(1) are not in

conflict with the relevant proviso to Article 13(6) is not adverted to.

Therefore, the concluding paragraph of the judgment in SC Reference

03/2008 does not determine the status quo of Article 13 within the

context of Article 4 (c), 11 and 12(1) read with section 364(2)(i).

Further, it is also contended that the intention of the legislature in

enacting a minimum mandatory sentence should be considered vis a

vis the best interest of children and women victims of rape. Principles

relating to sentencing and potential adverse consequences and impact

of the leniency on statistics relating to sexual crimes should be

6

considered, as sexual offences are the rampant and most commonly

prevalent in society to an extent of endemic proportions, sentencing

implications for the society at large should be considered.

8. The long term impact on the society and the best interest of the

younger generation, is in peril with the rampant sex offenders which

does not augur well for the future generations. The rich Sri Lankan

culture is at risk. Also broken or disturbed young lives with their

educational prospects impeded, their lives steered off course and

potential psychological considerations ought to be of paramount

importance.

The case of the prosecution

9. PW1 had been a 15-year-old girl when the incidents referred to in the

offences had taken place in August 2010. The appellant being a 26-

year-old married man at that time had engaged in witchcraft and

provided his services to the family of PW1 as well as her relatives. The

appellant while providing his services has struck up an acquaintance

with PW1. The appellant has requested PW1 to meet him at the

Dankotuwa Town on the date referred to in the 1st charge. Thereafter,

has taken PW1 to Polonnaruwa, kept her at the appellant's sisters

house for three days and engaged in sexual intercourse with the latter

at the same time.

The case of the accused

10. The appellant had denied associating PW1 or engaging in sexual

intercourse with her.

7

11. To begin with, it is reasonable to consider the sentences prescribed

by law for the offences stated in the charges set out in the indictment.

12. Section 354 of the Penal Code is as follows;

Whoever kidnaps any person from Sri Lanka or from lawful

guardianship shall be punished with imprisonment of either

description for a term which may extend to seven years, and

shall also be liable to fine.

13. Section 364(2) of the Penal Code is as follows;

Whoever-

(a) being a public officer or person in a position of authority,

takes advantage of his official position, and commits rape on a woman in his official custody or wrongfully restraints and commits rape on a woman; (b) being on the management, or on the staff of a remand

home or other place of custody, established by or under law, or of a womens or childrens institution, takes advantage of his position and commits rape on any woman in mate of such remand home, place of custody or institution;

(c) being on the management or staff of a hospital, takes

advantage of his position and commits rape on a woman in that hospital;

(d) commits rape on a woman knowing her to be pregnant;

(e) commits rape on a woman under eighteen years of age;

(f) commits rape on a woman who is mentally or physically

disabled;

(g) commits gang rape;

8

shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not

less than ten years and not exceeding twenty years and with

fine and shall in addition be ordered to pay compensation of an

amount determined by court to the person in respect of whom

the offence was committed for the injuries caused to such

person;

Provided however, that where the offence is committed in

respect of a person under sixteen years of age, the court may,

where the offender is a person under eighteen years of age and

the intercourse has been with the consent of the person, impose

a sentence of imprisonment for a term less than ten years.

14. Accordingly, a minimum mandatory sentence has been prescribed in

respect of those convicted of committing the offences set out in

charges 2 and 3 in the indictment.

15. Minimum mandatory sentences represent a significant shift in the

criminal justice system, establishing fixed penalties for certain

offences regardless of the individual circumstances, whereby Judges

are bound to impose pre-determining sentences regardless of the

specifics of the case.

16. The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in SC Reference No. 03/2008 has

determined that a trial Judges discretion to reach to a conclusion as

regards to a sentence is not inhibited or controlled by a minimum

mandatory sentence imposed by a statute.

In SC Reference No.03/2008, the Supreme Court has held,

In the above circumstances we hold that the minimum

mandatory sentence in Section 364(2)(e) is in conflict with

9

Article 4(c), 11 and 12(1) of the Constitution and that the High

Court is not inhibited from imposing a sentence that it deems

appropriate in the exercise of its judicial discretion

notwithstanding the minimum mandatory sentence.

17. In Warnakulasooriya Mudiyanselage Jayanth Warnasuriya vs.

Attorney General CA/HCC/169/2022 decided on 09.12.2024,

Kulathunga, J, discussing the connotations of the judgment in SC

Reference 03/2008 has stated as follows;

Certainly, in view of SC Reference 3/2008 though a trial

Judge is neither shackled nor inhibited by the said minimum

mandatory sentence, is required to have regard to the fact that

a minimum mandatory sentence is so fixed. A court now

certainly has the discretion to impose a sentence of

imprisonment less than the prescribed minimum. However, I am

of the view that the Judge should have and there should be

some adequate reason/s to go below the said minimum

sentence. The court should mention such reasons in the

Judgment when awarding a sentence less than the prescribed

minimum. In order to exercise the discretion to impose a

sentence less than the minimum prescribed there should be and

the court has to record such reason/s which is adequate. This

to my mind should necessarily be some tangible and good

reason which is not fanciful. Thus, to my mind it is necessary

and prudent to assign and give the reason if and when a Judge

decides to impose a sentence below the minimum mandatory

fixed by law

18. Rape is a horrific offence that not only violates an individual's

physical anatomy but also inflicts profound psychological trauma

10

leaving lasting scars on victims. The seriousness of the offence

necessitates a robust legal response that serves not only to punish the

offender but also to deter potential future offences. Deterrent

punishment aims to convey a strong societal message that such

behavior will not be tolerated, thereby, fostering a sense of safety and

justice.

19. In determining the appropriate punishment, the Court is required to

consider the same from the point of view of the convict as well as the

public.

20. In Attorney General vs. H. N. de Silva 57 NLR 121, Basnayake,

ACJ, explaining the matters that should be taken into consideration in

determining a sentence has stated as follows;

In assessing the punishment that should be passed on an

offender, a Judge should consider the matter of sentence both

from the point of view of the public and the offender, Judges are

too often prone to look at the question only from the angle of the

offender. A Judge should, in determining the proper sentence,

first consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from the

nature of the act itself and should have regard to the

punishment provided in the Penal Code or other statute under

which the offender is charged. He should also regard the effect

of the punishment as a deterrent and consider to what extent it

will be effective. If the offender held a position of trust or

belonged to a service which enjoys the public confidence that

must be taken into account in assessing the punishment. The

incident of crimes of the nature of which the offender has been

found to be guilty and the difficulty of detection are also

matters which should receive due consideration. The

11

reformation of the criminal, though no doubt an important

consideration is subordinate to the others I have mentioned.

Where the public interest or the welfare of the State (which are

synonymous) outweighs the previous good character,

antecedents and age of the offender, public interest must

prevail.

21. Convictions for rape carry significant implications not just for the

victim but for the society as a whole ensuring that individuals

convicted of serious offences are dealt with appropriately is crucial for

justice and further deterrence of future offences. The legal

consequences imposed on individuals convicted of rape are designed

to reflect the seriousness of the crime.

22. S. N. Silva, J, as he was then, in assessing the aggravating

circumstances as regards to the offence of rape has stated as follows

in Attorney General vs. Ranasinghe [1993] 2 SLR 81,

It is also appropriate to cite an observation made by the

Lord Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal of England, with

regard to the sentence to be imposed for an offence of rape. In

the case of Roberts (4) at page 244. It was observed as follows;

Rape is always a serious crime. Other than in

wholly exceptional circumstances, it calls for an

immediate custodial sentence. This was certainly so in

the present case. A custodial sentence is necessary for a

variety of reasons. First of all to mark the gravity of the

offence. Secondly to emphasise public disapproval.

Thirdly to serve as a warning to others. Fourthly to

punish the offender, and last but by no means least, to

12

protect women. The length of the sentence will depend on

all the circumstances. That is a trite observation, but

these, in cases of rape vary widely from case to case.

In the case of, Keith Billam (5) the Lord Chief Justice

repeated the foregoing observations and stated that in a

contested case of rape a figure of five years imprisonment

should be taken as the starting point of the sentence, subject to

any aggravating or mitigating features. He observed further as

follows:-

The crime should in any event be treated as

aggravated by any of the following factors : (1) violence is

used over and above the force necessary to commit the

rape; (2) a weapon is used to frighten or wound the

victim; (3) the rape is repeated ; (4) the rape has been

carefully planned ; (5) the defendant has previous

convictions for rape or other serious offences of a violent

or sexual kind ; (6) the victim is subjected to further

sexual indignities or perversions ; (7) the victim is either

very old or very young ; (8) the effect upon the victim,

whether physical or mental, is of special seriousness.

Where any one or more of these aggravating features are

present, the sentence should be substantially higher than

the figure suggested as the starting point.

23. It is seen that several of these aggravating circumstances are present

in the instant case. The fact that PW1 was very young below the age

where she may have consented to sexual intercourse, the degree of

pre-planning by the appellant and the repeated commission of the

13

offence, are some of those aggravating circumstances. Public interest

demands that a custodial sentence be imposed on the appellant in

this case.

24. Accordingly, I set aside the sentence of 11 years rigorous

imprisonment imposed in respect of the offence stated in charge 1 and

sentence the appellant to 5 years rigorous imprisonment in respect of

such offence. Further, I refrain from interfering in the terms of

rigorous imprisonment imposed in respect of the offences set out in

the 2nd and 3rd charges. The fines imposed in respect of the offences

set out in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd charges and the sum ordered to be paid

as compensation to PW1 together with the terms of imprisonment

imposed in default of the payment of the same shall remain

unchanged. The substantive terms of rigorous imprisonment shall run

concurrently.

25. Subject to the above variation, the appeal stands dismissed.

I make no order with regard to costs.

26. The Registrar of this Court is requested to communicate this

judgment to the High Court of Chilaw for compliance.
