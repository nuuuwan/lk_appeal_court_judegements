Judgement Delivered on:15-09-2025

This is an appeal from a judgment of the Provincial High Court holden at Colombo in theexercise of its revisionary jurisdiction under Article 154 P (3) (b) of the Constitution. Bythe impugned judgment, the Learned High Court Judge has dismissed the revisionapplication filed against an order of the learned Additional Magistrate of Colombo madein terms of section 68 of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

The Officer-in-Charge of Police Station Foreshore had filed information on 13th August2018 in terms of Section 66 (1) (a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the PCPA) in the Magistrates Court of Colombo,reporting a dispute between the 1st Party-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter sometimesreferred to as the Appellant) and the 2nd Party-Respondent-Respondent (hereinaftersometimes referred to as the Respondent) regarding the possession of premisesNo.145 Jampettah, street Colombo 13 (a commercial building which appear to haveconsisted of two parts and for reasons not quite clear has sometimes been described asA Pradeshikaya and B Pradeshikaya. However, for reasons of clarity, I will refer tothem respectively as part A and part B under case bearing No. 97974/2018.

At the conclusion of the inquiry conducted under the PCPA, the learned Magistratedelivered her order on the 3rd April 2019, concluding that the Respondent had beendispossessed by the Appellant from the relevant part (part A) of the disputed premisesand therefore ordered that the Respondent be restored to possession under section 68(3)of the Primary Courts Act.

Being aggrieved by the learned Magistrate's order, the Appellant preferred a revisionapplication to the provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombounder HCRA 67/2019. The learned High Court Judge delivering his Judgement on 30th

September 2020 had dismissed the application, deciding that it was not a fit and propercase in which the court should exercise its revisionary powers.

Being dissatisfied with the judgment of the learned High Court Judge, the Appellant hasappealed to the Court of Appeal, challenging the said judgments of the High Court andthe Magistrate's Court.

Factual Matrix

The Appellant and the Respondent have advanced markedly divergent accountsconcerning the manner in which they came into possession of premises bearing No. 145,Jampettah Street, Colombo 13, as well as the sequence of events culminating in theinstitution of proceedings under the PCPA.

According to the affidavits submitted by the Respondent the premises bearing No. 145,Jampettah Street, Colombo 13 (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the premises)consisting of a store and a retail shop described respectively as part A and part Bbelonged to Colombo South Co-operative Society Ltd and the Society (Hereinaftersometimes known as the Society) been carrying out business from this premises for avery long time. The Respondent on 01-09-2010 had been employed by the Society as aManager however, as the Respondent had utilized his personal funds to repair firedamage to Part A of the premises, the Society had signed an agreement with theRespondent in April 2011 in order to reimburse the Respondent as regard the moneyowed to him (annexed to the affidavit as A4). Subsequently, as a result of the previousagreement or with regards to some other reason, on 16-08-2017, the Society had signedanother agreement (annexed to the affidavit as A7) with the Respondent, which hadentrusted the administration and property of the premises to the Respondent for threeyears from that date, making him much more than a mere employee. This agreement wasin force at the time of the dispute.

On 22-07-2018 an employee of the Respondent had made a complaint to the Fore Shorepolice station stating that, at about 5.00 in the morning about 15 persons forcedthemselves into the building and ordered them to vacate the premises, and on 24-07-2018 Gunawardana Bandara the General Manager of the Society making a complaint hasstated the manager of the Societies outlet at No. 145 Jampettah street, Colombo 13 hadinformed him that the Appellant, a person named Jayantha Rodrigo and others areharassing the employees.

On 25-07-2018, the General Manager of the Society and the Appellant had been called tothe police station, and the Appellant had promised to keep the peace by not harassingthe employees of the Society and to settle their dispute by litigation. However, on 10-08-2018, a group of persons affiliated to the Appellant entered the section designated Part Aof the premises by breaking the padlocks and thereby forcibly dispossessed theRespondent from that part of the premises. This act, captured on film by CCTV, had beensubmitted to the Court subsequently.

The version of events according to the Appellant is that by deed No 4212 dated 19-07-2018, he purchased the disputed premises, which comprised two sections, designatedpart A and part B, from a person named Jayantha Rodrigo. The appellant has furtherstated that although he has received vacant possession from Jayantha Rodrigo, it wasknown that previously the Respondent had been operating a retail shop called Co-opShop in part B of the premises, while Jayantha Rodrigo was in possession of the rest ofthe building, which is mentioned as part A.

Appellant claims that on 22-07-2018, the Respondent entered part B with some othersand attempted to carry out some construction activities. Although he (Appellant)prevented this, the Respondent and three others continued to illegally occupy thissection. Further, the complaint made by the Respondent dated 10-08-2018 that theRespondent was dispossessed by him is completely false.

Analysis of the relative positions

On perusal of the nature of evidence presented at the Magistrate Court, it appears thatthe Respondent has produced overwhelming evidence to establish that he was inpossession of not only part A of the premises but the entirety of the premises.

The agreement between the Society and the Respondent goes back to 2011.Letters from Colombo South Co-operative Society Confirming the Respondent'sposition.Photographs taken from CCTV footage of intruders entering the premises.Affidavits by residents of the area. Receipts of payment of rates to the Municipality Electricity bill payments

As against the above, the Appellant had relied upon a disputed deed of transfer andaffidavits by his employees. Further, the Police observations as submitted by InspectorH.S. De Silva and the police statements made prior to dispossession have also beenconsidered by the learned Magistrate in making the order in favour of the Respondent.

In his judgment of the revision application, the learned High Court Judge has not foundany error by the learned Magistrate that would vitiate the order of the learnedMagistrate. While confirming the said order, the learned High Court Judge citingWijesinghe Vs. Tharmaratnam1 , Vanik Incorporation Ltd. Vs. Jayasekara2 and

Caderamanpulle vs. Ceylon Paper Sacks Ltd3 has quite rightly concluded that thePetitioner (Appellant in the instant appeal) has not been able to satisfy the thresholdrequirement for a revision application to be considered, not demonstrating the existenceof exceptional grounds.

The Appellant has based this instant application inter alia on the following grounds;

The failure to consider the initial information filed by the officer in charge of the ForeShore police station, and improper reliance on a different investigating officers report

It was held in Krishnamoorthi Sivakumar vs. Pathima Johara Packer4 that inProceedings under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act; the Law requiresParties to file only Affidavits and documents in support of their claims and Oral Evidenceis an exception in a fit Case to be permitted at the discretion of Court.

In the instant case, the learned Magistrate had not only obtained oral evidence but alsodirected the police for further investigations. However, there is no illegality in theseactions as the learned Magistrate is not prevented by law.

In Ranjith Mervyn Ponaamperuma Vs. Warahena Lyanage Viraj Pradeep Kumara De Alwis and others,5 Dr. Ruwan Fernando J has stated;

A wide discretion has been given to the Primary Court judge under

section 72 to decide on the type of evidence and material on which heshould act in making his determination under section 68 (1) or 68 (3) ofthe Act. The only limitation is that he must act judicially and as far aspracticable, depending on the circumstances of each case.

Further, it would appear that the learned Magistrate has disregarded information filed bythe officer in charge of the Fore Shore police station, as the learned Magistrate had cometo a conclusion with good reason that the then officer in charge of the Fore Shore policestation appeared to be biased towards the Appellant. I tend to agree with the view ofthe learned magistrate, as the information filed by him dated 13-08-2018 appears tounduly favour the Appellant.

Although the learned Magistrate considering subsequent reports (not available to theAppellant) prepared by Inspector H.S De Silva and ASP Senaka Ratwatte cannot be

justified, however, I agree with the learned High Court Judge that it has not occasioned amiscarriage of justice because even if those reports are disregarded, the remainingevidence is sufficient to prove that the Respondent was in possession of the property indispute.

The fact that the Appellant possessed a valid deed was ignored

The jurisdiction given to a Primary Court under Section 66 is special and quasi-criminal.Its main purpose is to prevent a breach of the peace in disputes over land.6 In an inquiryunder Section 66 of the PCPA, the duty of the Magistrate is to preserve the status quoand prevent a breach of the peace; hence, the Appellants reliance on a disputed titledeed is of little relevance in these proceedings. The law recognises that even a lawfulowner is not entitled to oust a possessor by force. The possession, whether lawful orotherwise, enjoys protection, and even a trespasser cannot be displaced save by dueprocess. The proper course for the Appellant, if he seeks to vindicate his title, lies ininstituting appropriate proceedings before the Civil Court. As the Supreme Court hasaffirmed7, the Primary Court is bound to uphold the possession of a mere user or personin de facto occupation, without reference to title, provided such possession is establishedfor the time being.

Improper use of CCTV evidence

The Appellant contends that, although photographs were produced depicting personsentering certain premises, no proof was furnished to establish that the location was theA Pradeshikaya (Part A) of the disputed property. However, in these proceedings, theburden of proof is not one of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and the photographswere assessed in conjunction with the averments in the affidavits rather than in isolation.If the Appellant sought to challenge this fact, he was at liberty to adduce evidence to thateffect. While the Appellant has denied forcibly entering the premises, he has failed toprovide any explanation for the photographs.

In Shanmugasundara Kurrukkal Sriskandarajah Kurukkal vs Ramalingham Nadarajah8 HisLordship Justice A.H.M.D. Nawaz has stated:

In light of the failure on the part of the Respondents to respond to thespecific allegation of the Appellant, I take the view that such failure in the

affidavit evidence would amount to an admission. Silence in court may beused to strengthen inferences from opposing evidence.

Although the Appellant has entered a denial, I find that, in light of the weight of evidenceestablishing forcible entry, the bare denial contained in the Appellants affidavit dated19.01.2019 is insufficient.

High Courts misinterpretation of the Appellants position

In delivering his judgment on the revision application, and with reference to thesettlement entered into on 25.07.2018 at the Fore Shore Police Station betweenGunawardana Bandara, the General Manager of the Cooperative Society, and theAppellant, the learned High Court Judge, upon analysing the facts, observed:

It could be observed that the said settlement does not refer to a particularpart of the building, but covers the entire premises. Had the petitioner been inpossession of part A of the building as alleged in the affidavit, he could nothave consented for the said settlement. The above fact alone is sufficient toinfer that the Petitioner although stated that he had purchased the building indispute by deed No 4212 on 19.07.2018, he was never in possession of thesame. Hence, it is evident that the Petitioner was not handed over thepossession of the property by the vendor of deed No 4212.

It appears that the Appellant is challenging conclusions drawn by the learned High CourtJudge in analysing the Appellant's participation in the settlement process. The wording ofparagraph 14 of the Appellants written submissions dated 05.11.2024 is, like much of hisassertions, ambiguous. However, it appears that the Appellant seeks to convey that hisparticipation in the settlement discussions was based on a mistaken belief that theCooperative Society was in a position to honour the terms of the agreement.

Where there is no indication that the opposing party failed to observe the terms of thesettlement subsequent to its conclusion, the contention advanced by the Appellantappears untenable. It further carries the implication that the Respondent and not theSociety, was, in fact, the party exercising authority.

The Appellant has disputed the Respondents right to possession of the premises.However, as already addressed in this judgment, by virtue of the agreement between theCo-operative Society and the Respondent (marked A7), the Respondent ceased to be amere employee. Having regard to the cumulative effect of the terms of that agreement, itis evident that for all intended purposes the Respondent was in control of the premises

and as such the Respondent could, and indeed should, be regarded as the person inpossession.

On behalf of the Appellant, it was contended that due consideration had not been givento the Respondents statement to the police dated 08.07.2018, wherein he describedhimself as merely an employee of the Co-operative Society. However, the agreement bywhich the property at No. 145, Jampettah Street, Colombo 13 was entrusted to theRespondent expressly stipulates that he would not acquire ownership of the movable andimmovable property entrusted to him and would continue to remain as an employee ofthe Co-operative Society. Accordingly, there is no ambiguity as to the status of theRespondent.

Upon examination of the revision application filed by the Appellant in the High Court, theAppellant has not demonstrated that the learned Magistrate has acted withoutjurisdiction, failed to exercise jurisdiction, or committed any material irregularity in theexercise thereof. The grievances advanced are confined to matters of factual assessmentrather than jurisdictional error or illegality. I am therefore in agreement with the learnedHigh Court Judge that no exceptional circumstances have been established to justifyinterference with the order of the Magistrate.

For the aforesaid reasons, I am not inclined to interfere with the decisions of the learnedJudge of the High Court or the learned Magistrate. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissedsubject to costs.
