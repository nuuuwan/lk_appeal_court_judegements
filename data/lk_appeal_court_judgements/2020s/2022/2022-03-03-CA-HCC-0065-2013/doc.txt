R. Gurusinghe, J.

Two accused-appellants (the appellants) were indicted in the High Court

of Gampaha for committing the murder of Paularachchige Mahinda

Gerard, on or about the 19th of May 2009 at Udugampola, an offence

punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code. After pleading not guilty

to the charge, the appellants preferred to have the trial before the Judge

without a jury.

The prosecution led the evidence of PW1, PW3, PW7, PW8, PW6, PW10,

PW9 and the court interpreter. At the conclusion of the case for the

prosecution, the two appellants made a dock statement denying the

allegation levelled against them.

The case for the prosecution is as follows:

The deceased had been transporting a pile of wood in a hand tractor

along Sanasa Road that leads to Minuwangoda. The daughter of the

deceased PW1 and two other children had been in the tractor at the time

of the incident. On the way, two men covering their faces armed with

swords ambushed the deceased. The deceased then ran along the Sanasa

Road as the assailants chased him. The tractor hit a pole and the

children also jumped out of the tractor. PW1 had recognized the

attackers as the appellants. PW1 had also run after them and witnessed

the incident about fifteen feet away from the other side of the road, where

the appellants struck the deceased on his neck with the sword. The first

appellant's face covering was removed for a while. The second appellant

was also identified. The second appellant had a missing finger. The two

appellants were neighbours of PW1. She knew them since her childhood.

The appellants then fled the place of the crime, and PW3 had taken the

deceased to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

The case for the Defense is as follows

The first appellant in his dock statement took up the position that he

was at his wife's parents' house on the day of the incident. He further

said that the police forced him to furnish the knife. The second appellant

stated in his dock statement that he had worked with the deceased about

three years ago and when he had tried to remove a log, he lost a finger.

At that time, the deceased had taken him to the hospital. He said that

4

the deceased had many enemies, and he had nothing to do with the

murder of the deceased.

After the trial, the appellants were found guilty and sentenced to death

by the learned High Court Judge.

Three grounds of appeal relied on by the appellants are set out as

follows:

1) The evidence relating to identification suffers from serious

infirmities, which renders the conviction unsafe.

2) The Learned Trial Judge has failed to evaluate the evidence

relating to the identification in its correct judicial perspective,

addressing her mind to the inherent weaknesses in the evidence

relating to the identification.

3) The evidence relating to the government analyst report is

inadmissible.

It was argued for the appellants that the evidence of a sole child

eyewitness, is not reliable relating to the identification. The reason for

this argument was based on the fact that at the time of the incident, the

assailants covered their faces revealing only their eyes. Further, it was

submitted that where the conviction revolves around identification, the

duty is cast upon the Trial Judge to examine very closely and cautiously

the circumstances under which the identification came to be made and

the basis of the identification so as to exclude all probabilities of

mistaken identity as visual identification is susceptible to mistake. Even

honest witnesses are liable to be mistaken.

PW1 was thirteen years old at the time of the incident and she was

sixteen years old at the time of giving evidence in court. In the case of

5

Tehal Singh and others vs the state of Punjab AIR 1979 SC 1347, the

Supreme Court of India held that common sense and progress of the

witness at the age of thirteen may be equivalent to that of a perfectly

natural person.

PW1's evidence does not suffer from any infirmity as argued for the

appellant. She was cross-examined at length, and nothing elicited from

her, which could attribute to the mistaken identity of the appellants.

There was nothing to show that she was lying or tutored. She had given a

statement to the police on the same evening. The defence elicited from a

police officer PW7, that PW1 had made a statement to the police on the

20th of May 2009. But he said that he had not recorded her statement.

The person who recorded her statement was PW9. He categorically stated

that he had recorded the statement from PW1 at 20.10 on the 19thof May

2009, that is, on the same day of the incident. The defence did not

contest this position. PW1 said that she had made a statement on the

same day on which her father was killed. That was also not disputed in

the cross-examination.

The defence never suggested to PW1 that she was not able to identify the

assailants as their faces were covered. PW1 never referred to the

appellants as somebody. She always referred to them as and

. The appellants are neighbours and are known people to PW1

since her childhood. PW1 had said that the first appellant had removed

the cloth he had used to cover his face at one point.

The only contradiction marked as V1 is as follows:

.

She said . It

seems to be a vital contradiction when this portion is taken in isolation.

However, her statement regarding the identity of assailants is thus:

(Question by the police)

:

When considering the entire answer to the question, the portion marked

as contradiction is not a vital contradiction. This discrepancy, therefore,

does not go to the root of the prosecution case. In the cross-

examination, the only suggestion put to PW1 was that;

: ?

. ( ).

The defence has carefully avoided asking PW1 whether she was not able

to identify the assailants, as their faces were covered with cloth. Even the

defence inquired from PW1 whether the appellants were very well known

to her.

This shows that the appellants are not strangers to PW1. PW1 never said

that she believes that these two appellants committed this incident.

Howeverdefence counsel asked the following questions:

The answers PW1 has given to the aforementioned questions that were

asked shows that she did in fact witness the incident in which her father

was murdered.

The defence of the first appellant stated in his dock statement is that he

was not in the village on that day of the incident. However, this was not

taken up when examining PW1 or any other witnesses. Similarly, the

defence of the second appellant was also not put forward to PW1.

In the case of Gunasiri and two others vs Republic of Sri Lanka 2009 1

SRI LR 39, Sisira de Abrew J. held as follows:

"Although the 3rd accused-appellant raised an alibi in his dock

statement, he failed to suggest this position to prosecution witnesses.

The Learned Counsel who appeared for the defence did not suggest to the

prosecution witnesses the alibi raised by the 3rd accused-appellant.

What is the effect of such silence on the part of the Counsel. In this

connection, I would like to consider certain judicial decisions. In the case

of Sarwan Singh vs. State of Punjab at 3656 Indian Supreme Court held

thus: "It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has

declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross

examination it must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue

ought to be accepted." This judgment was cited with approval in Bobby

Mathew vs. State of Kamatakal. Applying the principles laid down in the

above judicial decision, I may express the following view. Failure to

suggest the defence of alibi to the prosecution witnesses who implicated

the accused indicates that it was a false one. Considering all these

matters, I am of the opinion that the defence of alibi raised by the 3rd

accused-appellant is an after thought."

Therefore, the positions taken up in the dock statements of the

appellants do not create a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case.

Another point taken up by the appellants was that PW1 being a thirteen-

year-old girl, does not have the capability to run a distance of two

hundred and fifty feet, keeping pace with the assailants. A 13-year-old

9

child's capability of running depends on various factors. She may even

be able to run faster than the appellants. These are subjective factors

that do not warrant a doubt on the evidence of PW1.

The Counsel for the appellants argued that the evidence is that the

assailants attacked the deceased on the posterior of the neck. Still, the

medical evidence is that the deceased had three injuries, only one being

on the posterior of the neck, whilst the other two were on the arm and

on the front of the neck. Therefore, the argument with the evidence of the

eyewitness conflicts with the medical evidence. This argument is not

correct.

At page 47 PW1 said as follows:

Thus, there is no conflict between the eyewitness's account and the

medical evidence.

The next argument is that PW1 said that her father's sarong had come

out and fallen while running, and at the time of the attack, he was clad

only in a shirt and underwear. As per the police and medical evidence,

the deceased had a sarong. Both the police officer and the doctor

inspected the body of the deceased at the hospital. PW3 had taken the

deceased to the hospital. PW3 would have definitely put the sarong on

the deceased before taking him to the hospital. If there was a doubt on

the evidence of PW1, the defence should have questioned PW1. This

position was not even put forward to PW3. Without such being

questioned by either PW1 or PW3, the argument of the appellants cannot

be sustained to create doubt in the evidence of PW1. Further, it is highly

unlikely that someone would take an injured person to a hospital naked

without covering him first. This argument, therefore, cannot be accepted.

The next argument is that PW1 had not mentioned any physical features

on the assailant, such as height, gait or other particulars in her

statement, to the police. The necessity for such things did not arise here

as she had categorically stated the names of the appellants and the

police had no reason to ask about the physical features when the witness

named the assailants. PW1 knew the assailant very well as they were

neighbours.

It was argued that no reasons had been adduced by the Learned Trial

Judge for placing reliance on the evidence of the eyewitness. This is not

so. The Learned Trial Judge has given reasons as to why she relied on

the evidence of PW1. We also do not see reasons to doubt the evidence of

PW1. The Learned Trial Judge has observed that, at the time the

deceased was taken to the hospital, the names of the assailants were

made known to the hospital police post. They have informed the incident

11

to the Gampaha police station at 6.50 pm with the names of the

assailants. There was no delay by PW1. PW1 had given a statement on

the same day within a few hours, stating the appellant's name as the

assailants. The cross-examination did not shake the evidence of PW1.

A knife was recovered in consequence of the information received from

the first appellant. There was human blood on the knife. The government

analyst's report marked as P11 proves this fact. In the appeal,it was

argued that the government analyst's report should not have been

admitted without calling the analyst.

The prosecution has called the police witness PW9, who had taken the

knife to the Government analyst and had marked the receipt issued by

the government analyst as P7. A clerk who was entrusted to the

productions of the Magistrate Court of Gampaha wasalso called to prove

this fact. The interpreter of the court has produced the letter issued by

the Magistrate Court of Gampaha as P10 and the Government Analyst

report as P11. These witnesses were not cross-examined. No objection

was taken to marking the government analyst report.

Section 414 of the Criminal Procedure Code Act No. 15 of 1979, as

amended by Act No.11 of 1998, are as follows:

Amendment of section 414 of the principal enactment

6. Section 414 of the principal enactment is hereby amended as follows:-

(a) by the repeal of subsection (1) of that section and the substitution

therefore, of the following subsection:

(1) Any document purporting to be a report under the land of the

Government Analyst, the Government Examiner of Questioned

12

Documents, the Registrar of Finger Prints, Examiner of Motor Vehicles

or Government Medical Officer upon any person, matter or thing duly

submitted to him for examination or analysis and report, or the report

of a Government Medical Officer based upon any skiagraph purporting

to have been made by a Government Radiologist or such skiagraph

itself and any document purporting to be a report under the band of

such Radiologist upon such skiagraph, may be used as evidence in

any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code although such

officer is not called as a witness.

Therefore this argument cannot be accepted. However, there is sufficient

evidence to justify the verdict of the Trial Judge even without the

evidence of the Government Analyst's report.

The evidence of PW1 does not suffer from any infirmity, which warrants

to doubt the evidence. The identities of the appellants were proved

beyond reasonable doubt.

For the reasons set out above, the appeals of the appellants are

dismissed.

Appeal Dismissed.
