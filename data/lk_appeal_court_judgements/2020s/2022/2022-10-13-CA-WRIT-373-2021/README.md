Before : Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

Dhammika Ganepola J.

Counsel : N. M. Riyaz with G. B. Madhushani Chandrika for the Petitioner.

Kapila Liyanagamage with Tharindi Karunaratne for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents. Yuresha Fernando, DSG with Shemanthi Dunuwille, SC for the 4th to 11th Respondents Supported on : 16.09.2022 and 21.09.2022

Decided on : 13.10.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner is a company incorporated under the Companies Act No. 7 of 2007 in

which eighteen members hold approximately 30 permits to ply the expressway within the

Western Province. The Petitioner complains that the 1st Respondent has issued route

permits outside the tender procedure which has caused great prejudice to the Petitioner.

The Petitioner in the instant application is seeking, inter alia, a mandate in the nature of a

writ of Certiorari to quash a tender notice, marked P6, published on 30.07.2021.

The Petitioner states that the 8th Respondent is entitled to issue route permits in respect of

the routes between Provinces and the 1st Respondent is entitled to issue passenger route

permits in respect of routes within the Western Province.

The Petitioner contends that by letter dated 06.02.2022, marked P3 and letter marked

P4, the Petitioner continuously complained to the 6th Respondent, among other matters,

about issuing route permits outside the tender procedures by the 1st Respondent Authority

and has requested the 6th Respondent to conduct an inquiry against the said 1st

Respondent. Though such complaints were made, the Petitioner alleges that on

30.07.3021 by tender notice marked P6, the 1st Respondent wrongfully called for tenders

in respect of various routes within the Western Province.

Page 4 of 5

One of the main arguments of the Petitioner is that the said tender procedure has been

conducted in a manner which violated the States guidelines and practices and obligation

on tender procedure.

The Petitioner submits that calling of tenders by P6 by the 1st Respondent is wrongful,

unreasonable, irrational and contrary to law due to several reasons such as;

i. the purported tender is issued to fill an alleged shortfall but there is no shortfall in

respect of omnibuses plying the expressway routes.

ii. the routes that failed to perform after the previous tenders made in 2015, 2016, 2017

and/or 2018 are also included in the current tender.

iii. new routes are included in the tender without any proper basis or justification.

iv. the purported tender contains routes that ply within the expressway for a short

distance and thereafter travel a longer distance over the highway which is contrary

to the stated policy towards centralisation of expressway buses to the nearest entry

and exist points of the expressway.

v. the 1st Respondent has not even planned for the creation of bus stands on the routes

advertised.

vi. the purported tender includes provisions that infringe upon vested rights of the

Petitioner and other route permit holders.

However, I take the view that the Petitioner has failed to establish prima facie any of the

above grounds by way of material evidence. It is important to note that the vital

stakeholders including relevant bus owners who would be affected by any order of this

Court in the event the Petitioner will be saucerful in this application are not before Court.

Based on the circumstances of this application, I am of the view that there should be an

abuse of power by the 2nd Respondent in exercising his duties, for the Petitioner to invoke

the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court. It is observed that the Petitioner has not tendered

adequate materials/evidence to exhibit that the 1st Respondent has breached the due

process when publishing the tender notice marked P6.

When considering the date of the publication of the tender notice, it is evident that more

than a period of one year has lapsed after the issuance of the said tender notice. Therefore,

a question would arise on the maintainability of the instant application as the Petitioner is

challenging only the tender notice marked P6. Further, the closing date for submitting

Page 5 of 5

bids was on 20.08.2021, but the Petitioner has failed to inform this Court whether tenders

have already been granted to any successful bidders. I take the view that even if the Court

examines the substance of the alleged arguments of the Petitioner, the final result will be

futile as the operational period of the impugned tender notice has come to an end on

20.08.2021.

On 03.06.2022, the Petitioner was permitted to file an amended Petition in order to

circumvent any resistance to the maintainability of the application. However, the

Petitioner has failed to file an amended Petition and accordingly has not taken prompt

action to prosecute this application with due diligence.

As discussed by this Court in Prof. D.G. Harendra de Silva & others vs. Hon. Pavithra

Wanniarachchi Minister of Health & others, CA/Writ/422/2020 decided on 01.02.2022, the

judge needs to be satisfied that there is a proper basis for claiming judicial review, and it is

wrong to grant permission without identifying an appropriate issue on which the case can

properly proceed (See-R vs. Social Security Commissioner ex p. Pattni (1993) 5 Admin LR

219 at 223G). Thus, the Petitioner, in my view, has not made out an arguable case or a

prima facie case for this Court to consider issuance of notice.

For the reasons set out above, I am of not inclined to issue formal notice of this application

on the Respondents and I proceed to refuse this application.

I agree.
