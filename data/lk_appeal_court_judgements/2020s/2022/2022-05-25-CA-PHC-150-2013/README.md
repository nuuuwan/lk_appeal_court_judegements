Judgment

The Officer in Charge of Police Station-Padukka had filed an information under Section 66 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 in case bearing No. 98553 in the Magistrates Court

of Awissawella in order to prevent the breach of the peace threatened or likely to be threatened

among the parties.

Page 3 of 8

The said information was filed in pursuant to a complaint made by one Vajira Kalyani

Padmaperuma, the 1st Party-Respondent, stating that Kalupahanage Somadasa (Deceased), the

original 2nd Party-Respondent, had interrupted using of the roadway by 1st Party-Respondent by

way of constructing a wooden fence in front of the land belonging to 2nd Party-Respondent

depicted in lot 5 in plan bearing No. 1175, marked 12, 20 feet in length and the said fence has

been constructed so as to encroach about 6 feet of the said roadway.

Apparently, both the 1st Party-Respondent and 2nd Party-Respondent had filed affidavits, counter

affidavits and also written submissions at the inquiry and the matter was fixed for Order on

12.06.2008.

However, both parties agreed to enter to a settlement in respect of the width of the roadway

mentioned in survey plan bearing No. 1175 dated 29.08.1946 made by A.C.S. Rodriguez licensed

surveyor. The attention of Court was drawn to the relevant portion of the settlement entered on

12.06.2008.

It was submitted on behalf of the 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant that on 10.10.2008

the 1st Party Respondent supported the matter requesting for a court commission, with no notice

to the Appellant. Pursuant to the said commission, plan No. 586 dated 02.12.2008 was made by

Mr. Asoka Welikalavithanage Licensed Surveyor. The said plan and report was produced to Court

on 03.12.2008. It was further submitted that as per the settlement entered on 12.06.2008, the parties

agreed on the roadway as described in the survey plan No. 1175 dated 29.08.1946. However, in

plan No. 586, the roadway is not identical to what is marked in plan No. 1175. As such, 2nd Party-

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant had objected to the court commissioners plan through his

Attorney-at-Law.

Page 4 of 8

Thereafter, the 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant filed a revision application bearing No.

29/2009 dated 02.03.2009 in the Provincial High Court of Avissawella. Apparently, by Order dated

01.04.2009, the learned High Court Judge dismissed the said revision application holding that the

learned Magistrates Order was for further steps and thereby gives the party an opportunity to

make submissions on the matter.

In the meantime, the 1st Party Respondent obtained a writ of possession according to plan No. 586.

On 17.03.2009 the fiscal has filed his report on the fulfillment of the terms of settlement to Court.

As per to the fiscal report, possession was handed over according to plan No. 586, thus the

Appellant contended that it is contrary to the terms of settlement.

The 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant filed objections by way of written submissions and

the 1st Party Respondent also filed counter objections by way of written submissions.

Thereafter, the learned Magistrate delivered the Order on 12.06.2009, held that although the 2nd

Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant claims that the roadway in commission plan No. 586 dated

02.12.2008 is not identical to the roadway described in plan No. 1175, the Appellant has not

objected to it at the time the survey was done. Further, the learned Magistrate held that though the

parties were present in Court twice after the fiscals report was produced, no objections were taken

up by the parties. Therefore, the learned Magistrate held that there is no reason to set aside the

Commission or the new plan, as no prejudice was caused to the Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the 2nd Party Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant had filed a

revision application bearing No. PHC 70/2009, in the Provincial High Court of Avissawella.

It is to be noted that when this matter was taken up for argument, the parties agreed to have the

Surveyor General to prepare a new plan and the roadway to be demarcated according to plan No.

1175. However, the survey that was carried out by the Surveyor General included part of a land

which belonged to one Tharuka Amarasekara and thereafter she intervened to the case as the

Intervenient Respondent.

The Intervenient Respondents petition had been taken up for inquiry on 27.02.2013. On that date,

the parties agreed to set aside the commission issued to the Surveyor General. As a result, the

Page 5 of 8

learned High Court Judge made an Order setting aside the said commission and fixed the matter

for hearing as between the original parties to the revision application. Since the impugned dispute

arose only between the 1st Party Respondent and the 2nd Party Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant,

there is no reason for the Intervenient Respondent to be aggrieved by the said Order, setting aside

to issue a commission to the Surveyor General and her rights would not be prejudiced.

After the hearing of the said application, the learned Provincial High Court Judge of Avissawella

by Order dated 18.09.2013 held that even though the parties have not prayed to set aside the

settlement dated 12th June 2008, the High Court has special power to set aside any Order made by

the lower Court, if the said order causes injustice to a party. Therefore, the learned Judge set aside

all orders made in relation to the settlement dated 12th June 2008 stating the practical difficulty to

come for a settlement based on a plan made in the year 1946. The learned Judge further directed

the learned Magistrate to take steps to remove all obstructions specified in the observation notes

made by Police Sergeant 9357. It states that;

Against the said order of the learned Provincial High Court Judge of Awissawella dated

18.09.2013, the 2nd Party Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant [hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Appellant] had preferred this appeal seeking the following reliefs.

1. Affirm the part of the Order dated 18.09.2013 made by the learned High Court Judge wherein

she set aside the following Orders/decisions by the learned Magistrate/Primary Court Judge-

a) To issue the court commission to the surveyor as requested by the motion dated 10.10.2008

filed by the Attorney-at-Law for the 1st Party Respondent;

b) To take steps as per plan No. 586 dated 02.12.2008;

c) To handover possession according to plan No. 586 as requested by motion dated

27.02.2009 by the 1st Party Respondent;

d) To file the report demarcating the roadway marked as Lot. 1 in plan No. 586 dated

17.03.2009 made by Ashoka Welikalavithanage Licensed Surveyor; and

Page 6 of 8

e) The Order dated 12.06.2009.

2. Set aside the part of the Order dated 18.09.2013 made by the learned High Court Judge wherein

she ordered to remove all obstructions as per the notes of Police Sergeant 9357.

As such, it is clear that the Appellant affirm a part of the said Order and challenges a part of the

Order, in which it was ordered to remove the obstructions made by the Appellant.

Apparently, the learned High Court Judge in the said Order dated 18.09.2013 decided that the

settlement dated 12.06.2008 could not be implemented practically, and made Order setting aside

the said settlement.

However, instead of sending the case back to the Primary Court for fresh inquiry, the learned High

Court Judge makes a determination that the Appellant has made the obstructions that are

mentioned in the Police Sergeants observation notes, and directs the said obstructions to be

removed. Thus, the Appellant contended that the impugned Order is an illegal Order that cannot

stand.

It was the contention of the Appellant that the learned High Court Judge is at fault, when she was

relying on the observation notes of the Police Sergeant as effectively conclusive evidence, without

any analysis of the evidence adduced by the parties before the Primary Court in their respective

affidavits and counter affidavits.

The attention of Court was drawn to the observation notes dated 02.03.2008 made by Police

Sergeant 9358.

According to the observation notes, there is a wooden fence about 20 feet in length built

approximately 2-3 days prior to his visit, which is obstructing the roadway leading to the house of

the 1st Party-Respondent. He further observed that the roadway is 8 feet wide and the fence was

built encroaching 6 feet of the roadway.

It was submitted by the Appellant that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the fact

that the fence was built after it was destroyed by the 1st Party Respondent to take a three-wheeler

into lot No. 6, which is the reason why the fence appeared to be new.

Page 7 of 8

Furthermore, the learned High Court Judge based her Order entirely on the observation report,

which was made only in the presence of the aggrieved party. There was no representation made

by the Appellant. As such, it was alleged that the Police Sergeant tends to be biased in his report

as he comes to the conclusion that the Appellant has encroached the roadway without knowledge

of the original demarcation of the roadway. Therefore, the Order made by the learned High Court

Judge based on these observations are prejudicial towards the Appellant and a violation of natural

justice.

In this respect, it is noteworthy the observations made by the Police Sergeant 9358;

.

. .

.

As such, it is worthy to note that as per the appellants said position, at the time of inspecting the

premises in dispute and making observations, only the aggrieved party was present and it was done

in the absence of the Appellant, which contradicts the said observation report. Thus, the Appellant

was at the disputed premises at the relevant time and refused to make a statement. Apparently, the

Appellant had mislead Court by saying that he was not present at the relevant time of inspecting

the premises in dispute.

It was the contention of the Appellant that the learned High Court Judge committed a grave error

in Law by relying on the observation notes of the Police Sergeant as conclusive evidence without

any analysis of the evidence adduced by the parties before the Primary Court Judge in their

respective affidavits and counter affidavits.

It appears that the Appellants said contention is erroneous for the reason that the learned High

Court Judge in her Order dated 18.09.2013, specifically analyzed the evidence placed before the

learned Primary Court Judge and had come to the correct findings of fact and Law and decided the

dispute between the parties.

The said Order states that;

, ,

.

Page 8 of 8

Therefore, it is apparent that the learned High Court Judge had analyzed the evidence adduced

before the Primary Court and had come to the correct conclusion and made the impugned Order,

in which we see no reason to interfere with.

It is clear that the impugned dispute in the instant case is purely civil in nature. Therefore, the

learned High Court Judge has made an Order directing the parties to resolve the matter in a

competent jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter.

Further, the learned High Court Judge had directed the learned Primary Court Judge to take

necessary actions to remove the wooden fence erected by him and the other obstructions stated in

the observation report.

Hence, we affirm the Order dated 18.09.2013 by the learned High Court Judge and dismiss this

appeal with costs fixed at Rs. 50,000/-.

Appeal dismissed.
