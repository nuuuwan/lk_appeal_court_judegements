WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Hambanthota

on the first count for committing the Murder of Mohommed Sidik Fauz

on or about 02.03.1987, an offence punishable under section 296 of

the Penal Code, and on the second count for attempting to commit the

murder of Mohammed Sidik Mohammed Arus by causing injuries by

shooting, an offence punishable under section 300 of the Penal Code.

After the trial, the learned High Court Judge convicted the appellant for

both counts, and imposed death sentence for the first count and

imposed a sentence of 05 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of

Rs.5000/- carrying a default sentence of 06 months simple

imprisonment for the second count by his judgment dated 11.01.2019.

This appeal is preferred against the said convictions and sentences.

In brief, the prosecution case is as follows:

On the day of the incident, around 7 p.m., the appellant and some

witnesses to the incident were drinking alcohol at the deceased's house

in Weerawila. Then, they got into a heated argument. The appellant

shouted at them in derogatory terms. After a while, the appellant left

and returned with a gun. The appellant fired the gun at PW-2, the

victim of the attempted murder, in front of PW-1's house, injuring his

left shoulder. PW-5 witnessed the accused-appellant shooting the

deceased Mohommed Sidik Fauz, the brother of PW-2, around 9.15

p.m.

The accused-appellant has given evidence under oath and stated that

he went with the deceased to load cattle on his request, and when he

realized that it was an illegal loading, he left the place and came to

Hambanthota. Accordingly, the appellant has taken an alibi, claiming

that he was not at the place where the crime occurred.

Both parties have tendered their written submissions, prior to the

hearing. At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel

for the appellant and the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the

respondent made oral submissions.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant advanced his

arguments on the following three grounds.

I. The identification of the accused-appellant as far as the death of

the deceased is concerned was not satisfactory.

II. No evidence has been led as to the identification of the dead body.

III. The learned trial Judge has concluded the guilt of the accused-

appellant prior to assessing the defence case.

First, I wish to deal with the third ground of appeal. Citing the judgment

of Ampagoda Liyanage Vijitha Mahindasena V. The Hon. Attorney

General- CA 163/2015 decided on 02.03.2017, the learned Presidents

4

Counsel contended that it is repugnant to law and against all principles

and norms to decide at the end of the prosecution case without

considering the evidence for the defence that the charges have been

proved against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The learned

Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) contended in reply that the learned

Judge, after hearing all the evidence in the case, has written the

judgment setting out the reasons for his finding. Therefore, the learned

DSG contended that the learned Judge has reached his conclusions

after evaluating the prosecution evidence as well as the defence

evidence.

The learned Presidents Counsel raised the aforesaid argument based

on the following observation of the learned High Court Judge:

.

Firstly, it is to be noted that the aforesaid Court of Appeal decision has

no binding effect to this court. It has only a persuasive value. However,

it is needless to say that the prosecution evidence as well as the defence

evidence has to be analyzed to decide whether a charge has been proved

beyond a reasonable doubt. In the case at hand, nowhere it is stated

before analyzing defence evidence, that the charges have been proved

beyond a reasonable doubt. In the aforesaid portion of the judgment,

what the learned judge stated was that when considering the

prosecution evidence, sufficient evidence had been adduced to prove

the first and second charges beyond a reasonable doubt. It appears that

the learned trial Judge was mindful that it is the duty of the prosecution

to adduce evidence to prove charges beyond a reasonable doubt.

Although, the prosecution adduces sufficient evidence to prove charges,

it should be considered whether the defence evidence casts reasonable

doubt on the prosecution case. Very correctly, the learned High Court

Judge has evaluated the defence case to see if the defence evidence cast

5

any reasonable doubt on the prosecution case. He rejected the

appellant's alibi for the reasons stated in the judgment (Next, in this

judgment, it has been considered whether the decision to reject the alibi

was correct), and only then did he decide that the charges have been

proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, it is apparent that the

learned trial Judge has not concluded the guilt of the appellant prior to

assessing the defence case. Hence, the third ground of appeal is devoid

of merit.

With regard to the defence of alibi, the learned Presidents Counsel

contended that the learned High Court Judge has made an erroneous

observation that the appellant did not state in his evidence in chief that

he had mentioned about the alibi in the statement he made while in

prison.

It is to be noted that presenting the alibi is a duty of the accused.

Section 126A (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act as amended by

the Act No. 14 of 2005, states as follows:

126A (1) - No person shall be entitled during a trial on indictment in the

High Court, to adduce evidence in support of the defence of an alibi,

unless he has-

(a) stated such fact to the police at the time of his making

his statement during the investigation; or

(b) stated such fact at any time during the preliminary inquiry; or

(c) raised such defence, after indictment has been served, with

notice to the Attorney-General at any time prior to fourteen days

of the date of commencement of the trial.

(Emphasis added)

The requirement (a) specified in the above section in taking the defence

of alibi may have prompted the learned Judge to make the aforesaid

observation. Anyhow, I agree with the contention of the learned

Presidents Counsel that if the appellant had not mentioned the alibi in

6

his statement, the learned State Counsel who prosecuted the High

Court case could have brought that matter to the notice of the court as

an omission when the appellant was cross-examined.

It should also be mentioned that when taking the defence of alibi, the

accused has no burden to establish any fact to any degree of probability

as decided in K.M. Punchi Banda V. The State 76 NLR 293. The

accused-appellant is entitled to be acquitted if his alibi casts reasonable

doubt on the prosecution case. The learned High Court Judge has

explained in his judgment the inconsistency between the defence

position taken up in cross-examining the prosecution witnesses and the

position taken up in the alibi. Especially, not mentioning the alibi to the

prosecution witnesses is a strong reason to reject the alibi. For these

two reasons, I hold that the learned High Court Judges decision to

reject the alibi is correct.

Now, I proceed to consider the second ground of appeal. The learned

Presidents Counsel for the appellant contended that the dead body has

not been identified, as none of the witnesses who identified the body

before the doctor was called in evidence. The learned DSG submitted

that the doctor who conducted the post-mortem examination proved

the identity of the deceased in his evidence.

The second ground of appeal that no evidence has been led as to the

identification of the dead body is incorrect. PW-6, the doctor who

conducted the post-mortem examination has given evidence regarding

the identification of the dead body. The only issue is whether the

doctors evidence is sufficient to prove the identity of the deceased. The

doctor stated the names of two persons who identified the deceased

before him prior to the post-mortem examination. No single question

has been asked from the doctor in cross-examination. Although two

witnesses who identified the deceased could not be called in evidence,

the aforesaid unchallenged evidence of the doctor establishes the

7

identity of the deceased without reasonable doubt. Therefore, the

second ground of appeal also fails.

Next, I proceed to consider the other main ground of appeal, the

identification of the accused-appellant. There were two incidents

pertaining to two charges; attempted murder and murder. The victim of

the attempted murder is the second prosecution witness of this case.

PW-5 has given evidence as the eyewitness to the murder. The main

contentions of the Learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant were

that there was no medical evidence to prove the attempted murder and

with regard to the murder, PW-5s identification in respect of the

shooter could not be accepted. The learned Deputy Solicitor General for

the respondent contended that although medical evidence is not

available, the attempted murder charge could be proved. Furthermore,

he contended that not only PW-5's testimony, but the other

circumstantial evidence of the case demonstrates that the appellant

and no one else shot at the deceased.

In proving an attempted murder charge, medical evidence helps to

establish the nature of the injuries. If an injury was caused by an act

such as stabbing, it should be proved by medical evidence that the

injury endangers the life of the victim to convict the accused for

attempted murder. However, in an incident of shooting, even without a

single injury, the charge of attempted murder could be proved because

the murderous intention of the shooter is clear when a gun is pointed

at the victim and the trigger is pulled. In the instant action, PW-2 has

stated in his evidence that he was injured as a result of the gunshot

and hospitalized. However, there is no medical evidence to prove those

injuries. As stated previously, what is required to establish the charge

of attempted murder is that the accused-appellant fired at PW-2.

According to the evidence of PW-2, it is apparent that he had no

difficulty in identifying the appellant because when he was in the yard

8

of the PW-1s house, the appellant came closer to him in front and

threatened not to move and shot at him. When PW-2 was cross-

examined about the way of identifying the appellant, he stated that he

saw the appellant's face in the moonlight. (Page 105 of the appeal brief).

Even PW-3 has testified that he heard the appellant came in front of

PW-1s house and threatened everybody to come out. PW-1 has also

stated that PW-2, the brother of the deceased was shot in front of his

house around 7.00 7.30 p.m. (Page 164 of the appeal brief). In

addition, PW-5 has stated that he heard a gunshot and then saw PW-2

falling on the ground near the stile (). Although there was no

medical evidence, it is apparent that the PW-2 was shot and injured.

Since the appellant came in front of PW-2 and shot at him, there is no

question about his identity, especially since they knew each other very

well. Hence, the attempted murder charge has been proved beyond a

reasonable doubt.

As the learned President's Counsel contended, the learned High Court

Judge relied on PW-5's evidence in determining the murder charge. The

learned President's Counsel contended that there was no sufficient light

for PW-5 to identify the appellant and that if the appellant was hiding

in a culvert and shooting at the deceased, PW-5 could not see the things

that he explained in evidence. Furthermore, the learned President's

Counsel pointed out that in the High Court, the distance between the

appellant and the deceased was mentioned as 15 feet, whereas in the

Magistrate's Court, a distance of 30 feet was mentioned.

However, during the re-examination, PW-5 has explained that he saw

the incident of shooting at a distance of 15 feet from the place where he

was and 30 feet is the distance from his house to the house of the

deceased. He explained further that the incident took place between his

house and the house of the deceased (Pages 226 and 227 of the appeal

brief). Therefore, there is no contradiction in respect of the distance.

9

According to the doctors evidence, the shooting could have taken place

from a distance of 3 to 10 feet. Therefore, when the PW-5 says that the

appellant shot at the deceased from a distance of about 15 feet, it tallies

with the doctors evidence. Also, the doctor has expressed his opinion

that, most probably, the person who shot the deceased was on the left

side of the deceased. He has also stated that it was possible that the

firearm was in a higher position than the position of the deceased.

PW-5s testimony about the place from which the appellant fired at the

deceased is also consistent with the expert opinion that the JMO

expressed as more probable because the appellant could have shot at

the deceased from his left when the appellant was hiding in the culvert

as described by PW-5. Hence, the eyewitnesss evidence has been

corroborated by the medical evidence.

With regard to the identification of the appellant, PW-5 has stated that

he clearly identified the appellant. Undoubtedly, they have known each

other since long before the incident, as transpired in the evidence. The

appellants house was situated in front of the house of PW-5. Hence, it

is apparent that there could not be any difficulty for PW-5 to identify

the appellant. As the land where the incident occurred was newly

allocated land, PW-5 stated that there were no trees on the land and he

could see the appellant clearly and identify him, although he was hiding

in a culvert. However, in explaining the identification, he stated that he

saw the shadow clearly ( ). Anyhow, no issue has

arisen on the identification of the appellant because all other

circumstances of the case establish that the appellant and no one else

shot the deceased as contended by the learned DSG. The appellant was

the only person armed with a firearm. It is apparent that there was no

possibility for a third person to come and shoot the deceased after

PW-2 was shot by the appellant a short while ago. Hence, it is clear

from the entirety of the evidence of the case that the appellant shot at

the deceased after his brother, PW-2, was shot. Therefore, not only the

eyewitnesss evidence but also the other circumstantial evidence invites

10

to come to the only inference of the guilt of the appellant for the offence

of murder as well.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant also raised an

argument that according to PW-2, when he was shot at the yard of PW-

1, his brother, the deceased was also there. Therefore, the learned

Presidents Counsel argued, if the appellant wanted to kill the deceased,

he could have shot him at that time. Therefore, he argued that

subsequent shooting while hiding in a culvert is improbable.

PW-2 has clearly stated that the appellant came there, threatened them,

pointed out the gun, and fired. PW-2 stated that he was injured due to

the said gunshot. His further evidence provides the answer to the

argument raised by the learned Presidents Counsel. When PW-2 fell

down due to the gunshot injury, his brother (the deceased) rushed

towards his house to bring water lamenting that his brother was shot

(page 93 of the appeal brief). Therefore, there was no opportunity to shot

at the deceased at that time. Thereafter, somehow PW-2 managed to

come to his house with his injuries. Then, he was taken to the hospital.

According to PW-5, he had seen PW-2 fell on the ground and thereafter

he went towards the road to see PW-2s brother, Fauz (sometimes called

as Fauci). Then he saw the appellant firing at the deceased as the

deceased was coming from PW-1s house. Therefore, it is apparent that

the appellant could not shoot at the deceased in the very short time that

he was with PW-2. After shooting PW-2, the appellant shot at the

deceased also, hiding in the culvert. Hence, there is no improbability

whatsoever in the prosecution story. Also, for the reasons stated above,

the accused-appellants identity has been established beyond a

reasonable doubt. Thus, I regret that I am unable to agree with the

contentions of the learned Presidents Counsel in relation to the first

ground of appeal, that the identity of the appellant was not satisfactory.

11

Accordingly, I find no reason to interfere with the judgment of the

learned High Court Judge. The judgment dated 11.01.2019, the

convictions, and the sentences are affirmed.

The appeal is dismissed.
