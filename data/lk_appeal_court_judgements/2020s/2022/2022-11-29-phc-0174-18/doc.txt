This is an appeal filed on 19.07.2018 against the judgment of the

learned High Court Judge of Uva Provincial High Court holden in

Monaragala in Case No. RA 53/2017 delivered on 10.07.2018 which

affirmed in revision, an order of confiscation of vehicle under the

Forest Ordinance delivered on 23.10.2017 by the learned Magistrate

CA-PHC-174-18 Page 3 of 8 29/11/2022 IJ-54-22

of Monaragala in case No. 82117. The petitioner has invoked the

appellate jurisdiction of this Court to set aside both orders and

thereby to release the confiscated Tractor bearing registration No.

SP (RA) 3601. In the petition the Appellant has only prayed for the

release of the tractor, thus this Court would not examine the validity

of the confiscation of the trailer.

On 24.05.2017, the tractor bearing registration No. SP RA 3601

(hereinafter the vehicle) and the trailer bearing No. UPRV 3102 were

taken into custody for entering a conserved forest and removing and

transporting sand in violation of the Forest Ordinance No. 16 of

1907. The accused persons who were one Nishantha who drove the

vehicle at the time and others, pleaded guilty, and a fine was

imposed. A vehicle inquiry was held under the Section 40 of Forest

Ordinance as amended in which the Registered Owner of the Tractor

(hereinafter referred to as appellant) gave evidence and was cross-

examined by the prosecution. The registered owner of the Trailer was

one Thilakaratne who had given the trailer to the appellant for a

monthly payment. After the conclusion of submissions, on

23.10.2017 the learned Magistrate ordered both the tractor and the

trailer to be confiscated. Aggrieved by the said decision, the

petitioner filed a revision application in the High Court, which

dismissed the revision application and reaffirmed the order of the

learned Magistrate.

Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance No. 16 of 1907 as amended by

Forest (Amendment) Act No 65 of 2009 stipulates confiscation of

vehicles connected with a forest offence as follows:

(1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence-

CA-PHC-174-18 Page 4 of 8 29/11/2022 IJ-54-22

(a) all timber or forest produce which is not the property

of the State in respect of which such offence has been

committed; and

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines

used in committing such offence

shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such

offence, be confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools,

vehicles, implements and machines used in the commission of

such offence, is a third party, no Order of Confiscation shall be

made if such owner proves to the satisfaction of the Court that

he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of such tools,

vehicles, implements, cattle and machines, as the case may be,

for the commission of the offence."(Emphasis added)

The Amendment of 2009 has cast a burden on a claimant of a vehicle

inquiry under the Forest Ordinance, on a balance of probability, to

dispense the burden of proving to the satisfaction of the Court that

he, having ownership of the vehicle concerned, had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of such vehicle for the commission of

the offence. Hence, the primary contention to be decided by this

Court is whether the learned Magistrate has correctly evaluated the

evidence placed before him when arriving at the final determination

that the appellant has failed to dispense the said burden.

It was contended by the appellant that the vehicle had been

purchased in 2011 and used to transport construction material on

hire. He had hired the driver one Samantha three months prior to

the incident. Appellant further contented that Samantha was known

to him from his own area, a frequent visitor to his house and the

CA-PHC-174-18 Page 5 of 8 29/11/2022 IJ-54-22

drivers license of Samantha was checked by him. He contended that

he had instructed not to engage in illegal activities using the vehicle

and to return it at the end of the day, furthermore at times when

time permits appellant visits the vehicle during work. He states that

on the day in question, he had given the vehicle for transportation

of bricks, and when he checked about it, he had been informed two

loads had been completed. In the afternoon on or about 2.00 pm

Samantha had informed the appellant that vehicle was taken into

custody for transportation of sand and that he had given the vehicle

to the accused as Samantha had got a toothache and visited a

dentist.

When perusing the evidence given by the appellant in the cross-

examination, it is noted that the appellant has not always been

aware of the hires of the vehicle.

CA-PHC-174-18 Page 6 of 8 29/11/2022 IJ-54-22

Therefore, it is revealed that there has been a practice of the driver

not informing the appellant and the appellant not asking the driver

about all the hires of the vehicle. At this juncture, the following

observation in Samarasinghe Dharmasena v W. P. Wanigasinghe

CA(PHC) 197/2013 CA Minute dated 22.01.2019 is applicable:

...it is well settled law that in a vehicle inquiry the claimant

has to discharge his burden on a balance of probability.

According to section 40 of the Forest Ordinance (as amended) it

is mandatory to prove on a balance of probability that the

owner took every possible precaution to prevent the vehicle

being used for an illegal activity.it is amply clear that simply

giving instructions to the driver is insufficient to discharge the

burden cast on a vehicle owner.

Therefore, merely giving instructions alone will not fall under

the possible preventive measures ought to be taken by a vehicle

owner (Emphasis added)

As held in S. D. N. Premasiri v Officer in Charge, Mawathagama

CA (PHC) 46/2015 Court of Appeal Minute dated 27.11.2018 it is

imperative to prove to the satisfaction of Court that the vehicle owner

in question has not only given instructions but also has taken every

possible step to implement them.

Thus, the law demands an active role on the part of the third party

claiming the vehicle confiscated for a forest offense, surpassing mere

verbal instructions. However as decided in Dewapurage Kamal

Deshapriya v Officer in Charge, Police Station of Pannala

CA/PHC/139/2015 by this same bench, the Act does not mean

that the owner of vehicle should sit beside the vehicle round the clock

and should control all the activities of the driver. The burden cast upon

CA-PHC-174-18 Page 7 of 8 29/11/2022 IJ-54-22

the owner is to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken

all precautions to prevent the use of such vehicle for the commission

of the offence.

This Court neither expects the owner to be in touch with the driver

back and forth every minute getting updated on miniscule details

nor the owner to be oblivious of important information such as who

has the control of his vehicle at a given point. In consideration of the

precautions taken by the appellant in the case at hand, this Court

is not satisfied that he has taken all possible measures to prevent

the offence. As aforementioned, there has been a practice of the

appellant not been informed of all the hires, been aware of some of

them at the end of the day once such hires were completed and the

driver seeking prior permission of the appellant at some instances

for the hires he took up. While the Court acknowledges there might

have been an emergency on the part of the driver on the day of the

incident, this practice seems to have contributed in driver not

informing the appellant when handing over the control of the vehicle

to another.

Furthermore, the learned Magistrate has relied on the fact that the

appellant signed as surety for two of the accused when they were

released on bail. The appellant submitted to this Court that he

signed as no one else was there known to them to sign and as they

were from the same village, whereas in the cross-examination the

appellant has stated he did not know the other persons accused

than one Nishantha. While this Court notes a contradiction in

stating not knowing the accused persons and then claiming they

were from same village, the lack of precautions taken by the

appellant in preventing the forest offense is adequate to affirm the

confiscation. Although the appellant has submitted that these

CA-PHC-174-18 Page 8 of 8 29/11/2022 IJ-54-22

actions occurred after the commission of the offense and do not fall

under precautions, such contradictions during the vehicle inquiry

depicts the insincerity of the claimant which can very well be taken

into consideration when confiscating the vehicle.

As this Court is not satisfied on a balance of probability that the

appellant has taken all precautions to prevent the commission of the

forest offense, it does not see any reason to intervene with the

confiscation order of the learned Magistrate in Case No. 82117 and

the judgment affirming the same delivered by the learned High Court

Judge of Uva Provincial High Court holden in Monaragala in Case

No. RA 53/2017.

Appeal dismissed.
