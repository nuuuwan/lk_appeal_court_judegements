JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General for committing the offence

as mentioned below.

On or about the 25th March 2012 in Madampe the accused-Appellant

committed the murder of Mudiyanselage Dishna Sobani which is an offence

punishable under Section 296 of Penal Code.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Chilaw as the Appellant

opted for a non-jury trial. The prosecution had led three witnesses and

marked production P1-4 and closed the case. The Learned High Court Judge

having satisfied that evidence presented by the prosecution warranted a case

to answer, called for the defence and explained the rights of the accused. The

Appellant gave evidence from witness box and called two witnesses on his

behalf.

After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High

Court Judge had convicted the Appellants as charged and sentenced him to

death on 29/11/2017.

3

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that

the Appellant has given his consent to argue this matter in his absence due

to the Covid 19 pandemic. At the hearing the Appellant was connected via

Zoom platform from prison.

In his solitary ground of appeal, the Learned Presidents Counsel contends

whether the Appellant should have been convicted for culpable homicide not

amounting to murder under Section 297 of the Penal Code.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

In this case no direct evidence is available but the case rests on

circumstantial evidence.

PW1 is the elder brother of the Appellant. This witness had confirmed that

his accused-brother had an affair with the deceased and were living together

in their ancestral home situated at Irattakulama at the time of her untimely

death. On the date of incident, while he was attending a Sramadhana at

Irattakulama, at about 4.00 p.m. the Appellant had given him a call and

asked him to come to his house. He had gone to the Appellants house

accompanied by his second brother by his motor bike. When they reached

there, the Appellant had requested the witness to bring a three-wheeler to

take the deceased to hospital as she was sick. This witness had sent his

second brother to bring his three-wheeler. At this time, the Appellant had

told this witness that he had fought with the deceased and therefore she had

fallen sick. This witness had not taken any endeavour to inspect the

condition of the deceased. When his brother brought the three-wheeler, the

Appellant went inside the house and informed that the deceased had refused

to come. Hence, he had gone home in his three-wheeler.

4

At about 6.30 p.m. when he returned home after a hire, he had met the

Appellant and the Appellant had told him that the deceased was not talking.

Hence, he had gone into the Appellants house and called the deceased but

she did not reply. As the Appellant had told him that the deceased seemed

to be dead, both had gone to the Madampe Police Station and lodged a

complaint.

According to PW5, the investigating officer, the first information about the

death was provided by the Appellant. Also, he had handed over a mobile

phone and the identity card of the deceased to PW5 who had arrested the

Appellant subsequently. Thereafter, he had gone for investigation visited the

scene of crime and recovered productions. The witness saw several sticks

including a broken broom stick in the house where the deceased lived with

the Appellant.

According to the JMO who held the post mortem, 110 injuries were noted on

the deceaseds body.

1. Head and Neck - 16 injuries.

2. Back of the Body - 10 injuries.

3. On the Chest - 10 injuries.

4. On the abdomen - 05 injuries.

5. On the Right Arm - 24 injuries.

6. On Left Arm - 15 injuries.

7. On Right Leg - 14 injuries.

8. On Left Leg - 11 injuries.

According to the JMO the number of injuries could be more as some cannot

be clearly identified. The summary of the injuries is mentioned below:

The injuries are in different ages; from few days to few hours.

The causative weapons are blunt; the patterns and the injuries are

consistent with those inflicted by poles, sticks, fist blows, forceful

5

grips, nail marks and being dashed hard on flat surfaces and a ridge

and vigorous shaking of the head.

The injuries had been repeated over the same anatomical parts in

different times.

The actual number of the injuries exceeds the injuries described as

some injuries show overlapping. The number of injuries exceed 110.

The front, back, and the flanks of the body show injuries due to being

assaulted from the all-possible directions.

There are injuries due to resistance and defence but the defence or

resistance is proportionately less compared to the total number of

injuries.

The injuries had been intensified with the time.

Some injuries could make the deceased incapacitated for some time.

The manifestation of the late injuries became less prominent due to

decreased volume of circulating blood due to obscured internal

haemorrhage in to soft tissues due to early injuries.

Injuries are fatal in ordinary cause of nature collectively in many

combinations due to hypovolaemia due to internal bleeding.

The Appellant had given evidence from witness box and called one of his

brothers and his mother as defence witnesses after the closure of the

prosecution case. The Appellant took up the position that he had constant

fight with the deceased but did not think the assault would lead to her death.

Although he tried to take her to the hospital with help of his brother PW1,

the deceased had refused. In the cross-examination, he took up the position

that he was not in good mental condition at the time of the incident. He

admitted that he had assaulted the deceased using sticks and also admitted

that he was a drug addict but had given up after releasing from the

rehabilitation camp.

6

Both the Appellants brother and the mother gave evidence to say that his

metal status was not rational during the period he had lived with the

deceased.

In the argument, the Learned Presidents Counsel strenuously stressed that

the Learned High Judge had failed to consider the circumstantial evidence

in its correct perceptively.

PW5, the investigating officer in his evidence clearly mentioned how he

recovered the productions from the Appellants house. Those items were not

introductions, as claimed by the defence. The items had been recovered

under his supervision by the crime investigation officers. He had identified

those production in the open court. The Learned High Court Judge had

considered this evidence in his judgment.

Next, the Learned Presidents Counsel contended that the Learned Trial

Judge has not considered the evidence of the JMO as to the wounds of the

deceased as they were quite old and the said wounds would not amount to

the cause death of the deceased. Hence, he stressed that this case is not one

that should have been considered under the third limb of Section 294 of the

Penal Code.

The Learned Presidents Counsel citied the Judgement of Vithana and

Others v. Republic of Sri Lanka [2007] 1 SLR 169 to substantiate his

argument. In that case Sisira de Abrew, J. held that:

(1) The intention that is contemplated in the 1st limb of Section 294 is

the intention to cause death which is commonly known as murderous

intention, but the intention that is contemplated in the 3rd limb of Section

294 is the intention to cause bodily injury. This injury should be

sufficient, in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The emphasis

here is on the sufficiency of the injury to cause death in the ordinary

cause of nature and not the intention.

7

In this case, the injuries sustained by the deceased play a decisive role in

determination of this case as to whether the Appellant had actuated the

murderous intention or not. Hence, the circumstantial evidence pertaining

to injuries found on the deceaseds body need to be discussed in detail.

PW10, Consultant JMO who examined the body clearly stated that there

were large number of injuries on the deceaseds body which were calculated

to be 110. He had opined that there could be even more injuries which had

been inflicted overlapping on existing injuries. These injuries were primarily

blunt force injuries. The patterns and the injuries are consistent with those

inflicted by poles, sticks, fist blows, forceful grips, nail marks and being

dashed hard on flat surfaces and a ridge and vigorous shaking of the head.

The injuries are in different ages; from few days to few hours.

According to the JMO, the death was caused due to multiple blunt force

injuries over few days and intensified on the date of death causing internal

bleeding, leading to Hypovolaemia, acute left ventricle failure and acute sub

dura haemorrhage. Lack of food was also noted in the Gastro Intestinal Tract.

The Pattern of blunt force injuries is in keeping with blows inflicted with

blunt weapons, dashing the deceased against hard surfaces and a ridge,

forceful grips, nail marks and vigorous shaking of the head.

The JMO further stated that the findings are consistent with that the

deceased had been subjected to cruelty and extreme violence including

(probably, not limited to) deprivation of food, and physical abuse. There is

medical evidence of exposure to unnatural acts of sex over period of time in

the past. (Deceaseds rectum is dilated)

PW10, in his evidence at page 82 of the brief stated although some injures

are not directly cause the death but other injuries inflicted on the deceaseds

body, especially on her head and internal injuries caused to her body which

led to Hypovolaemia condition had directly contributed to her death. The

relevant portion of the evidence of PW10 is re-produced below:

In this case, PW10 had detailed and given comprehensive evidence about

injuries found on the deceased and its causation to death. The deceased had

suffered injuries continuously without any medical treatment. She had been

9

starving and beaten mercilessly. She had willingly come to live with the

Appellant but the Appellant had totally neglected, tortured and assaulted her

without being seeking medical attention. She had died because of the

complication of the beating. Further, there was medical evidence that the

deceased was subjected to unnatural act of sex. The post mortem report

revealed that her rectum is dilated. The evidence transpired that all the time

relevant to this case the only occupiers of the Appellants house were the

deceased and the Appellant.

Considering all the circumstances, I find the Learned Trial Judge had very

correctly concluded that that the Appellant is guilty of committing the

murder of the deceased.

Finally, the Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant contended that

the Learned Trial Judge had failed to consider the mental condition of the

Appellant under the plea of Automatism to establish that the Appellants

performance of actions without conscious thought or intention.

The Appellant while giving evidence admitted that he was a drug addict and

was incarcerated for a longer period of time. But he admitted that he had

fully given up the habit while in the prison. Although he had consumed drugs

after his release, he had stopped after the deceased came to live with him.

The relevant portions of evidence are re-produced below:

In his re-examination the Appellant suddenly took up the position that in

the prison he was put among the insane persons. But he was not sure

whether he was treated for any mental disorder.

But the brother and the mother of the Appellant called for his defence gave

evidence with regard to some disturbed mental condition of the Appellant.

The Appellant giving evidence never complained of any mental disorder.

Further, the PW1 was never questioned about his metal condition. In the

cross examination, PW1 admitted that the Appellant was living without any

problem with the deceased during the period relevant this case. The relevant

portion of the evidence is re-produced below:

The Appellant never put his mental condition as his defence during the trial.

Only the defence witnesses had brought in to the trial.

In Gamini v. The Attorney General [1999] 1 SLR 321 the court held that:

The use of the criterion of external physical factors and internal

physical factors to distinguish between plea of automatism and

insanity is wholly incongruous in the law of Sri Lanka. Our law is

that in a plea of automatism the accused must lay a sufficient

foundation for his plea by leading evidence that his mind was not

controlling his limits at all at the time of the commission of the

offence. It is not sufficient for the accused to lay the foundation

and discharge his evidential burden by establishing that his mind

was acting imperfectly at that time, if he was still reacting to

stimuli and controlling his limbs in a purposive way. In such an

event he would fail to lay a sufficient foundation for the plea of

automatism. He must establish that his acts were wholly

conclusive and not purposive in any manner.

Considering case for the defence, it is crystal clear that the Appellant had

not laid a sufficient foundation for the plea of Automatism. This clearly shows

his afterthought to escape from this case. Hence, the ground raised by the

Appellant has no merit at all.

As discussed under the appeal ground advanced by the Appellant, the

prosecution had adduced strong and incriminating circumstantial evidence

against the Appellant. The Learned High Court Judge had very correctly

analyzed all the evidence presented by both parties and had come to a

conclusion that all the circumstances are consistent only with the hypothesis

of the guilt of the Appellant and totally inconsistent with his innocence.

12

As the Learned High Court Judge had rightly convicted the Appellant for the

charge levelled against him in the indictment, I affirm the conviction and

dismiss the Appeal of the Appellant.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Chilaw along with the original case record.
