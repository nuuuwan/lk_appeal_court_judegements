ARGUED ON : 20/09/2022

DECIDED ON : 27/10/2022

R. Gurusinghe, J.

The accused-appellant (the appellant) was indicted in the High Court of

Colombo for being in possession and trafficking of 82 grams and 43 milligrams

of heroin, offences punishable under Section 54A of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

After trial, the appellant was convicted of both counts and sentenced to life

imprisonment. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the

appellant preferred this appeal to this court.

When this matter was taken up for hearing, counsel for the appellant mainly

relied on two grounds of appeal.

3

1. The evidence of the prosecution witnesses failed the test of credibility and

test of probability.

2. The learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the evidence given

by the appellant and failed to give reasons for the rejection of the dock

statement made by the appellant.

Prosecution version

PW4 Police Constable 6485 Mataraarachchi received information at 4.35 a.m.

on the 10th of April 2013 that Niranjan (the appellant), who was earlier residing

at Ferguson Road, (now living in Batagama North) was dealing with narcotics

on a large scale. It was further informed that he was coming to the Mahawatte

clock tower in the morning, which is situated at the Colombo-Negombo Road.

The informant said that he could show him (the appellant) and asked the

officers to come to Ingurukade junction.

PW 1 sub-inspector Handunnetti arranged a raid consisted of 8 officers. Both

PW1 and PW4, after meeting the informant at the Ingurukade junction,

proceeded to Mahawatte junction with the informant. They arrived at

Mahawatte Junction at 6.10 a.m. They were on the pavement near the clock

tower, facing towards the direction of Peliyagoda. The appellant came in a

three-wheeler at 6.25 a.m. After taking the roundabout, he stopped the three-

wheeler passing the Mahawatte Junction, facing towards Peliyagoda. The

appellant got down from the three-wheeler with a black-coloured plastic bag

and looked around. Then PW1 and PW4 went to him and introduced

themselves as police officers from the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB). When the

bag was checked, they found heroin inside the bag. The appellant was arrested

at 6.35 a.m. After that, the police team went with the appellant to his house,

which was located in Batagama North and searched the house. They did not

find anything illegal in the house. They returned to the PNB at 10.00 a.m. The

heroin was sealed and handed over to PW2.

Defence version

The appellant made a dock statement and stated that while he was sleeping, he

heard someone was knocking on the door in the early morning hours. When

the appellant asked who it was, they first said that it was a friend of the

appellant, and later on they said that they were from the police. When the

appellant opened the door, the police asked him for heroin, and the appellant

was severely assaulted. The appellant was arrested at around 6.30 a.m. and

the police took the three-wheeler which was parked at the yard of the appellant

into their custody, along with some documents. The police officers had

breakfast at St. Anthonys Restaurant in Wattala. In his dock statement, the

appellant said that he was brought to the PNB and was introduced heroin.

Afterwards, he was produced before the Maligakanda Magistrates Court and

the appellants Attorney-atlaw informed the Magistrate that the appellant was

arrested at his residence and introduced heroin. The position of the defence

was put to the prosecution witnesses.

The informant had given information to PW1 at 4.35 a.m., on the 10th of April

2013. On page 51, PW1 describes the information that he received from the

informant.

It gives a detailed description; the name of the appellant, the registration

number, the colour of the three-wheeler and the place where the appellant was

supposed to come early morning. The description of the information was

unbelievably detailed and precise. The question arises as to whether it is

possible for an informant to know exactly that the appellant would bring heroin

in the early hours of the morning, that is at 4.35 a.m.to Mahawatte junction or

even earlier unless he got to know about it from the appellant himself or unless

the informant had been with the appellant during that time. It is highly

impossible to believe that a drug trafficker would ever divulge his mission in

detail to somebody else. It is impossible that a reasonable man would ever

think that an informant receives such precise information in the wee hours of

the day and therefore, the truthfulness of receiving the information is doubtful.

The police team left the PNB at 5.15 a.m. in a vehicle. Within half an hour,

they were able to reach Ingurukade Junction. PW1, the main investigation

officer and PW4, got down from the cab and met the informant near the Damro

showroom. The informant had told them as follows:

.

Then they headed towards Mahawatte junction which was located about 150

meters away from the Ingurukade junction. As per the evidence of PW1, they

took 20 minutes to go that distance. They arrived at the Mahawatte junction by

6.10 a.m. and they waited near the clock tower, on the left side of the road

expecting the appellants arrival.

It seems that the appellant never wasted the time of the prosecution witnesses.

He came to that place within 10 15 minutes. The appellant took the

roundabout at the clock tower and stopped the three-wheeler, passing the

Mahawatta junction. After that, he stepped onto the pavement.

The informant pointed out the three-wheeler, the number and the colour of

which was already made known to PW1 and PW4 and when the person in the

three-wheeler got down, the informant said;

.

It is difficult to believe the fact that the informant waited until the appellant got

down from the three-wheeler and that he described the clothes the appellant

was wearing. If the appellant was the only person who came in the three-

wheeler and if the informant knew exactly that it was the appellant who came

in the three-wheeler bearing number 207-3461 (Pages 51 and 55), a question

arises as to why he waited to describe the appellants clothes when he provided

the police with information which was sufficient to do a proper investigation.

Therefore, this additional piece of evidence regarding the appellants attire is

difficult to believe.

The position of PW1 here is that, the informant did not wait until the three-

wheeler stopped. This position is completely different to what has been

described by this same witness earlier and this is also contradictory to the

evidence of PW4 on the same point. This is an obvious contradiction on a

material point which goes to the root of the prosecution case.

At pages 174, and 175, PW4 answered as follows:

The position of PW4 is also that the informant stayed with them until the

three-wheeler stopped and the appellant stepped on to the pavement. The

description given by the informant at this moment is also unbelievably long

and descriptive. It seems that the descriptions are more fictional than real

testimony.

The position of PW1 is that the accused got down from the three-wheeler and

went onto the pavement and had not moved or turned to their side until such

time they went close to him. When PW1 introduced himself to the appellant,

11

the appellant tried to get into the three-wheeler. Then, PW1 and PW4 dragged

him out of the three-wheeler.

However, the position of PW4 was that after getting down from the three-

wheeler the appellant came towards them.

It is very clear that the position of PW4 was that, the appellant got down from

the three-wheeler and came towards them. But the position of PW1 is that the

appellant got down and stayed at that place. These two positions are clearly

contradictory to each other regarding the arrest of the appellant.

At page 62 PW1 said that they dragged the appellant out of the three-wheeler.

This was not possible if the appellant came towards PW1 and PW4.

15

At page 230, PW4 said that the appellant tried to go towards the three-wheeler

when they showed him their identity cards. However, the appellant could not

go to the three-wheeler as PW4 stayed behind him.

This piece of evidence is contradictory to the evidence of PW1. These

contradictions create a reasonable doubt as to the manner in which the

prosecution described the arrest of the appellant. The position of the defence

was that the appellant was arrested at his residence and introduced heroin at

the PNB. The evidence of PW1 and PW4 was challenged and the position of the

defence was suggested to PW1 and PW4.

The position of the defence was consistent throughout the trial. The appellant

was produced before the Maligakanda Magistrate Court on 12th of April 2012

and remanded in custody. On the 24th of April 2013, an Attorney-at-law

appeared for the appellant and stated to the Magistrate that the appellant was

arrested at his residence and not when he was travelling in his three-wheeler

and also stated that the report of the PNB was false. The Magistrate Courts

record is attached as a part of the proceedings.

The learned Trial Judge has not paid attention to the fact that there were

glaring contradictions per se in the evidence of PW1 and contradictions

between the testimony of PW1 and PW4.

The Trial Judge had not mentioned nor had he considered the facts the

appellant stated to the Magistrates Court. The learned Trial Judge had not

stated whether he accepts or rejects the dock statement of the appellant. If the

dock statement was rejected, the reasons for such rejections should be

reflected in the judgment. The dock statement of the appellant is not a mere

denial. He explained his position. The defence position is not an afterthought.

It has been the position adopted by the appellant from the date an Attorney-at-

law first represented him at the Magistrates court. The position of the defence

was duly suggested to the prosecution witnesses. The learned Trial Judge has

not evaluated the defence evidence at all. This amounts to a denial of a fair

trial.

The contradictions and improbabilities in the evidence of the prosecution and

the evidence of the appellant create a reasonable doubt in the prosecution

case.

For the foregoing reasons, I set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed

on the appellant.

The appellant is acquitted.

Appeal allowed.
