Prosecution version

Upon receiving information from a private informant, PW1 Police Inspector

Vipula Nandana Wimalasiri, who was an investigator at the Police Narcotics

Bureau (the PNB), left the PNB along with nine other officers on the 16th of

January 2007. The police team consisted of Sub-Inspector Sampath, Woman

Police Sergeant Shama,(PW9), PC 50149 Sanath, PC 13158 Niroshan, PC

12784 Weerasinghe, PC 33158 Wickramasinghe(PW6), PC 33295 Asoka, PC

14868 Somasiri, and PC driver 34644.

All officers were in civilian clothes. They came to Borella and parked their

vehicle near the Cycle Bazaar at Borella at about 11.00 a.m. and waited there

till 12.15 p.m. They came to Colombo Fort and then proceeded to the

Ratmalana railway station. They reached the Ratmalana railway station at

14.05 and had lunch at a nearby restaurant. After lunch, they left for the PNB.

On their way, PW6 PC33158 Wickramasinghe received a telephone call from a

private informant at 15.44. As per his information, the informant was near the

Dehiwela railway station and wanted them to meet him soon. They came near

the railway station in Dehiwela at 16.15. PW1 and PW6 went to meet the

informant. The informant said that a woman would be coming from the

direction of Galle Road towards the railway station, between 4.00 and 5.00

p.m. The informant said that he could show her to the police. The police team

was stationed near a Christian church at 4.30 p.m.

PW1, PW6, PW9,the woman police sergeant Shama and the informant stayed

near the church at 4.30 p.m. At 4.40 p.m., a woman came from the direction

of the Dehiwela junction, who was clad in a pink-coloured blouse and a pink,

yellow and grey mixed long skirt. The informant showed the woman, about 100

meters away, to the police and left the place. PW1 stopped the woman when

she approached towards them and introduced them as officers of the PNB.

4

PW1 instructed the van to be taken to that place. As the van was with tinted

privacy glasses, the inside of the vehicle was not visible to the outside. The

woman was taken into the van. PW9 searched the woman and found a

polythene bag wrapped in a womens handkerchief. As per PW9, it was in

between the breasts of the woman (the appellant). PW1 took the parcel and

identified the substance that was inside the bag as heroin, and the appellant

was arrested at 16.55. They returned to the PNB at 18.05. The substance was

weighed by an electronic weighing scale, and the weight of the heroin was

22grams and 300milligrams. The heroin was duly sealed by 7.00 p.m. The

heroin was kept in a private locker of PW1, and the keys were with him. The

heroin was handed over to the Reserve Police Officer on the following day at

2.00 p.m. The heroin was sent to the Government Analyst, and the report

confirmed that there was 5.4 grams of heroin.

The appellants position is that on the 16th of January 2016, in the evening,

when she was coming from the Dehiwela market after buying vegetables and

some provisions, a woman she called Shiromi Akka was there with some people

and showed the appellant to them. Then PW1 came to her and introduced

them as the officers from the PNB. IP Nandana told her that they had received

information that she was engaged in Narcotics trafficking. She was then taken

into the van which was parked nearby. There were no lady police officers in

the police team. She only had her handbag; inside the bag was a mobile

phone, some cash and another provision bag. The police questioned her and

took her to the PNB. At the PNB, PW1 asked a lady police officer to check the

appellants bags. The woman police officer searched the bag and said that

there was a parcel inside the bag. The appellant told them that when they

checked the bag at the time of the arrest, there was no such parcel in the bag.

The police officers had abused her in filthy language and forced her to put her

thumb impression on an envelope. The woman who showed the appellant to

the police was a known person to the appellant. She is known as Shiromi Akka

from whom the appellant had taken a loan on interest. The appellant was not

5

able to repay it as agreed. There was an exchange of words about the

repayment of the loan between Shirom Akka and the appellant. Shiromi Akka

then told the appellant that she would teach her a good lesson. The appellant

stated that she did not possess heroin. There was no single lady police officer,

nor was there heroin found in her bag that was searched by the police team at

the time of her arrest. At the PNB, the police officers had falsely charged her,

saying that there was a parcel of heroin in her handbag. The lady officer was

seen for the first time when IP Nandana asked her to search the appellants

bag.

The grounds of appeal urged by the appellant are as follows:

1. The indictment was amended after two witnesses had completed their

evidence. The amendment was not read out to the appellant, nor it was

handed over to her. This is an imperative provision as per the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act. Further, the learned High Court Judge signed

the amendment in the indictment. That is not a function of the Judge,

and that should have been done by an officer from the Attorney Generals

Department.

2. The second ground of appeal is that the learned High Court Judge has

failed to take into account the contradictions of the testimonies of the

prosecution witnesses per-se and inter-se.

3. The learned High Court Judge had decided that the prosecution had

proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, before considering the defence

witnesses.

4. The dock statement of the appellant was rejected without adequately

evaluating it.

6

The appellant concedes the fact that she was arrested near the railway station

at Dehiwela and then taken to the PNB. There are two main differences

between the prosecution version and the defence version. The defence position

is that the appellant did not have heroin in her possession, and there was no

female officer at the time of her arrest.

I will first consider the prosecution case and the defence case, comparing the

evidence of both parties.

As per the prosecution, PW9 WPS404 Shama did the physical search of the

appellant inside the van at the place of arrest. The evidence of PW9 was

mainly confined to what had been recorded in the information book. Some of

the answers given by PW9 raised a doubt about her participation in the raid. At

pages 147, and 148 of the original case record, PW9 has answered as follows:

The prosecuting counsel dropped that line of questioning at that time.

It is also strange that they were kept inside a vehicle for more than one hour

without getting down or doing anything. After that, they went back to Pettah

and then they went to Ratmalana along the Galle Road, without going to the

PNB. If they were to go to Dehiwela, they could have gone straight away to

Bambalapitiya and then to Ratmalana without going back to Pettah.

This is the evidence from a person who claims to have been waiting in the van

for more than one hour from 11.10 a.m. The Cycle Bazaar is on the left side of

the Baseline Road, if you go from the direction of Dematagoda to Borella.

10

From that place the Borella junction and the Super Market building can be

seen. A question arises as to why did the police officers refer to this place. I

think it is a prominent place and well known to the police officers. This is an

officer who served for 26 years at the Colombo PNB. It is not reasonable to

believe that PW9 does not know the Baseline Road. This is probably an

attempt not to contradict with other witnesses, not knowing what they had

stated about the road. If she waited for more than one hour on the Baseline

Road, she must have known that it was the Baseline Road.

However, the evidence of the appellant was that she had a handbag and inside

her handbag, there was her mobile phone and also, she had a vegetable bag.

record.

PW9 is the person who claimed to have searched the appellant at the time of

her arrest. If PW9 had seen the appellant coming from a distance of 100 meters

and waited until she approached them, how come PW9 had never seen the

handbag in her hand or any other bag? As per the evidence, only PW1, PW6

and PW9 were together. The first thing they should have done was to check her

handbag before searching between her breasts. PW9 had not even seen a bag.

PW1 or PW6 did not say that they checked the appellants bag.

The cumulative effect of the unsatisfactory nature of the above answers,

creates a doubt in her testimony. In the case of Wijeratne v Republic of Sri

Lanka,78 NLR 49, it was stated as follows:

When the accused was facing a capital charge it was essential that every point

in favour of the accused, though it may seem trivial, should be placed before

the Jury. It may well be that all such matters if so placed before the Jury may

create a reasonable doubt the benefit of which the accused is entitled to. When

however, the circumstances against the accused are emphasized and the Trial

Judge expresses his opinion as to the adverse inferences that could be drawn

from the circumstances and fails to place the circumstances and inferences in

favour of the accused before the Jury, the accused is deprived of the substance

of a fair trial.

This witness narrates only what has been written down in the notes. She could

not answer to any question asked, in addition to what was recorded in the

notes. Regarding the payments for lunch, PW1 stated that each person paid

for their lunch. PW6 said that PW1 had paid for all of them. PW9 says that

she has not recorded it and cannot remember. As per their notes, they have

done nothing at Borella. Nothing has been recorded with regard to the

investigation done at Borella.

Considering the above infirmities and contradictions, the prosecution version

cannot be believed beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence of PW9 is crucial in

deciding the liability of the appellant as she was the only lady police officer to

join the raid and the only person who could search the appellant to find out

whether she possessed anything illegal. However, the evidence of PW9 creates a

serious doubt about her participation in the raid. The analysis of the learned

High Court Judge has not gone into the infirmities and contradictions of the

prosecution evidence, which makes the prosecution story doubtful.

14

Considering the aforementioned infirmities and contradictions, it is not

prudent and safe to send an accused person to the gallows. She has been in

the prison for 7 years now.

As the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, I will

not consider the rest of the grounds of appeal.

For the foregoing reasons, I set aside the convictions and the sentence imposed

on the appellant.

The appellant is acquitted.

Appeal allowed.
