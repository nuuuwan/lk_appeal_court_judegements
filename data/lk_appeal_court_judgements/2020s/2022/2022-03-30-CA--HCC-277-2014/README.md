R. Gurusinghe, J.

The Accused-Appellant (the appellant) was indicted in the High Court of

Polonnaruwa for committing the murder of a person by the name of D.M.

Damayanthi Senehelatha on or about the 19th of March 2006, and on the same

day, in the same course of the transaction, committing the attempted murder

of a person by the name of M.G. Anulawathie, which are offences punishable

in terms of Section 296 and 300 of the Penal Code respectively.

After Trial, the Learned High Court Judge found the appellant guilty of the two

charges and sentenced him to death for the first count, and a term of five years

rigorous imprisonment for the second count.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the appellant preferred

this appeal.

3

The grounds of appeal set forth by the appellant are as follows:

1) The Learned Trial Judge erred in law by failing to consider, that it is

unsafe to convict the appellant by relying on the voice identification.

2) The Learned High Court Judge has erred in holding that PW1 was a

hostile witness to the prosecution, where the prosecution had not made

any such application in terms of section 154 of the Evidence Ordinance.

3) PW4 was threatened by the prosecutor when she was giving evidence.

4) The Learned Trial Judge erred in holding that the evidence of PW1 was

corroborated by the short history given to the doctor.

Since PW1 is the wife of the appellant, the Learned Trial Judge had noted that

the evidence given by her would be considered only with regard to count two.

PW1 stated in her evidence that her vision had been completely impaired since

2003. On the 19th of March 2006, PW1 had stayed the night at her sons

house. While she was sleeping with her daughter-in-law and three

grandchildren, someone had opened the door, entered the house, and attacked

her and the daughter-in-law. The witnesses position is that she was not able

to recognize the attacker because of her poor vision. She had later got to know

that her daughter-in-law had been killed by the person who had attacked her,

and the daughter-in-law.

PW 1 had been taken to the hospital with head injuries.

PW2 Janaka Lakshan is the son of the deceased and was seven years old at the

time of the incident. As per his evidence, he was sleeping with his mother,

grandmother, and sisters on the day of the incident. When he was asleep, he

4

heard his grandfathers voice (the appellant) asking them to open the door and

shouting Sakuni Sakuni. At that moment, his mother, the deceased, had

closed Sakunis mouth and remained silent without opening the door. Then the

appellant broke opened the door and entered the house. He thereafter, had cut

the neck of the mother of PW2 with a knife which had a long handle and had

attacked his grandmother too. PW2 had also stated that there was a very dim

lamp. He had identified his grandfather, (the appellant), by his voice. He had

also recognized the appellant in court. PW9, the doctor, in giving evidence,

stated that he had examined PW1 and had not noticed any impairment of her

vision, as she had walked into his room without any assistance. He had also

stated that there were two cut injuries on PW1; one above her right eye and

the other on her head. He further testified that those injuries could have been

caused by the weapon shown to him, marked as P1.

According to the evidence given by PW4, Padma Damayanthi (the appellants

daughter), the appellant had visited her around 8.00p.m. on the day of the

incident. She further stated that the appellant had asked her to take care of

her mother. On being questioned as to why he said so, the appellant replied

that, I attacked your mother. ( ). Her brother had later

informed her over the phone that her sister-in-law had been killed.

The police discovered the knife produced as P1, from an irrigation canal,

followed by the information received from the appellant. The doctor who

conducted the autopsy also gave evidence and produced the post-mortem

report, The police officers who conducted the investigation also gave evidence.

The appellant gave a very short dock statement denying the allegation against

him.

5

The first ground of appeal is that it is not safe to act on the evidence of PW2, as

he had identified the appellant only by the voice

In this case, the appellant was the grandfather of PW2 and PW 2 stated as

Identification of the assailant by the voice cannot be excluded as unsafe. As

per illustration (b) of the Evidence Ordinance that a man heard or saw

something is a fact. It is not possible for the court to disregard the testimony

of a witness, on the ground that he had not visually identified the assailant.

However, the court has to be mindful that the identification by the voice alone

is a weak piece of evidence.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamys book The Law of Evidence Volume 1 page 257,

says as follows:

Identification of accused by voice

Some witnesses purport to identify a person by his voice. It is not safe to rely on

such identification and the liability to error is great. This is particularly for when

the identification was at night. But when the accused was intimately known to

the witnesses who identify him by his voice and gait, the Supreme Court of India

decline to hold that identification was unsafe. In South Africa voice identification

parades have been held with dubious results

7

In this case, PW1 had the opportunity to be familiar with the voice of his

grandfather very often. Besides, the voice identification is not the only

evidence against the appellant. After careful consideration of all the facts, if

the court is satisfied with the identification of a person by the voice alone,

there is no reason to prevent its acceptance on the basis of conviction.

In the case of Dalbir Singh vs State Of Haryana decided on 15 May 2008

the Supreme court of India (Indian Kanoon.org/doc/817642) stated as follows:

He had categorically also stated that from the voice of accused who raised the

lalkara he recognized the assailant as his grandson. The stand of the appellant

that in dark night recognition would not have been possible from voice is

clearly untenable. In a dark night, ocular identification may be difficult in some

cases but if a person is acquainted and closely related to another, from the

manner of speech, gait and voice identification is possible

Likewise, in this case, relying on the fact that the appellant is a close relative of

PW2 and PW2 had the opportunity to hear the appellants voice very often, we

can conclude that the voice identification is possible and it provides no reason

to believe that the identification is not accurate.

As per the evidence of the appellants daughter (PW4), the appellant had visited

her house at around 8.00 p.m. and stated that he had attacked the mother.

In State of Rajasthan v. Raja Ram [(2003) 8 SCC 180], it was held by the Supreme Court of India

An extra-judicial confession, if voluntary and true and made in a fit state of

mind, can be relied upon by the court. The confession will have to be proved

like any other fact.

PW4 being the daughter of the appellant, she had no animosity towards him.

In fact, she tried to avoid giving answers that were detrimental to the appellant.

However, the above evidence of PW4 clearly fits into the evidence of PW1 and

PW2. The doctors evidence also supports the version of PW2.

The place from where the weapon was recovered by the police, consequent to

the statement of the appellant is a unique place. The appellant stated that

. .

The appellant had shown the police the place where the weapon had been

thrown. But initially, the police was unable to recover the weapon from the

canal of the reservoir as the water level was twenty feet high. Thereafter, with

the assistance of the irrigation officials, the sluice gates were closed and the

water level was reduced the next day. Only then that the police was able to

recover the weapon. It would not have been possible for the police to find the

weapon in such a place if the appellant had not shown the place.

The doctor was of the opinion that the injuries on the deceased body could

have inflicted with the weapon marked as P1, which was recovered by the

police as stated above.

The Learned High Court Judge had stated that he had not considered the

evidence of PW1 against the appellant, with regard to the charge of murder, as

per the provisions of Section 120 of the Evidence Ordinance.

PW 1 stated that she had been assaulted by the assailant at the incident and

hospitalized with the cut injuries. PW2 in his testimony stated that the

appellant had assaulted both, his mother the deceased, and his grandmother

PW1. Moreover, PW4 in giving evidence said that her father had stated to her

10

that he attacked the mother and asked her to take care of the mother. The

doctor testified that PW1 had two grievous cut injuries on the head and the

skull was also damaged. Eventhough PW1 did not divulge the name of the

assailant, the above evidence sufficiently prove that the appellant had attacked

PW1. When considering the gravity and the place of the injuries, we can come

to a conclusion that he had the intention to kill her. Thus, the evidence is

sufficient to justify the second count.

In the above circumstance, the Learned High Court Judge has used only

legally admissible evidence to convict the appellant.

The next argument is that the Learned High Court Judge has held that, PW1

was a hostile witness to the prosecution, whereas the prosecution had not

made an application under section 154 of the Evidence Ordinance to do so.

The term hostile or adverse witness is not found in that section. In terms of

section 154 of the Evidence Ordinance, the court may permit the person who

calls a witness to ask any questions, can also be asked by the adverse party.

PW1 had clearly omitted to state all she had stated to the doctor and stated it

in the Magistrates Court. The Learned High Court Judge has only observed

that PW1 had given evidence detrimental to the prosecution. The Learned High

Court Judge has not used such observations to bolster the prosecution case.

The argument that PW4 was threatened by the prosecutor does not manifest in

the proceedings. The evidence of PW4 is consistent, though she has omitted a

considerable part of what she had stated to the police and to the Magistrates

Court, which was not favourable to the defence. She has not added anything

new in the High Court. No single contradiction is marked. It is true that she

naturally tried to give answers favouring her father, the appellant. This

argument cannot be sustained.

11

The next argument is that the Learned High Court Judge had not accepted or

rejected the dock statement of the appellant. The Learned High Court Judge

has referred explicitly to the dock statement on pages 14 and 15 of the

Judgment. He has decided that the dock statement had not created a

reasonable doubt in the prosecution case. The dock statement is a very short

statement and a mere denial. The High Court Judge has rejected that

evidence.

This argument, therefore, has no merit.

For the reasons stated above, the appeal of the appellant is dismissed.
