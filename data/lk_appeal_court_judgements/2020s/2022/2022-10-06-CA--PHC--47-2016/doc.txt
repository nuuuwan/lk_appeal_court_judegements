Order

This is an appeal emanating from an Order made by the learned High Court Judge of

Ratnapura on 25.04.2016 dismissing the revision application filed against the Order dated

01.06.2010 made by the learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge in

case bearing No. 41280 of Magistrates Court, Pelmadulla.

It appears that the Officer-in-Charge of Police station Kahawatta had filed an information

on 18.12.2009 in terms of Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979

stating that there is a dispute between the 1st Party and the 2nd Party in respect of the

land described in the said information, where a breach of the peace is threatened or is

likely to be threatened.

In relation to the complaint lodged on 20.11.2009 by the 1st Party-Respondent, his house

had been collapsed 1 months ago due to flooding and as a result of it, he had to settle

at his mothers place. Thus, the 1st Party-Respondent had vacated the possession of the

land 1 months before the information was filed.

However, it was contended by the 2nd Party-Respondent that the 1st Party-Respondent

being dispossessed 1 months prior to lodging their complaint at the Police Station is

false. Since the information was filed in terms of Section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act and it relates to a question of dispossession, it is seen that Section 68 (1)

and (3) are applicable in this instance.

Having followed the procedure stipulated under Section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act and after the conclusion of the inquiry, the learned Magistrate had made

an Order on 01.06.2010 and held that the 1st Party to the said action should be granted

possession of the property in dispute and further prohibited the 2nd Party from committing

acts which would interfere with the possessory rights of the 1st Party.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, 2nd Party-Petitioner had invoked the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa holden at Ratnapura seeking to

set aside or revise the said Order of the learned Magistrate and to have reliefs prayed by

the 2nd Party-Petitioner granted.

At the inquiry before the learned High Court Judge, having considered the preliminary

objections and other contentions made by the 1st Party-Respondents, the learned High

Court Judge delivered his Order on 25.04.2016 dismissing the revision application on the

ground that there was no sufficient ground to set aside or revise the Order of the learned

Magistrate of Pelmadulla.

Being aggrieved by the said Order dated 25.04.2016, the 2nd Party-Petitioner-Appellant

has preferred this appeal to this Court seeking to set aside the said Order and to have the

reliefs prayed in his affidavit dated 15.02.2010 granted to the 2nd Party-Petitioner-

Appellant [hereinafter referred to as the Appellant]

It is settled Law that invoking revisionary jurisdiction of Court is confined to cases in

which exceptional circumstances exist warranting its intervention. Since, exercising

revisionary jurisdiction is a discretionary remedy to grant relief, the party concerned has

to establish not only that the impugned order challenged is illegal, but also that the nature

of the illegality is such, it shocks the conscience of Court.

It appears that the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of

Sabaragamuwa held that the 2nd Party-Respondent had not shown the impugned Order of

the learned Magistrate is not illegal and that no exceptional circumstances exist to revise

the Order.

It is observable that the learned Magistrate having considered the information filed by

the Police, their observation notes and the complaints and the statements made to the

Police by the 1st Party-Respondent and the 2nd Party-Respondent, had come to the correct

conclusion that there was no dispossession of the 1st Party-Respondent from the premises

in dispute 2 months prior to the date on which information was filed.

Moreover, the learned Magistrate had considered the supporting affidavits given by the

people living in that area and established that the 1st Party-Respondent had to vacate the

premises in dispute which he had been in possession for well over 20 years due to floods

Page 5 of 5

caused by the overflowing of the canal adjacent to the disputed premises. This position

was substantiated by document 17 given by the Grama Niladhari in that division.

Therefore, the learned Magistrate had come to the correct finding of fact that the 1st

Party- Respondent was in possession of the disputed premises 2 months prior to the date

of filing of information and that he was not dispossessed from the premises in dispute. As

such, it is apparent that no miscarriage of justice or any injustice was caused to the 2nd

Party-Petitioner-Appellant by the Order dated 01.06.2010 made by the learned

Magistrate.

Hence, we see no reason for us to interfere with the Order of the learned Magistrate

dated 01.06.2010 and the Order made by the learned High Court Judge on 25.04.2016.

Thus, the appeal of the 2nd Party-Petitioner-Appellant is dismissed with costs fixed at

25,000/-.
