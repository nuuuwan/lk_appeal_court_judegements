Judgment

The Plaintiff instituted action bearing No.11653/L in the District Court of Galle, against the

Defendant inter alia seeking the following reliefs;

A declaration of title to the land and premises called Makandugoda Kurunduwatta

more fully described in the schedule to the plaint

To eject the Defendant from the said land and premises.

For damages and other costs.

The Plaintiff had stated in the plaint that he is the owner of the subject matter of the

instant action and further stated that the Defendant had come to possession of the subject

matter with the consent and the approval of the previous owners, the predecessors in title.

The Defendant had taken up the position in his answer that he was in possession of the land

in dispute for more than 10 years and pleaded a prescriptive title over the subject matter.

At the conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge of Galle pronounced the Judgment

in favour of the Plaintiff.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment, the Defendant-Appellant had preferred this Appeal

seeking to have the said Judgment set aside and sought a declaration that he is entitled to

a prescriptive title over the subject matter.

Since the instant action is an action for Rei Vindicatio, the burden of proof squarely and

fairly rests upon the Plaintiff to prove his title to the subject matter of the action. It was

the contention of the Defendant-Appellant that the Plaintiff-Respondent had failed to prove

his title and properly identify the corpus. Thus, sought a dismissal of the action.

It is evident that Plaintiff had purchased the impugned subject matter by Deed of Transfer

bearing No.3554 dated 20.05.1981 marked as P3 from Leelawathie Weerasena and

Chandrawathie Weerasena. They had derived title to the subject matter Lot 7 and 8 from

the final partition decree (P1) of partition action bearing No. P/1335. Furthermore, the

predecessors of the Plaintiff had enjoyed the fruits and benefits of the premises in dispute

and the Defendant-Appellant was merely permitted to look after the premises in dispute as

a licensee.

In view of the Final Partition Decree (P1) in partition action bearing No. P/1335 and the

Deed of Transfer bearing No.3554 dated 20.05.1981, Plaintiff has clearly established his title

to the subject matter of the instant action.

Therefore, it is the burden of the Defendant-Appellant to prove that he had acquired a

prescriptive title to the subject land in terms of Section 03 of the Prescription Ordinance.

Section 03 of the Prescription Ordinance states that any Defendant to plead prescription

should have proof of undisturbed and uninterrupted possession by a title adverse to or

independent of the Plaintiff for ten years prior to the institution of the action. In terms of

Section 03 of the Prescription Ordinance, if any one accepts that the subject matter of the

action is someone elses and he is in possession with permission and/or approval (leave and

licensee) of the owners, the title of the subject matter wont be adverse.

In this respect, Court observes the cross examination of the Defendant-Appellant in the

instant case. In cross examination, the Defendant-Appellant states;

- ? - - ? - . - ? - . - ? - . - ? - . - 18.08.1981 ? - . According to the said evidence, the Defendant-Appellant was in possession of the subject

land with consent and approval of the previous owners, the predecessors in title of the

Page 4 of 4

Plaintiff-Respondent namely Leelawathie Weerasena and Chandrawathie Weerasena with

the mere expectation of getting the subject land and premises in issue.

In the case Navaratne Vs. Jayatunge 44 NLR 51, Howard, CJ. expressed that the Defendant

entered into possession of the land in dispute with the consent and permission of the owner.

Being a licensee, she cannot get rid of this character unless she does some overt act showing

an intention to possess adversely.

It is apparent that in the instant case, the Defendant-Appellant was a mere licensee and

was in possession of the subject land with leave and license of the predecessors in title of

the Plaintiff-Respondent. Thus, possession of the Defendant-Appellant, however much

exclusive or long continued, will not amount to an adverse possession.

As such, in terms of Section 03 of the Prescription Ordinance, the Defendant-Appellant had

not proved his adverse possession of the land and premises in suit. It is worthy to note that

according to the evidence placed before Court, Defendant-Appellant had failed to prove the

undisturbed and uninterrupted possession of the subject matter for more than ten years

adversely.

Thus, it is observable that the Defendant-Appellant had not proved the necessary

ingredients in terms of Section 03 of the Prescription Ordinance to acquire prescriptive title

over the subject matter of the instant action.

However, the Plaintiff-Respondent had proved his title to the subject land. Thus, it is seen

that the learned District Judge has come to the correct findings of fact and law and decided

the instant case in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent and dismissed the prescriptive claim

of the Defendant-Appellant.

Hence, the Judgment of the learned District Judge is well founded. Thus, we see no reason

to interfere with the same.

As such, the appeal is dismissed with cost.

Appeal dismissed.
