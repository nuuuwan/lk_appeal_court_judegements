This is an application for revision filed to revise an order of the High Court

of Homagama dated 08.11.2021 which refused to enlarge the suspect on

bail under the Poison Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act No 13 of 1984. On

08.12.2020 suspect was arrested under the Act and produced before the

Magistrate Court of Kesbewa on 09.12.2020 upon which he was

remanded. Thus, the suspect has been in remand custody for nearly 1

year and 5 months. The Government Analyst report was issued on

25.03.2021 wherein the pure quantity of heroin has been identified as

35.26g.

B report filed in the Magistrate Court which prompted the incarceration of

the suspect does not disclose from where the alleged substance was found

in the suspects person. But during the bail inquiry before the High Court,

the learned High Court Judge has called a report from the Excise

Department and in it, it has been disclosed that the substance was

retrieved from the suspects trouser pockets. The petition contends that

neither the B report nor any further reports submitted against the suspect

reveal any indication as to how the suspect concealed heroin. During oral

submissions, the counsel for the petitioner contended this omission cast

a serious doubt as to whether the suspect had exclusive possession of the

PHC-APN-1-22 Page 3 of 5 16/06/2022 IJ-27-22

alleged substance and thereby contending that there was no material

before the Magistrate to satisfy the incarceration of the suspect. The

petition further submits that although the High Court has found that

excise officers defaulted in reporting where heroin was concealed in the

suspects person, the High Court has failed to consider such fact as an

exceptional circumstance. It is the contention of the petition that such fact

amounts to an exceptional circumstance warranting the revision of the

High Court order dated 08.11.2021 to enlarge the suspect on bail.

Upon a perusal of the brief, it is evident that at the time of ordering the

suspect to be remanded, there was no material before Court delineating

the specific place from which heroin was recovered from the suspect. Such

an instance is provided for in Section 114 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No 15 of 1979 (as amended) (hereinafter the CPC) as If upon

an investigation under this Chapter it appears to the officer in charge of the

police station or the inquire that there is not sufficient evidence or reasonable

ground of suspicion to justify the forwarding of the accused to a Magistrate's

Court, such officer or inquirer shall if such person is in custody release him

on his executing a bond with or without sureties as such officer or inquirer

may direct to appear if and when so required before a Magistrate's Court

having jurisdiction to try or inquire into the offence. In the same light,

reference can be made to Section 116 of the CPC which provides for the

duty of officer or inquirer to forward case to a Magistrate's Court if

sufficient information is well founded. Hence, both Section 114 and 116 of

the CPC dictate that a person cannot be deprived of liberty unless for good

reason. These sections along with Sections 115, 120 (1), (2), (3) enable

judicial scrutiny and control over any investigation. This is a power given

to the judiciary to supervise the progress of the investigation with a view

to ensuring that once a suspect is remanded, the suspect would not

continue to remain in custody in the absence of sufficient and important

materials. These provisions are laid out to ensure that all suspects are

treated with fairness during investigations since everyone is presumed

PHC-APN-1-22 Page 4 of 5 16/06/2022 IJ-27-22

innocent until proven guilty. At this juncture, I would like to echo an

observation made by His Lordship Justice Fernando in Victor Ivon v

Sarath N. Silva (1988) 1 SLR 340: A citizen is entitled to a proper

investigation one which is fair, competent, timely and appropriate of a

criminal complaint, whether it be by him or against him. The criminal law

exists for the protection of his rights of person, property and reputation

and lack of a due investigation will deprive him of the protection of law

It is pertinent to refer to Udumulla Kankanamalage Sumathipala v

Attorney General CA/PHC/APN 9/2010 CA Minute dated 19.07.2010

delivered by His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew. In the said case, the

suspect was arrested for being in possession of 50 g of heroin and in the

B report filed by the police, the police failed to state the particular place

(the body of the suspect) where heroin was found although they claimed

that heroin was found in the possession of the suspect. Among other facts

considered by the Court, the period of incarceration, the absence of an

indictment led to the conclusion of releasing the suspect o bail.

The omission by the excise officers to specifically delineate where heroin is

found in the suspects person is a grave situation that must be given due

judicial regard. Based on such deficient evidence the suspect has been

languishing in prison since 09.12.2020. The counsel for the respondent

asserted that the suspect has previous conviction for possession of

3,700mg of heroin and was convicted and sentenced on 17.06.2010 in

Magistrate Court of Mt Lavinia Case No B 4687/07 wherein a fine of Rs.

10,000/- was imposed. Apart from the said submission, the respondent

failed to give any indication as to when an indictment would be forwarded

against the suspect.

Therefore, in the instant matter in view of all the material stated above this

Court is of the opinion that the learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider the above-mentioned material in the impugned order which

1998

PHC-APN-1-22 Page 5 of 5 16/06/2022 IJ-27-22

makes it an exceptional circumstance to set aside the said order dated

08.11.2021 and enlarge the above-mentioned suspect on bail.

Hence, the instant application for revision is allowed and this Court directs

the learned High Court Judge of Homagama to enlarge the above-

mentioned suspect on appropriate conditions of bail.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to dispatch a copy of this order to

the High Court of Homagama, forthwith.

Application allowed.
