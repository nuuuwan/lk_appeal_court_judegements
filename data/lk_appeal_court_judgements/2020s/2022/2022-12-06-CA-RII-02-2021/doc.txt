B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Plaintiff-Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff), by

Petition dated 1st February 2021, is seeking to invoke this Courts revisionary and/or

restitutionary jurisdiction in terms of Article 138 of the Constitution to set aside the Order

of the District Court of Walasmulla dated 9th January 2019 (P16) and the Order of the

High Court of Civil Appeals holden at Tangalle dated 10th September 2020 (P17) and for

this matter to be tried de novo. The other parties to this matter did not participate in the

proceedings, although notice had been issued to them by the Fiscal.

The Plaintiff, in this case, made an application to the District Court in terms of

Section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code on the basis that the judgment of the District

Court dated 3rd July 2008 (P7) was incorrect, due to an accidental slip or omission in

excluding two Lots from the corpus. The District Court refused the application. Following

Page 5 of 10

this, the Plaintiff appealed to the Civil Appellate Court which also dismissed the

application.

The Plaintiffs main grievance is that the Orders of the District Court and the Civil

Appellate Court are made per incuriam and in a manner prejudicial to his property rights.

Both Courts refused the Plaintiffs application made in terms of Section 189 of the Civil

Procedure Code to correct the purported accidental slips or omissions by amending the

judgment, final plan, and final decree in the substantive partition action.

We will set out the facts prior to determining whether the Plaintiff is entitled to

the relief prayed for. These reliefs prayed for are as follows:

a. To issue notices to the Respondents,

b. To Hear this application,

c. Acting in revision and/or restitutio in integrum to set-aside order dated 09.01.2019 of the

Learned District Judge of Walasmulla and the Judgment dated 10.09.2020 of the Learned

High Court Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court of Tangalle.

d. Send the case back to trial de-novo before the District Court of Walasmulla.

e. Grant costs, and

f. Any such further reliefs as Your Lordships Court shall seem meet.

The factual background is as follows. The Plaintiff instituted a partition action in

the District Court of Walasmulla by Plaint dated 5th September 2001 (P1) to partition a

land called Mahasiyambalawewatta. Mr. H.P.P. Jayawardena, Licensed Surveyor,

prepared a preliminary plan (No. 3892 dated 7th December 2003 P2) consisting of ten

Lots marked A to J. In his report (P3), it was recommended that Lots G, H, and

I be excluded from the corpus since those Lots were respectively, a Pradeshiya Sabha

road, a stream reservation, and not belonging to the corpus. The parties filed their

statements of claim. The matter proceeded to trial with the recording of five admissions.

No issues were raised. The admissions recorded on 19th March 2008 (P5) were as follows:

01. , , .

02. ,, ,, .

03. 2,4 .

05. .

Thus, the parties agreed that Lots G, H, and I would be excluded from the

corpus (which was admitted to include only Lots A, B, C, F and J) and that a

common road on the southern boundary of the corpus would be granted, instead of the

roads that were used by the 2nd and 4th Defendants depicted as Lots D and E. It was

only the Plaintiff that gave evidence. He was not cross-examined. The matter was fixed

for judgment as the Defendants did not wish to give evidence. The judgment was delivered

on 3rd July 2008 (P7) and, consequently, the interlocutory decree was entered. Mr.

Jayawardena prepared the final plan No. 4793 dated 28th October 2008 and thereafter the

final decree was entered. The Plaintiff contends that he was unable to properly execute

the writ owing to some mistakes found in the said judgment and the final plan.

Therefore, he filed a motion in terms of Section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code,

which was supported on 3rd October 2018, to correct the purported mistakes. These

mistakes included, among other things, that the learned Trial Judge erred in holding that

the corpus contained only Lots A, B, C, F and J when the corpus should have

included Lots D and E as well and that Lots D and E were erroneously treated as

a common road and therefore excluded. However, the learned District Judge by the

impugned Order dated 9th January 2019 (P16) dismissed the application. The learned

District Judge observed that the Plaintiff himself had admitted that the corpus consisted

of Lots A, B, C, F and J, which he reiterated in his evidence too. Further, the

application did not concern mistakes which were merely accidental slips or omissions

rather the amendment sought was fundamental and went to the root of the matter. The

relevant parts of the Order read:

Aggrieved by this Order the Plaintiff filed a leave to appeal application in the Civil

Appellate Court, holden at Tangalle. Leave was granted. However, the learned Judges

ultimately dismissed the appeal, by impugned Order dated 10th September 2020 (P17).

The learned Judges were of the view that the Plaintiff had admitted that the corpus

contains Lots A, B, C, F and J. Nevertheless, the decision of the learned Trial

Judge to exclude Lots D and E although erroneous, was not an accidental slip or

omission falling within the ambit of Section 189. It was deliberate. The learned Judges

concluded that the remedy sought should have been by way of an appeal or restitution

and not an application under Section 189. The relevant parts of the Order read:

On a perusal of the record, it appears that the learned Trial Judge erred when he

excluded Lots D and E from the corpus. Those Lots should have formed part of the

corpus as well. The Plaintiffs conduct is not irreproachable either. As the learned District

Judge correctly identified, it was by the parties own admission the corpus was said to

consist of Lots A, B, C, F and J. No attempt was made to correct this during the

course of giving evidence either. This is a mistake on the Plaintiffs part, which he admits

in Paragraph 5 of the Petition as well.

Nevertheless, we are mindful of the settled law that an imperative duty is cast on

a trial judge to investigate the title and to carefully examine and analyse the totality of

the evidence placed before him or her. To that effect, the learned District Judges aforesaid

Order is wrong.

It must be noted that the present case is not to impugn the admissions recorded

by the parties own volition, which the law permits to do so only if it is an admission of

law, and not an admission of fact. This application deals with the allegation of breach of

the imperative duty cast on the trial judge to go beyond the recorded admissions and

investigate the title and correctly identify the corpus.

We are now tasked with determining whether this mistake is one that falls within

the ambit of Section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code and whether the learned Judges were

correct in their findings that it did not fall within the ambit of Section 189.

Section 189(1) of the Civil Procedure Code reads:

The court may at any time, either on its own motion or on that of any of the parties, correct any

clerical or arithmetical mistake in any judgment or order or any error arising therein from any

accidental slip or omission, or may make any amendment which is necessary to bring a decree into

conformity with the judgment.

This Section was analysed in the case of Mohamed Iqbal v. Mohamed Sally [1995]

2 SLR 310. His Lordship Ranaraja J. (with his Lordship S.N. Silva J. (as he then was)

agreeing) observed thus:

Section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code permits Court on its own motion or on an

application by any of the parties to an action;

(1) to correct any clerical or arithmetical mistake in any judgment or order,

(2) to correct any error arising in any judgment or order from any accidental slip or omission,

(3) to make any amendment which is necessary to bring a decree into conformity with the

judgment.

Section 189 is exhaustive of the causes for which a decree may be amended.

We are of the view that the learned Judges of the District Court and the Civil

Appellate Court were correct in their views that the type of mistake that is sought to be

rectified in the present application is not one falling within the ambit of Section 189. It

appears to be conscious and deliberate. A matter such as the redistribution of the shares,

which arises now with the inclusion of two new Lots (and as explained below an exclusion

of one Lot i.e. Lot J from the corpus) unlike, for example, an arithmetic mistake in the

share allocation, cannot be treated as falling within one of the three limbs set out in

Mohamed Iqbal (supra). We cannot stretch the parameters of Section 189 to include the

present mistake within its ambit, even if there appears to be an injustice, and thereby

cause ambiguity in this area of law, when there are clear avenues that can be taken such

as an application for revision to revise the judgment of the learned Trial Judge dated 3rd

July 2008 and the consequent orders thereon.

Further, the Plaintiff has not prayed for the setting aside of the judgment dated

3rd July 2008 (P7), instead, the prayers, as set out above, deal with setting aside the

Orders concerning the application under Section 189 and for the matter to be reheard

afresh so that the District Judge can re-determine whether the mistake falls within the

sphere of Section 189. Even in his leave to appeal Petition to the Civil Appellate Court (on

page 10 of the Brief) there was no prayer to set aside the judgment dated 3rd July 2008.

There too it was only to set aside the Order dated 9th January 2019 of the District Court.

Page 10 of 10

In Surangi v. Rodrigo [2003] 3 SLR 35 his Lordship Gamini Amaratunga J.

observed:

No Court is entitled or has jurisdiction to grant reliefs to a party which are not

prayed for in the prayer of the plaint.

It must also be noted that in his written submissions, although not raised in the

Petition, the Plaintiff has alleged that the learned Trial Judge had included Lot J in the

corpus when it should not form part of the corpus. The Surveyors Report (P3) notes that

Lot J does not belong to the corpus. This also fortifies our view that the mistakes alleged

are not those falling within the ambit of Section 189. In this application, we are concerned

with examining whether the learned Judges were right or wrong in determining whether

the mistakes alleged fell within the ambit of Section 189. We cannot conflate the two in

order to do justice as there are more suitable avenues and remedies available. This is not

a case where there is no other remedy.

For these reasons, the application is dismissed. This dismissal must not be

construed as a bar to the Plaintiff to file an application for revision if so advised.
