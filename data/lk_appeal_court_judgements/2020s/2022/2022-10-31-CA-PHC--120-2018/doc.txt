This is an appeal filed by the 1st applicant-respondent-appellant

(hereinafter the appellant). The appellant impugns the order dated

29.06.2018, delivered by the Provincial High Court of the Western Province

holden in Negombo, which acted in revision and affirmed the vehicle

confiscation order dated 25.11.2011, delivered by the learned Magistrate

of Wattala under the ambit of Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance. The

appellant has preferred this instant appeal to this Court in order to set

aside both the orders dated 29.06.2018, delivered by the High Court and

the order dated 25.11.2011, delivered by the Magistrate Court and thereby

to disallow the confiscation of the vehicle bearing the registration number

WPLE 5652.

The facts of the case are briefly as follows. The Magistrate Court of Wattala

framed charges against the accused for committing an offence under

Section 40, read with Sections 24 and 25 of the Forest Ordinance, as

amended by, inter alia, Act no.65 of 2009 (hereinafter Act), where the

accused has illegally transported sawn timber worth of Rs. 43, 905.55, by

employing the said vehicle in question. The accused pleaded guilty for the

said charge on 25.03.2011, upon which the accused was convicted for the

said offence by the learned Magistrate. The conviction of the accused

ensued an inquiry by the learned Magistrate, to show cause as to why the

vehicle in question should not be confiscated, pursuant to which the

appellant or the registered owner of the vehicle and the 2nd Applicant-

Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter Respondent) or the absolute owner of

the vehicle, submitted evidence before the Magistrate Court.

In concluding the evidence submitted, the learned Magistrate ordered the

vehicle to be confiscated for want of precautionary measures on the part

of the owner of the vehicle as per the law set out in the Act.

CA-PHC-120-18 Page 5 of 7 31/10/2022 IJ-47-22

Aggrieved by the said decision, the appellant filed a revision application in

the High Court of Negombo, which reaffirmed the order of the learned

Magistrate. Hence the appellant has preferred the instant appeal to the

Court of Appeal to set aside the order dated 25.11.2011, delivered by the

Magistrate Court and the order dated 29.06.2018 delivered by the High

Court.

Prior to the perusal of the merits of this application, the law relevant to

this application can be set out in the following manner.

Section 40 of the Act stipulates that where any person is convicted of a

forest offence, the tools or the vehicle used in committing such an offence

shall be confiscated by an order of the convicting Magistrate. However, the

proviso to the section provides that, if the owner of such vehicle is a third

party, no order of confiscation of the vehicle shall be made if such owner

proves to the satisfaction of the court that he has taken precautionary

measures to prevent the commission of such an offence.

Therefore, as per the law set out in the Act, it is apparent that the onus

falls on the owner of a vehicle to prove on a balance of probability, that

s/he has taken sufficient precautionary measures to prevent the use of

his vehicle to commit such an offence. It is an indispensable burden cast

on the owner of a vehicle to prove that s/he has acted responsibly with

regards to the use of his vehicle, where he has taken necessary precautions

to prevent the commission of such an offence.

Hence, this Court primarily looks in to the contention of whether the

learned Magistrate has correctly applied the legal provisions and evaluated

the evidence presented before the court in arriving at the final

determination that the appellant has failed to dispense the said burden to

the satisfaction of the court.

The evidence presented before the court, revealed that the owner of the

vehicle has not wielded proper authority over the use of the vehicle for the

key of the vehicle has been in the possession of the mother of the appellant

CA-PHC-120-18 Page 6 of 7 31/10/2022 IJ-47-22

at the time the accused took the vehicle out on the said excursion (212 of

the Appeal Brief). This shows that the appellant has not been in proper

control of her vehicle and that her lackadaisical attitude towards the use

of her vehicle allowed the vehicle to be used by any person, even without

the express consent of the vehicle owner. Therefore, it is the view of this

Court that the appellant has not properly discharged the burden cast on

her to prove to the satisfaction of the court that she has taken necessary

precautionary measures to prevent the commission of such an offence.

As held in S. D. N. Premasiri v Officer In Charge, Mawathagama C A

(PHC) 46/2015 Court of Appeal Minute dated 27.11.2018 it is

imperative to prove to the satisfaction of Court that the vehicle owner in

question has not only given instructions but also has taken every possible

step to implement them.

However, in the instant application, the appellant has not taken any such

precautionary measures to ensure the proper employment of the vehicle

without being subjected to the commission of such offences.

Furthermore, as revealed by the journal entry dated 18.11.2011 of the

order dated 25.11.2011 delivered by the Magistrate Court, the absolute

owner of the vehicle at the time of the inquiry was not the Kaluthota

Financial Services Limited, the respondent of the instant application, it

was the Mercantile Investment Company who was the absolute owner, and

they did not claim ownership over the vehicle. Therefore, the evidence

submitted by the respondent in this application is immaterial as they are

not the absolute owner of the vehicle at the time of the inquiry.

As per the law set out in Section 40 of the Act, the owner of a vehicle must

prove on a balance of probability that he has taken necessary

precautionary measures to prevent an offence and thus, merely giving

instructions or the lack of knowledge of the diversion of the vehicle does

not suffice to prove to the satisfaction of the court that he has taken

precautionary measures to prevent such an offence.

CA-PHC-120-18 Page 7 of 7 31/10/2022 IJ-47-22

Therefore, due to the failure of the appellant to prove on a balance of

probability, the prevalence of precautionary measures, to the satisfaction

of the Court, thereby failing to dispense the burden cast on the owner of a

vehicle, this Court is of the view that there is no irregularity or illegality in

the order delivered by the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court

judge has correctly dismissed the revision application. Accordingly, we see

no reason to interfere with the order of the learned High Court Judge dated

29.06.2018 and the confiscation order of the learned Magistrate dated

25.11.2011.

The appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
