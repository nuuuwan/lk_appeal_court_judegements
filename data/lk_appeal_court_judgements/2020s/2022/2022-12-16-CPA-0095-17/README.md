This is a revisionary application filed on 14.07.2017 by the State to set

aside the order of the learned High Court Judge of Badulla in Case No.

HC/65/2014 dated 02.11.2016, to stay the order of learned Magistrate of

Badulla in case No. 73847 dated 03.07.2017 and to call and examine the

records of both the aforementioned cases.

The facts of the case are as follows. On 30.12.2013 the Officer-in-Charge

of Badulla (hereinafter referred to as Petitioner) made a complaint against

the Accused-Appellants-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as

Respondents) under section 5 of the Animals Act as amended by Act No.

46 of 1988 and under section 4 (1) of the said Act as amended by Act No.

10 0f 2009 to be read with section 3(a) and 3(d) of the said Act for the

offense of illegal transportation of two heads of cattle without a lawful

permit, in a cruel manner. Respondents (Accused) pleaded not guilty and

thereafter were convicted with a fine by the learned Magistrate of Badulla.

Aggrieved by the said order, the respondents appealed to the HC of Badulla

where they were acquitted on 02.11.2016 and consequent to such order

the MC Badulla in the order dated 03.07.2017 directed to handover the

cattle to the respondents.

The petitioner has submitted to this Court that the ownership of the cattle

has not been established in any of the courts mentioned above and the

learned Magistrate has made the order without a disposal inquiry in terms

of section 425 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 as

amended (hereinafter referred to as CCP). The contention that has placed

before this Court is to ascertain whether the criminal courts can make a

decision upon their discretion without such inquiry when disposing

property under section 425. The content of this section is as follows:

425 (1) When an inquiry or trial in any criminal court is

concluded the court may make such order as it thinks fit for

the disposal of any document or other property produced

before it regarding which any offence appears to have been

CA-PHC- 95-17 Page 5 of 7 16/12/2022 IJ-61-22

committed or which has been used for the commission of any

offence. (Emphasis added).

Subsection (4) to section 425 defines property to include such property as

has been originally in the possession of any party or property converted or

exchanged and anything acquired by such conversion or exchange.

From the wordings of the provision, it is evident that the legislature has

placed its trust in the judiciary to determine the disposal of the property

under section 425. The learned ASG appearing for the petitioners relied on

decided case law on this subject in support of his contention.

In the case of Meegahapola Vs OIC Harbour Police and Another it is

decided that:

An acquittal from a charge of possession of 25 radio cassettes does not

entitle the accused to receive the productions as the police took them from

him. Under Section 425(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the court

after inquiry must make such order as it thinks fit in regard to the disposal

of the productions. The claimant should have satisfied court that he was the

real owner of the productions in court. Instead by relying on his acquittal

and not adducing evidence after raising a preliminary objection, he left the

Magistrate with no alternative but to confiscate the productions.

Furthermore, in Jayagoda & Another v. Attorney General (2006) 2 Sri

L.R. 387, it was held that:

At the conclusion of a trial when an accused is acquitted, a court may not

always find whether an offence was committed. What the court finds out is

whether the accused had committed a crime. There may be numerous

occasions where although crimes are committed no charges are successfully

brought against anyone. It may be that the accused are not known or that

the evidence is not sufficient or that the witnesses cannot be traced. A court

will not just go in to the question whether a crime had been committed

against a person or property unless there is a person who can be held

responsible. Even if a particular accused could not be found guilty, it does

CA-PHC- 95-17 Page 6 of 7 16/12/2022 IJ-61-22

not mean that a crime had not been committed. That may be the reason why

courts are given authority to dispose of property when it appears to court

that an offence has been committed in respect of any property. When the

court finds that there is no evidence to prove a charge, there is no rule that

the property against which an offence appears to have been committed

should be returned to the person from whom it was taken.

Therefore, such discretion is granted to the Court not to dispose

productions related to an offence without any reasoning, but to provide

judges further opportunity to prevail justice in instances such as failure

to dispense the burden of proof where there is a prima facie case.

Therefore, holding a disposal inquiry is not a hindrance to the discretion

of court but rather provides a pre-requisite in arriving at a just decision.

Basnayake J. in Jayagoda & another v. Attorney General (supra)

further provided an example on this matter where he stated;

If that is the case criminals could obtain the maximum benefit by

eliminating all the evidence against them. To illustrate this point if, for

example, X robbed a bank and hid the loot but one day got caught and

showed the police where the loot was, admitting to the police that he robbed

the bank and what was shown was part of the loot, and yet got an acquittal

due to lack of evidence, should the court return the money to X to be taken

away? This is the reason why the law empowers court to make such order

as it thinks fit for the disposal of property produced before it.

In the case at hand, at no point in the course of the proceedings the

ownership of the cattle has been proven to be of the respondents.

In Thirunayagam v. IP Jaffna 74 NLR 163 it was held that,

I am in agreement with the view that it is open to a Magistrate, where

special circumstances exist, to order property to be delivered to a person

other than the person from whose possession it was seized. Therefore, it

is not right before the eyes of the law to dispose the cattle to the

respondents without any disposal inquiry merely because the respondents

were acquitted in appeal.

CA-PHC- 95-17 Page 7 of 7 16/12/2022 IJ-61-22

At the argument stage learned ASG did not pursue to set aside the order

of acquittal by the High Court of Badulla in order No. HC/65/2014,

therefore this Court would not examine the said HC order or make any

determination on that matter.

This Court sets aside the order made by the Magistrate Court of Badulla

in Case No. 73847 dated 03.07.2017 disposing the productions of the

matter to the respondents. The Magistrate of Badulla is ordered to hold a

disposal inquiry pertaining to this application according to the law set

out herein.

Application partly allowed.
