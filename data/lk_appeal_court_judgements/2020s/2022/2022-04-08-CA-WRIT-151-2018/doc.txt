The facts of the case are briefly as follows, the Petitioner in 1965 became the owner of a paddyland by the name of Elhenpitiya Kumbura situated at Gammana, Pothuhera, in the KurunegalaDistrict. There were two pillewas adjacent and annexed to the said paddy land ElhenpitiyaKumbura,, to which the Petitioner became entitled to by virtue of paternal inheritance. In orabout 2012 the Petitioner had got a survey done and executed a deed of declaration confirminginteralia the said paternal inheritance.

2

The Petitioner states that as a result of official duties and her transfer to Colombo, she was not ina position to visit the said agricultural lands frequently and used hired labour to have the saidpaddy land cultivated. One such person engaged by the Petitioner as hired labour was A. MAriyadasa. The said person and his wife Lalitha Kumari were said to be owners of the paddyland immediately adjacent to the Petitioners said Elhenpitiya Kumbura on the South and South-West.

The Petitioner states that to access Elhenpitiya Kumbura and her said Pillewa from the publicroad one had to get onto a stretch of land depicted as Lot 1 in plan bearing 9399 which waspurchased by the Petitioner in 2013 from the previous owner. The Petitioner states that inFebruary 2015, the Petitioner came to know that the said Ariyadasas wife, had some yearspreviously illegally filled up a portion of the said Hendiweldeniya Kumbura in the aforesaid tractof fields and had constructed an unauthorized house thereon. The Petitioner states that later in orabout February 2015, the said Ariyadasa and his wife Lalitha Kumari had transferred title to thesaid Hendiweldeniya Kumbura to one Anoma Kumari Ratnamala. Thereafter the said AnomaKumari Ratnamala had gifted the said Hendiweldeniya Kumbura to the 5th Respondent and thatthe fence that was separating the Petitioners pillewa from Lot 1 had been removed by the 5th

Respondent who is now the current owner.

The Petitioner further states that by letter dated 06/04/2015 [PX3(A)] this action of the 5th

Respondent had been brought to the attention of the 1st Respondent which was also copied to the2nd Respondent. By this letter, their attention was drawn to the use of the said pillewa for non-agricultural purposes as a motorable gravel road, to gain access to the said unauthorized house,and also the possibility of infringement of her rights as the owner cultivator. By the letter dated08/06/2015 (PX 8) the Petitioner had informed the 3rd Respondent that she was not complainingagainst the 5th Respondent but is seeking a clarification pertaining to the filling and constructionof the roadway and whether it had been done with the approval of the 3rd Respondent. In reply,the 3rd Respondent by letter dated 12/06/2015 (PX 9) had informed that after a site inspection ithad been found among other things that the use of the gravel road constructed over the saidpillewa has become an obstruction to the Petitioners cultivation rights.

The Petitioner filed this writ application and prays for the following relief:

(1) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus on any one or more of

the 1st 4th Respondents compelling them to perform, in the aforesaid circumstances,the public duty contemplated by Section 32 (1) (5) in the official version of the said Actand or by Section 90 (1) thereof

Petitioners complaint to Court

Petitioner alleges that after several complaints stating that the pillewa owned by her and,used to go to her paddy field and the threshing floor had been illegally filled and a roadconstructed, 1st 4th Respondents have failed to take steps under the AgrarianDevelopment Act No 46 of 2000.

3

Thus, this application for a writ of Mandamus.

The Petitioner contends that she has got the title for the paddy field and the adjoining pillewa byway of deed marked as PX1A and PX1C. In support of this contention, Petitioner also hadannexed a plan marked PX1B dated16.12.2012, where the survey has been carried out on 26th

October 2010. In the said plan the pillewa is clearly depicted. The Petitioners contention is thatthe pillewa is an adjacent land to her paddy field which consists of the threshing floor, whichunder section 101 of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 falls within the definition ofpaddy land.

In 2015, three years after the plan was made, the Petitioner has become aware that a 12 ft widemotorable gravel road had been constructed by filling the said pillewa. The Petitioners firstcomplaint was that by this particular act, the pillewa has been used for non-agricultural purposesnamely, to construct a motorable gravel road. The said gravel road has been constructed to gainaccess to a house which is alleged to have been constructed by illegally filling an adjoiningpaddy field to the Petitioners land. Upon getting to know about this construction, the Petitionerhas informed the Commissioner-General of The Department of Agrarian Development by herletter dated 06.04.2015 (PX3A) of the same. In the said letter, the Petitioner had stated that sinceshe was having issues with her health, and due to her official duties, she was residing inColombo, and as soon as she got to know about this filling of land in the pillewa she made acomplaint. In the said letter, she has specifically said that no permission has been sought fromher to fill the pillewa and requested the agrarian development Commissioner to institute aninquiry and to advise the Petitioner on the legal status of filling the pillewa.

The Deputy Commissioner of Agrarian Development office Kurunegala by letter dated24.04.2015 had promptly instructed the Divisional Officer to submit a report with observationspertaining to this complaint (PX3B). Subsequently, another letter had been sent by the AssistantCommissioner of Agrarian Development Office (legal) to the Deputy Commissioner of AgrarianDevelopment office Kurunegala dated 20.05.2015 whereby advice had been given to takeappropriate action under Act No. 46 of 2000 (PX5) the said letter caption says as follows,

905

However, in paragraph 2 of the said letter, the advice given is to take action pertaining to anillegally filled paddy field. The Agrarian Services Centre had issued notice on the 5th Respondentasking him to attend an inquiry regarding this complaint (PX6). There is no material todemonstrate whether the inquiry contemplated in PX6 had commenced or what transpired at thesaid inquiry. For whatever the reason, a further notice has been sent dated 03.06.2016 asking the5th Respondent to be present for an inquiry (PX7).

4

The Divisional Officer of Agrarian Services Center Pothuhera had replied to the Petitioner byPX9 and informed her that as per the site inspection, he had found that there had been an illegalconstruction of a house constructed on Edivaldeniya kumbura and the said construction hadtaken place about 8 years prior, the same letter observes that by the construction of the road, thePetitioners cultivating rights are obstructed. Paragraph 4 of the said letter PX9 states as follows,

.

Thus, this letter establishes the fact that a roadway is built and by the said roadway, thePetitioners cultivating rights have been affected.

However, this letter further alleges that the Petitioner has not been present for an inquiry, and asa result, the author of the letter is unable to give the advice sought by the Petitioner pertaining tothe filling of the pillewa. In the reply letter, the Petitioner has explained her absence and statedthat she had not been asked to come for the inquiry but had only been informed of the date of theinquiry. Further, she had clarified that her complaint was not pertaining to the paddy field but onthe illegal filling of the pillewa which she alleged was a violation of the Agrarian DevelopmentAct.

The Divisional Officer of Pothuhera after a field visit had come to a finding that in the year2006, a permanent house had been constructed by Lalitha Kumari without any prior permissionof the Commissioner-General of Agrarian Development. The construction is on a paddy field andthe said land and the house had been transferred to the 5th Respondent in 2015. This has beencommunicated by letter dated 30.06.2015 (PX13). The inspection had further revealed that thefootpath that had been used, had been filled and converted to a roadway to be used to access theillegally constructed house. The letter goes on to state that there had been no legal action takenpertaining to these illegal acts of construction and the Divisional Officer has observed that thefilled roadway had been used, to have access to the threshing floor and the pillewa. This reportfurther establishes the parties involved in the illegal act. Thereafter several correspondences havebeen exchanged between the Petitioner and the Commissioner-General of the Department ofAgrarian Development and several further inquiries have been held.

It is evident by the document marked PX23B that the Assistant Commissioner of the AgrarianDevelopment had held another inquiry dated 10.08.2015 at the Kurunegala district office. Thesaid inquiry had been attended by the Petitioner, the 5th Respondent, and a witness on behalf ofthe Petitioner. At the conclusion of the inquiry and the site inspection carried on 02.11.2015 areport with recommendations had been compiled. In the report, it is observed as follows,

1. 500 .

. . ( )

2. , . .

3. . .

As per the report, the Assistant Commissioner has recommended for legal action to be takenagainst all offenders who have violated the Agrarian Development Act No 46 of 2000. In view ofthe said inquiry report, the Commissioner-General of the Department of Agrarian Developmentby his letter dated 16.12.2015, had informed the Assistant Commissioner of Kurunegala that thesaid construction of the house and the roadway to the said house had been constructed withoutthe written approval of the Agrarian Development Commissioner General and therefore toinstitute action under Act No 46 of 2000. The said letter states as follows,

5/2/45/01 2015.11.04 .

2011 46 2000 46 .

Thus, it is established that there is a violation of the provisions of the Agrarian Development Act,and the final recommendation is to take legal action against the unlawful construction. However,there is no observation or recommendation pertaining to the illegal filling of the road which wasthe grievance of the Petitioner.

Subsequent to this letter the Deputy Commissioner of Agrarian Development Kurunegala byletter dated 17.12.2015 had informed the Divisional Officer of the Agrarian Service Centre ofPothuhera to institute legal action against the unlawful construction (PX27). The Petitionercontended that by this time the Respondents have been concentrating on the illegal constructionof the house in the adjoining field and had failed to consider further action pertaining to theillegal filling of the roadway which was the Petitioners grouse.

However, strangely thereafter, the same Deputy Commissioner who informed the DivisionalOfficer to institute legal action under the Act had written to the Commissioner-General of

6

Agrarian Development seeking advice as to the contemplated legal action (PX28). This was onthe basis of the Divisional Officers Report which had a finding mentioning that the illegalconstruction had been constructed about ten years prior to the inquiry.

This Court finds it strange for the Deputy Commissioner who previously had instructed asubordinate officer to act under the Agrarian Development Act No 46 of 2000, to seek advicefrom the Commissioner-General of agrarian development as to what legal action should be taken.It appears to this Court that by this time, the Respondents had been concentrating only on actionagainst the illegal construction of the house, that they had completely failed to consider thePetitioners complaint of filling of the pillewa, which also contained the threshing floor.

This letter has been replied to by the Commissioner-General of agrarian development by theletter dated 05.04.2017 (PX32). Whereby the author had said that, due to the failure to take anyaction during the relevant period, steps could be taken under the Agrarian Development Act onlyif any new filling or construction is carried out.

While the Commissioner-General and the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development hadbeen corresponding in the way illustrated in the judgment, the Petitioner by her letter dated29.09.2017 had informed the Commissioner-General of Agrarian Development to take legalaction against the perpetrators of the illegal filling of the pillewa and further submitted that if noreply is received by her pertaining to this letter (P42) then she would consider such failure toreply as a refusal which would result in taking appropriate legal action. The Respondents didntcontest the receipt of the letter P42.

At the argument stage, the Petitioner submitted that the Commissioner-General had failed toreply to this letter thus there is an implied refusal to act under the statute.

The learned Counsel for the Respondents contended that the Respondents had taken actionpertaining to the complaint of the Petitioner which is depicted in the documents that have beenfiled by the Petitioner herself. The learned Counsels main contention was that by the saidcorrespondence, the Respondents have acted within the statutory powers given under theAgrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000. Therefore, they have validly discharged the publicduty that was cast on them.

The Respondents took several objections to the petition namely;

The Petitioner is guilty of laches as she had waited from 2006 to 2015 to report the illegalfiling of the pillewa.

The title to the pillewa is contested in a District Court case thus the Petitioner has nolegal right to seek a mandamus.

The Petitioners first prayer should fail as the pillewa does not fall within the definitionof paddy land.

7

This Court will consider these objections.

The learned Counsel also cited the case of Rathnayake and other v C.D Perera and others(1982) 2 SLR 451 whereby it was held that mandamus would be available when a public officerwho is entrusted to perform a public duty had refused to perform. But contended that in thisinstance the public officers had acted within their powers, pursuant to the Agrarian DevelopmentAct.

It is clear from the documents submitted to this Court especially the correspondence between theparties that no sooner the Petitioner had informed of her grievance and sought advice from theCommissioner-General of agrarian development, the Department of Agrarian Development hadsprung into action, and commenced inquiries. But what we observe is that despite the Petitionerinforming the provisions of the Act, that had been violated, the Respondents have failed to takesteps pursuant to the Act to see a conclusion of the inquiry pursuant to the complaint.

Learned Counsel also cited Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka v Messrs Jafferiee andJafferjee PVT Ltd (2005) 1 SLR 89 where the Court formulated a test that should be satisfiedby a Petitioner when seeking relief by way of writ jurisdiction. There the Courts held;

(a) The applicant must have a legal right to the performance of a legal duty by the parties againstwhom the mandamus is sought (R v Barnstaple Justices exp. Carder. The foundation ofmandamus is the existence of a legal right (Napier ex parte)

(b) The right to be enforced must be a Public Right and the duty sought to be enforced mustbe of a public nature.

(c) The legal right to compel must reside in the applicant himself (R v Lewisham Union)

(d) The application must be made in good faith and not for an indirect purpose

This Court finds that in this instance, the Petitioner who is the aggrieved owner cultivator has alegal right to seek redress from 1st - 4th Respondents against an illegal filling of a pillewa if itviolates the provisions of the Act. The answer to this question is available on the findings of theseveral inquiries that had been conducted by the Respondents themselves. One such finding asreflected in PX9 is that there is an illegal construction of a house and illegal filling of the pillewawhich is obstructing the cultivating rights of the Petitioner. The Commissioner-General ofAgrarian Development has instructed the Deputy Commissioner to institute action (PX26). Thus,by the conduct of the Respondents themselves, it is evident that the duty that is sought to beenforced is a statutory duty under the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000.

The Petitioner is seeking a legal right that has been accepted by the agrarian development officerwho had conducted several inquiries pertaining to this issue and concluded that the pillewa hasbeen illegally filled, thereby it is apparent that the Petitioners cultivation rights have been

8

violated. At this stage, it is pertinent to note that as per PX1(B) the threshing floor is also situatedwithin the pillewa.

Up to this time, the Respondents have discharged the public duty entrusted to them under thestatute, but does this public duty ends there? As per the inquiries conducted, the Respondentshave come to several findings. Based on these findings the Respondents have to act as stipulatedby the Act. The Petitioners main argument is that the Respondents have failed to take anyfurther action based on the findings. This Court observes that in view of the 4th Respondentsletter marked as PX23(B) the stipulated action in the said letter has not been carried out.

This would be an appropriate stage to consider the relevant provisions of the Act mentioned inthe letter. Which would also address one of the Objections raised by the Respondents.

Section 32 of the Agrarian Development Act states as follows;

Any person who, without obtaining written permission from the Commissioner-General

(a) Fills up an extent of paddy land with soil or other material or attempts to fill up such

extent of paddy land(b) Uses any extent of paddy land for a purpose other than an agricultural purpose or does

any other act for such purpose(c) Constructs any structure within any extent of paddy land or does any at in furtherance of

such purpose; (d) Removes soil form and extent of paddy land or attempts to do so; or(e) Utilizes and extent of paddy land in violation of the terms and conditions of the

permission issued by the Commissioner-General

The prayer b of the petition prays for a writ of mandamus against 1st to 4th Respondents to actunder section 32(1)(5) and or to act under section 90(1). As per the side note, Section 32(1)contemplates offences using paddy land for purposes other than agricultural cultivation withoutthe permission of the commissioner-general, while section 90 contemplates the interference ofcultivation rights of the owner cultivator or occupier. This would be an appropriate time toconsider the definition of paddy land given in the Act. The said definition states as follows,

paddy land means land which is cultivated with paddy or is prepared for the cultivation ofpaddy or which, having at any time previously been cultivated with paddy, is suitable for thecultivation of paddy, and includes such other land adjoining or appertaining to it as may beused by the cultivator for a threshing floor or for constructing his dwelling house, but does notinclude chena land or any land, which, with the permission of the Commissioner-General isused for any purpose other than cultivation in accordance with the provisions of this Act, orwhich is determined by the Commissioner-General not to be paddy land

On plain reading, the pillewa doesnt fall within the definition of paddy land unless the Petitionercan demonstrate that the pillewa qualifies under such land adjoining or appertaining to it as may

9

be used by the cultivator for a threshing floor or for constructing his dwelling house, as stated inthe section. It appears that the Petitioner too had her doubts on this issue as in her letter dated06.04.2015 she had requested the Commissioner-General to clarify the legal position regardingthe pillewa. As correctly submitted by the Respondents, the Petitioner has failed to answer thisobjection to the satisfaction of the Court and has failed to demonstrate that the pillewa fallswithin the definition.

The Petitioner has failed to demonstrate whether presently the pillewa is used or whether it isused for the purposes defined in the Act. In the absence of such material before the Court, thefirst part of the relief prayed by the Petitioner has to fail.

The Respondents objecting to the relief prayed argue that, for them to act under section 32(1)(5)the offence contemplate has to be an offence that is being committed. The learned Counsel drewthe attention of this Court to sec 32(1) the offences and the way it is described and submits whatthe legislator has contemplated is for section 32(1) to be operative it has to be an offence that isbeing committed in the present but the illegal filling and the construction had taken placesomewhere around 2006. Therefore, the contention of the Respondent is, for them to act undersection 32(5) the contemplated act should be a continuing offence. In view of this, the Courtfinds that the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the pillewa falls under the definition ofpaddy land thus the necessity to answer this objection would not arise.

The next objection Respondents raised was that for the Petitioner to complain, the Petitioner hasnot established title to the pillewa. Thus, the Petitioner has no legal right to seek a writ. Tosubstantiate this objection, the Respondents submitted that there is pending litigation pertainingto the ownership of the pillewa. Both parties are not at variance with the existence of the casethat the 5th Respondent has instituted against the Petitioner of this application. It was commonground that the said case is still pending. The Petitioners grouse is filling of the said pillewa andconstruction of the road on it. However, we have perused the plaint in the District Court case(P36) in the said case the title to pillewa is not contested. Hence the Respondents objection onthe Petitioners right to file this case based on title fails. This brings us to the next objectionraised by the Respondents on lashes and undue delay.

As per the inquiry reports that have been submitted to the Court and of the Petitioners ownpleadings and submissions, it is evident that the paddy field had been filled and a house had beenconstructed in the year 2006. However, there is no evidence or material submitted to this Courtto establish when the illegal filling of the pillewa had taken place or when the alleged road hadbeen constructed on the disputed pillewa. Therefore, this Court is not in a position to come to theconclusion as to when the alleged filling of the pillewa has taken place, as no material evidencehas been submitted to this Court to demonstrate the same. It is also pertinent to note thatirrespective of when the construction had taken place, the Respondents has commenced theirinquiries on the complaint received in the year 2015 and the relevant officers had recommendedaction to be taken. If there was an undue delay, the Respondents should have communicated it to

10

the Petitioner but in this case, we dont find such a thing has happened. Further, the Petitionersgrouse is that the Respondents have failed to pursue the legal action recommended pursuant totheir findings. We also find that the Respondents have failed to inform the reasons for theirinability to take further steps based on the findings, especially in view of their previous adviseswhich contemplate legal action.

This takes us to the alternate relief prayed by the Petitioner. This Court will now consider thealternative relief prayed by the Petitioner namely the Respondents to act under section 90(1) ofthe Act the said section reads as follows. Where a complaint is made to the Commissioner-General by any owner cultivator or occupier of agricultural land that any person is interferingwith or attempting to interfere with the cultivation rights, threshing rights, rights of using athreshing floor, the right of removing agricultural produce or the tight to the use of anagricultural road of such owner cultivator or occupier, the Commissioner-General afterinquiry may if he is satisfied that such interference will result in damage or loss of crop orlivestock, issue an order on such person cultivator or occupier requiring him to comply withsuch directions as may be specified in such order necessary for the protection of such rights :

Provided that an order under this section shall not be made for the eviction of any person fromsuch agricultural land:

Provided further that an order issued under subsection (1) shall not prejudice the right title orinterest of such person, cultivator or occupier to such land, crop or livestock in respect ofwhich such order is made

The learned Counsel for the Respondents contention was the alternate relief prayed, has to failas the Petitioner had failed to complain that she is being prevented from using the pillewa or thather cultivation rights have been affected. Thus, the Respondents contended that the Petitioner hasfailed to trigger the statutory requirements to institute an investigation under section 90(1) of theAct. In considering this objection of the Respondent namely, that there had been no specificcomplaints pertaining to the obstruction of the cultivating right of the Petitioner, we find that indocuments marked as PX8, PX10, there is a reference by the Petitioner drawing the attention ofthe Respondent to act under section 90(1) of the Act and to preserve her cultivating rights. TheRespondents contention that the Petitioner has not made a proper complaint to state that hercultivating rights are violated cannot stand ground as in the letters sent by the Petitioner namelyin PX10, the Petitioner has specifically complained and sought relief.

Therefore, in our view with this complaint and other material, the Respondents had sufficientgrounds to act under section 90(1) of the Act. This complaint is sufficient for the Respondent tocommence an inquiry. Further, it is evident that the letter dated 12.06.2015 (PX9) is a result ofthis complaint and in the said findings, the divisional officer has come to a conclusion that thePetitioners cultivation rights had been affected. Accordingly, the Petitioners contention wasthat the Respondents should have taken action under section 90 of the Act, has merit.

11

In our view the Petitioners contention is well-founded and this objection of the Respondents hasno merit and has to fail. We also find that the Respondents at no stage had submitted that thePetitioners paddy field had not been cultivated or abandoned. However, consequently, they hadtaken up the position that the filling of the roadway and the construction of the house was illegal.If so, what prevented them from taking action under the powers vested in them pursuant to theprovisions of the Agrarian Development Act No.46 of 2000. Especially under section 90(1). TheRespondents have failed to answer this question and have failed to act under the said section. theRespondents have failed to give any reason as to why they failed to act under the said sectionother than to state that there was no complaint, which this Court is not inclined to accept on thegrounds specified above.

Accordingly for the reasons set out in this Judgement, the application of the Petitioner is partlyallowed, this Court grants a Writ of mandamus as prayed for in Prayer (b) alternative relief, toact under section 90(1) of Act No. 46 of 2000 and according to law. As the Petitioner has beenpartially successful in this application, we do not intend to award a cost. Thus, the parties willbear their own cost.
