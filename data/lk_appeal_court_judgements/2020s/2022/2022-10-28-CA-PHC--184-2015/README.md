Judgment

The Petitioner instituted action bearing No. 05/2013 in the High Court of Anuradhapura

praying inter alia the following relief:

a) Issue notices;

b) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus to convey the No.1

stall, in the 14 Stall Trade Centre at Anuradhapura Dharmapala Mawatha according

to the value of 07 and conditions in 09;

c) Grant a stay order which will stay the proceedings of evicting Petitioner

Respondent from the said stall until this matter is concluded;

d) Grant an Interim Order restraining the sale of the said stall to a 3rd party until this

matter is concluded.

However, the Respondent filed objections by way of written submissions and both parties

agreed to file further written submissions to dispose this matter. It appears that the

learned High Court Judge held in favour of the Petitioner and granted a writ of mandamus

against the Respondent.

Being aggrieved by the said order dated 22.10.2015, the Respondent-Appellant had

preferred an appeal in terms of Article 154P (4) of the Constitution. When this matter

was taken up for hearing, a preliminary objection that the Respondent-Appellants appeal

is filed out of time was raised on behalf of the Petitioner-Respondent. On that basis, the

Petitioner-Respondent sought a dismissal of this appeal.

Since both parties agreed to dispose the said preliminary objection by way of written

submissions, Court allowed parties to file written submissions only in respect of the said

preliminary objection. It was the contention of Petitioner-Respondent that the

Respondent-Appellant had not filed the petition of appeal within the prescribed period.

It was submitted on behalf of the Petitioner-Respondent that for the purpose of the

preliminary objection, the following dates of events may be noted.

i. The Judgment of the Provincial High Court was delivered on 22.10.2015

ii. Notice of appeal was filed on 05.11.2015

Page 3 of 5

iii. The petition of appeal was filed on 22.12.2015

As per Rule 11(3) of the Court of Appeal (Procedure for appeals from High Court) Rules

1988 regarding the procedure to be followed in Appeals from orders made by a High Court

in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 154P (4) of the Constitution, a notice of

appeal should be presented within a period of 14 days from the date of the Order appealed

against was pronounced. How the said 14 days should be calculated is stated in the same

Rule. In the case at hand, the notice of appeal has been filed within time. As per Rule

12(2), the petition of appeal should be filed in the High Court itself within 60 days from

the date of the Order appealed against was pronounced.

The Order was pronounced on 22.10.2015.

When the date of pronouncement (22.10.2015) is not - 09 days

included, the number of days from October 23rd to 31st

The number of days in November - 30 days

Therefore, the total number of days from 22.10.2015 to - 39 days

30.11.2015

Remaining days for the petition to be presented - 21 days

Thus, petition of appeal should have been filed on 21.12.2015. However, the petition has

been filed on 22.12.2015, which is 1 day out of time. Though Rule 11(3) as stated above

specifies as to the manner how 14 days should be calculated, Rule 12(2) does not state as

to how the 60 days should be calculated.

It appears that the Appellant has filed notice of appeal within 14 days from the date of

Order in terms of Section 755 of the Civil Procedure Code. However, Appellant has failed

to comply with Section 755(3) of the Civil Procedure Code by tendering the petition of

appeal within 60 days from the date of Judgment.

It is seen that Section 755(3) of the Civil Procedure Code requires Appellant to tender the

petition of appeal to the original Court within 60 days from the date of Judgement or

Final Order. Thus, filing the notice of appeal in terms of Section 754 (4) and filing the

Page 4 of 5

petition of appeal in terms of Section 755(3) are mandatory provisions when preferring an

appeal.

In the case of Vithana Vs. Weerasinghe & Another [1981] 1 SLR 52, the Appellant had

complied with the provisions of Section 754 of the Civil Procedure Code by giving notice

of appeal within the prescribed period of 14 days but had failed to file the petition of

appeal within 60 days. His petition of appeal was late by one day and his Attorney at Law

filed an affidavit to show that the omission was due to his own illness and was a cause

beyond the control of his client. Justice Wanasundara observed;

I find that Section 759(2) is adequate to deal with an application of this kind and

it is precisely to these provisions that a person such as the present appellant must

look for relief. In my view, the facts of that case have no bearing to the instant

case. It is my view that the presence of the Petitioner was not essential to present

the petition of appeal. The Attorney at Law on record had the full authority to file

the petition of appeal. It is the Attorney at Law on record who has to file the

petition of appeal and specify the grounds of objection to the Judgment. The

absence or the presence of the Petitioner in person is immaterial to the filing of

the petition of appeal. It is my view that the provisions of Section 759(2) cannot

be invoked to condone the negligence and carelessness of the Attorney at Law on

record.

Similarly, in Municipal Council of Colombo Vs. Piyasena [1980] 2 SLR 39 Justice

Ranasinghe emphasized that;

Whilst the provisions of Section 754 (4) of the Civil Procedure Code specifically

states that, in the computation of the period of 14 days set out therein, the day

on which the Order or Decree appealed from was pronounced, the day on which

the petition is presented to Court, and all intervening Sundays and public holidays

should be excluded from such conclusion and no such exclusions are permitted in

the computation of the period of 60 days set out in Section 755(3) of Civil

Procedure Code.

Having regard to the foregoing matter, His Lordship is of the opinion that in the

computation on the 60 days set out in Section 755(3), Sundays and public holidays are

not to be excluded and should be included in the calculation of the 60-day period.

Page 5 of 5

Therefore, I am of the opinion that the petition of appeal, which has been presented in

this case, has been so presented to Court after the expiry of the period of 60 days within

which it had, according to the provisions of Section 755(3) of the Civil Procedure Code,

to be presented to the District Court.

In view of the aforementioned Judgments, it is imperative to note that the provision made

in Section 755(3) is mandatory. Thus, the preliminary objection raised on behalf of the

Petitioner-Respondent that the appeal is out of time is upheld.

Hence, the appeal of the Appellant is dismissed without cost.
