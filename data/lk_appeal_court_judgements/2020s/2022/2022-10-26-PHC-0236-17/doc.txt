Judgment

The Petitioner-Appellant in this matter was granted a license by the Geological

Survey Mines Bureau in year 2011 and it was extended till 03.04.2013. Since the said

license was not extended after 03.04.2013, the Petitioner-Appellant alleged that

the 1st Respondent has maliciously refused to grant an extension for the said license.

Petitioner-Appellant is of the view that he had a legitimate expectation that the

said license would be extended after the expiry of the said period.

Consequently, Petitioner-Appellant had preferred an application by way of a writ to

the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa to have the decision made in document

marked as 6 quashed by a writ of certiorari and to have a writ of mandamus

Page 3 of 6

directing Respondent-Respondents to grant a sand mining licence. It appears that

the Respondents had filed objections against the application of the Petitioner-

Appellant. After the hearing of the said application, the learned High Court Judge

had relied upon the objections filed by the Respondents and had dismissed

Petitioner-Appellants application bearing No. WA 22/15.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, Petitioner-Appellant [hereinafter referred to as

Appellant] had preferred this appeal to have the Order of the learned High Court

Judge set aside and to have reliefs prayed in the petition of appeal granted.

The Court draws the attention to document marked and produced as 6 which is

the letter sent by the Divisional Secretary of Kalawana to Appellant on 13.10.2015.

As per the said letter, Divisional Secretary had informed the Appellant why his sand

license was not extended and why the Divisional Secretary has not recommended to

extend the license issued to the names of persons referred in 1-10.

It is worthy to note that the learned High Court Judge in his Order has stated

Petitioner-Appellant has not shown reasons sufficient enough to grant a writ of

mandamus against the 1st Respondent. Moreover, the learned High Court Judge has

stated in his Order that Petitioner-Appellant is eligible for the renewal of the

license, provided he clears the boundary matter in Lot 33 AM and fulfils the

requirements stated by Geological Survey Mines Bureau and Central Environmental

Authority.

It appears that the letter 6 which the Petitioner is challenging, is a letter issued

by the 1st Respondent in response to letter 5 sent by the Petitioner. According to

the said letter 6, it sets out various adverse environmental and social impacts of

sand mining in the areas which were considered by Regional Coordinating

Committee.

It was submitted on behalf of the Respondents that in terms of Section 35(1) of the

Mines and Minerals Act No. 33 of 1992, the issue of license is at the discretion of the

Geological Survey and Mines Bureau. The 1st Respondent is acting on the delegated

Page 4 of 6

powers of the Bureau under Section 8(1) and the 1st Respondent is vested with the

delegated power to recommend the issue/renewal or cancellation of the license.

It was further submitted that the power to issue or renew the license is only vested

in the Bureau and that the application of the Petitioner is patently misconceived on

the very premise that the Petitioner has not sought any relief against the Bureau.

In paragraph 13 of the statement of objections, the Respondents contend that the

Bureau received a complaint that the Petitioner was engaged in sand mining in

contravention of the conditions of the license and the Bureau by its letter dated

30.11.2012 intimated the same to the 1st Respondent. The 1st Respondent is

exercising the delegated powers under Section 8(1) of the Act.

It is pertinent to note that nowhere in the Petition, the Petitioner alleges that he

has submitted an application to the Bureau for the renewal of the license. As such,

there is no decision by the Bureau not to grant the renewal of the license to the

Petitioner.

The impugned document marked 6 is only a communication by the 1st Respondent

to the Petitioner containing the reasons why recommendation to renew the license

was not made by the 1st Respondent in respect of several other license holders other

than the Petitioner.

The position taken up by the Respondents was that the Petitioner has not produced

his application for renewal which he ought to have submitted to the Bureau nor has

he submitted to Court the decision taken by the Bureau in terms of the Act not to

grant the renewal.

The Courts attention was drawn to Section 39(1) of the Act, which makes provisions

for an appeal to the Secretary. Section 39(1) of the Act makes provision for an appeal

to the Secretary if a party is aggrieved by a decision of the Bureau refusing the

issuance or renewal of the licence under Section 35 or Section 36. It appears that

the Petitioner has not exhausted this statutory remedy which is equally efficacious.

However, it is worthy to note that in order for the Petitioner to be successful in a

writ of certiorari quashing the decision in 6, the Petitioner ought to establish that

the decision of the 1st Respondent not to recommend the renewal was tainted with

irrationality, illegality, unreasonableness or procedural impropriety or any ground

for judicial review. However, the Petitioner in his application for a writ of certiorari

has failed to establish the aforementioned elements in order to successfully obtain

a writ of certiorari.

Furthermore, it is settled law that in order to succeed in an application made on

grounds of legitimate expectation, the expectation must be legitimate. A mistake

or a decision based on erroneous factual data or illegality cannot be the basis for a

legitimate expectation.

I quote Brennan J. in Attorney General of New South Wales Vs. Quinn [1990] 64

Australian LR 327;

Legitimate expectation is not the key which unlocks the treasury of natural

justice and it ought not to unlock the gate which shuts the Court out of review

on the merits.

A careful consideration of the doctrine of legitimate expectation clearly shows that

whether an expectation is legitimate or not is a question of fact. This has to be

decided not only on the basis of the application made by the aggrieved party before

Court, but also by taking into consideration whether there had been any arbitrary

exercise of power by the administrative authority in question.

Apparently, the Appellant had not established the conduct of the Respondents is

illegal, unlawful, irrational, unreasonable and tainted with malice. Furthermore, the

Appellant has not substantiated his contention that the Respondent had violated the

legitimate expectation and the rules of natural justice. Moreover, the Appellant had

not established that he has a right to a renewal of the license and that there is a

corresponding public duty on the part of the 1st Respondent to grant prior approval

of the same.

Page 6 of 6

In view of the foregoing reasons, it is apparent that the Petitioner has failed to

establish a case that warrants a remedy by way of judicial review. Thus, the Order

of the learned High Court Judge refusing to grant a writ of certiorari and mandamus

is well founded.

Hence, I am not inclined to grant reliefs prayed by the Appellant in the prayer to

the Petition of Appeal.

Thus, this appeal of the Petitioner-Appellant is dismissed with cost fixed at

Rs.25,000/-.
