Judgement

The learned Quasi has by his order dated 22.11.2014 ordered maintenance for

Rs. 15,000/- monthly to the 01st respondent and Rs. 10,000/- monthly for the

2 | W r i t 2 9 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n &J u s ti c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

child against the petitioner. The petitioner has appealed to the Board of Quazis,

which vacated the said order and directed an inquiry de novo.

In the subsequent inquiry the 02nd respondent Quazi has by order dated

16.09.2017 has ordered to pay Rs. 12,000/- monthly for the 01st respondent

and Rs. 10,000/- monthly for the child.

The petitioner has again preferred an appeal to the Board of Quazis. But this

fact was not known to the 02nd respondent who issued notice on the petitioner

and thereafter an enforcement order which he directed to the Magistrates

Court. In the Magistrates Court the petitioner has paid the arrears of

maintenance.

The petitioner in this application seeks a writ of certiorari to quash the

enforcement order of the 02nd respondent.

But it is admitted that although the petitioner has filed a motion before the

Board of Quazis to issue an interim order against the 02nd respondent it has

never been supported.

The 02nd respondent therefore did not have any impediment against exercising

his jurisdiction under section 64(1) of Part VIII of Muslim Marriages and

Divorce Act.

Hence there is no reason to issue a writ of certiorari in this application. The

application is dismissed.
