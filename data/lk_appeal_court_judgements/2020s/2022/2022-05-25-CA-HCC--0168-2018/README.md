JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted by the Attorney General for

committing an offence under Section 365 B (2) (b) of the Penal Code for

committing the offence of Grave Sexual Abuse on Rathna Kumara between

the period of 03.09.2005 and 11.09.2005.

The trial commenced on 20/10/2009. After leading all necessary witnesses,

the prosecution closed the case. The Learned High Court Judge had called

for the defence and the Appellant had made a dock statement from the

dock and closed the case.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the evidence presented by

both parties, convicted the Appellant as charged and sentenced the

Appellant to 07 years of rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of

Rs.5000/- subject to a default sentence of 06 months simple

imprisonment. In addition, a compensation of Rs.100000/- was ordered

with a default sentence of 12 months simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

3 | P a g e

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the

Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the

Covid 19 pandemic. It is further informed that the Appellant is on bail and

he is waiting outside the court due to Covid 19 pandemic restrictions.

The following Grounds of Appeal are raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. The victims evidence is contradictory per se and inter se.

2. The delay of the victims complaint is not explained in his evidence.

3. The prosecution has not led evidence favourable to the Appellant and

have thereby violated Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance.

4. Except the victims evidence all other corroborative evidence called by

the prosecution are hearsay evidence.

The Facts of this case albeit briefly are as follows.

According to PW1, the victim of this case, he was about 9 years old when

he had undergone this ordeal. The Appellant was the caretaker of Karuna

Sevana Childrens Home, Malabe where the victim was living at the time.

Only 03 children were accommodated in the said home when the incident

took place. In the morning of the date of the incident, the Appellant had

called the victim to the kitchen and entrusted the victim with scraping

coconut. While the victim was engaged in the said chore, the appellant had

gone there, removed the victims pair of shorts and had engaged in anal

intercourse with the victim. As it was painful, the victim started shouting.

After this incident the victim had vacated the home. One day the Appellant

had come to his school and slapped him in front of the teacher. The victim

had first informed the incident to the building workers who were engaged

in repairing the childrens home. Thereafter this was intimated to Rev.

Balasooriya who was in charge of the childrens home.

In the first ground of Appeal the Appellant contends that the victims

evidence is contradictory per se and inter se.

4 | P a g e

The victim was 12 years old when he gave evidence before the court. His

family was scattered when his mother went abroad for employment. After

his mother left, his aunt brought him to Colombo and admitted him to the

childrens home situated in Thalahena. He had then commenced his

schooling from there. Several other children were also living there. Two

persons had been working in the said home. Two young girls who were

working there also had left during that period. Hence, he had been called

upon to assist in the kitchen.

One day the Appellant called the victim to the kitchen in early hours and

entrusted him to scraping coconut in the kitchen. This is when the

Appellant had taken advantage of the victim as stated before. Only he and

the Appellant were in the kitchen at that time. Other children were sleeping

when this incident happened to him.

He had revealed this incident to his friends at the childrens house and

they had in turn mentioned this to the people who have come to do the

repair of the building during that time. The said workers had then informed

this to the Rev. Father in charge of the childrens home and had filed a case

against the Appellant. After 4-5 days the Appellant had quit the job and left

the place.

One day after leaving the childrens home, the Appellant had gone to the

victims school and slapped him in front of his teacher. Thereafter, a

complaint had been lodged at the police station and the victim had been

subjected to a medical examination.

In the cross examination the victim had given evidence without any

contradictions or omissions. When the incident happened, he was only 8

years old. But his evidence was quite consistent and clearly implicated the

Appellant. He denied that the persons who accompanied him to the police

5 | P a g e

had taught him things to be told to the police before going to the police

station.

As the evidence given by the victim is clear and quite consistent, the

Learned High Court Judge has accurately considered and accepted them in

this case. Hence, this ground of appeal is devoid any merit.

In the second ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the delay of the

victims complaint is not explained in his evidence.

The victims contention is that immediately after the incident he had told

the incident to his colleagues and through them and the workers this had

been intimated to the Rev. Father who was in charge of the home. When he

was questioned as to when he lodged the complaint, the victim had said

that he cannot remember. The incident had happened when he was 8 years

old and when he gave evidence, he was 12 years old. From a child of this

age, it is not possible to obtain all details accurately.

In this case the victim had given plausible evidence at all material points.

As pointed out earlier, his evidence is not tainted with discrepancies or

ambiguity. Due to aforesaid reasons, the second ground of appeal is also

devoid of any merit.

In the third ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the prosecution

has not led evidence favourable to the Appellant and thereby violated

Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance.

The prosecution had called all necessary witnesses to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt and the defence had the liberty to cross examine

them. The Learned High Court Judge had considered all the evidence

presented by both parties to come to his conclusion. Hence it is incorrect to

state that the prosecution had not led evidence favourable to the Appellant.

The Learned High Court Judge had accurately stated in his judgment that

6 | P a g e

the stance taken by the Appellant in his dock statement did not tally with

his defence taken during the trial. Further, the learned High Court Judge

had commented that the Appellant had taken a lethargic attitude despite

the advice of the court to consider the seriousness of the charge.

Due to aforesaid reasons, the Appellant is not successful under this ground

as well.

In the final ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that except the

victims evidence all other corroborative evidence called by the prosecution

are hearsay evidence.

The victim in his evidence told the court that he revealed this incident to

his friends namely, Tharaka, Thimira and Dilshan. In return they had told

this to the persons who were engaged in building repair work.

PW3, the contractor who had undertaken the repair of the buildings in the

childrens home premises told that when he came to the work site on the

day of the incident around 11:30 hours, his co-workers as well as the

children of the home had told him about the incident committed on the

victim. He had seen the victim crying at that time. He immediately

informed this to the Rev. Father over the phone. Although his co-workers

had decided to handover the Appellant to the police, he had prevented and

informed the same to the Rev. Father instead.

PW2, Nihal Piyasena in his evidence told the court that the victim had told

him about the incident that happened to him. He had told this to the

contractor immediately.

PW8, Dilshan Chaturanga, a colleague of the victim at the childrens home

told the court that the victim had told him about the incident in the

morning on the date of incident. He had told this to a Sir and he had told

that to the Rev. Father.

7 | P a g e

PW11, the lady teacher who had witnessed the slapping by the Appellant

on the victim gave evidence and corroborated the evidence of the victim.

All the persons who received the information about the sexual assault on

the victim had given evidence in this case. Hence their evidence is not

hearsay, as all necessary witnesses are called to corroborate the evidence of

the victim.

Hence, this ground too has no merit.

In this case the victim had given firm evidence as to the atrocities

committed on him by the Appellant. The subsequent conduct of the

Appellant further strengthens the prosecution case.

Even though the incident had happened when the victim was at a tender

age, he had given evidence without any contradictions or omissions.

In Iswari Prasad v. Mohamed Isa 1963 AIR (SC) 1728 at 1734 His

Lordship held that;

In considering the question as to whether evidence given by the

witness should be accepted or not, the court has, no doubt, to examine

whether the witness is, an interested witness and to enquire whether

the story deposed to by him is probable and whether it has been

shaken in cross-examination. That is whether there is a ring of truth

surrounding his testimony.

Similarly, Justice Thakkar in Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v State of

Gujarat 1983 AIR SC 753 stated:

By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video

tape is replayed on the mental screen.

8 | P a g e

Considering the evidence led in this case and guided by the judgements

above, I conclude that this is not an appropriate case in which to interfere

with the judgement delivered by the Learned High Court Judge on

30/08/2018 against the Appellant. I therefore, dismiss the appeal.

The Learned High Court Judge of Colombo is hereby directed to issue

notice on the Appellant to appear before the High Court, as he is on bail

pending appeal, and to comply with this judgement.
