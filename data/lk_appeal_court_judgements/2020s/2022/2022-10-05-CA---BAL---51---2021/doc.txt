MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant matter has been filed under the Provisions of the Assistance to and

Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No. 04 of 2015 to obtain bail for the

suspect namely, Rajapaksha Pedige Darshana Ruwan Kumara.

The counsel for the suspect stated that the substantive matter in the instant case has

been a theft of 18 coconuts against the suspect committed on 20/01/2021. The

suspect had been bailed out by the Magistrate for the said offence. Thereafter, on

21/01/2021 the virtual complainant in the substantive matter has lodged a complaint

against the suspect on 21/01/2021 alleging that the complainant had been assaulted

by the suspect. The police had produced the suspect on 03/02/2021 and he had been

in remand ever since.

The counsel for the petitioner suspect urged that the suspect had been in remand

over 01 year without any judicial proceedings being instituted against him.

The state Counsel appearing for the Attorney General objected to the application on

the basis that the suspect has 01 Previous Conviction and 01 pending case in the

nature of Dangerous drugs. The state Counsel further submitted that IB extracts have

been submitted to the Attorney General and that the indictment is under

consideration.

Considering the submissions of both parties it is the considered view of this Court

that the suspect had been in remand for over 01 year, without any judicial

proceedings being instituted against him. The purpose of the instant act is to

safeguard the rights of witnesses and victims but it also states that proceedings under

this Act should be given priority. Therefore, in the instant matter there is a delay of

more than 01 year and there is no definite date of any judicial proceedings being

initiated against the suspect. As such, we consider this matter to be exceptional

enough to enlarge the suspect namely Rajapaksha Pedige Darshana Ruwan Kumara

on bail. Hence, the suspect is enlarged on bail on the following grounds,

01. A cash bail of Rs. 50,000/-

02. Two sureties to the value of 100,000/- each

03. The suspect to report to the relevant Police Station on every last Sunday of

the month.

04. The suspect is severely warned not to interfere with victim or the victims

family, if it is reported the instant bail order would be cancelled.

As such the instant application for bail is allowed. The Registrar of this Court is

directed to convey the instant order to the relevant Registrar of the Magistrate

Court.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
