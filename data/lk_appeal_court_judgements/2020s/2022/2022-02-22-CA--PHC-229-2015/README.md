Prasantha De Silva, J.

Judgment This appeal emanates from the Order of the Provincial High Court of the Northern Province holden

in Vavuniya in HCRA 232/2012, where the Complainant-Petitioner canvassed the Order of the

learned Primary Court Judge in case bearing No. 4091 of the Primary Court of Mannar.

The Complainant-Petitioner-Appellant [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Complainant]

filed information dated 08.10.2010 under and in terms of the provisions of Section 66 (1) (b) of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 informing the breach of peace affecting the

land in dispute.

The learned Primary Court Judge of Mannar directed the notices to be served on the Respondent-

Respondent-Respondent [hereinafter referred to as the Respondent] and affixed on the land after

being satisfied of the possible breach of peace as stated above. Subsequently, the parties filed their

respective affidavits and counter affidavits, and the learned Primary Court Judge allowed the

parties to file written submissions.

It appears that the position taken up by the Complainant is as follows;

Subject matter was seized and possessed by Saveri Soosaipillai and his predecessors since

1904;

The Complainant has constructed a house and engaged in cultivation;

The subject matter was mortgaged on several occasions by virtue of deeds of transfer; [M1

to M4]

Page 3 of 5

However, the possession of the subject matter remained with him and he cultivated the land

except the time he was internally displaced and resettled;

When he ploughed the land for cultivation on 29.09.2012, he was threatened to leave the

paddy land by the Vidathaltheevu Police at the instigation of the Respondent.

However, the Respondent had stated in his affidavits as follows;

The subject matter was purchased for a valuable consideration by him and his brother in

1983;

He and his brother cultivated the subject matter in 1983 , 1984 and 1985 and had to leave

that area due to pressure by a terrorist group;

He could not visit there until the area was fully liberated by the Government;

He cleared the land in August 2010 and erected a fence.

It was the position of the Respondent that he was occupying the said land in dispute from 1983 to

1990. After the riots, the Respondent was evacuated from the said land in dispute and the

Respondent returned to the said land in 1997.

From 1997 onwards the Respondent has been cultivating the said paddy land in dispute without

any disturbances. On or around 2010, the Appellant forcibly entered into the said land in dispute

in order to cultivate the paddy and the Respondents complained to the Police who gave instructions

to both parties not to enter into the said land in dispute. Subsequently, the Complainant has filed

the instant case in terms of Section 66 under Primary Code Procedure.

It was submitted on behalf of the Respondent that the Respondent has purchased the said land in

dispute in 1983 and was in possession from 1983 onwards except during the civil war period which

is an exceptional circumstance. According to the complaint made on 16.11.2010 by the

Respondent to the Police, it clearly indicates that the Respondent was in possession of the disputed

land in 2010. The said complaint made by the Respondent to the Police Station of Vidataltivu on

16.11.2010 is filed on record. The Complainant-Petitioner-Appellant had instituted the instant

action marking documents P1-P12. Subsequently, Respondent-Respondent-Respondent had filed

the affidavits with documents marked R1-R15. Since the dispute is relating to the possession of

land, it is the duty of the learned Primary Court Judge to ascertain who was in possession of the

Page 4 of 5

land in dispute at the time of filing the information under Section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act and make Order as to who is entitled to the possession of the land in dispute.

The Complainant-Petitioner-Appellant marked and produced documents M5-M12 with the affidavit

and had claimed possession of the disputed land relying on the said documents. However, counter

affidavit of the Respondent states that the Police Officers have directed both parties not to enter

the land in dispute.

Furthermore, the Complainant-Respondent-Appellant submitted that according to the documents

marked as M5-M12, it establishes the Complainant-Respondent-Appellant was in exclusive

possession of the disputed land and that he was engaged in cultivating the same. Nevertheless, it

is worthy to peruse those documents marked and produced as M5, M6, M7, M8, M9, M10, M11 and

M12.

It was the contention of the Complainant that the disputed paddy land was in control of the

Complainant-Respondent-Appellant thus, he is entitled for an order in terms of Section 68 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act. Similarly, Court shall inquire in terms of Section 68 (3) of the

Act, to the question whether such person was dispossessed of such possession for the last two

months before granting an order in respect of the right of possession.

As such, it was contended by Complainant-Respondent-Appellant, that the learned Primary Court

Judge and the learned Provincial High Court Judge had erred in Law by failing to examine the

question of possession and right to cultivate in deciding that the Respondent was entitled to the

possession of the subject matter.

It is to be observed that the said documents M5-M12 do not establish the possession of the

Complainant-Respondent-Appellant relevant to the period of instituting the action on 06.12.2010.

On the other hand, in view of the complaint made by Respondent-Respondent-Respondent on

16.11.2010 to the Vidataltivu Police Station, it substantiates that the Complainant-Respondent-

Appellant had forcibly entered into the land in dispute and had removed the barbed wire fence

erected on the boundary of the disputed land.

Therefore, it establishes that the Respondent had been dispossessed from the disputed land within

a period of two months immediately before the date of instituting the instant action under Section

66 of the Act.

In terms of Section 68 (3) of the Act, the Respondents possession be restored to the disputed land.

Therefore, we see no reason for us to interfere with the Order of the learned Magistrate of Mannar

and the Order of the learned Provincial High Court Judge of Vavuniya.

Hence, we affirm the Order dated 10.01.2012 by the learned Magistrate of Mannar and the Order

of the learned Provincial High Court Judge dated 28.02.2015 and dismiss this Appeal of the

Complainant-Respondent-Appellant with costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL K.K.A.V. Swarnadhipathi, J.

I agree.
