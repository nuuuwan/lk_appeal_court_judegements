    "text": "While the seriousness of the offence will be the starting point, the approach to sentencing should be individualistic and focused on the child or young person, as opposed to offence focused. For a child or young person the sentence should focus on rehabilitation where possible. A court should also consider the effect the sentence is likely to have on the child or young person (both positive and negative) as well as any underlying factors contributing to the offending behaviour. Domestic and international laws dictate that a custodial sentence should always be a measure of last resort for children and young people and statute provides that a custodial sentence may only be imposed when the offence is so serious that no other sanction is appropriate. It is important to bear in my mind any factors that may diminish the culpability of a child or young person. Children and young people are not fully developed and they have not attained full maturity. As such, this can impact on their decision making and risk taking behaviour. It is important to consider the extent to which the child or young person has been acting impulsively and whether their conduct has been affected by inexperience, emotional volatility or negative influences. They may not fully appreciate the effect their actions can have on other people and may not be capable of fully understanding the distress and pain they cause to the victims of their crimes. Children and young people are also likely to be susceptible to peer pressure and other external influences and changes taking place during adolescence can lead to experimentation, resulting in criminal behaviour. When considering a child or young persons age their emotional and developmental age is of at least equal importance to their Chronological age (if not greater).",

Thus, I am of the view that this is a fit case to deviate from the prescribed minimum mandatory sentence of 7 years imprisonment. Although the learned High Court Judge in her sentencing remarks (at pages 331, 332 and 333 of the appeal brief) has rightly taken into consideration the aggravating factors such as the tender age of the victim, she has failed to even mention that the appellant was 16 years of age and was a juvenile at the time he committed the offence. Therefore, I find that the sentence of 7 years imprisonment imposed on the appellant by the learned High Court Judge is wrong in principle. 12. The learned High Court Judge has rightly considered the following",

According to the particulars of the offence in count No.2, the charge that was added during the course of the trial and on which the appellant was convicted, the appellant has squeezed the penis of the victim. Although, the mother of the child victim has said in evidence that she saw redness on the childs penis, the Medical Officer who examined the victim has said in his report and testified that there were no injuries detected on the penis of the child. 14.
