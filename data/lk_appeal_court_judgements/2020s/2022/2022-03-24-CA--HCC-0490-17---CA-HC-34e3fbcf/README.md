Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

The five accused appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

appellants) were indicted before the High Court of Kegalle on the following

counts.

(1) For being members of an unlawful assembly along with one

Marasinghage Gunaratna, who is dead, with the common object of

causing injuries to Alfred Sirimal Bandara on 29th September 1995

an offence punishable in terms of section 140 of the Penal Code.

Page 4 of 16

(2) At the same time and at the same transaction for causing the

death of the above mentioned Bandara, an offence punishable in

terms of section 296 read with section 146 of the Penal Code.

(3) At the same time and at the same transaction for causing the

death of the above mentioned Bandara, an offence punishable in

terms of section 296 read with section 32 of the Penal Code.

The 1st accused appellant has absconded the Court throughout the trial,

and the trial has been proceeded against him in his absentia after taking

due steps under the provisions of section 241 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act.

After trial without a jury, all the appellants were found guilty as charged and

were sentenced to six months rigorous imprisonment and a fine of rupees

5000/- on count one, and the death sentence on counts two and three.

Subsequently, when the 1st accused appellant was arrested and produced

on the open warrant issued against him, he was given an opportunity under

section 241(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, enabling him to

establish that his absence from the Court was due to bona fide reasons.

After a due inquiry in that regard, the learned High Court Judge rejected his

reasoning by his order dated 10-05-2019.

As all the appeals are appeals challenging the judgment dated 14-09-2017

by the learned High Court Judge of Kegalle, the parties agreed that the

appeal should be considered together.

Facts in brief: -

The deceased Sirimal Bandara was the brother of Swarnalatha (PW-02) and

was at her home on the day of the incident namely, 29-09-1995. He has

come there to help her with the ongoing repairs to the roof of her house. On

the day of the incident at around 7.30-8.00 p.m. in the night, her brother

had been rolling some electrical cables along with her son Bandara. The roof

of the house had been removed at that time for the ongoing repairs and

Page 5 of 16

there was no electricity. The house had three lamps lit at that time, one in

the living room, another in the kitchen and the remaining one in a room.

While the members of the household were engaged in their work, someone

had knocked the main door. When questioned, they have stated its us,

and upon the opening of the door by PW-02, persons she has identified as

Sunil (the 1st appellant who was absconding at the time), Jayaweera, the 2nd

appellant and Seetha, the 5th appellant has come into the house. She has

also identified the 4th appellant Gunasiri and 3rd appellant Samantha as the

other persons who were present and came inside the house. As all of them

were well known to her, she has had no difficulty in identifying them. It was

her evidence that Jayaweera had a sword in his hand, and the 5th appellant

Seetha had a sharp pointed knife and the 3rd appellant took the ketti knife

which was in the kitchen. According to her, Gunasiri the 4th appellant had a

curved knife and others had ropes with them. Apart from the above-

mentioned persons there had been some others also present outside of the

house.

When they came into the house, the deceased had intervened and informed

them that if they have any issues, come in the morning and resolve them. At

that point, those who came in have pushed and dragged the deceased to the

nearby room and assaulted him and the 5th appellant has assaulted the PW-

02 as well. After the initial assault, the deceased had been dragged out of

the room and to the front garden of the house about 16 to 20 feet away from

the main front door, and had closed the front door. Thereafter, looking

outside through an opening in the upper part of the window she has

witnessed all the appellants attacking the deceased by cutting and stabbing

him, who was by then fallen near a clove tree. She has specially mentioned

the appellant Seetha as the person who climbed onto the stomach of the

deceased and stabbed him.

After they left the scene, she has come out of the house and had seen her

brother dead. It has been her other son who has informed the police of the

incident.

Page 6 of 16

It has been her evidence that after the appellants came into the house, they

extinguished two lamps that were lit at that time. She has explained that as

her house roof was removed at that time for repairs, through moon light and

the remaining lamp she was able to see what happened inside the house as

well as outside.

She has been the only eyewitness who has given evidence. PW-06 was the

District Medical Officer (DMO) who has conducted the postmortem (P-06

postmortem report) on the deceased. He has conducted the postmortem at

the scene of the crime on 30-09-1995. When he arrived at the scene, the

body of the deceased had been in a face down position. He has observed 48

cut and stab wounds on the body. Apart from the injuries he has observed

on the face and the hands, the majority of the injuries had been on the back

side of the deceased. Out of the 48 injuries, 30 had been cut injuries, and

the stab injuries had been on the back side of the body. He has opined that

these injuries have been caused within a short span of time and the death

had been due to the excessive bleeding from the injuries within a short span

of time.

At the conclusion of the prosecution case and when the appellants were

called for their defence, they have chosen only to make dock statements. All

of them have denied any involvement in the crime and has claimed that due

to an animosity they have been implicated in the crime.

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellants urged

the following common ground of appeal.

(1) The conviction was bad in law in view of the fact that there is a

doubt as to the identification.

Apart from the above, the rest of the grounds of appeal were as follows.

On behalf of the 1st appellant;

(2) The learned High Court Judge wrongly convicted the appellants on

all the counts against them, although the 3rd count should have

been considered as an alternative count.

Page 7 of 16

On behalf of the 2nd appellant;

(3) Section 27 statement should not have been allowed to be led in

evidence and it has caused prejudice to the appellant.

(4) The learned trial judge has failed to evaluate the part played by the

2nd appellant in the judgment, hence, no basis to sustain a

conviction on the basis of section 32 or 146 of the Penal Code.

On behalf of the 3rd and the 5th appellants;

(5) The credibility of the main witness PW-02 has not been considered

in the judgment.

On behalf of the 4th appellant;

(6) There was no evidence as to the common object for murder, nor

was there any evidence as to the participatory presence of the 4th

appellant.

(7) PW-02 did not witness the murder, as such she is an unreliable

witness.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

1st Ground of Appeal: -

The 5th and the 7th grounds of appeal will also be considered together with

the 1st ground of appeal as they are also interrelated to the 1st ground of

appeal raised based on the credibility of the witness PW-02 who was the

only eye witness gave evidence at the trial.

It was the strenuous argument of the learned Counsel that there was no

possibility for the PW-02 to identify the persons who came into the house

and what was happening outside. It was contended that according to the

evidence of PW-02, the persons who came into the house has extinguished

two lamps that were lit and her claim that she could observe what was

happening because of the moonlight was highly unreliable to depend on. It

was contended further, her evidence that once her brother was taken out of

Page 8 of 16

the house, she looked outside through an opening of the window louver was

also highly unreliable as she has failed to adequately explain how she was

able to see in that manner, given the height of the window louver from the

floor of the house. It was the position that even if she was able to look

outside of the house, she could not have seen what was happening as stated

by her, since it is not possible to believe that there was sufficient light. Her

evidence that she saw the 5th appellant stabbing the deceased by climbing

onto his stomach also cannot be accepted in view of the medical evidence, as

all the stab wounds have been on the back side of the deceased.

It is correct to argue that the positive identity of the persons who came and

attacked the deceased is a must to sustain a conviction against the

appellants given the facts and the circumstances of the case under appeal.

It was held in the case of Regina V. Turnbull and Another (1997) QB 224,

that in a case of this nature, where the identity is relevant;

That the judge should direct the jury to examine the circumstances in

which the identification by each witness can be made. Some of those

circumstances may include:

1. How long did the witness have the accused under observation?

2. At what light

3. At what distance

4. Was the observation impeded in any way

5. Have the witness ever seen the accused before

6. How often and any special reason for remembering the accused, etc.

I find that in the judgment, the learned High Court Judge has well

considered whether the evidence of the PW-02 that she was able to identify

the persons who came into the house and whether she was in a position to

Page 9 of 16

see what was happening outside of it, given the light conditions available at

the time of the incident.

It is evident that the persons who came into the house were well known to

her as a long-standing resident of the village, and they being her neighbours

and fellow villages. She has been very clear in her evidence that when they

initially came in, the house had three lamps lit and only after they came

inside the house two lamps were extinguished by the persons who came. It

would have been no difficulty for the PW-02 to identify the appellants the

moment they came in as they were known persons. It was her evidence that

apart from the lamps that were lit, as part of the roof of the house had been

removed at that time for repairs, sufficient moon light was also available

which enabled her to observe what was happening even after two lamps

were extinguished. I find that as a person who was well familiar with the

house and its surroundings and as a person well adapted to live with the

help of the light provided by lamps during the night, PW-02 was not lying.

As considered rightly by the learned High Court Judge, if there was no light

at all as claimed by the appellants there would have been no possibility for

those who came inside the house to find the person who was in the house

and assault him when he attempted to intervene and push him to a room.

And also, to drag him to the outside of the house after assaulting him

further.

It was the evidence of PW-02 that after her brother was dragged out of the

house by the appellants and closed the main door, she saw what was

happening by looking outside through a window louver. Under cross

examination, she has explained that it was about 8 feet from the floor and

that she may have climbed onto a chair or a stool to look outside.

I find that in her evidence PW-02 has not claimed that it was due to the full

moon she was able to see what was happening outside. What she has stated

was that the available moon light was sufficient for her to see what was

happening. Under cross examination, she has stated that she could see a

torch light too, and it was switched off while the attack was taking place.

Page 10 of 16

The argument that as to how PW-02 was able to reach the window louver

which was beyond her reach were sketchy and unreliable has no basis. The

witness under cross examination, when she was confronted with this

position, has correctly stated that she is not in a position to remember all

the details after 21 years.

It is well settled law that one cannot be expected to remember all the details

of an incident some long years after the event. What is important is that

whether the witness was speaking the truth about what happened and

whether the evidence was reliable enough as to the involvement of an

accused person or persons with regard to the crime.

At this stage it is appropriate to refer to the Indian case of Bhoginbhai

Hitijibhai Vs. State of Gujarat (AIR 1983-SC 753 at pp 756-758) where it

was held:

1) By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a

videotape is replayed on the mental screen.

2) Ordinarily, so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The

witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has

an element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be

expected to be attuned to absorb the details.

It is very much believable that PW-02 could see what was happening outside

just 15-20 feet away, with the available light from where she was. It was the

contention that she was lying when she said that the 5th appellant climbed

onto the stomach of the deceased and stabbed him as there were no stab

wounds on the frontal area of the deceased according to the DMOs

evidence. It is correct that there had been no stab wounds observed in the

frontal area of the body of the deceased. All the stab wounds have been in

the back of the body. That does not mean that PW-02 did not see what was

happening outside of her house. It would be the any reasonably prudent

persons instinct to find out in any manner possible when a loved one is

dragged out of a house after being assaulted.

Page 11 of 16

Although it was the contention that PW-02 could not have reached the

window louver which was about 8 feet from the floor, the evidence of PW-09

who was the police officer investigated the crime scene and observed the

scene of the crime, that it was only about 6 feet from the floor. This goes on

to establish that the PW-02 was telling the truth when she said that she was

able to look outside, but she is unable to remember how she reached the

window louver.

Her evidence is trustworthy and credible that she identified the appellants

when they came into the house and that they are the persons who dragged

the deceased out. I find that her evidence is credible that she saw what was

happening outside, and that it was the same persons who dragged her

brother out, who inflicted the fatal injuries to him. Given the fact that the

deceased had 48 cut and stab wounds on his body, it can be safely

presumed that it was not the work of a single individual, but by several as

the medical evidence has clearly established.

For the reasons adduced as above, I find no merit in the considered grounds

of appeal.

As the 2nd ground of appeal is a ground that needs to be considered last, I

would now proceed to consider the rest of the grounds of appeal.

3rd Ground of Appeal: -

The 3rd ground of appeal raised by the 2nd appellant was based on the

argument that the recovery made under the section 27 statement by the 2nd

appellant to the police was wrongly led and it has resulted in a prejudice to

him.

PW-08 who has recovered a torch based on the statement made by the 2nd

appellant to the police after his arrest has been marked through PW-07 as

the relevant PW-08 was dead. The fact that he was dead has not been

disputed at any stage of the trial. PW-07 has marked the extract of the

relevant portion of the statement made to PW-08 by the 2nd appellant under

the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance, which is legally permissible.

Page 12 of 16

Although the torch had been marked as a production, it has had no impact

on the evidence as the only eyewitness has clearly stated that she did not

see who carried a torch. It was her evidence that she only saw a torch light

outside of the house while her brother was cut and stabbed by the

appellants. The learned High Court Judge has clearly mentioned that in his

judgment and has not considered the evidence relating to the discovery of a

torch as relevant.

I am of the view that this has not in any way prejudiced the substantial

rights of any of the appellants for that matter, hence, no basis for the

contention.

4th and the 6th Grounds of Appeal: -

As the above grounds of appeal are grounds based on the proof of common

object under section 146 and the common intention under section 32 of the

Penal Code, the said grounds will be considered together.

It is settled law that once the common object of an unlawful assembly is

established, every member of the unlawful assembly is vicariously liable for

the actions of the members of that unlawful assembly.

In the case of Kulanthunga V. Mudalyhami 42 NLR 331, it was held that

the prosecution must prove that there was an unlawful assembly with a

common object as stated in the charge. So far as each individual is

concerned, it has to prove that he was a member of the assembly which he

intentionally joined and that he knew the common object of the assembly.

Dr. Gour in his book Penal Law of India discusses the law in respect of

unlawful assembly as follows; (Volume II page 1296 11th edition):

All persons who convened or who take part in proceedings of an

unlawful assembly are guilty of the offence of taking part in an

unlawful assembly. Persons present by accident or by curiosity alone

without taking any part in the proceedings are not guilty of the offence,

even though those persons possess the power of stopping the assembly

and failed to exercise it. Mere presence in an assembly does not make

Page 13 of 16

such a person a member of an unlawful assembly, unless it is shown

that he has done something or omitted to do something which would

make him a member of an unlawful assembly

On the other hand, in order to prove common intention under section 32 of

the Penal Code, the proof of every individuals part in the crime needs to be

established.

The evidence placed before the High Court has clearly established that the

2nd appellant was a member of the unlawful assembly that committed the

murder of the deceased from the very outset. PW-02 has clearly identified

him as one of the persons who entered the house, assaulted the deceased

and dragged him away. I do not find a basis to the argument that the

learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the part played by him

since the Learned High Court Judge has clearly considered what he was

doing and his part in the unlawful assembly. When it comes to the fourth

accused appellant, he was also a member of the group that came into the

house and attacked the deceased and he was one of the persons who

pushed the deceased into a room and later dragged him outside of the

house. It is the evidence that he also carried with him a curved knife at the

time of the incident. This amply establishes that the second and fourth

appellants were also an integral part of the unlawful assembly formed with

the common object of attacking the deceased.

In the case of The Queen V N.K.A. Appuhamy 62 NLR, 484 it was held

that:

(i) That a common object in an unlawful assembly is different from a

common intention, in that it does not require prior concert and a

common meeting of minds before the offence is committed. If each

member of the assembly has the same object, their object would be

common, and if there were five or more with this object, then they would

form an unlawful assembly without any prior concert among

themselves.

Page 14 of 16

(ii) That a person can become a member of an unlawful assembly not

only by the doing of a criminal act but also by lending the weight of his

presence and associating with a group of persons who are acting in a

criminal fashion.

(iii) That the common objects of an unlawful assembly may come in

succession and need not necessarily exist together at the beginning.

However, when it is coming to an offence committed with the common

intention (Section 32 of the Penal Code) it is the duty of the trial Judge to

see the part played by each of the accused in committing the offence.

Vicarious liability is not applicable for an offence committed with common

intention.

In the case of King Vs. Assappu 50 NLR 324 it was held that:

In a case where the question of common intention arises the Jury must be

directed that

(i) The case of each accused must be considered separately.

(ii) The accused must have been actuated by a common intention with the

doer of the act at the time the offence was committed.

(iii) Common intention must not be confused with the same or similar

intention entertained independently of each other.

(iv) There must be evidence, either direct or circumstantial, of

prearrangement or some other evidence of common intention.

(v) The mere fact of the presence of the accused at the time of the offence is

not necessarily evidence of common intention.

In the judgement it clearly appears that the Learned High Court Judge has

well considered the actions of each of the appellants to come to his findings

in determining that the offence committed by them also falls under Section

32 of the Penal Code.

For the reasons stated above, I find no merit in the considered grounds of

appeal.

Page 15 of 16

2nd Ground of Appeal: -

In the indictment against the appellants, apart from the first two counts,

which are counts based on unlawful assembly, the third count was based on

the premise that the appellants committed the murder of the deceased with

a common intention, punishable in terms of Section 296 read with Section

32 of the Penal Code.

I am in agreement with the contention of the Learned Counsel for the first

appellant that although it has not been mentioned in the indictment, the

third count should have been considered as an alternative count to the first

two counts. Although the learned High Court Judge has found sufficient

evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt all three counts preferred

against the appellants, I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge

should have considered the third count as an alternative to count two,

which was the count based on unlawful assembly punishable in terms of

296 read with Section 146 of the Penal Code.

Hence, it is my view that as there was sufficient evidence proven beyond

reasonable doubt to convict the appellants on the first and the second

count, there was no necessity for the learned High Court Judge to convict

the appellants on the third count after finding them guilty on the first and

the second count preferred against them.

Even if it was the determination that the third count was also proved beyond

reasonable doubt, there was no necessity to impose a punishment on the

third count as it may amount to punishing the appellants twice over for the

same offence of murder.

However, it needs to be noted that the Learned High Court Judge was

mindful of this fact since he has imposed the death sentence on the basis

that the appellants were found guilty for the second and third counts and

not on the basis of that they are two separate counts.

Therefore, I set aside the conviction of the accused appellants on the third

count which should have been considered as an alternate count to the

Page 16 of 16

second count preferred against them, and since they have been duly

convicted on the first and the second count.

Subject to the above variation to the conviction and the sentence, the appeal

is dismissed.
