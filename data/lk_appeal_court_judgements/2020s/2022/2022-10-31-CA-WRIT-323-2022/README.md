Supported and Decided on : 21.10.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

Heard learned Counsel for the Petitioner in support of this application and the learned

State Counsel who appears for the Respondents opposing this application.

The Petitioner in this application is seeking, inter alia, to quash the indictments marked

P17 to P20 filed in the High Court of Colombo by the Attorney General. In view of the

precedent established in several decided cases including Victor Ivan vs. Sarath Silva Attorney

General and others (1998) 1 Sri. L.R. 340, the decision to file an indictment can be reviewed

and the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General is not unfettered or unreviewable.

However, when challenging the decision of the Attorney General to prosecute an accused

or decide to serve an indictment, the review Court should examine carefully the grounds

of challenge.

In the Supreme Court case of Sarath de Abrew vs. Chanaka Iddamalgoda and others,

SC/FR/424/2015 SC minutes 11/01/2015, the Court has held that where the legislature

Page 4 of 6

has confided the power of the Attorney General to forward the indictment with a discretion

how it is to be used, it is beyond the power of Court to contest that discretion unless such

discretion has been exercised mala fide or with an ulterior motive or in excess of

jurisdiction.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner points out that the grounds of challenge raised by

the Petitioner are pleaded in paragraph 41 and 42 of the Petition of the Petitioner. In terms

of paragraph 42 of the Petition, the purported element of bias of the Attorney General and

also the alleged negligence by disregarding evidence have been mentioned as grounds for

review. Further, the purported negligence of the Attorney General by disregarding the

elements necessary to establish the offence of cheating has also been raised as a ground of

challenge. It is observed that all four impugned indictments have been served based on the

provisions of the Section 403 of the Penal Code.

Based on the circumstances of this case, this Court is of the view that none of the grounds

disclosed by the Petitioner are sufficient or adequate in order to establish mala fides or any

ulterior motive of the Attorney General; or to establish the fact that the Attorney General

has acted in excess of his jurisdiction.

According to Wade and Forsyth in Administrative Law, 11th Edition, at page 230 no

evidence takes its place as yet a further branch of the principle of ultra vires. The Petitioner

has no reliance on the said rule and anyhow has failed even to establish the basic

ingredients of no evidence rule. However, based on the pleadings and the documents

annexed to the Petition and also based on the submissions made by the learned Counsel,

this Court sees that no viable reason has been demonstrated to establish the fact that the

Page 5 of 6

Attorney General had not taken relevant material or had taken irrelevant material into

consideration in arriving at his decision to prosecute the Petitioner.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the Attorney General has failed, among

other grounds, to consider the payment plan that was divulged in the Commercial High

Court. This Court takes into serious consideration the remarks made by the Hon. High

Court Judge of the said Commercial High Court in his order marked P9 against the

Petitioner. We are of the view that such payment plan cannot be considered in the instant

application to undermine any kind of investigation on the criminal liability of the

Petitioner.

In the Attorney General vs. Sivapragasam 60 NLR 468, Sansony J. has observed that the

Crown is not interested in procuring a conviction. Its only interest is that the right person

should be convicted, that the truth should be known and the justice should be done.

The learned State Counsel vehemently objecting to the issuance of formal notice on the

Respondents draws the attention of this Court to the Fundamental Rights Application

bearing No. SCFR 25/2021 in which the Petitioner of this case was the 2nd Petitioner. The

learned State Counsel submits that the Petitioner has filed the said Fundamental Rights

Application based on the identical grounds as in the instant application and he refers to the

paragraph b and f of the prayer of the Petition of the said Fundamental Rights

Application. It is observed that the Petitioners in the said Fundamental Rights Application

have sought an order to stay the indictment against the Petitioners by the Attorney General

and also has sought for an order in reference to the decisions made by the Attorney General

in the Department file under reference No. CR 2/45/2017. The learned State Counsel

Page 6 of 6

further asserts that this file of the Attorney Generals Department is directly in reference to

the impugned indictments that were served on the Petitioner. It is important to note that

the Supreme Court has refused to grant leave to proceed in the said Fundamental Rights

Application.

In the circumstances, this Court is of the view that there is no reason to interfere into the

prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General in the instant application as there appears

that no blatant error was made by the Attorney General in his decisions and prima facie

no evidence is available to disclose that the Attorney General has exceeded his powers.

This Court has consistently dealt with arguability principles in a Judicial Review

application and held that the vitiating ground must be arguably material to the impugned

decision and such decision must be arguably amenable to judicial review (see- Jinadasa vs.

Weerasinghe 31 NLR 33 and Chief Rabbi ex. p. Wachmann (1993) 2 All ER 249).

In the circumstances, we proceed to refuse this application.
