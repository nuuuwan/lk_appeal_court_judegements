Decided on : 06.10.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner is currently serving as a Superintendent at the 1st Respondent, Janatha

Estate Development Board (JEDB) and is in-charge of the Deltota Estate situated at

Galaha. The Petitioners date of birth according to the available documents is 17.11.1964

and accordingly, he reached the age of 57 on 17.11.2021. The Board of Directors of the

JEDB has taken a decision to extend the services of the Petitioner by 6 months beyond the

age of 57 and send him on retirement by 16.05.2022. This decision of the JEDB was

communicated to the Petitioner by letter dated 10.12.2021, marked P3.

The Petitioner is seeking, inter alia, for a writ of Certiorari to quash the decision reflected

in the letter dated 10.12.2021, marked P3.

The Petitioners primary argument is that by the Public Enterprise Circular No. 01/2013

dated 15.01.2013, marked P4, the employees of the Public Enterprises have been granted

an option to serve up to the compulsory age of retirement, i.e., 60 years of age, without

seeking extensions. The Petitioner further asserts that he is now entitled to serve up to the

compulsory age of retirement, i.e., 62 years, without applying for an extension of service

as the above Circular was revoked by the Public Enterprise Circular 02/2021 dated

14.12.2021, marked P5.

As opposed to such argument, the Respondents raise the following arguments;

(i) the contract of employment between the Petitioner and the JEDB deals with

matters relating to the retirement age of the Petitioner,

(ii) the appointment and the termination of the Petitioner are purely governed by the

contract of employment and it has no statutory avail; thus, a writ of certiorari does

not lie upon the impugned decision P3 to retire the Petitioner at the age of 57

years after giving an extension for a period of 6 months;

Page 3 of 4

(iii) the PE Circular 02/2021 is not a statute and has not been issued under any

statutory provision or authority; thus, any act or omission under the said Circular

would not attract the remedy of a writ of Certiorari.

(iv) Even in pursuant to the new Circular marked P5, the JEDB is empowered under

Clause III therein to send the Petitioner on retirement upon the Petitioner

completing 57 years of age, with 6 months notice.

At the hearing stage of this application both parties conceded that the questions to be

determined in this application are identical to the questions in CA/Writ/04/2022. The

judgement in the said application in CA/Writ/04/2022 has been already delivered on the

same date of this judgement.

Based on the reasons given in CA/Writ/04/2022 and also considering all the

circumstances of this case, I apply the same conclusions arrived in the said

CA/Writ/04/2022 in this application as well. Accordingly, I hold that;

1. the PE Circular 01/2013 and PE Circular 02/2021 have the statutory flavour and

are issued under due authority to disseminate directions or the policy to which

certain Statutes give legal force.

2. the PE Circular 01/2013 and PE Circular 02/2021 should be applicable to JEDB

as it is a State-Owned Public Enterprise/ Statutory Board.

3. the reason that the JEDB has selectively and expressly adopted and/or applied PE

Circular 01/2013 in the said P3 is itself sufficient to reject the argument of the

Respondents that the PE Circular No. 02/2021 has not been issued under any

statutory provision.

4. the Respondents assertions that the appointment and the termination of the

Petitioner are purely governed by the contract of employment and it has no

statutory avail, should be rejected.

5. any act or omission, under the said PE Circular 01/2013 and/or PE Circular

02/2021, committed by the Respondents in pursuant to the terms of the contract

of employment are certainly reviewable by a Court exercising the jurisdiction of

Judicial Review.

6. in reference to Clause III of PE Circular 01/2013 and Clause III of PE Circular

02/2021, the Respondents have failed to demonstrate that they have conducted a

Page 4 of 4

reasonable inquiry and also carried out a proper assessment on the efficiency & the

performance of the Petitioner.

7. the impugned letter P3 which is based on PE Circular 01/2013 has become null

and void due to the mere reason that the said PE Circular 01/2013 has been

revoked before the decision reflected in P3 has been fully accomplished.

8. the said PE Circular 02/2021 is deemed to be the current law regulating the

retirement age of employees of Public Corporations, Boards etc.

Based on my above findings and also taking in to consideration all the circumstances of

this case, I proceed to issue a writ of certiorari as prayed for in paragraph (e) of the prayer

of the Petition.
