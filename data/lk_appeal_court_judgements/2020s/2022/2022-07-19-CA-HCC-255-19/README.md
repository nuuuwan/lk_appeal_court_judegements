The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Polonnaruwa

on the first count of possessing a T-56 automatic weapon, an offence

punishable under section 22(3) read with section 22(1) of the Fire Arms

Ordinance No. 33 of 1916 as amended by Act No. 22 of 1996; and on

the second count of possessing of 30 bullets, an offence punishable

under section 27(1)(a) read with section 9(2) of Explosives Act No. 21

of 1956 as amended by Amendment Acts No. 33 of 1969 and No. 18 of

2005. After the trial, the learned High Court Judge convicted the

appellant and imposed life imprisonment for the first count and a fine

of Rs. 15000/= with a default term of six months simple imprisonment

for the second count. This appeal is preferred against the said

convictions and sentences.

3

The facts of the case, according to the prosecution, may be briefly

summarized as follows:

On the day in question, around 6.30 a.m., the Chief Inspector of Police

Station, Hingurakgoda (PW-1) received information from a private

informant about a group of armed persons going for a robbery. He

arranged a raid and a group of police officers went with him to

Marasinghe estate on Medirigiriya road. The Elf lorry mentioned in

the information was searched by him and the other officers. The

appellant was seated in the front left with a dark blue colored bag.

When this bag was opened, there was a T-56 weapon and a magazine

with 30 bullets.

Both parties have tendered written submissions prior to the hearing of

the appeal. At the hearing, the learned counsel for the appellant

advanced his arguments on the following three grounds:

I. The learned trial Judge was in error when he failed to consider

the serious contradictions in the prosecution story.

II. The prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt the

chain of production.

III. The learned trial Judge has misdirected himself in law by failing

to evaluate the evidence of the prosecution and the defence in

the proper perspective.

Apart from the aforesaid grounds of appeal, the learned counsel for the

appellant pointed out that PW-1 stated in his evidence that the raid

was carried out after receiving information on 27.09.2010. However,

the learned counsel submitted that according to the charges, the

offences were committed on 28.09.2010, and thus it was not proved

that the offences were committed on the date mentioned in the

charges.

4

However, it is apparent that it is only a mistake because PW-1 stated

in cross-examination that the accused-appellant was arrested on

28.09.2010 at 11.50 hours. (The said answer of PW-1 is found on page

57 of the appeal brief). In addition, PW-20 who went for the raid has

also explained that the raid was carried out on 28.09.2010 (Page 193

of the appeal brief). Therefore, the date of the raid is not an issue and

no prejudice is caused to the appellant as a result of the above mistake.

The learned counsel for the appellant has brought to the notice of the

court a vital discrepancy. PW-1 stated that the serial number of the

T-56 weapon purported to be recovered from the appellant is

No. 28032467 (Page 48 of the appeal brief). PW-1 stated on another

occasion that the serial number mentioned in the notes is 38032467

(Page 50 of the appeal brief). In fact, on the same page, in response to

a question, PW1 stated correctly that the serial number mentioned in

the notes is 28032467. Only when the learned state counsel who

prosecuted the case asked whether the number mentioned in the notes

is 38032467, PW-1 answered in the affirmative. Apart from that, the

government analyst has stated, in one instance, that the serial number

of the weapon is 18032467. (Page 88 of the appeal brief). Here also,

only the first digit of the serial number differs. However, this is a

discrepancy that should be carefully examined because the serial

number is the best method of identifying a gun. Also, if the gun

examined by the Government Analyst does not have the same serial

number as the gun allegedly recovered from the appellant, the first

charge cannot be proved.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General contended that there could be a

typographical error or mistake of this nature, but these numbers are

correctly noted in documents and since the documents are tallied,

there would be no issue in identifying the gun. He submitted further,

5

that only on aforesaid occasions, the first digit of the number differs,

but on all other occasions, witnesses have stated the number correctly

as 28032467 and that number appears correctly in all relevant

documents. I agree with the contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor

General because even the Government Analyst has stated in his

evidence found on page 80 of the appeal brief that he observed the

number as 28032467 and made notes. In addition, in the Government

Analyst Report dated 18.07.2012, the serial number of the T-56 gun

that he received was mentioned as 28032467. In addition, the same

number appears in the property receipt (PR document is found at page

354 of the appeal brief) produced in this case. This court perused the

notes in the police information book to ensure the correctness of the

number. (The said notes are attached to the appeal brief and found at

page 700) From the said notes also, it is apparent that the serial

number of the gun recovered from the appellant is 28032467.

Therefore, there is no reasonable doubt regarding the identity of the T-

56 gun recovered from the appellant.

The learned counsel for the appellant pointed out that according to

PW-1, the main investigating officer; only one magazine and 30 bullets

were found with the T-56 gun. However, according to PW-5, two T-56

guns and two magazines were recovered during the raid. The learned

counsel for the appellant added that the Government Analyst has

stated that he received a magazine with 30 bullets and another

magazine with 19 bullets. Therefore, the learned counsel for the

appellant contended that the said contradiction casts serious doubt as

to what articles were recovered during the raid.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted in reply that since the

other magazine and 19 bullets were not relevant to this case, PW-1 has

not given evidence regarding those items recovered. It is to be noted

that according to the property receipt (PR) No.13/10 pertaining to this

6

case, only the magazine with 30 bullets has been mentioned.

Therefore, it is apparent that PW-1 has given evidence only with regard

to the items pertaining to this case. The Government Analyst has

stated about the other magazine with 19 bullets because he received

the said production marked as P7 also with the productions of this

case. In the Government Analyst Report, it is clearly mentioned that a

magazine with 19 bullets was received as the production marked P7.

This is also apparent from the contents of the affidavit marked P5

found at page 471 of the appeal brief. PW-1 tendered this affidavit to

the Magistrate Court of Hingurakgoda in order to send the productions

to the Government Analyst. According to the affidavit, the magazine

with 19 bullets was marked as P7, and what was recovered from the

accused-appellant was a T-56 gun and a magazine with 30 bullets. It

is specifically stated in the said affidavit that the other T-56 gun and

a magazine with 19 bullets were recovered from the custody of one

Nimal Weerasekera, who was held in custody on detention orders.

Therefore, it is obvious since the other magazine was recovered from

the custody of an accused in another case, PW-1 has not stated

regarding those productions that were not relevant to this case.

However, since the Government Analyst received all the productions,

he has mentioned about those productions as well in his report.

Anyhow, it is precisely clear from the Government Analyst Report that

the other magazine had been sent as the production marked P7.

Hence, it is evident that the other magazine has also been recovered in

this raid from another person but is not relevant to this case.

Another discrepancy that was shown by the learned counsel for the

appellant was that according to the evidence of PW-1, three persons

were in the front of the lorry and two persons were at the rear.

However, the learned counsel pointed out that according to PW-2, eight

suspects were arrested and produced in the Magistrate Court.

Therefore, the learned counsel contended, it is clear that the

7

prosecution has not presented the true story of this case. The learned

Deputy Solicitor General explained how eight suspects were produced

in court. PW-2 who spoke about eight suspects did not participate in

the raid. He stated about producing the suspects to court. Apart from

the five suspects including the accused in this case arrested at the

time of the raid, three other suspects were arrested subsequently and

all eight suspects have been produced in court under B report bearing

number 921/10 on the 30. 09.2010. Prosecution witnesses number 5

and 20 who participated in the raid have stated in their evidence that

there were five suspects in the lorry, three persons in front including

the driver, and two persons in the back. Therefore, it is apparent that

there was no contradiction regarding the number of suspects arrested

at the initial stage of the raid.

Another discrepancy that was shown by the learned counsel for the

appellant was that, according to the PW-1, once the lorry was stopped,

a bag was on the legs of the appellant, who was seated on the left side

of the front seat. But according to the PW-20, the bag was near the

legs of the appellant. As far as I see, it is a minor discrepancy that does

not go to the root of the case because if the bag was on the toes of the

appellant, it can be stated, as stated by PW-1 that

. When the bag was in that position, one can

also state, as stated by PW-20 that

. Therefore, that is not a

discrepancy that creates a reasonable doubt about the prosecution

story.

The learned counsel for the appellant advanced another argument

that, according to the evidence in chief of PW-1, there was a magazine

and 30 bullets in the bag. The magazine was not loaded into the gun

and the bullets were also not loaded into the gun. However, he pointed

out that in cross-examination PW-1 has stated that bullets were loaded

8

into the gun. When the aforementioned two instances (found on pages

53 and 61 of the appeal brief) are considered, it cannot be determined

conclusively that PW-1 has taken contradictory positions because,

when the magazine in which the bullets were loaded had been removed

from the gun, he may have said that the bullets were not loaded.

Therefore, there is no apparent contradiction to be considered.

The learned counsel for the appellant also pointed out as a

contradiction that PW-1 has stated that the appellant was arrested at

11.30 hours, in cross-examination he said that the appellant was

arrested at 11.50 hours, and PW-20 has stated that the appellant was

arrested around 10.30-10.45. In stating the time, it is clear that

PW-20 has not perused the notes. That is why he stated 10.45 , 10.30

. Also, there is only a slight difference between the times

mentioned by PW1. Minor discrepancies of this nature do not affect

the credibility of the witnesses or the prosecution case. It is to be noted

that in the case of The Attorney General V. Sandanam Pitchi Mary

Theresa S.C. Appeal No. 79/2008, decided on 06.05.2010, it was

observed that Police officers are not infallible observers and may, like

any other witness, make honest mistakes.

In addition, in the case of Sunil vs. The Attorney General (1999) 3 Sri

LR 191, it was observed that the Court must not be unmindful of the

fact that they are human witnesses and it is a hallmark of human

testimony that such evidence is replete with mistakes, inaccuracies, and

misstatements. Also, it is stated in this judgment that the court has to

be equally mindful of the fact that the evidence tendered by human

testimony will suffer from certain deficiencies and defects. It is in this

light that Justice Cannon in Attorney General v. Visuavalingam - 47 NLR

286 emphasized that no prudent and wise Judge would disregard

testimony for the mere proof a contradiction but that a wise Judge

should critically assess and evaluate the contradiction. He emphasized

9

the Judge must give his mind to the issues what contradictions are

material in discrediting the testimony of a witness.

The observations made in State of Uttar Pradesh v. Anthony - 1985

AIR SC 48 are cited in the aforesaid case of Sunil v. Attorney General

in the following way. "The danger of disbelieving an otherwise truthful

witness on account of trifling contradictions has been spotlighted. The

Indian Judge observed that the witness should not be disbelieved on

account of trivial discrepancies, especially where it is established that

there is substantial reproduction in the testimony of the witness in

relation to his evidence before the Magistrate or in the session Court and

that minor variation in language used by witness should not justify the

total rejection of his evidence".

Also, it was held in Bandara V. The State- (2001) 2 Sri L.R 63 that

discrepancies and inconsistencies which do not relate to the core of the

prosecution case, ought to be disregarded especially when all

probabilities factor echoes in favour of the version narrated by a

witness.

In Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai V. State of Gujarat AIR 1983 SC 753, The

Indian Supreme Court held as follows:

By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape

is replayed on the mental screen. Ordinarily, it so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The

witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has

an element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be

expected to be attuned to absorb the details. The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one may

notice, another may not. An object or movement might emboss its image

10

on one persons mind, whereas it might go unnoticed on the part of

another.

Ordinarily, a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the

sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short

time span. A witness is liable to get confused or mixed up when

interrogated later on.

The aforesaid portion of the Indian Supreme Court Judgment is cited

in the case of A.K. Kamal Rasika Amarasinghe V. OIC Special

Investigation Unit and Hon. Attorney General - SC Appeal

No.140/2010 Special Leave to Appeal No.118/10, decided on

18.07.2018.

In considering the aforesaid circumstances with the decisions and

observations of the aforesaid judicial authorities, I hold that the

learned High Court Judge has correctly assessed and evaluated the

contradictions in this case and held that those contradictions have not

affected the credibility of the prosecution case. For the reasons stated

above, the appeal would not succeed on the first ground of appeal.

The learned counsel for the appellant advanced the argument that the

chain of production had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt,

by drawing attention to the fact that Amila Wijesekera who had

accepted productions from the Hingurakgoda Magistrate Court was

not called in evidence. It is to be noted that the necessity of calling

witnesses to establish the chain of production is to ensure that the

productions taken from the custody of the accused-appellant have in

fact been forwarded to the Government Analyst. There is no dispute on

the facts that PW-1 requested from the Magistrate Court by way of an

affidavit marked P5 to send the productions to the Government

Analyst, after the relevant productions have been handed over to the

Magistrate Court. PW-8, P.S. 25608 then took the productions and

handed them over to the Government Analyst. A memorandum issued

11

by the Government Analyst proves that PW-8 handed over the

productions to the Government Analyst Department. PW-8s evidence

on taking the productions from the Hingurakgoda Magistrate Court

and handing them over to the Government Analyst has not been

challenged in cross-examination. Hence, no reasonable doubt would

be cast on the chain of production. Accordingly, the second ground of

appeal would fail.

The learned High Court Judge has evaluated the prosecution evidence

and stated his findings in the Judgment with reasons. In this

Judgment, it was discussed and found that the contradictions and the

deficiencies pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant do not

create a reasonable doubt about the prosecution case. In addition, the

learned Judge has evaluated how the ingredients of the charges have

been proved by the prosecution evidence. Hence, it appears that the

learned High Court Judge has properly evaluated the prosecution

evidence.

The learned counsel for the appellant contended, citing the relevant

judicial authorities, that the dock statement of the appellant and the

defence evidence had not been considered by the learned trial Judge.

In paragraph one of the Judgment, on page 11, the learned High Court

Judge analyzed the defence version. Although the analysis is brief, as

the learned Deputy Solicitor General pointed out, it appears that the

entire defence version has been considered by the learned Judge in

this analysis. It would be preferable if the conclusion regarding the

defence case was set out in the Judgment with more reasoning, but I

agree with the learned High Court Judge's conclusion of not accepting

the defence version in light of all of the evidence presented in this case.

Therefore, I am not inclined to agree with the contention that the

evidence in the case has not been evaluated in the proper perspective

12

by the learned High Court Judge. Accordingly, the third ground of

appeal would also not succeed.

In the circumstances, I find no reason to interfere with the Judgment

of the learned High Court Judge. Accordingly, the Judgment dated

19.09.2019, conviction, and sentence are affirmed.

The appeal is dismissed.
