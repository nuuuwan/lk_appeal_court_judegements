Order

The application of the Petitioner Hewawasam Thuduwawaththage Susil Priyashantha

was supported on 10.10.2022. Petitioner sought an interim order to stay the execution

of the Judgment dated 26.07.2022 delivered by the learned High Court Judge of Galle

Page 4 of 6

in case bearing No. RE/483/2019 and any further proceedings before the learned

Magistrate of Galle in case bearing No. 95610

It appears that the said Petitioner is not a party to the said Magistrates Court case or

the High Court case. However, it was averred in the petition that he was advised as

being entitled in law to make this application to this Court in terms of Article 138 (1)

of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist republic of Sri Lanka.

However, the Petitioner states that on or about 22.09.2022, Loza Hanna Volodymyrivna

appointed him as her Power of Attorney holder to effectively superintend, manage and

control the subject matter in the said case bearing No. 95610 and to appear on behalf

of her before the Magistrates Court, District Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court

of Sri Lanka by a Power of Attorney attested in Ukraine on or about 22.09.2022.

The original Power of Attorney was not presented to Court due to the stoppage of

transportation and delivery between Ukraine and Sri Lanka, and a scanned copy of the

Power of Attorney had been tendered to Court. It is seen that the said Loza Hanna

Volodymyrivna, the Principal of the Power of Attorney was not a party to the said

Magistrates Court case and the High Court case.

The Complainant had filed information on 16.08.2018 in the Magistrates Court of Galle

in case bearing No. 95610 in terms of Section 66 (1) (a) of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act No. 44 of 1979 making the 1st named of the party of the 1st Part Respondents namely,

Hewawasam Jayakodige Priyantha and Thumbe Gamage Deepa Priyani and the party of

the 2nd Part Respondent-Respondents namely, Olexander Kobet and Roman Kusumenko

as parties.

After parties filed affidavits, counter affidavits and written submissions, the learned

Magistrate delivered the Order on 05.04.2019 deciding that the Petitioner-Respondents

were unable to prove the fact that they were forcibly dispossessed from the premises

in dispute within a period of 2 months immediately before the date on which the

information was filed and that the 1st named of the party of the 2nd Part Respondent-

Page 5 of 6

Respondent namely, Olexander Kobet is entitled to the possession of the land in

dispute.

The learned Magistrate has directed the Petitioner-Respondents to handover the vacant

and peaceful possession of the premises in dispute to the said 1st named of the party of

the 2nd Part Respondent-Respondent.

Being aggrieved by the said Order dated 05.04.2019, the Respondent-Respondent

invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court of Galle. After objections were

filed by the 1st named of the party of the 2nd Part Respondent-Respondent namely,

Olexander Kobet, the Petitioner-Respondents tendered their written submissions and

the matter was argued before the High Court of Galle.

It appears that after considering the oral and written submissions made by both parties,

the learned High Court Judge delivered the Order on or about 26.07.2022 in favour of

the Petitioner-Respondents by setting aside the Order of the learned Magistrate of Galle

dated 26.07.2022.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned High Court Judge, the Petitioner, on

behalf of the Principal of the Power of Attorney holder Loza Hanna Volodymyrivna, has

invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court.

In this instance, Court observes that, the said Loza Hanna Volodymyrivna was not a

party in the said Magistrates Court case or the High Court case of Galle. This is an

application emanating from the Order of the learned High Court Judge setting aside the

Order made by the leaned Magistrate in terms of Section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act.

Legislature in its wisdom has introduced Part VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act

vesting jurisdiction in terms of Section 66 to prevent a breach of the peace threatened

or likely to be threatened among the parties and to preserve the status quo.

It is significant to note that the Principal of the Power of Attorney holder Loza Hanna

Volodymyrivna was not a party in the Magistrates Court case and was not involved in

Page 6 of 6

the dispute which led the jurisdiction of Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act to be invoked.

Therefore, the said Principal of the Power of Attorney has no locus standi to make this

application by way of a revision to get any relief prayed for in the prayer to the petition.

Hence, we dismiss this application in limine with costs.

I agree.
