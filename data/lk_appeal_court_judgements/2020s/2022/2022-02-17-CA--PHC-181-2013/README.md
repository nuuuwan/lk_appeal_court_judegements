Judgment

The Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station Borella being the Complainant, had filed information

on 16.05.2012 at the Magistrates Court of Colombo, in terms of Section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, in case bearing No. 5749/02/2012.

When this matter was mentioned in Court on 16.05.2012, the learned Magistrate acting as the

Primary Court Judge, and being of the view that there is a threat to peace or is likely, directed to

affix notices on the premises in question. On 03.10.2012, Court allowed the application of the

Intervenient Party to intervene in the instant case as an Intervenient Respondent.

Parties filed their affidavits, counter affidavits, documents and after the written submissions were

filed, the learned Primary Court Judge delivered the Order on the 20.03.2013 and held inter alia;

i. It is evident from the evidence of this case that the Respondent has fixed a gate on

09.02.2012 and they have demolished the garage and fixed a new padlock to the house on

the same date;

ii. Since the Respondents have not given the keys of the newly established gate to the

Petitioner and his wife as agreed on 19.09.2012, it cannot be believed that the Petitioner

and his wife were residing in the questioned premises from 09.02.2012 to 05.04.2012;

iii. The Petitioner and his wife have failed to produce evidence to prove their possession to

the questioned premises within a period of two months immediately before the date on

which the information was filed under Section 66;

iv. The Respondents also have not produced sufficient evidence to prove their possession to

the questioned premises;

v. Therefore, the possession of the questioned premises will not be given to any of the parties

of this case.

Page 6 of 17

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the 1st Party-1st Respondent-Petitioner had invoked the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Colombo by petition dated 05.03.2013.

After supporting the said application, the learned Primary Court Judge reserved the Order for

16.12.2013 and delivered the Order refusing to issue notice on the Respondents stating that there

were no sufficient grounds to issue notice and thereafter dismissed the said application. Being

aggrieved by the Order of the learned High Court Judge, the 1st Party-1st Respondent-Petitioner

Appellant [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant] had preferred this appeal.

In the instant case, it is observed that the learned Primary Court Judge had not given possession of

the disputed premises to any of the parties. It is relevant to note that the 2nd Party-Respondent-

Respondents and the Intervenient Respondent-Respondent had not made any application to the

High Court to revise or set aside the impugned Order of the learned Primary Court Judge.

Despite the 2nd Party-Respondent-Respondents being served notice through the Fiscal of the

District Court of Colombo, had not participated in this appeal. Moreover, the notices issued on the

other Respondents were returned undelivered due to unavoidable circumstances. However, it is

apparent that the 2nd Party Respondent-Respondents and the Intervenient Respondent-Respondent

had not shown due diligence in participating in this appeal.

It appears that the learned Primary Court Judge has dealt with Section 68 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act and had decided that no one is entitled to the possession of the disputed premises

and had not given possession of the disputed premises to either of the parties on the ground that

the 1st Party-1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant had failed to prove that he was in possession of

the disputed premises two months prior to the date on which the information was filed on

16.05.2012.

In terms of Section 72 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, a determination has to be made under

Section 68 or 69 of the Act, after examining and considering the following;

a) The information filed and the affidavits and documents filed,

Page 7 of 17

b) Such other evidence on any matter arising on the affidavits, or documents furnished that

Court may permit to lead on that matter and,

c) Such oral or written submissions as may be permitted by the Judge of the Primary Court at

his discretion.

It is to be observed in the instant case, that the Appellant claimed possession of the disputed

premises by his affidavit [P7] dated 31.10.2012. Although the 2nd Party-Respondents had not

claimed possession of the disputed premises by their affidavits dated 17.10.2012, they claimed

possession of the premises in dispute by their counter affidavits [P11A and P11B] dated

17.12.2012 and 17.12.2012. The Intervenient Respondent also claimed possession of the disputed

premises by his affidavit [P9] dated 04.09.2012.

It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that the Appellant and his wife had stated in their

affidavits with the documents marked 11 to 123 that, the Appellant and his wife (1st Party-

Respondents) were in continuous possession of the disputed premises, bearing assessment No.

1038/5, Maradana Road, Borella, which is depicted in plan bearing No. 1018, prepared by

Licensed Surveyor S.D. Ediriwickrama, marked and produced as 110, for more than 32 years by

residing and running a garage, where the premises had been clearly/separately shown in document

marked 111.

Based on the complaint made by the Appellant to the Police, the case bearing No: 753/02/2012,

which had been instituted in the Primary Court, the 2nd Party Respondents tried to fix a gate at the

entrance of the premises blocking the entrance of the Appellants business. Even though it had

been directed to the parties in the aforesaid case, not to make any alteration to the premises until

the determination of the case, the 2nd Party-Respondents confined the 1st Party-2nd Respondent and

her daughter (Appellants wife and daughter) in the questioned premises on 09.02.2012 by locking

the gate.

Thereafter the 2nd Party-Respondents with the support of the Intervenient Party had demolished

the garage of the Appellant and fixed a new padlock to the house of the Petitioner since the

Petitioner was not at the premises at the said time.

Page 8 of 17

As a result of the said demolition, it was impossible for the Appellant and his wife to reside in the

questioned premises permanently. However, since there was no legal bar to continue the garage,

the Appellant and his workers removed the aforesaid new padlock and had continued his business

in the premises in dispute of this Appeal.

Paragraph 19 of the affidavit [P11A] of the 2nd Party-Respondent-Respondents states;

.

On or about 05.04.2012, while the Appellant and one of his workers named Hettiarachchige Don

Dharmadasa were working at the garage, they were assaulted and ejected from the premises

forcibly by the 2nd Party-2nd Respondent -John De Silva, his wife and two other persons at about

3.00 p.m.;

(11)

05.04.2012 3.00

.

It is pertinent to note that the 2nd Party had not sought possession by their affidavit, and they had

not annexed any of the documents with their affidavit. The 2nd Party-2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents

had filed one counter affidavit [P11A] dated 17.10.2017 and the 2nd Party-1st Respondent had filed

another counter affidavit [P11B] dated 17.12.2012. According to the counter affidavit [P11A] filed

by the 2nd Party-2nd, 3rd, and 4th Respondents, Intervenient Party had possessed the premises by

way of a lease (Replying to paragraph 19 of the affidavit of the 1st Party). It states that;

1038/5

1 6958 .

Page 9 of 17

However, by that counter affidavit, the 2nd Party-2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents sought the possession

of the disputed premises by the prayer; which is as follows;

5749/2/2012 1038/5

..

The 2nd Party-1st Respondent had not sought the possession of the said premises by his counter

affidavit. It is worthy to note that neither 2nd Party-2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents nor the 2nd Party-

1st Respondent had filed any document to prove their possession to the premises in dispute.

The 1st information pertaining to the instant Primary Court case was filed on 16.05.2012 and on

the same date, it was ordered by the learned Primary Court Judge to affix notices on the premises.

By 20.06.2012, the Fiscal had affixed the notice on the premises and had reported the same to the

Primary Court. Even though the case was called four times i.e. on 04.07.2012, 18.07.2012,

08.07.2012, 21.08.2012 to file affidavits, no one made an application to intervene in the matter.

However, on 04.09.2012, when the case was called to file affidavits, the Intervenient Party made

an application before Court to intervene in the matter. Thereafter, having considered objections

raised by the parties, the learned Primary Court Judge allowed the intervention on 03.10.2012.

The Intervenient Party had stated in his affidavit [P9], that he was the lessee of the deceased

Appellant to the said premises during the period of 03.10.2011 to 02.10.2012, and had claimed

possession of the disputed premises. The Intervenient Party had marked and produced a copy of

the said lease agreement as 1 and according to the said agreement, the lessor of the said

premises was the deceased Appellant.

The attention of Court was drawn to the counter affidavits filed by the 2nd Party-2nd, 3rd and 4th

Respondents. Although they sought possession of the premises, neither 2nd Party-1st, 2nd, 3rd and

4th Respondent-Respondents nor the Intervenient Respondent-Respondent possessed the premises

in question and/or held dominium over the premises in question. Furthermore, it was stated by the

2nd Party-Respondents that the Appellant had leased out the said premises to the Intervenient Party.

Hence, it appears that the 2nd Party-Respondents had admitted the dominium of the deceased

Appellant over the premises in dispute.

Page 10 of 17

The counter affidavit [P11B] of the 2nd Party-1st Respondent states;

... 30.09.2011

663 ,

.

.

2 .

It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that the 2nd Party had no right of possession related to

the premises in dispute according to the averments contained in their counter affidavits. Similarly,

the Appellant alleges that the Intervenient Party-Respondent is also not entitled to possess the

premises in dispute and denied the same.

It was pointed out by the Appellant that the Intervenient Party had made an application before the

Primary Court to intervene in the matter about two and half months after notices of the instant case

were affixed. It is observed that if the Intervenient Party was in possession of the disputed

premises, he should have and could have made an application to intervene in the matter in the first

instance after notices were affixed on the premises in dispute.

The Court draws the attention to the lease agreement [1] executed between the deceased

Appellant and the Intervenient Respondent. According to the schedule of the said lease agreement,

the extent in the corpus is 10.5 perches. However, the lessor has agreed to lease out only 5.0

perches, and not the entire 10.5 perches. Therefore, it is pertinent to note that at the time of

executing the said lease agreement [1] on 30.09.2011, possession of the entire 10.5 perches was

with the deceased Appellant. Even when assuming 5.0 perches of the corpus had been leased out

to the Intervenient Respondent-Respondent, the remaining 5.5 perches has to be in the possession

of the deceased Appellant. Hence, Court has to clarify on what basis the learned Primary Court

Judge determined that the deceased Appellant is not entitled to the possession of the premises in

dispute.

Page 11 of 17

It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that 5.0 perches of the premises in dispute was leased

out to the Intervenient Respondent for the purpose of setting up and carrying on the business of a

car sale. It is imperative to note that the Intervenient Party had entered into the said lease agreement

[1] with effect from 13.10.2011 for a period of one year. The Intervenient Party Respondent

had made the application to intervene in the instant Primary Court case only on 04.09.2012, when

there was only a little more than a month left to complete the said lease period.

Although the Appellant had admitted the execution of the said lease agreement with the

Intervenient Respondent, Appellant had stated in his counter affidavit that he had not given the

possession of the 5.0 perch block of land to the Intervenient Respondent. Furthermore, after

executing the said lease agreement, the Intervenient Respondent never came to the disputed

premises to demarcate the 5.0 perches, the leased portion of land, and the Appellant had been in

possession of the entire 10.5 perch land on the disputed premises, until he was forcibly

dispossessed on 05.04.2012.

The Appellants said position is established by the investigation notes made by Sub-Inspector

Priyadharshana, the Investigating officer of the Police Station- Borella. The Police officer had not

mentioned about a car sale, which clearly shows that the Intervenient Respondent was not in

possession of the said premises.

It is important to reiterate the investigation notes made by the Police officer on 03.05.2012;

The learned Primary Court Judge had stated in her Order that it is hard to believe the 1st Party

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant and his wife were residing in the disputed premises, after a gate

was fixed on 09.02.2012 by the 2nd Party-Respondent-Respondents, since the keys of the said gate

had not been handed over to the deceased Appellant as agreed between the parties. However, the

2nd Party-1st Respondent had admitted in his statement to the Police dated 12.05.2012 that the

Petitioner (deceased Appellant) had entered to the questioned premises even after the gate was

fixed on 09.02.2012.

The 2nd Party-Respondent-Respondent, Thotawattage Don Manuel Subhash de Silva made a

statement to the Borella Police on 12.05.2012 which states that;

753/12 ,

.

Therefore, it is clear that the learned Primary Court Judge had come to the conclusion that the 1st

Party-Respondent-Petitioner Appellants had been in possession of the disputed premises even after

09.02.2012.

It is to be noted that the Intervenient Party had entered into the said lease agreement [1] with

effect from 03.10.2011 for a period of one year and the Police officer had inspected the premises

in dispute pertaining to the lease agreement on 03.05.2012, 7th month from the effective date of

the lease agreement. Therefore, according to the observation notes, it amply proves that the

Appellant had not given possession of 5.0 perches from the disputed premises to the Intervenient

Respondent, since there was no business of a car sale.

The Court draws the attention to the affidavit dated 07.08.2012 of the 1st Party-Respondents placed

before the learned Primary Court Judge. Upon the complaint made by the 1st Party-Respondent

(deceased Appellant) on 18.02.2013 to the Police Station- Borella regarding an obstruction of road

access to enter to the premises bearing No. 1038/5 [the disputed premises in this appeal] by fixing

a gate, the Officer-in-Charge had filed an information on 18.02.2013 in terms of Section 66 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act in case bearing No. 753/2/2012.

Page 13 of 17

Even after institution of the said case, the 1st Party-2nd Respondent had made a complaint [13] to

the Police Station- Borella on 09.02.2012 and the 1st Party-1st Respondent (deceased Appellant)

also made a complaint [14] on the same day evening to the Police Station- Borella. It is to be

noted that another complaint [P4] was made by the 1st Party-2nd Respondent on 11.02.2012 to the

Police Station- Borella, complaining that the 2nd Party-1st Respondent had threatened their lives.

Since the Police- Borella had not taken any action with regard to the aforesaid complaints made

by the 1st Party-Respondents, they had made an appeal to the Senior Deputy Inspector General of

the Colombo Crime Division.

Consequent to the said the appeal, the matter was referred to the Officer-in-Charge of Colombo

Crime Division-Dematagoda to inquire into the said complaints of the 1st Party-Respondents.

Thereafter, an officer of the Colombo Crime Division had warned the 1st Party-Respondents not

to interfere with the business activities of the 1st Party-Respondent and advised them to institute

an action in the District Court to get their rights and ownership to the disputed premises.

However, on 05.04.2012, 2nd Party-1st Respondent and two others had come to the said premises

and had assaulted the 1st Party-1st Respondent (deceased Appellant) and his employee H.D.

Dharmadasa and chased them out from the premises in dispute. The said 1st Party-1st Respondent

and his employee H.D. Dharmadasa had complained [P6A] about the said incident to the Police

Station-Borella on the same day. Since no action had been taken by the Borella Police, the 1st

Party-1st Respondent (deceased Appellant) had made another complaint on 02.05.2012 to the

Police Station- Borella.

In this complaint it was stated that consequent to the complaint dated 05.04.2012, persons who

assaulted them had been arrested. It appears that the Police investigated to the matter on 03.05.2012

and recorded statements from the 2nd Party-Respondent-Respondents. Subsequently, the Officer-

in-Charge of the Police Station- Borella had filed an information, pursuant to the complaint dated

02.05.2012, on 16.05.2012 in terms of the Primary Courts Procedure Act in the instant case. It is

observed that, the said information does not refer to the complaints dated 05.04.2012 and

02.05.2012, instead refers to the incident that took place on 10.02.2012, which is pertaining to the

information filed by Borella Police in the Magistrates Court of Colombo bearing No. 753/2/2012.

Page 14 of 17

Therefore, it is apparent that the Police had not properly reported facts to the learned Primary Court

Judge, especially with regard to the date of dispossession of the 1st Party-Respondents from the

premises in dispute.

It is worthy to note the;

The date of eviction- 05.04.2012

The date of complaint- 05.04.2012

The date the information was filed- 16.05.2012

According to the information filed on 16.05.2012 of the instant case, the date of eviction is

10.02.2012. Thus, it is needless to say that the information was filed out of time. In terms of Section

68 (1) of the Act, information should have been filed within two months of the date of complaint.

It is clear that the Police have deliberately referred to the date of dispossession as 10.02.2012, to

file the information out of time. Therefore, the Court is of the view that the act of the Police should

not be held against the Complainant when the Complainant invoked the jurisdiction under Section

66 (1) (a) (i) of the Act as the Complainant expected Police also to act according to Law. Section

66 (1) (a) (i) enunciates that, the Police shall with the least possible delay file an information and

failure to adhere to the provisions in Section 66 (1) (a) (i) should not be held against the

Complainant-Aggrieved Party.

In the case Sharif and others Vs. Wickramasuriya and others [2010] 1 SLR 255, Eric Basnayake

J. in a similar situation, made an Order directing the learned Judge to issue a writ of possession

forthwith to repair the injustice caused to the Petitioner.

The employee of the Appellant namely Hettiarachchige Don Dharmadasa had given an affidavit

marked and produced as 122, submitted with the affidavit of the 1st Party-Respondent-Appellants

which states;

Paragraph 2- 5749/02/2012

1038/5, ,

.

Page 15 of 17

Paragraph 4- 2007 10.02.2012

, 05.04.2012

.

Paragraph 7- 1 6958

2012 05

.

Paragraph 8-

, 05.04.2012

.

According to the said affidavit of the workman [122], it corroborates the version of the 1st Party-

1st Respondent-Petitioner-(deceased Appellant) that they had been in possession of the disputed

premises bearing No. 1038/5, Maradana Road, Borella until 05.04.2012.

The said deceased Appellant, Maththaka Jinadasa Gamage, made a complaint to the Borella police

on 05.04.2020 which is marked as P6A and states; 1038/5, , . .

500903066V .

.

05.04.2012 0500

,

. .

.

The said position was not disputed by the 2nd Party-Respondent-Respondent or the Intervenient

Respondent- Respondent.

In view of the evidence placed before the Magistrate, it is evident that the 1st Party-1st Respondent-

Petitioner (deceased Appellant) was harassed, assaulted, dispossessed from the premises bearing

No. 1038/5 and finally dispossessed from the premises in dispute on or before 05.04.2012.

Page 16 of 17

In terms of Section 68 (3) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, if any person who had been in

possession of the land or part of it, has been forcibly dispossessed within a period of two months

immediately before the date on which the information was filed under Section 66 of the said Act,

its a duty cast on the learned Primary Court Judge, to make a determination to that effect and

make an order directing the party dispossessed to be restored to possession and prohibit all

disturbances of such possession, otherwise than under the authority of an order or decree of a

competent court.

However, in the instant case it is apparent that the learned Magistrate had not properly analyzed

or evaluated the evidence adduced by the 1st Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant and the

Intervenient-Respondent-Respondents, but had come to the conclusion that neither party is entitled

to the possession of the disputed premises and furthermore, had not made any Order regarding the

possession and restoration of possession to the premises in dispute. The learned Primary Court

Judge had solely relied upon the observation notes made by the Investigating officer, had mislead

herself and had come to an erroneous conclusion. The learned Primary Court Judge had not

properly considered the evidence placed before her and had come to the wrong findings of fact

and law and had also held against the 1st Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellants.

Punchi Nona Vs. Padumasena and Others [1994] 2 SLR 117 it was held;

The jurisdiction conferred on a Primary Court under Section 66 is a special jurisdiction.

It is a quasi-criminal jurisdiction. The primary object of the jurisdiction so conferred is the

prevention of a breach of the peace arising in respect of a dispute affecting land. The Court,

in exercising this jurisdiction is not involved in an investigation into title or the right to

possession which is the function of a Civil Court. He is required to take action of a

preventive and provisional nature pending final adjudication of rights in a Civil Court.

In view of the aforesaid reasons, it is apparent that the learned Primary Court Judge and the learned

High Court Judge had failed to appreciate the legal duty cast on the Primary Court Judge in terms

of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

It is worthy to note that a great injustice had been caused to the deceased Appellant by the

erroneous conclusions of the learned Primary Court Judge. Similarly, the learned High Court Judge

Page 17 of 17

also failed to remedy the miscarriage of Justice meted out to the Appellant for the following

reasons;

I. The learned Primary Court Judge has failed to properly evaluate the evidence of this

case when she made her Orders dated 20.03.2012.

II. The learned Primary Court Judge has failed to consider that she has a duty under

Section 68 (1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act to determine as to who was in

possession of the land on the date on which filing of the information under Section 66

took place.

The 1st Party-1st Respondent-Petitioner (deceased Appellant) is entitled to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction of the High Court where exceptional circumstances exist.

Thus, I hold that the learned Primary Court Judge as well as the learned High Court Judge has

erred in Law and facts of the instant case. Thus, we set aside the Order dated 20.03.2013 of the

learned Primary Court Judge and the Order dated 16.12.2013 of the learned High Court Judge and

declare that the 1st Party-1st Respondent-Petitioner (deceased Appellant) is entitled to be restored

to the possession of the disputed premises bearing No. 1038/5, Maradana Road, Borella.

Therefore, we allow the Appeal of the substituted 1st Party-1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant.

Hence, we direct the learned Primary Court Judge, to issue a writ to restore possession of the

substituted 1st Party-1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant on behalf of the deceased Appellant in

order to repair the injustice caused to the deceased Appellant.

No Order is made regarding costs of this appeal.
