Judgment

It appears that the Complainant, being the Officer-in-Charge of Beliaththa Police Station had filed

an information in the Primary Court of Tangalle in case bearing No. 11522, under Section 66 of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act regarding a dispute between the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-

Respondent [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st Respondent] and the 2nd Respondent-

Respondent-Appellant [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant] in respect of an

obstruction of a roadway over the portion of lands marked as M and N in Plan bearing No. 226

dated 12.03.1965.

The learned Primary Court Judge thereafter made an Order to affix notices on the subject matter

and following the notices, the 3rd Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent [hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the 3rd Respondent] had intervened in the said case. Subsequent to both parties filing

respective affidavits, the matter was fixed for inquiry, and parties were allowed to file written

submissions to dispose the inquiry. Thereafter, the learned Primary Court Judge of Tangalle

delivered the Order on 25.07.2013 determining that the 1st and the 3rd Respondents have failed to

prove there was a right to use 10 feet wide roadway and hence dissolved the Interim Order made

on or about 14.03.2013.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the said Respondents had invoked the revisionary jurisdiction

of the High Court of Tangalle to revise the Order dated 25.07.2013 made by the learned Primary

Court Judge of Tangalle.

The 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Appellant had filed objections in respect of the revision

application bearing No. HCRA 18/13 and parties had filed their respective written submissions

and made oral submissions at the inquiry. Following it, the learned High Court Judge of Tangalle

delivered the Order on 17.10.2016 setting aside the Order made by the learned Primary Court

Page 4 of 7

Judge of Tangalle in case bearing No.11522 dated 25.07.2013 and had permitted the 1st and 3rd

Respondents to use 10 feet wide-10 meters long roadway over the subject matter.

Being aggrieved by the said Order dated 17.10.2016, the Appellant had preferred this appeal to

revise and/or to set aside the Order pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial

High Court of Tangalle.

The impugned roadway is described as Lot M in Plan No. 226 dated 12.03.1965, in schedule to

the Petition dated 31.10.2016. According to 1st and 3rd Respondents, the impugned roadway was

used by them as access to Lot L in plan No. 226. However, on or above 16.01.2013 the Appellant

had obstructed the said roadway.

It was submitted by the Appellant that there is no roadway over lot M as access to lot L and that

there is a separate road providing access to the said lot L according to the said plan. It was the

contention of the Appellant that there was no such roadway over the said lot M and that Appellant

is in possession of all the lots namely M, N, O, P, Q, R and T.

The attention of Court was drawn to the document marked as 3V1 and 3V2. 3V1 is the final

Partition Decree in case bearing No. P 717, and it was submitted to substantiate that the 3rd

Respondents mother has obtained ownership to the portions of land; lot M and lot N. However, it

appears that the disputed roadway cuts across lot M according to the said plan 226 marked as 3V2.

Therefore, the Respondents contended that the Appellant is not the lawful owner of lot M and N

in plan 3V2 and admitted the Appellant has ownership only to the portions of land in lots O, P, Q

and R. As such, it is apparent that the Appellant had unlawfully blocked the impugned roadway

over lot M, which the 1st and 3rd Respondents had been using as access to their lot L in plan 3V2.

When considering the affidavits and the counter affidavits of the parties to this case, it is seen that

the 1st Respondents husband is an owner of a three-wheeler and has further stated that they did

not have an alternate roadway to get the three-wheeler into the 1st Respondents premises.

It was stated by the Appellant that the 1st Respondent has an alternative road way to enter their

premises. However, Primary Court may not have considered the availability of an alternative right

of way, if there was any, to deny the right of way used by the Respondents over the disputed

Page 5 of 7

portion of land, when making an Order under Section 69 (2) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

Since the dispute between the parties is relating to a roadway, it appears that Section 69 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act is applicable and according to Section 69 of the Act, there is no

necessity to consider the availability of an alternative roadway.

The learned Primary Court Judge had determined that the 1st and 3rd Respondents had not proved

the fact that the roadway was used for more than 10 years, and thereby as not being entitled to

claim their ownership by way of prescription. The learned Primary Court Judge has further stated

that even the 3rd Petitioner had not established her rights to use the disputed roadway.

By virtue of Section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, there is no need to prove rights as

it is done in a civil suit. The case Ramalingam Vs. Thangarajah [1982] 2SLR 693 held the

following;

On the other hand, if the dispute is in regard to any right to any land other than right of possession

of such land, the question for decision, according to Section 69(1) is, who is entitled to the right

which is subject of dispute. The word entitle here connotes the ownership of the right. The Court

has to determine which of the parties has acquired that right or is entitled for the time being to

exercise that right. In contradiction to Section 68 of the Act, Section 69 requires the court to

determine the question as to which party is entitled to the disputed right of way prior to the making

of an order under Section 69(2).

It was held in the aforementioned case that the entitlement can be proved in the Primary Court by

adducing proof of the entitlement as done in a Civil Court or by offering proof that he is entitled

to the right for the time being

The said contention was analyzed by Justice A.W.A. Salam in the case titled Ananda Sarath

Paranagama Vs. Dhamadinna Sarath Paranagama CA (PHC) 117/2013 [C.A.M. 12.12.2013],

in which Salam J. emphasized of the need to understand that the proof of acquisition of the right

is totally different from proving the enjoyment/existence of the right at the time the dispute arose.

It has been held in the case of Punchi Nona Vs. Padumasena and Others [1994] 2 SLR 117, that

the Primary Court exercising special jurisdiction under Section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act, is not involved in an investigation into the title, right to possession or entitlement,

which are functions of a Civil Court. What the Primary Court is required to do is to take a

Page 6 of 7

preventive action and make a provisional order pending final adjudication of rights of the parties

in a Civil Court.

The attention of Court was drawn to the police observation report. It reveals that the 1st Respondent

and her family members have used the disputed roadway for an extensive period of time.

Furthermore, the said report states that the said roadway in dispute has been shut off by a fence

and was further blocked with the use of coconut leaves. The report further goes on to say that the

neighbours of the 1st Respondent has used the roadway in dispute to reach the 1st Respondents

house. The Appellant has also given a statement to Police objecting to 1st Respondents the use of

the disputed roadway.

The observation report produced by the police contains the following, and shows that the

Respondents to this case has used this roadway.

10 .

.

.

In view of the aforesaid observation notes of the Police Officer, it amply proves that the

Respondent has been using the disputed roadway as a right by way of necessity, to lot L, to the 1st

Respondents house.

According to Section 75, it mandates the Primary Court to deal with a dispute in the nature of

servitude and need not touch upon servitude per se. The Primary Courts (Magistrates Court) are

precluded from dealing with matters described in Schedule 04 of the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978.

The excluded matters inter alia;

Any action for a declaratory decree including a decree for the declaration of title of a land

(item 12) in the 4th Schedule.

For obstruction to or interference with the enjoyment of any servitude or the exercise of

any right over property (item 24 (i).

In civil cases, right of way can be established as a servitudanal right by prescription or by way of

necessity. It was held in Sumangala Vs. Appuhamy 46 NLR 131 that a servitude, such as a right

Page 7 of 7

of foot path must be established by cogent evidence, as it affects the land owners right to a free

and unfettered use of land.

In view of the aforesaid reasons, it is to be noted that the learned Primary Court Judge in his Order

dated 25.07.2013 has held against the Respondents by not giving the right of way to the

Respondents without considering the relevant provisions of law. It is seen that the learned Primary

Court Judge had misdirected himself and had made the impugned order against the Respondent.

As such, the learned Primary Court Judge has erred in law when he decided that the Respondents

are not entitled to use the impugned road in dispute. In view of the aforesaid reasons, it is

imperative to note that the learned Primary Court Judge has erred in law and facts, when he decided

the matter in favour of the 2nd Party-Respondent-Appellants.

Hence, we see no reason to interfere with the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge of

Tangalle setting aside the Order of the learned Magistrate.

Thus, we affirm the Judgment dated 17.10.2016 by the learned High Court Judge and dismiss the

appeal with costs.
