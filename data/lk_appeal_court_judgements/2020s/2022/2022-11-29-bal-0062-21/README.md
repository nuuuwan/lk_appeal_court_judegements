Decided on: 29.11.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to obtain bail to the suspect namely

Ihala Kotambe Gedara Kasun Dhanushka alias Sudu under the

provisions of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and

Witnesses Act no 4 of 2015.

The suspect in the instant matter had been a suspect in a stabbing case

over the dispute of the theft of a motor cycle and the complainant has

made a statement to police that the suspect had threatened him.

The Counsel for the suspect stated that the suspect had been in remand

for the instant matter for nearly two years.

The State Counsel appearing for respondents objected to the

application on the basis that the suspect had threatened the

complainant and that his life is at risk, but failed to state as to when legal

action will be considered against the suspect, she infact stated that the

police have failed to submit the IB extracts so far.

The law pertaining to the instant matter is that when a suspect is

produced under the provisions of the above act bail can be considered

only upon exceptional circumstances by the Court of Appeal. The term

exceptional has not been defined in the statute, but in many of our

decided cases it has been held that exceptionality defers from case to

case. The exceptionality pleaded by the Counsel in the instant matter is

the long period of remand without any action being taken against or for

the suspect by the respondents.

It is observed by this Court that the objective of the instant act is to safe

guard the rights of the victims and the witnesses but at the same time

it has been stated by the act that matters coming under this act must

be given precedence over other matters. But in the instant matter we

do not see any such thing being considered but instead what we see is

that the matter is being dragged on for no good reason.

As such we consider this case to be a fit matter to be considered for the

granting of bail.

As such the instant application for bail is allowed and we direct the

relevant Magistrate to enlarge the above named suspect on suitable

conditions of bail without delay upon the receipt of this order.

We direct the Registrar of this Court to convey the instant order to the

relevant Magistrates Court.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
