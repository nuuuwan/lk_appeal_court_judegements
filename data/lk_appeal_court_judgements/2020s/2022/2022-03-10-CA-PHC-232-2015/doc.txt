JUDGMENT

The Petitioner-Appellant had invoked the jurisdiction aggrieved by the judgment dated 29.12.2015

delivered by the High Court of the North Western Province (Holden in Kurunagala). The Petitioner

pleads that he was a school principal attached to the Sri Lanka Principal Service. He had started

his carrier as a Teacher attached to Sri Lanka Teacher Service in 1989. In the year 2009, after

completing the relevant examinations, he was appointed to Class II Grade II of the Sri Lanka

Principal Service 2009.

However, before the appointment in 2008, he was served a charge sheet dated 25.09.2008. After

an inquiry, he was found guilty for three charges out of eight. As a punishment, two salary

increments were stopped. Against the order of the inquiry, he had appealed to the 1st Respondent

on 30.12.2011. By a decision dated 08.08.2012, the 1st Respondent dismissed the said appeal. Then

Petitioner moved the jurisdiction of the High Court of the North Central Province on the grounds

Mentioned below:

(a) The Petitioner was denied the protection of natural justice, particularly the principle of

Audi alteram partem, as he was not allowed to call witnesses.

(b) The Petitioner was denied the protection of natural justice, particularly the principle of

Audi alteram partem, as he was not allowed to produce several documents in evidence.

(c) There was no evidence supporting the guilty finding regarding charges VI, VII and VIII.

(d) The Petitioner's wife's evidence was led against the Petitioner is against the law and public

policy.

(e) The disciplinary inquiry and the order are tainted with malice.

On the 29th of December 2015, the High Court order was pronounced dismissing the Petition. In

this court, the Petitioner-Appellant argues on

(a) Failure to appreciate the denial of fair hearing

(b) Calling the wife of the Appellant is against public policy.

(c) There was no evidence regarding the three charges he was found guilty of.

At the hearing, both parties placed their respective arguments before this court. The Appellant

stresses that the two witnesses he requested were not called. At the inquiry, the inquiring Officer

had observed that the two witnesses named were the superior officers of the Appellant. They were

in charge of taking disciplinary actions, transfers, promotions, retirement and interdicting of the

Appellant.

The two witnesses called by the inquiring Officer were W.M. Indrawathi Manike and M.

Karunawathi. M. Karunawathi was a co-teacher attached to a primary school at the time of giving

evidence. The other witness W.M. Indrawathi Manike was an acting principal when giving

evidence. Bulathsinghalage Ranjith Upali Assistant Director of Education (Primary) attached to

Puttalam Educational Office. M.M.E. Suriya Peris is another teacher, R.D. Sloman - Zonal

Director of Education Dhammika Priyadarshini was also a teacher, Grasion was an Administrative

Officer. One can observe that other than R.D. Sollaman and B.R. Upali was not able to speak of

the personal records of the Appellant. These two witnesses are indeed the officers from the

Education Department, but the refusal to call the Appellant's witnesses are baseless. The inquiring

Officer recorded that the senior officers' witnesses named by the Appellant need not be called.

In order to call them, the permission of the Public Service Commission (North Western) must be

obtained. There is no denial of calling the witnesses, as the Respondents argued. The Respondents

(1-7 and 9) argued that the Appellant had enough opportunity to question the subordinate officers

called by the prosecution at the inquiry.

The position of the inquiring Officer was not that he disallowed calling but instructed to get

permission from the Secretary of the Public Service Commission, North-Western Province.

The Appellant at the inquiry had requested to call J.P.H. Thilakarathna, [North-Western Province]

Assistant Director and P. Padma Wahasala Zonal Director of Education Puttalam as his

witnesses. By written communication, the Secretary of the Public Service Commission (North-

Western Province) had informed that special permission is not necessary to call witnesses;

therefore, the inquiring Officer should decide.

The learned High Court Judge had observed that there was no need to call the Senior Officers

when their juniors were present. The Appellant had the opportunity to cross-examine and establish

his defence.

In this country, the measure to find someone guilty in a criminal case is beyond reasonable ground

until the prosecution proves that the accused is treated as an innocent party. Even though the

domestic inquiries are different and the inquiring officers are not learned in the law, they must

have a similar approach when deciding the fate of a fellow citizen. He must be allowed to

understand he had a fair hearing. He must be satisfied that his side of the story, too, was heard.

It is up to the Appellant to give evidence or not. His silence without giving evidence himself is not

a bar for him to call witnesses. The law requires that if he opts to give evidence, he must give

evidence first.

For this inquiry to be fair, the Appellant should have had the opportunity to call his witness and

establish his defence. According to the letter of the Secretary, there is no barrier to calling the

witnesses; even though they are official witnesses, the decision of calling or not was in the hand

of the inquiring officer. This denial is fatal.

As for recording the evidence of his wife should not have been allowed. The Evidence Ordinance

has stipulated when a spouse can be called a witness. Though the inquiring Officer is not

knowledgeable about the Evidence Ordinance, it is common knowledge that a spouse's evidence

is usually tainted. Even though the Respondents (1-7 and the 9th ] argue that this is a domestic

inquiry, the Evidence Ordinance does not apply. One must keep in mind that there is a punishment

at the end of the domestic inquiry. That is why even a domestic inquiry should not only be fair,

but it should seem to be fair.

The wife's evidence was indeed limited. Appellant or his representative did not object to her

evidence was also stressed on behalf of the contesting Respondents. They argue that the Appellant

is now estopped from taking advantage of his wife giving evidence.

Even though a layman was in charge of the proceedings, inquiring Officer should have inquired

whether there was an objection to calling the wife.

However, this point was not discussed by the High Court judge. A judicial officer must consider

every aspect, especially when they are pleaded. Even if a particular point is not argued, the judge

must consider, evaluate, and answer if that point is essential. Calling the wife, especially when a

divorce case is pending, should have been considered by the High Court Judge. To the naked eye

calling a spouse as a witness against the other spouse in any inquiry is beyond reason. Even in a

court of law, a spouse is called only in instances provided for in Evidence Ordinance.

The final ground of not having evidence on the three counts found guilty is vague. Even if I hold

with the Respondents on that ground, the Respondents will fail on not having a fair hearing.

For the reasons discussed above, I allow the appeal.

PRESANTHA DE SILVA, J.

I agree.
