JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) were indicted in the High Court of Chilaw under Section 296 of

the Penal Code for committing the murder of Narayana Mudiyanselage

Ananda Kulatilaka on or about 11th August 2003.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Chilaw as the

Appellants had opted for a non-jury trial. After the conclusion of the

prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge had called for the defence

and the 1st Appellant had given evidence from the witness box while the 2nd

Appellant had made a dock statement. After considering the evidence

presented by both parties, the learned High Court Judge had convicted the

Appellants as charged and sentenced both to death on 12/03/2015.

3 | P a g e

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants have given consent to argue this matter in their absence due to

the Covid 19 pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellants were

connected via Zoom platform from prison.

Background of the Case.

According to PW1, the wife of the deceased, at about 3.45 p.m. on the date

of the incident, while her deceased husband and herself were in the garden

in front of their house playing with their youngest daughter, the Appellants

who are well known to them had come there with the 1st Appellant

possessing a sword and 2nd Appellant possessing an iron bar. On seeing

them the deceased ran towards a house adjacent to the land but the

Appellants had chased him. The deceased thereafter, left that house and

when he tried to creep through a fence, the 1st Appellant had cut the

deceased who had then landed on his hands. When he fell down the 1st

Appellant had cut the deceaseds leg. Thereafter, the 2nd Appellant had

dealt a blow on his head. After assaulting the deceased severely, both

Appellants had left the place quickly.

The deceased was rushed to the hospital but was pronounced dead upon

admission. The deceased was speechless after the attack by the Appellants.

The Appellants were arrested on the following day by the police and a

sword and an iron bar were recovered upon the statement of the 1st and 2nd

Appellants respectively.

The deceased had suffered 5 external injuries in the nature of a laceration

on the head, 3 cut injuries on the right leg and groin and left wrist and a

contusion on the head.

4 | P a g e

Having satisfied that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case

against the Appellants, the Learned Trial Judge had called for the defence.

The 1st Appellant had given evidence under oaths while the 2nd Appellant

had made a statement from the dock and closed their respective cases.

The learned High Court Judge had sentenced the Appellants to death on

12/03/2015.

The Appellants had separately canvassed their Appeal grounds through

their counsels.

The First Appellant had filed the following grounds of appeal.

1. The learned trial Judge has erred with regard to the principles

relating to Section 27(1) recovery.

2. The Learned trial Judge has erred by relying upon inadmissible

evidence thereby causing grave prejudice to the Appellant thereby

denied a fair trial.

3. The learned trial Judge has drawn adverse inferences against the

1st Appellant his failure to give evidence in relation to the statutory

statement.

4. The Judgment pronounced in this case is devoid of proper judicial

analysis and evaluation of evidence and total disregard of Section

283 of Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

The Second Appellant had filed the following grounds of appeal.

1. The prosecution has not proved the case beyond reasonable

grounds.

2. The Learned trial Judge has rejected the defence evidence on

unreasonable grounds.

5 | P a g e

3. The Learned trial Judge has permitted the confessionary

statement of the 1st Appellant to be used to impeach his

credibility.

4. Evidence under Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance has been

led contrary to law.

Considering the grounds of appeal raised by the Appellants, it is apparent

that few grounds are inter related to each other. Hence, I decided to

consider this appeal under the following common appeal grounds:

1. The prosecution has not proved the case beyond reasonable

doubts.

2. Evidence under Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance has

been led contrary to law.

3. The learned trial Judge has permitted the confessionary

statement of 1st Appellant to impeach his credibility causing

grave prejudice to the Appellants thereby denying them a fair

trial.

4. The Learned trial Judge has rejected the defence evidence on

unreasonable grounds.

5. The Judgment pronounced in this case is devoid of proper

judicial analysis and evaluation of evidence and total disregard of

Section 283 of Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

6. The Learned trial Judge has drawn adverse inferences against

the 1st Appellants failure to give evidence in relation to the

statutory statement.

Considering the first ground of appeal it is admitted by the Appellants that

they had gone to the deceaseds house on the date of incident to inquire in

to a rumor that had been spread against the 1st Appellant allegedly by the

6 | P a g e

deceased. Hence, presence of the Appellants at the crime scene is not

disputed in this case.

Although motive is not necessary to prove in a criminal trial, existence of a

motive would strengthen the prosecution case. In this case the evidence

revealed that the deceased had taken his friends son to the police station

to make a complaint against the 1st Appellant for sexually abusing the boy.

According to PW1, while they were playing and enjoying with their little

daughter in front of her house, the 1st Appellant and the 2nd Appellant had

come there armed with a sword and iron rod respectively, chased the

deceased and cut and assaulted him to death. She had vividly explained

how the deceased tried to avoid the Appellants after seeing them. PW2, the

deceaseds daughter also narrated the same as her mother PW1.

The defence had marked two contradictions on the evidence of PW1 and

one contradiction on the evidence of PW2. As those contradictions are not

forceful enough to create a doubt on the prosecution case, the rejection of

those contradictions has not caused any prejudice to the Appellants.

Further, none of the witnesses are expected give 100% accurate evidence in

a trial.

In State of Uttar Pradesh v. M. K. Anthony [AIR 1985 SC 48] the court

held that:

While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach

must be whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole

appears to have a ring of truth. Once that impression is formed,

it is undoubtedly necessary for the court to scrutinise the

evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies,

draw-backs and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a

whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the

7 | P a g e

general tenor of the evidence given by the witness and whether

the earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken as to render it

unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not

touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach by

taking sentences torn out of context here or there from the

evidence, attaching importance to some technical error

committed by the investigating officer not going to the : root of

the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence

as a whole. Even honest and truthful witnesses may differ in

some details unrelated to the main incident because power of

observation, retention and reproduction differ with individuals.

Cross examination is an unequal duel between a rustic and

refined lawyer.

Further the evidence given by PW1 and PW2 had been corroborated by an

independent witness PW4, a neighbor of the deceased. He had seen the

Appellants running behind the deceased. He had further confirmed that the

1st Appellant had possessed a sword while the 2nd Appellant had a black

colored rod. He had not witnessed the attack, but had seen the deceased

lying on the ground motionless with severe cut injury on his hand and legs.

The evidence given by the lay witnesses had very well corroborated with the

medical evidence pertaining to the injury inflicted on the deceased.

The learned High Court Judge had considered and analyzed the evidence

accurately even though he did not have the advantage of seeing the

demeanour and deportment of the witnesses.

As the prosecution had presented overwhelming evidence against the

Appellants, it is not correct to say that they had not proved the case

against the Appellants beyond reasonable grounds. Hence, I reject this

ground of appeal as it has no merit.

8 | P a g e

In the second ground of Appeal the Counsels contended that the evidence

under Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance has been led contrary to

law.

Ordinarily, a statement made by an accused person is inadmissible against

him. As exception to this rule is the admissibility of statements under

Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance where a portion of a statement

made to a police officer and which leads to the discovery of a fact can be led

in evidence.

The Appellants contend that the prosecution led evidence about purported

statements made by the Appellants in consequence of which the weapons

were discovered. The Police officer who recorded the statements was dead

at the time the evidence was sought to be led. In such circumstances the

learned Trial Judge should not have permitted the leading of that

confessionary part of the statements under Section 27(1) of the Evidence

Ordinance. The prejudice caused by such statements far outweigh the

evidentiary value of such statements. In the circumstances the Appellant

further contended that the learned Trial Judge should not have permitted

this evidence to be led.

In this case, after receiving information a team of police officers led by

PW7(dead) had conducted investigations, arrested the Appellants and

recovered the production based upon their statements under Section 27(1)

of the Evidence Ordinance. During the trial PW9, who was a member of the

police team had given evidence covering the investigation done by PW7. The

learned State Counsel before leading the substantial evidence satisfied the

court that he was a member of the investigation team, worked under PW7

and was very well acquainted with PW7s handwriting and signature.

Thereafter, he had given substantial evidence pertaining to the

investigations and recoveries done in this case. Also marked the relevant

9 | P a g e

portions from the statements of the Appellants pertaining to Section 27(1)

recoveries, identified the productions and the Appellants.

The Defence had not objected when the prosecution led evidence of PW9

based on the investigation notes put by PW7. The learned State Counsel

obtained a clarification from PW9 that he acted under Section 159(2) of the

Evidence Ordinance and satisfied himself of the accuracy of the

investigation done by PW7 who was dead at the time of the trial.

PW7 had given evidence with regard to the very commencement of the

investigation until the arrest and recovery of productions. Correct identity

of the Appellants also established without any contradiction. Even if PW7 is

alive, he would have given the same evidence as PW9 in this case because

of his active participation in the investigation.

In a similar situation in the case of CA/296/2009 decided on 07/08/2015

the court held:

Accused-Appellant whilst challenging the conviction and

Sentence both, took up the position, that this is a single witness

case where the prosecution has relied entirely on Police

Constable Ranil, whose evidence could be only treated as

hearsay evidence, in the absence of the Chief Investigating

Officer, IP Tennakoon..

Even though Police Constable Ranil has not made the arrest, this

court is of the view that the above evidence of police Constable

Ranil will have the same effect as if IP Tennakoon had given

evidence in this case. Police Constable Ranil speaks from the

time he received the information up to sealing of Productions at

the Police Narcotic Bureau where he actively took part in the

investigation as the raid had been carried out on information

provided through his informant.

10 | P a g e

Given the reasons above, I conclude that leading investigation evidence and

marking recovery done under Section 27(1) of Evidence Ordinance through

PW9 is not improper and has not occasioned any prejudice to the

Appellants in this case. Hence, I find no merit in this appeal ground as

well.

In the third ground of appeal the Appellants contest that the learned trial

Judge has permitted the confessionary statement of the 1st Appellant to

impeach his credibility causing grave prejudice to the Appellants thereby

denying them a fair trial.

Section 110(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979

provides in general that a statement made to a police officer in the course

of an investigation may be used in accordance with the provisions of the

Evidence Ordinance except for the purpose of corroboration.

It further provides that a statement of an accused person in the course of

an investigation shall only be used to prove that he made a different

statement at a different time. By way of further proviso, it states that the

limitation placed in respect of the statement made by an accused in the

course of an investigation would not apply in respect of section 27 of the

Evidence Ordinance. Hence, in the case of an accuseds statement, it could

be used for the purpose of marking contradictions.

Section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance states:

1. No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a

person accused of any offence.

2. No confession made to a forest officer with respect of an act made

punishable under the Forest Ordinance, or to an excise officer with

11 | P a g e

respect of an act made punishable under the Excise Ordinance,

shall be proved as against any person making such confession.

In The Queen v. Abadda 66 NLR 397 the court held that:

The question whether a statement made by an accused person

to a police officer is a confession within the meaning of section

25 of the Evidence Ordinance is one that has to be decided upon

reading the entire statement. If the statement as a whole

contains a statement that the accused person committed an

offence or that suggests the inference that he committed an

offence, then it would come within the prohibition contained in

section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Where the accused's statement contains a confession, the

prohibition contained in section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance

bars the proof against the accused of not only those portions of

the statement which admit guilt or suggest the inference that he

committed the offence but also those portions of the statement

which when taken out of the context by themselves are

innocuous. No portion of a confession can be proved against an

accused person.

In this case the 1st Appellant had given evidence under oaths and had been

subjected to cross-examination by the State Counsel. Under cross-

examination the State Counsel had marked 07 contradictions, X1-X8

against the statements given to the police after his arrest. The said

contradictions are reproduced below:

13 | P a g e

(Page No. 354)

Out of the seven contradictions the learned Trial Judge had only

considered X2 in his judgement at page 24. The learned High Court Judge

had taken into consideration that the 1st Appellant had said to the police

that he had gone to the deceaseds house carrying a sword. The learned

High Court judge despite the stiff resistance from the defence Counsel

allowed that contradiction to be marked as X2. In his Judgement at page

24, he further held that the contradiction X2 affects the root of the defence

case.

In King v. Kiriwasthu 40 NLR 289 the court held:

A confession made to a Police Officer is inadmissible as proof

against the person making it whether as substantive evidence or

in order to show that he has contradicted himself.

In King v. Fernando 41 NLR 151 the court held that:

That the Crown was not entitled to cross-examine the accused

on the statement as it was obnoxious to section 25 of the

Evidence Ordinance.

Further, that the statement could not be regarded as an

exculpatory statement, as it was capable of being construed as

establishing a prima facie case against the accused.

In Regina v. Batcho 57 NLR 100 the court held that:

It is contrary to the provisions of section 25 of the Evidence

Ordinance to cross-examine an accused person on what are, in

14 | P a g e

effect, the contents of a confessional statement made by him to

the Police.

Considering above mentioned judicial decisions, in this case the learned

Trial Judge should not have allowed the prosecution to mark

contradictions on his statement which contain the confessionary portions,

given to the police upon his arrest. This is a clear misdirection by the

learned Trial Judge. This could have been averted had the Trial Judge

considered the timely objection raised by the Defence Counsel during the

trial.

Even though the prosecution had marked 08 contradictions on the

statement of the Appellant, as said earlier, the Learned High Court Judge

had only considered contradiction X2 in his judgment.

The prosecution had led firm evidence that the 1st Appellant had come

there armed with a sword. This evidence is not contradicted in the trial.

Even though X2 is improperly admitted, it is not capable of creating a

doubt on the overwhelming evidence presented by the prosecution. Hence

acceptance of prosecution evidence has not occasioned a failure of justice

in this case.

In R v. Voisin [1918] 1 K.B. 531 it was held that there is a discretion to

exclude evidence obtained in breach of the rules.

Further the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and the

Constitution of our country provide provisions to rectify any error, omission

or irregularity in a judgment where such error, omission or irregularity

which has not prejudiced the substantial right of the parties or occasioned

a failure of justice.

15 | P a g e

Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No: 15 of 1979 states as

follows:

Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgment

passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed

or altered on appeal or revision on account-

(a) of any error, omission or irregularity in the complaint,

summons, warrants, charge, judgment, summing up or other

proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other

proceedings under this code; or

(b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135,

Unless such error, omission, irregularity, or want has

occasioned a failure of justice. [ Emphasis added]

Article 138 of The Constitution of Democratic Republic of Sri Lanka

states:

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to

the provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an

appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in

fact or in law which shall be 111 [committed by the High

Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original

jurisdiction or by any Court of First Instance], tribunal

or other institution and sole and exclusive cognizance,

by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, of

all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and

things 112 [of which such High Court, Court of First

Instance] tribunal or other institution may have taken

cognizance:

16 | P a g e

Provided that no judgment, decree, or order of any

court shall be revised or varied on account of any

error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced

the substantial right of the parties or occasioned a

failure of justice. [ Emphasis added]

Considering X2 in the judgment I find no prejudice occasioned nor the

occurrence of a failure of justice in this case. Hence this ground of appeal

is also devoid of any merit.

In the fourth ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the learned

Trial Judge has rejected the defence evidence on unreasonable grounds.

The single most important criterion in evaluating the fairness of a trial is

the observance of the principle of equality of arms between the defence and

the prosecution. Equality of arms, which must be observed throughout the

trial, means that both parties are treated in a manner ensuring their

procedurally equal position during the course of the trial.

In this case the learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence

presented by both parties to arrive at his decision. He has properly

analyzed the evidence given by both sides in his judgment. As the evidence

adduced by the Appellants failed to create a doubt over the prosecution

case, the conclusion reached by the learned High Court Judge in this case

cannot be faulted. Therefore, I reject the fourth ground of appeal urged by

the Appellants as well.

In the fifth ground of appeal, the Appellants contend that the judgment

pronounced in this case is devoid of proper judicial analysis and evaluation

of evidence and have affected total disregard of Section 283 of Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

17 | P a g e

In this case the learned High Court Judge even though he had not had the

benefit to observe the demeanor and deportment of the witness who gave

evidence during the trial, had properly evaluated the evidence given by both

sides to arrive at a correct finding. Considering the entirety of the

judgment, it is incorrect to say that the learned High Court Judge had

totally disregarded Section 283 of Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of

1979. Hence, this ground has no merit for consideration.

In the final ground of appeal, the 1st Appellant contends that the learned

trial Judge has drawn adverse inferences against the 1st Appellant based on

his failure give evidence in relation to the statutory statement.

The learned High Court in his judgment at the second paragraph of page

27 mentioned about the contents of the statutory statements of both the

Appellants which had been marked as P6. When Learned Magistrate acted

under Sections 150, 151 and 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No.15 of 1979, the Appellants had expressed their willingness not to give

evidence nor to call witnesses and had reserved their rights to adduce

evidence at the High Court.

Even though the learned High Court Judge had mentioned about the

statutory statements of the Appellant in his judgment, it has not caused

any prejudice to the rights of the Appellants. Hence, I find this final ground

also devoid of any merits.

In Alwis v. Piyasena Fernando [1993] 1 Sri. L. R 119 the court held that:

It is well established that findings of primary facts by a trial

Judge who hears and sees witnesses are not to be lightly

disturbed on appeal. The findings in this case are based

largely on credibility of witnesses.

18 | P a g e

As discussed under the appeal grounds advanced by the Appellants, the

prosecution had adduced strong and incriminating evidence against the

Appellants. The Learned High Court Judge had very correctly analyzed all

the evidence presented by all the parties and come to a correct finding that

the Appellants were guilty of committing the murder of the deceased in this

case.

Therefore, I affirm the conviction and dismiss the Appeal of the Appellants.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgement to the High Court

of Chillaw along with the original case record.
