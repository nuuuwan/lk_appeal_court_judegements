Judgment

This is an appeal preferred against the Order made by the learned High Court Judge

of Monaragala on 06.12.2017 dismissing the revision application filed against the

Order of the learned Magistrate of Monaragala dated 20.11.2017 in case bearing No.

82466. It appears that Estate Superintendent of Janatha Estate Development Board

being the competent authority had filed an application bearing No. 82466 in terms

of Section 6 of the Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1969,

to recover possession of the premises described in the schedule of the application.

The Respondent namely U.K.G. Wimalaratne had been in possession of the said

premises and upon serving the notice of the said application, the Respondent had

shown cause why he should not be quit from the subject premises by the competent

Page 3 of 7

authority. Subsequently, the learned Magistrate pronounced the Order in favour of

the competent authority, allowing the application to evict the Respondent from the

subject premises.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondent-Petitioner had invoked the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Monaragala, in case bearing

No. 56/2017. After the application was supported, the learned High Court Judge

dismissed the application of the Respondent-Petitioner in limine on the ground that

Respondent-Petitioner had not shown the learned Magistrates Order as ex-facie

wrong in law.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned High Court Judge dated 06.12.2017,

the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Appellant) had preferred this appeal to the Court of Appeal. The Appellant pointed

out that the competent authority had made the application by way of a notice to

the Magistrates Court under Section 3 of the Government Quarters (Recovery of

Possession) Act No. 7 of 1969. However, the learned Magistrate had pronounced the

Order taking into consideration the provisions of State Land (Recovery of

Possession) Act and not under the Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession)

Act. Thus, the Appellant contended that the impugned Order of the learned

Magistrate is fundamentally wrong in law.

Court draws the attention to the Order of the learned Magistrate where the learned

Magistrate states that;

... () () . () () () .

It appears that the said form () filed by the Respondent-Competent Authority is

under the Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1969 and not

under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979. However, the

Page 4 of 7

learned Magistrate had referred to the said form () under the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 instead of Government Quarters (Recovery

of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1969.

In this instance, Court draws the attention to Section 7 of the Government Quarters

(Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1969 which stipulates that;

(1) Upon receipt of an application for ejectment in respect of any

Government quarters, a Magistrates Court shall forthwith issue, and if need

be reissue, a writ of possession to the Fiscal requiring and authorizing such

Fiscal before a date specified in the writ, not being a date earlier than three

or later than seven clear days from the date of the issue of such writ, to

deliver possession of such quarters to the competent authority or other

authorized person specified in the quit notice relating to such premises. Such

writ shall be sufficient authority for the said Fiscal or any police officer

authorized by him in that behalf to enter such quarters with such assistants

as the Fiscal or such officer shall deem necessary and to give possession

accordingly, and to eject the occupier and his dependents, if any, from such

quarters.

(2) Notwithstanding anything in any other law, the issue or re-issue

of a writ of possession under subsection (1) shall not be stayed in any manner,

by reason of any steps taken or proposed to be taken in any court with a view

to questioning the issue or re-issue of such writ of possession or the quit notice

in pursuance of which such writ of possession is issued or re-issued.

(3) Nothing in this Act shall be read and construed as precluding any

person who claims to have been unlawfully ejected from Government

quarters under this section from instituting an action for damages or other

relief.

According to the said Section, it is seen that in an ejectment in respect of any

government quarters, Magistrate has to issue a writ of possession forthwith on a date

specified in the writ, not being a date earlier than 3 days or later than 7 days from

the date of issuing such writ. It is to be observed that State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979, Sections 10 and 11, deal with delivering possession of

subject land to the Competent Authority forthwith.

Page 5 of 7

In this respect, Court draws the attention to the Preamble of Government Quarters

(Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1969 as well as the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979. The Preamble of Government Quarters (Recovery of

Possession) Act No. 7 of 1969 states, An Act to make provisions for the recovery of

possession of quarters provided by or on behalf of the government or a public

corporation for the occupation of persons, and for matters connected therewith or

incidental thereto. The Preamble of State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.

7 of 1979 states, An Act to make provisions for the recovery of possession of state

lands from persons in unauthorized possession or occupation thereof and for matters

connected therewith or incidental thereto.

It is worthy to note that both Acts, State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7

of 1979 and Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1969 have

made provisions for the recovery of possession of the subject premises. It is

observable that there is not much difference between the two Acts, State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act and Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act.

Therefore, it is worthy to note that no material prejudice has been caused to the

Appellant under the Order made to evict the Respondent from the subject matter

by the learned Magistrate referring to the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act

instead of Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act in his Order.

Therefore, Court holds that the learned Magistrate has proceeded with the

application of the Competent Authority under Government Quarters (Recovery of

Possession) Act although the learned Magistrate had inadvertently referred to State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act in his order dated 20.11.2017.

It is apparent that no material prejudice is caused to the Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant in this matter due to the inadvertence of the learned Magistrate indicating

the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act instead of Government Quarters

(Recovery of Possession) Act in his Order. Thus, I hold that it is not a ground to set

aside the impugned Order of the Magistrate.

This aspect of Law is emphasized by De Silva J. in W.M. Mendis & Co. Vs. Excise

Commissioner [1999] 1 SLR 351 in 356 that Falsa demonstratio non nocet cum de

corpore vel persona constat (a false description does not harm if there be sufficient

Page 6 of 7

certainty as to the subject-matter or the person) and Falsa demonstratio non nocet

cum decorpore vel persona constat (any inaccuracy in description is to be over

looked if the subject-matter or person is well-known). As such, Court ex mere motu

acts and corrects the Act referred in paragraph 1 of the Order dated 20.11.2017 as

...1979 07 ( ( ... and in

the last paragraph of the Order . ( )

09 . which had occurred due to inadvertence. In the case

at hand, Im of the view that the error in question is a harmless one which has

occurred due to inadvertence and not egregious or damaging to the party concerned.

Thus, it is apparent that the objection raised on behalf of the Appellant is highly

technical in nature. On this premise, the Court draws the attention to the Judgment

by Justice Samayawardhena in Methodist Trust Association of Ceylon Vs.

Divisional Director of Education of Galle and Others [CA/WRIT/192/2015] CA

Minutes 08.01.2019 in which his Lordship observes that,

Although disposing of cases on technical grounds is easy and speedy. But

that is not what the aggrieved party expects from Court. The aggrieved

party wants case to be disposed of on merits rather than on technical

grounds. It is generally the wrongdoer who cannot meet the case on

merits, tries to cling on technical objections to defeat justice. We must

understand that we are working in Courts of Law and not in Academies of

Law and therefore, in my view, we must, as much as possible, try to

dispose of cases on merits rather than on highly technical grounds.

It is settled law that in an action to recover Possession of a State Land, the only

available defense for the possessor sought to be evicted from the subject land, is to

establish that he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or

other written authority of the State granted according to any written law.

The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant has not submitted any document, valid permit

or grant to substantiate the fact that he had written permission or authority to

occupy the state land in question.

Page 7 of 7

It was held in Gunaratne (Alexis Auction Rooms) Vs. Abeysinghe (Urban

Development Authority) [1988] 1 SLR 255 that it is the burden of the occupier to

establish that he is in occupation of the land on a valid permit or other written

authority of the state. Since the Appellant has failed to establish that he is in

occupation or possession of the land in question in accordance with Section 9 (1) of

the said Act, there is no alternative for the learned Magistrate, other than to allow

the application of the Competent Authority. As such, it is apparent that the Order

dated 20.11.2017 of the learned Magistrate is well-founded.

In view of the said observations, we are inclined to apply the legal maxim Nunc Pro

Tunc [now for then] and correct the name of the Act as Government Quarters

(Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1969 instead of State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979.

Hence, the objection raised on behalf of the Appellant to revise or set aside the

impugned Order of the learned Magistrate is rejected by this Court and the appeal

is dismissed with costs.
