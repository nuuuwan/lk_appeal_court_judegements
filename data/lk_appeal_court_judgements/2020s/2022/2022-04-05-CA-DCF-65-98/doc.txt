S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Plaintiff- Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) instituted a partition

action by the plaint dated 30.10.1987 in the District Court of Kalutara for partitioning

the land known as Kongahawatta alias Gulngahawatta in the extent of 0A 3R 37.2P

situated in Mahawaskaduwa in Kautara. After the statements of claim were filed, the

case proceeded to trial between the plaintiff and the 1st, 2nd, 7th, 12th and 13th Defendant

Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the 1st, 2nd, 7th ,12th and 13th Defendants) on 29

points of contest. After the conclusion of the trial, by judgement dated 02.12.1997 the

learned Additional District Judge decided that the land sought to be partitioned in the

action is shown as lots 1 and 2 in the preliminary plan No. 4040 dated 06.02.1985

(marked X) prepared by N. Seneviratne Licenced Surveyor and lots 3 to 7 in plan X

does not form the corpus of the subject matter. Even though, the learned Additional

District Judge has identified the land sought to be partitioned as lots 1 and 2, the action

has been dismissed on the basis that the Plaintiff has failed to prove his title to the land.

It has been concluded that the 7th Defendant has proved his title to lots 1 and 2 and

therefore, he is entitled to the entire land identified as the subject matter of the action.

The 1st and 7th Defendants preferred his appeal seeking to exclude certain portions of

the judgment that the Court has made observations and /or findings about the lots 3 to

7 and a building stand on lot 3 in plan X. As mentioned hereinbefore, the learned

Additional District Judge has decided that those lots does not from the corpus. In the

7

judgment, he has observed inter alia, that lots 6 and 7 has become parts of the main

road, the land situated to the east of the main road is a separate land, lot 4 has been

bought by the 13th Defendant to get excess to his land, he has used that lot without any

obstruction of the other parties as a right of way, lot 3 has been devolved on the 15th

Defendant on deeds as a separate land and therefore, he should be entitled to that lot

and the building marked A standing thereon (at pages 277 and 278 of the Appeal

brief).

In terms of section 25 of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977, at the trial, the court is

required to examine the title of each party and try and determine all questions of law

and fact arising in the action in regard to the right, share or interest of each party to, of,

or in the land to which the action relates and should consider and decide which of the

orders mentioned in section 26 should be made.

Section 26(1) and (2) of the Partition Act, No. 21 of 1977 provides thus;

26 (1) At the conclusion of the trial of a partition action, or on such later date as the

court may fix, the court shall pronounce judgment in open court, and the judgment shall

be dated and signed by the Judge at the time of pronouncing it. As soon as may be after

the judgment is pronounced, the court shall enter an interlocutory decree in accordance

with the findings in the judgment, and such decree shall be signed by the Judge.

26 (2) The interlocutory decree may include one or more of the following orders, so

however that the orders are not inconsistent with one another: -

(a) order for a partition of the land;

(b) order for a sale of the land in whole or in lots;

(c) order for a sale of a share or portion of the land and a partition of the remainder;

(d) order that any portion of the land representing the share of any particular party only

shall be demarcated and separated from the remainder of the land;

(e) order that any specified portion of the land shall continue to belong in common to

specified parties or to a group of parties;

8

(f) order that any specified portion of the land sought to be partitioned or surveyed be

excluded from the scope of the action;

(g) order that any share remain unallotted.

Therefore, in a partition action, the District Judge could make any order/orders

mentioned in section 26 (2) of the Partition Act. In the case of Hewavitharana Vs.

Themis De Silva1 it was decided that there is no provision in the Act, providing for a

declaration of title to a land solely owned by a person which has been wrongly included

in the corpus sought to be partitioned. If the trial Judge decides to exclude any portion

of the land shown in the preliminary plan from the corpus he may do so, but he is not

entitled to investigate the title to that portion or make any determination about the

improvements standing thereon. Under such circumstances, I hold that the conclusions

of the learned Additional District Judge regarding the entitlement of parties to lots 3 to

7 in plan X and the improvements standing thereon are against the partition law and

those findings could cause prejudice to the rights of the parties who are the owners of

those lots. Therefore, I hold that the observations and/or conclusions of the trial judge

in respect of lots 3 to 7 should be excluded from the judgment. The dismissal of the

action is affirmed. No costs ordered.
