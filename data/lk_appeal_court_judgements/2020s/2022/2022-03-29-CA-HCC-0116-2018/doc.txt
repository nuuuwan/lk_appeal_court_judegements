JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo under Sections 54(A) (b) and 54(A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for

Trafficking and Possession of 8.93 grams of Heroin on 06th September 2011.

After trial, the Appellant was found guilty on the 2nd count and the Learned

High Court Judge of Colombo has imposed life imprisonment on the said

count on 05/04/2018. He was acquitted from the 1st count.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. During the argument he was connected via Zoom from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. The Learned Trial Judge failed to consider the defence taken up by the

Accused Appellant which is that heroin was in the possession of

Mohamed Murshid Anwer and that he was released after his wife and

others saw him at the PNB for alleged investigations.

3 | P a g e

2. The Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself on the law by

allowing PW9 to base his testimony before Court on the notes made by

PW4 without satisfying himself that the provisions of Section 159 of

the Evidence Ordinance have been complied with.

3. The Learned Trial Judge who delivered the judgement misdirected

himself on the law by adopting the evidence led before his predecessor

under Section 48 of the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978, when the main

witnesses for the prosecution had already testified and therefore

knowing very well that he will be bereft of the opportunity of applying

the legally recognised yardsticks of the law such as demeanour and

deportment to assess the evidence of the main witnesses who testified

on behalf of the prosecution.

4. The Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself on the law by using the

testimony of PW9 to corroborate the testimony of PW1.

Background of the case.

On 06/09/2011 SI Manoj Gayantha attached to the Police Narcotic Bureau

had received information from his private informant about the trafficking of

Heroin by a person called Sandar Thadeeswaran. The informant had further

revealed that the Appellant would show up near the Ruby Cinema Hall,

Maradana in a three-wheeler with registration number QB 3133. Acting on

that information PW1 had arranged a team comprising 07 officers attached

to Police Narcotic Bureau and left the bureau at 16:50 hours. Before their

departure the Officer-in-Charge of the Police Narcotic Bureau had been

properly briefed and had obtained necessary instructions. At the same time

all the officers who had been selected for the raid were fully searched to

confirm that the said officers were not carrying any substance with them.

The team had left the bureau in a van bearing No. HG 2727.

4 | P a g e

Having reached Jayantha Weerasekera Mawatha the vehicle was stopped 75

meters before the Ruby Cinema Hall. The informant had arrived there around

17:35 hours and met the PW1. The above-mentioned three-wheeler had come

there at about 18:40 hours. Then PW1 and PW4 PC Asela had stopped the

said three-wheeler and checked the persons travelling in the vehicle. The

Appellant was in the driving seat while another person was seated in the rear

seat. Upon checking in the right-side trouser pocket of the Appellant PW1

had found a grocery bag containing some white coloured substance. As it

reacted for Heroin the Appellant was arrested immediately. The passenger

identified as Mohammed Murshid Anwer was also subjected to a body check

by PW4 but nothing was recovered from him. Although nothing had been

recovered from Mahammed Murshid Anwer, he too had been arrested and

both had been taken to the Police Narcotic Bureau around 20:45 hours.

Before arriving at the bureau, the police team had gone to Maligawatta to

check the boarding place of the Appellant but nothing was found there.

The substance contained in the parcel was weighed in front of the Appellant

at the Police Narcotic Bureau and the weight had been recorded as 31.2

grams. After parcelling was over, the productions were kept in the personal

locker of PW1 until it was handed over to PW7 IP Rajakaruna on

08/09/2011. The said production was marked as PR No.35/11. The three-

wheeler was also taken in to custody and was handed over to the reserve

police officer PC 50145 Priyankara under PR No.36/11.

PW7 IP Rajakaruna had handed over the production to the Government

Analyst Department on 11/09/2011. According to the Government Analyst

Report 8.93 grams of Heroin (diacetylmorphine) had been detected in the

parcel. After close of the prosecution case, the defence was called and the

Appellant had made a lengthy dock statement and closed his case. In his

dock statement the Appellant had stated that nothing was recovered from

him on that day. The recovery was done from Mohamed Murshid Anwer who

had hired his three-wheeler to go up to Ruby Cinema Hall that day. He

5 | P a g e

further said that the family members of the Mohamed Murshid had visited

the Police Narcotic Bureau while they were detained there for about seven

days. On the seventh day Mohamed Murshid Anwer was discharged after

producing him before Magistrate Court of Maligakanda. Thereafter only he

had come to know that the Heroin detected on Mohamed Murshid Anwer had

been introduced as if it was detected on him.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person and this burden never

shifts. Hence an accused person has no burden to prove his case unless he

pleads a general or a special exception in the Penal Code.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are

of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions.

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:

the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required in

a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree is

well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree of

probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond

the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it

admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the

evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility

in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence, of course it is

possible, but not in the least probable, the case is proved beyond

reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.

In the first ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the Learned Trial

Judge had failed to consider that the defence taken up by the Accused

Appellant that the heroin was in the possession of Mohamed Murshid Anwer

6 | P a g e

and he was released after his wife and others saw him at the PNB and

thereafter he was taken out of the PNB for alleged investigations.

It is the contention of the Appellant that the alleged drug parcel was

recovered from Mohamed Murshid Anwer and both had been arrested and

detained under a detention order of the court. According to PW1 Mohamed

Murshid Anwer was arrested on a charge of aiding and abetting along with

the Appellant and detained at the Police Narcotic Bureau under the court

order.

rfialr udjf;a iskud Yd,dj bosrsmsgoS w;awvx.=jg .;a;d Page 78 of the

brief.

Even though Mohamed Murshid Anwer was arrested on the charge of aiding

and abetting along with the Appellant, the prosecution led no evidence as to

what happened to him when the indictment was only preferred against the

Appellant. PW1 in his evidence stated that as the investigation revealed that

both the Appellant and Mohamed Murshid Anwer had been collectively

involved in drug trafficking, only Mohamed Murshid Anwer was taken to a

house addressed as No.139, Walpola, Batuwatte, Ragama in search of a

person called Charith Asanka. Mahamed Murshid Anwer was also taken to

Maradana, Rajagiriya, Malabe, Kadawatha and Biyagama for further

investigations. Even the further investigation was related to this case and he

was taken to several places, the PW1 had not been involved in the further

investigations conducted against Mohamed Murshid Anwer. This is very

strange conduct on the part of PW1.

Further not leading evidence pertaining to the exclusion of Mohamed

Murshid Anwer who was arrested along with the Appellant on the charge of

7 | P a g e

aiding and abetting the Appellant, I consider it a very serious lapse

occasioned on the part of the prosecution.

As the 2nd and 4th appeal grounds advanced by the Appellant pertain to the

leading of evidence by PW9 in the trial, the said grounds will be considered

in conjunction in this appeal.

PW1 has selected five officers from the bureau for the raid and they have

been lined up as witnesses PW2-PW6 in the indictment. During the trial it

was informed that PW4 Asela who had gone with PW1 to arrest the Appellant

and Mohamed Murshid Anwer, had deserted the Police Narcotic Bureau due

to unknown reasons. To corroborate PW1s evidence the prosecution had

called the Officer-in Charge of the Raiding Unit of the Police Narcotic Bureau

to give evidence upon the notes of PW4. To call the Officer-in-Charge of the

Raiding Unit, The State Counsel made the application under Section 32(2) of

the Evidence Ordinance. He has been named as PW9 in the indictment.

In the cross examination of PW9 the defence had highlighted that certain

important materials which are essential to corroborate the evidence of PW1

had not been found in the notes of PW4. As a result, the evidence given by

PW1 stands uncorroborated on material points.

Further the prosecution without calling the other officers who had gone for

the raid, had called the Officer-in-Charge of the Raiding Unit of the Police

Narcotic Bureau to give evidence upon the notes of the PW4. This is an

unusual practice, which will certainly lead to a casting of doubt on the

prosecution evidence.

Now I consider whether the conviction in this case can be upheld considering

only the evidence of PW1. In support of this I consider the case of

Devundarage Nihal v. AG SC. Appeal No.15 of 2010 decided on 12/05/201.

In this case Sureschandra J held that:

Therefore, it is quite clear that unlike in the case where an accomplice

or a decoy is concerned in any other case there is no requirement in law

8 | P a g e

that the evidence of a Police Officer who conducts an investigation or raid

resulting in the arrest of an offender need to be corroborated in material

particulars. However, caution must be exercised by a trial judge in

evaluating such evidence and arriving at a conclusion against an

offender. It cannot be stated as a rule of thumb that the evidence of a

police witness in a drug related offence must be corroborated in material

particulars where police officers are the key witnesses.

In the case of Chacko Alias Aniyan Kunju & others v. State of Kerala-

[2004] INSC 87 (21st January 2004) held that:

The provision clearly states that no particular number of witnesses is

required to establish the case. Conviction can be based on the testimony

of a single witness if he is wholly reliable. Corroboration may be

necessary when he is partially reliable. If the evidence is unblemished

and beyond all possible criticism and the Court is satisfied that the

witness was speaking the truth then on his evidence alone conviction

can be maintained.

In this case PW1 is the key witness in this case. If his evidence is clear,

cogent and unambiguous the court could without any hesitation rely on his

evidence and convict the Appellant in the absence of any corroboration. But

as discussed above the evidence given by PW1, in my view, has not passed

the probability test. It is tainted with much ambiguity and uncertainty which

definitely affect the root of the case.

In Iswari Prasad v. Mohamed Isa 1963 AIR (SC) 1728 at 1734 His Lordship

held that;

In considering whether evidence given by a witness should be accepted

or not, the court has to examine whether he is, in fact, an interested

witness and to inquire whether the story deposed to by him is probable

and whether it has been shaken in cross-examination. That is whether

there is a ring of truth surrounding his testimony.

9 | P a g e

Justice Mackenna in Discretion, The Irish Jurist, Vol.IX (new series), 1

at 10 has said;

When I have done my best to separate the true from the false by these

more or less objective tests, I say which story seems to me the more

probable, the plaintiffs or the defendants, and If I cannot say which, I

decide the case, as the law requires me to do in the defendants favour.

In the case of Sinniah Kalidasa v. The Hon. Attorney General CA/

128/2005 BASL Criminal Law 2010 Vol.111 page 31 in which Justice

Ranjith Silva quotes E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in the Law of Evidence Volume

2 Book 1 at page 395 dealing with how police evidence in bribery cases

should be considered;

In the great many cases, the police are, as a rule unreliable witnesses.

It is always in their interests to secure a conviction in the hope of getting

a reward. Such evidence ought, therefore, to be received with great

caution and should be closely scrutinized

Ranjith Silva J states;

By the same token the same principles should apply and guide the

judges in the assessment of the evidence of excise officers in narcotic

cases. Judges must not rely on a non- existent presumption of

truthfulness and regularity as regards the evidence of such trained

police or excise officers.

Guided by the above cited judgments and writing in this case the Learned

High Court Judge should not have relied on PW1s evidence in this case.

Hence this appeal ground has a very serious impact on the prosecution case.

Further even though the dock statement of an accused has less evidential

value our courts never hesitated to accept the same when it creates a doubt

on the prosecution case. In this case I consider it is very important to

consider the dock statement of the Appellant.

10 | P a g e

Right to make an unsworn dock statement is recognized in several cases in

our jurisdiction. Few of them are mentioned bellow.

In Queen v. Buddharakkita Thero and others 63 NLR 433 the court held

that:

the right of an accused person to make an unsworn statement from the

dock is recognised in our law. That right would be of no value unless

such a statement is treated as evidence on behalf of the accused, subject

however to the infirmity which attaches to statements that are unsworn

and have not been tested by cross-examination.

In Kathubdeen v. Republic of Sri Lanka [1998] 3 SLR 107 the court held

that:

It is settled law that an unsworn statement must be treated as

evidence. It has also been laid down that if the unsworn statement

creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case or if it is believed,

then the accused should be given the benefit of that doubt.

In his dock statement the Appellant had stated that on the date of arrest his

three-wheeler was hired by Mohamed Murshid Anwer to go towards Ruby

Cinema Hall in Maligawatte. At that time Mohamed Murshid Anwers

daughter aged two and half years also came with them. When Mohamed

Murshid Anwer directed the three-wheeler to be halted near the Ruby

Theatre, two persons who introduced themselves as police officers had got in

from the either side of the three-wheeler and demanded goods from

Mohamed Murshid Anwer after assaulting him. Then Mohamed Mursid

Anwer was taken out from the three-wheeler and searched. Thereafter he

had heard the police officers saying that goods were found. As Mohamed

Murshid Anwers daughter started to cry, the police officers got into his

three-wheeler along with Mohamed Murshid Anwer and went to his house to

drop his daughter. The appellant was shifted into a police vehicle at that

time. The police vehicle had proceeded to a lonely place on the Lake House

11 | P a g e

Road and the officers had inquired about his acquaintance with Mohamed

Murshid Anwer. He had stated that it was the first time he went on a hire

with Mohamed Murshid Anwer on that day. At that time the other police

officers had arrived after dropping Mohamed Murshid Anwers daughter.

Both had been taken to Armour Street but only Mohamed Murshid Anwer

had been made to accompany the officers on the house searches thereafter.

Therefore, the appellant was not taken for the house searches at that time.

Thereafter they had been taken to Police Narcotic Bureau, his signature

obtained on a white coloured paper and had been detained there for seven

days in two separate cells. Mohamed Murshid Anwers wife and family

members had visited him during his detention almost every day and had

maintained friendly chats with the officers at Police Narcotic Bureau. During

this time Mohamed Murshid Anwer was taken out several times for further

investigation. He was neither taken along with Mohamed Murshid Anwer nor

has he been allowed visits from his family members. After his detention

period was over, he was produced before the Magistrate and remanded for

this case. After that only had he come to know that Mohamed Murshid Anwer

had been discharged form this case. According to him he was remanded

instead of Mohamed Murshid Anwer.

As discussed above, the conduct of PW1 after the arrest of the Appellant and

Mohamed Murshid Anwer was very suspicious. Both had been taken to and

detained at the Police Narcotic Bureau. But only the Appellant was taken to

various places for further investigation not by the PW1 and his team but by

a new team of the Police Narcotic Bureau. This position was admitted by PW1

in his evidence. The Appellant had never been taken out for the further

investigations. Even though, as claimed by the police the Heroin pertaining

to this case was detected from the Appellant, further investigation was not

done as to clarify the method of transfer of Heroin to the Appellant. This

lethargic conduct of the police creates a serious doubt in the prosecution

case.

12 | P a g e

The third ground of appeal is devoid of any merit as the counsel for the

Appellant on 24/05/2017 had expressed his willingness to admit the

proceedings led before the former High Court Judge under Section 48 of the

Judicature Act when the Learned High Court Judge continued the trial.

In this case evidence presented by the prosecution maintained complete

silence regarding the arrest and discharge of Mohamed Murshid Anwer.

Prosecution witnesses have deviated from their routine practice when

providing evidence during trial. Hence a reasonable doubt has been created

on the prosecution case. Hence, I consider this to be an appropriate case to

award the benefit of the doubt to the Appellant.

Due to aforesaid reasons, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed

by the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 05/04/2018 on the

Appellant. Therefore, he is acquitted from the second charge.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court

of Colombo along with the original case record.
