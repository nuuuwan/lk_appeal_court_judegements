In cross examination the appellant has not challenged the evidence of the PW1. The appellant has only taken up the position that the deceased was against a love affair he had with a relative of the deceased and also that there was a rift between them about a money transaction. Even in the statement the appellant made from the dock, he has not denied that he told the PW1 that he killed the deceased. Hence, as rightly concluded by the learned High Court Judge, the only inference that could be drawn from the proved circumstances is that the appellant inflicted the injury that caused the death of the deceased and it was no one else. Hence, the first ground of appeal fails as it is devoid of merit. 8. The learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that, as the evidence shows",
