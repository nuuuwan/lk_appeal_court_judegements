WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The accused-appellant was indicted on three counts. He was acquitted

on the first and third counts, but convicted and sentenced on the

second count. The second count is for fraudulently or dishonestly

using as genuine, a document that he knew or had reason to believe

to be a forged document by handing over a cheque valued at

Rs. 480,000 to Joseph Thambirajah, Manager of the Hatton National

Bank, Chetty Street, an offence punishable under section 454 read

with 459 of the Penal Code.

At the time of the incident, the accused-appellant was a peon employed

in the Colombo Municipal Council. He was attached to the Accounts

Division of the Municipal Treasurers Department. According to the

prosecution, two cheques marked 1 and 2 which purported to be

forged cheques, were credited into two separate accounts at the Seylan

3

Bank and Hatton National Bank. P1 is the cheque relating to the

second count that was presented to the Hatton National Bank.

Evidence had been led to establish that the account in HNB has been

opened in the name of one Murdala Ralalage Kumara Wijesighe. Such

a person, however, could not be found. The cheque for Rs.480,000/-,

marked P1, had been deposited into this account and subsequently,

Rs.455,000/- was withdrawn. The representative from the Registration

of Persons Department stated that they had not issued the Identity

Card that was found to have been presented to the HNB in the course

of opening the said account. Although the second count was that, use

of a cheque bearing number 015197, which the appellant had reason

to believe to be a forged document, the said cheque was not sent to the

EQD for examination. In proving the second charge, the prosecution

relied on mandate card, deposits and withdrawal slips. The EQDs

opinion was that the handwriting on the mandate card, deposit slips,

and withdrawal slips (which were marked as P1 to P5 and P10, when

sent to the EQD) is similar to the specimen handwriting of the accused-

appellant.

Written submissions have been filed on behalf of both parties prior to

the hearing of the appeal. At the hearing, the learned Presidents

Counsel for the appellant and the learned Deputy Solicitor General for

the respondent made oral submissions. At the outset of his

submissions, the learned President's Counsel informed the court that

he would pursue only one ground of appeal. The said ground is

whether there is enough evidence to connect the accused-appellant to

the offence.

While not admitting it, the learned Presidents Counsel did not

challenge the correctness of the EQDs opinion stated in his report.

The contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant was

that the EQDs opinion could only be used as corroborative evidence

4

and there was no substantive evidence to prove the second charge

against the appellant. Therefore, he contended that the accused-

appellant should be acquitted of the second count as well, because

there is no evidence that the appellant used a forged document as

genuine.

The second count to which the appellant was convicted is using as

genuine a forged document. EQD formed his opinion that the aforesaid

documents tendered to the Hatton National Bank were forged

documents. As the EQDs opinion is not an issue in this appeal, this

court has to consider whether the appellant used the cheque bearing

the number 015197 knowing that it was a forged document.

Apart from the EQD report, the only items of evidence against the

appellant, as admitted by the learned Deputy Solicitor General and the

learned President's Counsel, are evidence that the appellant had the

opportunity to tender the forged document to the bank and evidence

of his subsequent conduct, namely that on 01.01.1997, the day this

fraud was detected, the accused left his workplace early and failed to

report to work after 01.01.1997. It is to be noted that the

aforementioned two matters create only suspicion, and this evidence

does not establish the fact that he used a forged document as genuine.

It was held in Queen V. Sumanasena 66 NLR 351 that suspicious

circumstances do not establish guilt. Nor does the proof of any number

of suspicious circumstances relieve the prosecution of its burden of

proving the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt and

compel the accused to give or call evidence. The burden of establishing

circumstances which not only establish the accuseds guilt but are also

inconsistent with his innocence remains on the prosecution

throughout the trial.

According to this decision, the aforesaid two items of evidence that

create only a suspicion could not be conclusively used to prove the

5

second charge. Therefore, I proceed to consider the legal issue of

whether the appellant could only be convicted on the EQDs opinion

without any other evidence being adduced to establish that the

appellant used forged documents.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General contended that EQD's evidence

is scientific evidence and that the second charge could be proved on

his report in the same manner that a rape case is proved on a doctor's

Medico-Legal report and a murder case is proved on a Judicial Medical

Officer's post-mortem report. The learned Deputy Solicitor General

contended further that the EQD's expert opinion could be considered

as conclusive proof.

Now, I wish to consider the decided authorities in respect of the expert

opinion. In the case of Chandrasena alias Rale V. Attorney General

(2008) 2 Sri L.R. 255 it was held that A medical witness called in as

an expert is not a witness of fact. His evidence is really of an advisory

character given on the facts submitted to him. Whilst the opinion of

expert being a guide to Court, it is the Court which must come to its

own conclusion with regard to the issues of the case. A Court is not

justified in delegating its function to an expert and acting solely on

latter's opinion.

It is to be noted that in a rape case, the doctor can express his or her

opinion on whether sexual intercourse has taken place or not. He

could sometimes express his opinion on whether some sort of violence

had occurred. However, the issue of whether the accused in that case

committed the rape has to be decided based on the other evidence. In

a murder case, the Judicial Medical Officer could express his opinion

on whether it was a natural death or a crime, the nature of the crime,

and the cause of death. Evidence of other witnesses should be

adduced to determine whether it is a murder or culpable homicide not

amounting to murder or death caused by negligence. In addition, the

6

fact that the offence has been committed by the accused should also

be proved by the other evidence. Therefore, in the instant action too, it

has to be proved by the evidence of other witnesses that the accused

committed the offence set out in the indictment and no one else.

In the case of A. Gratiaen Perera V. The Queen 61 NLR 522 identical

issue, hand-writing experts evidence regarding a forgery has been

discussed and held that where a hand-writing expert testifies of

forgery, his testimony should be accepted only if there is some other

evidence, direct or circumstantial which tends to show that the

conclusion reached by the expert is correct. The relevant portion of

the decision of Mendis V. Jayasuriya (1930) 12 C.L.R 44 has been

cited in this case as follows: Akbar J. took the view that the expert

evidence should be used only in corroboration of a conclusion arrived

at independently and not to convict a person on a charge of forgery if

the other evidence is not conclusive. It would create some kind of

suspicion but would not go beyond it. This is the answer to the issue

we're discussing. The expert's opinion is basically corroborating. Other

substantive evidence is needed to convict an accused of forgery or

using a forged document as genuine. As previously stated, no such

evidence has been adduced in this case.

In the case of H. A. Charles Perera and another V. M. L. Motha and

another 65 NLR 294 also it was held that The evidence of a

handwriting expert must be treated as only a relevant fact and not as

conclusive of the fact of genuineness or otherwise of the hand-writing

in question. The experts opinion is relevant but only in order to enable

the Judge himself to form his own opinion.

In Samarakoon V. The Public Trustee 65 NLR 100, it was held that

on an issue of forgery, the court may accept a hand-writing experts

testimony, provided that there is some other evidence, direct or

7

circumstantial, which tends to show that the conclusion reached by

the expert is correct.

In the case of Lily Perera V. Chandani Perera and others (1990) 1 Sri

L.R. 246 it was held that the evidence of the hand-writing expert is a

relevant fact but will to use only to assist the Judge himself to form

his opinion.

The following portion stated in this Judgment is also important

to determine the issue before us. The law of evidence 2nd Edition

(1989) Volume 1 in summing up the effect of the authorities, E. R. S. R.

Coomaraswamy (on page 627) states thus: The correct position as to

the value of the evidence of the hand-writing expert seems to be that

his evidence must be treated as a relevant fact and not as conclusive

of the fact of genuineness or otherwise of the hand-writing: His opinion

is relevant but only in order to enable the Judge himself to form his

opinion. (Charles Perera V. Motha) (1961) 65 N.L.R. 294 at 296, State

of Gujarat V. Vinaya Lal Pathi AIR (1967) S.C. 778; (1967) Crim L.J.

668.

In Charles de Silva V. Ariyawathie de Silva and another (1987) 1 Sri

L.R. 261 it was held that Evidence of a handwriting expert is to be

considered only as relevant fact and not conclusive of the genuineness

or otherwise of the handwriting in dispute and that it is only relevant

to enable the Judge to form his opinion.

It is apparent from the aforesaid long line of Judicial Authorities that

the experts evidence is only relevant evidence of advisory character.

Expert evidence should only be used to corroborate. However, in order

to reach a conclusion, there must be some other evidence, either direct

or circumstantial. Therefore, I agree with the contention of the learned

Presidents Counsel that the accused-appellant could not be convicted

for this offence only on an experts evidence without any substantial

evidence being adduced to establish that the aforesaid forged

8

documents have been used by the appellant. As explained previously,

the only other evidence adduced in this case does not infer that the

appellant used forged documents but creates only a suspicion. In view

of the decisions of the aforesaid judicial authorities, I regret that I am

unable to agree with the contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor

General that the experts evidence and opinion could be considered as

conclusive proof.

Apart from the aforesaid two matters that raise only suspicion, HNB

Managers evidence is also vital in coming to a conclusion in this case.

Giving evidence on behalf of the prosecution, he said that his officer in

the bank who handled the work relating to the opening of the

questionable account had checked the identity card and confirmed the

identity of the account holder, Murdala Ralalage Kumara Wijesighe.

Confirmed the identification means that the said officer had obtained

confirmation that the photograph on the National Identity Card

produced to the bank is that of the person who came to the bank to

open the account. The Bank Manager also stated that a photocopy of

the identity card is retained with the bank. However, the prosecution

never claimed that the identity card used to open the account at the

bank contained the appellant's photograph. If that were the case, the

prosecution could easily produce a copy of the identity card kept by

the bank and show that the appellant came to open the account using

a forged document. Hence, it is apparent a person called Wijesinghe or

somebody else appeared by the name of Wijesinghe submitted the

forged document to the bank but certainly not the appellant. In the

circumstances, it is apparent that rather than corroborate EQD's

opinion, this prosecution witness contradicts EQD's opinion because

this bank manager's evidence indicates that someone else other than

the appellant submitted the forged application (mandate card) to the

bank to open the account.

9

For the reasons stated above, I hold that the second count against the

appellant has also not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Accordingly, I allow the appeal and set aside the conviction and

sentence dated 22.03.2019 imposed on the second count by the

learned High Court Judge and direct that the accused-appellant be

acquitted of the Second Count.

The appeal is allowed.
