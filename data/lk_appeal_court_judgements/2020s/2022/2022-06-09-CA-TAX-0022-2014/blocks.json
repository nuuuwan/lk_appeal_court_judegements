The Appellant designs advertisements for its clients which need to be published/communicated to the people. According to the Appellant, since the Appellant does not own a media institution, the Appellant introduces those clients to the media. According to the Appellant thereafter those clients become the clients of media. The Appellant contended that upon D 4 and D 6, media have the right to receive the dues from the clients and the clients are bound to make the payments to media. The Appellant argued that the demand made directly from the clients by the media establishes the fact that the clients are of media and not of the Appellant. The document tendered by the appellant with the motion dated 20th July 2015 is a summary of accounts, indicating the amounts owed by the Appellant to the media as at 11th June 2011. The media requests the Appellant to settle the identical amount stated in D 6, within the credit period to avoid suspension of the credit facilities offered to the Appellant. Hence, it is apparent that the contract is between the Appellant and media and D 4 only guarantees the payment to the media by the client, in the event the Appellant defaults. Therefore, initially, payments to the media arise out of invoices issued by the Appellant and a claim on the Letter of Guarantee will only occur in the event of failure. Therefore, in my view, the TAC erred in holding that D 4 merely authorizes the media institution to accept advertising materials furnished by the Appellant company to be published in the name of the client. However, this misstatement of fact has not affected the final determination of the TAC. Moreover, it is significant that in the letter of guarantee the client has described the Appellant as their agent and not as the agent of media, as stated by the Appellant. Further, in view of the above facts, it appears to me that although the client has guaranteed payments to media for advertising done in respect of their business, the Appellant is the one who dealt with the media, acting as agent of the client.",

No doubt this rule is neither conclusive nor of general application and is to be applied with great caution. It may be applied only when in the natural association of ideas, the contract between what is provided and what is left out leads to an inference that the latter was intended to be excluded. Very often particular words are used by way of abundant caution, and the application of the maxim becomes inadvisable. On the above analysis, it is my considered view that the words relevant turnover in Section 2 (1) of the ESC Act should mean the total amount received by the Appellant, irrespective of the fact that a portion of it has to be paid back to the media institution (hereinafter referred to as the media).",

However, the term to be interpreted in the instant case is not profit but, turnover. It was also cited Gresham Life Assurance Society v. Bishop27 where Lord Lindley observed that a mere entry in an account which does not represent such a transaction does not prove any receipt whatever else it may be worth. However, in the case in hand the issue is not on profit and it is the relevant turnover in terms of ESC Act, where the word turnover is interpreted within the Act itself.
