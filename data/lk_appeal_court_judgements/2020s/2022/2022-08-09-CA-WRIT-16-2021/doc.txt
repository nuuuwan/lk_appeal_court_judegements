Before : Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

Dhammika Ganepola J.

Counsel : Chamara Nanayakkarawasam for the Petitioner. Shemanthi Dunuwille, SC for the Respondents. Supported on : 15.12.2021, 20.07.2022

Decided on : 09.08.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The 1st Petitioner was carrying out a business of selling building material such as sand,

metal and cement. Subsequently, the sole proprietorship of the 1st Petitioner was converted

to the 2nd Petitioner Company. The said business was established on a land of 20.7 perches

owned by the 1st Petitioner situated in the above address.

An extent of 0.0126 hectares of the 1st Petitioners land was acquired in or around 2013 by

the State for expansion of the Horana-Colombo road. The Petitioners state that their land

is depicted as Lot 109 in the Preliminary Plan No. 4340 and the portion thereof acquired

by the State is depicted as Lot A in the Tracing No. Ka/SGO/17/715. The 1st Petitioner

has accepted compensation for such acquisition as per the decision of the Acquiring

Officer, marked as P10.

The portion of land facing the Petitioners land which is on the other side of the road was

a vacant State land. The said portion of land is considered as the land subjected to this

application. Petitioners contention is that if the road expansion took place acquiring the

said vacant land and then it would not be necessary to acquire the land of the 1st Petitioner

for the road expansion. Thus, the 1st Petitioner by his letter dated 12.05.2013, marked P7

has made such suggestions to the Divisional Secretary of Horana. Anyhow, the road

construction has proceeded despite such proposals of the Petitioner.

Meantime, the Chairman of the RDA on the request of the Petitioner, has granted

permission for the Petitioner to make use of the said subject land which is in extent of

0.1035 hectares for temporary storage of building material. Such permission has been

Page 3 of 4

granted only for a period of 6 months. On the lapse of the aforementioned 6 months, a

letter dated 23.04.2019, marked P16 was issued by the Assistant Divisional Secretary of

Horana directing the 1st Petitioner to remove the building material from the subject State

land.

Consequently, the 1st Petitioner addressed a letter to the Chairman of RDA dated

29.04.2019, requesting the Chairman to grant the said subject land to the 1st Petitioner on

a long term lease. The 1st Petitioner contends that the said Chairman has agreed to direct

his officers to take necessary steps in respect of his request.

As the Petitioner fails to hand over the vacant possession of the subject land which belongs

to State, the Divisional Secretary of Horana issued quit notices twice under the State Land

(Recovery of Possession) Act against the 1st Petitioner. Accordingly, the Petitioners are

seeking, inter alia, in the instant application for a mandate in the nature of a writ of

Certiorari quashing the quit notices marked P20 and P25 and also a mandate in the

nature of a writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to 4th Respondents to grant the subject land

or an alternative land on a long term lease.

The Sections 4 and 5 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 (as

amended) deal with quit notices issued under the said Act. In terms of Section 9 of the

said Act, the person who is in possession of the State Land will not be entitled to contest

any of the matters under Section 5, in an inquiry before a Magistrates Court under the

said Act. This Court exercising its jurisdictions in terms of Article 140 is entitled to

consider the reasonableness or the legality of the basis on which the competent authority

formed any opinion under the said Act or any blatant error in respect of the quit notice or

of the relevant process. However, the Petitioner has not submitted any viable ground of

review in view of challenging the impugned quit notices marked P20 and P25.

The Petitioner's contention is that although the Chairman and the senior officers of the

RDA were concerned about the Petitioners hardships, the 4th Respondent was adamant

and was maliciously acting to evict the Petitioners from the said land without considering

the grant of a long term lease. Further, the Petitioners assert that although the Petitioner

made repeated representations to obtain the said subject land or an alternative land on

long term lease, the 1st Respondent was acting arbitrarily on the instigation of the 4th

Page 4 of 4

Respondent who was not in good terms with the 1st Petitioner in particular because of the

political opinion held by the Petitioner.

However, I am not satisfied that the Petitioner has provided cogent & sufficient evidence

and material in this application in order to establish malice on the part of the 1st and the

4th Respondents. Sripavan J. in Bandaranayake vs. Judicial Service Commission (2003)

3 Sri. L.R. 101 has held that the Court will not in general entertain allegations of bad

faith made against the repository of power, unless bad faith has been expressly pleaded

and properly enumerated in detail.

On a careful consideration of the documentation tendered by the Petitioners, it is apparent,

that the Petitioner has been allowed to use the subject State Land only on temporary basis

for the storage of building material. Though the Petitioners have made representations to

the relevant authorities requesting the said subject land to be given to him on a long term

lease, none of the authorities have officially agreed to such requests.

The Chairmans (of RDA) authority to grant temporary permission for the 1st Petitioner

to occupy the subject state land is also, in my view, questionable. Granting of State land

on lease or otherwise for a short/long term should be done according to the written laws

relating to State lands. The material submitted by the 1st Petitioner to establish his

expectation to get the subject land on a long term lease is not strong enough for this Court

to exercise its writ jurisdiction to grant a prerogative remedy quashing the impugned quit

notices. In the circumstances, I refuse to issue formal notice of this application on the

Respondents as the Petitioner has failed to submit a prima facie case. Application is

refused.
