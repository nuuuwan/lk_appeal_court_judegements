R. Gurusinghe, J.

The Accused Appellant (the Appellant) was indicted in the High Court of

Tangalle for committing the murder of one Loku Yaddehige Rajika on or

about the 15th of October 2012 at Kudawella, an offence punishable in

terms of section 296 of the Penal Code.

The appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge and preferred to have the

Trial before the Learned High Court Judge without a jury.

The prosecution led the evidence of PW1, PW2, PW3, PW6, PW8, PW4,

PW5 and the Court Translator.

The appellant made the dock statement.

At the conclusion of the trial the appellant was convicted as charged and

3

was sentenced to death. The appellant preferred this appeal against the

said conviction and sentence.

Briefly, the facts of the case are as follows;

On the day of the incident when the deceased and his son PW1 was at

home, the appellant had come to the deceaseds house around 10.00 in

the morning and demanded for some amount of money from her. The

deceased, however was not ready to give him money and she went to the

kitchen to prepare lunch. While she was washing rice, the appellant had

come to the kitchen and poured kerosene oil on the deceased and lit a

match stick and the deceased was engulfed in flames. Thereafter, the

appellant had fled the house where the incident took place. PW1 who

witnessed the incident had shouted and PW3 had come to the scene and

discovered that the deceased had been engulfed in fire. Then, he had

extinguished the fire by pouring water and took the deceased to the

Matara General Hospital. Later on, she had been transferred from there

to Colombo. As per the evidence of PW3 and her husband PW2, the

deceased had told both of them that the appellant had set her on fire

after pouring kerosene oil. The police witness, with the permission of the

doctor and the nurse on duty, had recorded a statement from the

deceased when she was in the Matara General Hospital. In her

statement to the police, the deceased had stated that the appellant

poured kerosene oil over her body and set fire.

The grounds of appeal set forth on behalf of the appellant are as follows;

I. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider Evidence of

Solitary Eye Witness who is a child, cannot be accepted due to

following reasons:

4

A. Testimony of Solitary Eye Witness (11 years of age) was not

corroborated by medical evidence.

B. Testimony of Solitary Eye Witness was contradicted by the

so-called Dying Declaration made by the deceased.

C. When there are ample opportunities for the prosecution to

record a statement from the child on the day of the incident,

they have failed to do so. Therefore, the possibility of tutoring

the child witness cannot be totally ruled out.

D. Behaviour of the child witness is not natural.

II. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the inherent

weaknesses of the purported Dying Declaration of the deceased.

III. The Learned High Court Judge has seriously erred in appreciating

the evidence of other prosecution witnesses, including Doctor

Dona Indra Malini Ratnayake (JMO), who had performed the post-

mortem on the person of the deceased.

IV. The Learned Trial Judge has not taken into his consideration that

the First Information does not contain the name of the accused-

appellant.

V. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the fact that

the prosecution did not call medical reports of the accused-

appellant and therefore, the accused-appellant has been denied

the right to a fair trial.

VI. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that the probability

of suicide cannot be totally ruled out.

5

VII. Prosecutions failure to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt has

not been considered in a Judicial perspective by the Learned Trial

Judge.

PW1 was an 11-year-old boy at the time of the incident. He had stayed at

home with the deceased on the day of the incident as he was not well

enough to go to school. In giving evidence, PW1 had narrated the

incident to the court. He described the way the appellant poured

kerosene oil over his mother and the way how he had set her on fire and

how the appellant fled the place. PW1 further stated that he rushed to

PW3 exclaiming as to what had happened. PW3 had then run to the

scene and extinguished the fire and had taken the deceased to the

hospital.

It was submitted for the appellant that the testimony of a solitary eye

witness was not corroborated in material particulars by the evidence of

independent sources. Further, it was argued that the evidence of PW1

was contradicted by the medical evidence and the police evidence.

However, this argument was not factually correct. The doctor was of the

opinion that the kerosene oil was poured on the deceased persons body.

Whereas, PW1s evidence reveals that the appellant had poured kerosene

oil from the back of his mother and the oil spilled all over her body. I do

not see any significant difference here. The point argued by the appellant

is whether the kerosene oil was poured on the head of the deceased or

the body of the deceased. It was proved by the evidence that eighty-one

percent of the body of the deceased was burnt. It was quite clear that the

evidence of PW1 is that , was correct. All these

actions had been taken place in a pretty unexpected manner and in a

rapid succession. There is no considerable contradiction concerning the

evidence of PW1 and the evidence of PW1 is corroborated by the evidence

of the doctor.

6

Section 118 of the Evidence Ordinance is as follows:

118. All persons shall be competent to testify unless the court

considers that they are prevented from understanding the

questions put to them, or from giving rational answers to those

questions. By tender years, extreme old age, disease, whether of

body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind.

The children are not excluded as incompetent to give evidence. The

argument is that the evidence of a child must be corroborated on

material particulars which can be considered as a matter of prudence

and not as a requirement of law. In this particular case, PW1 was 11

years old at the time of the incident. He was capable of understanding

the questions posed to him and of giving rational answers to the same.

This shows undoubtedly that PW1 is a competent witness.

The next argument is that PW1s statement was not recorded on the day

of the incident. PW1 could not have gone to the police station on his own

as there was no other senior person in the house to accompany him to

the police station, as his father had gone to the Matara General Hospital

on the day of the incident. However, the statement of PW1 was recorded

at the Tangalle police station on the following day at 8.00a.m. Thus, it

cannot be considered as a delayed statement, as it was made within a 24

hour period of the incident. Therefore, the above mentioned argument

has no merit.

The next argument is that the behavior of the child (PW1) is not natural

and his testimony is improbable. The basis for the aforementioned

argument is that there is no evidence to show whether or not PW1

shouted in between the two events, that is namely, pouring kerosene oil

and igniting the match stick. Therefore it is inferred that he had not

seen the incident. However, all those actions took place in rapid

7

succession, where PW1 had no time to shout and alert his mother.

Further, The appellant himself stated in his dock statement that PW1

was also present. Therefore, it can be concluded that the argument

raised by the Counsel to the appellant was untenable and unreasonable.

It was further argued that PW1 had not made any effort to extinguish the

fire by pouring water. As mentioned earlier, PW1 was 11 years old at that

time, and he had also stayed at home as he was not well and therefore,

he must have lacked physical strength to act quickly. However, PW1 had

run to the next door and got the help of his uncle PW3 (sometimes

referred to as PW11). It can be regarded as the most natural and

reasonable course for a child of that age to follow in a fearsome incident.

Thus, I see no merit in this argument.

The next ground of appeal is that the Learned High Court Judge has

failed to consider the inherent weaknesses of a dying declaration.

The medical evidence established the fact that the deceased had the

ability to speak, and she had been conscious. PW3 in his evidence

testified that the deceased made a dying declaration to him while taking

her to the hospital. It was further revealed from the evidence that she

had also made a dying declaration to her husband while she was taking

treatment in the hospital. The police officer had also recorded a

statement containing the dying declaration from the deceased while she

was in the Matara General Hospital.

The dying declaration is as follows:

The deceased had also stated to her husband that

Hence it is understandable from the evidence that all three dying

declarations are the same, and there is no inconsistency. Furthermore,

PW1 in his evidence testified that he had seen the appellant pouring

kerosene oil over his mother and setting her on fire. Thus it shows that

the dying declarations are not the only evidence regarding the incident,

but it is corroborated by the evidence of PW1.

9

It was argued for the appellant that PW6 the police officer, had not

recorded statements from the doctor or nurse who was on duty, at the

time when he recorded the statement from the deceased. PW6 had

recorded a statement from the deceased after consulting the doctor and

nurse who were on duty. As per his evidence, the statement was

recorded on the sixteenth. The deceased died on the twentieth. Had the

deceased survived, this statement would have been only a statement. The

Learned Trial Judge has cited from the Bench Book Law of Evidence,

the Law of Evidence E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, Ranjit vs. The State

2000 3 SLR 346 and two other cases in considering the applicable law

regarding dying declarations.

The Learned Trial Judge has considered the dying declaration with

caution.

The counsel for the appellant argues that if the deceased had made a

dying declaration, the husband PW2, should have made a complaint to

the police on the same day. Instead, he had sent someone else to

complain to the police. This argument is not only untenable, but also

unreasonable. When his wife is severely burnt, he naturally has to give

attention to his wife rather than going to the police. The evidence of PW1,

an eyewitness, is sufficient to support the conviction.

The fourth ground of appeal is that the first information does not contain

the name of the appellant. This argument is factually incorrect. The

police message from the police post of the Matara General Hospital was

received by the Tangalle Police Station at 2.00 pm on the fifteenth of

October 2002, which contained the name of the appellant. Therefore, I

hold that this argument has no merit at all.

The fifth ground of appeal is that the prosecution failed to call a medical

report of the appellant and thereby denied a fair trial. This argument has

10

not been elaborated in the written submission or oral arguments. I do

not see any prejudice caused to the appellant when considering the

defense. The appellant could have made an application to call for a

medical report if he had wished to.

The sixth ground of appeal is that the Learned Trial Judge has failed to

consider the possibility of a suicide, which cannot be ruled out. The

defense never suggested to any of the witnesses that the death of the

deceased was a suicide. This position came out from the dock statement

of the appellant for the first time. The appellant admitted that he was at

the deceased house at the time of the incident. The presence of PW1 was

also admitted.

In the case of Galagamage Indrawansa Kumarasiri and others vs

Honorable Attorney General SC TBA appeal No. 02/2012, decided on

2/4/2014, a Divisional Bench of the Supreme Court stated the following:

Dadimuni Indrasena & Dadimuni Wimalasena v AG (2008)

where it was stated that Whenever the evidence given by a

witness on a material point is not challenged in cross-examination

it has to be concluded that such evidence is not disputed and is

accepted by the opponent. This principle is echoed in Pilippu

Mandige Nalaka Krishantha Kumara Tissera v. AG (2007) and is

line with the approach adopted by Indian Courts as well as

evidenced by the decisions in Sarwan Singh v State of Punjab

(2002) (AIR SC 111) where it was held that It is a rule of essential

justice that whenever the opponent has declined to avail himself of

the opportunity to put his case in cross examination, it must follow

that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted, and

in Motilal v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1990) (CLJ NOC 125 MP)

which held that. the Absence of cross examination of Prosecution

11

Witnesses of certain facts leads to inference of admission of that

fact.

If the deceased tried to commit suicide, there is no reason for the

appellant to flee that place where the incident took place. Counsel for the

appellant argued that the 11-year old PW1 could have poured water on

the deceased and extinguished the fire. However, it can be commented on

the fact that the appellant being an adult, he could have done the same

instead of fleeing the place. There was nothing to suggest that the

incident was a suicide. The appellants position in the dock statement

was not put to PW1 or any other witnesses. Therefore, this argument

cannot be accepted.

The final and alternative argument is that The Learned Trial Judge has

failed to consider the availability of the defense of sudden provocation

which can be seen from the permitted dying declaration.

Counsel for the appellant quoted the following statement of the deceased:

.

. The argument is that if this

portion is believed, there should have been a struggle or altercation

between the appellant and the deceased. However, to establish the

ingredients to come within the general exception of a grave and sudden

provocation was not visible from the evidence. The defence never

suggested or posed any question to any of the witnesses on this basis.

The Learned Trial Judge could not have considered such a defense

without sufficient evidence. Therefore this argument is not sustainable.

In the above circumstances, it is evident that there is sufficient evidence

to support the conviction of the appellant. There is no reason to interfere

12

with the findings of the Learned Trial Judge of the High Court of

Tangalle.

We affirm the conviction and the sentence dated 05.12.2020.

The appeal is dismissed.
