MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to set aside the order of the High Court of

Badulla dated 14/07/2021.

The suspect in this matter had been arrested on 09/10/2020 for an offence of

theft of an automatic weapon from the production room of the Magistrates Court

of Badulla while being an employee of the same. The charges have been filed

under the offences against Public Property Act No.12 of 1982 under which,

according to Section 8(1) of the said Act Any person charged under this Act shall

not be released on bail until the trial has concluded but the Magistrate has to

Page 4 of 7

grant bail to a suspect on exceptional circumstances.In that event, a Police

Officer not below the rank of a Superintendent of Police has to file a certificate

stating that the value of the property of which the offence has been committed is

more than Rs.25, 000.

In the case of Mohamed Ali Sameed Smail v Attorney General Case No. CA

/160/2015, S. Thurairaja PCJ has held that if in law the word shall is used it means

that it must be complied with and there is no discretion available to the person

who is complying with the said law.

As per T.M. Prakash v The District Collector W.P. No. 17608 of 2013, M.P. No. 1

of 2013 on 27 September 2013, the Hon'ble Judge S. Manikumar has held that

when a statute uses the word 'shall', prima facie it is mandatory, but the Court

may ascertain the real intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the

whole scope of the statute.

Moreover, in the case of M/s. Sainik Motors v State of Rajasthan AIR 1961 SC

1480, Hon'ble Mr. Justice Hidayatullah observed that ordinarily though the word

shall is mandatory, it can be interpreted as directory if the context and intention

otherwise demands.

In the case of Lakshmanasami Gounder v C.I.T. Selvamani and others (1992) 1

SCC 91, K Ramasamy J laid down the following statement with regards to the

mandatory nature of word shall in paragraph 5 as; "...It is settled law that the

word 'shall' be construed in the light of the purpose the Act or Rule that seeks to

serve. It is not an invariable rule that even though the word 'shall' be

ordinarily mandatory but in the context or if the intention is, otherwise, it may

be construed to be directory. The construction ultimately depends upon the

provisions itself, keeping in view the intendment of the enactment or of the

Page 5 of 7

context in which the word 'shall' has been used and the mischief it seeks to avoid.

Where the consequence of failure to comply with any requirement of a provision

is provided by the statute itself, the consequence has to be determined with

reference to the nature of the provision, the purpose of enactment and the effect

of non-compliance thereof. In its absence the consequence has to be determined

with reference to the effect of the non-compliance of the provision of the

legislature. Mere use of the word 'shall' need not be given that connotation in

each and every case that the provision would be invariably interpreted to

be mandatory or directory."

In the case of M.N. Gopalakrishna Panicker v State of Kerala (1991] 1 KLJ 75;

[1990] 2 KLT 495, the Counsel, on behalf of the petitioner, referred to a decision

to show that the word "shall" in the rule should be interpreted as mandatory.

Furthermore, in Lexecon, Inc. v Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes and Lerach, 523

U.S. 26, 35 (1998) the Court was of the view that, "The mandatory 'shall' ...

normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion."

According to Black's Law Dictionary 8th Edition at page 1407 the word shall is

defined as: being Has a duty to; more broadly is required to and in Merriam-

Webster Dictionary, the term shall is defined as a term Used in laws,

regulations, or directives to express what is mandatory.

Therefore, the certification by a Gazetted Officer as with regard to the value of

the property is mandatory for the purpose of identification of a public property.

Therefore, it is the opinion of this Court that one has to adopt the Literal Rule in

interpreting the term shall under Section 8(1) of the Act.

In the instant matter the Counsel for the suspect submitted that, the Police have

not filed a certificate as per Section 8(1) of the relevant Act, if that is so the instant

matter has to be considered under the provisions of the Bail Act.

The State Counsel appearing on behalf of the Attorney General further drew the

attention of this Court to the B report which is marked as P6 which reveals the

fact that the Police had not been able to ascertain the value of the production

which is supposed to be lost. The subsequent B reports filed also do not reveal a

Gazetted Officer certifying the value of the property involved.

Therefore, this Court cannot conclude that the instant matter falls within the

provisions of the Offences against Public Property Act No.12 of 1982. As such,

exceptional circumstances are not needed to consider bail but as this is a revision

application which has been filed to set aside the Order of the High Court, it is well

established law that a person filling a revision application must plead exceptional

circumstances which shocks the conscious of Court in the impugned order, in a

revision application.

In the instant matter, the learned High Court Judge had concluded in the order

that there is no certification as to the value of the property involved by a Gazetted

Officer. But he has proceeded to conclude that it is a public property which in the

opinion of this Court is a clear violation of Section 8(1) of the said Act. Therefore,

we see a circumstance which shocks the conscious of this Court in the impugned

order of the High Court Judge.

As such the instant application for revision application is allowed and the suspect

namely Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Manjula Disssanayake is hereby enlarged on

bail on the following conditions,

Page 7 of 7

1) A cash bail of RS.100, 000/=

2) Two sureties to the value of Rs.200, 000/= each

3) The suspect is to report to the relevant Police Station on every last Sunday of

the month

4) The suspect to hand over his passport if any to the registrar of the relevant High

Court

The registrar of this Court is directed to convey the instant order to the relevant

High Court.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
