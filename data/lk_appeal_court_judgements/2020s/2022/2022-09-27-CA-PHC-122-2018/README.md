Judgment

The Petitioner namely Krishnamoorthy Sivakumar had invoked the jurisdiction of the

Magistrates Court of Wattala, in terms of Section 66(1) (b) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 by way of a private plaint and had instituted action

bearing No. 18463/16 against the Respondent namely Fathima Johara Packer. It

Page 3 of 7

appears that the Petitioners complaint to the Magistrates Court was that he is

entitled to the right of way over the portions of land described in 1st and 2nd

schedules referred to in the private information filed by the Petitioner, over which

the Respondent had erected a fence obstructing the said right of way of the

Petitioner. Thus, the Petitioner had prayed for an order declaring that he is entitled

to the right of way over the lands described in 1st and 2nd schedules referred to in

the information affidavit and had sought for an order removing the purported

obstructions and constructions done by the Respondent.

The learned Magistrate, who was acting as the Primary Court Judge, after conclusion

of the inquiry had delivered the Order on 28.02.2017, granting reliefs prayed by the

Petitioner, declaring that the Petitioner is entitled to the right of way over Lot 1B

of plan No.1765 (marked as 5) and Lot 3 of Plan bearing No. 1521 (marked as 4).

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondent had made an application by way

of revision to the Provincial High Court of Colombo seeking to revise or set aside the

said Order of the learned Magistrate made on 28.02.2017. The learned High Court

Judge had affirmed the Order of the learned Magistrate and further ordered the

removal of the parapet wall and gate constructed by the Respondent-Petitioner.

The learned Provincial High Court Judge having carefully analysed the evidence and

material placed by the parties before the learned Magistrate and had come to the

findings inter alia that:

I. The Appellant had constructed a parapet wall leaving a small space of access

for the Respondent.

II. This dispute had arisen when the Appellant purchased a strip of land of 5 feet

attached to the initial road of 5 feet and constructed a parapet wall and a

gate limiting the Respondents access only to the front part of her land.

III. In response to that, the Respondent had erected the said fence.

Being aggrieved by the Order of the Learned High Court Judge dated 01.08.2018,

the Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as Appellant)

preferred an Appeal against the said Order.

It is settled law that exercising revisionary jurisdiction in court is confined to cases

in which exceptional circumstances exist warranting its intervention. Since

exercising revisionary jurisdiction is a discretionary remedy to grant relief, the

Respondent-Petitioner has to establish not only that the impugned order is illegal

but also that the nature of the illegality is such that it shocks the conscience of

court. It appears that the Respondent-Petitioner had not shown any exceptional

circumstances which shock the conscience of court.

It is seen that the Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

Respondent) instituted the instant action in terms of Section 66(1) (b) of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act to obtain a temporary order to have the existing situation

prevail in order to maintain peace between the parties and the status quo as it is.

The learned Magistrate, has stated in his Order that

.

It is imperative to note that the said Order made by the learned Primary Court Judge

is a provisional order. Thus, it is apparent that the rights of the parties have to be

adjudicated by invoking civil jurisdiction of a competent Court.

It appears that the learned High Court Judge too affirmed the Order of the learned

Primary Court Judge. However, the learned High Court Judge acting in revision had

varied part of the Order of the learned Primary Court Judge stating that,

.

In view of the said Orders made by the learned Magistrate as well as the learned

High Court Judge in terms of Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act,

those are Provisional Orders made for the purpose of preserving public peace in a

dispute affecting land pending final adjudication of the rights of the parties in a

competent civil Court.

It is interesting to note that in the case of Punchi Nona Vs. Padumasena and Others

[1994] 2 SLR 117, it was held that the Primary Court exercising special jurisdiction

under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act is not involved in an

investigation into the title or the right to possession, which is the function of a civil

Court. What the Primary Court is required to do is to take a preventive action and

make a provisional order pending final adjudication of rights of the parties in a civil

Court. It is to be observed that Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act has

not granted the legal competency to investigate and ascertain the ownership or title

to the disputed rights which is a function of the District Court.

The intention of the legislature in introducing Part VII of Primary Courts Procedure

Act No.44 of1979 is to prevent breach of the peace and not to embark on a

protracted trial investigating title when deciding the matter in dispute.

Section 74(1) of the said Act, stipulates;

(1) An Order under this part shall not affect or prejudice any right or interest

in any land or part of a land which any person may be able to establish in a

civil suit; and it shall be the duty of a Judge of a Primary Court who

commences to hold an inquiry under this part to explain the effect of these

Sections to the persons concerned in the dispute.

(2) An Appeal shall not lie against any determination or Order under this

part.

Thus, if the Appellant in this application wishes to establish his legal rights to the

disputed portion of land, this is not the forum to adjudicate legal right of parties

relating to the land in dispute.

Although Section 74 (2), does not confer any right of appeal against a decision of the

learned Magistrate, if there is a miscarriage of justice or any injustice caused to a

party, the aggrieved party can invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court.

If a party is aggrieved by the Order of the High Court exercising revisionary

jurisdiction, the aggrieved party is allowed to prefer an Appeal to the Court of

Appeal by operation of law.

However, it is desirable for parties to invoke the civil jurisdiction of a competent

court to establish their rights, rather than preferring an appeal against a provisional

order of the Magistrates Court. It is incumbent upon the Court of Appeal to consider

the legality of the order made by the learned High Court Judge when exercising its

revisionary jurisdiction. Since the Court is not expected to adjudicate the property

rights of parties relating to the land, preferring an appeal against the order of the

High Court would not benefit either party in dispute. Thus it is prudent to invoke

the civil jurisdiction of a competent court to adjudicate their civil rights to the

disputed land.

It is imperative to note that preferring an appeal to the Court of Appeal would not

serve the purpose behind the enactment or the intention of the Legislature in

introducing Part VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act. Thus, it is felicitous for

the party concerned to invoke the civil jurisdiction of a competent court rather than

preferring an appeal to the Court of Appeal.

It is my view that the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 stipulates that

no appeal shall lie against any Determination or Order under this Act to prevent

prolong and protracted hearings and also to prevent frittering away precious time

of courts and parties. When examining the intention of the Legislature in including

the 3 month time frame for a matter to be concluded before the Primary Court

Judge, the implication is such that Legislature intended to discourage people from

filing cases on frivolous grounds, devoid of merit.

Thus, in actual sense the suitable step is to have civil rights of the relevant parties

adjudicated in the relevant competent civil court. Therefore, when filing an appeal

against a provisional order given under the Primary Courts Procedure Act, the party

Page 7 of 7

concerned must come to a degree of certainty that their claim has merit and is likely

to succeed and thereupon decide on the appropriate platform from which he can

receive a fair remedy. It is incumbent upon the learned High Court Judges to direct

parties to a competent civil Court for a final adjudication of their legal rights

pertaining to the land in question. This will enable us to witness an efficient

administration of justice in our Court system.

In this instance, Court draws attention to the petition of appeal filed by the

Appellant. It appears that grounds of appeal are enumerated in paragraph 6 of the

petition. It is significant to note that those grounds have to be adjudicated by a

competent civil court and not in this forum. Furthermore, those grounds of appeal

do not show the Order of the learned High Court Judge as illegal, improper or that

it has caused any miscarriage of justice to the Appellant in proceedings under

Section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

Therefore, I see no reason to interfere with the Order made by the learned

Magistrate made on 28.02.2017 acting as the Primary Court Judge and the Order

made by the Learned High Court Judge on 01.08.2018.

Hence, we dismiss this appeal with cost.

Moreover, it is observable that the Petitioner-Respondent-Petitioner has invoked the

revisionary jurisdiction of this Court against the impugned order. Since this appeal

is dismissed due to the grounds mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs, this Revision

Application bearing No: CA PHC APN 106/2018 too is dismissed with cost.
