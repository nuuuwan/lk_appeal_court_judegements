Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence of him by the

learned High Court judge of Panadura.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Panadura for committing

the murder of his wife Chandi Priyanthika Peiris, on 18th May 2009, an offence

punishable in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code and also attempted

murder of his daughter Chathushi Mendis, by pushing her to the fire that

killed his wife, an offence punishable in terms of section 300 of the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, the appellant was found guilty as charged by the

judgment dated 11-10-2019 and sentenced accordingly.

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant

formulated the following two grounds of appeal for the consideration of the

Court.

(1) The learned High Court judge has failed to properly consider the

evidence led at the trial.

Page 3 of 13

(2) On the basis of the evidence placed before the Court, the learned High

Court judge could not have come to a finding that the charges were

proved beyond reasonable doubt.

The facts as revealed in evidence are briefly as follows.

According to the mother of the deceased (PW-06), the marriage between the

appellant and her daughter was a turbulent one from the very beginning. There

had been a previous divorce action between the parties, which had been

subsequently settled. At the time of the incident, they were living in a rented

house and still they had frequent marital problems. On the day of the incident

the daughter who came to the house of PW-06 informed of her fears to her life.

However, later in the day, she left with the husband and the child to the house

where they live. Because of what she was told, PW-06 also followed them and

had waited with the house owner, who was living adjacent to the rented house

till about 9pm and left as there were no issues. Subsequently, at about 11 pm.

she received the news that her daughter has received burn injuries and had

been taken to the Panadura hospital.

As the injured was asked to be taken to Kalubowila hospital, the mother of the

deceased accompanied by the earlier mentioned landlady of the rented house

(PW-05 named in the indictment) had taken her in a three-wheeler to the

hospital. While being so taken, the injured is said to have made her first dying

declaration to the mother that it was the appellant who poured petrol on her

and set her on fire.

During the cross examination, the mother of the deceased had admitted that

there was an earlier attempt by the deceased to commit suicide due to the

problems she had with the appellant. She has also failed to mention about the

dying deceleration when she made her statement to the Police.

The injured had succumbed to her injuries on the 29th of May 2009. However,

she has made her second dying declaration in writing, while being treated in

the hospital (the document marked P-01) to the woman Police officer (PW-08)

Page 4 of 13

who came to record her statement on the 21st May 2009, stating that it was her

husband who caused the burn injuries to her.

The daughter of the appellant and the deceased (PW-02), who received burn

injuries in the same incident was three years and eight months old at the time.

When she gave evidence in Court, she had been 12 years old. In her evidence

she has given a vivid description as to what happened between her father and

the mother and has also explained how she received her injuries due to her

being thrown into the fire.

PW-08 was the female Police officer who was instrumental in getting the

deceased to make a written dying declaration as she was unable to talk at the

time it was given, and has described how it was recorded. She was the Police

officer who has recorded the statement of the child as well.

The above mentioned are the main witness called by the prosecution in order to

prove the charges against the appellant.

The position of the appellant throughout the trial had been that it was the

deceased who set fire to herself in order to commit suicide, and he was

innocent of murder and the daughter received her injuries during the scuffle he

had in order to defuse the fire.

In making a dock statement when he was called for his defence, it was his

position that due to the constant disputes he and his wife had in their marital

life, she committed suicide and it was not an act of him as alleged. Explaining

the reason for having petrol in his possession, he has explained that since his

motorcycles petrol meter was not working, he kept some extra petrol in the

house so that he would not have any issues in the morning when leaving home

for work.

Grounds of Appeal: -

As pointed out correctly by the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant,

this action has been determined mainly by giving consideration to three main

items of evidence, namely;

Page 5 of 13

(a) Dying declaration made by the deceased to her mother while being

transported to the hospital.

(b) Dying declaration made in writing to the Police who came to the

hospital to record the statement of the deceased.

(c) The evidence of the only eye witness, the child of the deceased and the

appellant, who was three years and eight months old at the time.

It was the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel that the evidence of

the child was not reliable as it was highly improbable for a child of that age to

remember the events that unfolded on that fateful day so vividly as stated by

her in giving evidence some eight years after the incident.

It was his position that the only inference that can be drawn from the way the

child has given evidence describing minute details of the incident is that the

child had been either coached or had stated so due to the influence of the

relatives who are trying to fix the blame on the appellant. He submitted that

the only way to dispel such an inference would have been to call a child

psychologist to establish that the child had the capacity to remember what

happened in such detail, which has not happened in this action and it was

highly unsafe to rely on the childs evidence as reliable under the

circumstances.

The learned Counsel also pointed out to the evidence where the child appears

to have been given the opportunity of reading her statement to the Police before

giving evidence and the close contacts the child had maintained with the

female Police officer who recorded the statement of the child who was also

instrumental in getting a written dying declaration from the deceased, to

further his argument that the evidence of the child cannot be relied on as

trustworthy.

He brought to the notice of the Court the failure of the prosecution to call the

landlady of the house who saw the deceased on fire first, and who was also

present when the deceased was alleged to have made her first dying declaration

to her mother whilst being transported to the hospital, and also of several

Page 6 of 13

important omissions of PW-06 in her evidence in relation to the evidence she

gave before the Magistrate Court and in the Police statement.

It was the submission of the learned Senior State Counsel (SSC) for the

Attorney General that there cannot be any doubt that the deceased had in fact

made the dying declaration in writing while receiving treatment at the hospital.

However, giving consideration to the submissions made with regard to the

reliability of the evidence of PW-02, and the prosecutions failure to call the

relevant material witnesses, she invited the Court to consider the appeal

accordingly.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal: -

As there is evidence of an eye witness apart from the alleged dying declarations

of the deceased, I now proceed to consider whether the evidence of PW-02 was

reliable enough for the learned trial judge to accept her evidence as an accurate

description of what happened between her father and the mother at the time of

the incident.

Before drawing my attention to the reasons given in that regard, I find it

relevant to consider the fact that the learned High Court judge has decided that

it was highly dangerous to act on the evidence of the mother of the deceased

namely, Swarnalatha, (PW-06) on the basis that her evidence was not

trustworthy. It has been determined that the witnesss failure to mention in the

Police statement or at the non-summary inquiry that her daughter told her in

the evening of the incident that the appellant threatened her with death and

wanted her to follow them to the rented house as materially relevant.

Furthermore, the failure of the witness to mention to the Police that her

daughter informed her that it was her husband who set fire to her while being

transported to the hospital also has been considered among other infirmities in

her evidence to disregard her evidence.

The learned High Court judge in his judgment at page 21 (page 390 of the brief)

has correctly concluded that the childs evidence cannot be assessed as that of

an adult, and also the fact that since the child is living with her grandmother

Page 7 of 13

after the incident, her mind may have been contaminated with what is often

discussed about the incident to believe that she actually saw the incident in

that way. He has also drawn his attention to the fact that the child was even

unable to understand the questions asked in Court in some instances at page

22 of the judgment (page 391 of the brief), but has concluded that it has not

caused any effect on the trustworthiness of her evidence.

It has been considered that the child was unable to describe what happened

when she was examined by the doctor one year after the incident. The learned

High Court judge has considered that, if she was unable to describe what

happened one year after the incident, how it was possible for her to give a

Police statement in the manner it has been recorded, since it was the

contention of the defence that it was a concocted story recorded at the

instigation of the Police and the relatives of the deceased. The fact that the

female Police officer who gave evidence at the trial has had a relationship

beyond her official commitments with the deceaseds family and the child has

also attracted the attention of the learned trial judge.

The attention has also been drawn to the observations of the learned

Magistrate before whom the non-summary inquiry was conducted. When the

statement made by the child to Police was read over to her, she has not been in

a position to confirm the statement and the learned Magistrate has decided not

to proceed with the recording of her evidence any further. It has been observed

that there was no use in recording her evidence as she was confused and

unable to relate the facts properly.

However, after considering all the above-mentioned negatives of the evidence of

the child, the learned High Court judge has decided that it was the Magistrate

who has been confused in making the observations, apparently based on the

observations of the learned Magistrate before he commenced the recording of

the evidence proper, that the child appears to be a competent witness because

of the answers given by her to his questioning.

Page 8 of 13

On the basis that the childs failure to describe what happened to her to the

doctor was not a material factor since a child may show reluctance to make a

statement given the environment and since the child has repeatedly stated that

it was the father who set fire to her mother in her evidence to Court, the

learned trial judge has decided that the child was a reliable witness.

Commenting on the childs evidence where it appears that the child has had

the opportunity of reading her Police statement before giving evidence, it has

been the determination of the learned High Court judge that even if it was to

assume that the child had in fact read the statement, it is not possible to

assume that she has the ability to read and understand the contents of the

statement.

The material omissions of the childs evidence where she has failed to mention

to Police that her mother while after been set on fire in the living room, pushed

her under the bedroom bed and her failure to mention that the appellant

poured petrol brought in a Coca Cola bottle on the body of her mother has

been considered as insignificant, given the young age of the witness.

Determining that the child has given her evidence confidently with self-

assurance that it was her father who pushed her into the fire and that she has

rejected the allegation that she is giving evidence on the instigation of the

grandmother in the similar manner, it was the finding of the learned High

Court judge that the defence had failed to create a doubt as to the evidence of

the PW-02, and he has no reason to disbelieve the evidence.

I find that the learned High Court judge was misdirected as to the relevant

facts and the law when he decided that the evidence of PW-02 can be acted

upon and the defence had failed to create any doubt as to the reliability of her

evidence. I am of the view that even if one looks at the analysis of the evidence

of PW-02 by the learned High Court judge in itself, it is abundantly clear that

there was no basis to consider her evidence as reliable.

This becomes more so given the reasons mentioned by the learned trial judge

to disbelieve the evidence of the mother of the deceased. Given the fact that the

Page 9 of 13

child was living with the grandmother and the relatives from the mothers side,

the learned High Court judge should have considered the evidence of the child

who has given a vivid description of what happened more attentively as to

whether it was the truth or a story narrated believing that it was what she saw

in that fateful day.

This may be the very reason why the learned SSC invited this Court to have a

second look at the evidence placed before the trial Court given the

circumstances.

It is my considered view that acting on the evidence of the child as to what

happened was also similarly dangerous, as viewed correctly by the learned

High Court judge when it comes to the evidence of the mother of the deceased.

This leaves only the dying declaration the deceased supposed to have made in

writing, to consider whether it was safe to act on that alone in a matter of this

nature.

E.R.S.R.Coomaraswamy on The Law of Evidence - Vol.01, at page 469

states about the probative value of such evidence in the following manner;

The probative value of dying declarations relevant under section32(1)

would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But there is no

doubt that such evidence suffers from certain intrinsic infirmities. Two of

these defects are the fact that the statement was not made under oath and

the absence of cross-examination of the deponent of the statement.

It has, therefore, been held by our courts that the jury should be told. In

assessing the value of the dying declaration, they should consider these

infirmities and certain other matters peculiar to this type of evidence.

In the case of The King Vs. Asirvadan Nadar 51NLR 322, It was held:

That it was imperative that the jury should have been adequately

cautioned that, when considering the weight to be attached to the

statements contained in the dying declaration, they should appreciate that

the statements of the deponent had not been tested by cross-examination.

Page 10 of 13

Held further; that the attention of the jury should have been specifically

drawn to the question how far the other facts and surrounding

circumstances proved in evidence might be said to support the truth or

otherwise of the deposition.

The case under appeal is a unique situation where the person to whom the

alleged second dying declaration was made had obtained it in writing on the

basis that the person who made it was unable to speak, but could write despite

the burn injuries she had suffered.

The learned trial judge who had considered several infirmities of the evidence of

PW-08 the woman Police officer who was instrumental in getting the written

statement has decided them to be insignificant. It has been established that

the victim was not in a position to open her eyes due to the burns and her

hand was partially burned and could not talk. Under the circumstances, it was

important for the Police officer to at least get a statement recorded from a

person in authority in the hospital ward as proof that the victim was in fact

was in a position to write with all her injuries, which has not happened. The

PW-08 had admitted in her evidence that she failed to enter the required notes

in her notebook as to the condition of the victim when she wrote the dying

declaration.

Although the learned High Court judge had decided that these are matters that

would not affect the case of the prosecution, I am not in a position to agree,

given the considered differences in the evidence of the mother of the deceased

who was supposed to have been present at the time of the declaration in this

regard.

I am of the view that PW-08 was not a cogent witness to act on her evidence

alone as to the dying declaration of the deceased.

It has been an admitted fact that the deceased had, on a previous occasion too,

attempted to commit suicide due to the family disputes the deceased and the

appellant had in their married life. Therefore, given the stand taken by the

appellant that it was his wife who set fire on herself using the petrol he had in

Page 11 of 13

his house for the use of his motorcycle, it was up to the prosecution to

eliminate all the doubts that were in favour of the appellant.

It is true that all the suspicions can naturally direct towards the appellant in

this matter, given the tormented relationship he had with his wife. However, it

is settled law that suspicions do not establish guilt.

It was stated by Basnayake,C.J. in the case of The Queen Vs. Sumanasena 66

NLR 350 that;

In our opinion the learned judges direction was wrong. Suspicious

circumstances do not establish guilt. Nor does the proof of any number of

suspicious circumstances relieve the prosecution of its burden of proving

the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt and compel the

accused to give or call evidence. We are unable to reconcile what the

learned judge said earlier in his summing-up with what he said in the

passage to which exception is taken. The burden of establishing

circumstances which not only establish the accuseds guilt, but are also

inconsistent with his innocence remains on the prosecution throughout the

trial.

In analyzing the defence evidence and the stand taken by the appellant that it

was a suicide, I find that the learned High Court judge has commented that his

wifes previous attempt of suicide should have been proved by the appellant by

calling evidence. This was an admitted fact by the mother of the deceased when

she faced the test of cross-examination, which need no further proof.

I find that the appellant has been found fault with for not calling Kanthi, the

landlady of the house they lived on rent to substantiate his version of events. I

observe this as a shifting the burden of proof to the appellant, which is a

misdirection of law given the circumstances of this action. She has been the

listed witness number 05 in the indictment. Had she been called, she would

have been a key witness for the prosecution, as she was the first person who

Page 12 of 13

was supposed to have reached the scene of the incident and travelled with the

deceased to the hospital.

The only inference that should have been drawn by the prosecution's failure to

call her as a witness was the presumption that can be drawn under the

provisions of section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance, which should have been

held in favour of the appellant and not against him.

The relevant section 114(f) reads as follows;

114(f) that evidence which could be and is not produced would if

produced, be unfavourable to the person who withholds it.

At this juncture, I would like to comment that it was the duty of the

prosecution to assist the Court by placing before it all the relevant evidence in

order to meet out justice, may it be for a victim of a crime or the accused of the

crime for that matter. Had the prosecution called PW-05 Kanthi, who was the

landlady of the rented house where the deceased and the appellant lived, and

the one who reached the deceased first after the incident and also took her to

the Kalubowila hospital in the three-wheeler with the mother of the deceased,

the truth of the evidence could have been determined more accurately. I find

that this failure on the part of the prosecution is a matter that has gone into

the root of this action, which has escaped the attention of the learned trial

judge.

It is trite law that in a criminal trial the accused has to prove nothing, and it is

sufficient for him to give a reasonable explanation as to the evidence against

him and or to create a reasonable doubt of the evidence. An accused person is

entitled to be acquitted of the charges against him in such a situation.

It was held in the case of Pantis Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 148

that;

As the burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove its case

beyond reasonable doubt and no such duty is cast on the accused and its

Page 13 of 13

sufficient for the accused to give an explanation which satisfies the Court

or at least is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.

For the reasons adduced as before, I am of the view that the appellant has

created a reasonable doubt as to his guilt of the charges preferred against him

and it is unsafe to allow the conviction and the sentence to stand.

Therefore, allowing the appeal, I set aside the conviction and the sentence and

acquit the appellant of the charges.

Appeal allowed.
