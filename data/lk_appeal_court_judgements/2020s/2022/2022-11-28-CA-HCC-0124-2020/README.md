This is an appeal by the accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence of him by the

learned High Court Judge of Colombo.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Colombo for three counts

of grave sexual abuse of a minor, committed between the period of 21-11-2013

and 20-11-2014, punishable in terms of section 365B (2) (b) of the Penal Code

as amended by Penal Code (Amendment) Act No- 22 of 1995, 29 of 1998 and

16 of 2006.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge found the appellant guilty as charged

and he was sentenced to 10 years each rigorous imprisonment on each of the

three counts preferred against him, to be served consecutively.

Apart from the above, he was ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 10000/- each on each

of the counts and in default, he was subjected to six months each simple

imprisonment.

The appellant was also ordered to pay the PW-01, who was the alleged victim of

the incident Rs. 200000/- each of the three counts and in default he was

sentenced to a period of two years each rigorous imprisonment on each of the

counts.

Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

(1) Whether the learned High Court Judge has made a serious error in

the consideration of the evidence placed before the Court by referring

to some strange evidence which was never a part of the evidence, and

thereby causing a denial of fair trial for the appellant.

(2) Whether the learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the vital

discrepancy in the evidence as to the first charge preferred against the

appellant.

(3) Whether the learned High Court Judge was in error in his

consideration of the facts and the relevant law in deciding that the

prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.

(4) In any case, whether the sentenced imposed was excessive given the

facts and the circumstances.

Facts in Brief

The facts that led to the indictment against the appellant as revealed in

evidence can be summarized as follows.

The appellant was a neighbour of the victim minor who was the PW-01 in this

case. He was a person who used to visit the house of the appellant frequently.

The alleged three incidents of grave sexual abuse have happened at the house

of the appellant. When the victim came home on the day the alleged sexual

abuses were came to light, the father of the victim has questioned him after

seeing his trouser zip being opened. Upon questioning, the victim has narrated

what was happening to his father.

Based on the statement made to the police by the victim, the appellant had

been indicted for three counts of grave sexual abuse between a period of one

year.

The first count relates to an incident where the appellant was alleged to have

used his penis between the thighs of the victim.

The second count refers to an incident where the appellant was alleged to have

had oral sex on the victim.

The third count refers to the alleged last incident on 20th November 2014 where

the appellant was alleged to have used the penis of the victim between his

thighs.

The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who has examined the victim after the

complaint was lodged has not found any evidence of sexual abuse, but has

opined that the alleged incidents cannot be ruled out, given the nature of the

incidents as narrated to him by the victim.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

Having considered the first ground of appeal, the learned Senior Deputy

Solicitor General (SDSG) on behalf of the respondent conceded that he is in no

position to disagree with the said ground of appeal.

Page 5 of 9

It was his submission that although it was his view that this is a fit case for

sent for a re-trial, he will not be in a position to support even such a course of

action, given the pointed-out deficiencies of the prosecution case.

This Court would like to express our appreciation to the learned SDSG for

expressing his views on this matter with a clear understanding of the duty of a

state prosecutor in assisting the Court to meet the ends of justice.

The 1st ground of appeal: -

In his judgement at page 08 (page 229 of the appeal brief), the learned High

Court Judge refers to the following as the facts of the case.

"

.

.

."

There was no person called Benjimin, even listed as a witness for the

prosecution, leave aside there being any eyewitnesses to the incident. There are

no eyewitnesses to the incident, contrary what has been stated by the learned

High Court Judge in his judgment.

As pointed out by the learned Counsel for the appellant and rightly agreed by

the learned SDSG, this is a serious defect which goes into the root of the

judgment pronounced by the learned High Court Judge. It is my considered

view that this ground of appeal alone would have the effect of vitiating the

conviction and the sentence imposed on the appellant in this matter.

Although the appeal should succeed as mentioned above, I will now proceed to

consider the 2nd and the 3rd grounds of appeal with the view of finding whether

there is a basis to send the matter for a re-trial.

Page 6 of 9

For a matter to be sent for a re-trial, there must be evidence which shows that

the prosecution has a strong prima facie case to be tried for the second time. A

case should not be sent for a re-trial for the prosecution to lead evidence to

cover the deficiencies in the evidence led at the first trial.

In this matter, the sequence of events mentioned in the three counts have been

on the basis that the 1st incident was an incident where the appellant used his

penis between the thighs of the victim as I have stated before. The reason for

mentioning the sequence of events in the three counts mentioned in the

indictment may have been decided on the basis of the statement made to the

police by the victim. However, in giving evidence in Court, the victim describes

the 1st incident faced by him as the appellant placing the victims penis

between the appellants thighs and engaging in sexual abuse. This description

of the incident is in complete contrast to the relevant 1st charge against the

appellant.

In the judgement, the learned High Court Judge in considering the evidence

placed before the Court in relation to the 1st count has reproduced the relevant

questions and answers at page 11 (page 232 of the appeal brief). However,

rather than considering whether this evidence was sufficient to conclude that

the 1st count preferred against the appellant has been proved, the learned High

Court Judge has merely proceeded to convict the appellant on the 1st count

when there was no evidence placed before Court in that regard.

As contended correctly by the learned Counsel for the appellant, the sequence

of events alleged to have taken place becomes very much relevant when

considering the charges preferred against the appellant and the evidence by the

victim in Court.

The 2nd event of sexual abuse that has taken place according to the indictment

was an incident where the appellant alleged to have had oral sex on the victim.

But in giving evidence in Court, the victim has stated that the 2nd incident was

an incident where the appellant had anal sex with him.

Page 7 of 9

The 3rd count relates to the incident where the father of the victim has come to

know about the incident of sexual abuse on 20th November 2014, which should

be considered as the last incident of sexual abuse. In the indictment, the

incident has been referred to as the appellant placing his penis between the

thighs of the victim and engaging in sexual abuse. However, the victim in giving

evidence at the trial has described the last incident as an incident where the

appellant performed oral sex on the victim.

Although one can attribute these discrepancies in the evidence of the victim to

the fact that he may have forgotten the minute details of the incident when he

gave evidence in Court, I find that these are discrepancies that cannot be

ignored on such a basis as the said discrepancies go to the root of the

prosecution case. Therefore, I am in agreement with the submission of the

learned Counsel for the appellant that although it is not necessary to have

corroboration always in sexual offences of this nature, this is a case where

corroboration should be looked into as the evidence of the victim was not

cogent enough to act on itself.

In the case of Sunil and Another Vs. The Attorney General (1986) 1 SLR

230, it was held thus:

It is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of a woman

victim of a sex offence, but if evidence is convincing such evidence could be

acted on even in the absence of corroboration.

Held further: Corroboration is only required or afforded if the witness

requiring corroboration is otherwise credible. If the evidence of the witness

requiring corroboration is not credible such testimony should be rejected

and the accused acquitted.

I am very much mindful that looking for corroboration as a rule in this kind of

sexual abuse matters are not necessary since a perpetrator who engages in

sexual abuse will invariably make sure to maintain the secrecy of his actions.

Page 8 of 9

However, as considered above, when the victims evidence is not cogent

enough, the duty of a Trial Judge is to look for some kind of corroboration in

order to justify a conviction.

It is also necessary to mention that the consistency of a story cannot be

considered as corroboration.

In the case of Sana Vs. Republic of Sri Lanka (2009) 1 SLR 48, it was held:

1. The corroborative facts and evidence must proceed from someone other

than the witness to be corroborated. This means that his previous

statements, even when admissible cannot be used to corroborate him,

as such as proof of a complaint in a sexual case or a previous act of

identification is not corroborative of the evidence of the witness, even

though by showing consistency, it can to some extent strengthen his

credibility.

I find that in the judgement, the learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider the infirmities in the evidence in the correct perspective and come to a

correct finding as to the guilt of the appellant.

As contended rightly by the learned Counsel for the appellant, the learned High

Court Judge, other than stating that the appellant has made a dock statement

and rejecting it on the basis that it has not created any doubt as to the

prosecution case, failed to analyze the dock statement and the defence put

forward by the appellant in any manner which amounts to a denial of a fair

trial towards the appellant.

This is a matter where the incident has occurred in the year 2013 where the

victim was a 14-year-old boy at that time. If the matter is sent for a re-trial, the

victim who will be over 23 years of age by now, would be subjected to the agony

of relating something that had happened to him previously for a second time. I

find that for an adult, this will be an experience he would want to avoid at all

costs. Up to now, the defendant has been in incarceration for more than 2

years and 10 months.

Page 9 of 9

In considering all the above-mentioned infirmities in the evidence of the victim

and the misdirections by the learned High Court Judge in his judgement, I am

of the view that this is not a case where a re-trial should be ordered.

The consideration of the 4th ground of appeal urged by the learned Counsel for

the appellant would not be necessary as the appeal shall succeed on the above-

considered grounds of appeal alone.

Accordingly, I set aside the conviction and the sentence of the accused

appellant and acquit him of the charges preferred against him.

The appeal is allowed.
