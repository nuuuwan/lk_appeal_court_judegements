This is a revision filed by the Attorney General against a sentencing

order delivered by the High Court of Colombo dated 02.04.2019 on

the basis that the sentence imposed on the respondent is manifestly

erroneous.

The respondent was indicted under two Counts in the High Court of

Colombo for having had in his possession and for trafficking of 0.805

grams of heroin and thereby committing an offence under Section

54 A (d) of the amended Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

(Amendment) Act, No. 13 of 1984 (hereinafter the Act). In the event

the quantity of heroin recovered does not exceed 1g, the Act

stipulates a penalty of a fine not less than fifteen thousand rupees

and not exceeding fifty thousand rupees and or imprisonment of

either description for a period not less than three years and not

exceeding seven years. The respondent pleaded guilty, and the High

PHC-APN-CPA-83-19 Page 3 of 4 19/07//2022 IJ-31-22

Court convicted the respondent and proceeded to impose the

following sentence on 02.04.2019:

1. Two years Rigorous Imprisonment suspended for fifteen years.

2. A Fine of Rs. 25,000/- with a term of three years Rigorous

Imprisonment, in default of payment of the fine.

The main submission of the petitioner is that the order of the High

Court is manifestly illegal as the sentence imposed on the

respondent contravenes the minimum mandatory sentence

stipulated under the Act.

The counsel for the respondent stipulated that the High Court has

correctly discharged the petitioner on the charge of trafficking as the

heroin found in his possession was a user quantity as opposed to a

commercial quantity. It was further contended that the High Court

has rightly extracted the principles enunciated on judicial discretion

in sentencing in the Supreme Court cases SC 3/2008 SC Minute

dated 15.10.2008 reported in 2008 BLR in Part II The Bar

Association Law Journal (2008) Vol. XIV and S. C. Appeal No. 89

A/2009 SC Minute dated 12.05.2011 and has rightly applied the

same to the instant facts to impose an appropriate sentence despite

the minimum mandatory sentence envisioned by the legislature.

This Court accepts judicial discretion ought to be used sparingly in

the appropriate instance and that whenever such discretion is

utilised, a judge must record reasons for such an intervention. In

the impugned order, the learned High Court judge has carefully

analysed the circumstances of the quantity of heroin, and the fact

that the quantity did not amount to commercial use. Moreover, the

High Court has observed that he accused ought to be given an

PHC-APN-CPA-83-19 Page 4 of 4 19/07//2022 IJ-31-22

opportunity for rehabilitation and reintegration to society. This

thinking is in line with certain legislative interventions which

especially targeting drug dependent persons /addicted persons.

(Drug Dependent Persons (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Act, No.

54 of 2007).

Therefore, this Court determines that the order of the High Court

dated 02.04.2019 is a well-considered judgment, detailing a careful

analysis of facts and due reasons for its determination. Hence, we

see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned High

Court Judge.

Application dismissed.
