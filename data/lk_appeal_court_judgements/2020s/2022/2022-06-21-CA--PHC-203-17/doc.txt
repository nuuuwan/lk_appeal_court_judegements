This is an appeal filed on 13.11.2017 against the order of the High Court

of Kuliyapitiya dated 02.11.2017 which affirmed an order of confiscation

of vehicle under the Forest Ordinance delivered by the Magistrates Court

of Kuliyapitiya on 15.09.2016.

CA/PHC/203/17 Page 3 of 7 21/06/2022 IJ-29-22

The facts of the case are as follows. The accused-respondent (hereinafter

the accused) was charged in the Magistrate Court of Kuliyapitiya for

transporting timber in a vehicle bearing No. 40 9812 (hereinafter the

vehicle) without a valid license and thereby acting in contravention of the

Forest Ordinance as amended by Act, No. 65 of 2009 (hereinafter the Act).

The vehicle was taken into custody and released to its registered owner,

who is the applicant-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter the appellant), on a

Bond of Rs. 1,500,000/-. The accused pleaded guilty to the charges

levelled against him and the Magistrate convicted the accused on

15.11.2012 and imposed a fine of Rs. 50,000/-. A vehicle inquiry

commenced on 12.12.2013 and the appellant, accused and another

named Fawzi who was a hardware store owner, gave evidence. The

Magistrate delivered his order dated 15.09.2016 and confiscated the

vehicle on the basis that the appellant failed to take necessary precautions

to prevent the commission of a forest offence with the use of his vehicle.

Aggrieved by the said order, the appellant filed a revision application in

the High Court of Kuliyapitiya. The said application was supported both

orally and via written submissions and the High Court delivered its order

on 02.11.2017, dismissing the application. Hence, the appellant has

preferred the instant appeal to the Court of Appeal, seeking to set aside

both the High Court order dated 15.09.2016 and Magistrate Court order

dated 02.11.2017.

Prior to embarking on an analysis of the merits, it is pertinent to quote the

law applicable to the instant application. In this regard Section 40 of the

Act is reproduced below:

(1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence

(a) all timber or forest produce which is not the property of the State

in respect of which such offence has been committed; and

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in

committing such offence, shall in addition to any other punishment

CA/PHC/203/17 Page 4 of 7 21/06/2022 IJ-29-22

specified for such offence, be confiscated by Order of the convicting

Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence, is

a third party, no Order of Confiscation shall be made if such owner

proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements,

cattle and machines, as the case may be, for the commission of the

offence. (Emphasis added)

As decided by a series of judgments in interpreting the proviso to Section

40 (1) of the Act as amended by Act, No. 65 of 2009, the matter of

confiscation of a vehicle under the Act pivots on the issue of whether the

claimant, professing to be an innocent third party, has dispensed the

burden of proving on a balance of probability that he took all precautions

to prevent the use of his vehicle for the commission of a forest offence

under the Act. (See Rajapakshe Pedige Sugath Wimalasuriya v Officer

in Charge, Police Station Pindeniya CA/ PHC / APN /139/19 CA Minute

dated 09.11.2021)

The appellants version is that he is the registered owner of the vehicle who

had employed the accused as a driver to use the vehicle for hires. He stated

that the ordinary course of business is that he receives requests for hires

and that he directs the accused to carry out such request. He stated that

he advised the accused not to engage in illegal activities whilst driving the

vehicle and stated that he is in the habit of regularly checking whether the

accused does otherwise. The appellant stated that on the day in question,

he received a request for a hire from a nearby hardware (owned by Fawzi)

to transport some building material to a location not far. The appellant

gave evidence stating that he expected the vehicle to return within 45

minutes and since there was a delay of over 1 hour and 30 minutes, he

took the initiative to call the accused and inquire about his whereabouts.

It is at that point he has been informed that the accused along with the

CA/PHC/203/17 Page 5 of 7 21/06/2022 IJ-29-22

vehicle has been taken into custody for illegally transporting timber. The

appellant has immediately dismissed the accused who was his employee

for over a year. Appellant insisted that he never gave instructions to

transport timber and that neither the accused nor the hardware owner

Fawzi informed him about the said timber when the latter placed the

request for a hire. (Vide pages 109 110

of the Brief). In their evidence, both the accused and Fawzi states that

they did not inform the appellant regarding the timber. (Vide pages 117

and 124 of the Brief respectively). Having set out the material facts

pertinent to the case, this Court will now examine the applicable law.

Rajapakshe Pedige (supra) concerned an instance where the claimant

failed to adduce any evidence to corroborate the evidence that he

dispensed his burden under the proviso to Section 40 (1) of the Act and as

such the Court of Appeal affirmed the confiscation of the claimants

vehicle. In Imiya Mudiyanselage Aruna Chandana v Officer in Charge,

Police Station Giriulla CA/PHC/24/17 CA Minute dated 03.03.2022,

this Bench affirmed a confiscation of a vehicle under the Act where the

petitioner merely narrated the events precedent to the commission of the

forest offence without attempting to convince the Court of the measures

he had taken as a responsible person in ownership of a vehicle. In both

these cases, the claimants have not carried themselves as reasonable men

in dispensing the burden stipulated by the legislature. In Samarasinghege

Dharmasena v W. P. Wanigasinghe CA(PHC) 197/2013 CA Minute dated

22.01.2019, the Court of Appeal observed that . it is amply clear that

simply giving instructions to the driver is insufficient to discharge the burden

cast on a vehicle owner. Therefore, merely giving instructions alone will not

fall under the possible preventive measures ought to be taken by a vehicle

owner. Similarly, in S. D. N. Premasiri v Officer in Charge,

Mawathagama C A (PHC) 46/2015 Court of Appeal Minute dated

27.11.2018, the Court held it is imperative to prove to the satisfaction of

Court that the vehicle owner in question has not only given instructions but

also has taken every possible step to implement them. An extrapolation of

CA/PHC/203/17 Page 6 of 7 21/06/2022 IJ-29-22

all these cases reveal that Courts are unlikely to be satisfied under the

proviso to Section 40(1) of the Act if the claimant has conducted

themselves unreasonably, both prior to the commission of the forest

offence under the Act and before the Court, dispensing their legislative

burden.

In the instant appeal, witnesses have corroborated the appellants

submission that he was unaware that his vehicle was being used to

transport timber, a fact that is uncontested. The accused, who gave

evidence during the inquiry, has no previous convictions of similar

offences apart from the instant incident, and has been employed by the

appellant for a considerable time period. Under such conditions, the

appellant has been vigilant of the time the accused took to complete his

assigned task. He has made immediate inquiries when the accused failed

to return with the vehicle within the expected time period, and upon being

notified about the forest offence, has immediately expelled the accused

from employment. The Magistrate order dated 15.09.2016 has pronounced

that the appellant ought to have physically visited the accused without

merely making an inquiry over the phone. It is the considered view of this

Court that such a construction is unreasonable. A vehicle owner

employing a driver to carry out transportation of goods cannot reasonably

be expected to physically visit each and every site to ensure that illegal

activities are not carried out using his vehicle. The appellant has given

instructions to the accused and has followed up with due diligence on the

completion of the task. A discrepancy on the number of wood planks inside

the vehicle has prompted the trial judge and the judge sitting in revision

to reject the position of the appellant, which in the opinion of this Court is

not the primary burden envisaged by the legislature under Section 40 of

the Act. It is pertinent to echo the annotations made by His Lordship

Justice Salam P/CA in the case of Jaleel Vs OIC Anti Vice Unit Police

Station Anuradhapura, CA PHC-108/2010 CA Minute 26.08 2014, It has

to be borne in mind that an order of confiscation of property whether

movable or immovable leads to deprivation of property rights of a citizen.

CA/PHC/203/17 Page 7 of 7 21/06/2022 IJ-29-22

Inasmuch as the court has to approach the issue relating to the liberty of the

subject by giving a strict interpretation of the law and the same approach

has to be aimed at resolving the issues relating to the legality of the

confiscation orders as well..

On the other hand, the role of the judge in applying the law related to the

confiscation of property under the Act is to ensure that legislative intention

is not undermined, which in its essence sought stringent legal measures

to safeguard forests and the environment at large, whilst safeguarding

individual rights.

Based on the above reasoning, it is the considered view of this Court that

the appellant has conducted himself as a reasonable man in satisfying this

Court that he had taken all precautionary measures to prevent the use of

his vehicle for the commission of an offence under the Act. Order dated

02.11.2017 of High Court of Kuliyapitiya dated 02.11.2017 and order

dated 15.09.2016 of Magistrates Court of Kuliyapitiya on 15.09.2016 are

hereby set aside and this Court orders the vehicle be released to the

appellant and the bond be discharged.

Appeal allowed.
