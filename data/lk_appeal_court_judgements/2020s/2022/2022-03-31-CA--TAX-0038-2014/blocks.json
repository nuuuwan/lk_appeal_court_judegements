Even otherwise, the definition of an expression contained in one enactment cannot furnish any safe guideline for determining the scope and contents of the same expression used in different context in a separate enactment. () Where a definition is given in an Act, it should be confined as a general rule to interpret the word defined for that Act only and not explain the meaning of the word in another statute, particularly when the two statutes are not in pari materia. The definition given in a statute is for effectuating the provisions of that statute and not for effectuating the provisions of another statute. A definition given in an Act cannot be used for purposes of another Act. The material language of the section has to be always borne in mind, for if a court is prone to indulge in exposition and attempted definition, it will be substituting the language chosen by Parliament with some other form of words and in an attempt at wide survey, some essential factor will be omitted or some inessential factor be substituted or added.",

However, I am unable to agree with the learned Counsel since a ship could not stay at sea forever without reaching a port to take on supplies such as fuel etc. The learned Counsel for the Appellant advanced an argument that the Appellants possessing of a licence issued under Section 5B of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act itself establishes the fact that the Appellant is an exporter of petroleum products sold to ships. However, along with the word export, the words sell, supply and distribute are also present in that Section as alternatives. Therefore, the licence issued to the Appellant cannot conclusively be considered to be a licence that permits export. Hence, I am of the view that unless the Appellant establishes on other evidence that the Appellant exports bunker fuel on that particular licence, the existence of the licence itself is insufficient to establish the said fact.",

On the contrary, if the goods put on board a ship bound for a foreign country but, for some reason dumped in the sea, they can still be said to have been exported, even though they do not reach their destination. Therefore, it appears that in both the instances, though goods have been taken out of the territory, the first example does not constitute an export whereas the second example does.",

If the same ship returns to a Sri Lankan port due to some unforeseen or catastrophic event, the supply could still be treated as an export, but not otherwise.",

In fact, the Respondent has raised this issue in their written submission filed in this Court by stating that the contracts entered into by the Appellant do not provide for a terminus outside the territorial waters of Sri Lanka17. The ship/vessel being a non-resident ship/vessel should not be the test in determining this fact, since, there may be non-resident ships, registered in a foreign country, providing services within the Sri Lankan territory. However, it is unfortunate that in the case in hand, none of these documents were produced. It appears that even the Respondent, the CGIR, has not taken any step under Section 215 of the Inland Revenue Act to search for these documents. Nevertheless, since the Appellant is claiming a tax exemption in this case, the burden lies on the Appellant to establish its eligibility for the exemption.",

Therefore, it was submitted that the Appellants sale of marine bunker fuel, a transaction in foreign currency, constitutes an export. However, in my view this may be one of several criteria which could be taken into consideration in deciding whether a transaction is an export or not but, not the decisive factor. There may be many more local transactions done in foreign currency which would not constitute an export.",
