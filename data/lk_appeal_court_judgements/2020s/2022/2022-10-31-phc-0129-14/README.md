This is an appeal filed against the judgment of the learned High

Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Polonnaruwa dated

28.04.2014 bearing Case No. HCRA 11/2013, which dismissed the

revision application filed against the order of the learned Magistrate

of the Magistrates Court of Polonnaruwa in Case No. 91913 (AR

135/2012). The petitioner has invoked the appellate jurisdiction of

this Court to set aside both orders and thereby to dismiss the

CA-PHC- 129-14 Page 6 of 10 31/10/2022 IJ- 45-22

matter in limine as the matter in question is a preliminary objection

based on prescription.

The facts of the case are as follows. The 1st Defendant-Petitioner-

Appellant Company published the impugned advertisement in

question in Lankadeepa newspaper on 14.11.2011 indicating that

MD Diabetic Jam is suitable for diabetic patients. On 09.02.2012

Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

Respondent) who is a Public Health Officer informed in writing to

the learned Magistrate of Polonnaruwa regarding the violation of

Regulation 13(9)(ii) of Food (Labelling and Advertising) Regulations

of 2005 by the said advertisement. The charge sheet for the matter

was filed on 28.06.2012.

The contention under scrutiny of this Court is whether this action

is prescribed under section 20(1)(b) of the Food Act, No. 26 of 1980

as amended by the Food (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 1991

(hereinafter referred to as the Food Act).

Section 20 (1) on the Institution of Proceedings in the Food Act

states that;

(1) A prosecution for an offence under this Act or any

regulations made thereunder shall not be instituted-

(a) except by an Authorized Officer; and

(b) after the expiration of three months, from the date of

detection of that offence or where sampling is done,

from the date of sampling.

Hence, it must be deliberated whether the written report sent by the

Respondent to the learned Magistrate amounts to an institution of

proceedings, and if it was duly sent before the time bar imposed by

the Food Act. To understand what constitutes an institution of

CA-PHC- 129-14 Page 7 of 10 31/10/2022 IJ- 45-22

proceedings, we must draw our attention to the section 136 (1)(b)

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 (hereinafter

the CPC).

(1) Proceedings in a Magistrates Court shall be

instituted in one of the following ways:

(a)

(b) on a written report to the like effect being made to a

Magistrate of such court by an inquirer appointed under

Chapter XI or by a peace officer or a public servant or a

servant of a Municipal Council or of an Urban Council

or of a Town Council;

At this instance, reference should be made to Tunnaya alias

Gunapala v. Officer-in-Charge, Police Station, Galewela [(1993)

1 Sri L.R. 61 where Bandaranayke J. stated,

When proceedings are instituted under Chapter XIV on the other

hand the Magistrate takes cognizance of the accusation contained in

the Police report or in a written complaint or upon the taking of

evidence as the case may be in terms of s. 136(1). Section 136(1) is

read with the provisions of s. 135 when appropriate. It is to be noted

at this stage that the language of all the clauses in s. 136(1)

contemplates a person accused of an offence and not a mere

suspect.

Therefore, it can be distilled from the above case that, instituting

proceedings under section 136(1)(b) of the CPC entails three

requisites;

(i) Proceedings being instituted by an authorized officer

indicated in the section,

(ii) Specific material or the accusation to form the charge, and

CA-PHC- 129-14 Page 8 of 10 31/10/2022 IJ- 45-22

(iii) Naming the accused

When perusing the written report sent to the learned Magistrate by

the respondent - who is a Public Health Officer and thereby a public

servant, it is evident that it explicitly identifies the 1st Defendant-

Petitioner-Appellant Company as the producers and distributors of

the item advertised by the impugned advertisement and the specific

material to form the charge. Further, a request made to the

Company Registrar was pending in order to obtain the details of the

Board of Directors of the company. Under section 27 of the Food

Act, it is a requisite under the provision to name the directors,

general managers, secretaries or such similar officers as parties to

the action if the offense is committed by a body corporate.

27. Where an offence under this Act or any

regulations made thereunder is committed by a

body of persons then-

(a) if that body of persons is a body corporate,

every person who at the time of commission of

the offence was a director, general manager,

secretary or other similar officer of that body;

It is clear that, under Section 136(1)(b) of the CPC, institution of

proceedings in a Magistrate Court (in addition to certain other

modes) takes place upon the presentation of a written report

complaining of the commission of an offence. Once a report is filed

under Section 136(1)(b) of the CPC, the next step is to ascertain

under Section 182 of the CPC as to whether there is a sufficient

ground for proceeding against the accused. In the event of the

opinion being favorable to the prosecution, the Magistrate shall

frame a charge against the accused. Magistrates usually do not

frame charges themselves in each and every case but accepts the

CA-PHC- 129-14 Page 9 of 10 31/10/2022 IJ- 45-22

draft charge which is tendered by the prosecuting party. Yet in law,

it is the charge framed by the Magistrate from the moment it is

accepted. (See CA-PHC-108/2010- CA minutes dated 26.08.2014).

Therefore, this Court determines that the written report sent by the

respondent on 09.02.2012 unequivocally falls in line with

institution of proceedings under the section 136(1)(b) of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act read with sections 20 and 27 of the Food

Act.

Furthermore, this Court would like to distinguish the case at hand

from the case CA (PHC) 292/2006 CA minutes dated 26.07.2019

relied upon by the counsel for the Appellant. In the latter case K.K.

Wickramasinghe J. states that;

I observe that as per section 20(I)(b) of the Food Act as amended by

Act No. 20 of 1991, a prosecution for an offence under the Act shall

not be instituted "after the expiration of three (3) months from the date

of detection of that offence or where sampling is done, from the date

of sampling". In the instant case, the complaint was filed on

07.01.2005, nearly after one and a half years of detection of offence.

In the said complaint, it was mentioned that the complaint has been

filed in terms of section 136(I)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act. Both the Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge

was of the view that failure to raise the said preliminary objection as

early as possible should be considered as a waiver on the part of the

appellant.

However, in the above-mentioned case, the Public Health Inspector

produced the impugned product - a Ginger beer bottle found with a

bent straw inside, to the Magistrate within the time bar and

thereafter the Magistrate called for a Government Analysts report.

The case was such that it required the involvement of a Government

CA-PHC- 129-14 Page 10 of 10 31/10/2022 IJ- 45-22

Analyst and this particular report which amounted to the

institution of proceedings under section 136(1)(b) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act, was submitted to the Magistrate after the

expiration of three months. On the contrary, in the case at hand, as

observed above, the written report sent to the learned Magistrate of

Polonnaruwa by the respondent Public Health Officer indubitably

amounts to an institution of proceedings and it has been duly sent

within the three months period.

Therefore, this Court finds no reason to interfere with the decisions

of the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge.

Appeal dismissed.
