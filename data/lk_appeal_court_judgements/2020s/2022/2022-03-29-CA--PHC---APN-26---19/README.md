Decided on: 29.03.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed by the accused petitioners

(hereinafter referred to as petitioners) to set aside the judgment dated

29.11.2018 of the High Court.

At the very outset the Counsel appearing for the petitioners stated that he is

not canvassing the conviction and the judgment but is only canvassing the

sentence, as such submissions were limited to the same.

Page 4 of 6

The petitioners in the High Court had been the 1st 7th 9th and the 10th accused in

a case of 12 accused in which all had been indicted for murder and for unlawful

assembly to commit murder.

The petitioners had pleaded not guilty to the indictment and trial had

commenced and upon conclusion of the same the accused had been found guilty

for the 1st and the second charges in the indictment and the petitioners had been

sentenced to

1) For the 1st count 6 months RI and Rs 5000 fine and in default 3 months

imprisonment, 2) 2nd count 10 years RI and Rs 10000 fine in default 6 months imprisonment

with compensation.

Being aggrieved by the said sentence the instant application has been filed.

The contention of the Counsel for the petitioners is that,

1) The incident had taken place without premeditation,

2) The incident is without motive

3) The incident is after an act of consuming liquor.

According to the facts of the case on the date of offence the deceased with

witness nu 1 and 2 had gone to the boutique around 5 30 in the evening and had

consumed 1 and half bottles of arrack and the 7th and the 11 petitioners had

gone by on a motor cycle and the deceased had wanted them to bring a packet of

cigarettes, but the petitioners had not obliged and the deceased had been

irritated. Thereafter the deceased with the witnesses had gone to the boutique

to purchase the cigarettes and afterwards they had stopped to chat to a friend

when the 1st and the 12 accused had passed by and the deceased had restarted

the argument and there had been an exchange of fisticuffs, which had later

developed to a brawl in which the deceased has sustained the fatal injury along

with six other injuries.

According to the evidence the 1st accused had stabbed the deceased and the 7th

and the 9th accused had come to the scene with clubs.

The deceased had sustained 7 injuries and the 3rd had been the fatal blow which

had been caused to the chest and which had been classified as being necessarily

fatal by the doctor, the others had been contusions and abrasions.

The Counsel appearing for the petitioners cited the case of Kumara vs. Attorney

General 2003 1 SLR 139 where reduction of sentence has been considered.

The state counsel stated that the deceased had been isolated and assaulted by

the accused, and furthermore he was assaulted and stabbed while being fallen.

The state Counsel also submitted that the petitioners had come by way of

revision when the right of appeal has been available and no reasons had been

given.

Upon perusal of the petition of appeal this Court observes that the petitioners

have given reasons for not filing an appeal although common it might be the

reasons stated. But as the petitioners are not canvassing the conviction but only

the sentence this Court would except those reasons to be exceptional and also

since there is no obvious delay in filling the revision application.

In view of the submissions made by both parties this Court observes that the

whole incident has commenced on the instigation of the deceased which both

parties agree to, and in the said brawl the stabbing of the deceased had taken

place.

The legality of the conclusion of the High Court Judge and the reasons given for it

this Court would not go in to as only the sentence is being challenged at this

point.

The High Court Judge had sentenced the petitioners for 10 years RI on the basis

of knowledge which is the maximum sentence which the statute has specified,

but in view of the fact that the deceased was the main contributory factor to the

incident this Court thinks it is only fair to vary the sentence with regard to the

second charge and reduce it to 5years RI and the rest of the sentence with regard

to the 1st and the 2nd charge remains along with the compensation.

Subject to the above variation the instant application for revision is dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree
