R. Gurusinghe, J.

The Accused Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Colombo for being in

possession and trafficking of 8.64 grams of Heroin, an offence punishable

under section 54 A of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, as

amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

After trial, the learned Trial Judge convicted the appellant for both charges and

imposed life imprisonment upon him.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant

appealed to this Court.

The grounds of appeal relied on by the appellant are as follows:

3

1. The conviction is wholly unsafe in view of the un-corroborated and

unsatisfactory nature of the evidence of the main witness PW1, led by the

prosecution.

2. The learned Trial Judge failed to consider the rules governing the test of

probability to the prosecution version.

3. The prosecution failed to establish the chain as to the passage of

production from the police station to the government analyst.

4. The learned Trial Judge has considered only the prosecution evidence

and failed seriously to evaluate the evidence given by the defence.

5. The learned Trial Judge erred in law by rejecting the dock statement

made by the appellant with reversing the burden of proof.

6. The learned Trial Judge has misdirected himself and thereby erred in law

and the facts of the case, causing grave prejudice to the appellant.

The prosecution version

PW2 received information from an informant on the 29th of February 2012 at

3.55 p.m., that a person known as Bambara would come to the Maligawatte

filling station with heroin. If the police could come immediately, the informant

said that he could show the suspect to the police. PW1 Sub Inspector -

Samantha arranged a raid which consisted of 8 police officers, including PW1,

PW2 Police Constable Ratnasiri, and a Woman Police Constable (WPC). The

police team proceeded to the roundabout on Sangaraja Mawatha at about 4.55

p.m., precisely one hour after receiving the information. All of them were in

civil clothes. They stopped their vehicle on the left side of the road, near the

filling station. Then PW2 left the vehicle and proceeded to meet the so-called

informant.

4

After meeting the informant, PW2 came back to the vehicle. Then PW1, together

with PW2, left the vehicle while the other police officers remained in the vehicle.

PW1 and PW2 crossed the road and went towards Maligawatte. The informant

went ahead of PW2. They went about 150 meters and came to a bus stop near

the Maligawatte filling station where PW1, PW2 and the informant waited for

the appellant for about five minutes. Within that five minutes time, the

appellant appeared from the direction of the roundabout wearing a blue trouser

and a red t-shirt. The informant then showed them the appellant (Bambara)

and said that he was sure that the appellant had heroin in his possession at

that time. When the appellant came towards PW1 and PW2 they clutched the

appellants hands. On searching him, they had found a parcel containing 41.6

grams of substance in his right-hand side trouser pocket, which on subsequent

analysis by the Government Analyst, had revealed the presence of 8.64 grams

of heroin.

The version of the defence is that the appellant is a three-wheeler driver. When

he was waiting for hires, a person who came in the guise of a passenger

wanting to take a hire, led the way to the appellants house. He was assaulted

by a team of police officers who were in civil clothes and asked for a person

called Kanna. The appellant was wearing shorts at that time. He was asked

to change the shorts and wear trousers which he did. The three-wheeler was

handed over to his mother.

The prosecution has called only PW1 to prove the raid. PW2, who allegedly

received the information, was not called to give evidence. A good deal of

hearsay evidence was led regarding the information received and the

communication between the so-called informant.

Though the informant wanted the police to come immediately, the police team

went to the alleged place of detection precisely an hour later. However, the

position of PW 1 is that, within 5 minutes from their arrival at the bus stop

near the Maligawatta filling station, the appellant had emerged from the

5

direction of the roundabout and had come towards them. The appellant was

wearing a red T-shirt and blue trousers, which can be regarded as easily

recognizable colours. Everything had happened the way the police wished.

Even though they had reached there an hour later, the appellant had come in

five minutes without keeping them waiting so long. The police vehicle stopped

at the first filling station at 4.55 pm. They arrested the appellant at 5.10 pm. It

took only 15 minutes for them to execute everything, including the meeting of

the informant at the first filling station, walking with the informant to the next

filling station, waiting for the appellant at the bus stand and arresting the

suspect. However, PW1 had not spoken a single word with the informant on

these occasions. It is very doubtful that a prudent, reasonable man would

believe this as a probable story.

As per the evidence of the appellants sister, the appellant was a three-wheeler

driver. A group of people assaulted him while inquiring about another person.

They had searched the entire house and asked him to change his shorts and

wear a trouser. The keys to the three-wheeler was given to his mother and

they took her brother with them. She also stated that her brother had returned

only after two years.

The learned High Court Judge has rejected the evidence of the defence on the

basis that the position of the defence was not put to PW1. However, this

observation of the learned High Court Judge is factually incorrect. The

following questions were put to PW1 by the defence counsel.

The position of the defence was completely put to the witness. Therefore, the

observation by the learned Trial Judge that the defence version was not put to

PW1 was incorrect. The only thing that was not put to PW1 was the fact that

7

the appellant was assaulted, which, however, does not affect the credibility of

the defence.

The evidence of the appellants sister is that the police had brought the

appellant to his house, asked him to remove the shorts and wear trousers,

handed over the keys of the three-wheeler to his mother, and the police

searched the entire house, standing un-contradicted and un-challenged. The

prosecution has not challenged the above facts by cross-examining the

appellants sister and has not even suggested that her evidence was not true.

Other than the heroin, among the things that the police had recovered from the

appellant were his driving licence, Rs. 2048/-, his national identity card, his

mobile phone with the sim and a white colour wallet. All these items are

compatible with the position that the appellant was waiting to receive hires in

his three-wheeler. The fact that the three-wheeler was handed over to his

mother, was not challenged at all by the prosecution. PW1 never referred to a

three-wheeler in his evidence. The undisputed evidence of the defence proved

the following facts:

1. After arresting the appellant, he was taken to his house (the place of

arrest was in dispute).

2. The police searched the house of the appellant.

3. They have found nothing illegal in the house of the appellant.

4. The three-wheeler was handed over to the mother of the appellant.

This also proves the fact that he was arrested with the three-wheeler.

5. The appellant was ordered to change his shorts and wear trousers.

Though the dock statement is not subjected to cross-examination and is made

without an oath, the dock statement of the appellant was completely

8

corroborated by the evidence, sworn by his sister. From the defence evidence,

it is clear that the story of PW1 did not happen the way he described it.

In the Supreme Court appeal 154/10, decided on 03.01.2019 Attorney General

vs Devinduruge Nihal case, the Supreme Court held that an accused can be

convicted on a single witness in prosecution, based on the police detection, if

the Judge forms the view that the evidence of such witness can be cautioned

and be relied upon after probing the testimony.

It is settled in law that the evidence of an official witness is not to be

disbelieved or discarded merely because they are official witnesses.

However, before basing conviction on the evidence of a police officer, strict

scrutiny with care and caution is required. If the evidence of a police witness is

found compelling, reliable and credible, the conviction can be based on such

evidence.

However, in this case, the evidence of PW1 is not so convincing and not

corroborated by calling any other officer who participated in the detection. On

the other hand, the dock statement of the appellant was corroborated by the

evidence of his sister. Therefore, the defence evidence stands un-challenged.

In the case of Hettiarachige Amila Pathum vs Attorney General CA 204/2008

decided on 27.02.2013, Sisira de Abrew J. held, quoting the case of the Queen

vs Kularatne 71 NLR 529, that;

(1) If the dock statement is believed, it must be acted upon.

(2) If the dock statement raised a reasonable doubt in their minds about the

prosecution case, the defence must succeed.

(3) Dock statement, one accused should not be used against the other

accused.

9

The learned High Court Judge has brushed aside the whole defence evidence

on the footing that the position was not put to PW 1. However, I have pointed

out that the position of the defence was put to PW1. The learned High Court

Judge has not evaluated the defence evidence by applying the test of

probability with due care. Furthermore, almost all the evidence of the defence

stands unchallenged by the prosecution. Thus, the learned High Court Judge

erred in rejecting the defence evidence.

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that it is not safe to allow the

conviction of the appellant to stand.

Therefore, the conviction is set aside, and the appellant is acquitted of the

charges.

The appeal is allowed.
