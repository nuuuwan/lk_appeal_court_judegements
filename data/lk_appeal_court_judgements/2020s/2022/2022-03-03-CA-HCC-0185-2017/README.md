The fifth accused-appellant (the appellant) was indicted in the high court of

Gampaha along with five others. The charges were as follows:

1) On or about 23rdApril 1994, within the jurisdiction of this court were

members of an unlawful assembly of which the common object was to

3

commit hurt and murder of Mohamad Usman Mohomad Housun and

thereby committed an offence punishable under section 140 of the penal

code;

2) that at the same time and place in the course of the same transaction

that one or more of the members of the unlawful assembly caused the

death of Mohamad Usman Mohomad Housun and thereby committed the

offence of murder punishable under section 296 of the penal code read

with section 146;

3) that at the same time, place and the same transaction that you did cause

the death of Mohammed Usman Mohamed Housun and thereby

committed the offence of murder punishable under section 296 of the

penal code.

The third and sixth accused died during the pendency of the trial.

The prosecution led the evidence of PW1, PW3,PW2, PW4, PW10, PW7, PW8,

PW6, PW22, PW9 and the court interpreter (Muraliyar) of the court.

PW1 and PW3 claim to be eyewitnesses. PW4 is the Judicial Medical Officer.

After trial, The Learned High Court Judge has discharged all the remaining

accused from all charges, except the appellant.

The Learned High Court Judge has relied on the evidence of PW1 and PW3.

Accordingly, as per the evidence of PW1 and PW3, the appellant stabbed the

deceased on the back of his body near the shoulder, which caused the death of

the deceased. The Learned High Court Judge has further pointed out in his

judgment that there was no sufficient evidence to show that the other accused

persons contributed to the death of the deceased beyond reasonable doubt.

The facts of the case are briefly as follows;

4

A mob of people, including the appellant, had taken the deceased out from the

house of PW2. A large number of people, including the appellant had attacked

the deceased. The deceased was then taken near a kottan tree where he was

made to sit on the steps of an old meat shop. PW1, in his evidence, has stated

that he saw the appellant stab the deceased on the shoulder when the

deceased was sitting or lying near the kottan tree. (Page 77 of the brief)

The first and second accused were also present at that time. PW1 states that

he was standing near a bamboo bush about 20 meters away from the place of

the incident when he saw the appellant stabbing the deceased

After witnessing the stabbing, PW1 states that he got into a bus to go to the

police station. According to the evidence of PW1, the bus passed by the place

where the deceased was sitting and PW1 saw the deceased crossing the road

after receiving the stab injury. PW1 has further stated in his evidence that he

was on the bus about 20-30 minutes after the deceased was stabbed and that

the bus did not stop even though the deceased was crossing the road. If the

evidence of PW1 is to be believed, then the injury caused by the appellant

cannot be fatal. (on pages 104 and 105) he said as follows:

(On pages 116 and 117), PW1 further stated in the re-examination as follows:

When this piece of evidence is compared with the evidence of the Judicial

Medical Officer (the JMO), it is clear that the deceased was not in a position to

walk after receiving the fatal injury. (On page 202), the doctor stated as

follows:

Thus, the evidence of PW1 and the evidence of the JMO are contradictory. The

deceased was not in any position to stand up or walk to the other side of the

road after receiving the stab injury.

8

This injury 'D' is alleged to have been committed by the appellant as per the

evidence of PW1 and PW3. The JMO states that injury 'D' is not necessarily a

fatal injury. According to the JMO's evidence, the necessarily fatal injury was

named as 'A.' The injury named as 'D' is described as a grievous injury and not

necessarily a fatal injury.

There is no evidence as to who inflicted the injury named 'A.' PW1 states that

he saw the deceased crossing the road about fifteen to thirty minutes after the

appellant inflicted a stab injury on the shoulder of the deceased.

The Learned High Court Judge relied on the evidence of PW1. If the evidence of

PW1 is believed, the deceased was able to walk even thirty minutes after

receiving the stab injury. PW1 had not seen what happened to the deceased

during his absence after that. PW1 and PW3 do not speak of any injury caused

by the appellant on the anterior of the deceased. As per the JMO, after the

deceased received the injury named 'A' on the chest, he would not be able to

walk or even sit.

As per the evidence of PW3, the appellant had stabbed the deceased on the

deceased's shoulder. After that, in two to three minutes, the police arrived. The

police had taken the deceased to the hospital on a stretcher. This evidence

completely contradicts the evidence of PW1.

There were many injuries on the deceased's body; out of these, only four were

identified as grievous injuries, which were named 'A,''B,''C'and 'D' in the post

mortem report produced in evidence as 'P2'. A diagram is also attached to it.

Injuries' A', 'B,' and 'C' were on the anterior, and injury 'D' was on the posterior

of the body of the deceased. Injuries 'B', 'C' and 'D' were grievous injuries. The

injury named 'A' is the only injury described as a necessary fatal injury.

According to the JMO's evidence, the death of the deceased was caused by the

injury named 'A.'

9

Evidence of PW1 and PW3 is not compatible with each other. Either one of

them or both of them are not telling the truth. PW1 is an accused in a case of

murder that happened on the same day of the incident of this case. The

deceased in that case is a relative of the accused in this case. Except for the

second accused, all five other accused are relatives. PW1 is an interested

witness and had a motive to see the appellant and the rest of the accused are

convicted, and as such his evidence should be considered carefully.

It is not clear from the evidence who inflicted the injury named 'A' in the post

mortem report. As per the evidence, there were several people who had

attacked the deceased at several places.

In a situation where several accused had tried together based on common

intention to secure a conviction of one accused out of several accused, the

prosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the convicted

accused who in fact was responsible for the commission of the offence and not

the rest of the accused.

In the case of Karupiah Servai vs.The King 52NLR 227, Dias J held that;

"the situation in which the prosecution found itself may be reduced to the

following prepositions. ( X The person who strangled the deceased ) maybe 'A',

'B', or 'C', in order to secure the conviction of 'A', the prosecution had to

establish beyond reasonable doubt that X is not 'B' or 'C'. It is then and only

then that the guilt of 'A' can be said to have established beyond reasonable

doubt".

PW1 said the first and second accused assaulted the deceased with clubs (on

page 86) and that the (appellant), the fifth accused, stabbed the deceased only

once.

(On Page 97)

According to the evidence of PW1, when the deceased was dragged upto the

kottan tree, the appellant was not there. The appellant came to that place later.

The sixth accused strangled the deceased. However, as per the doctor's

evidence,there were no signs of strangulation on the neck of the deceased.

(Page 114) PW1 reiterated that the appellant stabbed only once.

(On Page 114)

As per the evidence of PW3 Subasinghe, the first accused assaulted the

deceased with tiles. The third and fourth accused attacked the deceased with

clubs.

(Page 124)

The third and fourth accused attacked the deceased with clubs and stones. The

sixth accused stabbed the deceased near the hip (page 128, 129),and the sixth

accused strangled the deceased

(On Page 133, and 134), The appellant stabbed the deceased on the back .

PW 3 (on page 151), referring to the sixth accused, said;

But this claim was not proved by medical evidence. As per the evidence of the

JMO, there was no injury on the hip of the deceased.

(On Page 204) the doctor answered as follows:

:

:

This evidence shows that the evidence of PW3 is not reliable and therefore,

PW3 is not a reliable witness.

PW3 had made a statement to the police on 19th May 1994, after Twenty Six

days of the incident. His explanation was that he did not go to the police

station as the accused were not arrested.

In Haramanis vs.Somalatha [1998] 3 SriLR 365, Jayasuriya J described the Test

of Spontaneity and the Test of Contemporaneity as follows;

"The law in its wisdom requires that the statement should be made within a

reasonable time. The test is whether it was made as early as could reasonably

12

be expected in the circumstances and whether there was or was not time for

tutoring and concoction. It is a question of fact depending on the attendant

circumstances of the case. No hard and fast rule can be laid down as to when a

statement is sufficiently contemporaneous."

This explanation for 26 days delay is not plausible and acceptable.

In Jayawardena and others vs The State [2000] 3Sri LR 192, Hector Yapa J

stated thus;

"It is needless to say that such a long delay without reasonable grounds would

make the evidence of the complainant, who is the only witness to the robbery

suspicious and unsatisfactory having regard to the test of spontaneity and

contemporaneity. It is common knowledge that, when complaints are not made

promptly after an incident, there is always room for false implication motivated

by ill will or on hearsay material. Therefore in our view there is merit in this

argument advanced by learned Counsel that it would be dangerous to act on

the evidence of the complainant in view of the long delay which has not been

satisfactorily explained."

The delay in making a statement by PW3 is not reasonable in the

circumstances of this case. His evidence contradicts the evidence of the

Judicial Medical Officer'.

The learned High Court Judge has relied upon the evidence of PW1 and PW3

(para 38 and 39 of the judgment) to convict the appellant. When considering

the evidence of PW1 and PW3 with the evidence of the JMO, the evidence of

PW1 and PW3 cannot coexist. The Learned High Court Judge described the

injury named as 'A' as an injury caused with the intention of killing the

deceased. However, the judgment is silent about who inflicted the injury 'A'.

13

Even if the evidence of PW1 and PW3 is believed, only conclusion that could be

drawn from that evidence is that the appellant had inflicted the injury named

as 'D', which is not a fatal injury.

The learned Additional Solicitor General for the respondent concedes that there

is no evidence to establish a common intention among the accused. He also

concedes that there was no sufficient evidence to convict the first, second and

fourth accused. The third and sixth accused were deceased during the

pendency of the trial. The learned Additional Solicitor General pointed out that

the acquittal of the rest of the accused is correct.

As described above, the evidence of PW1 and PW3 was not reliable and the

conviction cannot be sustained based onthat evidence. There is no evidence as

to who inflicted the fatal injury to the deceased.

In these circumstances, the charges against the appellant have not been

established beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, the conviction and the

sentence imposed on the appellant is set aside. The appellant is acquitted.

Appeal allowed.
