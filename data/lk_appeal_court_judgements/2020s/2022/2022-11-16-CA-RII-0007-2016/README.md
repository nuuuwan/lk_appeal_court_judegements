D.N. Samarakoon, J.

The main allegation of the 08th defendant petitioner is that whereas there is a

duty cast upon the learned district judge in a partition action, to investigate the

title of the parties, he has not considered that Nicholas Perera, the original owner

transferred undivided 4 acres from the subject matter, which is little more than

17 acres in extent, in favour of her predecessors.

The said transfer, according to the petitioner, has been effected by deed No. 6820

dated 15.07.1876 marked as 8 D.1.

It appears however, that the said deed is, to use the terms used by the petitioner

herself in her written submissions dated 24.05.2022 at paragraph 5, where it is

said, that, if the said deed bearing No. 6820 marked as 8D.1 is not readable and

understandable. The petitioner contends that the learned district judge

should have informed this to the petitioner, who will then be able to call expert

evidence, etc.

The written submissions of the 15B, 16 and 17 defendant respondents dated

31.05.2022, at page 3, states what was the position, if 8D.1 was accepted.

In terms of the statement of claim of the 8th defendant petitioner that

the original owner of this land was namely Josage Nicholas Perera who

under and by virtue of Deed bearing No. 6820 dated 15.07.1876

and..has gifted an undivided 4 acres to aforesaid Josage Nonahamy and

Jayasinghe Arachchige Don Baron Appuhamy. Therefore said Nicholas

Pereras wife namely Katugampalage Manchinona and her children are

entitled to undivided share leaving 4 acres of land.

The said respondents, in written submissions at page 4 reproduces what the

learned district judge has said with regard to deed No. 6820, as reproduced

below,

The document marked as 8.D.1 is partly decayed and it cannot be

deciphered in any way. Furthermore, 8 D.1 does not say as to what is the

land relevant to that document. All the suggestions made with effect to

that such a document has been executed in respect of the subject matter

of the action has been vehemently refused by the plaintiff. If at least the

extracts of the Registration Folios were produced, the Court could have

ascertained as to what land the said document relates. The 8th defendant

who relies upon the said document has not taken any steps to prove that

document. Furthermore, Josage Nonahamy, claimed to have been

obtained rights from 8 D.1 has executed deeds P.07, P.08, 8D.2 and 8D.3,

after the date of 8D.1, but she has not referred to rights obtained from

deed No. 6820 (8D.1).

The said Josage Nonahamy has alienated her maternal inheritance by all

those deeds. Furthermore, the 8th defendant, when she was cross

examined, has stated that she did not have the original of 8D.1 with her,

but she received it from a surveyor called Mr. Wickremasinghe. Therefore,

on matters that has been established with regard to 8 D.1 and its contents

I hold that it has not been proved that the said document pertains to the

land which is the subject matter of this action. Hence, I hold, on a balance

of probability, that the original owner Josage Nicholas Perera died without

alienating any share of the land and his rights were inherited by his wife

and children.

Hence Josage Nonahamy has acted as if 8 D.1 was not executed.

The petitioner has also alleged that there is a discrepancy of the totality of the

shares since it has been given as 136/137.

However, the petitioner has filed an appeal bearing No.

WP/HCCA/AV/1302/2012 in the Civil Appellate Court of Avisswella, which was

dismissed.

It is also submitted that the Registration of Documents has not commenced by

the date of 8D.1 as it started from 1935. However, in 1935 it was Registration of

Cheettu and the Registration of Document Ordinance came into being in 1927.

Hence it appears that there was no registration of 8D.1.

The 4A defendant respondent has also stated in written submissions dated

November 2018 at page 9 that the appeal bearing No. WP/HCCA/Av/1302/2012

was dismissed because the respective counsel for the present petitioner informed

that he has no instructions.

As a party has a duty to establish his or her title in a partition action and the

duty to investigate title by Court under section 25 of the Partition Law No. 21 of

1977, does not extend beyond evidence tendered to Court and also as the learned

district judge has said, as Josage Nonahamy has not referred to 8D.1 in

subsequent deeds, the petitioner cannot get rights on 8D.1.

In the circumstances, the petitioners application is dismissed. There is no order

on costs.
