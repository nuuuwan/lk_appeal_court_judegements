Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence imposed on

him by the learned High Court Judge of Kegalle.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Kegalle for causing the

death of Kiriammalakanda Lekamlage Disna Priyangika Senaviratne between

22nd April 1992 and 27th April 1992, and thereby committing the offence of

murder, an offence punishable in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code.

The retrial held against the appellant was before a jury. After the conclusion of

the trial, the jury entered a unanimous verdict of guilty against the appellant,

and accordingly, he was sentenced to death by the learned High Court Judge of

Kegalle by his sentence dated 11-12-2017.

It needs to be noted that the appellant has given his written consent for his

Counsel to argue this appeal in the absence of his personal presence in the

Court due to the prevailing COVID pandemic situation. However, he was

allowed to observe proceedings before the Court via Zoom platform from the

prison.

At the hearing of this appeal the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

Grounds of appeal: -

(1) On the material placed before the Court the jury could not have

reached a verdict of guilt.

(2) The learned trial judge failed to place material evidence before the jury

which amounts to a misdirection.

(3) The learned trial judge misdirected himself as to the evidence led in

his summing up.

The facts relating to the incident, briefly, are as follows;

The appellant who was a police officer, developed a love affair with the

deceased after visiting their house as a friend of her brother (PW-01). According

to the evidence of the brother, his sister left for employment in Abu Dhabi in

order to save enough money for her and the appellant to live as they intended

to get married. She has sent all the money she saved to the appellant expecting

him to build a house in Kurunegala. After she returned from overseas, she was

keen to get married to the appellant in order commence a life together. At the

instigation of the appellant PW-01 and his sister has gone to Kurunegala and

has contracted a marriage between the deceased and the appellant. About

fifteen days after the marriage the deceased went overseas again to earn money

to build the house the appellant has said that he was building, and has sent

her earnings to the appellant for that purpose. However, while overseas, she

has come to know through the sister of the appellant that he is already a

married man. This has prompted her to return to Sri Lanka and confront the

appellant. The marriage between the deceased and the appellant was later

found to be a bogus marriage. This has resulted in her making a complaint to

the higher police authorities against the appellant. During the period, the

deceased had also suffered a miscarriage.

Page 4 of 13

According to the evidence of the PW-01, despite all the problems faced by the

deceased and against the advice of the family members to distance from the

appellant, the deceased has maintained contact with the appellant.

On 22nd of April 1992 at about 11.00 am. while coming home from the market

where he worked, the PW-01 Fransis Senaviratne has seen his sister leaving

the house wearing a red-coloured skirt and a brown coloured long sleeved t-

shirt and going towards the short-cut road which leads towards Awissawella.

When questioned she did not reply, but he has later come to know from their

mother that the sister has informed her that she was going to Awissawella.

As the sister has not returned until the following day a complaint has been

lodged with the Awissawella police. In the meantime, the witness has come to

know from a person called Kalu Malli that through him the appellant gave a

call to his sister on the 22nd and it was the reason for his sister to leave the

house in order to meet the appellant.

On the 27th of April 1992, the witness has come to know that a body of a

female has been found in Kadugannawa. After going to the Mawanella police

and inquiring, the body of the deceased has been identified by PW-01 and other

family members at the Kandy police mortuary.

PW-03 Sumanawathi was the sister of the deceased who was instrumental in

getting her employment in Abu Dhabi where she was also employed. She has

confirmed the evidence of PW-01 about the deceased going overseas for

employment. It was her evidence that, after her sister was informed by the

sister of the appellant who was also employed there, that her brother was a

married man, she returned to Sri Lanka. She has known the appellant as the

person who got married to her sister. She is one of the relatives who has

identified the body of the deceased.

Roshan Rajapakshe (PW-11) was a person who had a timber store near the

police kennels in Wehara, Kurunagala. He has come to know the appellant who

was a police officer attached to the kennels and had developed a friendship

Page 5 of 13

with him. About three-four days before the appellant was arrested and brought

to his timber store, by the police, the appellant has come there with a female

and had wanted him to allow them to write a letter, for which he has

facilitated. It was the female who has written the letter and they have left after

about 20 minutes. He has seen both of them going towards the Kurunegala

town.

According to the evidence of Pathirannagalage Rohana (PW-21), the deceased

whom he identified as Manike Akka was well known to him. She lived near the

shop called Kaburapola Stores, where he worked as a sales assistant for over

eight years. As her house had no telephone facilities, she was in the habit of

coming to the shop in order to get telephone calls and also to receive. He knew

that the deceased had a relationship with Ariyaratne (the appellant) whom he

knew as a person worked in the Welikanda police at that time. He had met him

at the shop where he worked, and also at the home of Menike Akka the

deceased. It had been his evidence that the appellant came to his house in

Ehaliyagoda one day and wanted his assistance to contact the deceased over

the phone. As he was not working at the shop any longer, he has gone to the

Awissawella Post Office with the appellant and had taken a call to the shop

where he previously worked. Through the owner of the shop, he has spoken to

the deceased and had informed her that the appellant whom he referred to as

Ari Aiya has come to meet her. He has given this call to the deceased

somewhere between 8.00-9.00 in the morning. Accordingly, the deceased had

come to Awissawella and after she met up with the appellant near the hospital

bus stop, the witness has returned to his house. He has later come to know

through police that her dead body was found. Initially, he was also taken in as

a suspect, but later released.

The police officers who conducted investigations into this crime has given

evidence in this action and had explained their investigations.

Page 6 of 13

Dr A.B. Senaviratne (PW-27) was the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer (JMO)

who held the postmortem on the body of the deceased. He has observed several

fractures towards the right side of the temple of the deceased which has

extended towards the nose and the upper lip area. He has opined that this

injury was the main reason for the death and has clearly ruled out the

possibility of any animal bite or fall as the cause of this injury. It was his

opinion that this injury was a result of a blunt penetrating trauma. Apart from

the above-mentioned injury, the JMO has observed several broken vertebrae

among other injuries, which the JMO has attributed to either a result of a fall,

accident or an assault. Given the fact that the body of the deceased was found

in a partially decayed state and in precipice about 100 feet below the road, the

JMOs opinions as to the injuries are well explained by the other evidence.

When called for a defence at the conclusion of the prosecution case, the

appellant has chosen to give evidence under oath.

It was his stand that he came to know Fransis Senaviratne who was the

brother of the deceased Disna Priyangani in the year of 1986, while serving at

the Welikanda police. It was his evidence that he came to know that Disna

Priyangani along with one Elisabath Perera and Kalyanawathi ran a business

of foreign employment and he too paid a sum of Rs. 65000/- to the deceased in

order to secure foreign employment. It was his position that since she could not

secure his foreign employment as agreed, she returned a sum of Rs. 28507/56

by post while employed overseas. He has admitted that at the time of the

incident he was attached to the police kennels situated in Wehera and was

married to one Ajanatha Ediriweera, who was not the deceased. He has

contracted that marriage on 17-01-1990 and had a child out of that wedlock.

Explaining his not taking meals from the police mess on 22-04-1992, it was his

explanation that as a married officer he was not obliged to stay in the single

officers mess and he obtained his meals from outside.

Page 7 of 13

Admitting that he was arrested on the 30th of April 1992 and taken to

Mawanella police, it was his stand that he found another person known as

Kalu Malli, later identified as Rohana (PW-21) who was unknown to him and

his wifes brother under custody. He has denied any involvement in the death

of the deceased and any connection with her in his evidence in chief.

Under cross examination he has stated that after becoming friendly with the

brother of the deceased he has visited their house on several occasions and

had claimed that he came to know that the deceased got married to a cousin of

hers named K.L. Ariyaratne, around 1990. When questioned, he has admitted

that he has given calls to her, but has claimed that it was only due to the

friendship he had with her brother and for no other reason.

He has admitted that the deceased made a complaint against him to the police

headquarters stating that he got married to her and complaining that she gave

money and gold jewelry to him and she became pregnant due to him. Further,

he has admitted that the deceased came and met him in Kurunegala and they

went to the timber shop belonging to PW-11 and the deceased wrote a letter

from there. However, he has claimed that he only facilitated the deceased to

write a letter because she wanted to withdraw the complaint made against him

to the police headquarters. It was his position that after the letter was written

she left to hand over the letter and never met her thereafter. In the cross

examination, the prosecution has marked several contradictions in the

statement given by the appellant to the police.

After calling two other witnesses to support of his version of events the defence

case has been closed.

Following the summing up of the case by the learned High Court Judge to the

jury, the jury has returned a unanimous verdict of guilty against the appellant.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

As the grounds of appeal pursued by the learned Counsel are interrelated, they

will be considered together for the purposes of the appeal.

It needs to be mentioned that in a criminal action, be it before a jury or not, the

weaknesses in the defence put forward by an accused should not be a reason

to conclude that the prosecution has been proved, and proving the case against

an accused beyond reasonable doubt always remains with the prosecution.

In the case of Pantis Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 148, it was

held:

As the burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove its case

beyond reasonable doubt and no such duty is cast on the accused and it is

sufficient for the accused to give an explanation which satisfies the Court

or at least is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.

However, it is also settled law that it is the totality of the evidence that has to

be considered in a trial, be it for the prosecution or defence, rather than

compartmentalizing the evidence.

It was held in the case of James Silva Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1980)

2 SLR 167 that;

A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider

all the matters adduced before the Court, whether by the prosecution or by

the defence in its totality without compartmentalizing and, ask himself

whether as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he

believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty.

In the matter under appeal, there are no eyewitnesses to the actual crime. This

is a matter that has been decided on circumstantial evidence and evidence

consistent with the available circumstantial evidence.

Page 9 of 13

In view of the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that there

was not enough evidence and the learned High Court Judge failed to place

before the jury material evidence and also, he was misdirected in his summing

up to the jury, I find it necessary to consider the way a case should be

established before a Court of law by way of circumstantial evidence.

In the case of The King Vs. Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254 it was held:

Per Soertsz J.

In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the jury must be

satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the accused

and inconsistent with any reasonable hypotheses of his innocence.

In Don Sunny Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 01 it was held:

1) When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the

proved items of circumstantial evidence when taken together must

irresistibly point towards only inference that the accused committed the

offence. On consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can

be arrived at should be consistent with the guilt of the accused only.

2) If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence, if an

inference can be drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the

accused, then one cannot say that the charges have been proved

beyond reasonable doubt.

3) If upon consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence if

the only inference that can be drawn is that the accused committed the

offence, then they can be found guilty. The prosecution must prove that

no one else other than the accused had the opportunity of committing

the offence. The accused can be found guilty only if the proved items of

circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt and inconsistent

with their innocence.

Page 10 of 13

However, in considering the circumstantial evidence, what has to be considered

is the totality of the circumstantial evidence before coming to a firm finding as

to the guilt of an accused, although each piece of circumstantial evidence when

taken separately may only be suspicious in nature.

In the case of The King Vs. Gunaratne 47 NLR 145 it was held:

In a case of circumstantial evidence, the facts given in evidence may,

taken cumulatively, be sufficient to rebut the presumption of innocence,

although each fact, when taken separately, may be a circumstance only of

suspicion.

The jury is entitled to draw inferences unfavourable to an accused where

he is not called to establish an innocent explanation of evidence given by

the prosecution, which, without such explanation, tells for his guilt.

In the case of Regina Vs. Exall (176 English Reports, Nisi Prius at page

853) Pollock, C.B., considering the aspect of circumstantial evidence remarked;

It has been said that circumstantial evidence is to be considered as a

chain, and each piece of evidence as a link in a chain, but that is not so,

for then, if any one link brock, the chain would fall. It is more like the of a

rope composed of several cords. One strand of the rope might be

insufficient to sustain the weight, but three stranded together may be quite

of sufficient strength.

The evidence led in this case provides overwhelming circumstantial evidence

that points directly towards the culpability of the appellant for the murder of

the deceased. It is clear that after building up a romantic relationship with the

deceased, he has taken the maximum advantage of her. It clearly appears that

the deceased believed the appellant even after it was discovered that he has

deceived her right throughout their relationship.

Although it was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that

one of the main witnesses for the prosecution, namely, PW-21 Rohana was an

Page 11 of 13

unreliable witness, I have no reasons to agree. The fact that he was also

initially arrested along with the appellant is not a reason to consider him

unreliable. I find that the appellant's admission under oath that he met the

deceased in Kurunegala on the 22nd of April 1992, perfectly tallies with the

evidence of Rohana that it was he who arranged the meeting between the two

at the instigation of the appellant. Although the brother of the deceased has

stated in his evidence that he saw his sister leaving the house around 10.00

and 11.00 am on that day, he may be wrong as to the time. However, the fact

remains that she left the house on that morning in order to meet the appellant

and they were seen together in the afternoon by PW-11.

I find no basis for the argument that the time gap between 22nd of April where

the deceased was last seen and the discovery of her body on the 27th of April

was too far between to point the finger only at the appellant. The evidence of

the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) establishes the fact that the deceased would

have received the injuries to her head, which resulted in her death very close to

the day on which the deceased was seen in the company of the deceased.

I find no merit in the argument that the learned High Court Judge has failed to

place all the material before the jury and was misdirected as to the facts in his

summing up to the jury.

It is the duty of a High Court Judge in his summing up to a jury, who are a

group of laymen, to explain in plain and simple language the legal principles

that they should consider and place the available evidence before them. I find

that the learned High Court Judge has done just that. I am unable to find any

failure in placing material evidence before the jury as contended. Although the

last seen theory has not been put forward by the learned High Court Judge to

the jury in its strict sense, that does not mean that he was misdirected as he

has placed the evidence in that regard before the jury allowing them to decide. I

Page 12 of 13

find that it was the correct approach in a summing up, as if not, it would even

be amounting to influencing the minds of the jurors.

Although there is no burden of proof upon an accused in a criminal case, once

the prosecution establishes a very strong prima facie case against him, it

becomes necessary to consider whether a reasonable doubt has been created

as to the guilt of the accused or a reasonable explanation has been provided in

relation to the incriminating evidence against him.

Even though the appellant in his evidence has attempted to explain several

instances of incriminating evidence led against him, he has failed to cross

examine and confront the relevant witnesses in those lines so that the

witnesses have an opportunity to explain when they gave their evidence in

Court.

In the case of Sarwan Singh Vs. State of Punjab 2002 AIR Supreme Court iii

3652 at 3655 and 3656 it was stated that;

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to

avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in the cross examination it

must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted.

I find that in this action the appellant has failed to create any reasonable doubt

or to provide a reasonable explanation against the circumstantial evidence

available against him.

The only inference that can be drawn beyond reasonable doubt is that it was

the appellant who committed the murder of the deceased under the

circumstances. He was the only person so involved in her life and it was the

appellant who had all the reasons to get released from the issues he had to face

because of his own actions.

Page 13 of 13

A jury coming to a decision within a short span of time is not a reason to

conclude that they did not deliberate sufficiently as argued by the learned

Counsel for the appellant. What is necessary is to come to a correct finding and

reaching the right verdict, which I find the jury has correctly reached in this

action.

For the reasons aforesaid, I find no merit in the grounds of appeal urged. The

appeal therefore is dismissed. The conviction and the sentence affirmed.
