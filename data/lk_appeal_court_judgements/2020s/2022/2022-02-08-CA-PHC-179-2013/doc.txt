Prasantha De Silva, J.

Judgement The 1st Party-1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant had made a complaint to the Borella Police

Station saying that he has been occupying premises No. 1038/05, Maradana Road, Borella for

more than 32 years and he is operating a motor garage named Gamage Motors in the said

premises. The 2(a) 2nd Party-Respondent-Respondent had obstructed his entrance to the said

premises by constructing a gate.

It appears that 2(a) 2nd Party-Respondent-Respondent had made a statement to the Borella Police

Station that the land bearing assessment No. 1038 had been inherited by him from his father and

that there are three families occupying the said premises. The 1st Party-Respondent-Respondent-

Appellant and his family were occupying the questioned premises as tenants. Since they are no

longer in occupation of the premises and upon the request of the other occupants, 2(a) 2nd Party-

Respondent-Respondent had constructed a gate for security purposes.

Page 5 of 13

In the circumstances, the Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station-Borella filed information on

18.02.2013, under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act in the Magistrates Court of

Colombo, case bearing No.753/2/2012, on the basis of a breach of the peace over the right of way

to the property in dispute.

The Court ordered to affix notices on the disputed premises and thereafter the Intervenient

Respondent-Respondent-Respondent had intervened in the said Case.

After following the procedure stipulated in Part VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, parties

had filed their respective affidavits, counter affidavits and the documents.

It is pertinent to note that a separate case had been filed under Section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act in the Magistrates Court, Case bearing No. B 5749/02/12, in respect of the said

premises bearing assessment no. 1038/5.

Since this case at hand was regarding the entrance and/or the roadway to enter to the premises

bearing no. 1038/5, the learned Magistrate acting as the Primary Court Judge reserved the Order

to be pronounced after the pronouncement of the Order of the aforesaid case bearing no.B

5749/02/12.

The learned Judge delivered the Order of the said case bearing no. B 5749/02/12 on 20.03.2013,

not granting possession to either of the parties.

Subsequently, the learned Judge pronounced the Order in the instant case bearing No. 753/02/2012

on 17.05.2013, which states inter alia;

I. There was another application before this court under section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act bearing case no. 5749/02/12 between the Appellant, his wife, 2nd Party-

Respondents and the Intervenient Respondent of this Case;

II. The aforesaid case was regarding the possession of the property containing a house and

the Order of the said case had been delivered on 20.03.2013;

Page 6 of 13

III. The present case bearing no. 753/02/2012 is about blocking the entrance of the

aforesaid land containing a house.

IV. The application of the Appellant and his wife in the case bearing no. 5749/02/12 was

dismissed and the Appellant and his wife were not granted the possession of the land

containing the house since the Appellant and his wife had failed to prove the possession

of the land containing the house.

V. Therefore, the right of way to the aforesaid land will not be decided in this case and

parties are directed to resolve the matter regarding the ownership and possession of the

land and the right of way to the land in a competent Court.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the 1st Party-Respondent-Respondent-Appellant invoked the

Revisionary Jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Colombo by application dated

05.03.2013.

The said application was supported on 07.10.2013, seeking notices on the Respondents and having

reserved the right to support for interim relief inter-partes. However, the learned High Court Judge

pronounced the Order on 06.12.2013, refusing to issue notice on the Respondents on the basis that

there were no sufficient grounds to issue notice on the Respondents.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned High Court Judge, the 1st Party-Respondent-

Petitioner-Appellant [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant] invoked the Appellate

Jurisdiction of this Court to set aside the Order on the grounds mentioned in paragraph 19 (a)-(o)

in the Petition of Appeal.

According to the information filed under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act by the

Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station-Borella, and also the facts contained in the affidavits filed

by the respective parties, the dispute had arisen among the parties with regard to the premises

bearing No.1038/5 by fixing a gate blocking the access roadway.

In this respect, it is important to consider the affidavits filed by the respective parties in the instant

Case.

Page 7 of 13

The 1st Party in the Primary Court matter filed their affidavit on the main matter dated 28.03.2012

with documents marked 11 to 19 and had sought inter alia;

I. To declare that the Appellant and 1st Party-2nd Respondent have a servitude/roadway/right

to access, to use the roadway which is morefully reflected in 19, to enter the house and

the business premises of the Petitioner;

II. To make an Order removing the gate which obstructs the entrance which is morefully

reflected in 19 as B1;

III. To make an Order prohibiting all the disturbances relating to the right of way of the

Appellant and 1st Party-2nd Respondent.

The 2nd Party-Respondents filed their affidavits dated 28.03.2012 with documents marked 11 to

13 and had sought inter alia;

I. To declare that the 2nd Party-Respondents have the right to fix the gate which had been

fixed in the manner without disturbing any of the 1st Party Respondents (Appellant and 1st

Party-2nd Respondent);

II. To declare that the 2nd Party-Respondents have the right to fix the gate since the lessee

(Intervenient Respondent, who is as claimed by him as lessee) is not objecting to the same;

The Intervenient Respondent filed his affidavit dated 28.03.2012 seeking inter alia;

I. To make an Order declaring that the Intervenient Respondent is entitled to the possession

of the premises bearing assessment No: 1038/5 from 03.10.2010 to 02.10.2011;

II. To make an Order prohibiting all the disturbances of such possession.

After counter affidavit and written submissions were filed by all three parties, the case was fixed

for Order.

It is to be noted that before pronouncing the Order in the instant case, the 2nd Party-Respondent-

Respondents and the Intervenient Respondent-Respondent had informed Court that a separate

application under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act had been filed before the

Magistrates Court of Colombo, case bearing No. B 5749/02/12, regarding the possession of the

premises bearing assessment no. 1038/5. Since the instant case was in relation to the roadway to

enter the premises bearing no 1038/5, application was made by the 2nd Party-Respondent-

Page 8 of 13

Respondents and the Intervenient Respondent-Respondent to halt the proceedings of the instant

Case until final determination of the said Case bearing No. B 5749/02/12. Hence, the learned

Primary Court Judge reserved the Order to be pronounced after the pronouncement of the Order

of the aforesaid Case bearing No. B 5749/02/12.

The learned Primary Court Judge pronounced the Order on 20.03.2013 of case bearing No. B

5749/02/12, not granting possession to either of the parties and decided the instant Case on the

premise that, since the Appellant and his wife have failed to prove the possession of the land with

the house on the disputed premises in case bearing No. B 5749/02/12, it was held that the right of

way to the disputed land in the instant case [B 5749/02/12] will not be decided and parties were

directed to resolve the matter regarding the ownership and possession of the land and the right of

way to the land in a competent Court.

Since the dispute is relating to a roadway in the instant case, it clearly manifests that it has to be

determined in terms of Section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

Section 69 (1) states that;

Where the dispute relates to any right to any land or any part of a land, other than the

right to possession of such land or part thereof, the Judge of the Primary Court shall

determine as to who is entitled to the right which is the subject matter of the dispute

and make an Order under Subsection (2).

Section 69 (2) states;

An Order under this Subsection may declare that any person specified therein shall be

entitled to any such right in or respecting the land or in any part of the land as may be

specified in the Order until such person is deprived of such right by virtue of an Order

or decree of a competent court, and prohibit all disturbance or interference with the

exercise of such right by such party other than under the authority of an Order or decree

as aforesaid.

Apparently, the learned Primary Court Judge had failed to consider Section 69(1) of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act, where it is provided that the Primary Court Judge shall determine as to

who is entitled to the right of possession which is the subject of the dispute and shall make an

Page 9 of 13

Order under Section 69(2) of the Act and declare that any person specified therein shall be entitled

to the rights in dispute. Instead, the learned Primary Court Judge first dealt with the case bearing

No: B 5749/02/12 in terms of Section 68 of the said Act and decided that no person shall be entitled

to the possession of the disputed premises, but had not decided who is entitled to the right to

possession of the disputed portion of land.

In view of Section 69(1) and 69(2) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, it is a fundamental duty

of the Primary Court Judge, to determine as to who is entitled to the right which is the subject of

the dispute and make an Order under subsection 2 of section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act which is also a mandatory provision.

It is noteworthy that in the instant Case, the learned Primary Court Judge had depended on the

Order of the Case bearing No. 5749/02 and refused the application of the first Party only on that

ground. The relevant citation of the Order of the learned Primary Court Judge is as follows;

... 5749/02

, .

,

.

,

,

,....

It is apparent that the learned Primary Court Judge has not properly evaluated and analysed the

evidence placed before her when she made the impugned Order.

It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that, the learned Primary Court Judge ordered to affix

notices on the questioned premises on 18.01.2012 which were returnable on 01.02.2012. On this

day Intervenient Respondent appeared in Court and intervened in the instant Case. Thereafter, the

learned Primary Court Judge had warned the parties not to make any changes to the disputed

premises. However, despite the said warning by the learned Primary Court Judge, the 2nd Party-

Respondent-Respondents had demolished the garage run by the Appellant.

Page 10 of 13

The Court observes that the said garage is situated adjacent to the questionable premises [the

roadway] in the instant Case.

After demolition of the garage, the Appellant and the 1st Party-2nd Respondent filed an affidavit

and sought an interim Order on 15.02.2012. Subsequently, the 2nd Party-Respondents and the

Intervenient Respondent filed their objections to the said application and the learned Primary Court

Judge concluded to consider the Interlocutory Order at the pronouncement of the final

determination of the Case.

It is evident from the journal entry dated 19.09.2012, that the Respondent had agreed to hand over

a key to the 1st Party (The Appellant and the 1 Party-2nd Respondent). It clearly shows that the

Respondents had admitted the Appellant's right to access to the disputed land.

According to the statement dated 01.12.2011, made by the 1st Respondent of the 2nd Party to the

Borella Police, he had admitted the Appellants possession and his right to enter to the premises

stating that they were fixing the gate without blocking the Appellant's entrance.

.

. .

.

Furthermore, the 2nd Party-Respondents have sought an Order from the Primary Court by their

affidavit stating that they have a right to fix the gate since they have not disturbed the

possession/entrance of the Appellant and his wife

Prayer (1) - 1

,

The 2(c)-2nd Party-Respondent had admitted in her police statement that the Appellant

resides near her residence at premises bearing no. 1038/22, Maradana Road, Borella.

Page 11 of 13

... 1038/22, , , 08 .

...

Thus, the Respondents have never denied the Appellants and his wife's right to access to

the questioned premises in their affidavits filed in the instant case. The Appellant and his

wife had stated in their affidavit as follows in paragraphs 13 and 15 of the affidavit;

13.

It is relevant to note that section 72 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act provides for the learned

Primary Court Judge to determine the matter on the evidence placed before him.

According to Section 72 of the Act ;

A determination and Order under this part shall be made after examination and

consideration of the following:

(a) the information filed and the affidavits and documents furnished;

(b) such other evidence on any matter arising on the affidavits or documents furnished as

the Court may permit to be led on that matter; and

(c) such oral or written submission as may be permitted by the Judge of the Primary Court

in his discretion.

Page 12 of 13

Therefore, it is apparent that the learned Magistrate had not considered the evidence which had

been placed before the Primary Court by the parties, which clearly demonstrates the Appellants

right to use the said disputed portion of land as a roadway.

In this respect, it is to be observed that the roadway in question is the only road to access the

premises bearing assessment no. 1058/5 of Maradana Road, Borella, which the Appellant claimed

the possession of, in Primary Court Case bearing no: B 5749/02/12.

In Ramalingam Vs. Thangarajah (1982) 2 SLR 693 at page 699, it was held that,

On the other hand, if the dispute is with regard to any right to any land other than the

right of possession of such land, the question for decision, according to Section 69(1),

is who is entitled to the right which is the subject of dispute. The word "entitle" here

connotes the ownership of the right. The Court has to determine which of the parties

have acquired that right, or is entitled for the time being to exercise that right. In

contradistinction to Section 68, Section 69 requires the Court to determine the question

which party is entitled to the disputed right preliminary to making an Order under

Section 69(2).

In view of the said Judgment, it is pertinent to note that the Order dated 17.05.2013 of the learned

Primary Court Judge, not giving the right of way to the Appellant is made without considering the

relevant provisions of Law. Thus, the learned Magistrate has misdirected herself and made the

impugned Order. The leaned Primary Court Judge has erred in Law when she decided that no

person shall be entitled to the possession of the disputed premises, since she has a legal duty to

determine who is entitled to the possession after examination of the information filed by the police,

affidavits and documents filed by respective parties.

Apparently, the learned Primary court Judge had not given the possession or the premises bearing

assessment No. 1038/5 of Maradana Road, Borella to any party by the Order made in Case bearing

No. B 5749/02/12.

It is observed that the learned Primary Court Judge had made the Order in the instant case

considering the facts of the case bearing No. B 5749/02/12, when she was arriving at the decision

of the said Case.

Page 13 of 13

Therefore, it is seen that the learned Primary Court Judge had not considered the evidence placed

before her in the instant Case, and had arrived at a conclusion based on the Order made in Case

bearing No. B 5749/02/12.

Hence, the learned Primary Court Judge had erred in Law and facts and had dismissed the 1st Party-

1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellants Case which caused a grave injustice to the rights of the

Appellant.

In view of the aforesaid reasons, it clearly shows that the learned High Court Judge has failed to

properly evaluate the Law and facts of this case, when he decided that there was no sufficient cause

to issue notice on the Respondents. The learned High Court Judge has failed to appreciate that

there were exceptional circumstances of this case in order to invoke the Revisionary Jurisdiction

of the High Court;

Hence, I hold that the Order made by the learned Primary Court Judge dated 17.05.2012 is bad in

Law and should be set aside.

Similarly, the Order of the High Court dated 06.12.2013 dismissing the application of the

Appellant, which caused a grave injustice to the Appellant is also to be set aside.

Hence, we allow the appeal of the Substituted 1st Party-1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant. No

cost is awarded in this appeal and parties have to bear their own costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL K.K.A.V. Swarnadhipathi, J.

I agree.
