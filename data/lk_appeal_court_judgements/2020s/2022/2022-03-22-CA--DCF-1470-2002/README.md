JUDGMENT

A partition case was filed at the District Court of Homagama under case bearing No.200/P.

Plaintiff sought to partition the land called Balla Mala Pity Kumbura described in the schedule

to the Plaint dated 31.03.1983. On summons, the parties appeared before the Court. P.K.

Sumanadasa, Licensed Surveyor, made the preliminary Plan. He submitted to Court his Plan

and report bearing No.76/770 dated 10.06.1983 and marked as [X] and [X1] at the trial.

The parties filed their statement of claim. In their statement of claim, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Defendants admitted the corps and the averments in paragraphs 1-8 of the Plaint. The 5th

Defendant filed a statement of claim and prayed for a dismissal of the Plaint. According to him,

the land described in the Plaint and the land surveyed is Balla Mala Pitiya, alias Kolian

Kumbura. Lot No.4 in the preliminary Plan is a part of the land called Uswattha. Only the lots

No.1-3 is known as Balla Mala Pitiya alias Kolain Kumbura. Therefore, the 5th Defendant of

the District Court case has pleaded a separate pedigree for the land in lots No.1-3 of the

preliminary Plan.

Even though the 2nd and 3rd Defendants agreed with the identification of the land, they contested

the pedigree. At the trial, points of the contest were raised by all parties. Three points of the

contest were raised by Plaintiff and four points by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, and on behalf of

4(A) and 5th Defendants, eight points of the contest were raised.

At the conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge answered all points of the contest of

the Plaintiff and the 2nd and 3rd Defendants in the affirmative. All points of the contest of the

4(A) and 5th Defendants in the negative. No shares were allocated to the 4 (A) and the 5th

Defendants.

Aggrieved by this judgment, the Petition of appeal dated 21.01.2003 was filed by the 4 (A) and

the 5th Defendants. The Petition of Appeal is based on;

(a) Against the facts of law

(b) Against the evidence led in the case

(c) Deprivation of the rights of the Defendants who enjoyed the premises time

immemorially

(d) Illegal and unlawful

(e) Cemetery and/or monuments and public well were granted according to the

Plaintiffs pedigree without due regard to the claimants who established that the

graves and monuments belong to the generations. That will cause unimaginable

and unexpressive feelings and sensations to the Defendants of the deceased

whose bodies were laid there.

Therefore, the Defendants had prayed for;

(a) To set aside the judgment delivered on 26.11.2002.

(b) To grant the relief sought by the Defendants in their statement of claim

(c) For costs

(d) For such other and further relief, the Court shall seem to meet.

Both the Appellants and the Respondents filed their initial written submissions, and the matter

was taken up for argument. At the argument, Appellants have not set forward any facts that

need to be discussed regarding prayer (e) of their statements of claim. Therefore

Averment regarding graves and monuments will not be discussed in this judgment. However,

no other person had filed a Petition of Appeal on this issue.

In an appeal, the Appellant must prove the facts on which he relies. In appeal, the Appellants

sought to establish that Plaintiffs dishonesty, even though led in evidence, was not considered

by the learned Judge. There was evidence to show that Plaintiff had been dishonest at an

Page 4 of 5

examination and was punished. Then he had been in the Government service; the Appellants

had not established any flow in his service as a government officer. Therefore, the trial Judge

had not discussed the issue.

However, the Appellants have not established how that issue will support their appeal. The

preliminary survey was admitted at the trial by the Appellant. Their contention was even

though lots No.1-3 was Balla Mala Pitiya. Lot 4 was Kolain Kumbura. However, they failed

to call for a second survey.

They have not exercised their right to have a second survey to prove that the land is different.

They have failed to establish their claim by superimposing the preliminary Plan on another

plan. Such errors cannot be rectified. Mere stating a fact cannot be accepted as evidence without

proof. It is the duty of the party who makes the statement to prove it.

In the judgment, the land called Uswatha was discussed on documents and oral evidence. Deed

No.10082, marked as [18a], proves that the 4th Defendant, Gebrial Abeysinghe, had transferred

the land called Uswatha to his son Chandrajith Jayasiri Abeysinghe. According to the schedule

of that deed, the Northern boundary was Colombo-Ratnapura main road.

The Appellants had failed to prove that. Lot No.4 is inside the boundaries shown in that deed.

Documents marked [4V26 and 4V28], and some deeds produced by the 4th and the 5th

Defendants speak of a Kolain Kumbura. The Northern boundary in most of the deeds was

depicted as Balla Mala Pitiya Kumbura owned by Kin of Abeysinghe Achchi. Most of the

documents (deeds) produced in evidence by the Appellants bear that the Northern boundary is

Balla Mala Pitiya. Therefore, that proves that their deeds are not of Balla Mala Pitiya but an

adjoining land.

On this evidence, the learned District Judge had held that the Northern boundary of Kolain

Kumbura is Balla Mala Pitiya which was not the subject matter to be partitioned. The learned

District Judges position, therefore, need not be disturbed.

The evidence proved that specific constructions were done by the 4th and 5th Defendants. As

for the claim regarding the improvements, the 4(a) and the 5th Defendant-Appellants had not

appealed on that ground. Whatever points they raised is limited to proving their rights to the

Page 5 of 5

property. Therefore, I consider that the claims cannot be discussed based on fragments of

evidence. If claims are made clear, expenses incurred or improvements should be proved. A

person who builds in anothers land without permission cannot claim compensation. He does

so at his own risk.

However, as the land does not belong to Appellants, what stands in the land goes to whomever

it belongs to. In any event, the Appellants in their Petition of Appeal or their statements of

claim had not claimed compensation. Therefore, even though the issue of erecting

constructions by Appellants in the subject matter is mentioned, those cannot be counted as

improvements or points discussed in the appeal.

Therefore, on the strength of the reasons mentioned above, I reject the Appellants Appeal

subject to taxed costs.
