MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to set aside the order of the learned High Court

Judge of Anuradhapura dated 30 of November 2016.

The accused petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) has been charged in

the Magistrates Court under 18 (1) of the Food act for allegedly storing a stock of

tamarind which was not suitable for human consumption.

Upon the conclusion of the trial the learned Magistrate had convicted the petitioner

and the High Court also had affirmed the said order of the Magistrate.

The Counsel for the petitioner submitted to Court that the alleged substance retained

by the petitioner,

1) Does not fall within the definition of the Food act,

2) That there is no authorized person in the area in which the petitioner is supposed

to have committed the offences,

3) The alleged tamarind taken in to custody does not fall within the meaning of the

regulations made in the gazette notification no 637/18.

The main offence committed by the petitioner is that he had contravened section 2 of

the act and thereby committed an offence under section 18 of the Act, section 2 of

the act prohibits manufacture importation, sale and distribution of food which are

not suitable for human consumption.

Therefore the term food had been defined in section 33 of the act.

But according to the provisions of the act the relevant minister also can make

regulations and have to be gazette for implementation. According to the offences

Page 4 of 5

defined in the said act a person who contravenes a regulation also commits an

offence.

Hence the main contention of the petitioner is that the regulations made by way of

gazette notification 637/18, tamarind is defined to be without seed, but the tamarind

retained by the petitioner had been with seed.

But according to the provisions of the act the term food had been very clearly defined

and tamarind clearly falls within that meaning with or without seed. The act had been

enacted for the purpose of regulating, controlling, manufacturing, sale and

distribution of food, and regulations are made to facilitate the said matter.

Hence section 33 of the act defines what a food item is and what the regulation has

done is to define the term tamarind, but the broader perspective of section 33 of the

principle act does not exonerate the petitioner merely for the reason that the

tamarind he had stored does not fall within the meaning of the regulation 637

because the act has been enacted by parliament, and none other.

Hence if the petitioner had stored tamarind with seeds or without in unsuitable

conditions for human consumption he had committed an offence under the

provisions of the act.

Therefore this Court sees no merit in the submission that the tamarind retained by

the petitioner was not a food item as per the regulations hence the learned High

Court Judge has misinterpreted the Food Act.

The other contention is that there was no person in authority to obtain a license for

storing is also unfounded for the reason that if a person in authority has not been

appointed as per the act, the medical officer of the area becomes an authorized

person according to the provisions of the act.

Hence this Court sees no merit in the application of the petitioner as such the

application is hereby dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
