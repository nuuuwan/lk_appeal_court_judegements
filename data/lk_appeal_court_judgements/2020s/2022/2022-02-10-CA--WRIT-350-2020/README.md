Argued on: 15.11.2021

Decided on: 10.02.2022

S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

By this Writ Application the Petitioner challenges the procedure followed by the 1st

Respondent under the Land Acquisition Act, No. 9 of 1950 (as amended) (hereinafter

referred to as the Act) to recover the possession of her land for Moragahakanda-

Kaluganga Development Project (hereinafter referred to as the Project) implemented

under the Ministry of Mahaweli. The Petitioners land is 60 Acres in extent and one of

the lands which she has inherited from her paternal grandmother. The paternal

grandmother and the grandmothers brother who hails from Dullewa family had 6500

Acres of land and from time to time their lands were acquired by the State. Ultimately

the Petitioner and her 7 siblings were left with only 380 Acres. The land in dispute

known as Dikyaya is one of the remaining lands. It is situated at Amunawela village

within the Grama Niladhari Division of Akarahendiya in the Divisional Secretariat area

of Laggala in Matale District. A decision was taken by the State to acquire lands for

resettlement of displacing families of the area due to the implementation of the Project

and accordingly, a Notice (marked as P 13) was exhibited in terms of section 2 of the

Act, to identify a land within the boundaries mentioned in the schedule to the Notice in

3

the area of Akarahediya - Ward No. E 396 B Grama Niladhari Division. It is the position

of the Petitioner that even though, the impugned land owned by her is situated in

Akarahediya Grama Niladhari Division, it is not situated within the boundaries

mentioned in the schedule to the Notice. Nevertheless, the Petitioner alleges that the 1st

Respondent published a Gazette Notification dated 27.08.2020 (marked as P 23 (c))

granting power to the 2nd Respondent to recover the possession of her land under the

proviso (a) to the section 38 of the Act and accordingly, the 2nd Respondent sent a letter

dated 14.09.2020 (marked as P 23) demanding to hand over the vacant possession of

the land by 22.09.2020. The position of the Petitioner is that the 1st and 2nd Respondents

are attempting to take the possession of her land acting under proviso (a) to the section

38 of the Act even though, the steps had not been taken in terms of sections 2 or 4 to

acquire the land. Therefore, by this writ Application she seeks to quash the Order

published by the 1st Respondent in the Gazette Notification marked as P 23 (c) granting

powers to the 2nd Respondent to recover the possession of the impugned land and the

letter marked as P 23 sent by the 2nd Respondent to the Petitioner demanding to hand

over the vacant possession of the land. The position of the Respondents is that the

impugned land is situated within the area described in the schedule to the Notice

exhibited under section 2 of the Act and therefore, the Order published in the Gazette

by the 1st Respondent under the proviso (a) to the section 38 of the Act and the letter

sent by the 2nd Respondent to the Petitioner demanding to hand over the vacant

possession of the land is legal.

Section 38 of the Act states thus;

At any time after an award is made under section 17, the Minister may by Order

published in the Gazette-

(a) where the award relates to the acquisition of any land, direct the acquiring officer

of the district in which that land is situated, or any other officer authorized in that

4

behalf by such acquiring officer, to take possession of that land for and on behalf of

Her Majesty, or

(b) where the award relates to the acquisition of any servitude, declare that the land

over which that servitude is to be acquired shall be subject to that servitude:

Provided that the Minister may make an Order under the preceding provisions of this

section-

(a) where it becomes necessary to take immediate possession of any land on the ground

of any urgency, at any time after a notice under section 2 is exhibited for the first time

in the area in which that land is situated or at any time after a notice under section 4 is

exhibited for the first time on or near that land, and

(b) where it becomes necessary immediately to acquire any servitude on the ground of

any urgency, at any time after a notice under section 4 is exhibited for the first time on

or near the land over which that servitude is to be acquired.

Therefore, it is clear that the proviso (a) to the section 38 provides a mandatory

requirement that sections 2 or 4 Notice should exhibit before making an Order by the

Minister to recover the possession of a land.1

The fundamental matter which this Court should consider in this writ Application is

whether the impugned land owned by the Petitioner is situated within the area

mentioned in the schedule to the section 2 Notice. The position of the Petitioner is that

her land is situated not within the area mentioned in the schedule to the section 2 Notice

whereas the position of the Respondents is that it is situated within that area. As alleged

by the Petitioner, if her land is not situated within the area mentioned in the schedule to

the section 2 Notice, the Order made by the 1st Respondent under the proviso (a) to the

section 38 of the Act is illegal and ultra vires and therefore, the letter issued by the 2nd

1 W. Neela De Silva and other vs Chamal Rajapakse and 11 others, CA (WRIT) Application No. 1748/2006

dated (24.08.2007).

5

Respondent demanding to hand over the possession of the land is also illegal and ultra

vires. If so, the decision containing in the Gazette Notification published by the 1st

Respondent and the letter sent by the 2nd Respondent to the Petitioner are liable to be

quashed. If the land is situated, within the area mentioned in the schedule to the section

2 Notice, the Application for Writs is liable to be dismissed. The submission of the

learned Deputy Solicitor General appeared for the Respondents was that the steps had

been taken to acquire all the lands situated in Akarahediya Grama Niladhari Division

in Amunuwela village for the Project and section 2 Notice marked as 2R2 was exhibited

to identify all the lands situated in the entire area of Akarahediya Grama Niladhari

Division. The same document has been marked as P 13 by the Petitioner also. The

argument of the learned DSG is that, since the land in dispute is situated in the

Akarahediya Grama Niladhari Division, section 2 Notice applies to that land as well.

The submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the section 2 Notice

exhibited does not apply to the entire Grama Niladhari Division of Akarahediya and it

applies only to the Ward E 396 B of Akarahediya Grama Niladhari Division. The

learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner therefore, argued that since the Petitioners

land is situated not within the area which section 2 Notice applies and the steps have

not been taken as yet to acquire her land, the possession of that land could not be

recovered under the proviso (a) to the section 38.

As per the submissions made by the learned DSG, Advanced Tracing bearing No.

Ma/LGG/2017/567 dated 31.05.2018 marked as 2R1 had been prepared by the

Surveyor General to show the entire area which the section 2 Notice was exhibited and

the impugned land is situated within the area which shows in the Advanced Tracing

marked 2R1. Even though, the appropriate and acceptable way of establishing that the

impugned land is situated within the area shown in the Advanced Tracing is making a

superimposition plan, a superimposition plan has not been prepared. On the other hand,

as contended by the learned DSG if that Notice covers the entire Grama Niladhari

Division of Akarahediya and since 2R1 shows the entire Grama Niladhari Division of

6

Akarahediya, a necessity does not arise to prepare a superimposition plan. The schedule

to the section 2 Notice dated 19.05.2009 reads as follows;

-

(E396B) ;

- E402B, E402

- 397A,396A,396C

- 397C, 397A, 396A 396C

-

According to that schedule, the area which the investigation under section 2 was

intended to be done to select a suitable land for acquisition had been Ward No. E 396

B of the Akarahediya Grama Niladhari Division. It appears that all four boundaries

other than the western boundary of the land mentioned in the schedule are the different

Wards in the Akarahediya Grama Niladhari Division. Therefore, it is apparent that the

lands intended to be acquired were not the entire lands situated in the Akarahediya

Grama Niladhari Division, but the lands situated in Ward No. E 396 B in Akarahediya

Grama Niladhari Division.

The Application submitted by the 3rd Respondent through the Minister of Mahaweli to

the Minister of Land (the 1st Respondent) in 2008 in terms of Clause 248 (b) 3 of the

Land Manual to acquire a land has been submitted to Court marked as 2R6(a). It has

been specifically stated in sub-item (v) of item No.4 that the 3rd Respondent needs a

land situated in the Ward No. E 396 B of Akarahediya Grama Niladhari Division.

Furthermore, the boundaries of the land mentioned in the schedule to the section 2

Notice and the boundaries of the land mentioned under item No.16 of the Application

are identical. Therefore, it is apparent that section 2 Notice has been exhibited to

7

identify a suitable land situated in Ward No. E 396 B in Akarahediya Grama Niladhari

Division and not from the entire Akarahediya Grama Niladhari Division.

On behalf of the 3rd Respondent, a letter dated 07.08.2019 written by the Project

Director of the 3rd Respondent to the Secretary to the Ministry of Mahaweli is marked

as 3R19. In paragraph 5 of that letter, it has been stated thus;

Ma/LGG/2017/567 A

,

.

,

38 ()

The lot A in the Advanced Tracing mentioned in that letter is the impugned land owned

by the Petitioner and that Advanced Tracing is produced to Court marked as 2R1. When

considering the above stated facts mentioned in 3R19, it is apparent that the Project

Director of the 3rd Respondent had admitted that the impugned land is a private land

which is situated in the middle of the area which was developed under the Project.

It has been stated in paragraph 7 of the same letter that;

,

,

,

02

Therefore, it is clear that the said Officer had further admitted that other than the

impugned land there are other private lands in the vicinity and the steps have been

8

initiated to recover the possession of those lands also in term of the proviso (a) to the

section 38 of the Act.

According to the schedule to the section 2 Notice, the extent of the land intended to be

identified for the acquisition is about 464 Hectares. In the annexure to the Notice, the

extents of the land which forms the land described in the schedule and the names of the

owners of those lands are given individually. The total extent of the lands mentioned in

that annexure is approximately 464 Hectares. Therefore, it is apparent that the section

2 Notice relates only to the lands mentioned in the annexure. In that annexure, neither

the Petitioners name nor a land in extent of 60 Acres is mentioned. The learned DSG

appearing for the Respondent submitted to Court that only the names of the land owners

who could be identified by that time were included into the annexure. The Court cannot

accept that submission of the learned DSG for the reason that the extent mentioned in

the schedule to the Notice tallies with the extent of the lands mentioned in the annexure.

Therefore, it is apparent that the land owned by the Petitioner is not situated within the

area which the section 2 Notice was exhibited.

A letter dated 12.10.2017 has been tendered to the Court by the Petitioner marked as P

18. In that letter the 2nd Respondent has requested from the Surveyor General to survey

the impugned land owned by the Petitioner for acquisition on the premise of the details

mentioned in the section 2 Notice. It is important to note that the section 2 Notice is

dated 19.05.2009 and the request made by P18 to survey the impugned land is dated

12.10.2017. Therefore, it is clear that the 2nd Respondent has requested from the

Surveyor General by the P 18 to survey the impugned land after about eight years from

the date of the section 2 Notice was exhibited. P 18 further states that it was later found

that even though there are lands which the owners and the possessors could be

identified, those lands were not included into the preliminary survey done for the

acquisition. Therefore, that document elicits the fact that even though, the impugned

land had not been initially included into the preliminary survey which the section 2

9

Notice applies, the 2nd Respondent later wanted to include it to the acquisition by

executing a subsequent survey.

A letter dated 18.01.2021 has been tendered to the Court by the 2nd Respondent marked

as 2R6(b) to prove that the impugned land is situated within the area mentioned in the

section 2 Notice. The letter has been issued by the Government Surveyor to the 2nd

Respondent. In that letter it is stated that the impugned land is situated within the

Akarahediya Grama Niladhari Division. But it does not say that the impugned land is

situated within Ward No. E 396 B in the Akarahediya Grama Niladhari Division, in

which a land wanted to be identified for the acquisition.

Furthermore, a sketch which shows the entire area intended to be acquired is tendered

to Court marked as 3R14 (a). In that sketch, the impugned land is drawn and coloured

manually. 3R14 (a) is a computer-generated document and not a plan prepared by a

surveyor according to the surveying standards.

The Respondents have relied on a letter marked as 2R7 written by the Petitioner to the

2nd Respondent. In that letter the Petitioner has stated, inter alia, that she is the owner

of the impugned land, it is due to be acquired for the Project, inadvertently it is not

included in the list of lands which were intended to be acquired, the Superintendent of

Surveyors has identified her land as a land which is due to be acquired. The learned

DSG argued that by that letter, the Petitioner had admitted that the impugned land is

situated within the area which section 2 Notice relates. The position of the Petitioner is

that she had written it due to the misinterpretation of facts by the Respondents that in

as much as her property was not included in the formal statutory acquisition process

and in as much as the State would in any event take possession of the land, she would

be placed in a situation where she would neither have the property, nor compensation.

When coming to a conclusion, the Court cannot consider 2R7 in insolation and it should

be considered with the other evidence placed before the Court. When weighing the

evidence of both parties, the Court can be satisfied that the Petitioner has placed strong

10

evidence to establish that the impugned land is situated outside the area which the

section 2 Notice relates.

When considering all the above stated facts and circumstances, it is evident that the

impugned land owned by the Petitioner is situated not within the area which the section

2 Notice was exhibited and at the time of exhibiting the Notice the Respondents had no

intention to identify a land in the area which the impugned land is situated for

acquisition. In terms of the proviso (a) to the section 38 it is a mandatory requirement

that before making an Order to recover possession of a land section 2 Notices should

be exhibited.

In their book on Administrative Law, H. W. R Wade and C. F Forsyth articulate that,

Procedural safeguards, which are so often imposed for the benefit of persons affected

by the exercise of administrative powers, are normally regarded as mandatory, so that

it is fatal to disregard them.2

Furthermore, Alex Carroll elaborates that,

A mandatory procedural requirement must be complied with if the action or decision

taken is to be valid in law. As a general principle such a requirement will be regarded

as mandatory if non-compliance with it might cause substantial prejudice to the person

or persons affected by the exercise of the power. The requirement will usually have

been imposed to improve the quality of the decision-making process.3

The cardinal principle of ultra vires is of two forms i.e., substantive ultra vires and

procedural ultra vires. Procedural ultra vires is the declaration of invalidity for reason

of non-compliance with the procedure laid down by statute or failure to comply with

the rules of natural justice or mandatory procedure.

In the landmark decision of Council of Civil Service Union v. Minister for the Civil

Service (GCHQ Case)4, Lord Diplock stipulated the grounds of Judicial Review as

follows,

Judicial review has I think developed to a stage today when without reiterating any

analysis of the steps by which the development has come about, one can conveniently

classify under three heads the grounds upon which administrative action is subject to

control by judicial review.

The first ground I would call illegality, the second irrationality and the third

procedural impropriety.

By illegality as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision-maker must

understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must give

effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a justiciable question to be decided,

in the event of dispute, by those persons, the judges, by whom the judicial power of the

state is exercisable.

I have described the third head as procedural impropriety rather than failure to

observe basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with procedural fairness towards

the person who will be affected by the decision. This is because susceptibility to judicial

review under this head covers also failure by an administrative tribunal to observe

procedural rules that are expressly laid down in the legislative instrument by which its

jurisdiction is conferred, even where such failure does not involve any denial of natural

justice.

In the instant action, since no Notice has been exhibited under section 2 of the Act in

the area which the impugned land is situated, I hold that the attempts of the Respondents

4 (1985) AC 374(HL) at page 950 and 951.

12

to take the possession of the impugned land in terms of the proviso (a) to the Section

38 of the Act are illegal and ultra vires. Therefore, I hold that the Petitioner is entitled

to writs of Certiorari to quash the Order of the 1st Respondent containing in the Gazette

Notification marked as P 23 (c) and the Demand of the 2nd Respondent containing in

the letter marked as P 23 to hand over the possession of the impugned land to him and

writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 1st - 3rd Respondents from recovering the possession

of the said land in terms of the proviso (a) to the section 38 of the Act. Accordingly, the

reliefs prayed for in the prayers (d) and (e) in the Petition dated 20.09.2020 are granted.

This decision should not affect the rights of the Respondents to take necessary legal

steps to acquire the impugned land of the Petitioner, if necessary, in the future. The 1st

- 3rd Respondents should pay Rs.20, 000/= each to the Petitioner as the costs of this

Application.
