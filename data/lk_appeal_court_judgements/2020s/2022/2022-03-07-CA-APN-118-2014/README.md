Before Menaka Wijesundera J.

Neil Iddawala J.

Counsel Rienzie Arsecularatne, PC with Punsri Gamage for petitioner.

Chathuranga Bandara, SC for State.

Argued On 26.01.2022

Decided On 07.03.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to revise the order of the learned

High Court Judge of Kegalle dated 16.2.2005 and the judgment of the Magistrate

dated 11.7.2001.

In the instant matter accused appellant petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

petitioner) was charged in the Magistrates Court for being in possession of illicit

liquor.

Upon the conclusion of the trial the Magistrate has convicted him and the petitioner

had lodged an appeal in the High Court and the High Court Judge had affirmed the

order of the Magistrate.

Being aggrieved by the said order the petitioner had initially lodged an appeal to

this Court and the said appeal had been dismissed due to lack of jurisdiction in

2012.

Thereafter in 2014 the instant application for revision has been filed.

Page 4 of 6

The main contention of the Counsel for the petitioner is that the,

1) Charge in the Magistrate Court has not been signed by the Magistrate,

2) The charge had not been read over to the petitioner.

At this point this Court notes that the petitioner had been represented by a Counsel

in the Magistrates Court and the petitioner had in fact had made a statement from

the dock as his defense. Therefore the petitioner being ignorant of the charge is

very difficult to understand.

Nevertheless the Counsel for the petitioner cited a judgment by his Lordship Justice

Aluvihare , SC APPEAL 115/2014, where his Lordship has held that noncompliance

of section 182 of the Criminal Procedure Code in the Magistrate Court is fatale

especially in view of the fact that an accused being represented by an attorney at

law is not mandatory, and his Lordship has gone to add that it should be

considered in the light of the proviso to article 138 (1) of the constitution to see

whether substantial miscarriage of justice has taken place.

In the instant matter as stated above this Court notes that the petitioner had been

represented by a counsel in the Magistrates Court and trial had gone on from

1999 to 2001 from the date the petitioner had pleaded not guilty to the charge,

and on any of the days the objection to the charge had not been taken up.

Therefore as stated by His Lordship in the above mentioned case when

considering in view of the proviso to article 138 (1) of the Constitution this Court

has to seriously consider whether the petitioner had been prejudiced by a charge

which had not been signed by the magistrate and which had not been read over to

the petitioner.

Page 5 of 6

But this Court notes that the said objection although taken up at this stage had not

been taken up in the Magistrates Court neither in the High Court although the

services of an attorney at law had been obtained by the petitioner at each level.

Therefore it is the observation of this Court that the petitioner being prejudiced by

the charge in the instant case, is unacceptable because he had been represented by

an attorney at law right through out and the trial had gone for nearly three years

during which time the petitioner had ample time to understand that there is a

defect in the charge.

Therefore even if there is a violation of section 182 of the Criminal Procedure

Code as submitted by the petitioner, it is the opinion of this Court that the rights

of the petitioner had not been violated as per the proviso to article 138 of the

constitution as stated by His Lordship in the above mentioned case especially in

view of the fact that the petitioner had been represented by a Counsel.

The Counsel for the respondents contended that there is a delay of nine years since

the initial judgment by the Magistrates Court and such delay is fatal in an

application of this nature.

We do see that there is a very long delay in this matter, which the petitioner had

attributed to be the lapse on the part of the legal assistance he has sought, but this

Court notes that even after obtaining proper legal advice as stated by the petitioner

there is a lapse of two years to which his explanation to this Court is not very

plausible. Delay has been considered to be fatal and it has been discussed in many

of our cases and one such is Rajapakse vs. The state (2001)2 SLR 161,in which it

was decided that if Court were to act in revision the party must come before

Court without unreasonable delay. The same had been held in the case of

Camillus Ignatius vs. OIC of Uhana Police station (Rev) CA 907/89 where it was

Page 6 of 6

said that mere delay of 4 months in filling revision was fatal. This Bench too had

held similarly in the case of CA/PHC/APN 78/2021.

The Counsel for the respondents further submitted that the objection to the charge

has been taken up for the first time before this Court and that it is a belated

position, and went on to cite a judgment of Her Ladyship Justice Wickremesinghe in

the case of CA (PHC) 180/2014 in which it had been held that an objection to a

charge should be taken up at the very first instance.

Therefore we note that the petitioner had filed the instant application after a

lapse of time period which has not been explained by the petitioner in a

satisfactory manner and further more this Court also note that the objection to

the charge in the Magistrates Court had not be taken up either in the High Court

nor at the Magistrates Court, hence that too is belated.

Therefore for the reasons set out above this Court sees no exceptional reason to allow the instant application for revision and such it is hereby dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
