In this writ application, the Petitioner, Rekadahena Plantations (Pvt.) Ltd, seeks reliefs,

inter alia, writs of Certiorari to quash the award of the 1st Respondent who was

appointed by the Minister of Labour under section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act

(the Act) in favour of the 7th added Respondent and quash the Gazette Notification

bearing No. 2086/41 dated 31.08.2012 published the said award by the Commissioner

General of Labor (the 2nd Respondent). The 7th added Respondent worked as a Field

Officer in the Rekadahena Plantation (Pvt) Ltd. Through Lanka Estates Staffs Union

(the 6th Respondent) he complained to the Commissioner of Labor (the 3rd Respondent)

that he was ejected from his official quarters. Nevertheless, Rekadahena Plantation

(Pvt.) Ltd denied that allegation. Then the matter was referred by the Minister of Labor

6. Lanka Estate Staffs Union,

(On behalf of Anura Wasantha Adihetti) No. 06, Aloe Avenue, Colombo 03

Respondents

3

(the 5th Respondent) to the 1st Respondent for arbitration in terms of section 4(1) of the

Industrial Dispute Act, No. 43 of 1950 (as amended) (hereinafter referred to as the Act).

At the end of the Arbitration process the 1st Respondent held that the 7th added

Respondent should be entitled to an award of Rs. 200,000/- (document marked as P9).

After the award was published in the Gazette Notification marked as P10, the Petitioner

field repudiation papers against the award. By P9, the 1st Respondent ordered the

Rekadahena Plantation (Pvt) Ltd to pay Rs. 200,000/= to the 7th added Respondent for

the mental injuria caused to him as a result of sudden ejectment from the quarters and

the damages caused to his furniture. One of the arguments of the learned Counsel for

the Petitioner is that under the labour legislation of the Country, an Arbitrator has no

power to grant awards for mental injuria.

In addition to the written submissions filed by the Petitioner, at the argument the learned

Counsel appearing for the Petitioner made a lengthy oral submission. On behalf of the

2nd - 5th Respondents the learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted to Court that he

is ready to abide by any decision of the Court. The Petitioner has tendered further

written submissions after the conclusion of the argument.

One of the arguments of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that there are factual

errors in the reference made by the Minster to the 1st Respondent for Arbitration and

even though, citing those errors on behalf of the Petitioner an application had been

made before the commencement of the arbitration proceedings to the 1st Respondent to

re-refer the reference to the Minsters to correct those errors, the 1st Respondent did

not allowed that application but commenced the inquiry on the defective reference

and concluded the inquiry.

Section 4(1) of the Act provides thus;

the Minister may, if he is of the opinion that an industrial dispute is a minor dispute,

refer it, by an order in writing, for settlement by arbitration to an arbitrator appointed

by the Minister or to a labour tribunal, notwithstanding that the parties to such dispute

or their representatives do not consent to such reference.

If there were any errors in the reference made by the Minster to the 1st Respondent

and if the Petitioner was not satisfied with the Order made by the 1st Respondent

regarding the preliminary objection raised on the reference, the Petitioner could have

taken legal actions against the reference and the Order of the 1st Respondent.

4

Nevertheless, he has not taken any action against the reference and/or the Order.

Therefore, it is the view of this Court that the Petitioner is not entitled to canvass those

facts belatedly in this writ application.

The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner submitted to Court that the 1st

Respondent has decided that the 7th added Respondent was given official quarters and

he was ejected on the facts stated in the reference of the Minister, but not on the

evidence placed before the 1st Respondent Therefore, the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner argued that the award marked as P9 is against the provisions of section 17

(1) of the Act. Section 17(1) stipulates thus;

When an industrial dispute has been referred under section 3(1) (d) or section 4(1) to

an arbitrator for settlement by arbitration, he shall make all such inquiries into the

dispute as he may consider necessary, here such evidence as may be tendered by the

parties to the dispute, and thereafter make such award as may appear to him just and

equitable. A labour tribunal shall give priority to the proceedings for the settlement of

any industrial dispute that is referred to it for settlement by arbitration.

This Court cannot subscribe to the above stated submission of the learned Counsel for

the Petitioner for the reason that when arriving at the decision marked as P9, the 1st

Respondent has considered the evidence of the 7th Respondent, the Police complaint

marked as 5/6 made by the 7th Respondent after he was ejected, the evidence of the

President of the Trade Union Mr. Dhammika Karunasiri Jayawardhana that he had

visited the quarters during the time which the 7th added Respondent was occupying the

quarters and he was ejected from the quarters (at page 261 of the brief), the evidence of

the Assistant Manager Dushana on behalf of the Petitioner that the 7th added

Respondent was given one of the quarters allocated to the Watchers (at page 262 of the

brief). In the Written submissions tendered to the Court on behalf of the Petitioner, it

has been stated that nowhere in the evidence of the Assistant Manager Mr. Dhushan

that the 7th added Respondent was ejected. The witness has admitted that the 7th added

Respondent was given quarters. The letter issued by the Superintendent marked as 4

when allocating the quarters to the 7th added Respondent corroborates the said evidence

of Mr. Dhushan. His evidence has been that on the instructions of the Chairman he had

taken steps to seal the quarters, which were in a dilapidated condition using wooden

hasp (at page 180 of the brief). There is no evidence that the 7th Respondent handed

5

over the vacant possession of the quarters to the Petitioner or that he was dispossessed

through any legal process. Therefore, the evidence of Mr. Dhushan on behalf of the

Petitioner establishes the fact that the 7th Respondent has been ejected.

When exercising writ jurisdiction, the Court considers the legality of the decision and

the question as to whether the act or order under attack should be allowed to stand. In

Best Footwear (Pvt) Ltd., and Two Others Vs. Aboosally, Former Minister of Labour

& Vocational Training and Others1, F. N. D. Jayasuriya, J. held that,

The remedy by way of certiorari cannot be made use of to correct errors or to

substitute a correct order for a wrong order. Judicial review is radically different from

appeals. When hearing an appeal, the Court is concerned with the merits of the decision

under appeal. In judicial review, the court is concerned with its legality. On appeal the

question is right or wrong. On review, the question is whether the act or order is lawful

or unlawful. Instead of substituting its own decision for that of some other body as

happens when an appeal is allowed, a court on review is concerned only with the

question whether the act or order under attack should be allowed to stand or not.

Therefore, in view of the above stated authority in the instant application this Court

cannot consider the above stated submissions and arguments of the learned Counsel for

the Petitioner. In this writ application, the Court can only consider the legality of the

order of the 1st Respondent to pay Rs.200,000/= for the mental injuria caused to the 7th

added Respondent considering the unexpected ejectment and the damages caused to his

furniture and whether that award should be allowed to stand. The argument of the

learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the 1st Respondent has no jurisdiction to make

an award for mental injuria. The learned Counsel submitted to the Court that this Court

in the applications bearing Nos 451/07 and 452/87 held that the Industrial Law does

not make provisions to order compensation for pain of mind and humiliation. The

Petitioner has failed to tender copies of those Orders/Judgments to Court The learned

Counsel has also quoted a portion of the judgment of Jayasuriya Vs, Sri Lanka State

Plantations Corporation2, which states;

1 (1997) 2 SLR 137. 2 (1995) 2 Sri L.R. 379.

Now, losses can be of various kinds; but the matter for consideration in this kind of

case is the financial loss, and not sentimental harm caused by the employer. In his

petition to this Court, dated 25, September1990, the Petitioner refers to the fact that he

was undergoing hardships, both financially and mentally

In terms of section 17 (1) of the Act, an Arbitrator could make an award which appears

to him just and equitable. In the case of United Engineering Workers Union Vs K.W.

Devanayagan3 Court opined that the award of an arbitrator has to be one which appeals

to the arbitrator just and equitable and they are given an unfettered discretion to do

what they think is right and fair. What is meant by just and equitable was discussed

in the case of Peris Vs Podisinhgo4. It was held that the test of just and equitable order

is that those equalities would be apparent to any fair-minded person reading the order

(at page 48). Nevertheless, the order should be within the framework of law (Richard

Pieris & Co. Ltd Vs. Wijesiriwardena5). The powers and duties of an arbitrator under

the Act and of a labor tribunal in a reference of an industrial dispute are the same. In

Arnolda Vs Gopalan6 it was held that the Labour Tribunal derives its jurisdiction from

the Industrial Disputes Act. The powers of the Labour Tribunal to make a just and

equitable order has to be looked at within the four corners of the Act and its

amendments. In the instant application, the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner

does not submit that the findings of the 1st Respondent that damages have been caused

to the 7th added Respondents furniture is against the evidence before the 1st

Respondent. In addition to that there is evidence that the 7th added Respondent has been

ejected by the Petitioner. Therefore, an Order to pay compensation for ejectment and

for the damages caused to the 7th added Respondents furniture is within the four

corners of law and not violating the provisions of section 17(1) of the Act. It would be

apparent to any fair-minded person that making an award for the ejectment and damages

caused to the furniture is just and equitable. Under the above stated circumstances,

the award of the 1st Respondent in view of the ejectment and damages caused to the

furniture could be considered as legal and should be allowed to stand. Therefore, the

Petitioner is not entitled writs as prayed for in the Petition dated 09.07.2019.

3 (1967) 69 N.L.R. 289. 4 78 NLR 46. 5 62 NLR 233. 6 (1963) 64 N.L.R. 152.

Accordingly, the Application is dismissed. The Petitioner should pay Rs.50,000/= to

the 7th added Respondent as costs of this Application.

Application dismissed.
