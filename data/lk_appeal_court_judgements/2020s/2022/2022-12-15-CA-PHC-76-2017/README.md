This is an appeal against the order dated 27.06.2017, delivered by the learned

High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the Southern Province holden

in Balapitiya which acted in revision and affirmed the vehicle confiscation order

dated 08.12.2015, delivered by the learned Magistrate of Balapitiya under the

Forest Conservation Ordinance. The respondent-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the appellant) has preferred this instant appeal to this Court in

order to have both the orders set aside, and thereby to disallow the confiscation

of the vehicle bearing registration no. 43-1188 (hereinafter the vehicle).

The following are the facts of the case. The accused was charged in the Magistrate

Court of Balapitiya for the offence of transporting Jack and Mahagoni timber

worth Rs. 63812.32 without obtaining a valid permit from the authorized body,

thereby contravening Sections 51(1)(a), 49(b), and 23 (2)(b) read with Section

25(2) of the Forest Conservation Ordinance as amended by laws, inter alia, Act

no.65 of 2009 (hereinafter the Act). The accused pleaded guilty to the charge and

CA-PHC-76-2017 Page 4 of 8 15/12/2022 IJ-60-22

the Magistrate convicted the accused on 27.12.2013, upon which the accused

was imposed a fine of Rs. 35, 000/- with a default sentence of 3 months. The

conviction of the accused ensued the confiscation of the vehicle in relation to the

offence which was released temporarily to its registered owner, the appellant, on

the same day on a bond and the learned Magistrate fixed the vehicle inquiry for

08.12.2015. After an inquiry into the matters of the complicity of the vehicle in

question and whether the petitioner has taken sufficient precautionary measures

to prevent such an offence, the Magistrate set out the order dated 08.12.2015 to

confiscate the vehicle. Aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner filed for revision

in the High Court of Balapitiya. Consequently, the learned High Court Judge

issued notices on the respondents and a stay order against the impugned order

dated 08.12.2015 of the Magistrate Court. Thereby, the vehicle in question was

released to the appellant for the second time.

However, subsequently at the final determination at the conclusion of the inquiry,

the revision application was dismissed by the learned High Court Judge in his

final order dated 27.06.2017 and affirmed the confiscation order of the learned

Magistrate.

Hence, the appellant has preferred the instant appeal to the Court of Appeal,

seeking to set aside the impugned Order dated 27.06.2017 of the High Court of

Balapitiya.

The appellant has averred, inter alia, the following as grounds for appeal before

this Court:

1. The learned trial judge has failed to consider that a proper inquiry had

not been conducted by the Magistrate Court as an inquiry has been

recommenced and withdrawn subsequently on 17.11.2015.

2. The learned trial judge has not considered the exceptional

circumstances of the revision application.

3. The learned trial judge has failed to consider the proviso to Section 40

(b) of the Act.

CA-PHC-76-2017 Page 5 of 8 15/12/2022 IJ-60-22

Counsel for the appellant in the course of oral submissions further stressed the

application of Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC). However, this

Court is of the observation that, by virtue of Section 439 of the CPC-

Any court may at any stage of an inquiry, trial, or other proceeding under

this Code summon any person as a witness or examine any person in

attendance though not summoned as a witness or recall and re- examine

any person already examined; and the court shall summon and examine or

recall and re-examine any such person if his evidence appears to it essential

to the just decision of the case.

Accordingly, the learned Magistrate has the power to recall, re-examine and to

summon any person in attendance, although not summon as a witness.

Nonetheless, the Section 439 does not grant the power to hold a re-inquiry or a

fresh inquiry. However, the learned Magistrate has authorized a fresh inquiry

by the order dated 01.09.2015, which is bad in law as it is not provided for by

Section 439.

Therefore, on 17.11.2015, the same learned Magistrate vacated his own order

dated 01.09.2015, stating that it was done per incuriam.

In the case Jayeraj Fernando Pulle Vs.Premachandra de Silva & others 1996

1 SLR 70, it was held that: However all Courts have inherent power in certain

circumstances to revise an order made by them such as

(i) An order which has not attained finality according to the law or

practice obtaining in a Court can be revoked or recalled by the

Judge or Judges who made the order, acting with discretion

exercised judicially and not capriciously

Therefore, the learned Magistrate vacated his order to hold a re-inquiry which

erred in law, and restored the previous order which was achieved through a

perusal of the evidence led before him.

Moreover, the learned Magistrate by the order dated 01.09.2015, intended to

call upon witnesses to which the petitioners counsel objected and it was upon

CA-PHC-76-2017 Page 6 of 8 15/12/2022 IJ-60-22

such refusal that the re-inquiry was ordered by the learned Magistrate. (Appeal

Brief 100 and 101 pages)

Nonetheless, the contention of the counsel of the appellant that such re-inquiry

has been subsequently withdrawn by the learned Magistrate, thereby denying

the appellant the right to a fair trial, is futile and thus does not amount to a

ground for appeal as the learned Magistrate has acted within the law provided

by Section 439.

Counsel for the appellant further states that the appellant had no knowledge of

the offence being committed by the accused and that she took all precautionary

measures as necessitated within the purview of the proviso for Article 40(1) (b) of

the Act, in order to prevent the vehicle from being employed in illegal activities.

Section 40 of the Act reads as follows:

(1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence

(a) all timber or forest produce which is not the property of the State

in respect of which such offence has been committed; and

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in

committing such offence,

shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such offence,

be confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence, is

a third party, no Order of Confiscation shall be made if such owner

proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements,

cattle and machines, as the case may be, for the commission of the

offence. (Emphasis added)

As such, the legislature has unequivocally cast a burden on the third party of

an offence within the ambit of Section 40 to dispense the burden of proving to

the satisfaction of the court that s/he, as the registered owner of the vehicle in

CA-PHC-76-2017 Page 7 of 8 15/12/2022 IJ-60-22

dispute, has taken all necessary precautionary measures to prevent the vehicle

from being employed in acts of crime.

Therefore, it is evident through the above law that the most imperative burden

cast upon a vehicle owner, who is a third party to a forest offence under the Act,

is to show cause as to why the vehicle should not be confiscated by ensuring that

s/he has taken all necessary precautions to the prevent the vehicle from being

engaged in offences. Thus, the appellants contention that she did not have

knowledge of the offence being committed is immaterial as the said burden is

properly dispensed, only when it is established that the necessary precautionary

measures have been taken by the vehicle owner, regardless of the knowledge of

the said offence.

This position is clearly analyzed in a recent case before this Court, Rajapakse

Dewage Asanga Kumara Chandrasena v Officer in Charge, Police Station,

Katugasthota and another, CA(PHC) 111/2018, Minute dated 01.11.2022,

where it was held that:

It is plainly clear in law that a claimant of a vehicle inquiry under the Forest

Ordinance has to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that he/she, having

ownership of the vehicle concerned, had taken all precautions to prevent the

use of such vehicle for the commission of the offence. By the amendment to

the Forest Ordinance in 2009 by Act No. 65 of 2009, the legislature has

determined that having no knowledge of the offence being committed is a

not good enough a reason anymore to claim a confiscated vehicle [] The

judiciary has to only discern whether the claimant being the owner of the

vehicle, had taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the

commission of the offence. This entails positive actions on the part of the

owner and not claiming mere ignorance. (Emphasis added)

This case very clearly highlights that not possessing knowledge of the vehicle

being used for illegal activities does not constitute a ground to disallow the

confiscation of a vehicle. The burden cast upon a vehicle owner requires the

owner to have taken necessary precautionary measures, to the satisfaction of the

court, to prevent the employment of ones vehicle in acts of crime. Therefore, the

CA-PHC-76-2017 Page 8 of 8 15/12/2022 IJ-60-22

contention of not possessing knowledge has no bearing in dispensing the said

burden as positive actions on the part of the vehicle owner are necessitated.

However, the appellant, despite her petition, has not taken any precautionary

measures, there is no evidence revealed in her evidence before the Magistrate

Court to affirm that the appellant had taken any measures to be precautious with

the employment of her vehicle. The mere fact that she did not possess the

knowledge of the commission of such an offence does not satisfy the said burden.

Hence this Court is of the view that the appellant has not adequately dispensed

on a balance of probability the burden cast upon her by Section 40 of the Act.

For the above reasons, it is considered the view of this Court, since the appellant

has failed to dispense the burden cast on her, that the learned Magistrate has

duly concluded the matter at hand and the learned High Court Judge has

correctly dismissed the revision application. Accordingly, we see no reason to

interfere with the order of the learned High Court Judge dated 27.06.2017 and

the confiscation order of the learned Magistrate dated 08.12.2015. Therefore, this

Court affirms the same.

The appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
