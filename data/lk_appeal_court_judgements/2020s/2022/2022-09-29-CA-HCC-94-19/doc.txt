WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Chilaw with

committing the rape of Jasintha Grace Livera on or about 30.04.2010

which is an offence punishable in terms of section 364(1) of the Penal

Code. After trial, the learned High Court Judge found the appellant

guilty and sentenced him to 19 years of rigorous imprisonment and a

fine of Rs.20,000/-, with a default term of 06 months of rigorous

imprisonment. In addition, the appellant was ordered to pay the victim

3

Rs100,000/- as compensation. This appeal is preferred against the

said conviction and sentence.

The facts of the case according to the prosecution could be briefly

summarized as follows:

At the time of the offence, the prosecutrix (PW-1) in this case was a

51-year-old woman who had been living with her daughter and son-

in-law. The prosecutrix was alone in the house on the day of the

incident because her daughter and son-in-law had gone to Bingiriya.

The appellant came to her house that day and asked for a box of

matches, which she gave him. The appellant had walked out and

returned to the house after taking the box of matches. When the

appellant returned home, he locked the door and pushed the victim

onto a mattress on the floor.

According to the prosecutrix, she resisted the accused-appellant by

shouting at him and beating him with a broomstick. However, the

accused-appellant forcibly removed her clothes, raped her, and left the

house.

Written submissions on behalf of both parties have been filed prior to

the hearing. At the hearing, the learned counsel for the appellant and

the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent made oral

submissions.

Although, several matters have been raised in the written submissions

tendered on behalf of the appellant, the learned counsel for the

appellant confined his arguments to only one ground at the hearing of

the appeal. The said ground is whether the prosecution has failed to

prove beyond reasonable doubt the ingredient of lack of consent of the

prosecutrix.

4

The accused-appellant has admitted in his dock statement that he had

sexual intercourse with the PW-1 on the day in question. However, his

position was that the sexual intercourse was done with the consent of

the PW-1. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that she

consented to the sexual intercourse after paying Rs.500/-, but then

she demanded more money, and when he did not give it, she made this

false complaint.

Accordingly, the only issue to be considered in this appeal is whether

the sexual intercourse was taken place with or without the consent of

PW-1. To substantiate the position that it was done with consent, the

learned counsel for the appellant pointed out that a complaint was

made to the police two days after the incident and the only explanation

given was that she did not have money to go to the police station.

Furthermore, the learned counsel contended that the prosecutrix and

her daughter, PW-2, took contradictory positions in describing how

PW1 disclosed this incident. The learned counsel submitted that the

prosecutrix stated that she informed her daughter about the incident

soon after she came from Bingiriya with her husband. However, the

daughter stated in her evidence that the mother informed her about

the incident when she inquired from the mother after observing few

marks on the mothers neck. The contention of the learned counsel for

the appellant was that this contradiction arose because the sexual

intercourse occurred with the consent of the PW-1 and she did not

want to tell this to her daughter until she inquired. Also, the learned

counsel contended that the position taken up in the dock statement

has been put to the PW-1 when she was cross-examined and thus

there was no reason to reject the defence version. Therefore, he urged

to acquit the appellant as the charge against the appellant has not

been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

5

The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent conceded the

fact that there is a discrepancy between PW-1s evidence and PW-2s

evidence as to whether PW-1 informed her daughter about the incident

immediately after the daughter returned home or she informed about

the incident after PW-2 inquired about it. However, the learned Deputy

Solicitor General submitted that PW-1 has clearly stated in her

evidence that the sexual intercourse was taken place without her

consent.

The aforementioned discrepancy between PW-1's evidence and her

daughter's evidence, in my view, has a direct impact on determining

whether the sexual intercourse occurred with the consent of the

prosecutrix. The prosecutrix attempted to show that she has

immediately informed her daughter about the rape when they came

home from Bingiriya. The relevant questions and answers appear as

follows:

: ?

(Page 77 of the appeal brief)

However, the daughter stated that when she noticed some marks on

her mother's neck, she inquired, and the mother then described the

incident. The following are questions posed to PW-2 and her

responses:

(Pages 103 and 104 of the appeal brief)

If the sexual intercourse was taken place with the consent of PW-1

naturally she would not disclose it to others. So, from these two

contradictory versions, if the daughters version is accepted as true,

the suspicion arises that PW1 did not inform her daughter about this

incident until the daughter inquired because the sexual intercourse

took place with the consent of PW1. However, when the daughter saw

the marks on the neck and inquired, it is obvious that she could not

tell her daughter that she had sexual intercourse with consent.

Therefore, this contradiction raises a reasonable doubt whether the

sexual intercourse occurred with the consent of the PW1. Also, if that

was the case, the credibility of PW1s testimony would also be in

question.

On the other hand, the explanation given by PW-1 for the delay in

making a complaint to the police is also not satisfactory. The incident

occurred on 30.04.2010. A complaint about the incident was made to

the Chilaw police station on 02.05.2010. However, she has stated in

the following way that she informed her neighbours about the incident

soon after it happened.

(Page 81 of the appeal brief)

Therefore, if she really wanted, she could have gone to the police

station and made a complaint with the assistance of one of the

neighbours to whom she had informed the incident.

The Judicial Medical Officer who examined the prosecutrix has given

evidence and stated that there were no external injuries. Although

there were no external injuries at the time of examining the

prosecutrix, lack of consent could not be excluded. However, the

medical evidence does not corroborate the evidence of forcible sexual

intercourse.

Apart from that, PW-1 stated that she showed her external injuries to

the doctor (page 86 of the appeal brief). However, PW-7, the Judicial

Medical Officer stated in his evidence that PW-1 did not show or

mentioned about external injuries (page 117 of the appeal brief).

Again, PW-1s evidence is contradictory to the Judicial Medical

Officers evidence.

The court can act on the uncorroborated testimony of a prosecutrix if

her evidence appears to the Court to be completely satisfactory and

there are attending circumstances that make it safe for the Court to

act upon her evidence without corroboration, as decided in the Court

of Appeal case No.129/2002, Decided on 28th June 2007. In the case

at hand, the prosecutrixs evidence has been contradicted by other

evidence as mentioned above and thus, it is unsafe to act on that

evidence.

When considering the appellants unsworn statement from the dock,

it appears that he has maintained the same position from the

beginning of the case. At the end of the cross-examination, defence

version has been suggested to the prosecutrix. The appellant stated in

8

his dock statement that she consented to the sexual act after giving

Rs.500/-. However, he stated that thereafter she asked for another

Rs.500/-. In cross-examining the PW-1 also, it was suggested on

behalf of the appellant that she was given Rs.500/- but she asked for

more money from the appellant to consume liquor. The daughter of

the prosecutrix admitted in her evidence that her mother was addicted

to consuming liquor at the time of the incident. Under such

circumstances, there was no reason to reject the defence version.

As stated previously, the only issue in this appeal is whether the

sexual intercourse occurred with or without the consent of the PW-1.

The main ingredient required to prove the charge of rape is also lack

of consent. If the sexual intercourse occurred with the consent of PW1,

the charge brought against the appellant fails.

It was held in the case of P.P. Jinadasa V. The Attorney General

C.A.167/ 2009, Decided on 21.11.2011, if the dock statement raises

a reasonable doubt in the mind of the Court about the prosecution

case, defence must succeed. Considering the aforesaid circumstances

in this case, it appears that the defence version of having sexual

intercourse with the consent of the PW1 as described by the appellant

in his dock statement as well as suggested to PW1 during her cross-

examination is plausible. Hence, the defence version raises reasonable

doubt about the prosecution case. In addition, as a result of the

contradictions that arose between the prosecutrix's evidence and her

daughters evidence as well as the prosecutrixs evidence and the

Judicial Medical Officers evidence, the doubt on the PW1s evidence

regarding lack of consent becomes more intense. In these

circumstances, I hold that the charge of rape has not been proved

beyond a reasonable doubt because the ingredient of lack of consent

of the prosecutrix has not been established beyond a reasonable

doubt.

Accordingly, the conviction and the sentence dated 28.02.2019 are set

aside and the accused-appellant is acquitted of the charge against

him.

The appeal is allowed.
