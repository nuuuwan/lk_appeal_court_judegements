MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant matter has been filed to set aside the order of the High Court

of Colombo dated 01/04/2021.

The 31st suspect respondent in this matter, (hereinafter referred to as the

suspect) had been enlarged on bail by the High Court considering the fact

that in the B report filed against the suspect ,had not contained any

incriminating evidence against him. The AttorneyGeneral has filed the

instant application to revise the said order.

According to the Attorney General, the instant matter pertains to a raid

conducted by the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) with the assistance of

the Sri Lankan Navy. The PNB had received information, a person

operating from Dubai was to send some narcotics on a vessel and a Sri

Lankan team to receive the said narcotics and distribute the same within

the country. A confidential B report has been filed before the Magistrate

on 03/02/2020. The Sri Lankan Navy had detected the said vessel and

Page 4 of 6

had arrested 10 people on the vessel with narcotics in hand. Thereafter,

three more suspects have been arrested from Sri Lankan shores by the

PNB Officers on 29/02/2020. Thereafter, further investigations have

been done and instant suspect had been taken into custody upon

surrendering himself on 05/03/2020 to the PNB Officers and produced

before the Magistrate. But the said B report does not carry any

independent evidence against him other than the material in his

statement which is inadmissible under the Evidence Ordinance and the

narration by the PNB officers of the raid.

The counsel appearing for the Attorney general stated that, under the

circumstances upon which the instant rade has been carried out, it is not

practical to be divulging all information in a B report. But, this Court

draws its attention to Section 115(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code,

according to which the Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station or the

inquirer shall forth with forward the suspect to the

Magistratetogether with a summary of the statement if any made by

each of the witnesses examined in the course of such investigation

related to the case. Therefore, the Section is very clear to say that, the

Magistrate has to have material before him when a suspect is produced

before him. Section 115(2) further says very clearly that, the Magistrate

before whom a suspect is produced under this Section, if he is satisfied

that it is expedient to detain the suspect in custody therefore, the

law is very clear that the Magistrate should be furnished with the

evidence recorded against the suspect who is being produced before

him. Therefore, the investigating officers must submit a summary of the

statements recorded if any for the Magistrate to ascertain any reason if

any, to remand the suspect. This same issue has been discussed by this

Page 5 of 6

Court in the case of CPA/63/21 and this Court has disregarded the

contention of the petitioner of the impracticality of furnishing all details

against the suspect in a B report in a raid of this nature. This Court has

noted with disapproval in the said judgment stating that there is no

provision in law which says that the relevant provisions of law can be

ignored when the situation demands and if that is so investigations

could be carried out according to the vim and fancies of any persons.

In the case of SC SPI 1-199-200-206, Sumanadasa and 205 others v

Attorney General, Sarath Silva C.J declared "Every person held in

custody, detained or otherwise deprived of personal liberty shall be

brought before the judge of the nearest competent court according to

procedure established by law, and shall not be further held in custody,

detained or deprived of personal liberty except upon and in terms of

the order of such judge made in accordance with procedure established

by law." Furthermore, his Lordship elaborated stating The procedure

established by law in respect of the right referred to above in (i) (the

right to be brought up before the judge of the nearest competent court

according to the procedure established by law) is contained in Sections

115 and 116 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. It is not in dispute

that this procedure has been complied with and that the petitioners

have been produced before the judge of the nearest competent court.

Additionally, the honorable C.J claimed, In Section 115(1) which covers

situations where the person is produced in court the reference is to a

"suspect".

In the Indian case of Joginder Kumar v State of U.P. (1994) 4 SCC 260:

1994 SCC (Cri) 1172 Anand, J., considered the dynamics of misuse of

Page 6 of 6

police power of arrest and declared (SCC p. 267, para 20) No arrest can

be made because it is lawful for the police officer to do so. The

existence of the power to arrest is one thing. The justification for the

exercise of it is quite another. No arrest should be made without a

reasonable satisfaction reached after some investigation as to the

genuineness and bona fides of a complaint and a reasonable belief both

as to the person's complicity and even so as to the need to effect arrest.

Denying a person of his liberty is a serious matter.

Therefore, in the instant matter, this Court observes that the B Report

filed against the suspect in the instant matter is only a narration of the

raid carried out by the Investigating Officers plus the summary of the

statements of the suspects which is not admissible under the Evidence

Ordinance.

Therefore, this Court sees no illegality which shocks the conscious of this

Court in the impugned order of the Learned High Court Judge dated

01/04/2021 in which he has very strenuously considered Section 115(1)

of the CCPA.

Therefore, this Court sees no reason to set aside the order of the learned

High Court Judge, as such the instant application for revision is dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
