The Learned High Court Judge has not directed the sentences to run concurrently. Therefore, it could be considered to run consecutively. The accused-appellant preferred this appeal against the said conviction and sentence.

When this appeal was taken up for argument the learned counsel for the accused-appellant informs court that his client is not challenging the conviction. The accused-appellants is challenging only the sentence.

The learned counsel who appeared for the accused-appellant informed the court that he is 63 years of age and was not having any previous convictions. He is a father of 2 children. Therefore, requested from the court to impose 10 years of rigorous imprisonment on each count to run concurrently.

It was decided in MOHD. Akhtar Hussain Alias Ibrahim Ahmed Bhatti Vs. Assistant Collector of Customs (Prevention) Ahmedabad & ORS (date of judgment 31.08.1988) 1988 AIR 2143, 1988 SCC (4) 183, 1988 SCALE (2)552, 1988 SCR Supl. (2) 747 and JT 1988 (3) 586, as follows;

HELD: 1. Section 427, Cr. P.C. relates to the administration of criminal justice and provides the procedure for sentencing. The basic rule of thumb over the years has been the so-called single transaction rule for concurrent sentences. If a given transaction constitutes two offences under two enactments generally, it is wrong to have consecutive sentences. It is proper and legitimate to have concurrent sentences. But this rule has no application if the transaction relating to offences are not the same or the facts constituting the two offences are quite different. In the present case, the three offences were committed under the same transaction and therefore the accused-appellant should be given 10 years rigorous imprisonment to run concurrently.

The learned SSC appearing on behalf of the respondent informs the court that he has no objections to the application of the accused-appellant, to impose 10 years of rigorous imprisonment to run concurrently.

Considering the circumstances of the case we decide to impose 10 years rigorous imprisonment for each count to run concurrently with effect from 08.11.2018. The rest of the sentence will remain the same.

The registrar of this court is being directed to inform the prison authorities about this judgement and the original case record should be sent to the High Court of Chilaw along with a copy of this judgement forthwith.
