Menaka Wijesundera, J. The instant matter has been filed to obtain bail for Muthuthanthrige Ranil Prasanna

Muthuthanthri under the Provisions of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and

Witnesses Act. The allegation against the suspect is that he has threatened the father of a

victim in a gang rape case. The suspect had gone to the Bakamuna Police on 12.08.2021, for

another matter thereafter he had been detained for the instant matter and since then he had

been in remand. The State Counsel appearing in this matter vehemently objected for bail being

granted in the instant matter stating that there are no exceptional circumstances.

The State Counsel appearing for the Attorney General stated that the IB Extracts have not been

received and in the substantive matter the suspects have been enlarged on bail. The Counsel

for the Suspect-Petitioner stated that although the suspects in the substantive matter have

been enlarged on bail there had been no violation of the bail conditions in the substantive

matter.

This Court observes that the instant act has been inacted to safeguard the rights of witnesses

and victims. But at the same time it is stated in the same act very clearly that precedence

should be given for matters which have been instituted under the Provisions of this Act. But in

the instant matter although the suspect has been in remand since 12.08.2021 at least the IB

Extracts have not been submitted to the Attorney General. Therefore, there is no definite date

of any judicial proceedings being instituted against the suspect. As such we consider these to

be exceptional and decide to enlarge the suspect above named on the following conditions of

bail:-

1. Rs. 50,000/- cash bail.

2. Two sureties to the value of Rs. 100,000/- each.

3. The suspect to report to the relevant Police Station on every last Sunday of the month.

4. The suspect is severely warned not to interfere with the victim or the victims family in

the substantive matter, if it is reported the instant order for bail would be cancelled.

3

As such the instant application is allowed and the Registrar of this Court is directed to

inform the Registrar of the Magistrate Court of Higurakgoda of the current order.
