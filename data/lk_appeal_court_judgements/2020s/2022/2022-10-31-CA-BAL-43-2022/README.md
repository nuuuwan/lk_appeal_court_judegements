This is an application for bail filed under Section 15B of the Prevention of

Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979 (hereinafter PTA), as

amended by the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions)

(Amendment) Act, No. 12 of 2022 (hereinafter Amendment Act, No. 12 of

2022) by the petitioner, on behalf of the suspect who is detained at the

Counter Terrorism Investigation Division Kirulapone.

The facts of the case briefly are as follows. The suspect, Mohamed

Ansardeen Ahamed Athhar, submitted to be an online freelance seller of

imported products, was arrested at his residence on 01.05.2019 by a team

of Police officers from the Welamboda Police headed by the 1st Respondent,

allegedly without indicating the reason(s) for arrest. The suspects personal

effects i.e. laptops, mobiles, hard drives, pen drives etc. that were in his

possession have also been taken into the custody of the Police.

Thereafter, the suspect has been produced before the Magistrates Court

of Gampola under Case No. B/432/19 on 02.05.2019 under Section 9A (1)

Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979, as

amended, and the provisions of the Penal Code, Explosives Act, No. 21of

1956 and Offensive Weapons Act, No. 18 of 1966. In these proceedings the

main charge against the suspect has been that he is connected with the

Islamic National Thauheed Jamath Organization and aided and abetted

terrorist activities.

The suspect has thereafter been transferred from the Welamboda Police to

Pallekale Dumbara Remand Prison on the order of the learned Magistrate

of Gampola on 22.07.2019. He has then been moved again from Pallekale

to the Counter-Terrorism & Investigation Division (CTID), Kirulapone on

07.02.2022 to be detained for further investigations under the charge of

the 3rd respondent. On 19.04.2022, the suspect has been produced before

the Magistrates Court of Colombo under Case No. B/69003/08/2022. The

CTID has reported to the learned Magistrate that the suspect was inter

alia, an activist of National Thauheed Jamath and aided and abetted the

CA-BAL- 43-2022 Page 4 of 6 13/10/2022 IJ-49-22

Easter Sunday bomb attacks, possessed 9 mm hand bullets, associated

with people who were suspects for defacing Buddha statues, and attended

lectures and weapons training by Mohamed Zaharan.

The petitioner states that despite the above allegations, incarcerating the

suspect for more than three years from when he was arrested in

01.05.2019, and subjecting the suspect to continuous investigations and

interrogations, the suspect has not been indicted in any High Court and

no trial has commenced against him. Thus, the petitioner prays to have

the suspect enlarged on bail under Section 15B of the PTA.

Having thus set out the relevant facts of the case, this Court will now turn

to the law. The applicable law is contained in Section 15B of the PTA, as

amended by the Amendment Act, No. 12 of 2022. Section 15B stipulates

the following:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the provisions of this

Act, if the trial against a person remanded or detained under this

Act has not commenced after the expiration of twelve months, from

the date of arrest, the Court of Appeal may release such person on

bail, upon an application in that behalf, made by the suspect or an

Attorney- at-Law on his behalf:

Provided however, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2)

of section 15, the High Court may in exceptional circumstances

release the suspect on bail subject to such conditions as the High

Court may deem fit:

Provided further, where the trial against an accused in respect of

whom the indictment has been forwarded and filed in the High

Court, has not commenced after the expiration of twelve months

from the date of such filing, the High Court may consider to release

such person on bail, upon an application in that behalf made by the

accused or an Attorney- at-Law on his behalf.

As per Section 15B of the PTA, the legislature has recognized a period

of 12 months for the relevant authorities to carry out investigations

and build a case for the prosecution of the suspect. And at the end of

CA-BAL- 43-2022 Page 5 of 6 13/10/2022 IJ-49-22

the 12-month period, if a case with a reasonable prospect of securing

a conviction cannot be formulated, i.e., an indictment has not been

forwarded, the law prescribes that such suspect may be considered to

release on bail. It is the duty of the investigators to seek

advice/instructions from the Attorney Generals Department within

the given a 12-month period, and expedite the investigation according

to the law.

As detailed above, the suspect has been incarcerated for nearly three

years and is yet to be served with an indictment, with no indication of

the commencement of a trial. Hence, the petitioner has fulfilled the

legislative prescription envisioned by Section 15B of the PTA,

introduced by Amendment Act, No. 12 of 2022. As such, this Court is

vested with the discretion to consider the suspects bail application

and make an order. At this juncture, it is pertinent to note that the

State Counsel has not objected to the granting of bail to the suspect.

In considering all the facts detailed above, it appears to this Court that

the respondents have held the suspect in incarceration for a prolonged

time under the PTA, without building up a rational basis and any

prospect of a trial. The Court also notes the inordinate delay in the

process of administering justice, and the aggrieved state of the suspect

owing to such shortcomings.

As this Court stated in Buwaneswaran Rajeevan Vs E.M.S.

Edirisinghe O.I.C. Kodikamam Police Station BAL-20-22 CA

Minutes dated 05.10.2022 Whilst the law does not construe the

incarceration of a suspect pending investigation as amounting to

punishment, it does indeed restrict the inherent rights and freedoms of

the suspect, which are ensured by the Constitution. Hence, a suspect

has the right to be brought to trial without unreasonable and inordinate

delay, even in the context of a special circumstance envisioned under

the PTA. If adequate material to justify the continued incarceration of a

suspect is absent, such person must be discharged at the first available

opportunity.

CA-BAL- 43-2022 Page 6 of 6 13/10/2022 IJ-49-22

It is the considered opinion of this Court, the investigating officers who

have subjected the suspect to three years of incarceration and

restriction of liberty without indicting or commencing a trial against

the suspect, have failed to provide justification for the continued

incarceration of the suspect.

In view of the above, it is the considered view of this Court that the

suspect be released on bail, subject to the bail conditions set out

below.

Bail conditions

1. Cash Bail of Rs 25,000/-

2. Two sureties to the value of 100,000/- each, as acceptable to the

learned Magistrate of Gampola.

3. The suspect to report to the Police Station- Welamboda on the 4th

Sunday of every month between 9.00am 3.00 pm.

4. Passport/Travel Document if any, to be surrendered to the Magistrate

Court of Gampola.

Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this order to the Magistrate Court of Gampola/Colombo.

Bail granted.
