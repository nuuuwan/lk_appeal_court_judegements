JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo under Sections 54(A) (b) and 54(A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for

Trafficking and Possession of 3.83 grams of Heroin (diacetylmorphine) on

06th June 2014.

The prosecution had called 08 witnesses in support of their case and marked

production P1-18. When the defence was called, the Appellant had made a

dock statement and closed his case.

After the consideration of evidence presented by the prosecution and the

defence, the Learned Trial Judge found the Appellant guilty on both counts

and has sentenced him to life imprisonment on the both counts on

29/05/2020.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Counsel for the Appellant informed this Court that the Appellant had

given his consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

3 | P a g e

pandemic. Hence, argument was taken up in his absence but was connected

via Zoom platform from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. That the Learned Trial Judge failed to consider that the prosecution

version did not pass the test of probability.

2. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in both facts and law when

concluding that the prosecution proved the case beyond reasonable

doubt.

3. That the Learned Trial Judge did not evaluate the defence evidence from

the correct perspective and rejected the same in the wrong premise.

Background of the case.

On 06/06/2014 SI/Nimal Officer-in-Charge of Crime Prevention Unit of the

Galle Police Station, as usual left the police station at around 8.30 hours

with his team of five police officers to engage in Crime Prevention Duty in

Galle police area. While they were patrolling in Wakwella, Minuwangoda,

Binge Kanda,Weliwatta and Kongaha in Galle Police areas, near Weliwatte

railway gate he had met an informer who had provided a reliable information

about a person trafficking of Heroin. After getting all necessary information

about the persons description including his type of attire he had clad with,

proceeded to the location which was about 50-60 meters ahead.

At the location, which was called by Kone Gaha Handiya spotted a person

matching with the information standing behind few three-wheelers parked.

When he reached him and inquired, his suspicious conduct led to further

inquiry. When he was subjected to a body check taken to a nearby

construction site, a parcel with a brown coloured substance had been

detected from his underwear. As the substance recovered from the Appellant

reacted for Heroin, the Appellant was arrested immediately and brought to

the Galle Police Station after temporary sealing the productions at the place

4 | P a g e

of arrest. At the Galle Police Station, the substance was weighed in front of

the Appellant. The gross weight of the substance had been 17.940 grams and

same had been re-sealed and handed over to the reserve police officer PW7,

PS/1623 Dharmappriya under PR No.1069/2014 at 11.06 hours.

PW2, SI/Asanka Kumara had corroborated the evidence given by PW1 on

every aspect including on minute details put in the police Information Book.

To prove the chain of custody witnesses PW07, PW08, PW9 and PW12 and

production clerk of the Galle Magistrate Court were called.

After calling PW10, the Government Analyst, the prosecution had closed the

case. When the Learned Trial Judge had called for the defence, the Appellant

made a dock statement and closed the case for the defence.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person and this burden never

shifts. Hence an accused person has no burden to prove his case unless he

pleads a general or a special exception in the Penal Code.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are

of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions.

In the Attorney-General v. Rawther 25 NLR 385, Ennis, J. states thus: [1987} 1 SLR 155

"The evidence must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence. His innocence is presumed in law, from the start of the

case, and his guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.

5 | P a g e

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:

the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required in

a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree is

well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree of

probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond

the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it

admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the

evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility

in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence, of course it is

possible, but not in the least probable, the case is proved beyond

reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.

At the hearing the Learned Counsel for the Appellant commenced his

augment by combining the first and second grounds of appeal together. In

those grounds the Appellant contended that the Learned Trial Judge failed

to consider that the prosecution version did not pass the test of probability

and erred in both facts and law when concluding that the prosecution proved

the case beyond reasonable doubt.

In this case PW1 had vividly given evidence as to how the raid was conducted

after the information he had received while on duty. Acting on that

information, he had successfully arrested the Appellant who was totally a

stranger to him. The Learned Counsel strenuously placed his submission on

the time factor consumed for the entire raid and reporting back to the police

station.

As correctly pointed out by the Learned Deputy Solicitor General, PW1 and

PW2 had clearly explained that after the arrest of the Appellant at 9.45

hours, they returned to the station, though the exact time is not mentioned

and the time referred to as 10.45 hours is not the time, but it was the time

they entered their notes in the Information Book. The time was put as 10.45

hours includes the time they reached to the police station under the road

6 | P a g e

traffic condition, weighing and sealing the production. Hence, 10.45 hours

is not the time of return but the time the notes were entered. This position

had been very clearly explained during the trial by the witnesses. The

Learned High Court Judge had very accurately discussed and analysed the

evidence pertaining to time consumption for the entire raid and accepted the

prosecution position which clearly demonstrate that the prosecution had

passed the test of probability of the prosecution case.

The next point that the Counsel for the Appellant argued about using a

private vehicle for the raid conducted. As stated by the witnesses this is not

a case the raiding team left after an information. While they were on normal

patrol duty, they received the information which needed to be acted

immediately. This is not an unusual happening considering the nature of the

case. Further going for raid in civics also not unusual or illegal considering

the nature of the raid. Further the witnesses had put clear notes that they

were going in civil uniform and also in a private vehicle.

Bradford Smith, Law Commission, WWW.smithlitigation.com 2014 states

that:

Good police note taking is important for two reasons. First, it invariably

bolsters the credibility of the police officer giving evidence. Second, it

promotes the proper administration of criminal justice by facilitating the

proof of facts.

Hence, the Learned Counsel for the Appellant had failed to the satisfy any

merit under these appeal grounds.

In the final ground of appeal, the appellant contend that the Learned Trial

Judge did not evaluate the defence evidence from the correct perspective and

rejected the same in the wrong premise.

The Appellant in his dock statement submitted that he was wrongly joined

to this case by PW1, who is known to him also he insisted him to provide

7 | P a g e

information about two of his friends living in Maligawatte, Colombo-10. He

admits the arrest but disputes the place of arrest.

Even though the dock statement of an accused has less evidential value our

courts never hesitated to accept the same when it creates a doubt on the

prosecution case.

In Don Samantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha v. The Attorney General

CA/303/2006 decided on 11/07/2012 the court held that:

Whether the evidence of the defence or the dock statement is sufficient

to create a doubt cannot be decided in a vacuum or in isolation because

it needs to be considered in the totality of the evidence that is in the light

of the evidence for the prosecution as well as the defence.

In Kathubdeen v. Republic of Sri Lanka [1998] 3 SLR 107 the court held

that:

It is settled law that an unsworn statement must be treated as

evidence. It has also been laid down that if the unsworn statement

creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case or if it is believed,

then the accused should be given the benefit of that doubt.

In this case the Learned Trial Judge had very correctly and extensively

discussed and analysed the dock statement of the Appellant and correctly

concluded that the dock statement of the Appellant not created any doubt

against the overwhelming evidence of the prosecution. He has correctly given

reasons as to why he rejects the defence evidence. Thereby, the Learned High

Court Judge had considered all the evidence placed in its correct perspective

and arrived at the finding to convict the Appellant. Hence, this ground also

sans any merit.

In this case PW1 and PW2 are key witnesses. Their evidence is clear, cogent

and unambiguous. The court considering all other evidence presented by the

8 | P a g e

prosecution, without any hesitation relied on that evidence and convicted the

Appellant. Further their evidence has passed the probability test.

As the prosecution had proven this case beyond reasonable doubt, I affirm

the conviction and the sentence imposed by the Learned High Court Judge

of Galle dated 29/05/2020 on the Appellant. Therefore, his appeal is

dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Galle along with the original case record.
