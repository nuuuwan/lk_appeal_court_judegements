A definition given in an Act cannot be used for purposes of another Act.

However, along with the word export, the words sell, supply and distribute are also present in that Section as alternatives. Therefore, the licence issued to the Appellant cannot conclusively be considered to be a licence that permits export. Hence, I am of the view that unless the Appellant establishes on other evidence that the Appellant exports bunker fuel on that particular licence, the existence of the licence itself is insufficient to establish the said fact.",

It is obvious that a ship which leaves the territory of Sri Lanka will not stay in high seas indefinitely. It should reach a foreign port. If the same ship returns to a Sri Lankan port due to some unforeseen or catastrophic event, the supply could still be treated as an export, but not otherwise.",

In fact, the Respondent has raised this issue in their written submission filed in this Court by stating that the contracts entered into by the Appellant do not provide for a terminus outside the territorial waters of Sri Lanka17. The ship/vessel being a non-resident ship/vessel should not be the test in determining this fact, since, there may be non-resident ships, registered in a foreign country, providing services within the Sri Lankan territory. However, it is unfortunate that in the case in hand, none of these documents were produced. It appears that even the Respondent, the CGIR, has not taken any step under Section 215 of the Inland Revenue Act to search for these documents. Nevertheless, since the Appellant is claiming a tax exemption in this case, the burden lies on the Appellant to establish its eligibility for the exemption.",

Therefore, it was submitted that the Appellants sale of marine bunker fuel, a transaction in foreign currency, constitutes an export. However, in my view this may be one of several criteria which could be taken into consideration in deciding whether a transaction is an export or not but, not the decisive factor. There may be many more local transactions done in foreign currency which would not constitute an export.",
