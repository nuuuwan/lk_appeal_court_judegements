This is an appeal against the judgment of the Provincial High Court of Uva

Province holden in Monaragala in Case No. 15/2018 delivered on 20.06.2019

which affirmed in revision, an order of confiscation under the Forest Conservation

Ordinance No. 16 of 1907 as amended, delivered on 16.05.2018 by the learned

Magistrate of Wellawaya in case No. 92935. The appellant is seeking to set aside

both orders and thereby set aside the confiscation of a dozer bearing the

Registration Number UP-ZA 3885 (hereinafter referred to as the vehicle).

On 23.08.2018, the vehicle was taken into custody for committing an offence

under the Forest Conservation Ordinance. The accused pleaded guilty, and a fine

was imposed. The vehicle inquiry was held to show cause as to why the vehicle

should not be confiscated in which the appellant appeared as the claimant. After

the conclusion of submissions, the learned Magistrate ordered the vehicle to be

confiscated. Aggrieved by the said decision, the appellant filed a revision

application in the High Court, which re-affirmed the order of the learned

Magistrate.

In the appeal at hand, the learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the appellant

has relied on the following two grounds:

1. Section 20(k) of the Forest Conservation Ordinance as amended is a stand-

alone Section, hence the confiscation provisions stipulated under Section 40

does not apply to the offences under Section 20.

2. In any case, alternatively the appellant has dispensed his burden as

necessitated under Section 40.

In analysing the first ground, the attention should be drawn to the relevant provisions

in the Forest Conservation Ordinance. Firstly, Section 20 (k) of the Ordinance provides

that:

20. A person who in a forest other than a Conservation Forest, Reserved

Forest or Village Forest: -

(a)

CA-PHC-0142-19 Page 5 of 8 23/11/2022 IJ-53-22

(b)

(k) clears or breaks up soil or digs any land for cultivation or for any other

purpose or cultivates any land already cleared;

.

shall be guilty of an offence and be liable on conviction to imprisonment for

a term not exceeding two years or to a fine not less than rupees five

thousand and not exceeding rupees fifty thousand or to both such fine and

imprisonment. In addition to the above, the Court may award compensation

for any damage caused to such forest. Such compensation shall not be less

than the value of the damage caused to such forest and shall be charged

and recovered as a fine levied by Court. (Emphasis added)

Thereafter, Section 40 of the Forest Conservation Ordinance as amended by Forest

(Amendment) Act No 65 of 2009 stipulates confiscation of vehicles connected with a

forest offence as follows:

(1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence-

(a) all timber or forest produce which is not the property of the State in respect

of which such offence has been committed; and

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in committing such

offence shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such offence, be

confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles, implements

and machines used in the commission of such offence, is a third party, no Order

of Confiscation shall be made if such owner proves to the satisfaction of the

Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of such tools,

vehicles, implements, cattle and machines, as the case may be, for the

commission of the offence." (Emphasis added)

CA-PHC-0142-19 Page 6 of 8 23/11/2022 IJ-53-22

This Court has carefully considered the submissions made by the learned

Presidents Counsel for the appellant that the offence of unlawful clearing of a

forest under section 20 (k) of the Ordinance, does not come within the ambit of

section 40 of the Ordinance. At this juncture this Court would like to observe

that all offences addressed by the Ordinance qualify as forest offences, no

offences have been excluded and thereby Section 40 is applicable for offences

under the Ordinance including Section 20 (k). The language used in Section 20

and 40 is plain and clear with no ambiguity at all. In Maxwell on the

Interpretation of Statutes 11th Edition at page 28 it states that, The first and the

most elementary rule of construction is that it is to be assumed that the words and

phrases of technical legislation are used in their technical meaning if they have

acquired one, and otherwise in their ordinary meaning, and the second is that the

phrases and sentences are to be construed according to the Rules of grammar.

By the plain legislative provisions of these sections, it is apparent that there is no

requirement to interpret Sections 20 and 40 going beyond its ordinary meaning

and to arrive at a conclusion that it is a stand-alone Section. It has no ambiguity

that calls for a further legislative interpretation by this Court. Thus, the first

ground of appeal of the learned Presidents Counsel is insignificant.

As such, now I am going to consider the second argument that whether the

appellant has fulfilled the burden cast upon unequivocally by the legislature on

an owner of a vehicle under the Forest Conservation Ordinance to prove to the

satisfaction of the court that he, having ownership of the vehicle concerned, had

taken all precautions to prevent the use of such vehicle for the commission of the

offence on a balance of probability. Hence, the primary contention to be decided

by this Court is whether the learned Magistrate has correctly evaluated the

evidence placed before him when arriving at the final determination that the

appellant has failed to dispense the said burden.

Therefore, it is pertinent at this point to evaluate the facts of the case with a view

to determine whether the appellant has taken all precautions to prevent the

commission of the offence. Giving evidence before the Magistrate Court at the

vehicle inquiry, the appellant has stated that the first accused driver of the vehicle

is his own son, and that he instructed his son before handing over the vehicle to

CA-PHC-0142-19 Page 7 of 8 23/11/2022 IJ-53-22

him on this particular day, only to clear the area around the second accuseds

house and no further. He claims that his son has cleared a further area around

the house of second accused, including part of the state forest on the persistent

request of the second accused who had alleged it was to protect the property from

wild elephant attacks. Thus, the appellant claims that his son has acted in strict

contradiction to his instructions.

The appellant has thereafter visited the said location to observe the extent of the

area cleared. After observing that a section of the state forest has been cleared,

he has inquired his son as to why this was done and the son has stated that it

was on the insistence of the second accused, believing it to be a part of the second

accuseds property, and that he was unaware it was part of a state forest. It must

be noted that the appellant has claimed that there was no fence or visible

boundary separating the forest from the second accuseds property.

The appellant has stated in evidence that his son has been driving the said dozer

for over 02 years now and has never committed an offence. As the vehicle is

parked at the appellants house at all times when not in use, and as his son

resides in the same house as the appellant, he claims that he is always alert as

to how and when the vehicle is used. He questions every evening after work about

what work was undertaken each day and instructs him (Appeal Brief page 40-

43).

When considering the submissions of the appellant, this Court must determine

whether the steps taken by the petitioner satisfies the burden cast on him by the

proviso to Section 40 of the Forest Conservation Ordinance. On a perusal of the

appeal brief and the evidence presented by the appellant, it has to be determined

that the appellant has dispensed the burden of proving to the satisfaction of the

court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of the dozer for

commission of the offence. Being constantly vigilant of the whereabouts and the

use of the dozer and handing over temporary control of it only to his son, and

frequently inquiring and instructing as to the type of work undertaken, indicate

that the appellant has taken all reasonable precautions to prevent the dozer being

used for any offence.

CA-PHC-0142-19 Page 8 of 8 23/11/2022 IJ-53-22

Moreover, the undisputed evidence of the appellant brings to light that he has

not only given mere verbal instructions to the accused but has also taken many

reasonable precuationary measures to ensure the prevention of the commission

of the offence and has engaged in follow ups as to the vehicles engagement in

various excursions.

As recently held by this Court in, Dewapurage Kamal Deshapriya Vs Officer in

Charge, Police Station, Pannala and Others CA, PHC/139/2015, Minute dated

20.09.2022 Nevertheless, the Act does not mean the owner of vehicle should sit

beside the vehicle round the clock and should control the all activities of the driver.

As stated by this division in CA/PHC/203/17 CA minute dated 21.06.2022 A

vehicle owner employing a driver to carry out transportation of goods cannot

reasonably be expected to physically visit each and every site to ensure that illegal

activities are not carried out using his vehicle.

Thus, it is further buttressed that the appellants precautionary measures of

giving instructions and implementing them through regular follow ups

sufficiently dispense the burden cast upon a vehicle owner by the Forest

Conservation Ordinance.

For the above reasons, this Court sets aside the order of the learned Magistrate

Court of Wellawaya dated 16.05.2018 and order of the learned High Court Judge

dated 20.06.2019.

Appeal allowed.
