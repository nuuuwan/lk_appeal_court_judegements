This matter was taken up for support on 30.06.2022 to decide on the issuance of formal

notice of this case on the Respondents. However, both parties agreed that this matter could

be taken up for argument on the same day, after issuing formal notice, on urgent basis and

also parties agreed to proceed with the hearing of this case based on the pleadings already

filed.

The Petitioner alleges that the instant application relates to the writ application bearing

No. CA/Writ/34/2022 filed in this Court by the Petitioner (with a Co-Petitioner) against

the above-named Respondents. The Petitioner, inter alia, seeks for a writ of Certiorari

quashing every decision and/or determination of the 1st Respondent made in the Labour

Tribunal, (Colombo) inquiry bearing No. LT/13/141/2015 reflected in the order dated

04.03.2022 marked P3Y(1) and P3Y(2). The said reliefs are being sought mainly based

on the grounds emanating from the order of this Court issued on 02.03.2022 in the said

writ application No. CA/Writ/34/2022. Additionally, the Petitioner is seeking for a writ

of Certiorari quashing the decision and/or determination of the said Labour Tribunal in

the orders dated 01.11.2021, 07.12.2021 and 03.02.2022, marked P3(A), P3(B) and

P3(X) respectively.

The broader question identified by this Court in the said Writ Application No.

CA/Writ/34/2022 was whether the Labour Tribunal could issue an order to disallow a

witness who was not examined by the adverse party (cross-examination), to be summoned

again to court. The grievance of the Petitioner in the said case was that the learned

President of the Labour Tribunal failed to recognize and record that there was no cross-

examination on behalf of the 2nd Respondent in respect of the particular witness. This

Court has observed in the said order that the aforesaid question directly dealt with the

decision-making process of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal and it fell within

the jurisdiction in respect of the applications for judicial review. However, in view of

resolving the issue, the learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent undertook specifically to

get it recorded before the President of the Labour Tribunal in case no. LT/13/141/2015

that he would not cross examine the witness namely, Mr. Himal Alahakoon.

In view of the said undertaking, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal was directed

by this Court to accommodate the learned Counsel of the 2nd Respondent to perform the

said undertaking. The impugned orders marked P3(Y)(1) and P3(Y)(2) has been made

Page 3 of 8

by the 1st Respondent the President of the Labour Tribunal No. 13 (learned LT resident)

on the day that the 2nd Respondent of the instant application tendered to the Labour

Tribunal (LT) a copy of the order made by this Court in the said writ application No.

CA/Writ/34/2022 on 02.03.2022.

At the outset, I draw my attention to Section 5(1) of the Industrial Disputes (Hearing and

Determination of Proceedings) (Special Provisions) Act No. 13 of 2003. In terms of the

said Section, it shall be the duty of a Labour Tribunal to whom an application is made, to

make all such inquiries into that application and hear all such evidence as the tribunal may

consider necessary, and thereafter make such order as may appear to the tribunal to be just

and equitable. Further, such order should be made not later than four months from the

date of the making of such application.

Similar provisions are contained also in Sections 31(c)(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act.

As regards those statutory provisions, the prime duty of the Labour Tribunal is to inquire

into the applications, hear evidence and make orders within a very short period of time as

stipulated in the Statute. The parties to an application before the Labour Tribunal is also

duty bound to assist the Tribunal to conclude an inquiry expeditiously. This notion, in my

view. is very much relevant to the issues of the instant application.

Primarily, I need to observe the extent to which this Court should intervene in to the

questions in relation to the orders made by the Labour Tribunal.

The Section 7(1) of the Industrial Disputes (Hearing and Determination of Proceedings)

(Special Provisions) Act No. 13 of 2003 stipulates that;

Where an application is made to the Court of Appeal under subsection (4) of section 31D of

the Industrial Disputes Act, for the issue of an order in the nature of a writ of certiorari,

prohibition, procedendo or mandamus, against the President of a labour tribunal in respect

of an order made by such President, the Court of Appeal shall hear and decide such

application within four months of the date on which such application is made to the Court of

Appeal.

The writ court does not sit as an appellate court to scrutinize the decision of the lower

authority on merits. The writ court does not substitute its own decision for that of the

authority concerned in which the statute has vested discretion. Discretion means that more

than one choice is available to the authority. The authority has the right to choose between

Page 4 of 8

more than one possible course of action and there may be difference of opinion among

reasonable persons as to which option to follow. So, the court gives freedom of choice to

the authority having discretion. Only when the exercise of discretion is flawed by a

vitiating factor, the court would quash the decision. Judicial review is concerned with the

legality of a decision and not its merits. The courts often assert that it is not their function

as review courts to substitute their wisdom and discretion for that of the persons to whose

judgement the matter in question is entrusted by law. The principle has been stated firmly

by the House of Lords in Chief Constable of the North Wales Police vs. Evans1, that judicial

review is concerned not with the decision, as such, but with the process of decision

making. (Vide-M. P. Jain and S. N. Jain, Principles of Administrative Law, 9th Edition,

[2022], Lexis Nexis, Volume 2, at p. 2042)

Bearing in mind the above inferences in law, I now advert to examine the impugned orders

which were made by the learned LT President. The issues in relation to the application

bearing No. CA/Writ/34/2022 and in the impugned orders marked P3(Y)(1) &

P3(Y)(2) emerged after the 2nd Respondent (the Applicant in the relevant LT case)

informed the LT that the Petitioners (the Respondent in the relevant LT case) witness

namely Mr. Himal Alahakoon would not be examined (cross-examination) by the 2nd

Respondent soon after the Petitioner completed examining (examination-in-chief) its said

witness.

When a party to a matter in a court of first instance or in a tribunal declares that a witness

of the adverse party would not be cross-examined, the usual practice is to simply write

down in the case record that there is no cross-examination. Having recorded that there

would be no cross-examination, the Court or Tribunal should proceed with the next witness

or with the other steps in the case. However, on perusal of the proceedings of the LT, it is

observed that voluminous assertions and observations/orders have been made by the

respective parties and the learned LT President, instead of simply writing down-no cross-

examination.

I can recall an important paragraph in Judicial Writing - A Benchmark for the Bench

[2016], Partridge) by Chinua Asuzu, which is very much apt even for judicial writing by

Tribunals. The said paragraph reads as follows (at p.10);

1 (1982) 1 WLR 1155

Page 5 of 8

Judges, whether trial or appellate, should review their drafts to minimize, if not eliminate,

all dicta not pertinent to the outcome or not true to principle. As Mansfield CJ put it in 1772,

I care not for the supposed dicta of judges, however eminent, if they be contrary to all

principle.2 Obiter dicta can also hurt the system by being misread as part of rationes

decidendi. So judges must resist the lure of the literary or philosophical frolic. Reserve your

beloved but impertinent adages, examples, maxims, parables, poetry, quotable quotes and

stories for your forthcoming memoirs. Never mind how your decision would have read if the

facts had been different. Solve the problem before you. Avoid wondering off on hypotheticals

or addressing issues that go beyond resolving the case. Doing so will lead readers to incorrect

interpretation and unwelcome dicta3

On 04.03.2022, the learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent has categorically submitted to

LT that the said witness Mr. Himal Alahakoon would not be cross examined by the

Applicant in the said LT case. However, nowhere in the proceedings, I can find the simple

words to the effect-no cross-examination. The learned LT President has instead analyzed,

inter alia, in his order marked P3(Y)(2), upon an application by the Petitioner, the

admissibility of the evidence of the above witness in the absence of any cross-examination.

In my view, the learned LT President is not wrong in deciding at page 16 of the said

impugned order P3(Y)2 that the relevancy of evidence and admissibility of evidence

should be decided along with the final order of the case. However, the learned LT

President without pausing at that has arrived at an ambiguous conclusion that there is no

legal existence to the stand taken by the Respondent that the said witnesss evidence has

not been challenged. The learned LT President has phrased the said conclusion as follows;

.

.

The above portion, among several other, of the said order was heavily censured by the

learned Counsel for the Petitioner. Similarly, the said learned Counsel referring to the

order marked P3Y brought to the attention of this Court the observations and the

2 Sommersett vs. Stewart Case (1772) 98 ER 499: (1722) 20 State Trials 1, (Mansfield CJ) 3 Gerald Lebovits & Lucero Ramirez Hidalgo, Advice to Law Clerks: How to Draft Your First Judicial Opinion, 36 Westchester Bar Journal, No. 1, Spring/Summer 2009, 29, 32

Page 6 of 8

conclusion of the learned LT President on the matter of granting a final date for the

purpose of the Petitioners case and such portions of the said order is also being disputed.

The Petitioner is challenging the orders marked P3(A), P3(B) and P3(X). As I have

observed earlier those orders have been made on 01.11.2021, 07.12.2021 and 03.02.2022

respectively. In other words, the said orders have been made by the LT before issuing the

aforesaid order dated 02.03.2021 in the said writ application No. CA/Writ/34/2022.

Presumably, most of the issues arising out of those orders have been resolved to a greater

extent as a result of the said order made by this Court on 02.03.2022 and by subsequent

orders made by the learned LT President.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the portion of the order dated

03.02.2022 in page 13 of P3(X) by which the learned LT President implicated that there

was no requirement to follow any other principles of natural justice, is incurably defective

and cannot be allowed to stand. The learned LT President has alleged such comments in

view of the availability of the statutory provisions which requires the LT to conclude an

inquiry within 4 months. The said portion of the order is as follows;

. 4

,

.

The Petitioners main contention is that the learned LT President, as borne out in the

impugned orders P3(Y)(1), P3(Y)(2), P3(A), P3(B) & P3(X), has manifestly

surrendered his independent judgement in terms of the inquiry into the said LT case and

has predetermined the matter. Further, the Petitioner complains that the learned LT

President has failed to conduct the said inquiry in an impartial manner and denied the

Petitioner a fair hearing.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner drew the attention of this Court to the paragraphs

in page 394 of the Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth, (11th Edition) Oxford and

the paragraphs in pages 532 to 533 of De Smiths Judicial Review (6th Edition). Referring

to the conception established in those legal literature, the said learned Counsel argues that

the administrative law has developed over time such that any decision that appears to have

been predetermined, whether by the adoption of an inflexible policy or failure to make an

Page 7 of 8

independent judgement, should be struck down in judicial review. The said proposition in

my view falls within the activist model in administrative law which was generally

espoused by persuasive judges such as Lord Denning as opposed to the restrain model.

On principle, I agree with the submissions of the learned Counsel on the legal aspect of

predetermination. Anyhow, my considered view based on the circumstances of this case

is that I should not use my discretionary power in favour of the Petitioner in this instance.

I have arrived at the said conclusion on this point because I am not convinced with the

propriety of the motive of the learned LT President in respect of the events of

predeterminations that are highlighted by the Petitioner on the part of the learned LT

President.

On a careful examination of the impugned orders, I take the view that those orders are

more vulnerable to be challenged in a Court which exercises the appellate or revisionary

jurisdiction than in a writ court. Moreover, I make an observation that the

predeterminations, if any, made by the learned LT President can eventually be challenged

in such an appeal or revision at an appropriate stage of the case.

An application for judicial review against an order of the Labour Tribunal should be

examined in the context of the legal position discussed at the beginning of this judgement.

A writ court does not usually issue a writ merely on the basis that the decision of the lower

court or tribunal is wrong or erroneous and accordingly, this court cannot examine the

correctness of the impugned decisions. In the circumstances, I am of the view that no

mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari could be issued against the learned LT

President as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition.

The assertions of the Petitioner on bias against the learned LT President cannot simply be

unaddressed as I consider it as an allegation of serious nature against a judicial officer.

Two different types of bias can be identified as (i) actual or (ii) apprehended. The actual

bias requires proof that a decision-maker in fact approached the issues with a closed mind

or had prejudged. (See-Minister for Immigration and Multicultural affairs vs. Jia Legeng

(2001) HCA 17; (2001) 205 CLR 507). Apprehended bias requires reconsideration of

whether, in all the circumstances, a fair-minded lay observer with knowledge of the

objective facts might entertain in a reasonable apprehension that the judge might not bring

an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question. (Vide-Webb and

Hay vs. R (1994) HCA 30; (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 67).

Page 8 of 8

Although, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner made submissions on bias against the

learned LT President, what was actually averred in the Petition by the Petitioner is that

those impugned orders had given rise to both reasonable suspicion of bias and a real

likelihood of bias on the part of the said learned LT President. I am of the view that the

allegation of judicial bias should be inextricably entwined with the facts and the

circumstances upon which such allegations are being raised. Based on the special

circumstances of this case and in light of my above findings on issuance of a writ against

the decisions of the LT, I should exercise my discretion not to make a determination on

the allegations of bias against the said learned LT President.

However, I make an observation that parties are entitled to expect that their dispute will

be heard by a fair and an independent court or tribunal. The court/tribunal should be

impartial such that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly

be seen to be done. When there are reasonable charges against a judge on bias and unfair

trial, the respective judge is free to get himself recused from hearing the case with a good

grace, based on his own opinion. Anyhow, it seems to be that the Petitioner has not

directly raised any objection before the learned LT President upon bias on the part of the

said President.

For the reasons set forth above, I do not proceed to grant reliefs as prayed for in the prayer

of the Petition of the Petitioner. Application is dismissed.
