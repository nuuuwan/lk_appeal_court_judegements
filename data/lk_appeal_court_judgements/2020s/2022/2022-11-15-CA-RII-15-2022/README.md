B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Defendant-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) raised a preliminary objection as to the jurisdiction of this Court to hear

and determine the application of the Plaintiff-Respondent-Petitioner (hereinafter referred

to as the Petitioner). As this is a threshold issue pertaining to jurisdiction, we heard the

parties oral submissions and directed them to file written submissions on this point of

law. This Order deals with the merits of the preliminary objection.

In the instant application, dated 4th May 2022, made under Article 138 of the

Constitution for restitutio-in- integrum and/or revision, the Petitioner is seeking to revise

and set aside the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal holden at Negombo dated

21st March 2022 (X21); to affirm the judgment of the District Court of Negombo dated

19th January 2021 (X8) or in the alternative to order a trial-de-novo allowing parties to

raise the actual point of contest arising out of the dispute.

The facts in brief, as narrated in the Petition, are as follows. The Petitioner was

formerly married to the Respondent. Prior to their nuptials, they jointly purchased a land,

Page 4 of 18

by Deeds of Transfer Nos. 852 and 922 (dated, respectively, 26th August 1998 and 17th

December 1998). Following the dissolution of their marriage, they sought to partition the

land. The District Court of Negombo decreed to partition the land in equal shares to both

parties. The Respondent- husband, appealed to the High Court of Civil Appeal holden at

Negombo, and by judgment dated 21st March 2022 the learned High Court Judges set

aside the judgment of the District Court. It was concluded that the Petitioner-wife holds

her share of the land on a Constructive Trust in favour of the Respondent- husband (while

the Respondent was absolutely entitled to the remaining share of the land) as the

attendant circumstances signified that the Respondent-husband did not intend to dispose

of the beneficial interest in the land to the Petitioner-wife when the said Deeds of Transfer

were executed. The Petitioners grievance is that this judgment (X21) is erroneous in

fact and law as it has not appreciated certain material particulars.

The Respondent raised a preliminary objection disputing the jurisdiction of this Court

to revise and set aside the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal (hereinafter also

referred to as High Court of the Provinces or Provincial High Court) and to grant

restitution as prayed for by the Petitioner. The objection is that this Court has no

revisionary or restitutionary jurisdiction in respect of judgments and orders of the High

Court of the Provinces exercising civil appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of

the judgments and orders of the District Courts. Section 5C(1) of the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990, as amended by the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 54 of 2006, provides for a specific

right of appeal for those aggrieved by the judgments and orders of the High Court of the

Provinces exercising civil appellate and revisionary jurisdiction. This Section reads:

(1) An appeal shall lie directly to the Supreme Court from any judgment, decree or order

pronounced or entered by a High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution in the

exercise of its jurisdiction granted by Section 5A of this Act, with the leave of the Supreme

Court first had and obtained. The leave requested for shall be granted by the Supreme Court,

where in its opinion the matter involves a substantial question of law or is a matter fit for

review by such Court.

The Petitioner did not avail herself of the right of appeal granted by the aforesaid

Act, within the prescribed time. The reason for not doing so as averred by the Petitioner

in paragraph 14 of the Petition is that considering the special circumstances of the case

the Petitioner was advised and then opted to invoke this Courts revisionary and/or

Page 5 of 18

restitutionary jurisdiction to restore the status of the parties giving due consideration to

the pertinent fact that the said partition action was contested between ex-husband and

ex-wife to the property jointly owned during the marriage.

The Respondent contends that by permitting this application:

a. The legislative intention in establishing the High Court of the Provinces by the

Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the enactment of the High Court

of the Provinces Acts will be defeated.

b. The floodgates will be opened for litigants who have failed or neglected to exercise

their right of appeal under Section 5C and for litigants who may use this

opportunity as a delaying machination.

Before delving into the jurisdictional objection, we are of the view that the

floodgate argument is not defensible. To this end, we would like to quote a statement of

his Lordship Ananda Coomaraswamy J. in Abeywardene v. Ajith De Silva [1998] 1 SLR

134 which met this argument head-on:

At the outset I must say that these three decisions are right and that if in consequence of

these decisions there would be an undesirable increase of litigation, that is the matter for the

legislature.

We will now address the jurisdictional objection.

Although not cited to us, the objections that the Respondent raised were succinctly

dealt with by his Lordship Mahinda Samayawardhena J. in Rizleigh Bertram Grand v.

Portia Kekulwala CA/RI/06/2016 decided on 24.06.2019, in which his Lordship laid out

those concerns. The following excerpt (on page 6) is relevant to the instant application:

.But the argument of the learned counsel seems to be that, nevertheless, a party

can come before this Court against the Judgment or Order of the High Court of Civil Appeal by

way of revision and/or restitutio in integrum in terms of Article 138 of the Constitution.

If that argument is accepted, section 5C becomes meaningless, and the intention of the

legislature will blatantly be defeated, as any party dissatisfied with any Judgment or Order of the

High Court of Civil Appeal can come before this Court by way of revision and/or restitutio in

integrum. Then the party dissatisfied with the Judgment or Order of the District Court will have

three appealsfirst to the High Court of Civil Appeal, second to the Court of Appeal, and third to

Page 6 of 18

the Supreme Court. That was obviously never the intention of the legislature. One of the main

objectives of setting up High Courts of Civil Appeal is to curb laws delays in civil litigation and not

to expand it.

(A view espoused by his Lordship in an earlier decision as well. Vide CA/RI/15/2018

decided on 02.11.2018.)

His Lordship cited the case of Stephan Gunaratne v. Thushara Indika Sampath

CA/PHC/APN/54/2013 decided on 23.09.2013. In that case, his Lordship A.W.A. Salam J.

(with his Lordship Sunil Rajapaksha J. agreeing) concluded that a litigant is not entitled

to maintain a revision application in the Court of Appeal to revise a judgment of the High

Court of the Provinces in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. In arriving at this

conclusion their Lordships held:

Appreciably, Section 5A of Act No 54 of 2006 quite specifically states that all relevant

written laws applicable to an appeal, in the Court of Appeal are applicable to the High Court as

well. This undoubtedly demonstrates beyond any iota of doubt that the scheme provided by Act No

54 of 2006 to facilitate an appeal being heard by the Provincial High Court is nothing but a clear

transfer of jurisdiction and in effect could be said that as far as appeals are concerned both the

High Court and the Court of Appeal rank equally and are placed on par with each other. Arising

from this statement of law, it must be understood that if the Court of Appeal cannot act in revision

in respect of a judgment it pronounces in a civil appeal, then it cannot sit in revision over a

judgment entered by the High Court in the exercise of its civil appellate jurisdiction as well, for

both courts are to be equally ranked when they exercise civil appellate jurisdiction. [emphasis

added]

His Lordship Samayawardhena J. applying the reasoning in Stephan Gunaratne,

which dealt with this Courts revisionary jurisdiction in respect of the judgments and

orders of the High Court of the Provinces in the exercise of its civil appellate jurisdiction,

went further by observing that this Court cannot exercise its restitutionary jurisdiction

in respect of judgments and orders of the High Court of the Provinces in the exercise of

its civil appellate jurisdiction.

Page 7 of 18

Therefore, the question that we are faced with is whether this Court can exercise

its revisionary or restitutionary jurisdiction in respect of judgments and orders of the

High Court of the Provinces in the exercise of its civil appellate jurisdiction.

Availability of Revision

When the High Court of the Provinces was created by the Thirteenth Amendment

to the Constitution, Article 154P of the Constitution set out the jurisdiction of those

Courts. Article 154P (3) which dealt with civil and criminal jurisdiction reads:

(3) Every such High Court shall

(a) exercise according to law, the original criminal jurisdiction of the High Court of Sri Lanka in

respect of offences committed within the Province;

(b) notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any law, exercise, appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction in respect of convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by

Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within the Province;

(c) exercise such other jurisdiction and powers as Parliament may, by law, provide.

The High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 was

enacted to make provisions regarding the procedure to be followed and the right to appeal

to, and from the High Courts established under Article 154P of the Constitution. (Vide

S.C.(SD) Nos. 07/2018 to 13/2018 Special Determination of the Supreme Court on the

Judicature (Amendment) Bill) It is seen that the said Act, as it was originally enacted,

provided for appeals from a Provincial High Court to the Court of Appeal or Supreme

Court, depending on the jurisdiction which it exercised. If the Provincial High Court was

exercising its jurisdiction under Article 154P(3)(b) appeal lied to the Supreme Court. If

the Provincial High Court was exercising its jurisdiction under Article 154P(3)(a) an

appeal lied to the Court of Appeal. However, those procedures dealt with criminal cases.

It was by an amendment to the 1990 Act (the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 54 of 2006) that Sections 5A to 5D were inserted.

Sections 5A, and 5B provide for the hearing of appeals from the District Court and Family

Courts, and Section 5C provides for an appeal to the Supreme Court from the decision of

the Provincial High Court. This, as held in the aforementioned Special Determination of

Page 8 of 18

the Supreme Court, conferred additional jurisdiction on the High Court of Provinces

under Article 154P(3)(C).

Therefore, we will first examine the approach that our Courts have adopted when

the Court of Appeal exercises revisionary jurisdiction in respect of judgments and orders

of the High Court of the Provinces in the exercise of its criminal appellate or revisionary

jurisdiction.

The High Court of the Provinces shall have and exercise appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction in respect of convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by the

Magistrates Courts and the Primary Courts within the province (Vide Article 154P(3)(b)

of the Constitution). In terms of Section 9 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990, as amended, any person aggrieved by a final order,

judgment, decree or sentence of a High Court established under Article 154P of the

Constitution in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction vested in it by paragraph (3)(b)

of Article 154P of the Constitution can appeal to the Supreme Court with leave

obtained. The cursus curiae as derived from a host of judgments examining the relevant

statutory provisions are as follows:

- If the High Court of the Province is exercising an appellate jurisdiction in respect

of convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by the Magistrates Courts

and the Primary Courts within the province a direct appeal lies to the Supreme

Court. (Vide Muththusamy Balaganeshan v OIC, Seeduwa SC.SPL/LA 79/2015

decided on 01.04.2016)

- If the High Court of the Province is exercising its appellate jurisdiction in respect

of convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by the Magistrates Courts

and the Primary Courts within the province a litigant may file a revision

application in the Court of Appeal (Vide Wijesiri Gunawardane & Others v.

Chradsena Muthukumarana & Others, Jayarathna v. OIC, Mount Lavinia &

Others, Dr. Ama Weeratunga v. Sepala Ekanayake & Others SC Appeal Nos. 111,

113, 114 /2015 decided on 27.05.2020) - provided there are exceptional

circumstances.

Page 9 of 18

- If the High Court of the Province is exercising its revisionary jurisdiction in respect

of convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by the Magistrates Courts

and the Primary Courts within the province an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal

(Abeywardene v. Ajith De Silva (supra))

Thus, when one examines the criminal context, the Supreme Court has jurisdiction

when the Provincial High Court exercises appellate jurisdiction but not when the

Provincial High Court exercises its revisionary jurisdiction. In the latter scenario, an

appeal lies to the Court of Appeal. For example, presently, when the Provincial High

Court exercises its revisionary jurisdiction in a Section 66 application or State Land

Recovery matter, an appeal is made to the Court of Appeal.

In respect of the High Court of the Provinces civil appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction, the statutory provisions are different. Article 154P(3)(c) of the Constitution

provides that the High Court of the Province shall, exercise such other jurisdiction and

powers as Parliament may, by law, provide. Such law includes Section 5A of the High

Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990, as amended by the High

Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 54 of 2006. Section 5A(1)

provides that a High Court of the Province established by Article 154P of the Constitution

shall have and exercise appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of judgments,

decrees and orders delivered and made by any District Court or a Family Court within

such Province and the appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in

law, which shall be committed by any such District Court or Family Court, as the case

maybe. Section 5C(1) provides that an appeal shall lie directly to the Supreme Court

from any judgment, decree or order pronounced or entered by a High Court established

by Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of its jurisdiction granted by Section

5A of this Act, with leave of the Supreme Court first had and obtained.

The words in the exercise of its jurisdiction will logically mean in the exercise of

its appellate and revisionary jurisdiction as set out in Section 5A(1). If that is so, then

two matters can be clarified at ease. Those are,

- If the High Court of the Province is exercising an appellate jurisdiction in respect

of judgments, decrees and orders delivered and made by any District Court or a

Family Court within such Province a direct appeal lies to the Supreme Court, and

Page 10 of 18

- If the High Court of the Province is exercising its revisionary jurisdiction in respect

of judgments, decrees and orders delivered and made by any District Court or a

Family Court within such Province an appeal lies to the Supreme Court.

However, if the High Court of the Province is exercising its appellate jurisdiction

in respect of judgments, decrees and orders delivered and made by any District Court or

a Family Court within such Province can a litigant file a revision application in the Court

of Appeal, against a judgment or order of the High Court of the Provinces? This is a

question that arises in the instant case.

His Lordship Salam J. in Stephan Gunaratne (supra) reasoned that the relevant

statutory provisions have transferred jurisdiction that was previously exercised by the

Court of Appeal and thereby since both Courts rank equally the Court of Appeal cannot

act in revision when the High Court of the Provinces exercises civil appellate jurisdiction

as the Court of Appeal cannot act in revision of its own judgment pronounced in a civil

appeal.

His Lordship Nawaz J. in Seylan Bank PLC v. Christobel Daniels CA PHC APN

58/2014 decided on 14.12.2016 observed (albeit in the context of Section 31DD of the

Industrial Disputes Act by which a direct appeal lies to the Supreme Court from a final

Order of the High Court in the exercise of its appellate or revisionary jurisdiction in

relation to an order of a Labour Tribunal):

The invocation of the revisionary jurisdiction in these circumstances would be tantamount

to indirectly maintain an appeal to this court (an appeal notwithstanding lapse of time) when the

sole and exclusive appellate jurisdiction from High Court Labour Appeals is vested in the Supreme

Court. Such an exercise of jurisdiction by this Court will also be contrary to Article 138 of the

Constitution.

Additionally, his Lordship reasoned:

The structure of Article 138 would also prevent this Court exercising revisionary

jurisdiction when the sole and exclusive jurisdiction has been vested in the Supreme Court. It is

crystal clear beyond any scintilla of doubt that the revisionary power of this Court lies only against

orders made by such High Court, Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution when they

have taken cognizance of causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things. The words "such

Page 11 of 18

High Court, Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution" must be read ejusdem generis

and such collocation of words read together with the words causes, suits, actions, prosecutions,

matters and things clearly indicates that these Courts exercise original jurisdiction. Only when

the High Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution has exercised original jurisdiction,

revision lies to this court. In other words only when the High Court has exercised original

jurisdiction, the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court can be invoked. In my view Article 138

intentionally suggests such a deliberate intendment of Parliament and when the High Court has

sat in its appellate jurisdiction as has happened in this case, no revision lies to this Court.

Respectfully, we are unable to agree with the proposition that this Court is

forbidden from exercising its revisionary jurisdiction in respect of judgments and orders

of the Provincial High Court exercising civil appellate jurisdiction. The main reason is

that fundamentally an appeal is distinct from revision. That distinction has not been

appreciated.

This distinction has been made abundantly clear in the following judgments of the

Supreme Court, which have illustratively laid out previous judgments that recognised the

same distinction.

Her Ladyship Shirani Bandaranayake J. (as she then was) in Wickramasekera v.

Officer- In-Charge, Police Station Ampara [2004] 1 SLR 257 held:

Unlike an appeal which could be made by any party who is dissatisfied with any judgment,

decree or order pronounced in a Lower Court except when such right is expressly disallowed, the

power in revision is an extra ordinary power which is quite distinct from the appellate jurisdiction.

[emphasis added]

Her Ladyship cited the celebrated passage from the judgment of his Lordship

Sansoni C.J. in Mariam Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed 68 NLR 36:

The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite independent of and distinct

from the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. Its object is the due administration of justice and the

correction of errors, sometimes committed by the Court itself, in order to avoid miscarriages of

justice. It is exercised in some cases by a Judge of his own motion, when an aggrieved person who

may not be a party to the action brings to his notice the fact that unless the power is exercised

injustice will result.

Page 12 of 18

His Lordship Priyantha Jayawardena P.C. J. in Lakshman Ravendra Watawala

v. Chandana Karunathilake SC Appeal 31/2009 decided on 06.07.2018 observed that:

it is evident that in appropriate instances, the Court has entertained Revision

Applications when there was no right to appeal.

In Wijesiri Gunawardane (supra) his Lordship Aluwihare P.C. J. observed:

..the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is a Constitutional mandate which,

undoubtedly is subject to the provision of statutory law. Nevertheless, owing to its genesis in the

Constitution, any restriction or modification which the Legislature seeks to introduce must be

introduced by way of express wording

This is particularly because the revisionary jurisdiction, unlike the appellate jurisdiction,

does not depend on a parallel statutory right. It is well established in our law that an appellant

cannot prefer an appeal against an order, judgment or sentence unless there is a right created by

statute. As Justice Jameel stated in Martin v. Wijewardena (1989) 2 SLR 409, at page 419, Article

138 is only an enabling Article and it confers the jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals to the

Court of Appeal. The right to avail of or to take advantage of the jurisdiction is governed by several

statutory provisions in various legislative enactments. An appeal could only result pursuant to

the intersection of a forum jurisdiction and right of appeal.

In contrast, the Revisionary Jurisdiction is a remedy which lies at the discretion of the

court. It does not require a concomitant right in this regard. There only needs to be provision

conferring the forum jurisdiction. Revision is a discretionary remedy; it is not available as of right.

When there is a right of appeal available, this Court must be cautious only to

exercise its revisionary jurisdiction when there are exceptional circumstances. These

are circumstances that shock the conscience of the court. The very high threshold an

applicant must satisfy itself evinces the fact that an applicant is not welcomed in this

Court with open arms, as if the applicant is entitled as of right to file the revision

application. Quite the contrast to when an applicant exercises a right to appeal, in which

case there is no exceptional circumstances threshold to cross. In the absence of such

circumstances, this Court cannot exercise its revisionary jurisdiction. This is because the

existence of revision is not a statutory creation, unlike a right to appeal.

If revision applications are permitted when there is no right of appeal granted by

statute, they must then logically be accepted when there is a right of appeal as well. This

Page 13 of 18

is because revision has no concomitant statutory right. This would result in a situation

that would be interpreted by some to mean an opening of a floodgate of endless litigation.

In Abeywardene v. Ajith de Silva (supra) his Lordship Ananda Coomaraswamy J. set out

the position thus:

If a litigant invokes the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, he has one chance

for an appeal to the Supreme Court, whereas if he invokes the revisionary jurisdiction of the High

Court he will have two chances of appeal, one to the Court of Appeal and then to the Supreme

Court, except when the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court is invoked in relation to an order

of a Labour Tribunal, in which case there is only one appeal and that too to the Supreme Court

only.

The supposed unfairness that may be occasioned to a litigant (as observed by his

Lordship Salam J.) who has opted to file a direct appeal in the Supreme Court (with no

prospect of an appeal thereafter), in contrast to a litigant who opts to file a revision

application (with a prospect of an appeal to the Supreme Court or a second bite of the

cherry as his Lordship held), cannot disenfranchise a litigant who opts to do the same.

This choice of procedure is created as a result of an absence of express exclusion of the

revisionary jurisdiction of this Court. It is not for us to deprive a litigant of that choice

that the Legislature has not expressly excluded. To do so, would be to blur the distinction

between appeal and review to a vanishing point.

Thereby, this cannot amount to a usurpation of the exclusive jurisdiction conferred

on the Supreme Court, as wiping out revisionary jurisdiction must be done so by express

provision of law. As his Lordship Soza J. in Somawathie v. Madawela [1983] 2 SLR 15 at

29 stated, Nothing less than an express removal of these powers would be required to

achieve such a result.

Further, we are unable to agree with the reasoning of his Lordship Nawaz J. that

revision exists only when the Provincial High Court exercises original jurisdiction. We are

mindful that Article 138 as amended by the Thirteenth Amendment, includes errors

committed by the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction. As

the language is plain and clear and does not lead to absurdity, there is no other rule of

interpretation but the literal rule that must be followed as, for example, espoused by his

Page 14 of 18

Lordship Priyantha Jayawardena P.C. J. in Lakshman Ravendra Watawala v. Chandana

Karunathilake (supra).

The Constitution appears to confer further jurisdiction by including the words in

the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction instead of only original jurisdiction. On that

basis, the Court of Appeals revisionary jurisdiction is expanded to include revisionary

jurisdiction when the Provincial High Court exercises civil appellate jurisdiction. The

insertion of the words such High Court will include the Provincial High Court exercising

its appellate or original jurisdiction, as mentioned in the earlier part of the Article, and

not merely only an original jurisdiction.

Article 138 before and after the Amendment (without the proviso) are juxtaposed

for the purpose of convenience:

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise

subject to the provisions of the Constitution

or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the

correction of all errors in fact or in law which

shall be committed by any Court of First

Instance, tribunal or other institution and

sole and exclusive cognizance, by way of

appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum of

all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions,

matters and things of which such Court of

First Instance, tribunal or other institution

may have taken cognizance.

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise

subject to the provisions of the Constitution

or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the

correction of all errors in fact or in law which

shall be committed by the High Court, in the

exercise of its appellate or original

jurisdiction or by any Court of First Instance,

tribunal or other institution and sole and

exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal,

revision and restitutio in integrum, of all

causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters

and things of which such High Court, Court

of First Instance tribunal or other institution

may have taken cognizance. [emphasis

added]

Thus, an expansion of this Courts revisionary jurisdiction, in the light of the

creation of the Provincial High Courts with appellate and revisionary jurisdiction appears

to be envisaged.

Page 15 of 18

We are of the view that this Court can entertain a revision application when the

Provincial High Court is exercising civil appellate jurisdiction, provided that exceptional

circumstances have been made out. We adopt the reasoning of the Supreme Court in

Wijesiri Gunawardane (supra):

Thus, it is clear that the existence of right of appeal does not uniformly and blanketly

result in undermining the revisionary jurisdiction. The right of appeal, is no doubt, a determining

factor which the Court takes into account when considering a revisionary application. However,

having recourse to an appeal does not ipso facto act as an ouster of the revisionary jurisdiction. On

the contrary, it is the Courts prerogative to decide, at its discretion, to refuse a revisionary

application where it appears that the existence of a parallel right of appeal does not give rise to an

exceptional circumstance. Thus, where these jurisdictions are separate but complementary to each

other, a negation or the express provision of right of appeal does not result in ousting the

revisionary jurisdiction.

In Rasheed Ali v. Mohamed Ali [1981] 1 SLR 262 his Lordship Wanasundera J.

opined:

the powers of revision vested in the Court of Appeal are very wide and the Court can in

a fit case exercise that power whether or not an appeal lies. When, however, the law does not give

a right of appeal and makes the order final, the Court of Appeal may nevertheless exercise its

powers of revision, but it should do so only in exceptional circumstance. Ordinarily the Court will

not interfere by way of review, particularly when the law has expressly given an aggrieved party

an alternate remedy such as the right to file a separate action, except when non-interference will

cause a denial of justice or irremediable harm. [emphasis added]

Availability of Restitution

The remedy of restitutio-in-integrum is an exceptional one conferred on this Court

by virtue of Article 138 of the Constitution. Despite the creation of the High Court of the

Provinces, it appears that the restitutionary jurisdiction of this Court remains exclusively

within the province or domain of the Court of Appeal. (Vide Sajith Dilhan v. Victor [2012]

2 SLR 286). A view recently affirmed by his Lordship Dr. Ruwan Fernando J. in CA RII

0003 2016 decided on 23.06.2020:

The Petitioner has not made any application to the High Court of Civil Appeal against the

order made by the District Court refusing to entertain her application. Even if she had failed to

make any application to the High Court of Civil Appeal, it does not prevent her from coming before

Page 16 of 18

this Court by way of restitutio in integrum as this Court has sole and exclusive jurisdiction to

entertain an application by way of restitutio in integrum in terms of Article 138 of the

Constitution. [emphasis added]

The minority view in Ama Weeratunga v. OIC Talangama CA (PHC) APN No.

204/2006 decided 02.09.2014 is also pertinent. On appeal, the Supreme Court (in Wijesiri

Gunawardane (supra)) reached the same conclusion as the minority view. Although the

Supreme Court did not allude to the following observation made by his Lordship K.T.

Chitrasiri J. in the minority judgment, the observation is relevant for the present

purposes:

However the Parliament has thought it fit not to grant the power to have and maintain

the applications in the nature of restitutio in integrum to such High Courts exercising civil

appellate powers though the very purpose of filing an application of restitutio in integrum also is

to review decisions made by District Courts. The said power to entertain restitutio in integrum

applications still remains with the Court of Appeal despite the power to review decisions by way

of an appeal and a revision is given to another forum.

For this reason, the above judicial dicta espousing the view that this Court cannot

entertain a restitution application in respect of judgments and orders of the High Court

of the Province exercising civil appellate jurisdiction must be distinguished. There is no

express legislative provision that confers parallel exercise of restitutio-in-integrum on the

High Court of the Provinces. Although Section 5D (2) of the Act provides for the President

of this Court, in consultation with the Chief Justice, to issue directions pertaining to

appeals, applications in revision, and restiutio in integrum pending in the Court of Appeal

to be removed for hearing to appropriate High Court, Section 5A has only conferred

appellate and revisionary jurisdiction on the High Court of the Provinces.

In addition to this, the Constitutional Articles itself, especially Article 154P, has

not conferred the power to exercise restitution, although it has enabled the exercise of

revisionary jurisdiction.

The term revisionary cannot be taken to encompass restitution. Revision and

restitution are distinct, just as an appeal is distinct from both revision and restitution. In

Sri Lanka Insurance Corp v. Shanmugam [1995] 1 SLR 55, his Lordship Ranaraja J. held:

Page 17 of 18

The power of restitution differs from revisionary power of this court in that the latter is

exercised where the legality or propriety of any order or proceedings of a lower court is questioned.

Restitution reinstates a party to his original legal condition which he has been deprived of by the

operation of law. Thus, it follows, the remedy can be availed of only by one who is actually a party

to the legal proceeding in respect of which restitution is desired.

An appeal, in contrast, to use the words of her Ladyship Shiranee Tilakawardane

J. in Abeynayake v. Richard Pathirana [2003] 1 SLR 362, (albeit in relation to the

distinction between appeal and judicial review):

An appeal deals inter alia with the merits of the proceedings appealed against.

Thus, respectfully we are unable to agree with the dicta of his Lordship

Samayawardhena J. in Rizleigh Bertram Grand v. Portia Kekulwala (Supra) and

CA/RI/15/2018 (supra) in so far as it holds that this Court is deprived of exercising its

restitutionary jurisdiction over judgments or orders of the High Court of the Provinces

exercising appellate jurisdiction in respect of judgments and orders of the District Court.

A caveat that is worth reiterating is that found in the judgment of his Lordship

Nawaz J. in Rajapakse Mudiyanselage Karunaratne v. Iluktenna Arachchilage Piyasena

CA Case No. 02/2016 decided on 23.05.2017. That is when the Supreme Court has acted

in its jurisdiction touching upon an issue and if a Petitioner seeks to revive and revisit

that issue in this Court, this Court cannot usurp a jurisdiction which it does not have, in

the guise of restitutio in integrum. This is because the Supreme Court is the highest and

final superior Court of record.

We are of the view that when a High Court of the Provinces exercises appellate

jurisdiction in respect of judgments, decrees, and orders delivered and made by any

District Court or a Family Court within such Province, this Court continues to exercise

its restitutionary jurisdiction, provided that the grounds for invoking the same have been

made out to Court and that the Petitioner is not disentitled from claiming the relief.

The allegation that an interpretation such as this would result in a multiplicity of

proceedings and thus contribute to the laws delays, as alluded to above, is not novel. It

Page 18 of 18

has been flatly rejected by the Supreme Court in Gunaratne v. Thambinayagam [1993] 2

SLR 355. Their Lordships of the Supreme Court observed: If the multiplicity of litigation

in this sphere is felt to be an anomaly, it is a matter for the legislature.

For those reasons, we overrule the objection.
