That is to decide what sentence is to be imposed on the accused who has been convicted. In doing so he has to consider the point of view of the accused on the one hand and the interest of society on the other. In doing so the Judge must necessarily consider the nature of the offence committed, the manner in which it has been committed the machinations and the manipulations resorted to by the accused to commit the offence, the effect of committing such a crime in so far as the institution or organization in respect of which it has been committed, the persons who are affected by such crime, the ingenuity with which it has been committed and the involvement of others in committing the crime. The Trial Judge who has the sole discretion in imposing a sentence which is appropriate having regard to the criteria set out above should in our view not to surrender this sacred right and duty to any other person, be it counsel or accused or any other person. Further he went on to state that whilst plea bargaining is permissible in our view, sentence bargaining should not be encouraged at all and must be frowned upon. It is safe to say that this view still remains as a fundamental aspect of this court and sentence bargaining is still something that is to be frowned upon.",
