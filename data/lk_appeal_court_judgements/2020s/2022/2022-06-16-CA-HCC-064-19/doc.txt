WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Rathnapura

on the charge that he committed the offence of murder on or about the

05th of April 2012, by causing the death of the deceased Denika

Samanthie, an offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal

Code. After the trial, the learned High Court Judge convicted the

appellant and imposed the death sentence. This appeal is preferred

against the said conviction and sentence.

Written submissions on behalf of both parties have been filed prior to

the hearing. At the hearing, the learned counsel for the appellant and

the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent made oral

submissions.

The learned counsel for the appellant conceded the fact that the

prosecution has a strong case. He also admitted that the evidence of

the prosecution witnesses was not challenged in cross-examination.

However, the learned counsel pointed out the relevant items of

circumstantial evidence and invited this court to see whether that

circumstantial evidence is sufficient to prove the charge beyond a

reasonable doubt.

The accused- appellant in this case was a barber who operated a salon

near the shop of PW 3. PW3 was the father of the deceased. The

appellant was on rent in the salon where PW 3 was his landlord. The

deceased was also operating a communication center near the salon of

the accused-appellant. It was revealed that the appellant made several

attempts to start an illicit affair with the deceased. The deceased, her

husband, and her father had lodged several complaints with the police

against the accused-appellant and the appellant had left the salon

about eight months prior to the incident because of the said

complaints.

On the day of this ill-fated incident, the deceased was at her residence

with two of her children, one being PW 1, Widanage Pubudu Prasanna

who was the eight-year-old second child of the deceased. On the day

in question, he had not attended school and was at home with his

mother since he was unwell. On that day, the husband of the deceased

had left to work. When Pubudu wanted to go to the toilet around 10.00

a.m., he saw the appellant hiding under a bed in a room in their house.

He informed the deceased about this, but she directed Pubudu to

proceed to the toilet. During the time that Pubudu was in the toilet,

the murder took place. Accordingly, Pubudu or any other person did

not witness the deceased being attacked and murdered. However,

Pubudu saw the appellant leaving the scene with a sword and the

deceased with bleeding injuries when he came out of the toilet after

two to three minutes.

4

In the circumstances, there are no eyewitnesses in this case. The

prosecution case is based on circumstantial evidence. Therefore, first

I consider the relevant legal position in determining a case on

circumstantial evidence. There is a long line of judicial authorities that

explain how a criminal charge has to be proved on circumstantial

evidence.

In the case of King Vs. Abeywickrama - 44 NLR 254 and in Junaiden

Mohomed Haaris Vs. Hon. Attorney General - SC Appeal 118/17,

decided 09.11.2017, it was held that It was incumbent on the

prosecution to establish that the circumstances the prosecution relied

on, are consistent only with the guilt of the accused-appellant and not

with any other hypothesis.

In King Vs. Appuhamy 46 NLR 128, it was held that In order to justify

the inference of guilt from purely circumstantial evidence, the

inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the

accused and incapable of explaining upon any other reasonable

hypothesis than that of his guilt.

It was also held in the case of Podisingho Vs. King 53 NLR 49 that

In a case of circumstantial evidence, it is the duty of the trial judge to

tell the Jury that such evidence must be totally inconsistent with the

innocence of the accused and must only be consistent with his guilt.

In Don Sunny Vs. Attorney General (Amarapala murder case) (1998)

2 Sri L.R. 1 it was held that when a charge is sought to be proved by

circumstantial evidence, the proved items of circumstantial evidence

when taken together must irresistibly point towards the only inference

that the accused committed the offence. On a consideration of all the

evidence, the only inference that can be arrived at should be consistent

with the guilt of the accused only. It was held further in the said case

that the prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused

5

had the opportunity of committing the offence, the accused can be found

guilty only and only if the proved items of circumstantial evidence is

consistent with their guilt and inconsistent with their innocence.

Hence, it is settled law that the prosecution must prove beyond a

reasonable doubt that no one else other than the accused had the

opportunity of committing the offence, and the circumstantial evidence

adduced in the case must be totally inconsistent with the innocence of

the accused and must only be consistent with his guilt.

According to the Judicial Medical Officer who performed the autopsy,

the cause of death was multiple cut injuries to the face, neck, and arm

involving bones. Examining the sword marked P1, the doctor

expressed his opinion that those injuries could be caused by a sword

of that nature. When Pubudu was giving evidence, he was shown the

sword marked P1 and he stated that the appellant, whom he called

Shantha mama possessed this kind of sword when he saw the

appellant leaving the place.

Undisputedly, all these parties were known to each other. Even in

cross-examination, the said fact was not disputed. Therefore, the

identification of the appellant by PW1, Pubudu is unchallenged and

could be accepted without any reasonable doubt. It is to be noted the

fact that PW 1 saw the appellant leaving the place of the incident with

a sword was also not challenged in cross-examination. In addition,

PW1 stated that apart from the appellant, nobody else was there at the

time of the incident. (This item of evidence is found on page 57 of the

appeal brief) Therefore, it is apparent that the injuries that led to the

death of the deceased were caused within the very short time that

PW 1 went to the toilet. Just before going to the toilet, PW 1 saw the

appellant under a bed in a room of their house. When PW 1 came out

of the toilet after two-three minutes, he saw the appellant leaving the

place with a sword. The Judicial Medical Officer testified that the

6

injuries of the deceased could be caused by a sword like P1. Taking

into account the evidence that there was no one else in that place, the

injuries of the deceased could have been caused by a sword like P1,

and the appellant left the place with a sword like P1 soon after the

murder, the only conclusion that could be reached is that the accused-

appellant and no one else committed the murder.

The other circumstantial evidence that comes from the other witnesses

strengthens the aforesaid inference. PW 2 was a three-wheeler driver.

In his vehicle, the appellant arrived at the scene and also left after the

incident. He stated that the appellant carried an object covered with a

newspaper. He explained further, that the object that was in the hand

of the appellant was about one and a half feet long. It is to be noted

that when PW 1 identified the sword marked P1, he showed the length

of the sword as two to three feet.

In addition, the most important piece of evidence elicited from PW 2 is

the confession made by the appellant to PW 2 about the murder, on

his return journey. PW 2 stated in his evidence that the appellant had

worn a long trousers and when the appellant got into the three-

wheeler, he saw mud on the appellants hands and knees. According

to PW 2, a person who was called Rupe or Bhanu was also in the

three-wheeler at that time. PW 2 stated that when he drove the three-

wheeler, Shantha (appellant) showed his hands to Rupe and said,

There is blood on my hands.( .

Page 94 of the appeal brief)

Not only that, the appellant had told the PW2 that he killed the

daughter of Piyasena according to the evidence given by the PW2 in

the High Court. The said item of evidence, found on page 95 of the

appeal brief, appears as follows.

Piyasena is the third prosecution witness in this case, and he has

stated that the deceased was his elder daughter.

The aforesaid item of evidence precisely shows that the accused-

appellant himself has confessed that he killed the deceased. When

cross-examining PW 2, it was brought to the notice of the court as an

omission that PW 2 had not stated in his police statement that the

appellant had told him that he killed the deceased. The learned High

Court Judge has perused the witnesss statement in the police

information book to ascertain whether there is in fact an omission. The

learned counsel for the appellant contended that the learned High

Court Judge perused the police statement and held that the said

omission does not go to the root of the case, but an omission of this

nature should be adduced to greater importance as this evidence of

the witness suggests the fact that he is trying to implicate the

appellant. In addition, the learned counsel for the appellant invited

this court to consider whether it is proper to peruse the statement of

the witness to come to a conclusion about this omission.

The aforesaid confession of the appellant is a very important piece of

evidence in adjudicating this case. If the witness said what had not

been told by the appellant, it can be inferred that the witness tried to

falsely implicate the appellant. However, if what the witness said is

true, this is very strong evidence against the appellant. Therefore, the

learned High Court Judge has very correctly ascertained whether there

was in fact an omission or not before coming to a conclusion on the

omission. However, it is equally vital to examine whether the trial judge

8

is entitled to peruse the statement of the witness in an instance like

this. In the case of King V. Cooray 28 NLR 74, the accused were

charged with the murder of an Inspector of Police. At the trial the

Presiding Judge, at the instance of the jury, called a witness, who, it

was alleged, had heard the accused call to a police constable, traveling

in a passing 'bus, to the following effect: " There, your Inspector is killed."

When the witness denied that he heard such a statement, the Judge

read out the statement made by him and recorded in the Police

Information Book.

It was held that the statement did not amount to a confession within the

meaning of section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance and a Court is

entitled to use the information book to assist it in elucidating

points which appear to require clearing up find are material for

the purpose of doing justice (Queen Empress v. Manu

(supra)). (Emphasis added)

In addition, in the case of K. B. Muttu Banda V. The Queen 73 NLR

8, it was held that where, in a statement made by a witness to a police

officer in the course of an investigation under Chapter 12 of the Criminal

Procedure Code, the witness omitted to mention a material fact narrated

by him in evidence subsequently at the trial, the statement to the police

as recorded in the Information Book may be utilised by the Court under

section 122 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code to aid it at the trial in

order to discredit the witness.

The following observations were also made in the said case: The failure

of the witnesses to mention in their Police statements that the deceased

handed the gun to Indranee before he was attacked is an omission on

a vital part of the transaction. In Queen v. Raymon Fernando [ (1962) 66

N. L. R. 1] it was held that an omission to mention in a statement a

relevant fact narrated by the witnesses in evidence subsequently, does

not fall within the ambit of the expression "former statement" in Section

155 of the Evidence Act. How then could this vital matter be brought to

9

the notice of the jury? Under Section 122 (3) of the Criminal

Procedure Code, it is the Court that has overall control over the

statements recorded in the course of a Police investigation and

the Court has a right to utilise the statements to aid it at the

inquiry or trial. We are therefore, with all respect, not inclined

to adopt the decision in the case of Raymon Fernando. The proper

approach to the cross-examination of witnesses from the statements

recorded in the course of a Police investigation is found in the

observations of Garvin A.C.J. in the Divisional Bench case of King v.

Cooray [ (1926) 28 N. L. R. 74 at 83. ] (Emphasis added)

Consequently, the Court of Criminal Appeal did not follow the decision

of Queen v. Raymon Fernando and the decision of King v. Cooray was

followed. Accordingly, it was held that the trial judge is entitled to

peruse the statements recorded in the course of the police

investigations in order to properly adjudicate the case.

The aforesaid judicial authority refers to section 122(3) of the old

Criminal Procedure Code. Sections 110(3) and 110(4) of the present

Code of Criminal Procedure Act contain comparable provisions to

those found in Section 122(3) of the Old Criminal Procedure Code. The

relevant sections of the old Criminal Procedure Code and the present

Code of Criminal Procedure Act are reproduced here for convenience.

Section 122(3) 0f the Old Criminal Procedure Code

122(3) than to prove that a witness made a different statement at a different time, or

to refresh the memory of the person recording it. But any criminal court may send for

the statements recorded in a case under inquiry or trial in such court and may use

such statements or information, not as evidence in the case, but to aid it in such inquiry

or trial. Neither the accused nor his agents shall be entitled to call for such statements,

nor shall he or they be entitled to see them merely because they are referred to by the

court; but if they are used by the police officer or inquirer who made them to refresh

his memory, or if the court uses them for the purpose of contradicting such police officer

or inquirer, the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance, section 161 or section 145, as

the case may be, shall apply.

Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to apply to any statement falling

within the provisions of section 32 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance, or to prevent such

statement being used as evidence in a charge under section 180 of the Penal Code.

except for the purpose of corroborating the testimony of such person in court:

Provided that a statement made by an accused person in the course of any

investigation shall only be used to prove that he made a different statement at a

inquiry or trial in such court and may use such statements or information, not as

evidence in the case, but to aid it in such inquiry or trial. Save as otherwise provided

for in section 444 neither the accused nor his agents shall be entitled to call for such

statements, nor shall he or they be entitled to see them merely because they are

referred to by the court but if they are used by the police officer or inquirer or witness

who made them to refresh his memory, or if the court uses them for the purpose of

contradicting such police officer or inquirer or witness the provisions of the Evidence

Ordinance, section 161 or section 145, as the case may be, shall apply :

It is to be noted that the learned High Court Judge has specifically

stated in his judgment that he perused the police statement for the

sole purpose of ascertaining whether there was in fact an omission. It

is apparent from the decisions of the aforesaid judicial authorities that

the law permits the trial judge to peruse a statement of a witness to

ascertain whether an omission brought to the notice of the court is in

fact an omission.

11

Furthermore, I am of the view that perusing the statement of the

witness in this instance is important and worthwhile to come to a fair

decision in this case. After perusing the police statement, the learned

High Court Judge found that PW 2 stated in his police statement that

the accused-appellant had told him that .

Therefore, the learned judge correctly found that PW2 had not falsely

implicated the appellant, but this slight difference occurred since he

gave evidence after four years of the incident. That is why the learned

High Court Judge was of the view that the said omission does not go

to the root of the case. I am also of the view that the learned Judge has

carefully considered the omission brought to the notice and has come

to a correct conclusion that the omission does not go to the root of the

case because the appellant went away with a sword in his hand from

the place where the Piyasenas daughter was murdered, , got into the

PW2s three-wheeler and confessed . If the

appellant said that or , both

statements suggest without any doubt that he spoke about the killing

of the deceased.

PW 4 was a person who was trained in hair cutting under the

appellant. When he was having his lunch on the day in question, the

three-wheeler in which the appellant was going had stopped. So, PW 4

invited the appellant to have lunch. When having the lunch, according

to the evidence of the PW4, the appellant had told him

. In cross-examination, the said piece of evidence has also not

been challenged. Further, PW 4 stated in his evidence that the

appellant told him one day that he would kill Piyasenas daughter.

Although a suggestion has been made in cross-examination that the

said fact of killing Piyasenas daughter was not stated in the police

statement, no such omission was brought to the notice of the court in

that respect. Hence, PW 4s that piece of evidence has also not been

challenged in an acceptable manner.

12

PW 3, Piyasena, who is the father of the deceased, stated in his

evidence that the appellant tried to have an illicit affair with his

daughter and several complaints were made to the police by him, her

daughter, and the husband of his daughter. In that way, PW 3

explained the possible motive for the appellant to commit the murder.

It is to be noted that when the opportunity was given to cross-examine

this witness, no single question was asked on behalf of the appellant,

and thus his evidence has also never been challenged.

As explained previously and admitted by the learned counsel for the

appellant, the evidence of the other prosecution witnesses was also

unchallenged. The Indian judgment of Sarvan Singh v. State of Punjab

(2002 AIR SC (iii) 3652) pages 3655 and 3656, was cited in the case of

Ratnayake Mudiyanselage Premachandra v. The Hon. Attorney

General C.A Case No. 79/2011, decided on 04.04.2017 as follows:

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined

to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross-examination,

it must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be

accepted.

In the case of Himachal Pradesh v. Thakur Dass (1983) 2 Cri. L. J.

1694 at 1701 V.D Misra CJ held that whenever a statement of fact

made by a witness is not challenged in cross-examination, it has to be

concluded that the fact in question is not disputed. Similarly in Motilal

v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1990) Criminal Law Journal NOC 125 MP

it was held that Absence of cross-examination of prosecution witness

of certain facts, leads to inference of admission of that fact.

The learned High Court Judge has evaluated the evidence of all

prosecution witnesses and stated reasons in the judgment, how this

evidence of prosecution witnesses corroborates each other and how the

circumstantial evidence of the case draws the only inference of the guilt

13

of the accused-appellant. The appellant has just denied his

involvement in the offence in his short four-line dock statement.

Therefore, it is obvious that no reasonable doubt is created on the

strong prosecution case as a result of the dock statement, which

cannot be believed.

In summarizing the aforesaid circumstantial evidence; PW 1 had seen

the appellant in their house under a bed when he was going to the

toilet. After two to three minutes, PW 1 saw his mother (deceased) with

bleeding injuries and the appellant leaving the place with a sword.

Thereafter, when the appellant was going in PW 2s three-wheeler, PW2

saw the appellant carrying an object covered with a newspaper. The

appellant confessed to PW 2 about the murder. Several complaints

made by the deceased, the husband of the deceased, and the father of

the deceased, and also the threat made by the appellant to kill the

deceased, as stated by PW 4, demonstrate the motive behind the crime,

although the prosecution has no liability to establish the motive to

commit the murder. There is no iota of evidence regarding the

involvement of a third person in the murder. The PW 1 specifically

stated that there was no any other person at the place of the incident

when the incident took place.

Taking the entirety of the aforesaid evidence, it is apparent that the

evidence, in this case, is consistent only with the guilt of the appellant

and not with any other hypothesis of his innocence. Also, the only

inference that can be arrived at is consistent with the guilt of the

accused-appellant only, and it is apparent from the aforesaid evidence

that no one else other than the appellant had the opportunity of

committing the murder. Accordingly, I hold that the learned High

Court Judge is correct in convicting the appellant for the offence of

murder.

14

Accordingly, the judgment dated 13.12.2018, the conviction, and the

sentence are affirmed.

The appeal is dismissed.
