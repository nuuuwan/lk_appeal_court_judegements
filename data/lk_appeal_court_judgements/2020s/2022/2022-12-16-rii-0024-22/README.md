JUDGMENT

The instant application of the Petitioner (SPS Marine (Pvt) Ltd) made in terms of

Article 138 of the Constitution seeks to invoke this Courts revisionary and/or restitutionary

jurisdiction to set aside or revise the Order of the learned Judge of the High Court of Colombo,

exercising its admiralty jurisdiction, in Case bearing No. REM 1/20 dated 24th November

Page 5 of 8

2022 (Z1), in which the learned Judge had allowed the Vessel to be sold to a bidder who bid

at a lesser value than the appraised value; and to direct the learned Judge to direct a fresh

auction be conducted of the Vessel MV Sai Arambh and/ or to allow the Petitioner or its

nominee to purchase the Vessel at a sum of United States Dollars Eight Hundred and Fifty

Thousand.

The facts of the case, in brief, are as follows.

An action was filed by the 1st to 19th Respondents, the master and crew of the Vessel

MV Sai Arambh, in the High Court of Colombo to arrest the said Vessel for unpaid wages

and other claims. The Vessel was arrested on the 29th of January 2020. The Petitioner sought

to intervene by Petition dated 6th February 2020, which was allowed. The 1st to 19th

Respondents sought for the Vessel to be appraised and for it to be sold by way of public

auction. The Petitioner objected to the same. The learned High Court Judge by Order dated

3rd December 2021 ordered appraisement to be carried out. The Vessel was appraised at a

sum of United States Dollars One Million Two Hundred and Twenty Four Thousand Three

Hundred and Fifty Five, by an independent expert (X6). The learned Judge by Order dated

2nd March 2022 ordered the Vessel to be auctioned.

Against this Order the Petitioner filed a leave to appeal application (bearing No.

LTA/004/22) before this Court to set aside the same (That is to quash the Order of the learned

Judge ordering an auction to be conducted). On the 4th of April 2022 (Y3), this Court

permitted for the said auction to be postponed subject to the Petitioner abiding by the

conditions laid out therein, as this Court was informed that the Petitioner was willing to

furnish a Bank Guarantee to secure the 1st to 19th Respondents claim, and the expenses of

the Marshal and Ports Authority. These Conditions as set out in the Order (Y3) are as

follows:

1. Parties will have to take another valuation of the Vessel by an independent valuer who should

be nominated by the Marshal, Plaintiff-Respondents [1st to 19th Respondents] and the 2nd

Defendant-Petitioner [the Petitioner] to be tendered to the Admiralty Court within one week

from today, on or before 10th of April 2022.

Page 6 of 8

2. The 2nd Defendant-Petitioner should undertake to the necessary repairs of the impugned

Vessel such as water leakages and other repairs immediately under the direction and

supervision of the Marshal.

3. The 2nd Defendant Petitioner should submit an insurance policy of USD 50 Million on or before

10th of April 2022 as a cover to compensate for the damage and salvage operation in an

eventuality.

4. The 2nd Defendant-Petitioner should settle all expenses of Marshalls Account and all dues to

the Sri Lanka Ports Authority pertaining to the services provided for the impugned Vessel

during the period of arrest.

Thereafter, on the 3rd of October 2022 this Court ordered the Vessel to be auctioned

for the reason that the Petitioner had failed to fulfil the aforementioned conditions. This

Court was also concerned about the environmental hazard that this Vessel posed.

Accordingly, the auction was held on the 18th of November 2022. The Marshal was

directed to cause the Vessel to be sold by public auction to the highest bidder under the

appraised value (i.e., United States Dollars One Million Two Hundred and Twenty Four

Thousand Three Hundred and Fifty Five).

According to Z1 (Journal Entry dated 24th November 2022) the Marshal has

informed the learned High Court Judge that the 22nd Respondent (M/S Sonar Shipping and

Management Services) was the highest bidder at that auction. The amount bid was United

States Dollars Eight Hundred and Ten Thousand. The Marshal had sought advice from the

Court on the next steps. Accordingly, the learned Judge has allowed the highest bidder to be

awarded. The relevant Journal Entry dated the same reads:

i.

ii. .

.

Page 7 of 8

The main argument of the Petitioner is that, inter alia,

a. The auction was held on the basis that the Vessel would not be sold below the

appraised value

b. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by not giving the Petitioner an opportunity

of being heard prior to the Order Z1 being made

c. The Order is contrary to the principles of natural justice

d. The learned Judge has failed to appreciate that the purpose of an auction is to obtain

the best value for the Vessel

e. The said Order defeats the objective of obtaining the best value for the Vessel

Thus, the Petitioner prayed for the reliefs alluded to above, and the following interim

reliefs in the meantime. These interim reliefs include:

i. Staying the effect of the Order of the Learned High Court Judge dated 24th

November 2022 annexed marked Z1;

ii. Preventing any further steps be taken in respect the auction of the vessel MV Sai

Arambh held on the 18th November 2022:

When this matter was argued today (the 16th of December) the learned State Counsel

appearing for the Marshal drew our attention to Rules 124 to 126 of the High Court

(Admiralty Jurisdiction) Rules 1991 (Extraordinary Gazette 672/7 dated 24th July 1991).

These Rules, set out for the purpose of convenience read:

124. The Judge may, either before or after final judgment, order any property under the

arrest of the Court to be appraised or to be sold with or without appraisement, and

either by public auction or by private contract.

125. If the property is deteriorating in value, the Judge may order it to be sold forthwith.

126. If the property to be sold is of small value, the Judge may if he thinks fit, order it to be

sold without a commission of sale being issued. [emphasis added]

Thereby, Rule 124 provides for sale with or without appraisement.

Page 8 of 8

In the instant case, the auction was held with appraisement. The bids should have

commenced from the baseline amount of the appraised value. However, it is strange to note

that despite the auction being conducted at the appraised rate, the learned Judge had

permitted a bid that was under that baseline value.

We are of the view, when the Marshal informed the learned High Court Judge that

there was no bidder for above that baseline value, the learned Judge should have cancelled

the said auction and ordered for another auction to be conducted without the appraisement.

The learned Judge had permitted the Vessel to be sold to the highest bidder, which is less

than the appraised value.

Thus, it appears that the learned Judge has erred, and accordingly we revise the said

impugned Order made on the 24th of November 2022 (Z1). Considering that there is a

dispute concerning the appraised value, we direct the learned Judge to order the auction to

be conducted under Rule 124 of the aforesaid Rules without the appraised value. We are of

the view that this would then attract more favorable bids. We further direct that the Marshal

to complete the auction within one months time from date of the direction of the learned

High Court Judge.

Considering the current state of the Vessel, which may pose a danger, We direct the

Petitioner to furnish a bank guarantee of a sum of United States Dollars Twenty Five million.

It is regrettable to note that the Harbour Master who was present in Court informed

us that it would take at least two months for the auction to be completed, even though the

previous auction was conducted within a period of less than two months when the Court of

Appeal made its aforesaid Order on 3rd October 2022.

This application is allowed.
