Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Panadura for causing the death of one Pohonwawa

Durage Upali on or about 07th February 2009, and thereby committing murder,

an offence punishable in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, the appellant was found guilty as charged by the

learned High Court Judge of Panadura, and was sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant

preferred this appeal.

The facts in brief are as follows;

The deceased was married to the sister of the appellant. They have got married

as a result of a love affair without the blessings of the family members of the

appellant. After the marriage, they had little contact with the appellant as well

as the other family members. This incident has happened two and a half years

after the marriage. During that time the deceased and his wife Sujeewa (PW-01)

were running a beauty saloon at the Kahathuduwa junction. They used to open

Page 3 of 10

the saloon around 9.00 a.m. and close around 7.30 in the night. The saloon

had two sections. The front section was used for the saloon and the smaller

back section was used as a resting area. They were living in a rented house

about two kilometers away from the saloon.

The appellant was the elder brother of PW-01. He was a driver by profession,

married and living in his wifes house in Polgasowita area. After her marriage,

the appellant has never visited the sister.

On the day of the incident, namely on the 07th February 2009 at around 4.30

in the evening, PW-01 was in the back section of the saloon preparing a drink,

while the deceased was with a customer who was having a haircut. After few

minutes, the witness has heard a sound of a scuffle and coming out to the

saloon section, she had seen her husband and the appellant engaged in a

scuffle. She had seen a knife in the hand of the appellant. She has then seen

the appellant running away and her husband with a stab wound to his

stomach. Although she has attempted to confront her brother, she has failed.

At the hospital, she had been informed that her husband has passed away.

The cross-examination of the witness reveals that her father had passed away

three months ago and the day of the incident was the third month alms giving.

Although the witness and the deceased had visited the funeral house, they had

not participated in the alms giving. It was her evidence that she did not know

that the alms giving was on that day. It had been suggested to the witness that

her brother came to the saloon to inquire into as to why she did not participate

in the alms giving and the deceased quarreled with him.

PW-05 Upali, was a person well known to the appellant. On the day of the

incident, he had been near a fruit stall belonging to one Shyam Kumara

situated near the place of the incident. He has seen the appellant coming in a

three-wheeler around four in the evening and alighting near the fruit stall, and

taking the knife that was on the deck of the stall and leaving calmly.

Page 4 of 10

According to the evidence of Shyam Kumara (PW-06) who was the owner of the

fruit stall, he had not been in the stall when the appellant had come and taken

the knife he used to cut fruits in his stall. After informing one of his friends

called Bhodika to look after the stall in his absence, he has gone to attend to

some other work, and upon his return he has been informed that another

person took the knife away. However, the witness has failed to identify the

knife produced by the prosecution as the knife he used.

As a result of that, the prosecution has treated the witness as a witness

detrimental to the prosecution under section 154 of the Evidence Ordinance

and had him subjected to cross-examination on that basis.

PW-09 Satheera was the customer who was with the deceased at the time of

the incident. According to his evidence, while the deceased was engaged in

cutting his hair, the appellant who walked into the saloon has started

assaulting the deceased without saying anything and it has lasted about thirty

seconds. The witness has then gone out of the saloon seeking help and has

seen the wife of the deceased engaging the appellant verbally, outside of the

saloon. He has also seen the appellant carrying a knife at that time. Later the

witness has seen the deceased holding on to a chair inside the saloon.

PW-17 was the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who has conducted the

postmortem on the deceased (the report marked P-04). He has observed three

cut injuries on the body. The 2nd and the 3rd had been to the left-hand fingers

and the palm, which he has described as defensive injuries. The 1st injury was

a deep stab injury to the stomach of the deceased which has penetrated deep

into the body cutting through several vital organs. And it was the opinion of the

JMO that this was an essentially fatal wound where the death could occur

within a short span of time.

At the conclusion of the prosecution case, and when the appellant was called

upon for a defence, he has chosen to give evidence under oath. He has

Page 5 of 10

admitted that the incident happened on the day of his fathers alms giving. It

was his position that since his sister and her husband did not attend the event,

he went to their saloon in order to ask the sister to come home as his mother

insisted that she wants to see her.

He has admitted having entered the saloon while the deceased was engaged in

cutting the heir of a customer. However, it was his position that as soon as he

entered, the deceased questioned him as to why he came, pushed him and

started assaulting him. It was also his position that the deceased got hold of a

knife from a nearby cupboard and attempted to stab him and due to the fear of

being attacked by him he struggled with the deceased in order to get the knife.

He has admitted that by the time his sister came to the scene the knife was in

his hand and the sister confronted him and a verbal confrontation occurred

outside of the saloon. He has claimed that thereafter, he discarded the knife

and came home in his three-wheeler.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant

urged the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

(1) The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider certain obvious

infirmities in the prosecution case.

(2) The learned High Court Judge failed to consider clear evidence that

there was a sudden fight.

(3) The learned High Court Judge sought to offer explanations in respect

of the prosecution case.

(4) The learned High Court Judge has come to a finding that there was

provocation and has stated that it was not sufficient and thereby

failed to consider cumulative provocation.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

I will now proceed to consider all the grounds of appeal together as they are

interrelated.

I am in no position to agree with the contention that the introduction of the

knife as evidence in the case was a result of a fabrication and the learned High

Court Judge has failed to address his mind to the said infirmity. On the

contrary, I find that fact has been well considered by the learned High Court

Judge.

As commented rightly by the learned High Court Judge, the failure by the

owner of the shop (PW-06) to identify the knife which was in his shop some

eight years after the event, was not a reason to consider the witness as a

witness hostile to the prosecution. Due to the fact that the witness has been

considered so, and subjected to cross-examination by the prosecution, the

learned High Court judge has decided not to consider the evidence of PW-06 for

the purposes of the judgment. However, the fact remains that it was a sharp

cutting weapon that has been used to cause injuries to the deceased and the

evidence of PW-05, which was uncontradicted evidence that it was the

appellant who came to the fruit stall belonging to PW-06 and took away the

knife used in the stall to cut fruit.

I am unable to agree with the contention that there was a sudden fight between

the appellant and the deceased and the learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider it in its correct perspective.

It is trite law that any stand taken by an accused in a case must be put to the

witnesses for them to respond to that position.

Page 7 of 10

In the case of Sarwan Singh Vs. State of Punjab 2002 AIR Supreme Court iii

3652 at 3655, 3656 it was stated thus;

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to

avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross examination, it

must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted.

His Lordship Sisra de Abrew, J. in the case of Pilippu Mandige Nalaka

Krishantha Thisera Vs. The Attorney General, CA 87/2005 decided on 17-

05-2007 held:

.I hold whenever evidence is given by a witness on a material point is

not challenged in cross-examination, it has to be concluded that such

evidence is not disputed and is accepted by the opponent subject of course

to the qualification that the witness is a reliable witness.

The Indian Supreme Court observed in the case of Motilal Vs. State of Madya

Pradesh (1990) (CLJ NOC 125 MP);

Absence of cross-examination of prosecution witnesses of certain facts

leads to inference of admission of that fact.

PW-09 would have been the best person to explain whether the incident was a

result of a sudden fight or not. He was a stranger who happened to be there as

a customer of the deceased. It was his evidence that the appellant who came

into the saloon started assaulting the deceased and the only question the

deceased asked was why. According to him the scuffle was a result of the

initial assault. As observed correctly by the learned High Court Judge, the two

defensive injuries clearly suggest that the deceased had attempted to evade the

appellant. The witness has been very specific in his evidence that the deceased

never attempted to attack the appellant.

If it was the position of the appellant that it was the deceased, who started to

assault him, when he went to meet his sister because their mother wanted her

Page 8 of 10

to come home. At least, the proposition of a sudden fight should have been put

to the witness who was the best person to speak about it, which has not been

done.

The PW-09 was a cogent and trustworthy witness and I find no reason to

disbelieve his evidence that there was no sudden fight, but an unexpected

assault on the deceased by the appellant.

The argument that there was cumulative provocation on the part of the

deceased for the appellant to act in the way he did is considered, it becomes

necessary to consider whether there was such evidence before the learned High

Court judge to come to a finding on such a basis.

In the case of E. Samithamby Vs. The queen 75 NLR 49, it was held that;

An offender may be said to have been deprived of his power of self-

control by grave and sudden provocation within the meaning of Exception I

to section 294 of the Penal Code even though there was an interval of time

between the giving of the provocation and the time of the killing, if the

evidence shows that, all the time during the interval, the accused suffered

under a loss of self-control.

In taking into consideration the plea of provocation the Courts look into the

prior relationship between the accused and the victim as relevant given the

facts and the circumstances of each case. [Vide- Jan Muhammad Vs.

Emperor- AIR 1929- Lahore-861, Nanavati Vs. State of Maharashtra- AIR

1962-605(SC)]

In Amarjit Singh Sohan Singh-1970, 76 Crim. LJ 835, Sankaria, J.

observed:

The past conduct of non-earning father in coming home drunk dailywas

already a standing and continuous source of provocation to the son whose

meagre earnings were hardly sufficient to meet the bear needs of the

Page 9 of 10

family. The restraint that was building up in the mind of the son as a

reaction to the continuous provocative conduct of the father spread over the

past month or so, had reached a braking point shortly before the

occurrence when the drunken father set upon the son with a torrent of

horrible oaths.

After taking into consideration the above judgments and the developments of

other jurisdictions, Kulatilaka, J. held in the case of Premalal Vs. Attorney

General (2000) 2 SLR 403, that;

Of late we observe a development in other jurisdictions where Courts

have taken a more pragmatic view of the mitigatory plea of provocation

in a series of cases Court took into consideration the prior course of

relationship between the accused and the victim.

Held further:

(1) The act of stabbing cannot be taken in isolation. The accused

appellants ambition of becoming a lecturer was shattered. He

could not face the campus community because he and M had

been seen as confirmed lovers in that community. His only

consolation had been M. He was losing her. The unusual

behaviour reflects the mental agony and the strain that the

accused was undergoing because of the haunting thought that

he was going to lose her.

(2) It could be inferred that he had lost all self-control at the point

of time he stabbed her. The brutal manner in which he attacked

the girl who was so precious to him, and the attempted suicide

are indictive of the fact that he in fact had lost his self-control

at the time of stabbing.

When it comes to the facts of the appeal under consideration, there was no

evidence of cumulative provocation of any kind. It is true that the sister of the

Page 10 of 10

appellant married the deceased against the wishes of the family members,

which has happened two and half years before. After the marriage the deceased

and the sister of the appellant has built their own life together, without being a

burden to anyone. Although it appears that there had been little or no contact

between the parties, that cannot be considered as a reason for any kind of

cumulative provocation.

It is clear from the evidence that the appellant has arrived at the saloon with

the motive of attacking the deceased. He has taken the right tool for that

purpose from the fruit stall and used that for the committing of the crime.

I find that the learned High Court Judge was correct in his assessment that

although there was previous anger for obvious reasons, that cannot be

considered as a sudden provocation. This Court is of the view that even it

cannot be considered as cumulative provocation in the absence of any evidence

in that regard.

For the reasons as aforementioned, I find no reason to interfere with the

conviction and the sentence of the appellant as the learned High Court Judge

has come to his findings with a proper analysis of the facts and the relevant

legal principles.

The appeal therefore is dismissed as it is devoid of any merit. The conviction

and the sentence affirmed.
