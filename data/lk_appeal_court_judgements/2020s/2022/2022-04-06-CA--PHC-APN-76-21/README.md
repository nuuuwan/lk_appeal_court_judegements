This is a revision application preferred against the High Court of Colombo

order dated 24.11.2020 in Case No HCB/2046/14 wherein the learned

High Court Judge refused to enlarge the petitioner on bail pending appeal.

While the counsel for the respondent raised several objections, the counsel

for the petitioner made submissions on a single legal issue. Hence, the

ensuing determination will limit itself to the said legal issue.

The petitioner was the former Additional Educational Director attached to

Nikaweratiya Educational Zone and was named the accused in the High

Court of Colombo Case No HCB/2046/14. She was charged in terms of

Section 20(b) read with 20(a) iv and Section 19 (c) of the Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act No 19 of 1994

(hereinafter the CIABOC Act). At the conclusion of the trial, the petitioner

CA-PHC-APN-76-21 Page 3 of 6 05/04/2022 IJ- 16-22

was found guilty and sentenced to 20 years of Rigorous Imprisonment for

all four charges, ordered to run concurrently, to be carried out in 10 years

commencing from the date of sentencing: 22.01.2020 Aggrieved by the said

conviction, the petitioner filed an application for appeal. Thereafter two

applications for bail pending appeal were preferred. Both were refused.

The petitioner has made the instant application to canvas the order of

refusal delivered by the learned High Court Judge dated 24.11.2020.

Aggrieved by such order, the petitioner has come before the Court of

Appeal to invoke the Courts revisionary jurisdiction.

At the outset, it must be noted that the revisionary jurisdiction of this

Court is a discretionary remedy available to a party who is dissatisfied with

an order or judgment of a lower court due to the presence of some

irregularity, illegality, absurdity in such order or judgment. Hence, the

primary contention to be determined by this Court is whether or not the

impugned order of the learned High Court Judge dated 24.11.2020 is in

any way improper to warrant the interference of the Court of Appeal acting

in revision.

A perusal of the impugned order reveals that the learned High Court Judge

has correctly insisted on the burden of proving the existence of exceptional

circumstances to grant bail to the petitioner. The impugned order

examines three exceptional circumstances submitted by the petitioner: her

medical condition, the plight of the 150 students enrolled in the

petitioners private school specializing in music and dancing occasioned

by the petitioners incarceration and the expected delay in concluding the

application of appeal. The learned High Court Judge correctly dismissed

all 3 grounds for want of exceptionality. The medical reports submitted as

proof of her condition are dated between 2005 and 2014; the petitioner

was sentenced in 2020. Even in the rare occasion a medical condition

would be accepted as an exceptional circumstance, the outdated medical

reports cannot in any way, be reliable. The party must prove the nexus

between the said medical condition and the immediate danger it poses to

CA-PHC-APN-76-21 Page 4 of 6 05/04/2022 IJ- 16-22

the person because of continued incarceration. i.e., the present danger to

the persons life. Concerning the purported delay in the conclusion of the

appeal, petitioner has failed to prove any excessive or oppressive delay. In

the impugned order, the learned High Court Judge refers to a Journal

Entry, which describes an instance where an attempt was made to subvert

the due administration of justice, which was an additional element

considered by the High Court in refusing to release the petitioner on bail.

Now that the impugned order has been examined, the submissions made

by the counsel for the petitioner will be evaluated.

The counsel for the petitioner submitted that he would be raising a

question of law that was not raised during the trial but will be taken up in

appeal. The counsel sought to raise the same objection in the instant

matter, stating that the issue of law amounts to an exceptional

circumstance. He submitted that the nature of this question of law and its

implications affect the very root of the prosecution instituted against the

petitioner, thus amounting to an exceptional circumstance warranting the

release of the petitioner on bail pending appeal. In the submission, the

counsel for the petitioner referred to the precedent set by Anoma

Polwatte v Jayawickrama Director General, Bribery Commission and

Others SC (writ) 01/2011 SC Minute dated 26.07.2018, Nandasena

Gotabhaya Rajapakse v CIABOC CA (Revision) APN No 29/2018 CA

Minute dated 12.09.2019 and another similar case. It was submitted that

the legal issue thus raised points to patent illegality because there is a

great likelihood that the petitioner would be acquitted in appeal and that

the continued incarceration of the petitioner is unjustifiable. The petitioner

contended that the respondent has failed to provide evidence of the

certificate of 03 Commissioners of the Bribery Commission signing and

authorizing the filing of this action which is now deemed to be an imperative

prerequisite in respect of action instituted by the Bribery Commission (Vide

Paragraph 16 of the Petition).

CA-PHC-APN-76-21 Page 5 of 6 05/04/2022 IJ- 16-22

Anoma Polwatte Case (Supra) was occasioned by a case filed before the

Magistrate Court under Section 78(1) of the Bribery Act whereby the

Supreme Court was sitting in its writ jurisdiction determined on the

application of Section 11 of the CIABOC Act. The Supreme Court quashed

the charge sheet against the petitioner on the basis that a valid directive

as per Section 11 of the CIABOC Act was absent. Gotabaya Rajapakse

Case (Supra) concerned a revision application wherein the institution of

proceedings under Section 78 of the Bribery Act was impugned. The

judgment went on to discuss the nature of the written sanction as

envisaged by Section 78 of the Bribery Act. The Court of Appeal

in Gotabaya Rajapakse Case (Supra) held that the existence of a written

sanction was a prerequisite to institute criminal action in the Magistrate

Court under Section 78 of the Bribery Act and held that the Bribery

Commission cannot independently institute criminal actions. The instant

matter deals with a criminal action instituted in the High Court by way of

an indictment under Section 11 of the CIABOC Act. The counsel for the

petitioner failed to elaborate on how the determinations of Anoma

Polwatte Case (Supra) and Gotabaya Rajapakse Case (Supra) affects the

circumstances of the instant application where action has been instituted

before the High Court as opposed to the Magistrate Court. (See B. A.

Ranjan Somasinghe v Director General, Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption CPA 2/21 CA Minute dated

11.01.2022). A mere citing of judgments will not entitle a party to benefit

under the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal when the burden

placed on such party is to prove exceptional circumstances. The counsel

for the petitioner failed to demonstrate the fundamental nexus between

the determinations in the cited judgments, which dealt with cases

instituted in the Magistrate Court and the instant application, which

concerns an action filed in the High Court. The burden placed on the

petitioner is to prove that the facts and circumstances of the application

is of such exceptionality that it shocks the conscience of this Court. This,

the petitioner failed to do.

In any event, as pronounced by a Divisional Bench of the Court of Appeal

in Ajahn Gardiye Punchihewa v Officer in Charge Financial

Investigation Unit III CA (Writ) Application No. WRT 311/2019 CA Minute

dated 18.06.2020, which was later relied on by this Bench in Director

General, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or

Corruption v W. A. Lalith Kumara CA Application No. LTA/06/16 CA

Minute Dated 23.02.2022, it is the considered view of this Court that the

Court of Appeal sitting in revision cannot entertain the legal issue raised

by the petitioner.

Bail refused.

Application dismissed.
