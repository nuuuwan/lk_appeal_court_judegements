R. Gurusinghe, J.

The Accused Appellant (the appellant) was indicted in the High Court of

Badulla for having committed the murder of one Nihal Sisira Kumara, an

offence punishable in terms of Section 296 of the Penal Code.

After trial, the appellant was convicted as charged and sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence, the appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

Prosecution Case

The deceased was a bus driver attached to the Keppetipola, Sri Lanka

Transport Board depot. On the 12th of December 2003, the deceased and PW1

Wijeratne had gone to Welimada town. PW1 bought some fertilizer from a

shop, and he went to find a three-wheeler to transport the fertilizer. The

3

deceased stayed back. He was standing on the pavement outside the shop until

PW1 returned. When PW1 was coming back to the shop, he saw the appellant

coming behind the deceased, and stabbed him at the back. The appellant

stabbed the deceased twice on the shoulder. PW1 was about 7 to 8 meters

away from the place where the appellant stabbed the deceased.

PW2, a sales assistant at the shop, had also seen the stabbing. PW1 and PW2

both knew the appellant before the incident, as he is a conductor of a private

bus, which regularly takes the route from Welimada to Nuwara-Eliya. PW1

immediately took the deceased to the Welimada hospital. The deceased was

then transferred from the Welimada hospital to the Badulla hospital. While he

was being taken to the Badulla hospital, he succumbed to his injuries, and the

ambulance returned to the Welimada hospital.

The Defence case

The appellant making a dock statement stated that on the day of the incident,

the deceased and four others assaulted him and the deceased came towards

him with a knife and the deceased fell on his body when they grappled with

each other. He did not say that he stabbed the deceased, but he said that

during the struggle, the deceased suffered stab injuries accidentally. He did

not explain how the deceased had sustained two wounds on the back of his

chest. He also stated that somehow the handle of the knife was in his hand,

and he went to the police station and handed over the handle of the knife to

the police. The defence called no other witness.

When this matter came up for hearing, Counsel for the appellant relied on two

grounds of appeal against the conviction.

1. The appellant was not mentally fit to stand trial at the time of the trial.

4

2. The cause of death of the deceased was not established beyond

reasonable doubt.

It was submitted for the appellant that, as per the proceedings dated 16th

December 2008, the learned High Court Judge observed that the appellant had

been taking treatment for a mental illness. Then the learned Trial Judge

directed the authorities at the Ragama hospital to evaluate whether the

appellant was mentally fit to stand trial. However, no report from the

psychiatrist was filed of record.

The case came up before the same High Court Judge on the 30th of April 2009,

and nothing has been mentioned about the mental condition of the appellant.

It is to be noted that there was no application from Counsel for the appellant at

the trial, to the effect that the appellant was not fit to stand trial. Counsel for

the appellant at that time submitted to court that, as the appellant was at the

hospital the previous day, he was unable to appear before the court. He

mentioned this fact only as an excuse for the absence of the appellant on the

last date. A photocopy of the diagnostic ticket was produced. It did not bear a

seal or a signature of a doctor. The trial started on the 6th of January 2011,

that is more than a year later. The appellant was represented by a Senior

Counsel right throughout the trial. The issue of the fitness of the appellant to

stand trial was never raised at the trial.

Section 375 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads as follows:

375. (1) If any person Committed for trial before the High Court appears to the

court at his trial to be of unsound mind and consequently incapable of making

his defence, the jury or (where the trial is without a jury) the Judge of the High

Court shall in the first instance try the fact of such unsoundness and incapacity,

5

and if satisfied of the fact shall find accordingly and thereupon the trial shall be

postponed.

(2) The trial of the fact of the unsoundness of mind and incapacity of the accused

shall be deemed to be part of his trial before the court.

It would appear that before the Trial Judge tries the fact of unsoundness and

incapacity, it must appear to him that the accused was of unsound mind and

consequently incapable of defending himself. This is the first stage, and only

when the first stage is complete, the Trial Judge must try the fact of such

unsoundness and incapacity before the judge proceeds with the trial.

The issue of whether the accused was mentally fit to stand trial may be raised

by the accused, the prosecution, or by the judge himself. If an accused raises

the defence of an unsound mind, the burden of proof is on the accused.

(Section 105 of the evidence ordinance). Similarly, I am of the view that if the

accused is not fit to stand trial, it is for the accused to prove that fact.

The appellant did not raise the issue of mental fitness at the beginning or

during the trial. It seems that the learned Judge had not observed anything to

the effect that the appellant was not fit to stand trial.

The appellant had retained a Senior Counsel to defend him, and he was

defended by the Counsel throughout the trial. Therefore, it is manifested that

the appellant had the ability to aid his Counsel in his defence. If there were

any deficiency, the learned Counsel would have noticed and brought them to

the notice of the learned Trial Judge.

In the case of King vs Pindorrisa 29 NLR 385,Lyall Grant J. stated regarding the

capacity as follows:

6

I charge the jury that they should in the first place consider the question

whether the accused was capable of making his defence, whether he sufficiently

understand the proceedings what is alleged against him, what he was entitled to

do and say his power to bring forward witnesses in his defence.

In the case of Dusky vs United States 362 US402 [1960], the U.S.Supreme

Court held that; to be competent to stand trial the accused must have a

sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of

rational understanding and a rational as well as factual understanding of the

proceedings against him.

In the instant case, the appellant was defended by the counsel throughout the

trial and the appellant made along dock statement as his defence. The

appellant absconded the trial for two years and he said that because of this

case, he lost his income and he had to go abroad to do a job. Therefore, it is

clear that he had understood the charge against him and given proper

instruction to his counsel. After considering the above-mentioned case laws,

the provisions of law and the circumstances, I see no deficiency in making his

defence by the appellant at the trial court. Therefore, this ground of appeal has

no merit and I reject the same.

The second ground of appeal is that the prosecution did not establish the

cause of death of the deceased. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the

doctor who conducted the post-mortem inquiry was not called as a witness.

The doctor who performed the post-mortem was unavailable to give evidence

before the court as he was seriously ill and not competent to testify in court.

There were two eyewitnesses, namely PW1 and PW2, who saw the appellant

stabbing the deceased from the back. There was no serious challenge against

the testimony of these two eyewitnesses.

7

The Judicial Medical Officer gave evidence using the post-mortem report (PMR)

prepared by Dr. Dissanayake. As per the PMR and the evidence, there were

two deep stab injuries on the back of the chest of the deceased. As per the

evidence of the doctor, the stab injuries penetrated the lungs of the deceased

and damaged the arteries of the lung. The doctor described that such injuries

would cause the death of a person in the ordinary course of nature.

The evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer who gave evidence before the court

was not challenged by the defence at all. Only two questions were put to the

doctor by the defence, to the effect that the doctor gave evidence based on the

PMR prepared by Dr. Dissanayake and he himself did not conduct the post-

mortem examination. In the above circumstances, the evidence of the doctors

stands unchallenged.

The evidence of the two eyewitnesses also stands uncontradicted.

The appellant in his dock statement took up the position that the deceased

along with four others attacked him. There was a struggle but he did not say

how the deceased sustained two stab injuries on the back of the chest. None of

the witnesses has seen any kind of commotion or struggle. This position is not

put to the prosecution witnesses. The appellant stated that he had the handle

of the knife in his hand, and he went to the police station with the handle of

the knife. The appellant did not say how the handle of the knife came into his

possession.

The evidence clearly establishes the fact that the deceased died of stab injuries,

caused by the appellant.

8

For the reasons set out above, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of

the learned Trial Judge. The judgment and the sentence imposed on the

appellant is affirmed.

The appeal of the appellant is dismissed.
