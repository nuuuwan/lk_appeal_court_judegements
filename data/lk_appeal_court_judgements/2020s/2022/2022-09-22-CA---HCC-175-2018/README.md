R. Gurusinghe, J.

The Accused Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Kuliyapitiya for

having committed intercrural sex on a 15-year-old boy, an offence punishable

in terms of Section 365 B (2) b of the Penal Code.

The Evidence-in-Chief of PW1 (the victim, who was a 23-year-old man at the

time of the trial) has been led. The appellant pleaded guilty. He was convicted

upon the plea of guilty and sentenced to 15 years rigorous imprisonment and

fined Rs. 25,000/- with a default term of 10 months Simple Imprisonment. In

addition, the appellant was ordered to pay Rs. 200,000/- as compensation to

3

PW1. The appellant had already paid Rs. 100,000/- to PW1 on 27.02.2018 in

open court.

Counsel for the appellant submitted that 15 years rigorous imprisonment was

excessive in the circumstances of the case and sought a reduction in the term

of imprisonment. The Learned Deputy Solicitor General appeared for the

respondent submitted that, she had no objection to the reduction of the prison

term. However, she pointed out that the offence carries a 7-year minimum

mandatory sentence.

The appellant offered to plead guilty even prior to the commencement of the

trial, but it was not allowed at that time. After the evidence-in-chief of PW1 was

completed, the plea of guilty of the appellant was recorded and sentenced as

mentioned above.

As per the evidence of PW1, the appellant had not threatened nor had he used

any sort of violence on the victim. The victim had sustained no injuries.

Besides the victim had a cordial relationship with the appellant. Although the

victim was a 15-year-old boy at that time, he had never made a complaint to

anybody, not even to his parents, about the appellant. The appellant had no

previous convictions.

Considering the above circumstances, I am of the view that the sentence

imposed on the appellant is excessive. I, therefore, set aside the sentence and

substitute the same with the following sentence.

(1) Seven years rigorous imprisonment, (2) a fine of Rupees 10,000/- and if

defaulted, three months Simple Imprisonment, (3) Rs. 100,000/- compensation

to PW1, which had already been paid.

I further direct that the term of imprisonment is deemed to have been served

from the date of incarceration, namely 26.7.2018.

The appeal is partially allowed. The sentence varied.

I agree.
