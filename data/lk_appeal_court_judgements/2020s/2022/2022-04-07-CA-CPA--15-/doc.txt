MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to set aside the order

dated 9.10.2018 of the High Court of Chilaw.

The accused petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) has been

indicted in the High Court under section 296 and 315 of the Penal Code.

The petitioner had pleaded not guilty to the indictment and the trial in the

High Court had commenced, and halfway through the trial the petitioner had

pleaded guilty to a lesser offence under section 297 of the Penal Code based

on sudden fight.

The person who sustained injury in the incident namely Sarath Kumara had

been led in evidence and according to him on the day of the incident, he and

the deceased who were working together had gone fishing and while doing

so the deceased had received a call stating that the wife of the deceased had

been assaulted by the accused. The witness and the deceased had gone to

see the injured wife of the deceased and they had seen the wife of the

deceased bleeding from the head. According to the witness the deceased

had got very upset and angry and had gone in search of the accused, and

when they found him the accused had been clutching one child to his chest

and the other child had been standing near him. The deceased and the

witness had confronted him and the accused had warned them not to

come forward but they had proceeded towards the accused when the

accused had taken a knife and had stabbed the witness and the deceased

both.

According to the submissions of the petitioner he is not contesting the

conviction but only the sentence of 12 years which had been imposed for

count number one.

The Counsel for the respondents stated that the instant application has

been filed without exercising his right of appeal and the instant application

has been filed after a lapse of two years.

But the Counsel for the petitioner contended that the petitioner had

undergone many financial hardships and his two children are in the

custody of an orphanage and on humanitarian grounds to overlook the

delay in filling the application and to consider the excessive nature of the

sentence imposed and reduce the same in view of the nature of the

evidence adduced at the half concluded trial.

It is a well understood and established norm in revision that if a party files

a revision application the party filling the same must satisfy Court that

there is an exceptional ground which shocks the conscious of Court and it

must be filed without undue delay. If there is a delay it needs to be

explained in a satisfactory manner. This Court too in a similar application

has held the same. (CA/PHC/APN/21/2021.)

But nevertheless in view of the humanitarian grounds urged by the

Counsel this Court will consider the instant application inspite of the delay

in filling the instant application and inspite of the right of appeal not being

explained. It has been held in the case of Rustom vs Hapangama (1978

SLRVol.2 Page No.225) Justice Ismail stated that, The trend of authority

clearly indicates that where the revisionary powers of the Court of Appeal

are invoked the practice has been that these powers will be exercised if

there is an alternative remedy available only if the existence of special

circumstances are urged necessitating the indulgence of this court to

exercise these powers in revision. If the existence of special circumstances

does not exist then this court will not exercise its powers in revision. The

same has been held in the case of Rashid Ali vs. Mohammed Ali 1936 6CLW

and Soza J. remarked thus, The powers of revision conferred on the Court

of Appeal are very wide and the Court has the discretion to exercise them

whether an appeal lies or not or whether an appeal had been taken or not.

However, this discretionary remedy can be invoked only where there are

exceptional circumstances warranting the intervention of the Court.

In view of the evidence of the Sarath Kumara led in the trial it is very

evident that,

Page 5 of 6

1) The deceased along with the witness had gone in search of the

accused,

2) Accused had been clutching a child and holding a another,

3) The accused had pleaded with them not to come near him but the

deceased had resisted and had proceeded towards the accused,

4) One stab injury on the deceased which had been the fatal injury.

Therefore it is very clear that it has ensued from the deceased quest to

confront the accused and the accused had pleaded not to come near him,

who had been with two children admitted by the injured in evidence.

Therefore the question arises whether it was the result of a sudden fight or

whether the accused had the knowledge of his actions.

According to the submissions of the petitioner the accused had no

intention for the actions committed but only knowledge because he was

with his two children.

The exception under Section 297 of the penal Code based on knowledge

has been defined as an act which is imminently dangerous that, it must in

all probability cause death or bodily injury which is likely to cause death.

Therefore, Court must consider the act done by the accused and the

circumstances surrounding the act to determine the existence of

knowledge. In view of the evidence led at the trial this Court too sees some

merit in the submission because the witness says that he was clutching one

child to his chest. Therefore for him to be stabbing with intention is very

remote

Therefore this Court is of the view that it is an incident based on

knowledge and not sudden fight and as such this Court varies the sentence

imposed for the first Count and imposes a sentence of six years rigorous

imprisonment from the date of conviction, and the rest of the sentence

remains the same, subject the said variation the instant application for

revision is dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
