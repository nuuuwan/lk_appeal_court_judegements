This is an appeal against the order dated 10.12.2018, delivered by the

Provincial High Court of the Southern Province holden in Matara which

acted in revision and affirmed the order dated 20.01.2016, delivered by

the learned Magistrate of Deiyandara, in case no. 07998, where the

preliminary objections put forth by the appellant were disallowed and the

matter was fixed for trial.

Therefore, the Presidents Counsel for appellant seeks to set aside the

aforesaid order dated 10.12.2018 of the High Court of Matara by

submitting the following averments before this Court:

4

CA-PHC-0238-18 Page 4 of 10 15/12/2022 IJ-59-22

1. The action instituted against the appellant is contrary to Article 13

(6) of the Constitution.

2. That the Charge Sheet is defective and does not conform to the

requirements set out in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act no.15 of

1979

3. No prima facie case was established against the appellant.

The facts of the case are briefly as follows. The appellant is alleged to have

sold two packets of Pinnacle Margarine without listing the food additives

contained therein, contrary to Regulation 4(2)(a) of the Food (Labelling and

Advertising) Regulations 2005 Extraordinary Gazette Notification No.

1376/9 dated 19th January 2005, which in turn also amounts to an

offence under Section 3 (1) of the Food Act. Consequently, the learned

Magistrate on 02.05.2014 read out the charge sheet to the, appellant.

However, the appellant pleaded not guilty to the charges.

At this juncture, it is pertinent to reproduce the Regulation which the

appellant failed to comply with.

Regulation 4 (2)(a) of the Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 1376/9

dated 19th January 2005 reads as follows:

The following declaration shall be made on any panel in any one or more

of the three languages-

a) Any permitted food additives name or INS number as prescribed

by regulations made under the Act; ... (emphasis added)

Accordingly, the names of the permitted food additives must be declared

on the package in either Sinhala, Tamil or English. However, the

appellants major contention is the maintainability of the action due to the

defects in the charge sheet and the improper application of the law.

5

CA-PHC-0238-18 Page 5 of 10 15/12/2022 IJ-59-22

Regulation 4 (2)(a) of the Gazette Notification No. 1376/9 does not indicate

a list of the permitted additives, albeit the law requires the declaration of

food additives on the package. This lacuna of the law was corrected by

implementing the Extraordinary Gazette 1795/51 dated 01st of February

2013, where Regulation 10 delineated a list of the permitted food additives,

which was published consequent to the Extraordinary Gazette

implemented in 2005.

As per Regulation 1 of the Extraordinary Gazette 1795/51 dated

01.02.2013, the said regulation comes into force on the 1st of July 2014.

Therefore, the alleged offence of the appellant has been committed prior to

the enforcement of the said regulation as the offence took place on the 22nd

January of 2014. Thus, the preliminary objection of the learned Presidents

Counsel appearing for the appellant is that the offence has been charged

under the Extraordinary Gazette No. 1376/9 dated 19th January 2005,

which did not promulgate a list of permitted food additives. Therefore, the

Presidents Counsel further contends that, even though the Gazette

Notification of 2005 creates a requirement to label the food packages, the

mandatory requirement of declaring the permitted food additives cannot

be fulfilled, unless read with the consequent regulation 10 of the Gazette

Notification dated in 2013.

The charges against the appellant have been framed by the Magistrate

Court of Deiyandara, for acting in contravention of the Extraordinary

Gazette no 1376/9 dated 19th January 2005, which is incomplete till the

subsequent publication of the Gazette Notification of 2013 and as the said

regulations did not come into operation until after the commission of the

alleged offence by the appellant, the question of retrospective effect of laws

become the pivotal point of this instant matter.

6

CA-PHC-0238-18 Page 6 of 10 15/12/2022 IJ-59-22

Article 13 (6) of the Constitution stipulates that:

No person shall be held guilty of an offence on account of any act or

omission which did not, at the time of such act or omission, constitute

such an offence, and no penalty shall be imposed for any offence more

severe than the penalty in force at the time such offence was

committed.

Nothing in this Article shall prejudice the trial and punishment of any

person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was

committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law

recognized by the community of nations.

Therefore, as per the above constitutional provision, the retrospective

application of the law is restricted and strictly remitted to such crimes

which are recognized as criminal, even in the absence of a corresponding

law at the commission of the offence, by the general principles of law

recognized by the community of nations.

The above contention promulgated under Article 13 (6) of the Constitution

was further affirmed in the Supreme Court determination on Bill titled

Offences Against Aircraft Act by His Lordship Chief Justice N.D.M.

Samarakoon and four other Justices of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in

S.D. NO.2 OF 1982 P/Parl/22, where it was determined that

The offences referred to in the Bill are all criminal according to the general

principles of law recognized by the community of Nations, Part II of the Bill

is sought to be made retrospective from July 3, 1978. Such retrospective

operation is permitted by the provisions of Article 13 of the Constitution. We

are, therefore, of opinion that the provisions of the Bill are not inconsistent

with the constitution. (emphasis added)

7

CA-PHC-0238-18 Page 7 of 10 15/12/2022 IJ-59-22

Nonetheless, under Article 75 of the Constitution, the Parliament has the

power to make laws which do bear retrospective effect and furthermore

under Article 76, it is further held that:

76 (1)

(2)

(3) It shall not be a contravention of the provisions of

Paragraph (1) of this Article for Parliament to make any law

containing any provision empowering any person or body to

make subordinate legislation for prescribed purposes

including the power:

(a) to appoint a date on which any law or any part thereof

shall come into effect or cease to have effect.

(b)

(emphasis added)

Hence, accordingly the Constitution has vested the power of making

retrospective laws as well as the power of determination of the date of

operation of laws, on the Parliament.

However, according to the Constitutional provision under Article 13 (6),

such laws shall not hinder a person from being entitled to the protection

guaranteed by the Constitution itself, especially in light of laws which do

not constitute an offence at the time of commission of the said offence

unless otherwise prescribed through general principles of law recognized

by the community of nations.

According to the Section 32 of the Food Act No 26 0e 1980 as amended 20

of 1991 and 29 of 2011 the Minister may make regulations in respect of

matters required by this Act. Section 32(2) further states-

8

CA-PHC-0238-18 Page 8 of 10 15/12/2022 IJ-59-22

2) Every regulation made by the Minister shall be published in the Gazette

and shall come into operation on the date of publication or on such later date

as may be specified in the regulation. (emphasis added)

Therefore, the appellant cannot be charged under the Extraordinary

Gazette Notification of 2013 as it has no retrospective application of the

law, as the offence was committed prior to the enforcement of the said

Regulation in 2014 on the 1st of July. In the case of Edirisinghe Vs Cassim

S.I. Police {1945} 46 N.L.R. 334, Where the accused was charged for

contravening a Defence (Control of Textiles) Regulation, which was not to

come into force until such date as was fixed by the Governor and notified in

the Gazette, but no reference was made, either in the charge or in the

evidence, to the Gazette which brought the Regulation into force- Held, that

the Court could take judicial notice of the date on which the Regulation came

into operation.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant further avers that, due

to the framing of charges under the Gazette notification of 2005 which is

incomplete, the charges framed by the learned Magistrate of Deiyandara

is bad in law and cannot be maintained due to the lack of conformity to

Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act no.15 of 1979 (CCPA).

Section 164 of the CCPA requires the fulfilment of the criteria set out

therein. However, in the instant matter, the appellant avers that

subsection (5) of the said provision has not been fulfilled.

Section 164 (5) reads as follows:

(5) The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a statement that

every legal condition required by law to constitute the offence charged

was fulfilled in the particular case.

9

CA-PHC-0238-18 Page 9 of 10 15/12/2022 IJ-59-22

Hence, due to the lack of indication of both the Extraordinary Gazette

no.1376/9 and Extraordinary Gazette No.1795/51, and framing the

charges under the Extraordinary Gazette No. 1376/9 alone, it results in

non-compliance of Section 164 of the CCPA. Therefore, this Court is of the

opinion that the learned Magistrate has erred in law in framing charges

under the Extraordinary Gazette No. 1376/9, which cannot be maintained

without the subsequent enactment of the Extraordinary Gazette

No.1795/51 of 2013.The learned Presidents Counsel submits the case of

Carolis Appu Vs Assistant Government Agent Haputhale 46 NLR 262

to buttress his argument. Where it held that transport of kurakkan (Finger

Millet) without a permit is made an offence by the amendment to the

Defence (Purchases of Foodstuffs) Regulation 1942 and no reference is

made in the charge to the Gazette in which the amending regulation was

published the failure to refer to such Gazette was fatal to the conviction.

In this regard, this Court reflects upon the case of Abdul Sameen Vs

Bribery Commissioner 1991 1 SLR 76, which states as follows:

Furthermore, whilst appreciating the pressures on time and the large

volume of work the Magistrate Court are called upon to handle, it

nevertheless is important that rights of an accused person are safeguarded

and that he be brought to trial according to accepted fundamental principles

of criminal procedure. (emphasis added)

Accordingly, this Court is of the observation that the Magistrate has a duty

to examine whether the requirements set out in the CCPA has been fulfilled

to frame charges and to scrutinize whether the charge drafted by the

complainant respondent (PHI) has fulfilled the requirements to file the

charge sheet. Thus, due to the erroneous charge sheet and since there is

no offence committed by the appellant, at the time of the enforced

Extraordinary Gazette of 2013, the charges framed by the learned

10

CA-PHC-0238-18 Page 10 of 10 15/12/2022 IJ-59-22

Magistrate cannot be maintained. Magistrates usually do not frame charges

themselves in every case but accepts the draft charge which is tendered by

prosecuting party. Yet in law, it is the charge framed by the Magistrate from

the time it is accepted. (See CA PHC 108/2010 CA minute dated

26.08.2014).

Therefore, as the requirements stated therein have not been fulfilled, this

Court observes that the charge sheet is bad in law and the learned

Magistrate has erred in law in drafting the charges. Hence, this Court is of

the view that the learned High Court Judge has erroneously concluded the

order dated 10.12.2018, by affirming the order dated 20.01.2016 of the

learned Magistrate. Hence, this Court sets aside both the orders of the

High Court of Matara and the Magistrate Court of Deiyandara.

Appeal is allowed.
