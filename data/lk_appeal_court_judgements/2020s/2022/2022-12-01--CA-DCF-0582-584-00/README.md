Judgment

The Plaintiff instituted action bearing No. 7202/P, in the District Court of

Kuliyapitiya praying to have the land morefully described in the schedule to the

plaint partitioned in terms of the Partition Act No. 21 of 1997.

It appears that originally, the Plaintiff only made 1st to 3rd Defendants as parties but

subsequently 4th to 11th Defendants intervened and claimed rights in respect of the

corpus sought to be partitioned. The Plaintiff died on 24.01.1991 pending action and

on his demise, Jayakodi Mudiyanselage Kusumawathie, the daughter of deceased

Plaintiff was substituted in place of the deceased Plaintiff, and the substituted

Plaintiff proceeded to prosecute the action originally filed by the deceased Plaintiff.

The Registered Attorney of the 1st, 4th, 6th and 7th Defendant-Respondents had filed

their statements of claim on 21.03.1995 and 11th Defendant-Respondent had filed

her statement of claim on 31.10.1995. The trial commenced on 03.05.1999 and 31

points of contest were entered by the parties.

While the trial was going on, the 5th Defendant-Respondent had died on 20.10.1996

and three children of the 5th Defendant-Respondent had been substituted on his

behalf. At the trial, evidence was adduced by the Substituted Plaintiff and S.M

Abeykoon (Licensed Surveyor). The 1st Defendant, 3rd Defendant, M.S.T.P Senadeera

(Licensed Surveyor), K. Ranjith Pieris, S.M Podirathna (husband of the 4th Defendant-

Respondent) had given evidence on behalf of the Defendants.

However, at the conclusion of the trial the learned District Judge of Kuliyapitiya had

delivered his Judgment dated 12.09.2000 granting relief to the deceased Plaintiff as

prayed for in the plaint.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment, 5A Defendant-Appellant had preferred appeal

bearing No. CA 582/2000 (F), 11th Defendant-Appellant and 4th Defendant-Appellant

also preferred appeals bearing Nos. 583/2000 (F) and 584/2000(F) respectively.

The position taken up by the 5A Defendant-Appellant and the Substituted 4th

Defendant-Appellant was that the Judgment of the District Court of Kuliyapitiya in

case bearing No. 7202/P is invalid because the 6th Defendant and the 10th Defendant

had died prior to the delivery of the Judgment and the Substituted Plaintiff-

Page 10 of 16

Respondent had failed to take necessary steps to substitute legal heirs of the 6th

Defendant and the 10th Defendant to proceed with the trial.

The said Appellant had relied on the case Gamaralalage Karunawathie Vs.

Godayalage Piyasena S.C. Application No. 09A/2010 decided on 05.12.2011

reported in [2012] BLR 81 in which the Supreme Court held that in a situation where

the Plaintiff had failed to take steps to substitute in room of the deceased parties

and has delivered a Judgment, such Judgment is bad in law and the case should be

remitted back to the District Court for substitution in room of the deceased party

and to be re-heard.

However, Chitrasiri, J. held in the case of Jane Nona and others Vs. Surabiel and

others [2013] 1 SLR 346 that the decision in Gamaralalage Karunawathie Vs.

Godayalage Piyasena [supra] was made per incuriam on the ground that a binding

authority or a statute has not been brought to the attention of Court and it was

decided in ignorance or forgetfulness of that authority or the statute.

The decision in Gamaralalage Karunawathie Vs. Godayalage Piyasena [supra] is

not absolutely binding on the Court of Appeal since there had been a failure to

consider specific provisions in the Partition Law (Section 81 of the amending Act No.

17 of 1997) in respect of non-substitution of deceased parties in partition actions.

It was held in the case of Jane Nona and others Vs. Surabiel and others [supra]

that the decision in Gamaralalage Karunawathie Vs. Godayalage Piyasena

[supra] was given per incuriam and accordingly, it is an exception to the application

of the doctrine of stare decisis. This is because case law cannot overrule statutory

provisions laid down by an enactment of the legislature.

It is apparent that Section 81 (9) was introduced in 1997 after the original Partition

Act was enacted. Since the Court of Appeal is not bound by the said Judgment of

Gamaralalage Karunawathie Vs. Godayalage Piyasena [supra], the Judgment in

the instant case is valid, effective and enforceable and need not be remitted back

to the District Court of Kuliyapitiya.

In this instance, Court observes that the 6th Defendant died on 18th May 1987, prior

to the introduction of Section 81 to the Partition Law.

However, Section 48 (1) of the Partition Act stipulates:

Page 11 of 16

(1) Save as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the interlocutory

decree entered under section 26 and the final decree of partition entered

under section 36 shall, subject to the decision on any appeal which may be

preferred therefrom, and in the case of an interlocutory decree, subject also

to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section, be good and sufficient

evidence of the title of any person as to any right, share or interest awarded

therein to him and be final and conclusive for all purposes against all persons

whomsoever, whatever rights title or interest they have, or claim to have to

or in the land to which such decree relates and notwithstanding any omission

or defect of procedure or in the proof of title adduced before the court or

the fact that all persons concerned are not parties to the partition action;

and the right, share or interest awarded by any such decree shall be free from

all encumbrances whatsoever other than those specified in that decree.

In this subsection omission or defect of procedure shall include an omission

or failure-

(a)

(b) to substitute the heirs or legal representatives of a party who dies pending

the action or to appoint a person to represent the estate of the deceased

party for the purposes of the action; or

(c)

Hence, it is imperative to note that non-substitution of the deceased 6th Defendant

and the 10th Defendant does not invalidate the Judgment delivered on 12.09.2000

by the learned District Judge of Kulliyapitiya.

The 5A Defendant-Appellant had contended that Punchimenike purchased rights

along with Mudalihamy from Kiribanda by 5V1.

In this respect, it is worthy to note the points of contest raised on behalf of the 1,

5, 5, 5 and 6, 7, 8 Defendants.

1, 5, 5, 5 6, 7, 8

15. 1, 5, 6, 7

1, 5, 6 7 ? 1, 5, 6 7

.

16.

? 1, 5, 6 7 .

The learned District Judge had answered the points of contest Nos. 13 and 14 in the

negative and Nos. 15 and 16 as follows;

15. 1, 5, 6 7 .

16. 1, 5, 6 7 .

It appears that the 1st Defendant adduced evidence on behalf of the 1,5,6,7,8

Defendants and closed their case by marking documents 11 15, 51 53

and 81.

It is significant to note that the said document 51 was marked in evidence at the

examination in chief of the Substituted Plaintiff namely Kusumawathie and also led

in evidence of the 1st Defendant indicates that Kiribanda had transferred undivided

1/6 share to Jayakodi Mudiyanselage Mudalihamy and Pathirannehelage

Punchimenika by Deed bearing No. 7530 dated 03.04.1923 marked as 51.

Subsequently, the said Jayakodi Mudiyanselage Mudalihamy and Pathirannehelage

Punchimenika had transferred 2 acres, 1 rood and 24 perches to Jayakodi

Mudiyanselage Kusumawathie by Deed bearing No. 1900 dated 02.12.1976 marked

as 52.

Similarly, the said Jayakodi Mudiyanselage Mudalihamy and Pathirannehelage

Punchimenika had transferred 2 rood and 32 perches from their balance entitlement

to Jayakodi Mudiyanselage Karunaratne and Siriwardene Arachchilage Seelawathi,

Page 13 of 16

the 5th Deceased Defendant and the 6th Defendant, by Deed bearing No. 1902 dated

02.121976 marked as 53.

Therefore, it is noteworthy that the 5th Deceased Defendant and the 6th Defendant-

Respondent are entitled to 112 perches of the corpus sought to be partitioned. As

such, the learned District Judge has erroneously allocated only 43.04 perches to the

5th Deceased Defendant and the 6th Defendant-Respondent. Thus, it has to be

corrected as 112 perches.

Hence, we allow the appeal bearing No. 582/2000 (F) preferred by 5 Defendant

Appellants and amend the schedule of shares accordingly.

It is to be noted that the 4th Defendant-Appellant had preferred appeal bearing

No.584/2000(F) and sought to have the Judgment of the District Court set aside and

prayed to have the corpus partitioned among the parties according to the evidence

available in the instant case or to dismiss the plaint.

Court draws the attention to the petition of appeal preferred by the 4th Defendant-

Appellant. The 4th Defendant-Appellant has stated in paragraph 12 of the petition

that the original Plaintiff is not entitled to an undivided 21/48 share or 830.97

perches according to the documents tendered and the evidence adduced at the trial

and that the entire land has to be partitioned again and further stated that the 4th

Defendant-Appellant is entitled to more than 158.28 perches.

However, the 4th Defendant-Appellant had not substantiated the above position by

giving sufficient reasons in the argument and it is apparent that there is no merit in

his appeal.

Hence, we dismiss the appeal bearing No 584/2000(F) preferred by the 4th

Defendant-Appellant.

It was the contention of the 11th Defendant that the land described in the statement

of claim of the 11th Defendant was possessed by the predecessors and 11th Defendant

for more than 40 years and hence had claimed a prescriptive right.

Accordingly, the 11th Defendant in her statement of claim prayed inter alia;

(a) To dismiss the Plaintiffs action;

Page 14 of 16

(b) To exclude Lot No. 2, 13, 14, 15 depicted in Plan No. 278/84 dated 21.08.1984,

from the corpus subjected to the Partition action;

(c) If Court makes an Order to partition the said Lots, make an Order that 11th

Defendant is the owner to the Lot No. 2, 13, 14, 15 depicted in Plan No. 278/84

dated 21.08.1984,

At the trial, the 11th Defendant raised points of contest No. 29 to 31.

Attention of Court was drawn to Survey Plan No. 278/84 marked X and Survey Report

marked Y.

It is important to note that Lot No. 2 which the 11th Defendant is seeking an exclusion

from the corpus of this Partition action is situated in the northern side of the land

depicted in the Commission Plan. Further, between Lot No. 2 and 3 there is a

separate demarcation which is depicted as "Kambi and Pala Ini Weta". Lot No. 2 is

shown as 3A:1R:27P. Furthermore, in the Survey Report, the 1st Defendant has made

a claim that the entire plantation in Lot No. 2 is possessed by Amarasekara who is

the 11th Defendant.

It was submitted by the 11th Defendant-Appellant that the Survey Report and the

Survey plan substantiate the fact 11th Defendant and her predecessors have

separated Northern Part of MAWATHA YAYA WATTA as "divided Northern part of

MAWATHA YAYA WATTA" and had possessed as a defined and separate portion of

land from far back as 1949. Accordingly, the 11th Defendant has separated Lot No. 2

and has amalgamated with adjoining land called Valli Kanda Watta" and had

possessed as a defined and distinct portion of land.

It is observable that the learned District Judge while answering points of contest No.

31 and deciding Lot No.1 and 2 should not be excluded, nevertheless decided issue

No. 1 on the basis that corpus should consist of Lot Nos. 3,4,7,8,9, and 10. This

appears to contradict the above position. Since the learned District Judge

determined that the corpus consists of Lots 3,4,7,8,9 and 10, it is apparent that Lots

1,2,13, 14, 15 cannot be part of the corpus.

It is important to note that the learned District Judge considers the evidence of the

1st Defendant who had informed the surveyor that the 11th Defendant (Amerasekara)

Page 15 of 16

is claiming plantation on Lot No.2. It is relevant to note that the aforesaid evidence

has not been properly considered on the basis that it is "secondary evidence".

In view of the aforesaid reasons, it clearly manifests that the learned District Judge

had not considered the said Lot 2 claimed by the 11th Defendant as part of the

corpus. It is seen that none of the parties claimed Lot 2 before the survey and also

at the trial. However, the 11th Defendant had claimed Lot No.2 and also

substantiated that Lot No.02 had been possessed by the 11th Defendant as a defined

and distinct entity of the impugned corpus.

Therefore, it appears that the learned District Judge has erroneously answered point

of contest No. 31 by deciding Lot No.01 and Lot No.02 should not be excluded from

the corpus.

Since the 11th Defendants sought an exclusion of Lot 2,13,14,15 depicted in Plan

bearing No. 278/84 dated 21.08.1984, and the learned District Judge decided that

the corpus should consist of Lot No.3,4,7,8,9 and 10, it clearly shows that Lots No.

1,2,13,14,15 are not part of the corpus. The learned District Judge has excluded

only Lots 13, 14, 15. However, Lot.1 and 2 also should be excluded from the corpus.

As such, we direct the learned District Judge to exclude Lot.1 and 2 depicted in Plan

bearing No.278/84 dated 21.08.1984. Hence, we allow appeal No. 583/2000(F)

preferred by the 11th Defendant-Appellant.

Therefore, I hold that the corpus sought to be partitioned consists of Lots. 3,4,7,8,9

and 10 depicted in Plan bearing No. 278/84 dated 21.08.1984 marked as X and that

Lots 1,2,13,14 and 15 should be excluded from the corpus.

Hence, schedule of shares has to be amended as follows.

Original Plaintiff 830.97 P

1st Defendant 320.00 P

4th Defendant 158.00 P

5th Defendant 56.00 P

6th Defendant 56.00 P

7th Defendant - 297.08 P

8th Defendant 86.08 P

Page 16 of 16

Unallotted 118.81 P

(1/16 or 3/48 share, entitled to Punchi Manika)

In view of the aforesaid reasons, we allow appeal bearing No. 582/2000(F) and

583/2000(F) and dismiss appeal bearing No. 584/2000(F) with cost.
