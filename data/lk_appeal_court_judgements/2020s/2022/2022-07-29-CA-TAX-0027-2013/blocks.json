The Senior Assessor by letter dated 03.11.2009 (p. 67 of the TAC brief) separated the turnover of the Appellant from (i) business with SriLankan Airlines Ltd (Rs. 45,002,128); and (ii) business as tour operator (Rs. 23,865,068) and disallowed the concessionary rate of 0.5% for the Appellants business. The Assessor decided that the normal ECS rate of 1% would be applied as the Appellant is not an undertaking for the promotion of tourism under section 45 (1) (b) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006.

Webster's Dictionary defines the word \"include\" as synonymous with \"comprise\" or \"contain\".

In such case, the word include must be construed as comprehending, not only such things as they signify according to their natural import, but also those things which the interpretation clause declares that they shall include (Commissioner of Inland Tax v.

The TAC clearly erred in not considering the fact that the passengers who arrived in Sri Lanka on the SriLankan Layover Programme, may also leave the airport for accommodation in Hotels and undertake tours, up to a period of 1-14 days as per Annex 1, and such passengers are in fact tourists. The TAC completely disregarded the fact that those optional 1-14 day tours selected by the foreign passengers who arrive in Sri Lanka fall within the purview of the Sri Lankan Layover Programme set out in the Agreement.

The general rule in construing wills, statutes and written instruments is that the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, unless the words would lead to some absurdity, or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument. In such case, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified so as to avoid that absurdity or inconsistency, but no further [Grey v. Pearson (1857) 6 H.L. Cas. 61 at 1060].

(https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/handling-agent). As stated in paragraph 54, a travel agent may also function as a handling agent confirming and reconfirming services reserved by tour wholesalers such as return plane tickets, hotel booking, etc. But it does not make a travel agent a handling agent when interpreting the agreement as a whole where the rights and obligations of the parties and the surrounding circumstances demonstrate that the relationship falls within the scope of a travel agent. On the other hand, a tour operator who acts as a ground operatior/destination company can also act as a handling agent for providing personalized travel services to tourist as referred to in paragraph 54.",
