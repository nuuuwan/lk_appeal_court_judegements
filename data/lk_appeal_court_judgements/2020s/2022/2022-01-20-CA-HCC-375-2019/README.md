by using the motor lorry No 68-8243, an offence punishable in terms

(5) Causing injuries to one Dilani Champika in the same transaction by

using the same lorry, an offence punishable in terms of section 316 of

the Penal Code.

(6) Causing injuries to one Sarangage Nihal in the same transaction by

using the same lorry, an offence punishable in terms of section 316 of

the Penal Code.

All the above offences are said to have been committed on 13th April 2005 at a

place called Katukurunda.

After trial without a jury, the accused was found guilty as charged, and

sentenced accordingly by the learned High Court judge of Panadura.

At the hearing of the appeal, although the learned Counsel for the appellant

has urged several grounds of appeal in his written submissions, it was

informed that the following grounds of appeal will be pursued for the

consideration of the Court.

(1) The trial Court was in error when it failed to consider that PW-01

Nirmal Ajantha Gunawardena was not a reliable witness.

(2) The learned trial judge has failed to consider that the entire incident

was an accident and the accused appellant cannot be found guilty for

the charges in the indictment.

(3) The trial Court was in error when it shifted the burden of proof of

certain matters to the accused appellant, whereas the burden rests on

the prosecution.

Evidence in brief: -

After getting to know at around 9.30 pm in the day of the incident that his

sisters son Sameera was being assaulted by the brothers children of the

appellant, the PW-01 has gone towards the house where the incident was

happening along with his mother to meet the appellant in order to settle the

Page 4 of 11

matter and bring the mentioned Sameera back. The appellant was living near

the place of the incident and was well known to the witness and his mother as

they used to hire his lorry for their business activities. When they reached the

byroad, where the appellant lives, which was off the Colombo-Galle main road,

they have seen the appellant near his lorry parked on the road and after seeing

the PW-01, the son of appellants brother named Roshan has started to come

after him with a sword in his hand.

Through fear, PW01 has started running back towards the main road, but has

overheard the appellant calling the above-mentioned Roshan and his brother

who was also there, to get into the lorry. Looking back while running he has

seen the lorry coming after him. Reaching the main road, the witness has

stopped after seeing that the Police have arrived. He has seen the two Police

officers who were present, telling the people who gathered in the main road to

witness what was happening, to disperse. According to the witness, the

persons who gathered were on the left pavement side of the road towards

Panadura. He has then seen the lorry which was driven by the appellant

running over the people who were there, including the deceased and the

injured.

After running over, the lorry has gone towards Panadura without stopping.

Thereafter, the injured had been rushed to the hospital, but one of the Police

officers who came to inquire into the dispute could not be found at the scene of

the crime.

The evidence of all the injured have been consistent that they and the deceased

were standing on the left-hand side of the road and were by the side of the road

when the vehicle ran over them.

PW-19 IP Suranga Ranaweera was the duty officer of Panadura Police on 13th

April 2005. At 21.50 hours the appellant has come into the Police Station

without wearing any clothes in his upper body in a highly agitated state. He

has handed him a key, informing that he stopped the lorry on the road. It was

Page 5 of 11

his evidence that before he could go near the lorry which was parked on the

road, he was informed that there is a person entangled under the lorry. The

witness has taken steps to get the person released and has observed that he

was still alive. However, he has been informed by the hospital authorities that

he has passed away upon admission. Later he has come to know that the

person found entangled to the undercarriage of the lorry was a police constable

named Silva attached to Modara Police.

The Judicial Medical Officers who have given evidence in this case has

confirmed that the causes of death of the two deceased persons, namely, P

Nishantha Silva and G Wasantha Jayalal Silva and injuries to the four injured

persons were due to a road traffic accident.

When called for a defence at the conclusion of the prosecution case, the

appellant has made a statement from the dock. He has stated that he was

playing a game of cards with others at about 9.30 pm on the day of the

incident at his house. It was his statement that as his wife wanted him to go to

Luckysevenpura and pick her mother, and it was for that purpose he left his

house in his lorry. After reaching the main road and while proceeding towards

Panadura by the left lane of the road, he has seen a crowd of persons on the

pavement and when he reached that point about 25-30 persons fell on to the

road leaving no room for him to avoid collusion with them, although he

attempted to take the lorry to the right side of the road. He has stated that

although he initially stopped the vehicle, due to the fear of being assaulted he

left the place and went to the Panadura Police and informed what happened.

Grounds of Appeal: -

The main contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant is that this was

an unavoidable accident and not an intentional act, since there was no

animosity between the deceased and the injured. It was contended further that

the evidence of PW-01 was not credible in that regard.

Page 6 of 11

Another argument pursued by the learned Counsel for the appellant was that

since the learned trial judge has failed to analyze the charges against the

appellant separately, the judgment cannot be considered as a proper judgment

in terms of section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

It was the contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) for the

Attorney General that although the learned trial judge has used the word

at the commencement of his judgment, it is abundantly clear from

the judgment that all the charges against the appellant has been considered

separately. It was contended that the learned trial judge has not shifted the

burden to the appellant and he was well aware of the governing principles of

evidence when he considered the evidence in the judgment.

Relying on the judgment of Achala Wengappuli, J. in the case of A.W.Haprul

Asad and another Vs. The Attorney General C.A. Case No-91-2013 decided

on 21-06-2019 it was his contention that since this was a clear situation

where the actions of the appellant come within the 4th limb of section 294 of

the Penal Code, the judgment of the learned High Court judge should stand

affirmed.

First Ground of Appeal: -

The learned Counsel for the appellants contention that PW-01 was not a

credible witness appears to have been based on what he has said as to the

location of the roads and the distances when he gave evidence and what

happened when he and his mother went near the house of the appellant in

order to meet him. I find that due to the lengthy evidence in chief and cross

examination as to the locations of the roads and the distances, the witness has

been confused in giving his evidence. However, since the appellant had

admitted that it was the lorry driven by him that hit the deceased and the

injured, I am of the view that the mentioned infirmities have no relevance to

the facts in issue.

Page 7 of 11

PW-01 has not seen the initial incident where a relative of him was assaulted

and has not spoken about any involvement of the appellant to that incident.

What he has seen was the presence of the appellant near the parked lorry and

him driving towards him.

The evidence led in this action clearly establishes that the PW-01 and his

mother had gone to the place where the appellant resided in order to meet him

after hearing about a dispute the appellant's brothers children had with a

relative of PW-01. By the time they reached the place, the initial incident

appears to have been over. It is evident that PW-01 had to run back towards to

Colombo-Galle main road in order to avoid being assaulted. According to the

own admission of the appellant it was the lorry driven by him that crashed into

the people, including the Police officers who were on the pavement of the main

road, although it was his position that they fell onto the road.

I am unable to find any reason to find the evidence of PW-01 as not credible in

the given the circumstances, hence, I find no merit in the ground of appeal.

Second Ground of Appeal: -

It has been proved that the byroad from where the appellant entered the main

road was only a short distance away from the place of the incident. Hence, the

appellant ought to have had the clear knowledge that in all probabilities death

or serious injuries would occur to the people on the road when the lorry was

driven in the manner he did.

In his judgment the learned trial judge has considered the evidence based on

the intention to conclude that the appellant is guilty of murder. I am of the

view that even if one can argue that there was no intention on the part of the

appellant to commit murder, the appellant can still be found guilty based on

his knowledge as per the fourth limb of section 294 of the Penal Code as rightly

pointed out by the learned DSG and as the facts speaks for itself.

Page 8 of 11

The relevant provision of the Penal Code reads as follows;

294. Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is

murder-

Fourthly- If the person committing the act knows that it is so

imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause

death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and

commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of

causing death or such injury as aforesaid.

Dr. Gour, in his book Commentary on the Indian Penal Code (13th Edition)

at page 979 has stated that;

The clause Fourthly comprehends generally the commission of

imminently dangerous acts which must in all probability cause death or

cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. When such an act is

committed with the knowledge that death might be the probable result and

without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing the death or injury as

is likely to cause death, the offence is murder, this clause, speaking

generally, covers cases in which there is no intention to cause death of

anyone in particular.

As the fourth limb of section 294 of the Penal Code only speaks of the

knowledge, unlike the other three limbs of the section where it refers to the

intention of doing an act, the difference between the words intention and

knowledge needs to be looked at.

In the case of The King Vs. Rengasamy 25 NLR 438 the Court of Criminal

Appeal considering the above stated that;

Intention is a conscious and voluntary act of the mind. It consists in

desiring a particular result in formulating to oneself the physical means by

Page 9 of 11

which that result is to be achieved. The mental decision and the physical

act may be momentary, but the above factors must be present. Knowledge

on the other hand, is a mere passive condition of mind. It may or may not

be consciously present in the mind at the moment the act is done. intention

involves knowledge, and is frequently inferred from it. In cases where

knowledge of the nature of the act and its consequences are sufficient

for example, in the cases contemplated in the fourth paragraph of section

294 of the Penal Code, such knowledge is sufficient to constitute murder.

This paragraph does not apply to all cases of homicide. It relates only in to

cases of extreme rashness and disregard to human life. Illustration (d)

under this section shows what intended by the framers of the Code. This

is the only class of cases in which a man may be guilty of murder, even

though he might not have intended the death of his victim. In all other

cases intention is an essential requisite of murder under our Code. Where

knowledge is imputed to the accused as a legal fiction, intention should not

be argued from it.

The evidence led in the instant action has clearly established that the vehicle

driven by the appellant had all the possibilities of avoiding the persons who

were on the left-hand side of the road being hit. The appellant has shown no

regard for the human life when he crashed onto the group of persons who

apparently had no connection to the initial incident. He should have had the

knowledge of the possible result of a person being hit by a vehicle like a lorry

driven by him. This has resulted in the deaths of two individuals, including one

of the Police officers who was present and injuries to four others. The appellant

as an experienced driver should have clear knowledge that somebody who was

hit by his vehicle being dragged on when he fled the place of the incident

towards Panadura. When IP Ranaweera of Panadura Police inspected the

vehicle, he has observed that the person entangled was still alive, which means

that had he stopped the vehicle after the incident his life may have been saved.

Page 10 of 11

This act itself establishes the scant disregard the appellant has shown to

human life.

The excuse given by the appellant for the incident was that when he was

passing the place of the incident the persons who were on the payment fell into

his path and he had no time to avoid them being hit, cannot be considered a

valid excuse. His position was that he was only driving to bring his mother-in-

law from a place little distance away. The evidence clearly establishes that the

lorry had entered the main road from a very short distance away from the place

of the incident. Under the circumstances, if the vehicle was being driven in the

normal manner as claimed, the speed of the vehicle would have to be much

less given the distance from which it entered the main road and the place of

the incident.

It is therefore clear that the actions of the appellant were without any excuse

for incurring the risk of causing of such injury, hence, I find no merit in the

second ground of appeal.

Third Ground of Appeal: -

There cannot be any argument that in a criminal case the burden of proof of its

case beyond reasonable doubt is with the prosecution and the accused has to

prove nothing.

It is abundantly clear from the judgment that the learned trial judge was well

possessed of the relevant legal principles that should be considered, and in fact

has considered the evidence on the basis that whether a reasonable

explanation has been provided or a reasonable doubt has arisen on the

evidence of the prosecution.

I find that the learned High Court judge in the process of considering the

defence put forward by the appellant has commented that his failure to call the

persons whom the prosecution witness claimed that travelled in the vehicle, as

relevant under section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance. This was a misdirection.

Page 11 of 11

However, it is my view that the mentioned misdirection has not caused any

prejudice to the appellant as the conviction has been based on the evidence of

the prosecution and not on the failures of the appellant.

Although it was contended by the learned Counsel for the appellant that the

learned High Court judge has failed to analyze the six counts preferred against

the appellant separately, I am in no position to agree with the contention. As

pointed out correctly by the learned DSG, even though the learned high Court

judge has used the word , that does not mean that the evidence has

been considered on the basis of a single charge against the appellant.

It is very much clear that the incident where the deceased received fatal

injuries and the four injured persons received their injuries have had happened

within a short span of few milliseconds apart and at the same time. As such, it

is impossible for a trial judge to compartmentalize the evidence in order to

analyze against each of the counts separately. I find that the learned High

Court judge has analyzed the evidence as he should have in a case of this

nature and has come to his findings with reasoning, which warrants no

interference from this Court. In view of the above, I find no basis for the third

ground of appeal either.

The appeal therefore is dismissed, as I find no merit. The conviction and the

sentence affirmed.
