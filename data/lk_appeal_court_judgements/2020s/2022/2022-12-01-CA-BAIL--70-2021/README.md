The instant matter has been filed under the of the Provisions of

Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Act

No. 4 of 2015.

Counsel for the Accused stated that although indictment has been filed

in the substantive matter the Accused has been in remand since his date

of arrest without the trial being taken up, and in addition to that the

Accused is suffering from a heart condition in which it has been brought

to the notice of Court that his left coronary artery is 95% blocked. This

submission is substantiated by medical report submitted under the hand

of consultant cardiologist from the National Hospital of Kandy.

The DSG appearing in this matter objected to this application on the

basis that the Accused initially had been absconding from High Court

and thereafter trial had been fixed to be taken in his absence, upon the

warrant being issued the Accused had been taken into custody and

produced before the High Court and he had been remanded. Therefore,

the DSG urged that he had been remanded in order to make sure that

he appears to face the trial, but if he is enlarged on bail he might

abscond as per his previous conduct. Therefore, the learned DSG

differentiated facts of this case from other cases because of the warrant

issued against the Accused and invited Court to consider this matter

accordingly.

As per the law pertaining to the above mentioned Act when an Accused

is arrested and charged under the instant Act they can be enlarged on

bail only upon exceptional circumstances by the Court of Appeal. The

term exceptional has not been defined in the statute but in the cases so

Page 4 of 5

far decided it had been decided that the term exceptional differs from

case to case.

In the instant matter the Accused has been absconding from Court and

the learned High Court Judge has issued a warrant against him and the

police had arrested him and produced before Court. But the learned

High Court Judge has used his discretion and has remanded the accused

in all likelihood to ensure the presence of the accused during the trial.

But at present the Counsel for the accused has placed before Court the

health condition of the accused which had been substantiated by

medical reports.

In reply to this medical condition the learned Counsel for the

respondents stated that the High Court has directed the prison

authorities to facilitate the accused to obtain the necessary treatment.

But upon consideration of the medical reports submitted it appears that

the accused needs specialized treatment which we consider is a

circumstance which can be considered as exceptional.

Hence this Court is of the view that it is only but fair to enlarge the

accused on bail and we direct the learned High Court Judge to enlarge

the accused on suitable conditions of bail.

As such the instant application for bail is allowed.
