JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred as the Appellant)

was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of Colombo under

Sections 54A (d) and 54A (b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance as amended by Act No.13 of 1984 for the Trafficking and

Possession of respectively 3.29 grams of Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) on 14th

November 2013.

After trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the Learned

High Court Judge of Colombo has imposed a sentence of life imprisonment

on the 14th of October 2020.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the

Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the

Covid 19 pandemic. During the argument he has been connected via Zoom

platform from prison.

3 | P a g e

The Learned Presidents Counsel, even though he raised 09 grounds of

appeals in his written submissions restricted his argument to the following

04 grounds of appeal.

1. That the learned trial Judge has not considered the failure on the

part of the prosecution to prove the charge under Section 54A (b)

(Trafficking) and the lack of corroborative evidence to support such a

charge.

2. That the learned trial Judge had failed to appreciate the

inconsistency between the evidence provided by PW1 and PW2 as to

how they discovered the identity and/ or alias of the Appellant.

3. That the learned trial Judge has failed to properly evaluate the dock

statement and the evidence put forward by the Defence in

accordance with legal principles.

4. That the Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that the chain of

custody had not been proved beyond reasonable grounds.

At the trial, PW1 IP/Chandana, PW2 IP/Wasantha Kumara, PW9 PC

47316/Jansz, PW10 PS 27675/Ramyakumara and PW11 Government

Analyst Mrs. Jayasekera were called by the prosecution to give evidence.

The Appellant made a dock statement and called his mother as defence

witness.

Background of the case

According to PW1, he was the Officer-In-Charge of the Western Province

Anti-Corruption Unit which functioned under the Colombo Crime Division.

On 14/11/2013, while he was engaged in his usual daily official duties, he

had gone to Maligawatte with a team of police officers to detect illegal

substances and to raid brothel houses functioning in that area. He had

used a white coloured van for this purpose. They had gone to Kettarama

and parked their vehicle in front of the R. Premadasa Cricket Stadium.

4 | P a g e

PW1 who was clad in police uniform and was seated at the front had

noticed a person approaching them whilst glancing backwards. As his

movement seemed to be suspicious, PW1 had apprehended the person

before he could pass the front of the vehicle where he was seated. With the

assistance of the other officers the person was searched and a pink

coloured cellophane bag was recovered from the right-side pocket of the

pants worn by the said person.

When the cellophane bag was checked by PW1 some brown coloured

substance was found which he identified as Heroin relying on his

experience in dealing with narcotics. The Appellant was taken into custody

immediately for further investigation.

During inquiry, the persons name was found to be Muniyandi Upul

Chandima alias Konda Chaminda from Kettarama area. He is the Appellant

in this case.

The recovered substance was taken for weighing to the Dedigama Pawning

Centre, Dematagoda. The weight of the substance with the cellophane bag

had been 15.21 grammes. PW1 had sealed the production and handed it

over to the reserve police officer PW9 PC 47316 Jansz at 1600 hrs.

According to the Government Analyst Report 3.29 grammes of pure Heroin

(diacetylmorphine) had been detected from the substance which was

subjected for analysis.

When the prosecution had closed the case after leading the prosecution

witnesses mentioned above, the defence was called, and the Appellant had

made a dock statement and called his mother as his witness.

Considering the grounds of appeal advanced by the Appellant, I regard it

appropriate to consider the second ground of appeal first.

5 | P a g e

In the second ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the learned

Trial Judge had failed to appreciate the inconsistency between the evidence

given by PW1 and PW2 as to how they discovered the identity and or alias

of the Appellant.

According to PW1 the appellant was arrested randomly without any prior

information. In his evidence he has categorically stated that the identity of

the appellant was revealed only after his arrest. Hence, it was the position

of PW1 that the Appellant is a stranger to him at the time of the arrest.

On this point, upon examination of the evidence given by PW2, he had

stated that the identity with alias name of the Appellant was intimated to

the police team by PW1 IP/Chandana who had headed the team. This is a

very contradictory position taken by PW1 and PW2.

In the cross examination PW2 has given evidence as follows:

(Cross examination of PW 2 IP/Vasantha Kumara at Pages 167 to 168 of the

Appeal Brief)

The last answer of PW2 mentioned above is very clear that the Appellant

had not mentioned his name but it was intimated to PW2 only by PW1.

Hence, as rightly claimed by the Learned Presidents Counsel this

contradictory position with regard to the identity of the Appellant creates a

serious doubt in this case.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person. In a case of this

nature, the prosecution needs to not only prove the case beyond reasonable

doubt with cogent and believable evidence sans any contradictions or

omissions but should also ensure that the arrest, detection, weighing and

sending the substance for analysis is conducted with accordance to due

process which will otherwise affect the root of the case.

In Iswari Prasad v. Mohamed Isa 1963 AIR (SC) 1728 at 1734 His

Lordship held that;

In considering the question as to whether evidence given by the

witness should be accepted or not, the court has, no doubt, to examine

whether the witness is, an interested witness and to enquire whether

the story deposed to by him is probable and whether it has been

8 | P a g e

shaken in cross-examination. That is whether there is a ring of truth

surrounding his testimony.

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 Denning J in the

Kings Bench held that:

The evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required in

a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree

is well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high

degree of probability

In this case although PW1 claimed that he did not possess any prior

knowledge regarding the identity of the Appellant, PW2 in his evidence very

clearly stated that the Appellants name and alias name was intimated to

him by PW1. This is a very serious inter se contradiction between

important prosecution witnesses. Further, this inter se contradiction raises

very serious questions as to the credibility of the so-called detection.

The effect of a valid and serious contradiction in a criminal trial has been

discussed in several judicial decisions. A Contradiction which affects the

root of the case will certainly overturn the original decision pronounced by

the trial court. The appellate court will not encourage the provision of a

second chance to the prosecution to rectify the ambiguity created by the

police investigators in a case of this nature.

In Udagama v. AG [2000] 2 SLR 103 the court held that;

Material questions and contradictions go to the very root of the

prosecution case.

9 | P a g e

In the Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa [2011] 2 SLR

292 the court held that:

Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect

the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that

the Court must exercise its judgment on the nature of the inconsistency

or contradiction and whether they are material to the fact in issue.

The Learned High Court Judge had not properly evaluated this inter se

contradiction in his judgment. The Learned Presidents Counsel has

pointed out that the Learned Trial Judge in his judgment had addressed

the inconsistency in paragraph 20 of the judgment as follows:

.

(Paragraph 20 of the Judgment-page 227-228 of the brief)

This clearly shows, as contended by the Learned Presidents Counsel that

the Learned High Court has gone beyond evaluating the evidence that had

been led before him and has arrived at his own conclusion which is not

supported by the evidence that was led in the trial. It shows that he arrived

at the decision on his assumption.

When the appellant satisfactorily proves that an inter se contradiction

affects the root of the prosecution case, the court has no option but to

award the benefit of that doubt to the Appellant. Therefore, I conclude that

this ground of appeal has merit and afford the benefit of the doubt to the

Appellant accordingly.

10 | P a g e

Next, I will consider the third ground of appeal advanced by the Appellant.

In that ground the Appellant complains that the learned trial Judge has

failed to properly evaluate the dock statement and the evidence put forward

by the Defence in accordance with legal principles.

The Appellant had denied that he was arrested outside the main gate of the

R. Premadasa International Stadium in Maligawatte, and had contended

that he was arrested at his residence which is situated 50-70 meters away

from the stadium by PW1 and another officer. When he was taken under

their arrest, they had inquired about Sri Prabha who is the brother-in-law

of the Appellant. At that time his mother had also been at home.

When he replied that he was unaware of the whereabouts of his brother-in-

law, his house was searched and he was taken to the Kotahena Police

Station to obtain his recorded statement. After keeping him there till 3.00

p.m. on 14/11/2013, he was taken to Colombo Crime Division and a false

case had been instituted upon planting a package of Heroin on him. This

position had been put to PW1 in his cross examination by the defence

counsel during the trial.

In Samantha Jayamaha v. Attorney General CA Appeal 303/2006 and

C.A.L.A. 321/2006 decided on 11/07/2012 the court held that:

Even if the dock statement is rejected the burden always remains on

the prosecution of proving the case against the accused, beyond

reasonable doubt Whether the evidence of the defence or the dock

statement is sufficient to create a doubt cannot be decided in a

vacuum or in isolation because it needs to be considered in the totality

of the evidence that is in the light of the evidence for the prosecution as

well as the defence Finally, having considered the case for the

prosecution as well as the dock statement it is only then the learned

11 | P a g e

Judge can decide whether or not the dock statement is sufficient to

create a doubt in the case for the prosecution.

In Udagama v. AG [2000] 2 SLR 103 the court held that:

(1) Evidence is infirm, unsafe and unreliable to act upon

considering the following, (iii) failure to evaluate and consider the dock statement of accused.

Test of reasonable doubt plays a wide role when evaluation of the defence

evidence. The evidence of the Appellant may be not so convincing yet it may

be capable of creating a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case.

Hence, I agree that the failure to properly consider the dock statement of

the Appellant as argued by the learned Presidents Counsel raises a

reasonable doubt on the prosecution story.

The Appellants mother Leelawathie giving evidence on behalf of the defence

confirmed that the police officers had come to her house on the date of

arrest of the Appellant, searched the house and taken the Appellant to the

Colombo Crime Division to record a statement. According to her the

Appellant was wearing only a sarong when the police apprehended him and

he did not have anything in his possession when he was taken away by the

police. Her evidence was not subjected to cross examination by the

prosecution.

In Indrasena & Wimalasena v. Attorney General [2008] CA No. 135/2003

decided on 10.06.2008 Sisira de Abrew J. held that;

Whenever the evidence given by a witness on a material point is not

challenged in cross examination, it has to be concluded that such

evidence is not disputed and is accepted by the opponent.

12 | P a g e

In Sarwan Singh v. State of Punjab [2002] Appeal (crl.) 480 of 2001

decided on 07/10/2002 the Indian Supreme Court held that:

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has

declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross-

examination it must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue

ought to be accepted.

As the defence witnesss evidence has not been challenged or rebutted, the

only conclusion the court should arrive at is that the stance taken by the

Appellant in his dock statement had been properly corroborated through

his witness.

The single most important criterion in evaluating the fairness of a trial is

the observance of the principle of equality of arms between the defence and

the prosecution. Equality of arms, which must be observed throughout the

trial, means that both parties are treated in a manner ensuring their

procedurally equal position during the course of a trial.

When the defence evidence creates a reasonable doubt on the prosecution

case, the benefit of the same should be given to the Appellant. Hence, this

ground of appeal also has merit.

As the considered grounds of appeal two and three have merits which

certainly disturb the judgment of the learned High Court Judge, it is not

necessary to address the remaining grounds in this appeal.

The failure of the witnesses to pass the test of probability and the inter se

contradictions of the prosecution witnesses are substantial enough to

vitiate the conviction.

Due to the aforesaid reasons, I set aside the conviction and the sentence

dated 14/10/2020 imposed on the Appellant by the learned High Court

Judge of Colombo. Therefore, he is acquitted from both charges.

13 | P a g e

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

I greatly appreciate and thank both the counsels for assisting this court by

filing comprehensive and helpful written submissions.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court

of Colombo along with the original case record.
