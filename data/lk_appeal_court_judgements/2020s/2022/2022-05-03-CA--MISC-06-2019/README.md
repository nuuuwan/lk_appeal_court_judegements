JUDGMENT

Parties agreed to abide by the judgement of MIS-0005-19.

This Appeal is against the decision of the University Appeals Board [U.A.B.] dated 28.06.2019. The

Appellant-Respondent had appealed to the University Appeals Board that she was holding a position

as an Assistant Lecturer (Probation) at the National Institute of Technical Education of Sri Lanka

established under Act No.59 of 1998 prior to the repeal of the said Act by the University of

Vocational Technology Act No.31 of 2008.

At the transition, she informed the 1st Appellant University that she would accept employment in

the new University if employment were offered. The interim committee appointed under the Act

No.31 of 2008 had offered to employ her as a Teaching Assistant in Management studies in the

first Appellant University she had accepted. At the time of her being absorbed by the 1st Appellant,

she had qualifications to be appointed as Lecturer. Therefore, the decision to appoint her as a

teaching Assistant in Management studies was ultra vires.

She had further claimed that she was entitled to be appointed to the post of Lecturer with effect from

12.10.2009 and senior Lecturer Grade II with effect from 01.06.2012. After entertaining the

Appellant and the Respondent, the Interim Committee delivered a split decision. Two members held

that the appeal should be allowed with back wages allowances and other promotional prospects. One

member, the Chairman of the Interim Committee, delivered a separate decision refusing to grant the

Page 8 of 11

reliefs claimed by the Appellant. This decision was made on 28.06.2019. The Respondent-Appellant

pleads that the majority decision on 28.06.2019 to be set aside.

The University of Vocational Technology was established by an Act of Parliament, namely Act

No.31 of 2008. According to Section 68 (1) of the Officers and servants of the National Institute of

Technical Education of Sri Lanka (N.I.T.E.S.L.) who were in service were given time to express

their decision regarding whether or not they were agreeable to accept the employment in the new

University. The Appellant-Respondent had joined the National Institute of Technical Education of

Sri Lanka [N.I.T.E.S.L.] on 01.12.2005 as an academic Assistant subject to a three-year probation

period. By letter dated 28.01.2009, the Director-General of National Institute of Technical Education

of Sri Lanka [N.I.T.E.S.L.] had informed the Appellant-Respondent that she had completed her

probation period and will be absorbed to the permanent carder from 01.12.2005. It further states that

she should be absorbed to the same post she served during the probation period, namely the position

of Educational Assistant.

On 07.04.2008, she was appointed as an Assistant Lecturer (Probation) by a letter signed by the

Director-General of the National Institute of Technical Education of Sri Lanka [N.I.T.E.S.L.]. In

perusing the said letter, conditions are to be fulfilled one year as the probation period. Paragraph 4

of the said letter reads: Your post may be made permanent .. When one uses the word may

there is no finality that even if you fulfil all the requested requirements, there is no assurance that

you will get absorbed into the permanent carder.

In Gibson v Manchester City Council [1979] 1 All ER 972, the Council sent Gibson a document

which asked him to make a formal invitation to buy and stated that the Council may be prepared to

sell the house to him. Gibson signed the document and returned it. The House of Lords held that a

contract had not been concluded because the Council had not made an offer capable of being

accepted. Lord Diplock stated that the words may be prepared to sell are fatal so is the invitation,

not, be it noted, to accept the offer, but to make formal application to buy. It is very important to

realise from the outset that not all communications will be offers. They will lack the requisite

intention to be bound upon acceptance.

Even though the same letter refers to a probation period of one year and extension of the probation

period only on justifiable reason in the 2nd paragraph, nowhere in the letter refers to an

Page 9 of 11

absorbing into permanent carder as of a right. What it refers to that they may or may not absorb.

Therefore, even though one concludes the one year until the Board of Directors confirms by a letter,

the Appellant-Respondent will not be a permanent staff member.

According to the Appellant-Respondent six months, after the probation period was completed again,

she was employed as a Teaching Assistant on 12.10.2009. She was given a probation period as an

Assistant lecturer during that period. The University of Vocational Technology Act No. 31 of 2008

came into operation. By that Act National Institute of Technical Education of Sri Lanka

[N.I.T.E.S.L.] transformed into a university. The Act had stipulated how the staff absorption would

take place. The operation date was 15.10.2008, which was within the one year of probation of the

Respondent-Appellant.

Therefore, she concludes her one year after the transition of the institute by which she was employed,

subject to a probation period. Her confirmation as a permanent member must be communicated to

the new organisation. She has no right to believe that she will be absorbed automatically. With the

word May in paragraph 4 of the letter of appointment, even though the probation period was

extended verbally until she is served with a letter of appointment as a permanent member, she

remains subject to the probation period. The National Institute of Technical Education of Sri Lanka

(N.I.T.E.S.L.) had kept its discretion to employ or not to employ as a permanent member when using

the word May instead of shall.

The National Institute of Technical Education of Sri Lanka (N.I.T.E.S.L.) was never a university.

When it became a university offering degrees, it had to upgrade the standard of the University tutorial

staff to be compatible with University Grants Committee (U.G.C.) requirements. Therefore, the

qualifications to be a lecturer were for more than before. To be appointed as an Assistant Lecturer,

one should have postgraduate qualifications of at least two academic years with a research

component. The Appellant-Respondent had not shown that she had acquired this qualification.

Once again, in perusing Section 68 (2) of Act No. 31 of 2008, it gave directions on absorbing

employees and servants to the University. The Appellant-Respondent had pointed out a statutory

direction given to the Interim Committee to employ on terms not favourable than the terms of

employment in the National Institute of Technical Education of Sri Lanka (N.I.T.E.S.L.).

Page 10 of 11

As she was an Assistant Lecturer attached to the National Institute of Technical Education of Sri

Lanka (N.I.T.E.S.L.), she should be appointed to a similar position and not a non-academic staff

member. To prove that she was an Assistant Lecturer (Probation) (Management/Business studies)

document marked as [X] was produced. As discussed earlier, that letter itself had said, your post

may be made permanent on a date decided by the management by the institute. The salary is

spoken in paragraph 3, which says that salary will be paid during the probation period. Paragraph

five of the letter has kept the right to terminate the service without giving reasons, notification or

compensation. Even though that paragraph spoke of reason such as service, conduct and attendance,

which they will look for in the decision to terminate the probation period, the very fact which says

reasons will not be given or a chance to explain means that such termination cannot be questioned.

It further affirms that she remains a person serving a probation period until she was served with a

letter of appointment as a permanent member. Therefore, at the time of absorbing the staff of the

National Institute of Technical Education of Sri Lanka (N.I.T.E.S.L. her position was of a person

serving a probation period and not of a permanent member.

Therefore, Section 68 (2) of Act No. 31 of 2008 does not apply to her as a permanent member, which

reads as .... shall be employed on terms not less favourable than their terms of employment in

the institute.

Therefore, she was offered a position as a Teaching Assistant in Management Studies on 01.10.2009,

which was accepted on 29.10.2009. The moment she accepts the appointment, she is estopped from

challenging the appointment. She was free to decide and question or seek legal remedies that would

not stand in her favour now.

The next question the Appellant-Respondent had stressed is regarding the salary structure, which

she says prove that she was a permanent member of the National Institute of Technical Education of

Sri Lanka (N.I.T.E.S.L.).

This need not be gone into as she was not a permanent employee. What a probation period means

and/or how it terminates are not questions to be argued or decided in the present case. Those matters

Page 11 of 11

could have been considered had she not accepted the letter of appointment dated 01.10.2009

appointing her as a Teaching Assistant.

For reasons discussed above, I allow the Appeal of the Respondent-Appellant-Petitioner. I make no

order for costs.
