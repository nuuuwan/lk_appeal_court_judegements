The Petitioner states that the title to the land has devolved on him in terms of section 72 of the Land Development Ordinance read with the 3rd schedule of the ordinance. The Petitioner had written several times to the 1st Respondent to get the grant transferred to the Petitioner and as a result the Petitioner was summoned several times to the Divisional Secretariat at Weeraketiya. The Petitioner states that the 1st Respondent and his predecessors delayed issuing the grant in Petitioners favour. Thereafter, the Petitioner had written to the District Secretary Hambantota and also placed his grievance before the member of Parliament in the area. The Parliamentary Committee for Land and Land Development having considered the Petitioners Complaint had decided to issue the grant in Petitioners favour. Thereafter 1st and 2nd Respondents had held an inquiry regarding the matter and the 2nd Respondent by his letter marked P6 had decided to issue the grant to the 4th Respondent. The Petitioner states that that decision is illegal, unlawful, malicious, wrongful and arbitrary. The Petitioner states that the 2nd Respondent had come to the wrong conclusion that the grant had been issued to the Petitioners father after his death. The Petitioners father died after the grant was issued to him.",

The learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the 1st 3rd Respondents supported that contention. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the nomination made under the permit marked 1R1 is not a valid nomination as contemplated by section 58 (1) of the land Development Ordinance as it has not been registered by the Registrar of Lands of the District. The learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that the nomination was registered in the land ledger in the Divisional Secretariat and that is sufficient for the purpose.
