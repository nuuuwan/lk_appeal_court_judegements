C. P. Kirtisinghe J.

The Petitioner is seeking for a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 2nd Respondent contained in the document marked P6 and for a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to hold a fresh inquiry to select the grantee.

By the letter marked P6, the 2nd Respondent had requested the 1st Respondent to regularize the grant in dispute in favour of the 4th Respondent.

The Petitioner and the 4th Respondent are brothers and according to the Petitioner their father had come into possession of the land in dispute in 1960 and developed it and cultivated it as a paddy field since then. In 1967 a permit for the land was issued to Petitioners father. On 30.08.1996 a grant in terms of section 19 (4) of the Land Development Ordinance was issued to the father. The father passed away in 1997. The widow of the original permit holder/ the mother of the Petitioner and 4th and 5th Respondents had passed away in 2006. The Petitioner states that the title to the land has devolved on him in terms of section 72 of the Land Development Ordinance read with the 3rd schedule of the ordinance. The Petitioner had written several times to the 1st Respondent to get the grant transferred to the Petitioner and as a result the Petitioner was summoned several times to the Divisional Secretariat at Weeraketiya. The Petitioner states that the 1st Respondent and his predecessors delayed issuing the grant in Petitioners favour. Thereafter, the Petitioner had written to the District Secretary Hambantota and also placed his grievance before the member of Parliament in the area. The Parliamentary Committee for Land and Land Development having considered the Petitioners Complaint had decided to issue the grant in Petitioners favour. Thereafter 1st and 2nd Respondents had held an inquiry regarding the matter and the 2nd Respondent by his letter marked P6 had decided to issue the grant to the 4th Respondent. The Petitioner states that that decision is illegal, unlawful, malicious, wrongful and arbitrary. The Petitioner states that the 2nd Respondent had come to the wrong conclusion that the grant had been issued to the Petitioners father after his death. The Petitioners father died after the grant was issued to him.

The Petitioner states that the 2nd Respondent had failed to appreciate the following grounds when he took the decision.

1. The grant was issued to the Petitioners father before his death.

4

2. The original grantee had not nominated any successor after grant was

issued. 3. No nomination has been registered in the relevant folio. 4. A nomination made prior to the issuing of the grant has no effect. 5. The title to the land has devolved on the Petitioner in terms of section 72

of the Land Development Ordinance.

The Petitioner states that he is cultivating a portion of the land.

The 1st 3rd Respondents in their statement of objections state that the fact that the Petitioner is the eldest son of the original permit holder is irrelevant to the matter before court. The permit marked 1R1 was issued to Dines Hamy (father of the Petitioner and the 4th Respondent) in respect of this land in 1967 and the 4th Respondent who was a son of the permit holder was nominated as the successor to the land. A certified copy of the relevant extract of the land ledger has been annexed marked 1R2. The Respondents state that in view of the fact that the nomination made by Dines Hamy had not been cancelled prior to Dines hamys death, the said nomination of the 4th Respondent remained valid for the purpose of succession to the grant.

By the letter marked P6 the 2nd Respondent had taken up a decision and come to the conclusion that the 4th Respondent is the lawful successor of Dines Hamy. He had also come to the conclusion that the nomination which is already there in the land ledger is still in force. He had conveyed his decision to the 1st Respondent and requested the 1st Respondent to act accordingly. The Respondents had not taken up the position that there is no decision contained in P6. The 2nd Respondent has come to the conclusion that as the nomination made by Dines Hamy under the permit marked 1R1 and registered in the land ledger as shown in 1R2 is still valid the 4th Respondent (the nominee under the permit) is the lawful successor of Dines Hamy. The learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the 1st 3rd Respondents supported that contention. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the nomination made under the permit marked 1R1 is not a valid nomination as contemplated by section 58 (1) of the land Development Ordinance as it has not been registered by the Registrar of Lands of the District. The learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that the nomination was registered in the land ledger in the Divisional Secretariat and that is sufficient for the purpose. The relevant ledger has been produced marked 1R2.

Section 58 (1) of the Land Development Ordinance reads as follows;

5

A document (other than a last will) whereby the nomination of a successor is effected or cancelled shall not be valid unless and until it has been registered by the Registrar of Lands of the district in which the holding or land to which that document refers is situated.

Section 60 of the Land Development Ordinance reads as follows;

No nomination or cancellation of the nomination of a successor shall be valid unless the document (other than a last will) effecting such nomination or cancellation is duly registered before the date of the death of the owner of the holding or the permit holder.

Section 58 (1) states that a nomination of a successor shall not be valid until and unless it has been registered by the Registrar of Lands of the district in which the land to which the document refers is situated. Section 60 states that a nomination of a successor shall not be valid unless it is duly registered before the death of the owner or the permit holder of the holding.

The learned counsel for the Petitioner cited several authorities. He has cited the judgement of Palate Gedara Gunadasa Vs Palate Gedara Marywathie CA Writ/556/2010 decided on 15.07.2015 and the judgement of Ratnayake Mudiyanselage Gunaratne Vs V.U.K. Agalawatta Divisional Secretary, Buttala and 4 others CA Writ/406/2011 decided on 18.03.2013. Both those cases had dealt with the interpretation of section 60 of the ordinance. In the 1st case it was held that a cancellation of a nomination must be registered before the death of the permit holder. In the 2nd case it was held that a nomination of a successor must be registered before the death of the owner of the holding or the permit holder. Those two cases are not applicable to the situation before us. In the judgement of Madurasinghe Vs Madurasinghe 1988 (2) SLR 142 also it was held that a nomination should be registered before the death of the permit holder. In the case of S.C. Appeal No. 82/2008, S.C. (H.C.) C.A.L.A. No. 47/2008, NCP (Anuradhapura) HC CA/ARP 36/2007, D.C. Polonnaruwa No. 6330/L decided on 26.10.2010 also dealt with section 60 of the ordinance and it was held that a nomination is not valid unless registered before the death of the nominator.

The judgement of G. Ranjith Vs M.A.A.S. Nissanka Arachchi, the Divisional Secretary, Hingurakgoda and others CA/Writ Application No. 453/2013 decided on 10.10.2016 is a case which dealt with section 58 of the Ordinance. In that case Surasena J. has observed as follows;

Thus, the law is very clear on this point i.e., the nomination has to be made in the prescribed form and be registered in the Land Registry in terms of section 58 of the Land Development Ordinance and if it is not registered such nomination is considered to be invalid.

In the case of Piyasena Vs Wijesinghe and others 2002 (2) SLR 242 J.A.N. De Silva J. had observed as follows;

It is to be noted that in terms of the Land Development Ordinance, a permit holder is entitled to nominate a person or persons to succeed to the ownership of the land after his/her death. Such nomination could be cancelled by the permit holder and a new nomination could be made in terms of the provisions in chapter VII of the Land Development Ordinance. The nomination has to be made in the prescribed form and registered in the Land Registry in terms of section 58 of the Land Development Ordinance and if it is not registered such nomination is considered to be invalid (vide section 58(1)). The nomination in the permit itself shall stand valid until it is cancelled by the permit holder.

Both those judgements refer to the requirement of registration in the Land Registry.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General has drawn our attention to the fact that section 60 of the Ordinance only refers to registration and it does not refer to the registration at the Land Registry. But section 60 has to be read with section 58. What is referred to in section 60 is the registration contemplated in section 58 and section 58 requires the registration by the Registrar of Land of the district.

Land Order 148 of the Land Manual reads as follows;

, . - . . .

Order 01 reads as follows;

7

, . .

Those Land Orders prescribed by the Land Manual, including the order 148 are not regulations made under the Land Development Ordinance but mere procedural guidelines which cannot override the express statutory provisions of the Land Development Ordinance. Chapter VII of the Land Development Ordinance which deals with succession does not refer to a registration in the land ledger kept at the Divisional Secretariat. Section 58 only refers to a registration by the Registrar of Lands of the District in which the land to which the permit/ grant refers is situated.

For the aforesaid reasons we are of the view that the nomination of the 4th Respondent as the successor of the original permit holder is invalid for the reason that it was not properly registered by the Registrar of Lands of the district as required by section 58 of the Ordinance.

The learned counsel for the 4th and 5th Respondents has drawn our attention to the judgement of Piyasena Vs Wijesinghe and others 2002 (2) SLR 242. In that case it was held that the issuance of a grant changes the status of a permit holder to that of an owner who derives title to the land in question and the nomination of a successor under the permit becomes converted to nomination made by her as the owner of the land. But for such a conversion there should be a valid nomination.

For the aforementioned reasons we are of the view that the decision of the 2nd Respondent contained in the document P6 is unlawful and ultra vires. Therefore, we issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing that decision. We also issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to hold a proper inquiry to select a grantee.

We make no order for costs.
