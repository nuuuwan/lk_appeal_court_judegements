MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to obtain bail to the suspect namely

Polahena Jayasinghe Tahnthitrige Sudarshini under the provisions of the

Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act.

The Counsel for the suspect stated that the suspect and six others were produced

before the Magistrate of Galle for causing mischief and grievous hurt on 30.5.2022

and had been remanded. But on 4.7.2022 the Magistrate had been informed that

action would be considered under the provisions of the above mentioned act as

such bail had been refused to the instant suspect.

The grievance of the Counsel for the suspect was that the 2nd respondent reported

facts under the instant act in order to keep the suspect in remand and he quoted

the example of the petitioner to this application who is the husband of the suspect

who had been once produced for the same offence and later released for lack of

evidence. This Court also observes that on 27.6.2022 the petitioner and the 2nd and

the 5th suspects have been granted bail but it had been cancelled once facts had

been reported under the instant act. Therefore, the Counsel for the suspect further

said that the provisions of the instant act have been used for the purpose of

implicating the wrong person in order to overcome personal grievances. Upon

perusing of the case record also we observe that the same submission has been

made before the Magistrate as well but the Magistrate has cited the law pertaining

to the instant matter and had refused bail.

The Counsel for the respondents vehemently objected to the application and said

that, the suspects Counsel by asking for bail before investigation are over and if

bail is granted it is draconian and at the stage of bail facts of the case should not

be considered. She further submitted that in the case of Ramu Thamodarum Pillai

Page 4 of 5

even seven years imprisonment has not been considered to be excessive to

consider bail.

Upon considering the submissions of both parties the law pertaining to the instant

matter is that if a suspect is produced before the Magistrate under the provisions

of the instant act bail is considered only upon exceptional circumstances by the

Court of Appeal. But the statute has not defined the term exceptional but in many

of the case so far decided it has been held that exceptional circumstances depends

on the facts of each case.

The Counsel for the respondents cited the case of Ramu Thamodarum Pilaai but

we observe that in the case of Ramu Thamodarum Pillai bail has been considered

only after conviction and pending the appeal, then what Court has to consider is

whether the appellant would evade Court and not face the sentence if it is affirmed

and in such a situation the likelihood of him absconding when bail is granted is

higher than in a situation where bail is considered pending the investigations and

the indictment and in that light only the length of the sentence has been

considered by their Lordships in the case of Ramu Thamodarum Pillai.. Therefore,

if as the learned State Counsel stated a suspect is to stay in remand for around

seven years pending the indictment and the investigations we consider it to be

draconian. Therefore, we are in fact surprised that an officer of the State made

such submission. If that is so the enshrinement of the fundamental rights of the

people in the Constitution will serve no purpose.

The exceptionality urged by the Counsel for the suspect is that she is being

implicated falsely and to avenge the grievance of the complainant.

The purpose of the instant act is to safeguard the rights of the victims and

witnesses, but if that is so it is the opinion of this Court that the act should not be

used for the purpose of avenging the grievances of any party.

But upon considering the submissions of both parties we observe that the instant

act had been quoted by the police before the Magistrate at the time when some

suspects had been enlarged on bail and thereafter all suspects had been

remanded, and further more although the State Counsel misquoted the law

pertaining to the case of Ramu Thamodarum Pillai and very vehemently objected

to the application failed to inform Court that the instant matter is being given

priority and is being investigated in keeping with the objectives of the act . In fact

when it has been brought to the notice of the Attorney General that the police

have abused the provisions of the instant act it is the duty of the Attorney General

to look in to the matter as the chief law officer of the State.

Therefore, for the reasons stated above this Court is of the opinion that the instant

application should be allowed and the suspect in the instant matter should be

enlarged on bail.

As such we direct the Magistrate to enlarge the above mentioned suspect on

suitable conditions of bail upon the receipt of this Order.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

I agree.
