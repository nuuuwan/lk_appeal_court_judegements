Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

The 1st accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Negombo along with three others for causing injuries to

one Anton Manoj Suranga by shooting at him using a firearm on 12th July 2005,

and thereby committing the offence of attempted murder, punishable in terms

of section 300 read with section 32 of the Penal Code.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge of Negombo, by the judgement dated

19-05-2017, found the appellant guilty as charged. However, the 2nd, 3rd and the

4th accused indicted were acquitted of the charge due to lack of evidence against

them.

Page 3 of 12

Upon the conviction, the appellant was sentenced to four years rigorous

imprisonment and in addition, he was ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000/-. In

default, he was sentenced to 6 months simple imprisonment.

He was also ordered to pay a sum of Rs. 50,000/- as compensation to PW-01,

and in default was sentenced to 10 months simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant preferred

this appeal.

The facts relating to this incident, in brief, are as follows.

According to the evidence of PW-01, on 12-06-2005 around 7.00-7.30 in the

night, he was returning home in his foot bicycle after attending Church. While

nearing the house of the appellant, he has seen the appellant standing with

folded hands. It has been his evidence that, at that time, there were street lights

and although initially he did not see the appellant, when he saw him, he never

expected that the appellant would shoot at him until he fired shots. It was his

evidence that two shots were fired, one of which struck his leg.

After that, the PW-01 has ran towards the Church and then to the beach in order

to escape. The appellant, although chased him could not find him at the beach

and later he has managed to reach his home which was about 500 meters away.

He had been categorical that although, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th accused were present

about 50 meters away from the place where he was shot at, and though they had

weapons in their hands, they never took part in the incident. It was his evidence

that his injuries were to his leg above the knee and he saw that the appellant

had a gun in his hand.

Under cross-examination, PW-01 has maintained that there were street lights at

the place of the incident and he was able to identify the appellant clearly. It had

been the suggestion on behalf of the accused that the witness did not see who

fired at him because it was dark at the time of the incident and he is accusing

the appellant and the other accused because of the previous enmity that existed

Page 4 of 12

between them. Although the witness has admitted that they had a previous

enmity, he has maintained the position that it was the appellant who fired at

him. Under cross-examination, it becomes clear that the witness was not certain

as to what type of a gun the assailant was carrying.

The doctor who examined the PW-01 three days after the incident at the

Negombo General Hospital has given evidence and had marked his Medico-Legal

Report (MLR) as P-01. When narrating the incident to the doctor, PW-01 has

informed him the incident which was consistent with what the PW-01 had said

in the Court. The doctor has observed two injuries on his right thigh, which he

has observed as an entry wound and exit wound. However, he has stated that

by the time he examined the patient, the wounds had already been treated,

therefore, he was unable to determine whether the wounds were gunshot

wounds. However, he has stated that the two wounds were parallel to each other,

and has expressed the opinion that if not treated promptly, they could be fatal

due to the loss of blood.

The police officer who has conducted the investigations has also given evidence

in this action. He had been the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the Negombo police

station when this incident was reported to him around 21.00 hours on 12-07-

2005. Upon the receipt of the first information, he had visited the scene of the

crime around 21.45 hours and had recorded his observations. It was his evidence

that he could not find evidence of a gun being fired at that time, and he could

not find any blood stains as well. It had been his evidence that he inspected the

area using the torch he was carrying and since the injured had been taken to

the hospital, he took steps to record his statement and came to know about four

suspects involved in the incident. Although he looked for them, he could not find

them in their houses, but later came to know that they have surrendered to the

Magistrate Court somewhere in August.

Under cross-examination, when asked as to what type of light was available and

how he made his observations at the scene of crime, he has stated that there

Page 5 of 12

were sufficient street lights and he used the available light as well as the torch

he was carrying for the purposes of his investigation. The defence has brought

to the notice of the Court that the witness had failed to mention that there were

street lights available at the crime scene when he filed his affidavit evidence at

the non-summary inquiry in this regard before the Magistrate Court.

At the conclusion of the prosecution evidence, the learned High Court Judge had

decided to call for a defence from the accused. The appellant had made a dock

statement and had stated that he was unaware of this incident and during the

time relevant to this incident he was at home. It had been his position that the

complainant had an animosity with him because he killed one of his relatives on

13-06-2004, and because of that animosity, he falsely implicated him to this

incident.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant

formulated the following grounds of appeals for the consideration of the Court.

1. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider whether the

identity of the appellant has been properly established by the

prosecution.

2. The defence put forward by the appellant has been wrongly evaluated

and rejected.

3. The learned High Court Judge has failed to come to a finding whether

the charge has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

4. The learned High Court Judge has taken into consideration extraneous

and irrelevant material which was not in evidence.

5. The learned High Court Judge has failed to fulfill the requirements of

section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

6. In any event, the sentence was excessive given the facts and the

circumstances of the case.

Page 6 of 12

It was the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel that although it was

the evidence of PW-01 that two shots were fired at him, the medical report

marked P-01 speaks about only one injury. It was his position that the police

investigator did not find any evidence of an altercation or the foot bicycle the PW-

01 was allegedly riding at the time, and even no empty shells were found at the

scene of crime, which points to the possibility that this incident was not

something that happened as stated by the PW-01.

It was his contention that PW-01 has not given clear evidence as to how he

identified the appellant and had only stated that there was street light and he

did not see the appellant initially. The learned Presidents Counsel points out

that the evidence of the investigating officer was not satisfactory as to the light

condition for him to observe things at the scene of the crime, where he has given

contradictory evidence before the High Court and at the non-summary inquiry.

It was his stand that since the OIC of the Negombo police station has reached

the scene of the crime few hours after the incident, if there was an incident as

alleged, he could have observed relevant evidence in this regard whereas he has

not, which should have been considered in favour of the appellant.

Commenting on the judgement of the learned High Court Judge, it was the stand

of the learned Presidents Counsel that it was a total misdirection for the learned

trial Judge to conclude that the PW-01 was able to identify the accused from the

light available in the nearby houses which was not a matter in evidence. He also

contends that the contradiction marked V-01 had been considered by the

learned High Court Judge on a completely wrong basis. Another contention of

the learned Presidents Counsel was that the learned High Court Judge has failed

to consider the dock statement of the appellant, in its correct perspective, which

in his view was a misdirection by the learned High Court Judge. He also points

out that the learned High Court Judges determination that the PW-01s evidence

had been corroborated by the evidence of the doctor was also a misdirection in

law. It was his contention that the learned High Court Judge has failed to

examine the nexus between the appellant and the injured and has failed to

Page 7 of 12

determine whether the prosecution has proved the case against the appellant

beyond reasonable doubt.

It was his position that the learned High Court Judge has failed to follow the

essential requirements of a judgement as envisaged in section 283 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act and thereby failed to afford a fair trial to the appellant,

and it was dangerous to allow such a judgement to stand.

The position of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) in this regard was

that it was unfair to argue that there was no proper evaluation of the evidence.

It was his position that the learned High Court Judge has considered the

evidence of PW-01 who was the injured and that of the doctor who examined him

and the investigating officer in its correct perspective. It was his position that

even the position of the appellant had been that there was a previous enmity

between the parties, and PW-01 has given cogent and trustworthy evidence as

to the incident and that he has clearly identified the appellant as the person who

shot at him. It was his position that if one takes care to read the judgment as a

whole, it becomes clear that the learned High Court Judge has come to a correct

finding as to the guilt of the appellant, which needs no disturbance from this

Court.

He was also of the view that given the facts and the circumstances, the sentence

imposed by the learned High Court Judge was very much fair and adequate.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

I will now consider all the grounds of appeal urged by the learned Presidents

Counsel together, as they are interconnected.

Establishing the identity of an accused as the person who committed the crime

is an essential requirement in a criminal action.

Page 8 of 12

In the judgement of Rex Vs. Turnbull and Another (1977) QB 224, it was

observed that;

Where the case against an accused depends wholly on the correctness of

the identity of the accused, the judge should warn the jury of the special

need to for caution before relying on the correctness of the identification by

the witness.

The Judge should tell the jury that;

Caution is required to avoid the risk of injustice.

A witness who is honest may be wrong, even if they are convinced,

they are right.

A witness who is convincing may still be wrong.

More than one witness may be wrong.

A witness who recognizes the defendant, even when the witness

knows the defendant well, may be wrong.

Some of the circumstances a judge should direct the jury to examine in

order to find out whether a correct identification has been made include;

The length of time the accused was observed by the witness;

The distance the witness was from the accused;

The state of the light;

The length of time elapsed between the original observation and the

subsequent identification to the police.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his book The Law of Evidence Volume 1 at page

663 discusses the question of identity in the following manner.

A fundamental requisite in a criminal case is to establish the identity of the

accused as the guilty party. The text-books abound with instances of what

were supposed to be clear identifications which proved to be fallacious and

defective. These include the case where an honest witness was deceived by

the broad glare of sunlight, (R Vs. Wood and Brown [Ann-Reg. 1784])

Page 9 of 12

Much of the value of direct evidence of identification will depend on the

personal appearance of the subject of identification. Many persons cannot

be easily distinguished from others. The liability mistake is greater where

the questionable identity is a matter of deduction and inference and the

expression of an opinion than where it is the subject of direct evidence.

(Wills, op. cit., 7th edition., pp 197-200)

It is my view that the question of identification has to be determined by a trial

judge depending on the facts and the circumstances of each case.

When it comes to the facts of the case under consideration, the PW-01 who was

the injured and the only witness who speaks as to what happened, has given

clear evidence that he identified the appellant because there was sufficient street

light at that time.

There cannot be any dispute that the injured and the appellant as well as other

accused indicted were well known to each other. It has been the evidence of the

PW-01 that the other accused are the brothers of the appellant. It was the

evidence of the PW-01 that while paddling the foot bicycle towards his house he

did not see the appellant initially, which is understandable. He has stated in his

evidence that he saw the appellant at a close range, but never believed that he

will shoot at him. As soon as he was shot at, he has run towards the church and

the beach leaving his foot bicycle. Even under cross examination, he has been

consistent in his evidence that he was able to identify the appellant because of

the street light available. He has given clear evidence that the other accused was

standing about fifty meters away and they were not involved in the shooting.

I do not find any reason to doubt the evidence of the PW-01 that it was the

appellant who shot at him, as his evidence has been cogent and trustworthy in

that regard, although he was the only witness who speaks about the incident.

I find no basis for the argument that the learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider whether the identity of the appellant has been properly established. I

Page 10 of 12

find that aspect has been well considered by the learned High Court Judge at

page 04 of the judgment. (Page 163 of the brief).

However, as pointed out correctly by the learned Presidents Counsel, I find a

misdirection as to the evidence considered in that regard, when it was

determined that apart from the street light available, there were lights available

in the houses nearby. I find that the mind of the learned High Court Judge has

been influenced because of the way the learned State Counsel who prosecuted

the matter has questioned the witness.

Although the learned State Counsel has posed a question as such, his answer

has been that he saw the appellant because of the street light available.

For matters of clarity, I will now reproduce the relevant question and the answer

which appears at page 57 of the brief.

: ?

?

: .

It is clear from the judgment that the above consideration by the learned High

Court Judge had been in addition to the proven source of light available at the

time of the incident, which has not caused any prejudice to the appellant as the

identity is a matter that has been established beyond reasonable doubt as

considered earlier.

Although the learned High Court Judge has considered medical evidence as

corroboration of the evidence of the injured, in fact, it needs to be considered as

evidence consistent with that of the injured, and not corroboration in its strict

sense.

The proviso of Article 138 of the Constitution which confers appellate jurisdiction

to the Court of Appeal reads as follows;

Page 11 of 12

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

The PW-03, the main investigation officer, has stated in his evidence that he

inspected the scene of the crime in the night itself using the torch he was

carrying and the available street light. In his affidavit evidence tendered to the

Magistrate Court for the purposes of the non-summary inquiry, he has failed to

mention that there was a street light, as pointed by the learned Presidents

Counsel in his submissions to this Court. I find that when the witness was

confronted at the trial in this regard, he has admitted that it was an omission,

but has stated that it was an oversight in the affidavit evidence, but in fact he

has made notes in that regard.

I am unable to agree that it was a material omission on the part of the

investigating officer that has the effect of vitiating the evidence of PW-01 that

there was a street light at the scene of the crime. Similarly, the failure of the

police who came to the scene of the crime few hours after the incident to find

any spent bullets and the foot bicycle of the injured, is not a matter that can be

held against the evidence of the PW-01, or a reason to believe such an incident

did not take place.

I do not find merit in the contention that the learned High Court Judge has failed

to follow the essential requirements of a judgment as provided for by section 283

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

In the judgment, the learned High Court Judge has considered the evidence with

a clear understanding that looking for proof whether the PW-01 has identified

the person who shot at him was paramount in this action. After deciding on the

identity of the appellant, the learned trial judge has considered the evidence as

a whole to come to the finding that the appellant was guilty as charged, while

acquitting the other accused for reasons recorded.

Page 12 of 12

As I have stated before, the mentioned infirmities in the judgment have not

caused prejudice to the appellant or has occasioned a failure of justice, as even

if considered in its correct perspective, the only conclusion that can be reached

was that of the guilt of the appellant and nothing else.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no merit in the first five grounds of

appeal urged by the learned Presidents Counsel on behalf of the appellant.

The last ground of appeal urged is that the sentence was excessive, given the

facts and the circumstances of the case.

In this matter, the appellant has been sentenced to four years rigorous

imprisonment, for a fine, and in addition a compensation of Rs. 50000/- has

been ordered. This was after a full trial. Given the fact that a firearm has been

used to commit the crime, I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge

had been very lenient towards the appellant in her sentencing order, which need

no disturbance from this Court.

The appeal is dismissed, as it is devoid of merit. The conviction and the sentence

affirmed.
