Judgment

This appeal emanates from the Order made by the learned High Court Judge on 09.11.2012

exercising revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa Province

Holden in Kegalle where the learned High Court Judge set aside the Order dated 19.02.2010

made by the learned Magistrate of Warakapola.

The Officer in Charge of Police Station-Warakapola had filed an information on 09.09.2009

in terms of Section 66(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 naming Rev.

Mampita Hemaloka Thero as 1st Party and Dissanayake Rallalage Nihal Chandrasiri as 2nd

Party stating there was a dispute between the parties over a roadway.

It appears that Rev. Baddegama Sudassi Thero and Dissanayaka Rallalge Padmasiri had

intervened as 1st Party-Intervenient Party and 2nd PartyIntervenient Party respectively. It

was the contention of the 2nd Party-Respondent that the impugned roadway has been

obstructed by the 1st PartyRespondent claiming that the said roadway is to be a private

temple road.

It appears that the learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge has

followed the procedure under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act by displaying

the notices, and thereupon, 92 persons had intervened claiming that the said roadway was

used by them to go through Burunnawa Road to Oththapitiya Road. The temple premises is

on either side of the said road, and obstructions had been placed along Burunnawa Road in

3 places as seen in the sketch.

Subsequently, parties filed affidavits, counter affidavits with documents and the learned

Primary Court Judge after perusing the material placed before him and subsequent to a

site inspection, made a determination on 19.02.2010 that the impugned roadway has been

obstructed by the 1st PartyRespondent.

Being aggrieved by the said determination, 1st PartyPetitioner-Respondent invoked the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa (Kegalle) seeking to

revise the said determination made by the Primary Court Judge.

Page 4 of 12

Thereafter, the learned High Court Judge having allowed the application of the 1st Party

Petitioner-Respondent had made an Order dated 09.11.2012 setting aside the Order of the

learned Primary Court Judge, holding that there is no servitudanal right for the 2nd Party-

Respondent-Appellant to use the said roadway as of right as this was abandoned in January

2008. Thus, 2nd Party-Respondent-Appellant could not use his right to use the said roadway

which existed only up to January 2008 and hence sought to exercise his right to use the

roadway in 14.03.2009 after about one and a half years.

It is of the view of the learned High Court Judge that there was no consistent use by 2nd

Party-Respondent of his servitudanal right, as for anyone claiming such right must use it

continuously for over ten years. The learned High Court Judge is of the view that the right

of the 2nd Party-Respondent-Appellant had been waived off in January 2008.

It is observable that the learned Primary Court Judge after a careful analysis of the

evidence had rejected the contention of the 1st Party-Petitioner that the matter in issue

comes under Section 68 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act and the learned Magistrate

has proceeded to make his Order under Section 69(2) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

In this connection, Court draws the attention to the case Ramalingam Vs. Thangarajah

reported in [1982] 2 SLR 693;

That person is entitled to possession until he is evicted by due process of law. A

Judge should therefore in an inquiry under Part VII of the aforesaid Act, confine

himself to the question of actual possession on the date of filing of the information

except in a case where a person who had been in possession of the land had been

dispossessed within a period of two months immediately before the date of the

information. He is not to decide any question of title or right to possession of the

parties to the land. Evidence bearing on title can be considered only when the

evidence as to possession is clearly balanced and the presumption of possession

which flows from title may tilt the balance in favour of the owner and help in

deciding the question of possession.

On the other hand, if the dispute is in regard to any right to any land other than

right of possession of such land, the question for decision, according to section

Page 5 of 12

69(1), is who is entitled to the right which is subject of dispute. The word entitle"

here connotes the ownership of the right. The Court has to determine which of the

parties has acquired that right, or is entitled for the time being to exercise that

right. In contradistinction to section 68, section 69 requires the Court to determine

the question which party is entitled to the disputed right preliminary to making an

order under section 69(2).

The law recognizes that right of way could be acquired in the following ways.

By grant By prescription By way of necessity

It was submitted on behalf of the 1st Party-Petitioner-Respondent that right of way by

prescription and right of way by necessity can be decided only by a Court of competent

jurisdiction and to declare a right of way by prescription, Court has to enter a decree and

for that purpose Court has to satisfy that legal requisites required by Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance are fulfilled by evidence led.

It was further submitted on behalf of the 1st Party-Petitioner-Respondent that the Primary

Court is not a Court of competent jurisdiction to decide matters related to rights acquired

by prescription or necessity. It is the District Court that has jurisdiction to decide and

determine property rights of the parties after admitting both oral and documentary

evidence.

In 66 proceedings, if a decree and/or the Judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction

declaring the entitlement of a right of way by prescription on necessity was produced, then

the Magistrate could act under Section 69(2) but not otherwise.

Attention of Court was drawn to Paragraph 2 of page 262 of the brief, where the

Magistrates Court has determined that the 2nd Party hasn't acquired a right of way either by

way of a deed or by way of a Court order. The 2nd Party has not produced any deed in proof

of acquisition of servitude.

The attention of Court was drawn to Paragraph 9 of the 2nd Party-Respondents affidavit in

which the 2nd Party admits that the land is dedicated to a temple. It was submitted that

Page 6 of 12

when the 2nd Party admits the subject matter belongs to a temple, 2nd Party cannot claim

prescriptive rights against the temple property in view of Section 34 of the Buddhist

Temporalities Ordinance No. 19 of 1931. (i.e the title of temple property will not be

affected by a claim of prescription by a 3rd Party). On behalf of the 1st Party-Petitioner-

Respondent, it was submitted that 2nd Party-Respondent-Appellant cannot succeed in their

claim for a right of way by prescription inasmuch as title of the temple can no way be

prejudiced to a 3rd Party claim of prescription. Therefore, Court ought to have rejected

any claim of 2nd Party-Respondent-Respondent-Appellant based on prescription.

Furthermore, on behalf of the 1st Party-Petitioner-Respondent, the position was taken up

that after a field inspection learned Magistrate has observed an existence of an alternative

road, which is a well-built tar road. The learned Magistrate has further observed that the

said alternative road, is not a less convenient road.

Moreover, it was argued on behalf of the 1st Party-Petitioner-Respondent that if a person

claiming a right of way has an alternative road to the one claimed, although such road is

less convenient and involves a longer and more arduous journey, so long as the existing

road gives reasonable access to a public road, he must be content and cannot insist upon

a more direct approach over neighbours property.

As such, it was the contention of the 1st Party-Petitioner-Respondent that even if the

Magistrate has jurisdiction to decide on a right of way of necessity (which the 1st Party-

Petitioner-1st Respondent does not concede), the 2nd Party cannot succeed in a claim for a

servitude by necessity inasmuch as the learned Magistrate has conceded existence of an

alternative road. Therefore, it was submitted that on the available material, Court could

not have possibly granted a right of way on the basis of necessity or prescription.

It is worthy to note that the aforesaid contention of 1st Party-Petitioner-Respondent applies

when deciding a right of way by way of necessity or on prescription in civil cases. In a

dispute relating to a roadway emanating from an application under Section 66 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act, court is not involved in an investigation into the title or the

right to possession, which is the function of a civil Court. What the Primary Court is required

to do is to take a preventive action and make a provisional order pending final adjudication

of rights of the parties in a civil Court. Court has to make a provisional order to prevent

Page 7 of 12

the breach of the peace among parties until the competent civil jurisdiction solves the

matter in dispute.

It is worthy to note that the complaint made by the 2nd Party-Respondent falls within

Section 69(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act which reads as follows;

Where the dispute relates to any right to any land or any part of a land other than

the right to possession of such land of part thereof, the Judge of the Primary Court

shall determine as to who is entitled to the right which is the subject of the dispute

and make an order under subsection 2.

Section 75 of the Act defines a dispute affecting land as follows;

In this Part dispute affecting land includes any dispute as to the right to the

possession of any land or part of a land and the buildings thereon or the boundaries

there- of or as to the right to cultivate any land or part of a land, or as to the right

to the crops or produce of any land, or part of a land, or as to any right in the nature

of a servitude affecting the land and any reference to land in this Part includes a

reference to any building standing thereon.

Thus, in this case, what is required to be established by the 2nd Party-Respondent is not

that he has a servitude but only that he is entitled to a right which is in the nature of a

servitude.

Section 69(2) sets out power of the Primary Court Judge when inquiring into a complaint

under Section 69(1).

An order under this subsection may declare that any person specified therein shall

be entitled to any such right in or respecting the land or in any part of the land as

may be specified in the order until such person is deprived of such right by virtue of

an order or decree of a competent court, and prohibit all disturbance or interference

with the exercise of such right by such party other than under the authority of an

order or decree as aforesaid.

Page 8 of 12

In the case of Tudor Vs. Anulawathie and others [1999] 3 Sri LR 235 the scope of an

Order that could be made in terms of Section 69 of the Act was discussed in the following

manner;

The above subsections, 69 (1) and (2), require the Primary Court after inquiry to-

(i) Determine as to who is entitled to the right.

(ii) Make an order that the person specified therein shall be entitled to such right

until such person is deprived of that right by virtue of an order or decree of a

competent Court.

(iii) Prohibit all interference with or disturbance of that right other than under the

authority of an order or decree of a competent Court.

It has been held in the case of Ananda Sarath Paranagama Vs. Dhammadinna Sarath

Paranagama and Kamitha Aswin Paranagama CA (PHC) 117/2013 [C.A.M. 12.12.2013]

A party does not need to establish a servitudanal right by cogent evidence as is

usually considered in a civil Court. The required proof of the users right in terms of

Section 69(1) of the Act, is to consider a right in the nature of a servitude or long

term use.

Thus, it is apparent that proving the enjoyment of the right at the time the dispute arose

is sufficient.

In this instance, Court draws the attention to Nandawathie and another Vs. Mahindasena

[2009] 2 Sri LR 237 where Justice Ranjith Silva held that;

In an application for revision before the High Court, there is no question

of rehearing examination of the evidence in order to arrive at a courts decision.

The task of the High Court is to decide not whether the decision is right or wrong

but simply whether the decision is legal or illegal an order. When an Order of the

Primary Court is challenged by way of revision in the High Court, Judge can examine

only the legality of the Order and not the correctness of that order.

It is the duty of Court to ascertain whether the High Court acted lawfully/legally. It is not

the correctness of the Order, but the legality of that Order that is in question. The High

Page 9 of 12

Court is of the view that the right has to be exercised continuously, the reason being that

there was a time lag or an interruption from January 2008 to March 2009 where the

Appellant and the other Intervenients had not used the roadway voluntarily with consent.

Moreover, it was stated that the Appellants and the Intervenients had waived that right to

use the road in 2008 and can no longer claim a servitudanal right.

It is pertinent to note the fact that the impugned road is maintained by the Pradeshiya

Sabawa. Apparently, this aspect has not been considered by the learned High Court Judge.

Though the existence of a right of way in 2008 is admitted, the issue revolves around the

period from January 2008 to March 2009 during which the roadway was not used.

It was submitted on behalf of the 2nd Party-Respondent-Appellant that the non-user (as

emphasized by the High Court) is not set out as a mode of extinction of ownership of any

corporeal thing. Under our law, title to immovable property cannot be lost by non-user

(non-possession). A person does not lose the right to ownership of immovable property by

non-user. This is not a question of not using the road for over 10 years where Section 3 of

the Prescription Ordinance may apply.

Due to the Prime Ministers imminent visit to the temple, the roadway was temporarily put

on hold. It is worthy to note that the learned High Court Judge did not say the right was

abandoned but was only referring to non-user.

As per the rule, once a street always a street which was cited in the case of Municipal

Council of Colombo vs. Hewavitharana [13 NLR 241] and upon the fact that this road is

a public road maintained by the Pradeshiya Sabhawa, there is no issue of losing the right.

Record shows that the Pradeshiya Sabhawa had taken many steps to repair this road and

money was utilized for such purpose.

In view of the letter by Pradeshiya Sabhawa dated 14.07.2009 [11], the 1st Party-Petitioner

-Respondent was requested by the Chairman of Pradeshiya Sabhawa-Warakapola to remove

the obstruction and allow the villagers to use the disputed roadway since the road way

belongs to the said Pradeshiya Sabhawa and had been used over a long period of time by

the villagers. Moreover, the letter by the Pradeshiya Sabhawa dated 25.09.2009 [12], to

Page 10 of 12

the 1st Party-Petitioner-Respondent had stated not to obstruct the said road and to have

the illegal construction removed, failing which, legal action would follow.

It appears that the Pradeshiya Sabhawa had informed the Registrar of Court by letter dated

26.11.2009 [13] of the unlawful steps taken by the 1st Party-Petitioner-Respondent.

Furthermore, Grama Niladaris letter dated 28.10.2009 [15] informed the Divisional

Secretary of the unlawful and illegal steps taken by the 1st Party-Petitioner-Respondent in

obstructing the roadway and the letter dated 18.11.2009 [X5] from the Grama Sevaka

emphatically points out that this road has been in existence for over 20 years and money

has been allocated to repair the road.

The letters X5A and X6 and the fact that money has also been released for the maintenance

or repair [X7A] show that this roadway is maintained by the Pradeshiya Sabhawa for the

public as it is a public road. It was argued that this is the reason for the Primary Court to

state that non-use of a public road would not entitle another to claim a right over the road.

In this instance, it was submitted that the Order of the Primary Court is a provisional Order,

and if any dispute exists over civil rights, one must resort to a civil action. The Primary

Court was of the view that as there is a breach of peace and as the road has been classified

as a public road and as a road maintained by the Pradeshiya Sabhawa, the Respondents are

entitled to use the roadway and to have the right granted until the matter is finally decided

by a civil Court with competent jurisdiction.

It appears that a large number of villagers were using this roadway. Moreover, the question

of abandonment would not arise as the matter was pending before the Mediation Board.

For abandonment to arise, it should be a complete waiver with the intent to give the right

of way but the fact that it was before the Mediation Board shows that there was no

abandonment of the right. Thus, the 2nd Party-Respondent-Appellant as well as the other

Intervenients are entitled to use the roadway.

The difference between abandonment and non user was argued on behalf of the

Appellant. It was submitted that abandonment bears the ingredient of intention and

where non-user is concerned, it does not bear the intention. The learned High Court

Page 11 of 12

Judge has not considered that this is a road maintained by the Pradeshiya Sabhawa for the

public.

In view of the aforementioned reasons, it is relevant to note that the High Court has erred

in law by not appreciating the legal position regarding extinction of servitudes. The

evidence has shown that the road concerned was a public road maintained by the

Pradeshiya Sabhawa for the villagers which villagers had used and vehicles went over this

path over a long period of time except for a limited period. Moreover, the wall put up by

the temple was shown as illegal as per the correspondence from the Pradeshiya Sabhawa

by letters marked as 11, 12, 13 and 15.

It is seen that the learned Magistrate had correctly applied the relevant law to the facts of

the case and had come to a correct finding based on the evidence placed before Court.

Moreover, it is evident that the road has been used for over 10 years and was maintained

by the Pradeshiya Sabhawa. The High Court has accepted that the impugned road was used

by the villagers. However, the High Court has erroneously held that Appellant has lost the

servitudanal rights on the basis that there was a waiver of the right by not having used it

for over 1 year.

Moreover, the learned High Court Judge has failed to appreciate that this is a public

roadway maintained by the Pradeshiya Sabhawa for the villagers. The documentary

evidence submitted by the Appellant and the Intervenient parties have substantiated that

the impugned road is maintained by the Pradeshiya Sabhawa and it is not the private

property of the temple. The 1st Respondent had not substantiated that the disputed road

was owned by the temple or that the temple was given exclusive right to use the impugned

road.

In such circumstances, the Court has to consider whether the parties are entitled to use

the disputed roadway as emphasized by Justice Salam in the case of Ananda Sarath

Paranagama Vs. Dhammadinna Sarath Paranagama and Kamitha Aswin Paranagama

[supra]

Page 12 of 12

It is evident that the disputed road used by the Appellant and the villagers does not belong

to the temple or to the parties, but is a road maintained for the villagers by the Pradeshiya

Sabhawa. Thus, the learned High Court Judge has erred in applying a wrong law with regard

to servitudanal rights of the Appellant.

In view of the foregoing reasons, it amply proves that the Appellant and the other road

users had the required proof of the users right in terms of Section 69(1) of the Act when

considering the right in the nature of a servitudanal rights or long terms use.

Therefore, I hold that the Appellant and the other road users are allowed to use a 10 feet

roadway.

We allow the Appeal of the Appellant and set aside the Order of the learned High Court

Judge dated 09.11.2012 and affirm the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 19.02.2010.

No Order is made regarding the cost of this appeal.
