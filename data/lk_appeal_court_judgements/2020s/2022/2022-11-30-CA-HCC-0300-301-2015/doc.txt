JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) were indicted in the High Court of Colombo as follows:

1. On or about 16th October 1990 committing the murder of Noel Antony

Alfred Barry an offence punishable under Section 296 read with

Section 32 of the Penal Code.

2. In the course of the same transaction committing the robbery of a gold

chain from Turin Nishara Amaan an offence punishable under Section

380 of the Penal Code.

3. In the course of the same transaction voluntarily causing hurt to

Turin Nishara Amaan an offence punishable under Section 315 of the

Penal Code.

4. In the course of the same transaction voluntarily causing hurt to

Turin Nishara Amaan an offence punishable under Section 315 of the

Penal Code.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Colombo as the

Appellants had opted for a non-jury trial. After the conclusion of the

prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge had called for the defence

3 | P a g e

and the Appellants had made dock statements and closed their case. After

considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High Court

Judge had convicted the Appellants for 1st, 2nd and 3rd counts and acquitted

them from 4th count.

The Appellants were sentenced as follows on 26/11/2015:

For the 1st Count both were sentenced to death.

For the 2nd Count each sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment.

For the 3rd Count each sentenced to 02 years rigorous imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants have given consent to argue this matter in their absence due to

the Covid 19 pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellants were

connected via Zoom platform from prison.

Background of the Case.

According to PW3, the deceased is her second son whose family also lived in

the same house where the witness lived. On the day of the incident, when

she was attending to some work inside the house, at about 10 a.m. PW1

Haleema, the wife of the deceased came crying into the house and informed

her husband was stabbed. When she rushed to the scene, she had seen the

deceased fallen on the ground and the Appellants were standing beside the

deceased. When she tried to reach the deceased the 1st Appellant had kicked

her and the 2nd Appellant brandishing a knife prevented her going close to

the deceased. Although the deceased was taken to hospital in a three-

wheeler, he was pronounced dead on admission.

4 | P a g e

PW10 Dr.Dayapala was called by the prosecution to give evidence on the

Post Morten Report prepared by AJMO Dimuth Gunawardene. In his

evidence he had stated that there were 09 injuries on the deceased and most

of it being cut or stab injuries. According to him the injuries sustained by

the deceased are necessarily fatal in nature. According to the AJMO who held

the post mortem, the death had resulted due to multiple penetrating stabbed

injuries to the chest.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant had raised three grounds of

appeal which are set out below:

1. Are the available items of evidence not sufficient enough to

prove the case against the Appellants beyond reasonable doubt.

2. Has the Learned Trial Court Judge misdirected himself and had

used some portions of PW1s evidence when writing the

judgement which was adopted under Section 33 of Evidence

Ordinance and later rejected by the trial judge.

3. Has the Learned Trial Judge evaluated the two dock statements

given by the Appellants.

In the 1st ground of appeal, the Appellants contend that the available items

of evidence are not sufficient to prove the case against the Appellants beyond

reasonable doubt.

In this case nobody had seen how the deceased sustained the injuries.

According to PW3, her daughter-in-law who had married the deceased had

told her that the deceased had been stabbed but not divulged the identity of

the assailants. When PW3 had rushed to the place of incident she had seen

the Appellants standing there and the second Appellant had possessed a

knife and the 1st Appellant had prevented her reaching the deceased. She

further said that when she went out nobody except the Appellants were

present at the scene. As PW1 had gone abroad during the pendency of the

5 | P a g e

trial before the High Court, her evidence given in the non-summary inquiry

was adopted. Although it was adopted, it was rejected by the Trial Judge as

it had not been led properly during the trial. Hence, PW1s evidence has no

material value at all.

PW2, the second daughter of PW3 also came out upon hearing that the

deceased had been stabbed. But she had not divulged anything the Appellant

had done when her mother went to the spot. She only confirmed that that

the 2nd Appellant had possessed a knife and the 1st Appellant had snatched

her gold chain. She also said when she came out people had already gathered

there.

In the cross examination she admitted that the deceased had number of

cases and was one time taken to the Criminal Investigation Department.

Although PW3 and PW2 rushed to the scene after hearing that the deceased

had been stabbed, both had contradicted their evidence on material points.

According to PW3 when she went to the spot the Appellants were present

and 1st Appellant had assaulted her while 2nd Appellant had threated and

prevented her reaching the deceased. But according to PW2 when she came

out people had already gathered there nothing done by the Appellants as

described by PW3. She only added that her gold chain had been snatched by

the 1st Appellant. PW3 nowhere in her evidence mentioned about snatching

a gold chain from PW2.As the two witnesses simultaneously came out from

the house after hearing about the incident, but they deviated themselves on

material points which certainly endorses the 1st ground of appeal of the

Appellants.

6 | P a g e

In the second ground of appeal, the Counsel for the Appellants contended

that the Learned Trial Court Judge misdirected himself and had used some

portions of PW1s evidence when writing the judgement which was adopted

under Section 33 of Evidence Ordinance and later rejected by the trial judge.

As stated earlier even though an order was made by the Trial Judge to adopt

the evidence given by PW1 at the non-summary inquiry under Section 33 of

evidence Ordinance, it had not been adopted properly into the proceedings.

Hence PW1s evidence had not gone into the proceedings. Hence the Court

cannot rely on such evidence.

But in the judgment as pointed out by the Appellants, the Learned High

Court Judge had relied on the evidence of PW1. This has caused a serious

prejudiced to the Appellants right to fair trial. The relevant portion is re-

produced below:

Pages 300-301 of the brief.)

In this case no one had seen the stabbing to the deceased. But the Learned

High Court Judge in his judgment had come to the conclusion that the 2nd

Appellant had assaulted the deceased with the knife he had possessed at

that time. This is totally incorrect and thereby caused prejudiced to the

Appellants right to a fair trial. The relevant portion of the judgment is re-

produced bellow:

(Page 303 of the brief.)

7 | P a g e

Due to aforesaid reasons this ground also has merit.

In the final ground of appeal, the Counsel for the Appellants contends that

the Learned Trial Judge has not properly evaluated the two dock statements

given by the Appellants.

In Queen v. Buddharakkita Thero 63 NLR 433 the court held that:

That the right of an accused person to make an unsworn

statement from the dock is recognized in our law. That right would

be of no value unless such statement is treated as evidence on

behalf of the accused, subject however to the infirmity which

attaches to statements that are unsworn and have not been

tested by cross-examination.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgement at pages 294-295 and 300

had considered the dock statements of the Appellants. But he had not

discussed the legal basis as to acceptance or rejection of a dock statement.

He had only considered the dock statements but had not given reasons as to

why he rejecting the dock statements of the Appellants and accepting the

prosecution case. Hence it is incorrect to say that the Learned High Court

Judge had properly analyzed the dock statements in the judgment. Hence

this appeal ground also has merit.

In this case the learned High Court judge has failed to appreciate the weak

evidence led against the Appellants by the prosecution. Evidence given by

PW3 and PW2 had contradicted each other on material points. The evidence

given by PW1 at the non-summary inquiry had been rejected by the Trial

Judge. As the prosecution had failed to establish that the Appellants were

the perpetrator of the crime for which they had been charged in this case,

the benefit of the doubt should be accrued to the Appellants.

8 | P a g e

Therefore, I allow the appeal and acquit the Appellants from all the charges.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgement to

the High Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
