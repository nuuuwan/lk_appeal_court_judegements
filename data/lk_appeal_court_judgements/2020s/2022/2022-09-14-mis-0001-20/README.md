Decided on: 14.09.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The complainant appellant has filed the instant application to set aside

the Order dated 13.12.2018 of the Magistrate of Colombo. The said

Order of the Magistrate had confiscated the vehicle bearing number

250/7475. The claimant appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) is supposed to have purchased the above mentioned vehicle

from the accused who had been acquitted from the substantive case.

The accused from whom the appellant had purchased the vehicle had

been charged in the Magistrates Court under Section 2A (2) of the

Motor Traffic Act (altering the chassis and engine numbers in the

vehicle) and acquitted, and as such the appellant had made a claim for

the above mentioned vehicle in terms of Section 425 of the Code of

Criminal procedure Act No 15 of 1979, an inquiry had been held and

upon the conclusion of the same magistrate had forfeited the vehicle.

The submission of the appellant is that as per Section 431 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act, he is the registered owner of the vehicle and

is a bona fide purchaser, and as such he is entitled to the possession of

the vehicle. He further stated that although the government analyst

report had stated that the chassis number and the engine number has

been altered, the appellant had no knowledge of the same and the

Page 4 of 9

vehicle had been first registered in Sri Lanka in 1997 and the appellant

had purchased the vehicle in 2007. Therefore, he has no knowledge of

the said alternation and the government analyst report does not specify

as to when the alternations had been made.

The State Counsel appearing for the respondent objected to this

application and stated that the alternations of the chassis and engine

numbers is common ground to both parties and the date of alternation

is also not known but the Magistrate has very wisely said according to

the state counsel that, the ambiguity pertaining to the date of

alternations does not make this vehicle a legal automobile registered

in Sri Lanka.

The appellant had pleaded further that the documentation being prima

facie legitimate, the vehicle had been registered in terms of provisions

in the Motor Traffic Act. This submission has been substantiated by the

evidence given in the inquiry of the Assistant Commissioner,

Department of Motor traffic who say that the documentation produced

by the appellant tally with the details in the computer system but the

engine and chassis numbers had been tampered with upon examination

by the Government Analyst.

Having considered the submissions of both parties, this Court draws its

attention to Chapter 38 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code which

deals with the disposal of property being the subject matter of offences

before trial and after trial. Section 431 of the Code deals with disposal

of property being the subject matter of the offences before trial and

Section 425 of the Code deals with disposal of property being the

subject matter of offences after trial. In this instance as the appellant

Page 5 of 9

had claimed the vehicle after the conclusion of the trial, it is

appropriate to consider Section 431 of the Code at this point of time.

We draw our attention to a case decided by another division of this

bench, in the case of CA (PHC) 149/13 in which the case of Silva and

another v OIC Thabuththegama Police Station and another (1991) 2

SLR 83 has been considered and where it had been held that, Section

431 (1) Section 431(2) gives three options to a Magistrate regarding

the property that has been seized by the Police. They are;

(1) Whether the property should be kept in official custody pending

the conclusion the inquiry or the trial, (2) Whether the property should be delivered to the person entitled

to the possession pending the conclusion of the trial on conditions to be imposed, (3) Whether the property should be delivered to such persons

without conditions.

The above quoted judgment further says that there has been a

divergence of judicial opinion about the person to whom a Magistrate

should deliver the property in the event Court feels that such property

need not be kept in the official custody of the Court. The early position

was that to deliver the property to the person entitled to the

possession thereof .. Only made it possible for the Magistrate to

make an order delivering the property to the person from whom it was

seized. to the Magistrate to deliver the property to a party other than

the party from whom it was seized. The said judgment also refers to

the case of Sugathapala v Thabiraja 67 NLR 91 which had given the

discretion to the Magistrate to deliver the property to a person other

than the party from whom it was seized. The above quoted judgment

had further observed that the discretion vested is a necessary power

Page 6 of 9

to the Magistrate since the person from whose possession property

was seized may have obtained possession of the property dishonestly,

fraudulently or criminally. But it further says that a bona fide

purchaser in possession of property that had previously been dealt

with dishonestly/fraudulently has been held to be entitled to

possession of the property.

In the case of Hasvi v Jayathissa and two others 2011 1 SLR 94 it has

been held that, Magistrate was under a duty to handover the

property to the true owner and not the person from whom the

property was seized by the police unless the latter was the true

owner. But a contrary view had been held in the case of De Alwis v De

Alwis 1979 1 SLR 17 where it has been held that, the property seized

by the police should be returned to the person from whom the

property has been seized.

In the instant matter, at the inquiry the appellant has not cross

examined the witnesses put forward by the prosecution and neither has

he given evidence. But the fact that the chassis and engine numbers

have been altered is common ground to both parties. The Magistrate

had confiscated the vehicle on the basis that although the accused that

were charged for the alternation were acquitted because the date of

alternation is not proven by the prosecution, the subject matter of the

instant case has been subject to an illegal activity. But as the date of

alternation is not known and as the prosecution has failed to establish

the same, the substantive case has failed. The appellant had claimed

the vehicle because as per the documentation he had duly registered

the vehicle in terms of the Motor Traffic Act. Therefore the question

Page 7 of 9

arises as to whether the Magistrate is justified in forfeiting a vehicle if

the owner as claimed is unaware of the alleged alteration.

At this point this Court draws its attention as to what should be

considered when a vehicle is confiscated which had been the subject

matter of an offence.

In the case of Manawadu v AG (Supra) it has been held that, .. By

Section 7 of Act No.13 of 1982 (which amends Section 40) it was not

intended to deprive an owner of his vehicle used by the offender: in

committing a forest offence without his (owners) knowledge and

without his participation. The word forfeited must be given the

meaning liable to be forfeited so as to avoid the injustice that would

flow on the construction that forfeiture of the vehicle is automatic on

the conviction of the accused. The Amended subsection 40 does not

exclude by necessary implication the rule of audi alteram partem.

The owner of the lorry not a party to the case is entitled to be heard

on the question of forfeiture of the lorry, if he satisfied the court that

the accused committed the offence without his knowledge or

participation, his lorry will not be liable for forfeiture. The magistrate

must hear the owner of the lorry on the question of showing cause

why the lorry is not liable to be forfeited. If the Magistrate is satisfied

with the cause shown, he must restore the lorry to the owner. (at

page 43)

In the instant matter the offence committed is the alternation in the

chassis and engine numbers, the Magistrate has held in the Order

according to the government analyst report, the alteration has been

done locally, and according to the Motor Traffic Commissioner, at the

Page 8 of 9

point of registration the chassis and engine numbers are physically not

tallied but whatever number that appears on the chassis and engine, if

it tallies with the importation documents, the vehicle is dully registered.

Therefore, as the government analyst has detected a tampering of the

chassis and engine numbers the Magistrate has held that it is the

subject matter of an offence and as such it has to be forfeited.

Therefore, in view of the material stated above, the vehicle in question

has been imported to Sri Lanka in 1997. The current appellant had been

registered as the owner in 2007. Thereafter, there is no change of

registration with regards to ownership. The government analyst has

detected a tampering with regards to the chasse and engine numbers.

But the date of the said tampering is not known. The Motor Traffic

Commissioner had not detected any illegality in the documentation

submitted by the appellant at the time of registration. Therefore, it is a

duly registered vehicle in view of the provisions in the Motor Traffic Act.

But it is very clear that the chassis and engine numbers in the vehicle

has been tampered with, even though as pleaded by the appellant, he

has been a bona fide purchaser of the vehicle, the fact that the vehicle

has a altered chassis and engine numbers is an offence in terms of the

Motor Traffic Act and as such under section 425 of the CPC the subject

matter is liable for forfeiture.

In the case of Manawadu v AG, which is cited above the owner of the

vehicle has to satisfy the Court that he had taken all precautions to

avoid any illegal activity. In the instant case, although the vehicle has

not been used for illegal activity, there had been some illegal activity

committed on the vehicle as per the government Analyst report.

Therefore, at the time of the purchasing of the vehicle, the appellant

has an opportunity of checking all details about the vehicle. But, he has

failed to give any reason or explanation with regards to that. He has

pleaded ignorance. But, according to Section 114 (F) of the Evidence

Ordinance, casts a responsibility on the appellant to explain as to

whether he had any opportunity of examining the vehicle at the time of

purchase. In the absence of such explanation, this Court is unable to

agree with his mere denial of existence of any tampering in his vehicle

being truthful.

As such, this Court sees no illegality in the Order dated 13/12/2018 of

the Learned Magistrate of Colombo. As such, the instant appeal is

dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
