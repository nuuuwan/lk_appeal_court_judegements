However, unlike in the previous Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, no time frame has been specified in Section 139 for the CGIR to deliver his decision. Nevertheless, Section 140 provides that within thirty days from the date of the decision or upon lapse of ninety days from the request being made for an administrative review, the tax payer is entitled to make an appeal to the TAC. Hence, it is clear that while the breach of certain time limits is accompanied by remedies or sanctions, the breach of others is not. It should be noted that, under Section 144 of the 2017 Act, if the TAC fails either to determine or to respond to an appeal filed by a person within ninety days from the appeal request, the Appellant has the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal.",

In addition, upon the failure of the TAC to respond to an appeal request within the prescribed time frame, the Appellant has been granted a direct right of appeal to the Court of Appeal. Therefore, it can be seen that though the Legislature has in the case of the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017, introduced a remedy where the TAC fails to respond within the specified time limit; in the case of the TAC Act, despite twice availing itself of the opportunity to amend the law, the Legislature has not specified a remedy in case of non-compliance.",
