Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

These appeals are by the second, third, fourth and the fifth accused appellants

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as appellants) on being aggrieved by the

conviction and the sentence of them by the Learned High Court Judge of

Gampaha. The fourth accused appellant, namely Tennakon Arachchige Piyadasa

alias Lokka) had died during the pendency of the appeal. Therefore, it is the

appeals by the second, third and the fifth accused appellants that will be

considered in this appeal.

The appellants, along with one Tennakoon Arachchige Premathilaka alias

Chutiya (first accused) was indicted before the High Court of Gampaha on the

following counts:

1. For being members of an unlawful assembly on 14-11-1998 with the

intention of causing injuries to Thalkola Devage Sunil Munasighe, an

offence punishable in terms of Section 140 of the Penal Code.

2. Being members, of the unlawful assembly and causing the death of Sunil

Munasinghe at the same time and at the same incident, an offence

punishable in terms of Section 296 read with Section 146 of the Penal

Code.

3. At the same time and at the same incident causing cut injuries to Thalkola

Devage Indrani by the use of a sword while being members of the said

unlawful assembly, an offence punishable in terms of Section 315 read

with Section 146 of the Penal Code.

Page 4 of 14

4. At the same time and at the same incident committing the offence of

robbery of gold jewellery from the possession of earlier mentioned Thalkola

Devage Indrani while being members of the said Unlawful assembly, an

offence punishable in terms of Section 380 read with Section 146 of the

Penal Code.

5. At the same time and at the same incident causing the death of the earlier

mentioned Thalkola Devage Sunil Munasighe an offence punishable in

terms of Section 296 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

6. At the same time and at the same incident causing cut injuries by the use

of a sword to earlier mentioned Thalkola Devage Indrani an offence

punishable in terms of Section 315 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

7. At the same time and at the same incident committing the offence of

robbery on earlier mentioned Thalkola Devage Indrani, an offence

punishable in terms of Section 380 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

Since the first accused had died during the pendency of the trial, his name has

been removed from the list of accused and the indictment has been amended

accordingly by naming him as a person who is dead and acted along with the

other accused in committing the above-mentioned crimes.

After trial without a jury, the appellants were found guilty for the first, second

third and the fourth counts preferred against them. Since the other three counts

are counts that need to be considered as an alternative for the counts they were

found guilty, they have been acquitted of the said three counts by the Learned

High Court Judge of Gampaha by his judgment dated 19-10-2018.

Accordingly, they were sentenced as follows:

1. On count one- 6 months rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 5000/-,

in default 3 months imprisonment.

2. On count two- death sentence.

3. On count three- 3 years rigorous imprisonment, and a fine of Rs 5000/-,

in default 3 months imprisonment.

Page 5 of 14

4. On count four- 10 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 5000/-,

in default 3 months imprisonment.

The facts as elicited by way of evidence at the trial, in brief, are as follows:

PW-01 Thalkola Devage Indrani was at home around 4 and 5 p.m. on the date

of the incident, namely 14-11-1998. She was living there with her mother and

the brother who is the deceased. The deceased Sunil Munasighe was at home

and the second accused whom PW-01 identified as Podi Sunil has come and

called her brother to come with him. Her brother has willingly left their

compound with the earlier mentioned second accused and gone to the land in

front of their house which belonged to one Chamila and Janaka. The moment

the deceased reached the said land the first accused whom she identified as

Chutiya has attacked the deceased with a rock which has struck his head. It was

her evidence that he was hiding in the land and came and attacked her brother

as earlier mentioned.

This has resulted in the deceased being fallen onto the ground. At that time, the

earlier mentioned second accused has attacked the deceased with a sword which

he was concealing in his hand. At the same time, the third accused whom she

has identified as Jayasuriya although his name is Wijesuriya according to the

indictment, and the fourth accused whom she has identified as Lokka, and the

fifth accused whom she has identified as Chutta has all come and surrounded

the deceased and has assaulted him with swords.

Seeing what was happening, PW-01 has ran towards her brother and the second

accused, after uttering ? has assaulted her too, using the sword he

was carrying. Although she started to run away from the scene of the incident

the second accused has forcibly grabbed the gold chain and the bangle PW-01

was wearing at that time.

It was her evidence that their mother who was at home saw the incident as well,

but she is not in a position to give evidence as she is ill and unable to speak.

Page 6 of 14

Later, the witness has been admitted to the hospital and has come to know of

the death of her brother. It was her evidence when the second accused came and

spoke to her brother, he was seated in the front of their porch. It was also her

evidence at that time, there appeared to be no dispute between her brother and

the second accused and her brother willingly went out with him.

The Judicial Medical Officer (PW-05) has marked his postmortem report as P-03

at the trial. He has observed 14 injuries on the body of the deceased and all but

one of the injuries have been cut injuries. He has also examined PW-01 who

received injuries in this incident and has marked the medico-legal report relevant

to her as P-04. He has observed one cut injury on her.

The only other eye witness mentioned by PW-02 namely the mother of the

deceased was dead at the time the PW-01 has concluded her evidence.

Accordingly, her deposition at the Magistrate Court non-summary inquiry

number NS- 05-99 has been led as evidence, marked as P-06. The other

witnesses called at the trial are the police officers who conducted the

investigations into the incident.

At the conclusion of the prosecution evidence the Learned High Court Judge has

called for a defence from the accused appellant and all four accused including

the now deceased accused appellant has made dock statements. In their brief

dock statements, they have claimed that they are unaware of any of the incidents

and they are not guilty of the charges preferred against them.

Pronouncing his judgment, the Learned High Court Judge of Gampaha has

convicted the appellants as earlier mentioned and has sentenced them

accordingly.

At the hearing of the appeal, the Learned Counsel appearing for the second

accused formulated two grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

However, during the submissions he conceded that he is in no position to

maintain the 1st of the grounds of appeal, namely, the ground that the

Page 7 of 14

prosecution has failed to prove the death of PW-02 before adopting her deposition

in Court, since her death was an admitted fact at the trial.

His other ground of appeal is as follows:

1. There was an error in the Learned High Court Judges approach as to the

burden of proof which has caused a prejudice to the appellants.

The Learned Counsel appearing for the 3rd and the 5th accused appellants

formulated the following grounds of appeal.

2. The evidence lead at the trial does not support the ingredients of an

unlawful assembly against the third and the fifth accused appellants.

3. If the second ground of appeal succeeds the imputation of vicarious

liability on the appellants on the basis of common object should

necessarily fail.

4. The conviction of the third and the fifth accused appellants on count 03

and 04 preferred against them are legally flawed.

Making submissions in relation to the first ground of appeal urged, it was the

contention of the Learned Counsel for the second accused appellant that the

Learned High Court Judge who pronounced the judgement did not have the

benefit of listening to the evidence of the key witnesses. It was his position that

the Learned High Court Judge was misdirected when he commented at page 35

of the judgement (page 337 of the appeal brief) that:

.

.

It was his contention that by the above conclusion that the Learned High Court

Judge has considered that the prosecution has proved its case beyond

Page 8 of 14

reasonable doubt before he considered the defence of the appellants, which he

termed as a misdirection in law which has caused a prejudice to the appellants.

The main contention of the Learned Counsel for the second and the fifth accused

appellants was that to formulate an unlawful assembly by five or more persons

there must be evidence that the formation of such an assembly. It was her

argument that the evidence led in this case has established that the third, fourth

and the fifth accused have come to the place of the incident subsequent to the

initial attack and therefore it is clear that they have had no common object along

with the other accused. It was her position that the charge of unlawful assembly

should therefore necessarily fail, and as a result the conviction based on

unlawful assembly should also fail.

Replying to the submission of the learned Counsel for the accused, it was the

position of the Learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) for the respondent that

the main witness, namely PW-01 has given clear evidence to support that there

was an unlawful assembly with the participation of the five accused originally

named in the indictment.

It was also his submission that Learned High Court Judge has never shifted the

burden of proof to the appellants or has decided that the prosecution has proved

the case beyond reasonable doubt before considering defence put forward by the

appellants. It was his position that the Learned High Court Judge has well

considered the relevant facts and the law before reaching his verdict which needs

no disturbance from this court.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

First Ground of Appeal:

It is well settled law that in a criminal case an accused person need not prove

anything and it is the responsibility of the prosecution to prove its case beyond

reasonable doubt.

Page 9 of 14

It was held in the case of Pantis Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 148

that;

As the burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove its case beyond

reasonable doubt and no such duty is cast on the accused and its sufficient

for the accused to give an explanation which satisfies the Court or at least

is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.

In the appeal under consideration, although it was the argument of the Learned

Counsel for the first accused appellant that the approach of the Learned High

Court Judge on the burden of proof was not correct, I am in no position to agree

with this contention. It appears that the argument of the Learned Counsel is

based on the earlier mentioned comment by the Learned High Court Judge in

the judgement taken in its isolation. However, it is clear from the judgement that

the Learned High Court Judge has never shifted the burden of proof to the

accused appellant, He has always looked whether the evidence led by the

prosecution has proven the charges beyond a reasonable doubt against the

appellants. It is clear from the judgment that he was well aware that in a criminal

case an accused need not prove anything, and if there is a reasonable doubt

created as to the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, or at least a reasonable

explanation has been provided as against the evidence, the benefit of that should

to go to the accused.

The above comment by the Learned High Court Judge has been made in relation

to the short dock statements made by the accused appellants where they have

made a mere denial of the charges preferred against them which in any manner

are not reasonable explanations or creating a doubt as to the incriminating

evidence against them.

In this action the prosecution has led strong prima facie direct evidence to prove

the culpability of the appellants to the crime. Our Courts have consistently

followed the dictum commonly known as Ellenborough Dictum which is

Page 10 of 14

attributed Lord Ellenborough in Rex Vs. Cocharane (1814 Gurneyes Report

499) which reads:

no person accused of crime is bound to offer any explanation of his conduct

or of circumstances of suspicion which attach to him, but nevertheless but if

he refuses to do so where a strong prima facie case had been made out and

when it is in his power to offer evidence, if such exist in explanation of such

suspicious appearances, which would show them to be fallacious and

explicable consistency with his innocence, it is a reasonable and justifiable

conclusion that he refrains from doing so only from the conviction that the

evidence so suppressed or not adduced would operate adversely to his

interest.

I find that the Learned High Court Judge has commented as stated before

because of the mere denial of the charges by the accused appellants and not

because of the burden has been shifted to the appellants. I am of the view that

the said comment needs to be viewed in the total context of the evidence and the

judgment and not in its isolation.

If viewed in that context, it is clear that the Learned High Court Judge has not

shifted the burden of proof in any manner. Therefore, I find no merit in the first

ground of appeal urged by the learned counsel.

Second, Third and the fourth Grounds of Appeal:

As all the above grounds of appeal are interrelated, I will now proceed to consider

the said grounds of appeal together.

It was the argument of the learned counsel for the second and the fifth accused

appellants that the prosecution has failed to prove that all five accused indicted

before the High Court had the common object of causing the death of the

deceased since, if at all, the formation of the assembly had been after the

incident.

Page 11 of 14

The offence of unlawful assembly as described in Section 138 of the Penal Code

reads as follows:

138- An assembly of five or more persons is designated an "unlawful

assembly" if the common object of the persons composing that

assembly-

Firstly-To overawe by criminal force, or show of criminal force, the

State or Parliament or any public officer in the exercise of the lawful

power of such public officer; or

Secondly-To resist the execution of any law or of any legal process;

or

Thirdly-To commit any mischief or criminal trespass or other offence;

or

FourthlyBy means of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to

any person, to take or obtain possession of any property, or to deprive

any person or the public of the enjoyment of a right of way or of the

use of water or other incorporeal right of which such person or public

is in possession or enjoyment, or to enforce any right or supposed

right; or

FifthlyBy means of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to

compel any person to do what he is not legally bound to do, or to omit

to do what he is legally entitled to do; or

Sixthlythat the persons assembled, or any of them, may train or

drill themselves, or be trained or drilled to the use of arms, or

practising military movements or evolutions, without the consent of

the President.

Page 12 of 14

Section 139 of the Penal Code which refers to being a member of an unlawful

assembly reads as follows:

139- Whoever being aware of facts which render any assembly an

unlawful assembly, intentionally joins that assembly, or continues in

it, is said to be a member of an unlawful assembly.

The effect of this section has been well considered in the case of Kulathunga Vs.

Mudalihami 42 NLR 331 which reads thus:

That the prosecution must prove that there was an unlawful assembly with

a common object as stated in the charge. So far as each individual is

concerned it had to prove that he was a member of the assembly which he

intentionally joined and he knew the common object of the assembly.

The offence of unlawful assembly imputes vicarious liability on each member of

the assembly for things done by other members of the said assembly in

furtherance of the common object of the assembly. In terms of the Section for

vicarious liability to be imputed on the member of an unlawful assembly the

prosecution must prove either:

a) That the offence was committed in prosecution of the common

objective of the unlawful assembly or

b) That the members of the unlawful assembly knew the offence was

likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object (Vide

Andrayes V the Queen 67 NLR 425).

Dr Gour in his book Penal Law of India has discussed the principles applicable

in relation to the offence of unlawful assembly in the following terms (Vol II page

1296 11th edition)

All persons who convened or who take part in the proceeds in an unlawful

assembly are guilty of the offence of taking part in an unlawful assembly.

Persons present by accident or by curiosity alone without taking any part in

the proceedings are not guilty of the offence even though those persons

Page 13 of 14

possess the power of stopping the assembly and failed to exercise it. Mere

presence in an assembly does not make such a person a member of an

unlawful assembly unless it is shown he has done something or he has

omitted to do something, which would make him a member of an unlawful

assembly or unless the case fails.

In this matter the evidence clearly establishes the fact that it was the second

accused appellant who came and met the deceased in order to lure the deceased

out of his house. It is clear that he has come for that purpose as a part of a wider

plan of taking him out of his house. The deceased has accompanied the second

accused appellant to the land situated opposite to his house without suspecting

the bona fides of him. At that time, the occupants of that land were not at their

home. The PW-03 has seen that the moment deceased entered the land the first

accused who has been waiting in hiding expecting the deceased striking him on

his head.

It is clear that he was waiting in hiding before the deceased was lured into the

land. Once the deceased was struck with a rock and fell, the rest of the accused

appellants who were also on that land has come and attacked the deceased using

swords along with the second appellant who also attacked the deceased using a

sword, which he has kept concealed, even when at the time he came to the house

of the deceased.

This provides ample proof beyond reasonable doubt that the object of all the

appellants and the first accused was to attack and kill the deceased. I am in no

position to agree with the contention of the learned Counsel that acts of the

appellants are independent to each other and, therefore, unlawful assembly has

not been proved.

I am of the view that the evidence placed before the Court has provided evidence

beyond reasonable doubt that this was an act committed with a common

objective in mind.

Page 14 of 14

Evidence also provides that after attacking the deceased, the PW-03 who came

to rescue him was also attacked with a sword and the gold jewellery she was

wearing was robbed in furtherance of the common objective by those who formed

the unlawful assembly.

For the reasons adduced as above, I am of the view that the grounds of appeal

urged on behalf of the second and fifth accused appellants are also devoid of any

merit.

The appeals of the second, third and the fifth accused appellants are dismissed,

as I find no merit in them.

The conviction and the sentence of them by the Learned High Court Judge of

Gampaha is hereby affirmed.
