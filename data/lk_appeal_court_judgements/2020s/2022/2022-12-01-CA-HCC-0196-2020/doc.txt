JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred as the Appellant)

was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of Colombo under

Sections 54A (d) and 54A (b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance as amended by Act No.13 of 1984 for the Trafficking and

Possession of respectively 29.711 grams of Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) on 16th

August 2018.

After trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the Learned

High Court Judge of Colombo has sentenced him to death on the 10th of

September 2020.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. During the argument he has been connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

3 | P a g e

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant had raised following appeal

grounds.

1. That the learned trial Judge has failed to evaluate the deficiencies in

the evidence of PW1, PW4 and thereby has overlooked the weaknesses

in the prosecution case.

2. That the learned trial Judge had failed to consider the improbabilities

of the version of the prosecution.

3. That the learned trial Judge has failed to consider the evidence with

regard to the chain of custody in correct perspective.

4. The rejection of the defence was contrary to law.

5. The prosecution had led bad character evidence during the trial.

At the trial, PW1 SI/Chrishantha, PW4 PC 67490 Janaka, PW6 PC 45781

Priyantha, PW08 PS 17894 Athauda, PW14 PS 17260 Bandara, PW15 PC

44076 Bandula, PW16 PS 7060 Premachandra, and PW18 PC 71271

Karunaratna had given evidence on behalf of the prosecution and marked

production P1-11. The Government Analyst Report was admitted under

Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. The Appellant gave

evidence from witness box and closed the case.

Background of the case

According to PW1, he was attached to the Anti-Corruption Unit which

functioned under the Harbour Police Station. On 15/08/2018, while he was

engaged in his usual daily official duties, he had patrolled to Kotahena,

Modera, Dematagoda and Thotalanga with a team of police officers to detect

illegal substances. At about 12.00 midnight, his team had come to

Hingurukade Junction and stopped their van facing to Kelanitissa Power

House. He had used a white coloured van for this purpose.

While they remained in the van, they had noticed a person clad in white

coloured T-shirt and blue coloured trouser coming towards Hingurukade

Junction from the direction of Bandaranayeke round aboard approaching

4 | P a g e

them. As his movements seemed to be suspicious, two officers had got down

from the van and went across the road and apprehended the person before

he could run after seen them. At that time the person had something in his

hands and had tried to hide it. When he was interrogated, the person had

very reluctantly handed over a small parcel which had been wrapped in a

red coloured grocery cover to PW1.

When the said grocery cover was checked by PW1 some brown coloured

substance was found which he identified as Heroin relying on his experience

in dealing with narcotics. The Appellant was taken into custody immediately

for further investigation. As the information given by the Appellant, the police

team had waited there anticipating a person named Rupasinghe. As he did

not show up the team had gone to Peliyagoda to check the house of said

Rupasinghe. After checking the said house, the police team had gone to

Grandpass Police Station to weigh the production recovered from the

Appellant. The said production was in the custody of PW2, PC 30570

Bandara after the detection. At the Grandpass Police Station the production

was weighed in front of the Appellant and the weight of the substance had

been 220 grams. The said production was sealed with the thumb impression

of the Appellant and handed over to reserve police officer PC 45781 Priyantha

of the Grandpass Police Station.

PW4, PC 67490 Weeratunga had corroborated the evidence of PW1 properly.

The prosecution had called PW6, PC 45781 Priyantha, PW8, PS 17894

Athauda, PW14, PS 17260 Bandara, PW15, PC 44076 Wijebandara and

PW16, PS 7060 Premachandra regarding handling of the production of this

case before it was taken to the Government Analyst Department.

PW18, PC 71271 Karunaratna had taken the production to the Government

Analyst Department and marked the receipt as P10 in the trial.

5 | P a g e

At the trial, both parties had agreed to admit the Government Analyst Report

under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Hence, it was

marked as P11 by the prosecution.

According to the Government Analyst Report, 26.711 grams of pure Heroin

(diacetylmorphine) had been detected from the substance which was

subjected for analysis.

When the prosecution had closed the case after leading the prosecution

witnesses mentioned above, the defence was called, and the Appellant had

given evidence from the witness box.

As the appeal grounds raised under 01 and 02 are interconnected, both

would be considered together in the judgment.

The Counsel for the Appellant contended that the Learned High Court Judge

had failed to evaluate the contradictory evidence of PW1 and PW4 with regard

to weighing and sealing of production allegedly found in the possession of

the Appellant.

Considering the evidence given by PW1 and PW4 with regard to sealing of

production, both had confirmed that the suspected substance first had been

put into a shopping cover which had been taken along with the police team

when they left for the raid. The shopping cover which was used by the police

weighed about 400 milligrams. The total weight of the substance showed

220.400 grams with the cover. Hence the net weight recovered from the

Appellant is 220 grams which had been properly sealed and handed over to

the reserve police officer of the Grandpass Police Station. The witnesses PW1

and PW4 had not contradicted regarding evidence pertains to sealing of the

production in this case.

According to PW1, on that day the police team had been assigned to detect

narcotic around Colombo city. Accordingly, they had gone around Colombo

city and had come to Hingurukade Junction at about 12.00 midnight and

6 | P a g e

arrested the Appellant along with Heroin. This evidence had been properly

corroborated by PW4.

Although PW1 had put notes that the team had taken sealing equipment

along with them, but the sealing was done at the Grandpass Police Station

using the sealing equipment available there. The Counsel for the Appellant

contended that not taking sealing equipment by PW1 creates a doubt

regarding the detection of Heroin from the Appellant. This contention cannot

be accepted as PW1 had used sealing equipment which was available at the

Grandpass Police Station.

After the arrest of the Appellant, the police team had gone to Peliyagoda to

check a house. As they were not successful, PW1 had not put detailed notes

and did not include the address of the house. Although the Learned Counsel

for the Appellant argues that not taking down the address of the house is a

serious lapse on part of the investigation, I conclude it is not a serious lapse

as contended by the Counsel for the Appellant.

The grounds of appeal 01 and 02 have no merit as the Learned High Court

Judge had very extensively discussed the evidence of PW1 and PW4 and

accepted as trustworthy.

In the third ground of appeal, the Learned Counsel for the Appellant

contends that the learned trial Judge has failed to consider the evidence with

regard to the chain of custody in its correct perspective.

In this case the prosecution had called all the police officers who handled

production of this case until it reached the Government Analyst Department.

PW06 the reserve duty officer had first received the production from PW1 on

16/08/2018 and marked it as PR 2988/2018. Thereafter, PW08, PW14,

PW15 and PW16 who functioned as reserve duty officers had taken charge

of the production time to time. All such times, necessary entries had been

put in the relevant book. Finally, PW18 had received the production pertains

to this case and had taken it to the Government Analyst Department on

7 | P a g e

23/08/2018 and marked the receipt as P10 in the trial. The defence had

cross examined all the witnesses who took charge of the production but

could not raise any doubt on their evidence. Further, the defence had

admitted the Government Analyst Report as an admission and marked it

without calling the Government Analyst in the trial. The Government Analyst

confirmed in his report that he received the production in a sealed envelope.

Hence no adverse evidence had been led on the production which had been

sent to Government Analyst Department. I conclude that the learned trial

Judge has considered the evidence with regard to the chain of custody in its

correct perspective. Hence this ground of appeal also sans any merit.

As the Learned Counsel for the Appellant had not contested the fourth

ground of appeal, now I consider the final ground of appeal hereafter. In his

final ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the prosecution had led

bad character evidence during the trial.

But on perusal of the entire court record and the judgment nowhere found

any evidence of bad character in nature had creeped into the proceedings.

The Learned Trial Judge nowhere put question from bench to impeach the

character of the Appellant. The Learned Trial Judge after considering all the

evidence presented by both parties had come to a decision to accept the

prosecution version as credible and rejected the defence case. Hence, it is

not true that bad character evidence had creeped into the court proceedings.

Therefore, this ground of appeal also has no merit.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person. In a case of this

nature, the prosecution needs to not only prove the case beyond reasonable

doubt with cogent and believable evidence sans any contradictions or

omissions but should also ensure that the arrest, detection, weighing and

sending the substance for analysis is conducted with accordance to due

process which will otherwise affect the root of the case.

8 | P a g e

In this case, the Learned High Court Judge had accurately analysed and

considered the evidence presented by both parties and arrived at a proper

finding.

Considering all the evidence presented during the trial, I conclude that the

prosecution has proven the case beyond reasonable doubt. I further conclude

that this is not an appropriate case in which to interfere with the decision of

the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 10/09/2020.

Hence, the appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
