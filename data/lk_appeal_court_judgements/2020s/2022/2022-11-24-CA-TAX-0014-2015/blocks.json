He can reject accounts which he believes to be false and unreliable although there is no direct or reliable evidence to prove them incorrect.37 The sufficiency of the reason given for rejecting the accounts cannot be questioned; except in the course of an appeal against the assessment. The omission of a single item of receipt from the accounts is a sufficient reason for rejecting the account if the omission cannot be explained. The intentional omission of an item entitles the assessor to conclude that the account cannot be relied upon to show the whole of the trading profit.38",

The claim of the Appellant is for a sum of Rs. 3,446,008.00 for the year of assessment 2009/2010. This is approximately Rs. 287,167.00 per month. In appeal the CGIR rejected the Appellants claim for the deduction of meals expenses on the ground that no documents were produced to prove the expenses. There may be instances where valid reasons other than the reason upon which the Assessor rejected the return, which were not known to the Assessor at the time the return was rejected exist. It is therefore possible that the reasons on which the CGIR or the TAC confirm or reject the Assessor's assessment are different from the reasons given by the Assessor himself. E. Gooneratne, in his book titled Income Tax in Sri Lanka, expressed the same view in this regard40.",

However, as correctly submitted by the Appellant, Section 106(13) of the IR Act does not place an onus on the Appellant to produce such documents. The Section empowers an Assessor or Assistant Commissioner to give written notice to the taxpayer to produce the necessary documents etc. No doubt a taxpayer has a duty to oblige. Nevertheless, there is no burden imposed upon the taxpayer by the Section itself. Therefore, in my view, the TAC was mistaken in stating that Section 106(13) of the IR Act places a burden on the Appellant to provide documentation to support meals expenses. Yet, in my view, the above misstatement has not affected the final determination of the TAC on meals expenses. Although the Section does not impose that burden, it is the Appellant who should displace the assessment by providing the necessary evidence.",
