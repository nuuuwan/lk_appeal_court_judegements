The instant application was filed by the Petitioner Company (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Project Proponent) on the 22nd of June 2022 to invoke this Courts writ

jurisdiction in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution to quash by writs of Certiorari the

decisions evinced in the documents marked P6 (dated 22nd May 2018) and P16b (dated

09th September 2019) by which the 2nd Respondent refused environmental approval for the

project and the 4th Respondent affirmed the decision of the 2nd Respondent to refuse project

approval, respectively.

The Petitioner Company was duly incorporated under the Companies Act No. 17 of

1982 on the 12th of April 2005 for the purpose of installing on grid on renewable energy

projects, utilizing identified renewable energy resources in the country. It sought to construct

a 1000 kW mini-hydro project on Punakanda Oya situated at Mount Vernon in Pathana,

Nuwara-Eliya. The electrical energy produced at this facility was to be purchased by the

Ceylon Electricity Board as per the Standardised Power Purchase Agreement between

Ceylon Electricity Board and the Petitioner Company dated 21st May 2008 marked P4.

In order to obtain environmental approval, the Petitioner Company submitted an

application along with an Initial Environmental Examination Report to the Central

Environmental Authority (the 1st Respondent) in 2007. By the document marked P2 dated

15th June 2007 the Central Environmental Authority, as the project approving agency,

granted approval to the Petitioner Company to implement the project, subject to the terms

and conditions stated therein. The approval was said to be valid for a period of three years

from the date of issuance. The Petitioner contends that this approval to implement the project

was final. The land had to be acquired for this purpose, and the Petitioner Company was

informed by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (the 3rd Respondent), the relevant

authority tasked with acquiring the land, that it had to pay a sum of Rs. 300,000/- as 50% of

the expenses likely to be incurred in the land acquisition process, which it paid. The

Petitioner Company had to apply to extend the approval granted by the Central

Environmental Authority since the acquisition of the land for the project was in progress.

Page 4 of 10

The initial extension (in 2011) was granted, however, the second extension applied for on the

12th of February 2016 declined.

On 22nd May 2018, the Petitioner Company was informed by the Provincial Director,

Central Province of the Central Environmental Authority, by the impugned letter marked

P6, that environmental approval was cancelled. This letter states that following a

monitoring meeting held on the 20th of March 2018 the Technical Evaluation Committee

decided to refuse approval on the basis that the Punakanda waterfall, listed in the 2015

waterfall list, which is situated in between the proposed weir and the powerhouse can be

affected. The Petitioner contends that this reason is arbitrary and without any basis mainly

because the said waterfall was not listed in the waterfall lists of 2011 and 2017, and,

additionally, initial approval was granted by the Central Environmental Authority in 2007

(along with other approvals of the Nuwara Eliya Pradeshiya Sabha P9, the Water Supply

and Drainage Board P10) after having undertaken a comprehensive study. The Petitioner

pleads that it was on this approval that the then Minister of Power and Energy issued a

Generation License to the Petitioner Company on 03rd July 2007 to build, own, operate and

maintain a Mini Hydro Power Station to generate electrical energy by using the hydropower

potential of Punakanda Oya (marked P11).

This Court would like to highlight one condition in approval marked P2, as discussed

below, which the Petitioner Company itself informed was practically impossible marked

R1.

The Petitioner appealed the decision to cancel approval to the Secretary of the

Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment (the 4th Respondent). Consequently, an

inquiry was conducted. The 4th Respondent affirmed the decision of the 2nd Respondent. The

reasons as set out in the document marked P16b state:

As the Petitioner Company has prayed for a Writ of Certiorari the starting point is

the often-cited dictum of Lord Atkin in Rex v. Electricity Commissioners, Ex parte London

Electricity Joint Committee Co. [1924] 1 K.B. 171:

Whenever any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions

affecting the rights of subjects and having the duty to act judicially, act in excess of their

legal authority they are subject to the controlling jurisdiction of the King's Bench Division

exercised in these writs.

Page 6 of 10

The Atkinian formula was revised by Lord Diplock in OReilly v. Mackman [1982] 3

WLR 1096 by dropping the words having the duty to act judicially. Lord Diplock held:

this phrase gave rise to many attempts, with varying success, to draw subtle

distinctions between decisions that were quasi-judicial and those that were administrative

only. But the relevance of arguments of this kind was destroyed by the decision of this House

in Ridge v. Baldwin [1964] A.C. 40, where again the leading speech was given by Lord Reid.

Wherever any person or body of persons has authority conferred by legislation to make

decisions of the kind I have described, it is amenable to the remedy of an order to quash its

decision either for error of law in reaching it or for failure to act fairly towards the person

who will be adversely affected

Administrative law, the core of which is judicial review, is primarily intended to, in

the words of Wade and Forsyth (Administrative Law 11th Edition) keep the powers of

government within their legal bounds, so as to protect the citizen against their abuse. The

powerful engines of authority must be prevented from running amok.

The classical statement of the grounds of judicial review by Lord Diplock in the

landmark judgment of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service [1985]

AC 374 (often referred to as the GCHQ case") sets forth that the principle of judicial review

of administrative action is based upon one or more of the following, viz. legality, procedural

impropriety, and irrationality. Proportionality was envisaged as a future possibility.

Thus, if a decision is found to be vitiated by illegality, irrationality, procedural

impropriety, or is found to be disproportionate, the decision would be nullified.

In terms of the initial approval granted by the Central Environmental Authority on

15th June 2007, which granted environmental approval subject to the terms and conditions

therein, a specific condition is Clause B.2.1. states:

The Project Proponent should undertake to release an adequate volume of water

down stream for maintaining a healthy ecology and for utility of down stream users. To

maintain the downstream in proper condition a continuous uninterrupted discharge of 500

l/s (base flow of the river) should be released to the downstream from the weir by means of

uncontrolled outlets made in several places of the weir to cover the entire width of the river..

Page 7 of 10

The Petitioner Company by a letter dated 4th October 2007 (marked R1) to the

Central Environmental Authority states that this condition is practically impossible to

maintain as the 80% of the year, the river flow will be less than 500 l/s. A request is made

to revise the expected minimum discharge from the weir to more pragmatic levels.

In the Counter Affidavit, it is stated that fixing the e-flow at 500 l/s is a fundamental

flaw and defeats the basic norm scientifically determined by experimental verifications. The

Petitioner Company contends that the scientific details arrived at using e-flow at 500

liters/sec. is erroneous. Much ink was spilled trying to prove to this Court that this condition

is erroneous and lacks scientific reasoning.

The Petitioner Company may or may not be right in this contention. Yet, for a Court

of law exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, it is well beyond our institutional competence

to make such a determination. As mentioned above, our supervisory role is circumscribed to

the ordinary grounds of judicial review. In the absence of an allegation of the same, we cannot

step into the shoes of an expert. This is a well-established position in Administrative Law,

the reason being that this Court does not have the benefit of expert evidence to help arrive

at the right conclusion. This is a matter that must be litigated in a forum in which expert

opinion may be tried and tested.

Another factor that disentitles the Petitioner Company to claim the relief sought is

the fact of futility. Suppose if this Court were to quash the decisions of the 2nd Respondent to

refuse environmental approval for the project and the 4th Respondents affirmation of the

decision of the 2nd Respondent to refuse project approval, the Petitioner Company would still

be unable to meet this impossible condition. There is no undertaking that this condition can

be met.

In the case of P.S. Bus Co. v. Members and Secretary of Ceylon Transport Board 61

NLR 491 his Lordship Sinnetamby J. held:

The prerogative writs are not issued as a matter of course and it is in the discretion

of Court to refuse to grant it if the facts and circumstances are such as to warrant a refusal.

A writ, for instance, will not issue where it would be vexatious or futile.

Page 8 of 10

His Lordship Soza J. in Siddeek v. Jacolyn Seneviratne [1984] 1 SLR 83 held:

The Court will have regard to the special circumstances of the case before it before

issuing a writ of certiorari. The writ of certiorari clearly will not issue where the end result

will be futility, frustration, injustice and illegality.

Further, Petitioner Company has other battles to win, especially the acquisition of the

land for this project. This is a fact recognized by the Petitioner Company itself which stated

in its Counter Affidavit to the Statement of Objections of the 1st and 2nd Respondents (in

paragraph 8) that the mere grant of environmental approval alone will not allow him to

implement the project without the land. The land has to be acquired which is not done by the

3rd Respondent.

The lease-holder of the land has not even been made a party to the instant action. In

their Statement of Objection, the Respondents have taken the objection that necessary

parties such were not before this Court, yet the Petitioner Company never sought the

permission of the Court to add them as parties. In a recent Order in Rev. Uturawala

Dhammaratana Thero v. Minister of Education, CA Writ 399/2020 decided on 29.07.2020, I

agreed with my brother Justice D.N. Samarakoon that the remedy for an alleged failure to

add a party is to allow the addition of that party and to have a full hearing but not to dismiss

the case at the very commencement. However, this statement must be read in the context

and circumstances of that case, which was in its preliminary stage, concerning the issuing or

not of notice. In the instant case, this matter has progressed to the merits stage and has been

reserved for judgment.

Before we conclude, it must be stated that the Central Environmental Authority and

other agencies tasked with the protection and preservation of the environment must act more

vigilantly and prudently. If the project does in fact pose a threat to the environment and could

cause severe degradation it is appalling how approval (and a subsequent extension) could be

granted in the first place.

We are reminded of the landmark Eppawela Case (Bulankulama v. Secretary,

Ministry of Industrial Development [2000] 3 SLR 243) in which his Lordship Amerasinghe J.

citing the Rio Declaration held that in order to achieve sustainable development

environmental protection shall constitute an integral part of the development process.

Page 9 of 10

His Lordship held, The organs of the State are guardians to whom the people have

committed the care and preservation of the resources of the people. This accords not only

with the scheme of government set out in the Constitution but also with the high and

enlightened conceptions of the duties of our rulers, in the efficient management of resources

in the process of development.

Her Ladyship Shiranee Tilakawardane J. in Sugathapala Mendis v. Chandrika

Kumaratunga [2008] 2 SLR 339 summarises the Public Trust Doctrine thus:

The "Public Trust Doctrine" is based on the concept that the powers held by organs

of government are, in fact, powers that originate with the People, and are entrusted to the

Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary only as a means of exercising governance and

with the sole objective that such powers will be exercised in good faith for the benefit of the

People of Sri Lanka. Public power is not for personal gain or favour, but always to be used to

optimize the benefit of the People. To do otherwise would be to betray the trust reposed by

the People within whom, in terms of the Constitution, the Sovereignty reposes. Power

exercised contrary to the Public Trust Doctrine would be an abuse of such power and in

contravention of the Rule of Law.

Thus, the Central Environmental Authority and other environmental agencies as

organs of the state must remember that the environment must be protected and preserved

for the benefit of the present generation and generations yet unborn. It is worth reiterating

Article 27(14) of the Constitution which provides: The State shall protect, preserve and

improve the environment for the benefit of the community. Although it is expressly declared

in the Constitution that the Directive principles and fundamental duties do not confer or

impose legal rights or obligations and are not enforceable in any Court of Tribunal Courts

have linked the Directive principles to the public trust doctrine and have stated that these

principles should guide state functionaries in the excise of their powers. (Vide Environmental

Foundation Ltd. v. Mahawali Authority of Sri Lanka [2010] 1 SLR 1)

Thus, we are unable to grant the relief prayed for because it is beyond this Courts

institutional competence to make a judgment as to the environmental impact this project can

cause, as claimed by the Respondents. Even if the waterfall is listed, its close proximity to

one that is, and the potential or actual impact on the environment is a matter for a more

appropriate forum.

Page 10 of 10

I am mindful that the outcome of this project is said to be effective for 100 days of the

year, and the need for a continuous supply of electricity to meet the countrys daily

requirement and the Court should not be an obstacle in a genuine effort to meet that demand.

However, when compared to the potential or actual environmental destruction, whether the

right balance in the cost-benefit analysis has been struck is doubtful.

The Indian Supreme Court in Narmada Bachao Andolan v. Union of India 2000 (10)

SCC 664 held:

When there is a state of uncertainty due to lack of data or material about the extent

of damage or pollution likely to be caused then, in order to maintain the ecology balance, the

burden of proof that the said balance will be maintained must necessarily be on the industry

or the unit which is likely to cause pollution. On the other hand where the effect on ecology

or environment of setting up of an industry is known, what has to be seen is that if the

environment is likely to suffer, then what mitigative steps can be taken to off set the same.

Merely because there will be a change is no reason to presume that there will be ecological

disaster. It is when the effect of the project is known then the principle of sustainable

development would come into play which will ensure that mitigative steps are and can be

taken to preserve the ecological balance. Sustainable development means what type or extent

of development can take place which can be sustained by nature/ecology with or without

mitigation.

For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss this application without costs.
