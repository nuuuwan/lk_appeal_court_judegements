This case was argued on 18.05.2022. However, both parties informed Court that that they were

still pursuing a settlement. On 09.08.2022 the Petitioner submitted that they failed to arrive at a

settlement.

4

The facts of the case are briefly as follows, the Petitioner states that his elder brother Harry

Manawadu in or about the year 1975 first obtained a Retail license for the sale of foreign liquor

(including locally made malt liquor) not to be consumed on the premises and a License for the

sale of arrack by the bottle only (not to be consumed on the premises) in foreign liquor retail

(off) licensed premises. The Petitioner alleges that in or about the year 1985, the Petitioners

name was also included in the above licenses as a co-licensee with the consent of the aforesaid

Harry Manawadu and with the approval of the Secretary of Finance and Planning, under which

Ministry, the Department of Excise functions.

The Petitioner states following the death of his brother on 14.05.1988, the Deputy Commissioner

of Excise informed the Government Agent of Galle to remove the name of Harry Manawadu the

deceased brother of the Petitioner. The Petitioner states that thereafter from 1989 to 1995, the

Petitioner carried on the business of retail, selling alcohol as the sole licensee on annual licenses

issued by the Government Agent of Galle as the licensing authority. In 1994, when the Petitioner

applied for a license for the year 1995, he was only granted a license valid till 30.04.1995 rather

than a license for one year. Thereafter his request to extend the license had been refused by the

then Divisional Secretary, which resulted in the Petitioner having to close down his business.

It was the contention of the Petitioner that, when he applied for applications to seek licenses for

the years 1996 to 2000, it was refused without any legally valid reason. During this period his

business remained closed. In the absence of any reason being given in the year 2000, a Writ

Application bearing No. 1090/2000 was filed by the Petitioner seeking writs of certiorari and

mandamus inter alia compelling the Respondents in the said application to issue him application

forms to obtain licenses. The Petitioner states that by order dated 12.12.2002, this Court ordered

the Respondents in Writ Application No. 1090/2000 to issue application forms to the Petitioner

to enable him to apply for the licenses for the year 2003, which were issued and duly filled in by

the Petitioner on 24.12.2002. The Petitioner further submitted that by judgment dated

15.07.2003, this Court had directed the predecessor in the office of the 1st Respondent to consider

the application made by the Petitioner for the issuance of an F.L.4 license and to take a decision

in terms of the guidelines. The Petitioner states that he was then issued the licenses until

5

31.12.2003. Thereafter, he obtained the necessary licenses and tax clearance certificates for the

years 2004 2012 and carried out his business without any hindrance.

In June 2012, the Petitioner received a letter dated 30.05.2012 from the 5th Respondent which

informed the Petitioner of an inquiry pertaining to the ownership of the foreign liquor store

belonging to the deceased Harry Manawadu. He had been unable to attend the inquiry on

13.06.2012 and it had been postponed to 27.06.2012. At the inquiry, he became aware that the 8th

Respondent, the widow of his deceased brother was the complainant. The Petitioner alleges that

it was accepted by the Respondents that the Petitioner was the legal owner of the said licenses

and on compassionate grounds, the Petitioner agreed to provide a monthly sum of Rs 10,000/-

per month to his sister-in-law, the 8th Respondent, and niece which was agreed by all.

The 1st Respondent by letter dated 29.08.2013 had informed him that the 7th Respondent had

requested a clarification on the ownership of the liquor license following the death of Harry

Manawadu. The Petitioner states that the letter of the 7th Respondent was not made available to

him. Neither had he been formally informed whether there are any charges leveled against him,

pertaining to the dispute. Further, he submitted that he had not been served with any charge

sheet, but only a clarification has been sought on the ownership.

The Petitioner had then sent a letter dated 26.09.2013 to the 1st Respondent regarding an

application made by the Petitioner to include the name of the Petitioners wife as a co-licensee of

the F. L. 4 license in 2012, but it is alleged that no action has been taken by the 1st Respondent.

The Petitioner states that the 4th Respondent acting on a letter dated 17.12.2012 by the 1st

Respondent, informed the 6th Respondent to issue a liquor license to the Petitioner valid only

from 01.01.2014 31.03.2014. The Petitioner had written to the 1st Respondent requesting the

license to be extended from 01.04.2014 31.04.2014. The Petitioner alleges that by conduct, the

1st Respondent has refused to extend the licenses for the remaining 9 months.

Following this, in 2014, the Petitioner had been informed that the Presidential Investigation Unit

upon inquiry, had discovered that the Petitioner had obtained his license by fraud and by

presenting false facts and that his license has not been legally conferred. On the said facts and on

the advice of the Attorney General, the F.L. 4 license issued to the Petitioner was suspended with

6

immediate effect. The Petitioner states that by letter marked as P33, the license issued had been

cancelled under section 27 of the Excise Ordinance.

Petitioners complaint to Court

The Petitioner complains that the cancellation of his license reflected in P33 by the

Respondents is ultra vires the provisions of the Excise Ordinance No. 8 of 1912 (as

amended);

The 7th Respondent has no power/jurisdiction to conduct the purported inquiry or cancel

and/or recommend the suspension/cancellation of the Petitioners licenses and therefore

the decision to cancel the Petitioners licenses is nullity and void ab initio;

The 1st Respondent has illegally surrendered and/or abdicated his discretion/power to the

7th Respondent who has no power to conduct the inquiry or cancel and/or recommend

cancellation of the Petitioners licenses; under the exercise ordinance

The suspension of the licenses is procedurally flawed.

The Petitioners main grievance is that before his license was canceled, there had been no inquiry

held against him by the Excise Department and that he had not been granted an opportunity to

reply.

The Petitioner filed this writ application and prays for the following reliefs:

oGrant and issue an order in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision to

cancel the Petitioners licenses reflected in P33.

oGrant and issue an order in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing P33.

oGrant and issue an order in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing license/s if any,

granted to the 8th Respondent and/or added Respondents.

7

oGrant and issue an order in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the

1st, 4th and 6th Respondents (reflected in P29) not to extend the licenses and/or grant the

licenses, for the period of 9 months from 01.04.2014 to 31.12.2014.

oGrant and issue an order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st -6th

Respondents to issue the Petitioner a retail license for the sale of foreign liquor

(including locally made malt liquor) not to be consumed on the premises and a license

for the sale of arrack by the bottle only (not to be consumed on the premises) in foreign

liquor retail (off) licensed premises for the period of 9 months from 01.04.2014 to

31.12.2014.

oGrant and issue an order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st -6th

Respondents to issue the Petitioner a retail license for the sale of foreign liquor

(including locally made malt liquor) not to be consumed on the premises and a license

for the sale of arrack by the bottle only (not to be consumed on the premises) in foreign

liquor retail (off) licensed premises for the period of 9 months from the date of

Judgement of Your Lordships Court in this application, subject to the further extensions

according to law.

oGrant and issue an order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st -6th

Respondents to issue the Petitioner a retail license for the sale of foreign liquor

(including locally made malt liquor) not to be consumed on the premises and a license

for the sale of arrack by the bottle only (not to be consumed on the premises) in foreign

liquor retail (off) licensed premises for the period of one year from the date of

Judgement of Your Lordships Court in this application, subject to the further extensions

according to law

The Respondents while denying the allegations raised by the Petitioner, took several preliminary

objections to the maintainability of this application. They are as follows;

The Petitioner has not followed the Court of Appeal Rules

8

The application is misconceived in law

The Petitioner is guilty of laches

The Petitioner has misrepresented facts and failed to disclose material facts to the Court

The Petitioners conduct does not warrant the grant of a discretionary writ

The application is futile

This Court will consider the said objections in due course.

It is common ground that liquor licenses are issued annually with a validity period of only one

year. It is also not disputed that the Petitioners older brother Harry Manawadu had been the

original owner of the license which dates back to the year 1975. The contention of the Petitioner

is that in or around 1985 the brother had named him as a co-licensee. This fact was denied by the

Respondents and contended that to name a co-licensee there is a procedure to be followed,

especially, a set of forms that should have been tendered. In the absence of such forms, the

Respondents contended that the Petitioner had through illegal means got himself registered as a

co-licensee.

The Petitioner responded by submitting the documents P3(a) and P3(b), which are copies of the

license issued by the Excise Department for the year 1985, with an addition to the name where

the Petitioners name has been added and the said addition has been initialed with a signature and

a seal placed. The Petitioner has also submitted a letter(P3(c)) sent to the Excise Commissioner

from the Finance Ministry, where approval has been granted to shift the licensed premises to a

place that is situated 75 yards away. The said letter refers to both the licensee and the co-licensee

and is copied to both the licensee and the co-licensee. Thus, this letter establishes that in 1987

there had been the original licensee as well as the co-licensee. This also establishes that the

premises originally started by Harry Manawadu had been shifted to another location. The letter is

dated 25.06.1987. Thereafter, the premises seems to have been shifted to another location as per

P6(a) and P6(b), both licenses issued to an address at No. 13 Baddegama road, Gonapinuwala.

While the licenses issued to Harry Manawadu for the years 76,77 and 78 give a different address

[P(a), P(b), P(c), P(d)].

As per P4, Harry Manawadu, the original licensee died in the year 1988 in the month of May.

Thus, it is clear that in the absence of any contrary evidence placed before this Court, the

premises had been shifted while the original licensee was alive and had to be done with his

9

knowledge. The Petitioner has submitted another document executed by the Deputy Excise

Commissioner where he has instructed the government agent of Galle to delete the name of the

deceased Harry Manawadu from the license(P5). The contents of the letter state as follows,

2. 1988.05.14

, ,

.

3.

.

This Court was not presented with any evidence to demonstrate how this information came to the

possession of the said Assistant Government Agent, especially following the fact that there is no

last will executed and the said Harry Manawadu had died intestate. However subsequent to this

letter, the license had been issued bearing only the name of the Petitioner (P7(a)). It is pertinent

to observe that this license bears the date 88 December 30, valid for the year 1989. Thus, in our

view, the Petitioner has established that he had been in possession of a valid license in his name

from the year 1987 and it was the Petitioners contention that he had operated the said business

from 1989 to 1995 as a single license holder. In 1995, he closed his business as his license had

not been extended. Subsequent to filing a writ application, the Petitioner had once again

commenced his business activities from 2004 till 2012. Even though the application for this

license was not tendered to the Court, it was submitted that the said license was issued to the

Petitioner as the sole license holder.

It is the contention of the Petitioner that in 2012, the Excise Department had conducted an

inquiry pertaining to his ownership of the liquor business to which the Petitioner had not been

able to attend. Thereafter the 1st Respondent had sought further clarifications by letter dated

29.08.13 (P22) to which the Petitioner had replied by his letter dated 04.09.13 (P23). The

Petitioner had subsequently received a letter requesting him to be present at the Excise

Department office on 01.10.13(P24). As per the contents of the said letter, it is clear that the

purpose of requesting the Petitioner to be present was to obtain a statement pertaining to the

accuracy of the documents submitted, and further he had been asked to furnish the documents

10

pertaining to his ownership. The Petitioner has replied to the said letter by his attorney-at-law

(P25, P26).

However, the Petitioner failed to address this Court, as to whether he had attended the said

inquiry or not. The Petitioners grievance is that by the letter dated 07.03.2014 (P31) the

Petitioner had been informed that his license had been suspended. The said letter states as

follows,

This Court will not venture to ascertain whether there had been fraud as claimed by the

Respondents or not, as that is a matter that has to be gone into by examining the evidence. For

the purpose of this application, the Court will see whether the procedure adopting the suspension

of the Petitioners license was done accordingly. The Petitioner challenged the procedure

adopted on many grounds. It was the contention of the Petitioner that the decision to suspend the

license is bad in law as it is;

In breach of the rules of natural justice,

The said decision is based on a purported investigation carried out by the Presidential

Investigation Unit and not by the 1st Respondent, thus the 1st Respondent had surrendered

or abdicated his duties and has acted under dictation.

The cancelation is ultravires of the provisions of section 27 of the ordinance.

As per the submissions of the Petitioner, the main contention of the Petitioner was that before the

said decision was taken, the 1st Respondent had failed to hold an inquiry and give a hearing to the

Petitioner.

11

Even though the said letter states that in addition to the findings of the Presidential Inquiry Unit,

the Excise Department too had conducted an inquiry, the Petitioner vehemently denied that there

was an independent inquiry held before his license was suspended by the 1st Respondent.

As per the submissions of the Petitioner, his main ground urging for a writ of certiorari is based

on the premise that his license has been invalidated by the 1st Respondent without holding a

proper inquiry. It appears that the whole crux of this case pertaining to the issuance of a writ of

certiorari depends on whether the 1st Respondent had independently instituted an inquiry against

the Petitioner before arriving at the decision to invalidate the license. We do not have to go

further to find the answer to this issue, as paragraph 7 of the objection filed by the 1 to 7 th

Respondents gives us the answer. The said paragraph states as follows;

Answering paragraphs 9,10,11 and 12 the Respondents admit only that Harry Manawadu

passed away in 1998. The Respondents state further that the deletion of the name of Harry

Manawadu as to make the Petitioner the exclusive license holder was secured by fraud. The

Presidential Investigations Unit having received a complaint to that effect investigated the

matter. Having considered the findings of the Presidential Investigation Unit which confirmed

the fraudulent conduct of the Petitioner, the Respondents took steps to invalidate the

Petitioners license.

(Emphasis added.)

As per the plain reading of this objection, it is clear the Respondents have taken the decision to

invalidate the license only after considering the findings of the Presidential Investigation Unit

and not after an independent inquiry held by them. Further, no material was placed before this

Court by the Respondents, pertaining to the said inquiry independent of the findings of the 7th

Respondent.

This was substantiated by the learned Counsel appearing for 1st to 7th Respondents, who

conceded that there was no independent inquiry held by the 1st Respondent under the provisions

of the Excise Ordinance before invalidating the license of the Petitioner.

Thus, it is safe to come to the conclusion, that the decision reflected in P33 has been arrived at

by the 1st Respondent, not through the procedure contemplated in the Ordinance. We can also

safely come to the conclusion that, the said decision has been arrived at not through the findings

12

of the Excise Department but by giving consideration to the findings of the Presidential

Investigation Unit. Hence both the Petitioners grounds for the urging of a writ of certiorari has

to succeed as the 1st Respondent in this instance had relied on the findings of the 7th Respondent

to come to the conclusion which resulted in P33 which is tantamount to an abdication of power

vested with the 1st Respondent.

However, this Court wishes to state that in view of the assertions made by the Respondents, this

Court has not gone into the merits of the said accusation. Thus, even though this Court holds that

invalidating of the Petitioners license cannot be sustained due to the incorrect procedure

adopted, it does not preclude the 1st Respondent if they so desire to hold a fresh inquiry to

ascertain the truth of the matter according to law and to take appropriate decisions and steps

according to law.

The next application of the Petitioner was to seek a writ of certiorari to quash document P29. As

per our brief, the document P29 is a letter where the Assistant Excise Commissioner has written

to the Divisional Secretary of Gonapinuwala whereby he has recommended extending the excise

license issued to the Petitioner, that is from 01.01.2014 to 31.03.2014. In any event, document

P29 only contains a recommendation and as it is not a final decision, nevertheless all parties

were not at variance that the said relief is now futile.

The Petitioner has also sought a writ of certiorari to quash licenses, if any, issued to the 8th

Respondent. However, there was no material submitted to this Court pertaining to the issuance of

a new license to the 8th Respondent. Also, none of the Counsels addressed this Court pertaining

to the issuance of a license to the 8th Respondent. Therefore, this Court is not inclined to grant

this relief based on a vague prayer that is uncertain, and in the absence of any decision to grant

the license to the 8th Respondent, the said relief has to fail.

Writ of Mandamus

The writ of mandamus sort in paragraph (g), is seeking a writ compelling the Respondents to

issue the license for a period of 9 months from 01.04.2014 31.12.2014. All parties were not at

variance that the said relief is now futile.

13

It is common ground that a liquor license is valid for a period of 1 year thus, it has to be extended

annually by the respective parties on submitting a fresh application with the required documents

as per the Excise Ordinance and the Regulations. Once the said application is received, the 1st

Respondent has to be satisfied with the information submitted, and thereafter if all the criteria

necessary for the granting of a license are fulfilled, a license will be issued pertaining to the duly

filled application form.

In our view, the Petitioner is attempting to overcome the said provisions by seeking a court order

to obtain the liquor license by way of a writ of mandamus. There is a clear procedure laid down

in the Excise Ordinance and the Excise Regulations, which the Petitioner should follow and after

that, if there is an unjust refusal, only the Petitioner should consider applying for a writ of

mandamus. The Petitioner has not satisfied this Court with any material to demonstrate that he

has followed the procedure laid down under the Excise Ordinance and the Regulations and

applied for a new license. This Court is also mindful that as per Regulation 13 (b), the

Commissioner General has the right to be satisfied with ownership, before the issuance of a

license and the same Regulations empower the Commissioner General to hold an inquiry in the

event of receiving a complaint for violation of the said Regulations. A writ of mandamus is a

discretionary remedy that the court grants. In the absence of any refusal or any material to

demonstrate that the Petitioner has made an application to obtain a new license fulfilling the

criteria, and in compliance with the provisions of the Excise Ordinance as well as the

Regulations, this Court is not inclined to use its discretion in favor of the Petitioner.

In P.S. Bus CO Ltd. VS Members and Secretary of Ceylon Transport Board 61 NLR 491 at

Page 495 it was held, The prerogative writs are not issued as a matter of course and it is 'in the

discretion of Court to refuse to grant it if the facts and circumstances are such as to warrant a

refusal. A writ, for instance, will not issue where it would be vexatious or futile.

In the case of Jayaweera v Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura 1996 2

SLR 70, F. N.D. Jayasuriya J observed as follows, I hold that the Petitioner who is seeking

relief in an application for the issue of a writ of certiorari is not entitled to relief was matter of

14

course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the

court has a discretion to deny him relief having regard to this conduct delay, laches, wavier,

submission to jurisdiction are all valid impediments which stand against the grant of relief.

As observed earlier in this Judgment, this Court is mindful that the license is valid only for a

period of one year, provided the Petitioner has satisfied the requirements stipulated under the

Excise Ordinance and the Regulations are fulfilled and there are no objections or any bar for the

Petitioner to obtain the said license under the provisions of the Excise Ordinance and the

regulations. The conditions that prevailed at the time of filing this application may not be present

as of now.

The learned Counsel appearing for 1st to 7th Respondents submitted during the argument, that

they were willing to consider any fresh applications if any, tendered by the Petitioner as well as

the 8th Respondent pertaining to the issuance of new license according to the law.

Thus, considering the aforesaid submissions, this Court is not inclined to grant writs of

mandamus as prayed for by the Petitioner. However, the Petitioner as well as the 8th Respondent

are free to make an application to obtain a license if they so desire according to law.

Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, we issue a writ of certiorari in terms of prayer (c, d) of

the petition.

We are not inclined to grant the other reliefs prayed for in the prayer to the petition. Subject to

the above, the Petitioners application is partly allowed. The parties to bear their own cost.
