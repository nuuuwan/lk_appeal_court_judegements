JUDGMENT

The Appellant had filed an application against the Registrar General of Companies under Section

10(1) (c) of the Companies Act No.7 of 2007. The outcome of the inquiry was that the Registrar

of Companies rejected the Appellant's application. Aggrieved by that decision, the Appellant had

invoked the jurisdiction of this Court.

The parties argued the Appeal and agreed to file fresh written submissions.

The 2nd Respondent took up an objection regarding jurisdiction. Accordingly, he argued that any

appeal from the Registrar of companies must be referred to the Commercial High Court. However,

the second Respondent did not pursue that preliminary objection. Therefore, we will not consider

the preliminary objection.

When considering the main Appeal, the Appellant argues that the name of the 2nd Respondent is

misleading and that it is similar to the name of the Appellant.

The Appellant had used the name "Jyothy Laboratories Ltd. for more than twenty years. They are

the owners of "The Ujala brand, a fabric whitener. The said company had done business in Sri

Lanka, and the Ujala brand had become a household name.

The Sri Lankan distributor of the Appellant was "Fa Impex (Pvt) Ltd., The Directors and the

shareholders of the 2nd Respondent company were the same persons as in Fa Impex (Pvt) Ltd.

Therefore, they were well aware of the brand Ujala and the Appellants companies. They were also

aware that Jyothy was the first name of the daughter of the Managing Director of the Appellant

Company. The 2nd Respondent had used Jyothy Laboratories Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. as its name. Using

this name had given the impression that the Appellants Company has a direct link with the 2nd

Respondent and is misleading.

As Section 10(1) of the Companies Act provides provision to direct any local company to change

its name, the Appellant sought the 1st Respondent to exercise its powers which the 1st Respondent

had failed to fulfil. Therefore, the Appellants plead from Court to direct the Registrar General of

Companies to duly hear and determine the application of the Appellant in terms of Section 10(1)

of the Companies Act.

When the matter was taken up for argument, the Appellant argued that Section 10(1) (c), which

reads as;

"Notwithstanding Section 7, the registrar may direct a company to change its name in the following

circumstances". Subsection (c) reads as

(c) a request is made to the Registrar to do so by any person, and the Registrar is satisfied that

the name was not applied for in good faith for the purpose of identifying the company.

Even though this provision is specified in the Act, Registrar failed to consider the application of

the Appellant and informed that there was no provision under the Companies Act to accede to the

request of the Appellant.

Section 472(2) had permitted the Appellant to appeal against the decision of the Registrar.

Section 472 reads as

Page 4 of 5

"A person who is aggrieved by an act on the decision of the Registrar may appeal to the

Court within fifteen working days after the date of receiving notice of the act or decision,

or such further time as the Court may allow".

The Appellant argued that the 1st Respondent had failed to understand his powers and duties in

exercising Section 10(1) (c). He was duty bound to hold an inquiry, and at the inquiry, the

Appellant satisfied the 1st Respondent that the name of the 2nd Respondent had applied for the

name in bad faith; he should direct the 2nd Respondent to remove the name.

The argument of the 1st Respondent was different. The argument is that the Act's objective is to

prevent confusion between an already registered company and a company being registered afresh.

According to Section 7(1)(a), the Registrar can consider only where a company is already in

existence or a registered overseas company with an identical name.

Section 529 defines a company as a "company incorporated under this act or an existing company.

An "existing company" means "a company formed and registered under the joined Stock

Companies Ordinance of 1861, or the joint Stock Banking Ordinance of 1897, the Companies

Ordinance or the Companies Act No.17 of 1982.

It is the argument of the 1st Respondent that the Appellant does not fall into any of the above

categories. He neither qualifies to be considered as a registered overseas company. It was the duty

of the Appellant to prove that he falls into the categories of a registered overseas company as per

Section 488 and Section 489 of the Act. Therefore, being a registered company in India cannot be

considered a registration in Sri Lanka. Had the Appellant satisfied that it is a registered overseas

company, the Registrar is liable and duty bound to consider, but in this instance, the Appellant had

not satisfied same.

On the other hand, the 1st Respondent had argued that the application could not be considered as

there was no proper application.

Only a natural or juristic person can apply because Sri Lankan law permits and recognizes only

those two types as a person since the Appellant is not registered under the Act and, therefore, not

Page 5 of 5

a juristic person. A juristic person can only be formed by incorporation under a statute or Act. The

Appellant had not provided material to satisfy the 1st Respondent.

The request that the 1st Respondent had denied stating that there is no provision, was by a person

holding a Power of Attorney of the Appellant. The Power of Attorney holder is also not a Sri

Lankan national. The Act has not provided provisions regarding non-Sri Lanka or juristic persons.

Section 10(1) (c) does not give any right to a none Sri Lankan to prefer a request. If so, the Act

will not expressly state registered overseas companies.

When considering this argument, even a Power of Attorney of a Sri Lankan should be registered

with the Registrar General for it to have any effect. Only after the registration, can the attorney

operate on behalf of the principal when the principal is not residing in Sri Lanka.

On the other hand, as the argument of the 1st Respondent, the Power of Attorney holder can only

act in situations where the principal has the power to act. As discussed above, the principal must

provide proof to satisfy the Registrar of Companies that he is subject to the law of this country. As

a person or as a registered overseas company where the principal cannot be accepted, the Power

of Attorney cannot be accepted.

Therefore, the reasoning given by the 1st Respondent should be accepted. The Appeal is dismissed

subject to taxed costs.
