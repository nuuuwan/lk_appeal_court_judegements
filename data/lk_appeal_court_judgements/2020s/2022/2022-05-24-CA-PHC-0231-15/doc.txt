This is an appeal filed on 30.11.2015 against the order of the High Court dated

11.11.2015 which set aside an order of the Magistrate Court dated 30.04.2015

in Case No 68984. Case No 68984 was filed in terms of Section 98 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 (hereinafter the CPC) whereby the

respondent was named as an accused for causing public nuisance. The

respondent is a subsidiary of Hayleys Group and manufactures and exports

rubber gloves. During the course of the instant application, all but one petitioner

withdrew their petitions.

On 28.02.2015 the Magistrate issued a conditional order (under Section 98 of the

CPC) detailing certain conditions to halt the operation of the factory and ordered

the factory to be closed within 14 days. During the inquiry, the Magistrate called

reports from the Central Environmental Authority and the office of the Medical

Officer of Health Hanwella. Subsequently, on 30.04.2015, the Magistrate directed

the respondent to close the factory, making the conditional order dated

28.02.2015 absolute. Aggrieved by the said determination, the respondent

preferred a revision application to the High Court. On 11.11.2015, the learned

High Court Judge set aside the Magistrate Court order and directed fresh

conditions to the respondent, allowing the factory to continue its operations in

compliance with the said conditions. Dissatisfied with such a pronouncement,

the petitioner has preferred the instant appeal to the Court of Appeal.

During the argument stage, the counsel for the petitioner submitted that he will

be canvassing a single issue of substantive law. The counsel for the petitioner

impugned the learned High Court Judges decision that the Magistrates failure

to consider the documents (which were not led as evidence during the inquiry)

amounted to an irregularity warranting the interference of the High Court acting

in revision. As such, the issue to be dealt with by this Court was framed as

follows: had the High Court erred in law in holding that the Magistrate Court had

failed to consider in his judgment a document that was not led in evidence? (Vide

CA-PHC-231-15 Page 6 of 12 24/05/2022 IJ-19-22

Page 178, Vol 1 and Page 188, Vol 1 of Appeal Brief). The counsels contention

was that the Magistrate was correct in disregarding the documents as they were

not authenticated or otherwise validated by way of evidentiary principles. In

support of this contention the counsel submitted that ours was an adversarial

system and not inquisitorial one where the Magistrate is expected to embark on

a voyage of fact finding on his own. It was contended that the Magistrate is

required to make an inquiry till the point of delivering a conditional order under

Section 98 of the CPC. It was his submission that after such a conditional order,

the burden shifts to the respondent, whereby the respondent must lead evidence

to show cause as to why the conditional order should not be made absolute.

Counsel for the petitioner further submitted that while Section 98 of the CPC

envisions a procedural mechanism by which the environmental rights of citizens

are safeguarded, it does not exclude the substantive laws of evidence and other

laws. In support of this contention, counsel for the petitioner referred to instances

where the contents of governmental reports such as Surveyors Report,

Government Analyst Report are required to be testified to carry any evidentiary

value. The counsel further contended that a mere submission of a report by a

government authority doesnt qualify such report as evidence, its authenticity

and veracity must be tested before it is accepted as evidence. Referring to excerpts

of the impugned High Court order (Vide Page 189, vol 1), the counsel for the

petitioner argued that no greater status or credibility ought to be afforded to

government authorities by virtue of its legitimacy as a state structure and that

before the eyes of justice, all entities whether private or public are equally treated.

Counsel argued that the High Court has erroneously concluded that reports, by

virtue of it being produced by a state entity, ought to be considered. He contended

that if such a construction is accepted by this Court it would open a floodgate,

necessarily endowing the Magistrate Court with the power to consider any

material presented before it by the government irrespective of its authenticity.

(Vide Page 191, vol 1). In concluding, the counsel for the petitioner contended

that the respondents cannot later come an agitate the application of the reports

without leading them as evidence in the first instance.

The Presidents Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent stated that as the

respondent company has received an Environmental Protection License (EPL) the

company cannot commit a public nuisance. The Presidents Counsel stressed on

the adverse impact of an erroneous application of Section 98 of the CPC on the

countrys development projects and reiterated the role played by the respondent

company within the community and the country at large. According to the written

submissions of the respondent, at the time of filing the instant application, the

company sourced almost 90% of all its raw material from the local market and

had at the time around 3000 local latex suppliers. Additionally, at that time the

respondent directly employed 500 employees in the factory which has in turn

indirectly created 7000 employment opportunities across its value chain. The

Presidents Counsel characterized the ground raised by the petitioner as a mere

technicality that ought to be disregarded. The Presidents Counsel referred to

Dulfa Umma v Urban District Council, Matale 40 NLR 474 in support of the

contention that a technicality as the current issue should not vitiate the entire

process before the High Court. Finally, the Presidents Counsel submitted that

there was no need to lead the reports as evidence since they were called by the

Magistrate himself and that in such a context, the contents of the report which

revealed that there was no environmental impact from the factory, was

erroneously disregarded by the Magistrate. Hence, the Presidents Counsel

submitted that the High Court order dated 30.11.2015 which set aside the

Magistrate Court order should be re-affirmed.

This Court will briefly set out the law governing public nuisance. Section 98 of

the CPC confers vast powers on a Magistrate to act with urgency when confronted

with a public nuisance. The marginal note of Section 98 of the CPC states,

Conditional order for removal of nuisance and begins by stating Whenever a

Magistrate considers on receiving a report or other information and on taking such

evidence (if any) as he thinks fit.... This section empowers the Magistrate to issue

ex parte conditional orders in specific instances. Hence, Section 98(1) details the

instances under which such a conditional order can be delivered and the actions

CA-PHC-231-15 Page 8 of 12 24/05/2022 IJ-19-22

that the Magistrate it entitled order thereunder. As such Section 98(1) ends with

the following:

...such Magistrate may make a conditional order requiring that the person causing such obstruction or nuisance or carrying on such trade or occupation or keeping any such goods or merchandise or owning, possessing, or controlling such building, substance, tree, tank, well or excavation shall within a time to be fixed by such order

(i) remove such obstruction or nuisance; or (ii) suppress or remove such trade or occupation; or (iii) remove such goods or merchandise; or (iv) prevent or stop the construction of such building; or (v) remove, repair, or support it; or (vi) alter the disposal of such substance; or (vii) remove such tree; or (viii) fence such tank, well. or excavation as the case maybe.

A plain reading of Section 98(1) of the CPC reveals that the Magistrate has very

wide powers under the section to issue a conditional order. These powers are in

consideration of a sense of urgency in that the legislature has provided for the

Magistrate to expediently intervene in instances where a public nuisance can

cause irreparable danger. This is evident from the fact that the Magistrate is

allowed to take drastic measures and make orders even in the absence of the

faulty party. The threshold to issue such conditional order is Whenever a

Magistrate considers on receiving a report or other information and on

taking such evidence (if any) as he thinks fit... (Section 98(1)). The words are

very wide enabling the Magistrate to act expediently to safeguard public interest.

When such wide powers are vested, a Magistrate should exercise such powers

sparingly, after careful consideration of all material relevant.

When considering Indian authorities (though the Sections are not identical to Sri

Lankan context), the counterpart to Section 98(1) of the CPC is contained in

Section 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure India. Indian authorities

commenting on the Section observes that proof of imminent danger or urgency is

necessary for the Magistrate to exercise the wide-ranging powers vested on him

to deal with public nuisance: there must be imminent danger to the health or the

CA-PHC-231-15 Page 9 of 12 24/05/2022 IJ-19-22

physical comfort of the community in the locality in which the trade or occupation

is conducted. The danger should be such that if the Magistrate does not take

immediate action and directs the public to take ordinary course of law, irreparable

damage would ensue (Principles of Commentary on the Code of Criminal

Procedure, 1973 19th Edition, Delhi Law House, Page 968). Sohoni commenting

on Section 133 of the Indian code observed the following:

the magistrate, while dealing with an application under Section 133

Cr. P. C would first issue a conditional order in Form No 20 of the

code calling upon the respondent to remove the nuisance. If the

respondent objects to do so on his appearance, he should be asked

to show cause for the order being made absolute. Thereafter, the

Magistrate has to take evidence in the matter as in a summons case,

and only thereafter the Magistrate if he is satisfied, will make the

order absolute.

There is no statutory provision in India justifying a private person or

member of the public in demolishing a building etc., by way of

abating a nuisance. The scheme of Section 133 to 141 indicates that

in the case of such a public nuisance, anybody aggrieved by it should

not take the law into his own hand but must resort to the particular

procedure laid down therein. Section 133 of the Code provides a

speedy and summary remedy in case of urgency where danger to

public interest or public health is concerned. In all other cases the

party should be referred to the remedy under the ordinary law or

annoyance must be caused. Any person naturally can give a

Magistrate information of the existence of any state of affairs, and

when the Magistrate acts on that information he is acting suo motu.

(Sohonis The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 18th Edition

Volume 2 (1985) at Page 953)

CA-PHC-231-15 Page 10 of 12 24/05/2022 IJ-19-22

When examining Section 98(2) of the CPC, it provides for the following:

Any person against whom a conditional order has been made under

subsection (1) may appear before the Magistrate making that order

or any other Magistrate of that court before the expiration of the time

fixed by that order and move to have the order set aside or modified

in manner hereinafter provided

As such, it is clear that after an ex parte conditional order is issued by the

Magistrate under Section 98(1) of the CPC, the person to whom the order is

addressed it given an opportunity to show cause (Section 100 of the CPC). If the

person appears and moves the conditional order to be set aside or modified, the

legislature provides that the Magistrate shall take evidence in the said matter

and, depending on his satisfaction, either rescind or modify the impugned order

or make the order absolute (Section 101 of the CPC). Under Section 101 of the

CPC the Magistrate is allowed to either make the previous conditional order

absolute or rescind or amended the previous conditional order. In the latter case,

the amended conditional order will be made absolute. If the Magistrate, after

evaluating the material presented by the person to whom the conditional order is

addressed, is satisfied that the conditional order he previously made was not

reasonable and proper, the Magistrate will not make the same absolute. (Section

101 of the CP). As held in Kularatne v Dharnadasa (2001) ACJ 28 CA, when a

Magistrate makes a conditional order in terms of Section 98, it is the party who

moves to have the conditional order set aside or modified that has to begin and

adduce evidence to show that the order is not reasonable and proper. The overall

burden of establishing a public nuisance lies on the complainant. Speaking on

Section 101(1) of the CPC, Greena Fernando v Teckla Saparamadu (1990) 1

SLR 270 held that Section 101(1) lays down the procedure to be followed when

such party appears in Court and moves to have the order set aside or modified.

This section makes it mandatory for the Magistrate to take evidence in the matter.

A judicial investigation must be held and after it, if the court thinks that the

conditional order is not reasonable and proper in view of the circumstances of the

CA-PHC-231-15 Page 11 of 12 24/05/2022 IJ-19-22

case, it will either rescind it entirely or modify its terms so as to bring it into

conformity with the requirements of the case.

From the above examination, it is clear that the Magistrate acting under Section

98 of the CPC has unique and wide powers. In exercising such power, the specific

facts and circumstances should be considered by the Magistrate on a case-by-

case basis. As the Magistrate is vested with a wide range of powers under Section

98 of the CPC with far reaching impact, the exercise of that power must be

reasonable and proper. This is most important as the Magistrate will be acting in

the public interest, whereby the interest of all parties must be considered and

balanced accordingly. The judges of the courts of first instance may be called

upon to make decisions that have implications on the social and economic policy

of the country. In such a context, weighing and balancing individual rights

against the requirements of the rest of the society must take center stage. Hence,

it is the duty of the presiding judge to consider all available material prior to

arriving at a decision that effectuate far-reaching implications. In the context of

public nuisance, whereby a judge is endowed with drastic powers, court should

exercise its power to issue conditional (or absolute) orders in a judicious manner

at the most appropriate case of absolute necessity. Such an order must be issued

under caution whereby the possible hardships and repercussions on the parties

involved must be considered.

The conditional order delivered by the Magistrate on 28.02.2015 directed the

closure of the respondent factory. When such a direction has been made, one

must carefully evaluate all relevant and available material pertaining to the

alleged public nuisance. The reports commissioned by the Magistrate would

inevitably give insight into the operations of the factory and the allegations

levelled against it. As displayed by the previous analysis, the role of the

Magistrate is to take evidence and conduct a judicial investigation. Even at the

point of making the conditional order absolute, the Magistrate failed to take

congnisance of the commissioned reports, which in the considered opinion of this

Court amounts to an irregularity that warrants intervention. As such, this Court

agrees with the decision of the High Court dated 11.11.2015, whereby the learned

CA-PHC-231-15 Page 12 of 12 24/05/2022 IJ-19-22

High Court Judge allowed the respondent to operate the factory while imposing

fresh conditions to be followed by the respondent. The High Court has correctly

held that the commissioned reports ought to have been considered by the

Magistrate.

Hence, I see no reason to interfere with the learned High Court Judges order

dated 11.11.2015.

Appeal dismissed.
