Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner being a National Volleyball player has held several positions relating to the

functions of the Sri Lanka Volleyball Federation including the post of National Volleyball

Coach.

The Petitioner has toured Japan in 1995 with the Sri Lanka Mens National Volleyball

team as a coach and evaded returning to Sri Lanka. As a result of such conduct, the Sri

Lanka Volleyball Federation (Federation) has suspended the Petitioner from taking part

and/or getting involved in any activities of the Federation.

In 1999, upon the arrival to Sri Lanka, the Petitioner has made an appeal to the Federation

against the said decision of suspension. Consequently, the Federation has taken a decision

to remove the Petitioners suspension with effect from 31.03.2004 (Vide-P2) and

thereafter, he continued to serve as a coach under the Federation for few years.

In the meantime, the Minster of Sports has published the Gazette Extraordinary

Notification No. 1990/23 dated 27.10.2016 (P8). The clause 4(s) of Part II of the said

Gazette Notification reads;

Page 3 of 6

A person shall be disqualified from being elected or otherwise to hold or continue

to hold any paid or unpaid office or to hold any paid or unpaid post or to be a

member of a Committee of any National Association of Sports or to be nominee of

an affiliated club or organization in a National Association of Sports, if:-

(s) he being a person who represented the country in an international sports

event with the approval or concurrence of the Minister of Sports for an

activity related to sports and had not returned to Sri Lanka;

The contention of the Petitioner is that the disqualification set out in the Gazette

Notification P8 has no bearing on the Petitioner as those regulations were published after

he returned from Japan. Anyhow, the Federation referring to the desertion of the team

during the tour to Japan, informed the Petitioner by letter dated 25.04.2017, marked P10,

that the Petitioner had acted in contrary to clause 4(s) of Part II of the P8 and thereby he

would not be entitled to apply to the post of a coach of any National team with effect from

25.04.2017.

Subsequently, upon such decision of the Federation, the Petitioner made an appeal to the

Minster of Sports by way of letter dated 07.01.2021, marked P11. The Appeal made by

the Petitioner has been rejected on the basis that the Appeal Committee was not

empowered to examine the same in terms of the Sports Regulations as it had been lodged

against a decision taken almost 4 years ago. The rejection of the Appeal has been

communicated to the Petitioner by the impugned letter dated 08.02.2021 and letter dated

15.03.2021, marked P12 & P13 respectively.

The Petitioner claims that the said letters marked P12 and P13 are ultra vires, arbitrary

and violative of his legitimate expectation of fair and transparent hearing and he seeks,

inter alia, for a writ of Certiorari to quash the decisions reflected in P12 and P13.

The Respondents raised the following two preliminary objections when the instant

application was taken up in this Court for support;

i. Petitioner is guilty of laches

ii. necessary parties are not before Court as the Federation has not been made a party

I must draw my attention now to the relevant law in regard to appeals made by aggrieved

parties of sports bodies. The Section 30 of Sports Law No. 25 of 1973;

Page 4 of 6

Any person who is aggrieved by any decision or action of a registered National

Association of Sports may, in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this

Law, appeal to the Minister against such decision or action and the Ministers

decision on such appeal shall be final and conclusive and shall not be questioned

in any court of law.

The Clause 8(1) of Part IV of the Regulations, marked P8, deals with the procedure in

appealing against decisions or actions of a National Association of Sports. The Clause

8(1):

Any person who is aggrieved by any decision or action of a registered National

Association of Sports may, appeal to the Minister within two weeks from the date

of communication of such decision or action. (Emphasis added).

On perusal of the documents tendered to Court, it implies that the Petitioner has submitted

an Appeal against the decision reflected in P10 almost after four years. The decision upon

which the Petitioner submitted an appeal was given in year 2017. This clearly shows that

the Petitioner has lodged an appeal out of time. Moreover, as pointed out by the

Respondents, the Petitioner has failed to make the Federation a party in the instant

Application. The established law relating to judicial review requires that those who would

be affected by the outcome of the writ application should be made Respondents. The

general rule is that when the decision given by the Appellate body is being challenged, the

parties to the original dispute should be made Respondents. In the circumstances, I am of

the view that the there is no merit in the arguments of the Petitioner raised in the instant

Application.

For completeness, I must advert to the assertions of the Petitioner that the Clause 4(s) of

the Regulations has no bearing on the Petitioner. The Regulations, marked P8, under

Sports Law has been published in the year 2016. The argument of the Petitioner is that he

has already been punished for not returning from Japan and it was based on an incident

before 2016; and thus, the Clause 4(s) of P8 is not applicable to him. I am unable to

accept such assertions as the Federation has imposed a punishment previously against the

Petitioner after identifying a misconduct identical to the misconduct or offence recognized

in the said Clause 4(s). It is admitted that the Petitioner has undergone a punishment as

Page 5 of 6

mentioned earlier for his misconduct of deserting the National Team and not returning to

Sri Lanka after the Tour, although such punishment has been relaxed later on. This reflects

that the said misconduct of the Petitioner has become a purported offence not only by

operation of Clause 4(s) but even in the year 1995 (during the tour to Japan) such conduct

was in the nature of an offence.

Hence, it cannot be assumed that the effect of such Clause 4(s) tends to disregard an

identical misconduct or an offence (described in the said clause) upon which a punishment

has been imposed before 2016 (probably in the year 1998). I am mindful of the principles

relating to retrospective effect upon laws. When interpreting the Clause 4(s), I take the

view that the respective misconduct, which has been identified even before 2016 as a

misconduct or an offence committed at that time, cannot be possibly overlooked for the

purpose of Clause 4(s) and it will not affect the principles on retrospective laws.

The other argument advanced by the Petitioner that the said Clause 4(s) is applicable only

to the members of the Sports Association, also cannot be accepted as there is no adequate

material submitted by the Petitioner to establish, prima facie, that he was not holding any

paid or unpaid office, a category which clearly comes within the purview of the above

Clause 4. By plain reading of the said Clause, it clearly envisages that a post of coach

comes within the definition of paid or unpaid office/post.

Additionally, the Petitioner contends that the Ministers approval was not a necessity for

him to tour Japan in 1995 and thereby, the Regulations discussed above are not applicable

to him. The purported basis for such argument is that although the words approval or the

concurrence of the Minister is embodied in said Clause 4(s), the Petitioners tour to Japan

has been approved not by the Minister but by the North Western Provincial Council. I am

not inclined to examine such assertions as the Petitioner admittedly underwent the

punishment imposed in reference to the Japan tour and such decision for punishment had

not been challenged in a court of law. The concession provided subsequently by the

Federation in respect of the said punishment would not negate this position. Anyhow, the

Petitioner has categorically submitted in the instant application that he is challenging only

the decisions reflected in P12 and P13.

In passing, I comment that there cannot be any compromise on any act or misconduct

which brings disrepute to the motherland when you represent the country as a team or as

Page 6 of 6

an individual in a foreign nation. Discipline in every aspect is the foundation for any sport

as the level of success is mostly determined by your level of discipline.

In the circumstances and based on the above reasons, I am compelled to reject the

contention of the Petitioner that the impugned orders are ultra vires and illegal. Therefore,

this Court takes the view that the Petitioner has not submitted a prima facie case on an

arguable question which warrants this Court to issue formal notice on the Respondents.

Application is refused.
