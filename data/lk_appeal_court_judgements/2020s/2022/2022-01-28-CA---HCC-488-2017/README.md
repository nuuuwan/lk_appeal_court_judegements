JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam J

This appeal is preferred by the Hon.Attorney General.

The above-named Accused-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) was indicted under Sections 54(A) (d) and 54(A) (b) of the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13

of 1984 for Possession and Trafficking respectively of less than one gram of

Heroin on 02nd May 2011 in the High Court of Colombo.

Before the trial commenced, on 31/01/2017 the Respondent had pleaded

guilty to both charges in the indictment. After the submissions by both

parties, the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo has imposed the following

sentence.

For the 1st count a fine of Rs.15,000/- with a default sentence of 6 months

simple imprisonment and 12 months rigorous imprisonment suspended for

07 years.

For the 2nd count a fine of Rs.15,000/- with a default sentence of 6 months

simple imprisonment and 12 months rigorous imprisonment suspended for

07 years.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid sentence the Appellant preferred this appeal

to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Respondent informed this court that the

respondent has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the

Covid 19 pandemic.

3 | P a g e

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. That the imposed sentence is manifestly erroneous for it is contrary to

sections 54[A] (b) and 54[A](d) of the Poison, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No.13 of 1984.

2. That the sentence is manifestly inadequate having regard to the nature

of the offences for which the Respondent had been convicted and the

antecedents of repeated convictions for similar offences.

3. That the antecedents of the Respondent warrant an order for

compulsory rehabilitation.

Background of the case.

The Respondent was arrested during a raid conducted by a group of police

officers from Welikada Police Station, around 4.25pm on 02/05/2011 in

front of the Buddha Statue, in Maligawa Road, Ethul Kotte. At that time, he

was found to be in possession of 2.22 grams of substance which the officers

believed to be Heroin, in a bag hidden in his trouser pocket. He was then

arrested and the substance recovered from the Respondent was sent to the

Government Analyst under a court order. As per the Government Analysts

Report the substance contained 9 milligrams of Diacetyl Morphine commonly

known as Heroin. As the Respondent had previous convictions, an

indictment was preferred against him in the High Court of Colombo.

On 31/01/2017 when this case was called in the Colombo High Court the

Respondent had pleaded guilty to both charges levelled against him in the

indictment.

The Learned High Court Judge has convicted the Respondent upon his own

plea and imposed the above-mentioned sentence.

As the 1st and 2nd grounds are based on the sentence, both appeal grounds

will be considered together. The Appellant contends that the imposed

4 | P a g e

sentence is manifestly erroneous for it is contrary to sections 54[A] (b) and

54[A](d) of the Poison and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act

No.13 of 1984 and that the sentence is manifestly inadequate having regard

to the nature of the offences for which the Respondent had been convicted

and the antecedents of repeated convictions for similar offences.

According to Section 54[A] (b) and (d) if any person traffic or possess less

than one gramme of Heroin the prescribed sentence is a fine not less than

fifteen thousand rupees and not exceeding fifty thousand rupees and or

imprisonment of either description for a period not less than three years and

not exceeding seven years.

Under this section minimum fine and minimum imprisonment has been

prescribed by the law.

Upon perusal of the High Court proceedings the prosecution has brought to

the notice of the court the previous convictions of the Respondent with case

numbers, date of arrest and the sentences imposed on him. Further the

offence relating to the instant appeal has been committed during the

operational period of the suspended sentence.

In The Attorney General v H.N.de Silva 57 NLR 121 Basnayake A.C.J (as

he then was) stated as follows:

In assessing the punishment that should be passed on an offender a

judge should consider the matter of sentence both from the point of view

of the public and the offender. Judges are too often prone to look at the

question only from the angle of the offender. A judge should, in

determining the proper sentence should first consider the gravity of the

offence as it appears from the nature of the act itself, and should have

regard to the punishment provided in the Penal Code, or other Statute,

under which the offender is charged. He should also regard the effect of

the punishment as a deterrent and consider to what extent it will be

effectiveThe incidence of crimes of the nature of which the offender

5 | P a g e

has been found to be guilty. The difficulty of detection are also matters

which should receive due consideration. The reformation of the criminal,

though no doubt an important consideration, is subordinate to the others

I have mentioned. Where the public interest or welfare of the State

(which are synonymous) outweighs the previous good character,

antecedents and age of the offender, public interest must prevail.

In The Attorney General v Jinak Sri Uluwaduge and Another 1995 (1)

SLR 157 the court held:

We are in agreement with the observations made by Basnayake A.C.J.

in the case of Attorney General v H.N. de Silva (1) that whilst the

reformation of the criminal though no doubt is an important consideration

in assessing the punishment that should be passed on the offender

where the public interest or the welfare of the State outweighs the

previous good character, antecedents and age of the offender that public

interest must prevail Having regard to the serious nature and the

manner in which these offences have been committed by the Accused-

Respondents we are of the view that the sentence imposed in this case

is grossly inadequate.

In The Attorney General v J. Mendis C.A. 430/92 C.A. Minutes of

15.12.1995 SLR 138 the court held:

In our view once an accused is found guilty and convicted on his own

plea or after trial, the Trial Judge has a difficult function to perform. That

is to decide what sentence is to be imposed on the accused who has been

convicted. In doing so he has to consider the point of view of the accused

on the one hand and the interests of the society on the other. In deciding

what sentence is to be imposed the judge must necessarily consider the

nature of the offence committed. The gravity of the offence, the manner

6 | P a g e

in which it has been committed, the machinations and the manipulations

resorted to by the accused to commit the offence, the effect of committing

such a crime, insofar as the institution or organisation in respect of which

it has been committed, the persons who are affected by such crime, the

ingenuity in which it has been committed and the involvement of others

in committing the crime.

The Learned Counsel for the Respondent citing SC/Appeal/No.89A/2009

decided on 12/05/2011 and SC Reference No.03/2008 decided on

15/10/2008 and SC/Appeal/No.17/2013 decided on 12/03/2015 argued

that the High Court is not inhibited from imposing an appropriate sentence

notwithstanding a minimum mandatory sentence being given.

What is an appropriate sentence varies according to the facts of each case

and should be determined by considering the entire evidence presented by

the prosecution and the defence.

In this case the prosecution has provided the previous case history of the

Appellant to court before the sentence was passed. All previous convictions

were pertaining to the possession of Heroin although of different quantities.

Further the sentence in this case was passed during the operational period

of a suspended sentence.

Considering all the circumstances and the gravity of the offence committed

by the Respondent in this case, I conclude that this is not an appropriate

case to disregard the imposition of a minimum mandatory sentence so as to

impose a suspended sentence using judicial discretion.

Hence, we set aside the sentence imposed by the Learned High Court Judge

of Colombo on 31/01/2017 and substitute the sentence as follows:

1. For count one Rs.15000/- fine with default sentence of 06 months

simple imprisonment and three years rigorous imprisonment.

2. For count two Rs.15000/- fine with default sentence of 06 months

simple imprisonment and three years rigorous imprisonment.

7 | P a g e

We further order that the three years rigorous imprisonment imposed on

count one and count two to run concurrently.

As no order has been made in respect of third ground of appeal by the High

Court this Court also make no order.

Accordingly, we allow the appeal and vary the sentence imposed by the

Learned High Court Judge of Colombo on 31/01/2017. The substituted

sentence shall commence from the day the High Court communicate the

judgment of this court to the Respondent.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court

of Colombo along with the original case record.
