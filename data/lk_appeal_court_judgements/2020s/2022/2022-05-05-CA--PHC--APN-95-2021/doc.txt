Decided on: 05.05.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to set aside the order

dated 30/07/2021 of High Court of Panadura.

In the instant matter, the second suspect respondent namely

Arumapurage Ranuja Salitha Ranathissa had been taken into custody

for being in possession of a gross quantity of Heroin of 25.76 grams. He

had been in remand ever since. The Government Analyst report has

been received in the year 2020 and the pure quantity has been

identified to be as 9.426 grams. The Counsel for the suspect submitted

that he had no previous convictions or any pending cases.

The Counsel for the Attorney General stated that indictment has been

filed against the suspect on 01/04/2022 and a copy of the same was

handed over to Court. The Counsel for the Attorney General draws the

attention of Court to the fact that the suspect has been charged for

offences under the Money Laundering Act in addition to charges under

the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act.

The Counsel for the Attorney General objected for bail being granted.

According to the provisions of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Act, a person arrested or indicted under this Act, he or she can be

enlarged on bail only upon exceptional circumstances. The term

exceptional has not been defined in the Act but in view of the decided

Page 5 of 5

cases, the gravity of the offence , the gravity of the sentence and the

culpability of the accused have been considered to be exceptional.

This has been discussed in the case of Carder v OIC Narcotic Bureau

2006 3 SLR 74, by Basnayaka J.

In the instant matter the Counsel for the suspect has not pleaded any

exceptional ground, as such, this Court sees no reason to set aside the

Order of the High Court. Therefore, the instant application for revision

is hereby dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
