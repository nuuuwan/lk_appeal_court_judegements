Judgment

This appeal emanates from the Order made by the learned High Court Judge of Ratnapura

dismissing the revision application of the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant made against the Order

of the learned Magistrate of Ratnapura dated 28.01.2014.

It appears that the Provincial High Court of Ratnapura by Order dated 20.09.2017 dismissed the

application of the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant for want of jurisdiction on the basis that the

Provincial High Court has no jurisdiction to review matters pertaining to State lands.

The Respondent has relied upon the Supreme Court Judgment in the Case of The Superintendent,

Stafford Estate and Others Vs. Solaimuthu Rasu [(2013) 1 S.L.R 25], which held that the

Provincial High Court has no jurisdiction over the matters related to State lands, as powers relating

to State lands have not been devolved to the Provincial Councils by the 13th Amendment to the

Constitution. It is seen that the aforesaid case was a matter related to the writ jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court over a decision on a State land.

It is seen that, the learned Judge of the High Court of Sabaragamuwa Province (holden in

Ratnapura) had obviously followed the Judgment of The Superitendent, Stafford Estate & Two

others Vs. Solaimuthu Rasu [supra], which is a writ application. However, as many Judgments

and authorities have held, the High Court acting under Article 138 of the Constitution, has

jurisdiction to try and hear revision applications relating to State lands.

It is relevant to note that the ratio decidendi of the Judgment in Solaimuthu Rasus case, which

held that the Provincial High Court, had no jurisdiction to issue writs under Article 154P (4) of the

Constitution pertaining to State lands.

In order for the Provincial High Courts to exercise writ jurisdiction, the issue should be one that

falls within the purview of the Provincial Council list. Since the subject-State lands does not fall

within the purview of the Provincial Council list, Provincial High Court is not empowered to issue

writs under Article 154P (4) of the Constitution in respect of matters pertaining to State lands.

According to Article 154P (3) (b) of the Constitution, which stipulates that, Every such High

Court shall notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any Law, exercise appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction in respect of convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by

Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within the province.

It is noteworthy that revisionary jurisdiction in terms of Article 154P (3) (b) of the Constitution,

has not excluded the power to exercise appellate or revisionary jurisdiction regarding State lands.

It is observable that the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant had invoked the revisionary jurisdiction

of the Provincial High Court of Ratnapura in terms of Article 154P (3) (b), and not under Article

154P (4) of the Constitution.

Therefore, it appears that the learned High Court Judge has misconstrued the Articles of the

Constitution and also relied on the Judgment of Solaimuthu Rasu expressing his view that any

matter relating to State lands could not be reviewed in any manner in the Provincial High Court.

As such, it is apparent that the Order made by the learned High Court Judge dismissing the revision

application made by the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant is made per incuriam. Therefore, the

impugned Order dated 20.09.2017 made by the learned High Court Judge is set aside.

We take notice of the motion dated 17.05.2022 filed on behalf of the Applicant-Respondent-

Respondent, stating that there is no objection to setting aside the impugned Order of the learned

High Court Judge of Ratnapura dated 20.09.2017 and sending this case back to the Provincial High

Court of Ratnapura to re-hear and determine this matter on its merits.

Thus, the appeal is allowed and Registrar is directed to send the case record back to the High Court

of Ratnapura forthwith.

I agree.
