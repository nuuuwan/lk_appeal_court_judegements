Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner in this application seeks, inter alia, for a mandate in the nature of a writ of

Certiorari to quash the decision of the Selection Committee and the University Council of

the Eastern University of Sri Lanka, reflected in document marked P53, to appoint the

Page 4 of 7

30th Respondent for the post of Lecturer (Probationary) in Islamic Studies. The 2nd to 5th,

8th to 12th & 24th to 27th Respondents (Respondents) resisting the issuance of formal notice

on the Respondents raised several preliminary objections and moved that the application

of the Petitioner be dismissed in limine.

The Registrar of the Eastern University of Sri Lanka (University) called for applications

by way of a notice dated 16.11.2018 (marked as P46) for the posts of;

i. Senior Lecturer Gr. I

ii. Senior Lecturer Gr. II

iii. Lecturer (Unconfirmed)

iv. Lecturer (Probationary)

A six-member Selection Committee (1st to 6th Respondents) comprising of the Vice

Chancellor and Dean (Faculty of Arts and Culture) of the University were appointed in

accordance with the Circular No. 166 dated 06.04.1982 of the University Grants

Commission (UGC) to evaluate the candidates.

The interviews were held on 23.12.2020 in respect of the posts of Senior Lecturer Gr. II,

Lecturer (Unconfirmed) and Lecturer (Probationary). As per the document marked R1,

five candidates have applied for the post of Senior Lecturer Gr. II and out of which two

applicants have not been called for interviews probably based on the reasons given in the

same document R1. The document marked R2 is the schedule of the applicants who

faced the interviews in respect of the post of Senior Lecturer Gr. II. The Petitioner is also

among those candidates who faced the interview on 23.12.2020. The summary of marks

obtained by the Petitioner after the said interview is R6 and the individual evaluation of

the Petitioner by each member of the Selection Committee are marked as R7(a) to R7(f).

In view of R1, five candidates have applied for the post of Lecturer (Probationary) and

out of them only four candidates were eligible to face the interview. However, except for

the 30th Respondent, the other candidates were not present at the interview.

The said Selection Committee had not recommended any applicant to be appointed as

Senior Lecturer Gr. II on the basis that none of the relevant applicants were able to obtain

the minimum marks, i.e., 60 which is required to be considered for appointments.

However, by virtue of the document marked R10, the said Selection Committee

recommended the 30th Respondent to be appointed to the post of Lecturer (Probationary)

Page 5 of 7

in Islamic Studies. It is observed that although, the 30th Respondent is the only candidate

who faced the interview, he had obtained the minimum marks that is required to be

considered for the relevant appointment.

The Petitioners main contention is twofold. Primarily, the Petitioner claims that the

Respondents have no authority to include a minimum mark. The argument of the

Respondents is that Section 3 of the UGC Establishment Circular Letter No. 5/2018 dated

02.04.2018 (marked as R14) requires adopting a suitable marking scheme approved by

the governing authority for the recruitment for all posts in the university system prior to

interviews. Accordingly, the Respondents assert that the University Council is vested with

the authority to decide the minimum marks required to be obtained to be selected for a

respective post.

The Respondents have tendered to Court the marking scheme for the post of Senior

Lecturer Gr. I/II, marked as R4, which was approved by the University Council at its

298th meeting held on 25.05.2019. It is observed that the said marking scheme has been

approved by the said Council before the date of the interview, i.e., 23.12.2020. It is obvious

that it would be unreasonable if the Selection Committee decides the cut off marks or the

minimum marks after evaluating the candidates. However, on perusal of the said marking

scheme R4, it appears that the minimum marks have been predetermined by the

University Council before the evaluation of the candidates. Furthermore, the incumbent

Vice Chancellor has affirmed in his Affidavit dated 24.03.2022 (submitted along with the

limited statement of objections) that the entire process of selection was carried out giving

due regard to the provisions of the UGC Circular No. 996 dated 09.10.2012, marked as

R15.

In the circumstances, I am unable to accept the proposition of the Petitioner with regard

to the minimum marks.

The other contention of the Petitioner is that two other candidates have also been

evaluated together with the Petitioner when Petitioner was the only candidate in Senior

Lecturer Gr. II and such act of the Respondents is procedurally improper, unreasonable

and ultra vires. Now I advert to examine such assertions of the Petitioner.

In view of the schedule of applications to the posts advertised, marked R1, the following

candidates specifically applied for the post of Senior Lecturer Gr. II;

Page 6 of 7

i. Dr. S. A. C. Mohamed Anasdeen

ii. Dr. M. A. Azhar

iii. Dr. L. M. Muhfeeth

iv. Mr. K Fahrudeen Mohamed

v. Mr. M. M. Nayeem

Thus, the Petitioner cannot be considered as the only candidate who applied for the post

of Senior Lecturer Gr. II. The above fourth (-iv) and fifth (-v) candidates have been

recognized as not eligible under the remarks; (a)degree is not relevant and (b) Yemenya

University Yemen and Al-Eman University are not recognized respectively. Therefore,

it appears that except for the above two candidates, others have been evaluated at the

interview although, there was a remark against the name of the above second (ii) and third

(iii) candidates that they were eligible for the post of lecturer (unconfirmed) in Islamic

Studies.

In the selection process of this case, the schedule of applicants, R1, has been prepared by

the Senior Assistant Registrar/Academic Establishments (for Registrar) and however, the

final decision on the eligibility has been taken by the Selection Committee. In my view,

when there is an approved marking scheme as in this case, the relevant authority such as

the said Registrar/Senior Assistant Registrar is authorized to disregard the applicants who

are not possessed with the basic qualifications. That is the threshold stage of an interview

process and not summoning the candidates who do not possess the basic qualifications

that are mentioned in the advertisement upon which the applications were called for, by

an authorized officer, cannot be considered unlawful. Therefore, what appears to me is

that the above second (-ii) & third (-iii) candidates were possessed with the basic

qualifications and they have been evaluated together with the Petitioner merely because

they also had applied for the same post i.e., Senior Lecturer Gr. II. The documents marked

R6, R7(a) to R7(f) and R9 evinced that the Selection Board has evaluated the candidates

who applied for the post of Senior Lecturer Gr. II and the applicants (only one was present)

for the post of Lecturer (Probationary) separately.

I am of the view that no prejudice has been caused to the Petitioner since the Respondents

have followed the due process and also due to the fact that none of the candidates in the

category of Senior Lecturer Gr. II were successful in obtaining the required minimum

marks. Hence, I cannot accept the allegation of the Petitioner that the Respondents have

Page 7 of 7

evaluated the lecturer (Probationary) separately and the rest together despite all being

different posts.

The Petitioner alleges that him being a Senior Lecturer candidate with a PhD qualification

should have been prioritized in the appointment process and accordingly, he ought to have

been appointed to the post of Lecturer (Probationary). At this stage, I draw my attention

to the advertisement marked P46 which categorically emphasizes that the candidates

who apply for more than one post should submit separate applications along with separate

bank slip in separate cover for each post. It is not disputed that the Petitioner has never

submitted a separate application as per the notice marked P46, to the post of Lecturer

(Probationary). The significant difference that should be identified here is that the

Respondents have evaluated the candidates separately based on the posts that they have

applied for and not on the basis of the remarks made by the Registrar/Senior Assistant

Registrar in R1 by using, among other, the word eligible. In view of the above, I am

compelled to accept the argument of the Respondents that the Petitioner and the 30th

Respondent applied for two distinctive posts and the Petitioner does not submit any

ground whatsoever to challenge the decision making process in respect of the appointment

of the 30th Respondent to the post of Lecturer (Probationary).

In the circumstances, I take the view that there is no prima facie question to be examined

at a full hearing in this case. Anyhow, for the reasons set out above, the Petitioners all

other alleged claims particularly the assertions that he was not treated equally and also the

claim on legitimate expectation have failed. In view of my above findings there is no

necessity to examine separately the preliminary objections raised by the Respondents.

Hence, I am of the view that there is no merit in this application and I proceed to refuse

issuing formal notice on the Respondents. Application is refused.
