As per the provisions of section 29, itis this confirmed decision when received, the Minister would give his approval and publish itin the government gazette or the Minster would refer it back to the Wages Board forreconsideration. When one looks at the wording of sections 28 and 29 of the Wages BoardOrdinance, it is clear that the decision is made by the Wages Board, and not by the Minister.The plain reading of section 28 is clear, the word used is the proposed decision of the WagesBoard until the objections are called and deliberated by the Board.

Hence, its clear that the agitation for the minimum wage hike of Rs.1000 wasa continuous contention of workers long before the presidential elections were held. Itappears that there had been several discussions between the employers and the employees onthis demand for a wage hike and in the absence of an agreement, a wages board had beenappointed to consider the employees demands. As there had been no agreement even by theWages Board as required by statute, the proposal to increase the minimum wage had been putto vote. The proposed decision taken subsequent to a vote becomes the majority decision ofthe Board. Hence the Petitioners contention that in view of P5 and P6, the Minister wasacting on a preordained path to increase the minimum wages to Rs 1000 has to fail. As perthe documents available, what is demonstrated is that, the workers agitations have beenpicked up by the contesting candidates who had endorsed the said demands.

In any event, when the facts are in dispute, a writ Court will be hesitant toexercise its jurisdiction. In Thajudeen Vs Sri Lanka Tea Board and another (1981) 2 SLR471 it was held Where the major facts are in dispute and the legal result of the facts issubject to controversy and it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in a suitwhere parties would have ample opportunity of examining the witnesses so that the Courtwould be better able to judge which version is correct, a writ will not issue. It should also be noted that the statute is silent on the time period that should be given totender objections. In my view, a sufficient time period should be given for objections. ThePetitioners have submitted the minutes of the said Wages Board meeting to this Court markedas CA5. The said minutes demonstrate that the 2nd Respondent has answered the objectionpertaining to the time period given for objections. Further, it also demonstrates deliberationspertaining to the objections raised. Thus, the Wages Board had deliberated the objectionswhere the employers representatives have been heard. In view of the above, I am unable toagree with the Petitioners submission that they have not been heard properly in consideringthe objections submitted.",
