After the trial, the Appellant was found guilty for all the counts and the

Learned Judge of the High Court of Colombo has imposed the following

sentences on the Appellant by his judgment dated 29/08/2018:

1. For every count a fine of Rs.5,000/- with a default sentence of 3

months simple imprisonment.

2. For every count 4 months rigorous imprisonment (a total of 16

months rigorous imprisonment) imposed and the same was

suspended for 7 years.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. At the hearing, the Appellant was waiting outside the court due

to Covid 19 restrictions.

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal were raised.

1. The Learned Trial Judge has not taken in to consideration matters

favourable to the Accused- Appellant and therefore has there been a

miscarriage of justice?

2. The Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself in applying the law

relating to the defence of alibi?

3. Has the Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself when he failed to

consider that the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond

reasonable doubt?

Before the commencement of the argument, the Counsel appearing for the

Respondent raised a preliminary objection based on his written submissions.

The preliminary objection being that in the Petition of Appeal the Appellant

has named the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or

5 | P a g e

Corruption as the Respondent whereas he should have named the Director

General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption

as the Respondent. He relied on several judgments mentioned in his written

submissions to substantiate his preliminary objection.

In reply the Learned Presidents Counsel moved this court that he be allowed

to amend the Petition of Appeal as the hearing of this appeal has not yet

commenced. He further elaborated that such amendment will not cause any

prejudice to the Respondent since the Respondent has been properly

represented and written submissions have also been filed.

After considering the submissions of both parties, the court is of the view

that since it is clear that, the mistake committed by the Counsel who filed

the Petition of Appeal has not caused any prejudice to either party, allowing

the Appellant to amend the caption of the Petition of Appeal is in the interest

of justice rather than dismissing an appeal of a person without giving him a

fair hearing, this court allowed the amendment of the caption of the Petition

of Appeal by adding the Director General of the Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption as the 2nd Complainant-Respondent.

Hence, the preliminary objection raised by the Respondent was rejected and

the argument was taken up.

Background of the case.

The complainant is a three-wheeler driver by profession and is also engaged

in business related to illicit liquor as well. On 18/06/2008 while he was

driving his three-wheeler with 3 cans of illicit liquor, a gas cooker and a gas

cylinder at Koswatta, in the Kosgama Police area, two police officers had

stopped his three-wheeler. One of the police officers who stopped the three-

wheeler is said to be the Appellant. A person called Rasika was also in the

three-wheeler. As the Appellant directed the complainant to take his vehicle

to the police station for the purpose of filing an action, the complainant had

pleaded that he be excused, as the complainants father had passed away

6 | P a g e

only three months ago. At that time the Appellant had demanded Rs.50000/-

to refrain from filing an action against him. Following a discussion, the

amount was reduced to Rs.15000/. According to the complainant, the

Appellant had given several phone calls to claim this amount. In the

meantime, the complainant had lodged a complaint at the Bribery

Commission and a raid was organized. The Appellant was arrested on

20/06/2008 upon receiving the money from the complainant in the presence

of the Bribery officials.

The defence denied the charge and adduced evidence to show that he was

arrested on fabricated evidence due to a personal enmity that existed against

a police officer namely PC Wasantha who was attached to Kosgama Police

Station earlier and was transferred to the Bribery Commission thereafter. At

the time of alleged raid, he was said to be a member of the Bribery Team but

was not called to give evidence for the prosecution.

As all three grounds of appeal involve the standard of proof in a criminal

trial, I decided to consider all these appeal grounds together in the judgment.

In a criminal trial, it is incumbent on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt. There is no burden on the Appellant to prove his

innocence. This is the Golden Thread as discussed in Woolmington v. DPP

[1935] A.C.462. In this case Viscount Sankey J held that:

Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is

always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the

prisoners guilt If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there

is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the

prosecution or the prisoner..the prosecution has not made out the case

and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.

According to the complainant when he was driving the three-wheeler, he was

accompanied by a person called Rasika (P2). But he was not called to give

evidence to corroborate the evidence of the complainant. Further the police

7 | P a g e

officer who was allegedly with the Appellant when the three-wheeler was

stopped was also not called by the prosecution. Further, he was not even

named in the indictment. The complainants position was that he was

released by the Appellant after detecting three cans of illicit liquor and a gas

cooker with a cylinder in the three-wheeler. The reason was that the

Appellant had demanded money. The Appellants position was that at the

relevant time he was at the police station. PW7, the Officer-in Charge of the

Kosgama Police Station, under cross examination endorsed the fact that the

Appellant was at the Kosgama Police Station as per the police record, which

had not been contradicted by the prosecution.

Under these circumstances not calling the above-mentioned witnesses by the

prosecution creates a doubt as to whether the event actually took place on

18/06/2008 as stated by the complainant.

It is a well-established rule of law that it is not necessary to call a certain

number of witnesses to prove a fact. However, if court is not impressed with

the cogency and the convincing character of the evidence of the sole

testimony of the witnesses, it is incumbent on the prosecution to corroborate

the evidence as stated in Sunil v. AG [1999] 3 SLR 191 where it was held:

It is trite law that the trial judge who hears a bribery trial is entitled to

convict on the sole testimony of a prosecution witness without any

corroboration provided he is impressed with the cogency, convincing

character of the evidence and the testimonial trustworthiness of the sole

witness.

It is an incorrect statement of the law to hold that a reasonable doubt

arises on the mere fact that the prosecution case rested on the

uncorroborated evidence of a solitary prosecution witness.

It is incomprehensible why the prosecution did not call, at least one of the

persons who were present when the Appellant solicited the gratification. This

also makes the story of the complainant open to doubt.

8 | P a g e

In Walimunige John and Another v. The State 76 NLR 488 the court held:

The question of a presumption arises only where a witness whose

evidence is necessary to unfold the narrative is withheld by the

prosecution and the failure to call such a witness constitutes a vital

missing link in the prosecution case and where the reasonable inference

to be drawn from the omission to call the witness is that he would, if

called, not have supported the prosecution. But where one witnesss

evidence is cumulative of the other and would be a mere repetition of the

narrative, it would be wrong to direct a jury that the failure to call such

witness gives rise to a presumption under section 114(f) of the Evidence

Ordinance.

In Beddewithana v. The Attorney General [1990] 1 SLR 275 the court held:

I am however in agreement with the submission of Counsel for the

appellant, that it would be unsafe to permit the conviction of the accused

appellant in this case, to stand in the absence of any corroborative

evidence to support the evidence of the virtual complainant Cader

Ibrahim, in regard to the purpose for which the money was accepted as

set out in the indictment. On an examination of the totality of the

evidence of this case, it is clear, that there is no independent

corroboration of the evidence of the virtual complainant, either in respect

of the allegation that the accused-appellant accepted a sum of Rs.5 as

an inducement or a reward to perform an official act, or that he accepted

a sum of Rs.20 on 11.1.75 for the same purpose. There is no

corroboration of the evidence of the virtual complainant Cader Ibrahim

in respect of the charge set out in count (3) as well.

. I am therefore, of the opinion that in the absence of any

corroborative evidence relating to the purpose for which the accused-

9 | P a g e

appellant accepted this money it would be unsafe to permit a conviction

of the accused-appellant on charges under the Bribery Act to stand.

When documentary evidence confirms that the Appellant was at the police

station when he solicited the said gratification from the complainant, I

consider it very important to call corroborative evidence to confirm the

evidence of the complainant as his evidence stands in isolation. In the light

of the failure to call corroborative evidence in this case, when there were

several witnesses present, there is a reasonable doubt that there was

solicitation by the appellant on the date specified in the indictment. The

benefit of that doubt must accrue to the Appellant.

The Appellants position was that at the time the solicitation took place he

was at the Kosgama Police Station. This has been confirmed by PW7 with

documentary evidence. When this position was put forward by the defence,

the prosecution has not raised any objection under Section 126A (1) of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

As per this section one of three pre-requisite conditions should be fulfilled

when the defence of alibi is raised. However, the proviso to the Section 126A

(1) permits the court to exercise a discretion in allowing an alibi

notwithstanding the fact that the accused was delayed in raising such alibi

set out in the section.

The High Court Judge in his judgment considered the defence of alibi

evidence adduced by the Appellant but placed the burden of proving the

defence on the Appellant. It is trite law that when a defence of alibi is taken

out there is no burden whatsoever on the Appellant to prove the same. This

position is supported by several judicial decisions.

In Banda and Others v. Attorney General [1999] 3 SLR 168 the court held:

there is no burden whatsoever on an accused who puts forward a

plea of alibi and the burden is always on the prosecution to establish

10 | P a g e

beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was not elsewhere but

present at the time of the commission of the criminal offence.

Although the prosecution witness No.7 stated in his evidence that the

Appellant was at the Kosgama Police station on 18/06/2008 between 2.30

p.m. to 3.00 p.m. the Learned High Court judge speculated that the

Appellant could have left the police station and gone to Eswatta. In the

absence of any cogent evidence, the court cannot speculate anything against

the Appellant. This clearly shows the prejudicial mind set of the Learned

High Court judge who delivered the judgment.

The prosecution evidence further revealed the inclusion of a police officer

namely, PC Wasantha in the Bribery Team. Police officer PC Wasantha had

worked with the Appellant at the Kosgama Police Station before he was

transferred to the Bribery Commission. PC Wasantha has had some

animosity with the Appellant as he had purposefully avoided attending the

courts to give evidence against the illicit liquor manufacturers and the

sellers. On one such incident the complainant was discharged due to the

absence of the police officer PC Wasantha. As the Appellant was the court

officer of Kosgama Police Station, all such times the court had found fault

with him and had taken steps to severely reprimand him.

PW6 in his evidence admitted the inclusion of police officer PC Wasantha

who had worked in the Kosgama Police Station earlier. He is a resident of

Awissawella area. According to the defence he is well acquainted with the

complainant. The inclusion of police officer, PC Wasantha in the raiding team

creates serious doubt as he went to arrest a former colleague of his. This is

a very conflicting situation as the defence had raised the mala fedei intention

of the police officer PC Wasantha. Although this a very serious matter which

affects the genuinity of the raiding team, this factor has not been adequately

considered by the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment.

11 | P a g e

The Appellant in his dock statement stated that during his stay at the

Kosgama Police Station he had conducted a number of raids to eradicate the

illicit liquor problems from the area. In recognition of his service the Police

Department had rewarded him with cash gifts up to about Rs.300,000/-.

Further he had arrested the complainant on a warrant and remanded him.

Also, he had arrested the complainants wife, Complainants brother-in-law

and another person regarding illicit liquor business and produced them

before court. Hence, the Appellant was a great obstacle to the complainants

smooth running of his illicit liquor business.

Professor G.L.Peiris in his book Recent Trends in the Commonwealth

Law of Evidence at page 311 states as follows:

Where the evidence, viewed as whole, admits some degree of doubt,

this doubt may be reinforced by evidence of good character which, to

that extent, could facilitate an acquittal in marginal cases.

The Professor further states at page 310 as follows:

No distinction can be made convincingly between evidence of good

character going to credibility and evidence of good character having a

bearing on the issue of guilt or innocence, since these strands are

incapable in practice of being disentangled. If the trial judge directed

the jury that the appellant was more credible by reason of his good

character, it would have followed from that that he was less likely to

commit the offence. (R v. Bellis [1966] 1 All E.R. 552; of R v

Richardson and Longman [1969] 1 QB 299)

Guided by the above cited judgments, when considering the totality of the

evidence it is crystal clear that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond

reasonable doubt that there was solicitation by the Appellant on the date

specified in the indictment.

12 | P a g e

Also, the prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the

Appellant had accepted the gratification on the date specified in the

indictment.

As the prosecution has failed to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt

against the Appellant, I allow the appeal and acquit him from all the charges.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court

of Colombo along with the original case record.
