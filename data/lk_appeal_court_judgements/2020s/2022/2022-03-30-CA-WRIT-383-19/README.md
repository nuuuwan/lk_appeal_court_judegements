Before: M. T. Mohammed Laffar, J. and S. U. B. Karalliyadde, J. Counsel: Prinath Fernando for the Petitioner. Nayomi Kahavita, S.C., for the Respondents Argued on: 12.01.2022. Written Submissions on: 22.02.2022 (by the Petitioner) Not tendered (by the Respondent) Decided on: 30.03.2022

Mohammed Laffar, J.

The Petitioner in this application is seeking, inter alia, mandates in the

nature of a writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the Respondents

marked P20 (a) and a Mandamus compelling the Respondents to grant

the pension entitlements of W.M.K.G. Sunil Shantha Bandara to the

Petitioner.

The Petitioner is the mother of W.M.K.G. Sunil Shantha Bandara who was

serving as a Teacher in Agricultural Science from 02.01.1984. While in

service, the said W.M.K.G. Sunil Shantha Bandara went missing since

10.08.1989. As per the Death Certificate bearing No. 3595 marked P4,

the said W.M.K.G. Sunil Shantha Bandara, who was unmarried, demised

on 10.08.1989.

After making several appeals to the appropriate authorities, the salary of

the said deceased W.M.K.G. Sunil Shantha Bandara was paid to the

Petitioner and her husband in 2003 until the 55th birthday of the said

deceased (up to 20.10.2014). Thereafter by letter dated 23.11.2015,

W.M.K.G. Sunil Shantha Bandara, was confirmed in service and

accordingly, promotions were granted to him. As per the document

Page 3 of 6

marked P21, the Petitioners husband, W.M.K.G. Tikiribanda (W.M.K.G.

Shantha Bandaras father) died on 14.01.2017.

Subsequently, the Petitioner, in terms of the Public Administration

Circular No. 343 (marked P18), claimed the pension entitlements of

W.M.K.G. Sunil Shantha Bandara. The 2nd Respondent (Assistant Director

of Pension) on behalf of the 1st Respondent (Director General of Pension)

in the document dated 28.10.2016 marked P20 (a) has taken a decision

that the Petitioner is not entitled to the pension of her deceased son in

terms of the Public Administration Circular No. 22/93 iv marked P20

(b).

The Petitioner states that the said decision marked P20 (a), not to grant

the pension of W.M.K.G. Sunil Shantha Bandara to the Petitioner, is in

violation (ultra vires) of Public Administration Circular No. 21/88

marked P6, Public Administration Circular No. 59/89 marked P7, Public

Administration Circular No. 343 marked P18, Public Administration

Circular No. 369 marked P24 and section 39 of the Minutes on Pensions

marked P25. The Petitioner also states that the said decision contained in

P20 (a) is in violation of natural justice which has been taken without a

hearing to her.

In these circumstances, the Petitioner seeks a mandate in the nature of

writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the Respondents marked P20

(a) and a Mandamus compelling the Respondents to grant the pension

entitlements of W.M.K.G. Sunil Shantha Bandara to the Petitioner.

The contention of the Respondents is that, as per the provisions of section

27 of the Widows and Orphans Pension Fund Ordinance No. 1 of 1898

(as amended), only the spouse and orphaned children of the deceased

public officer shall become entitled to receive the said benefits and there

is no specific mention about the parents of a deceased public officer in

Page 4 of 6

the said section. They further argue that section 39 (1) of the Minutes of

Pension has no application to the facts of this case.

In the circumstances, the question for determination in this application

is as to whether the Petitioner who is the mother of the said deceased

public officer is entitled to the pension of the deceased.

The Respondents, in their objections, took up the position that the

aforesaid Public Administration Circulars marked P6, P7, P18 and P24

are applicable to the public officers who are dead or injured due to

terrorist activities.

In terms of the provisions of section 27 of the Widows and Orphans

Pension Fund Ordinance (as amended), only the spouse and orphaned

children of the deceased public officer shall become entitled to receive

the said benefits which reads thus,

The widows and orphans entitled to pensions from the fund are the widows and orphans of public officers who have contributed to the fund in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance or Ordinances Nos. 20 of 1885 and 21 of 1896, save as hereinafter excepted

However, it is to be noted that the said section cannot be considered in

isolation, and section 27 of the said Ordinance has to be read with the

Public Administration Circulars marked P6, P7, P18 and P24. As per the

Public Administration Circular marked P7, P18 and P24, it is abundantly

clear that the dependents of an unmarried deceased public officer, who

died due to terrorist activities, are entitled to the pension of the said

officer.

The said Sunil Shantha Bandara was missing since 10.08.1989. In terms

of the Death Certificate marked P4, he was missing for more than one

year and therefore, it has been presumed that he is dead. According to

the documents produced by the Petitioner and the Respondents it has

Page 5 of 6

been presumed that the said Sunil Shantha Bandara had died due to

terrorist activities, that fact has not been disputed by the Respondents in

this application.

In the document marked P20 (a), the Department of Pensions has

admitted the fact that the said Public Officer had died due to terrorist

activities, which reads thus,

.... .

The aforesaid fact is further substantiated in the document marked P13

as well, which reads thus,

.... (..)

Having scrutinized the documents tendered by both parties and the

submissions of the Counsel, it is clear that there is no dispute as to the

fact that the said W.M.K.G. Sunil Shantha Bandara died due to terrorist

activities.

Besides, in terms of section 39 (3) (i) of the Minutes on Pensions marked

P25, the heirs of an unmarried deceased Public Officer are entitled to the

pension of the said officer, which reads thus,

3 (i) Where the deceased pensioner dies leaving no widow or children, such gratuity, pension or allowance shall be paid to the heirs of the deceased according to the law of intestacy applicable to the case may be...

The learned State Counsel for the Respondents has not adduced

acceptable reasons as to why section 39 (3) (i) of the Minutes on Pensions

is not applicable to the Petitioner in the instant application.

In the circumstances, it is the considered view of this Court that the

Petitioner in this application, who is the dependent/heir (mother) of the

said deceased unmarried public officer is entitled to the pension of the

said officer in terms of section 27 of the Widows and Orphans Pension

Fund Ordinance read with Public Administration Circulars marked P7,

P18, P24 and section 39 (3) (i) of the Minutes on Pensions marked P25.

As such, the decision not to grant the pension of W.M.K.G. Sunil Shantha

Bandara, which is set out in P20 (a), to the Petitioner is in violation of the

Public Administration Circulars marked P7, P18, P24 and section 39 (3)

(i) of the Minutes on Pensions marked P25. In these respects, the

impugned decision is ultra vires and bad in law, and accordingly liable

to be quashed.

For the above reasons, I proceed to allow this application.

Accordingly, a writ of Certiorari to quash the decision marked P20 (a)

and a writ of Mandamus compelling the Respondents to grant the

pension of W.M.K.G. Sunil Shantha Bandara to the Petitioner are issued

as prayed for in the prayers (c) and (d) of the petition dated 05.09.2019.

I make no order as to costs.
