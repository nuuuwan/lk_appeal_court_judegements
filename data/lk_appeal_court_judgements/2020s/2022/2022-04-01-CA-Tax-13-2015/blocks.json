When Parliament lays down a statutory requirement for the exercise of legal authority it expects its authority to be obeyed down to the minutest detail.

I am not sure that it is the most fortunate language that could have been adopted to express the idea that it is intended to convey; but still, that is the recognized language, and I propose to adhere to it. The real question in all these cases is this: A thing has been ordered by the legislature to be done. What is the consequence if it is not done? In the case of statutes that are said to be imperative, the Courts have decided that if it is not done the whole thing fails, and the proceedings that follow upon it are all voids. On the other hand, when the Courts hold a provision to be mandatory or directory, they say that, although such provision may not have been complied with, the subsequent proceedings do not fail. Still, whatever the language, the idea is a perfectly distinct one. There may be many provisions in Acts of Parliament which, although they are not strictly obeyed, yet do not appear to the Court to be of that material importance to the subject-matter to which they refer, as that the legislature could have intended that the non-observance of them should be followed by a total failure of the whole proceedings. On the other hand, there are some provisions in respect of which the Court would take an opposite view, and would feel that they are matters which must be strictly obeyed, otherwise the whole proceedings that subsequently follow must come to an end.",

    "text": "When the provisions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and the case is such that to hold null and void acts done in neglect of this duty would work serious general inconvenience, or injustice to persons who have no control over those entrusted with the duty, and at the same time would not promote the main object of the Legislature, it has been the practice to hold such provisions to be directory only, the neglect of them, though punishable, not affecting the validity of the acts done. This principle has been applied to provisions for holding sessions at particular times and places (2 Hale, P. C., p. 50, Rex v. Leicester Justices (1827) 7 B & C. 6 and Parke B. in Gwynne v. Burnell (1835) 2 Bing. N.C. 7); to provisions as to rates (Reg. v. Inhabitants of Fordham (1839) 11 Ad. & E. 73 and Le Feuvre v. Miller (1857) 26 L.J. (M.C.) 175); to provisions of the Ballot Act (Woodward v. Sarsons (1875) L.R. 10 C.P. 733 and Phillips v. Goff (1886) 17 Q.B.D. 805); and two justices acting without having taken the prescribed oath, whose acts are not held invalid (Margate Pier Co. v. Hannam (1819) 3 B. & Al. 266).",

It must therefore be given its ordinary meaning, or perhaps I should say one of its ordinary meanings, to be selected according to context. Clearly, if it is given one of its ordinary meanings the travelers may be said to have \"exported the goods themselves, for they carried them (if small enough) onto the plane personally, keeping them in their possession while the plane flew out of New Zealand. And no different result follows in the case of the larger packages which were put into the plane's hold, of which the passenger-purchasers doubtless must be deemed to have had possession at the time when they were taken out of the country. But should the word \"export so be read, as referring to what these people did, if proper regard is had to the context in which that word is found in s 129B, and if the acknowledged purpose of that section is remembered? The legislation is plainly addressed to those persons, and to those alone, who increase the foreign exchange reserves of New Zealand, by sending goods abroad, or causing them to be sent abroad, receiving in return foreign exchange for which they are bound to account, and do account, to the Reserve Bank. It is clear that even if the travelers may be regarded as themselves \"exporting the goods, the word \"export where used in the section must also clearly be applicable to those, such as respondent company, who send the goods abroad, or cause them to be sent, with this result. Surely a dairy company \"exports butter, and a fruit cannery \"exports its manufactures, whether it ships the goods to its own order in another country, or sells here f.o.b. to a foreign person or corporation, provided simply that the transaction is one in which it causes goods to be sent abroad in exchange for foreign currency which it receives and for which it accounts. it is to be observed however that s. 129B is solely concerned with the actions of vendors. In our opinion a vendor may export either by taking or by sending. There will be many cases where it can be said that the buyer exports by taking, as for example in the case of an ordinary contract.",
