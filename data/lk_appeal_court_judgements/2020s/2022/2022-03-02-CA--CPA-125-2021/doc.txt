Decided on 02.03.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to revise the order dated

16.1.2020 of the learned High Court Judge of Kuliyapitiya.

The accused petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) was

indicted in the High Court of Kuliyapitiya along with seven others for

robbery and unlawful assembly.

The Counsel appearing for the petitioner had made an application to

recall witness nu 3, 4, and 5 under section 48 of the Judicature Act.

The learned High Court Judge hearing the submissions of both parties

had refused the application.

Being aggrieved by the said order the instant application has been

filed.

It is the contention of the Counsel for the Petitioner that prior to him

making the application before the incumbent High Court Judge he

had made it before the High Court Judge who had presided before on

14.12 2017 and the order had not been pronounced., and trial had

proceeded but when the said High Court Judge had gone on transfer

the instant application has been made in the year 2020, that is after 2

years.

The respondents objected and stated that the Counsel appearing for

the Petitioner had waited for two years after making the initial

application without obtaining an order and now he is making the

application in order to delay the conclusion of the trial. The Counsel

further averred that the petitioner had always been represented by a

counsel and cross examination had taken place and the Counsel

appearing now had come late to the case.

If one may go through section 48 of the Judicature Act pertaining to

this matter it says that the accused can demand that the witnesses

be resumoned and reheard.

But in the section above it says that the judge may resummon

witnesses if he thinks fit. Therefore it clearly gives the judge the

discretion to see whether justice demands that the witnesses should

be resummoned.

At this juncture this Court notes that the prime duty of the judiciary is

to safe guard the rights of the people as enshrined by the Constitution

chapter xv therefore the legislature cannot impose a fetter on the

discretion of Court , as such section 48 of the judicature act gives a

discretion to the judge to decide whether recalling of witnesses are

needed.

In the instant matter the petitioner had been represented by a

counsel right through out and the Counsel appearing for the

petitioner had come late to the case but nevertheless he had made an

application as way back as in 2017 but he had failed to obtain an

order, and thus had waited for two long years to make another

application. He claims that the judge had given him an undertaking

but the said undertaking is not recorded anywhere in the brief.

As such this Court sees no exceptional reason which shocks the

conscious of this Court to invoke the revisionary powers of this Court.

As such the instant application for revision is hereby dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Neil Iddawala J.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
