Facts in brief As per the evidence of the prosecution, the PW1 (husband) and PW2 (PW1s wife) had been cleaning the front portion of the garden at about 7.00pm with PW3 who was the sister of PW2. Suddenly, three people have entered the compound through the front gate and one person has fired a few gunshots in the air. When the PW1 hit the robbers with a stone, one of the robbers have hit him on the head with the weapon he was holding. The PW1 has then felt that he was bleeding from his head. They have snatched the two gold chains that were worn",

When the PW1 was being taken to the hospital, the PW1 has seen the crowd in the neighborhood bringing along two robbers that were caught by them. However, he has not seen them properly because of the crowd and therefore he has not identified them. 4. Upon hearing about the robbery, when the police officers came to the scene, they have observed two people being held by the neighbors. Upon searching the suspects, the police have recovered the gold chain that was snatched from PW2 from the 1st appellants trouser pocket. The police have also recovered a hand bomb from the 2nd accused appellants trouser pocket. 5. When the defence was called, the 1st accused appellant has made an unsworn statement from the dock. He had been an army soldier who was injured during the war. In his statement, he has mentioned in detail about his involvement in the war and has said that he had a confused state of mind due to some incidents that happened during the war. He has said that he did not snatch any chain. The 2nd appellant has also made a statement from the dock. His position was that, he was at the beach with some friends when he heard the police coming and when he started running, he was arrested by the police. He denied any involvement in this robbery. 6. Grounds of appeal No. 1, 6 and 7 It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellants that none of the witnesses have identified the 2nd accused appellant at the trial. He further submitted that, the learned trial Judge has failed to give due consideration to the dock statement made",

There was evidence to the effect that the PW1s son has played a major role in catching the robbers. However, he was not called to give evidence by the prosecution. None of the persons who were involved in apprehending the robbers were called to give evidence. The evidence of the police officer PW7 was that, he went to the crime scene upon information by the Officer in Charge that two robbers had been apprehended by civilians.
