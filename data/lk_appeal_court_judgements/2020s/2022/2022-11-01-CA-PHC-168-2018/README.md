MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeal has been filed to set aside the order dated

29.09.2018 of the High Court of Hambanthota.

The appellant in this matter has been first noticed to collect the brief

and pay the fees on 10.01.2022.

Thereafter, the matter had been mentioned in open court on 18.02.2020

on which date written submissions of the appellant were fixed for the

01.04.2020 and the written submissions of the respondent were to be

filed on or before 10.05.2020 and the argument was fixed for the

06.06.2020

Thereafter, this matter was removed from the argument list because the

respondent had notified Court that the appellant had failed to file the

written submissions on 10.05.2020.

Thereafter, the matter had been re-fixed for argument on 12.09.2022.

Then, on 31.08.2022, the State Counsel had filed a fresh motion stating

that argument may be re-fixed because the appellant has not filed any

written submissions.

Thereafter, when the matter was taken up on 12.09.2022, the Counsel

appearing for the appellant wanted the case to be refixed on the basis of

a personal difficulty. The appellant was totally unaware as to the

position of the written submissions, and Court directed that there is no

inclination on the part of Court to grant a postponement but fixed the

matter for the judgment and directed the appellant to file written

submissions if any on or before 19.09.2022. But the appellant has failed

Page 5 of 7

to file written-submissions as directed but the respondent had filed

written submissions.

According to Court of Appeal Rules 4 (2), No party to an appeal shall be

entitled to be heard unless he has previously lodged three copies of his

written submissions (hereinafter referred to as Submissions),

complying with the provisions of this rule.

Section 4(6) states as below, Where a party fails to lodge submissions,

or lodges submissions which are not in compliance with the foregoing

provisions, the Court may restrict the duration of the oral submissions of

such party at the hearing of the appeal or application to 45 minutes.

But in the instant matter the appellant failing to file written submissions

on 01.04.2022 had not divulged the same to Court, upon the matter being

fixed for argument on 06.06.2022 and on 12.09.2022 makes an

application for the matter to be refixed for argument on personal

grounds, the said application has not been notified to Court and neither

to the other party by way of a motion as a matter of courtesy. Therefore,

the appellant has in fact violated the Court of Appeal Rules and moreover

has scant disregard for the traditions followed in the Superior Courts. As

such this matter was fixed for judgment but still the Court of Appeal gave

the 19.09.2022 for the appellant to file a written submission if any.

The petitioner in the instant matter, has employed the accused namely

Abdul CaderHaseem to look after 27 heads of cattle. The accused had

been arrested for offences under the Animals Act. He had pleaded guilty.

The petitioner had claimed the cattle and an inquiry has been held and

upon the conclusion of the said inquiry, the Magistrate has held that the

Page 6 of 7

petitioner has failed to establish before the Magistrate that she had

ownership of the cattle in terms of the provisions of the relevant act.

The law relating to the instant matter falls within the Animals Act no 29 of

1958 and it has specifically stated as to how a cattle owner should

prepare the cattle voucher in terms of the Animals Act of No.29 of 1958 to

be read with the Gazette Notification dated 26/11/2009 which has said

that any cattle sold, the buyer and the owner of the cattle shall sign the

cattle voucher before the Government Veterinary Surgeon of the area in

which the cattle is kept and the Government Veterinary Surgeon shall

handover the perfected cattle voucher to the buyer or the new owner of

the cattle, but the document marked as E1 submitted by the petitioner

at the inquiry is not in compliance of the said regulation. Therefore the

Magistrate had disregarded her evidence and has confiscated the cattle.

This matter has been discussed in the case of CA (PHC) APN 22/2018 by

this bench on 08.03.2022 where it has discussed the Cattle Voucher which

should be in the possession of a person who claims ownership to cattle

under the provisions of the Animals Act No.29 of 1958, Section 3(d) 6, 7,

8(2).

Therefore as the petitioner has failed to produce the relevant documents

in compliance of the act, Learned High Court Judge has observed that

there is no exceptional illegality in the Order of the Magistrate.

Therefore as per the law cited above we do not see any reason to

interfere with the judgment of the learned High Court Judge hence the

instant application is hereby dismissed.
