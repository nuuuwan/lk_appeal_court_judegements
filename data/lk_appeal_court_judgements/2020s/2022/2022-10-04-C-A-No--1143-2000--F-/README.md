Judgment

The Plaintiff instituted the instant action to partition the land namely Kakungahawatte

alias Mawathahena described in the 2nd schedule to the amended plaint dated

05.11.1983. The said 2nd schedule which described the corpus of the instant action is as

follows:

(Dead)

Page 6 of 16

,

. . ,

,

,

(4,2,0)

.

.. 15.09.1980

. 1352 1 9

(5,0,34.5) .

It appears that the corpus of the instant action is a divided portion of a large land called

and known as Kakungahawatte alias Mawathahena, 16 acres in extent; which is

described in the 1st schedule to the amended plaint.

According to the Plaintiff, the original owners of the said large land were Baron

Athukorala and Ariyapperuma Ramanayakege Maththes Police Vidana Rala. They got

rights upon the said land by Deed bearing No. 783 dated 22.10.1855.

Thereafter, the said Baron Athukorala was in possession of the Northern half share of

the said land and said Police Vidana Rala was in possession of the Southern half share

of the large land. Later, the said Baron Athukorala and Police Vidana by mutual

agreement separately possessed the said Northern and Southern portions and became

separately entitled to the same by title and as well as prescriptive possession.

The amended plaint proceeded to state that the said Baron Athukorala who separately

possessed the said Northern portion of the land died leaving his children Luci Hamy alias

Page 7 of 16

Laiso Hamy, Pesona Hamy, Don Abraham, Don Davith and Marthina Hamy. However,

said Marthina Hamy died unmarried and issueless whose half share of the property

devolved according to paragraph 3 of the amended plaint.

A portion of the said land had been offered for Sangha and it is separately possessed by

the temple. After the said portion was offered to the temple, the parties possessed the

remaining land as separate portions and out of that, a portion of 4 and half acres was

subject to a partition action bearing No. 3221/P and the remaining portion which is

described in the 2nd schedule to the plaint is the subject matter of this action.

The 2nd schedule runs as follows;

2 :

:

,

. . ,

,

,

(4,2,0)

.

.. 15.09.1980

. 1352 1 9

(5,0,34.5) .

Thereafter, the Plaintiff averred how the title devolved in the rest of the averments

and prayed for a partition decree according to the shares mentioned therein.

However, the 10th to 16th Defendants in their amended statement of claim denied the

devolution of title and specifically stated that they do not accept the preliminary plan

Page 8 of 16

bearing No. 1352 dated 15.09.1980 prepared by R.A. Chandrarathna licensed surveyor

which does not show the land described in the 2nd schedule to the plaint.

The said Defendants disputed the pedigree of the Plaintiff and sought a dismissal of the

Plaintiffs action.

Trial commenced afresh on the amended pleadings on 05.08.1986 and on behalf of the

Plaintiff 1st, 2nd and 3rd points of contest were raised while 1st, 3rd, 5th and 8th Defendants

raised 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th points of contest and on behalf of the 10th-16th Defendants,

8th-29th points of contest were raised. However, after the conclusion of the trial,

learned Additional District Judge dismissed the action of the Plaintiff and held,

a) That the proper co-owners of the subject matter of the action are the heirs of

Persona Hamy and Lucia Hamy, and that the heirs of Don Abraham and Don Davith had

taken their undivided rights from the corpus in action No.3221/P, and that the 5th to

the 9th Defendants do not inherit rights as they are the heirs of the said Don Davith and

Don Abraham,

b) That the 5th Defendant has acquired rights under the document 5V1 and that he is

entitled to his rights from the land, and that the Plaint is correct in respect of the rights

of the 5th Defendant.

c) That the Deed No. 10V17 marked on behalf of the 10th to 16th Defendants is a

fraudulent and invalid Deed and that several allotments of land not forming the original

land, namely Puwakgahakumbura and Puwakdolekumbura have been included in

Plan No. 912 and that 10th to 17th Defendants have not proved their tittles.

d) That the Plaintiff has not proved his title, and that Lucia Hamy and Persona Hamy

have both divested their rights by Deed No. 3136.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment, the 5th Defendant-Appellant had preferred this

appeal on the following grounds:

Page 9 of 16

a) The learned Additional District Judge erred when she held that the plaint should

be dismissed on the ground that the Plaintiff has not proved the case as this is

an action for partition and that the proper co-owners were before the court and

had proved their title, and the 5th Defendant-Appellant whose rights have been

proved, is entitled to a divided portion as pleaded by him in his statement of

claim.

b) The learned Additional District Judge failed to consider the fact that the 5th

Defendant-Appellant who had acquired the title from 5V1, which in fact has

been accepted by the Learned Additional District Judge, has a better title than

the 10th to 16th Defendant-Respondents who enjoy the property. The Learned

Additional District Judge has held that the 10th to 16th DefendantRespondents

have not proved their titles. Therefore, the Learned District Judge should have

held in favour of the 5th Defendant-Appellant who has successfully proved his

case.

c) The evidence in this case clearly proves that only the Plaintiff and the 1st to 5th

Defendants are entitled to rights and title in the land, and therefore the Plaintiff

and the 1st to 5th Defendants are entitled to have the land partitioned among

them and therefore the plaint should not have been dismissed.

d) The Judgment itself is contradictory as the Learned District Judge has held that

the heirs of Laisa Hamy and Pesona Hamy are entitled to the rights in the land,

but has also held that the Plaintiff and the 1st to 3rd Defendants had failed to file

a partition action until 1978 and therefore it is doubtful whether they had

possession. It is respectfully submitted that even if they were not in possession,

they are entitled to obtain possession and therefore have a right to have the land

partitioned.

e) The said judgment dated 06.12.2000 is not based on evidence before the Court

and therefore is unreasonable and wrong and, that the 5th Defendant-Appellant

is therefore deprived of his rights to have peaceful possession of a divided portion

of land.

It is seen that the Learned District Judge having dismissed the Plaintiffs action and also

the claim of the 5th Defendant-Appellant, the Learned Additional District Judge of

Page 10 of 16

Pugoda had not answered the 115 points of contest raised on behalf of the parties. The

learned trial Judge must examine and evaluate the evidence of the witnesses and

documents and thereupon answer all the points of contest among the parties. Further,

it should be stated why she prefers to accept the evidence of one party and refuses the

evidence of the other with reasons.

It is observable that the 5th Defendant-Appellant did not dispute the corpus and had

claimed his rights upon the statement of claim filed by the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 8th

Defendants.

The attention of Court was drawn to the points of contest No. 4, 5, 6 and 7 raised by

the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 8th Defendants.

After the hearing of the case, the learned Additional District Judge of the District Court

of Pugoda delivered her Judgment on 06.10.2000 answering the said issue Nos. 4, 5, 6,

and 7 of the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 8th Defendants as follows;

(4) .

(5)

3136(10 3)

.

6 7 3221

.

It was the contention of the 5th Defendant-Appellant that his claim cannot be rejected

by answering the above issue No.4 in their favour and upon stating erroneously that the

said Lusihamy and Pesonahamy had conveyed their rights by deed No. 3136 (10 3),

wherein, it does not refer to the corpus of the instant partition Case

KAKUNGAHAWATTE but it is for some other land called MAWATHHENA. Therefore,

the land referred to in the former partition Case 3221/P depicted in the said preliminary

Page 14 of 16

plan No.1352 vide second schedule of the amended plaint dated 05.09.1983 has not

referred to a land called MAWATHHENA, whereby the 5th Defendant-Appellant got title

by deed No. 3516 (5 1), to KAKUNGAHAWATTE which is the corpus to be partitioned

and therefore the said issue No.5 should have been decided in favour of the 1st, 3rd, 5th

and 8th Defendants.

It is to be noted that the learned Additional District Judge had stated in the Judgment

.

However, learned Additional District Judge had answered the points of contest 1, 2,

3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 10 vaguely and had not answered the points of contest 11,12,13,14

and 15. It is relevant to note that the learned Additional District Judge had not properly

analyzed and evaluated the evidence placed before Court. Thus, the title of parties had

not been properly investigated. Moreover, the learned Additional District Judge had not

specifically answered to the points of contest raised in the instant action.

The case of Madduma Ralalage Sunil and others Vs. Madduma Ralalage MaryNona

and others [2016] 1 SLR 49 was a case where the learned District Judge had ordered

to partition the land. The main grievance of the Appellants against the Judgment of the

District Court was that all the issues raised at the trial were not answered by the trial

Judge and by doing so the Court has not investigated the title or parties concerned.

The Supreme Court held that the learned District Judge had not investigated a title of

the parties to the action. Justice Eva Wanasundara has observed as follows,

According to the way he has written the judgment, if it is decided that the Plaintiff is

correct, it is not necessary to look into other issues raised and/ or other claims placed

before Court by others even though they all lead evidence of the trial.

In that case the learned District Judge had failed to investigate title of all the parties

by not answering the issues raised by the Appellants on their title. The learned District

Page 15 of 16

Judge had just held that the shares should be allocated according to the pedigree of

the Plaintiff without considering the claim of the Appellants put forward in their issues.

A similar situation arose in the case of SopiNona Vs. PitipanaArachchi and two others

[2010] 1 SLR 87. In that case also, the District Judge had ordered to partition the

corpus. The Respondents allegation before the Court of Appeal was that their deeds

were not at all considered. The learned District Judge had decided on the allocation of

shares in accordance with the pedigree of the Plaintiff without examining the title of

all the parties and without examining and considering the deeds produced by the

Appellants. Thus, the learned District Judge failed to analyze the totality of the

evidence led at the trial. The learned District Judge had answered only one issue-

namely issue No. 01 raised by the Plaintiff which he had answered in the affirmative.

That issue was based not only on the devolution of title of the Plaintiff but also on the

prescriptive rights of the Plaintiff. Therefore, it became necessary to consider and

analyze the evidence to ascertain whether parties disclosed in the plaint had prescribed

the land in question. However, the learned District Judge had failed to do.

In view of the aforementioned judicial decisions, it is pertinent to note that it is a prime

duty of a trial judge to examine and evaluate the totality of the evidence available and

answer all the points of contest giving reasons as to why they are accepted or rejected.

At the commencement of the trial, all parties had formulated 29 points of contest.

However, the learned trial Judge had answered only 1-10 points of contest and had not

answered points of contest 11-29 after going through the entire trial.

Presumably, if the learned trial Judge analyzed and considered the evidence led on

points of contest and answered the rest of the issue, the decision would have been

different. It is observable that the learned Trial Judge had not analyzed and evaluated

the evidence with regard to the investigation of title.

Thus, I hold that the Judgment of the learned Additional District Judge is a nullity.

Hence, we set aside the Judgment of the District Court dated 06.10.2000 and send this

case back to the District Court of Pugoda directing the present District Judge to adopt

Page 16 of 16

the evidence placed before court and write a fresh Judgment on the available evidence

answering all the points of contest raised at the trial, within 3 months from the date of

this Judgment.

The Registrar is directed to send this case record back to the District Court of Pugoda

forthwith. Thus, we allow the appeal of the 5th Defendant-Appellant.

Appeal allowed.
