Argued on: 31.03.2022

Decided on: 05.05.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to set aside the order

dated 17.9.2021 of the High Court of Panadura.

In the instant matter the suspect namely Rajagalgodage Sugath Kumara

was taken in to custody at Anuradhapura along with 3 others on

suspicion of 10.3.2021.

Thereafter the Counsel for the suspect alleges that on a statement

made by the suspect a parcel containing a substance which had been

suspected to be heroin had been recovered from his residence.

The main contention of the Counsel for the suspect is that it is highly

improbable that a person taken into custody on suspicion would make a

statement incriminating himself and would forthwith guide the police

to recover a parcel of heroin.

This apparently is the only piece of evidence against the suspect.

Page 4 of 6

The Counsel for the respondents submitted that the suspect had

pending and previous cases of similar nature which the suspect has

failed to disclose in the petition, which the Counsel for the suspect

admitted. The Counsel for the respondents further submitted that the

IB extracts have been handed over and the indictment would be

forwarded in due course.

But the Counsel for the suspect strenuously submitted that the

evidence against the suspect is insufficient to secure a conviction.

Therefore at this juncture what this Court has to consider is whether

this Court can consider evidence in a case in an application for bail.

The suspect in the instant matter has been taken in to custody under

the provisions of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act No. 13 of

1984, according to which bail can be considered under Section 83 of the

said act only upon exceptional circumstances. The term exceptional has

not been defined in the act but in several of our decided cases many

instances have been decided to be exceptional, such as

1) The gravity of the offence, 2) The severity of the sentence, 3) The culpability of the suspect, 4) The health of the suspect, 5) Delay, which had been set out in Carder vs. OIC Narcotics Bureau

2006 3 SLR by Basnayake J.

In the instant matter what had been urged to be exceptional is the

improbability of the nature of the evidence and the entirety of the

case being based on a Section 27(1) recovery.

Page 5 of 6

The Counsel for the respondents did not deny the fact that the

entirety of the case is based on a Section 27(1) recovery. At this

juncture this Court diverts its attention to a full bench judgment of

their Lordships in the Supreme Court where the former Chief Justice

Priyasath Dep had analyzed what weight should be attached to a

Section 27(1) recovery led in evidence and if that is the only piece of

evidence.

In the case of Duminda de Silva and others vs. the AG their

Lordships have held that The effect of a statement made under

Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance is that the accused had the

knowledge of the place where the item was kept hidden. Solely on

that evidence individual liability could not be established. The

accused cannot be convicted of joint possession

Therefore in the instant matter the only item of evidence against

the suspect at this stage it appears to be the recovery of the parcel

of heroin on a Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance, which in

the opinion of this Court is insufficient to implicate the suspect for

exclusive possession of heroin.

At this point the Counsel for the Attorney General may argue that

facts in a case cannot be gone into in an application for bail. But

this Court draws its attention to the judgment cited by the Counsel

for the suspect by his Lordship Sisira De Abrew J in CA (PHC)

APN9/2010 in which Justice Sisira De Abrew has held that in the

B report by the police the police have failed to indicate the

particular place of the body from which the heroin was found(the

Page 6 of 6

body of the suspect). And has held that therefore it is only fair to

en large the suspect on bail.

Therefore in the instant matter in view of the material stated

above this Court is of the opinion that the learned High Court

Judge has failed to consider the above mentioned material in the

impugned order which makes it an exceptional circumstance to set

aside the said order dated 17.9.2021 and enlarge the above

mentioned suspect on bail.

Therefore the instant application for revision is allowed and this

Court directs the learned High Court Judge to enlarge the above

mentioned suspect on suitable conditions of bail. As such the

instant application for revision is allowed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
