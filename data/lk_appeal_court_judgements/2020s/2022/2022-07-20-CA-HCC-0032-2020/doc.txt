Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Chilaw on following counts.

1. For causing injuries to Palugahathannegedara Nandawathi on 20th July

2014 using an axe and thereby committing the offence of attempted

murder, punishable in terms of Section 300 of the Penal Code.

2. At the same time and at the same transaction, causing simple hurt to

Raghavan Kumara, an offence punishable in terms of section 314 of the

Penal Code.

When the appellant was charged before the high Court, he has pleaded guilty to

both the counts preferred against him. After hearing the learned Counsel on

behalf of the appellant and the learned State Counsel for the prosecution, on the

question of sentencing, the learned High Court Judge has imposed the following

sentence on the appellant.

1. On count one, he was sentenced to 15 years rigorous imprisonment

and a fine of Rs. 25000/-. In default, he was ordered 6 months simple

imprisonment.

2. On count two, he was sentenced to one-year rigorous imprisonment

and a fine of Rs.1000/-. In default of the fine, he was ordered 3 months

simple imprisonment.

In addition to the above punishment, he was ordered to pay Rs. 250000/- as

compensation to PW-02, who was the injured party mentioned in count one and

Rs. 50000/- to PW-01, who was the injured party mentioned in relation to count

two. In default, he was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months simple imprisonment

periods respectively.

As the learned High Court Judge has not mentioned whether the period of

imprisonment imposed on count one and two are concurrent to each other or

consecutive, I find that it needs to be assumed that the sentences are consecutive

to each other.

Being aggrieved by the sentence, the appellant filed this appeal. At the hearing

of this appeal, it was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that

given the facts and the circumstances, the sentence imposed by the learned High

Court Judge on the appellant was excessive.

The learned Counsel drew the attention of the Court to the decided case of

Hattuvan Pedige Sugath Karunaratne vs. The Attorney General S.C. Appeal

32/2020, decided on 20-10-2020 in this regard, where their lordships of the

Supreme Court have considered the appropriateness of a sentence in relation to

the crime, among other matters considered.

It was the view of the learned State Counsel that the learned High Court Judge

has considered all the relevant factors before the appellant was sentenced and,

the appellant cannot bargain the sentence imposed on him. It was his view that

no material has been placed before the Court that needs the intervention of the

Court and to consider reduction of the sentence imposed on the appellant.

It needs to be mentioned that this Court is in no position to agree with the

submissions of the learned State Counsel when he said that if considered, the

Page 4 of 5

appeal of the appellant would amount to bargaining of the sentence. This Court

finds that any accused who is dissatisfied by a sentence imposed on him have a

right of appeal to the Court of Appeal challenging his sentence, which cannot be

termed as plea bargaining.

This Court finds that the appellant has pleaded guilty to the charges at the first

available opportunity. He has been a person of 28 years at the time he pleaded

guilty and the learned High Court Judge has considered his age as well as the

fact that he has been in remand custody for a long period. However, the learned

High Court Judge has considered the gravity of the injury suffered by PW-02

Nandawathi, and has expressed the opinion that persons who commit this type

of criminal acts should be punished so that the punishment would reflect a

message to the society.

It appears from the submissions made on behalf of the appellant that he is a

person of no means. Therefore, it is clear that he will not be able to pay any of

the compensation ordered. Although PW-01 had received three cut injuries

where the appellant was found guilty in terms of section 314, and PW-02 who

had received grievous injuries to her abdomen has received one cut injury. It is

clear that the appellant has caused these injuries due to a personal animosity

he had with them while working in a tile factory. When considering the fact that

the appellant has pleaded guilty to the charges at the first available opportunity,

which goes on to show that he repents his acts and also the fact that he had no

previous convictions are matters that had been considered by the learned High

Court Judge in mitigation of the sentence, I am of the view that imposing him a

total of 16 years rigorous imprisonment on both counts are too excessive

punishment in relation to the offences he was found guilty.

Having considered all the facts and the circumstances, it is the view of this Court

that a 10-year rigorous imprisonment period on count one would be an

appropriate punishment for the accused-appellant. Therefore, we set aside the

Page 5 of 5

sentence of 15 years rigorous imprisonment imposed on the appellant on count

one and replace it with a 10-year period of rigorous imprisonment.

The fine imposed on the accused-appellant on count one and the sentence and

the fine imposed on count two shall remain the same.

Considering the facts and the circumstances, we order that the appellant shall

serve the sentences imposed on count one and two concurrently. Having

considered the fact that the appellant has been in incarceration from the date of

the conviction, the sentence is ordered to be effective from 27-05-2020.

The compensation ordered and the default sentences imposed shall also remain

the same.

The appeal is allowed to the above extent.
