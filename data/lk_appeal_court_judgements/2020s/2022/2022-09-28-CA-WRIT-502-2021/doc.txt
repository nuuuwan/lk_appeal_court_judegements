Vikum de Abrew ASG, PC with Suranga Wimalasena DSG and N. De Zoysa SC for the 1st to 7th & 9th Respondents. Argued on : 06.06.2022, 03.08.2022,08.09.2022, 22.09.2022

1st to 7th & 9th Respondents- 26.09.2022

Decided on : 28.09.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioners have filed this application seeking, inter alia, an order in the nature of a

writ of Certiorari to quash the decisions contained in Ministry Circular No.

MWFC/1/2020 dated 04.11.2020, marked P7, issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of

Wildlife & Forest Conservation. An order in the nature of a writ of Certiorari is also sought

to quash the decisions reflected in letters and guidelines, marked P8 to P9(f)) & P12

made in relation to the said Circular, marked P7. Additionally, the Petitioners are seeking

an order in the nature of a writ of Mandamus directing or compelling the 6th Respondent

to take necessary measures to institute action against all individuals who have destroyed

the forests falling under the provisions of Section 20 of the Forest Ordinance as amended

by the Act No. 65 of 2009.

The said impugned Circular has been issued in relation to the Management of State forests

other than a conservation forest, reserved forest or village forest. The Petitioners

contention is that the improper use of other State forests by the Divisional Secretaries

and the District Secretaries in terms of the said Circular, marked P7, will decrease the

total forest cover of the country which is already at a critical stage. The Petitioners submit

that the Divisional Secretaries and the District Secretaries are lack of necessary scientific

knowledge to determine and deal with such forests and there appears to be a considerable

increase of incidents with regard to deforestation throughout the country during the recent

times.

Page 6 of 11

The Secretary to the Ministry of Lands has filed in this application, an Affidavit affirmed

on 04.04.2022. He categorically denies several averments contained in the Petition of the

Petitioners and submits that the Ministry of Lands and Ministry of Wildlife & Forest

Conservation have all times acted in compliance with the joint Cabinet Memorandum,

marked R1 and the decision thereto, marked R2. Further, he submits that the Circular,

marked P7, is in accordance with the said Cabinet decision and the orders sought by the

Petitioners in this application amounts to stultification of the activities of the Government

causing economic hardships to the landless people and hindering utilization of State lands

in favour of the public and for the economic development.

The learned Additional Solicitor General (ASG) who appears for the Respondents

explained the intended mechanism embodied in the impugned Circular P7 and

strenuously argued that no prejudice would be caused to any of the forest land by way of

such mechanism. He asserts that the impugned Circular is a result of a Cabinet

Memorandum submitted jointly by three Cabinet Ministers who were in charge of the

subjects of Wildlife & Forest, Environment and Land and the subsequent Cabinet decision

which is still in full force has not been challenged by the Petitioners. The contention of the

leaned ASG is that even if the impugned Circulars are quashed by this Court, any State

agency could issue another circular to implement the said Cabinet decision and therefore,

the reliefs prayed for by the Petitioners are futile. The learned ASG relies on the

judgements in Mendis, Fowzie and others vs. Goonawardena and G. P. A. Silva (1978-

79) 2 Sri. L.R. 322, University of Peradeniya vs. Justice D. G. Jayalath, Chairman,

University Services Appeals Board and others (2005) 3 Sri. L.R. 337 and Anuja

Yoganathan vs. University Grants Commission and two others, CA/Writ/664/2011

decided on 13.09.2016 and submits that our Courts have continuously held that a writ of

Certiorari is a discretionary remedy and such writ will not be issued if it be futile. The

learned ASG expounding the dicta in the above cases and cites the judgement of

Selvamani vs. Dr. Kumaravelupillai and others (2005) 1 Sri. L.R. 99 by which a writ

of Mandamus has been refused based on futility.

On a careful perusal of the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, marked R2, it appears

that the said decision R2 underlies the impugned Circular marked P7 and such Cabinet

decision is not being challenged in this application by the Petitioners. Such Ministers of

the Cabinet also have not been made a party to this application. The learned ASG relying

Page 7 of 11

on Ravaya Publishers and other vs. Wijayadasa Rajapaksha, Chairman Sri Lanka Press

Council 2001 3 SLR 213, Perera vs. National Housing Development Authority (2001)

3 Sri. L.R. 50 asserts that the application of the Petitioners should be dismissed in limine

as necessary parties are not before Court.

In such a backdrop, I am inclined to accept the submission made by the learned ASG in

respect of futility and on the necessary parties. Therefore, I hold that the Secretary to the

Ministry of Wildlife & Forest Conservation has issued the impugned Circular, marked

P7, without exceeding power and however, subject to the decision of the Cabinet of

Ministers (R2) which is still in force. Both parties at the hearing stage of this case

conceded that the impugned documents marked P8 to P9(f) emanate from the said

Circular, marked P7. I cannot agree with the submissions made subsequently by the

learned Counsel for the Petitioners attempting to differentiate P8 to P9(f) & P12 with

the main Circular marked P7. I take the view that the root cause to all subsequent

Circulars is the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers and the Circular P7 issued based on

the said Cabinet decision.

During the midst of the hearing of this application, the learned ASG brought to the

attention of this Court the motion dated 16.09.2022 filed on behalf of the Respondents. A

draft letter, marked X1, which is due to be issued by the Commissioner General of Lands

to all Divisional Secretaries/ Provincial Land Commissioners/ Land Commissioner/

Assistant Land Commissioner (Inter-Provincial) is annexed to the said motion. The said

draft letter contains a clarification as to how the Circular No. 2020/18 dated 10.11.2020,

marked as P8, should be proceeded with.

The said draft letter specifically refers to the impugned Circular, marked P7 and divulges

that the methodology introduced by the Secretary to the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest

Conservation by Circular marked as P7 does not apply to a (i) Conservation Forest,

(ii) Reserved Forest, (iii) Village Forest or (iv) Other State Forests. However, the State

lands which comes only within the following classifications will be vested in the

management of the Divisional Secretaries. Those classifications are;

i. the lands which are not identified as the lands to be conservated by Clauses 2.1

and 2.2 of Circular No. 2020/18 (of Commissioner General of Lands) and as

Page 8 of 11

further described by the Conservator General of Forests in the Circular No.

04/2020 dated 24.11.2020 (P9(a)); and

ii. areas not showing characteristics of forests

iii. State land which cannot be practically managed as forests

For the purpose of clarity, I must reproduce the exact wordings of the third paragraph of

the said letter, marked X1 which is in Sinhala language;

The averments in paragraph 76 of the Petition, in my view, encapsulate the Petitioners

main claim in this application. In a nutshell, the Petitioners primary claim is that a grave,

irremediable, permanent and irreparable loss will be caused to those invaluable Other

State Forests which, inter alia, serve as a connectivity tissue between protected areas

unless the Circulars, Guidelines and letters marked P7, P8, P9(a)-(e) and P12 are

quashed as prayed for in the Petition.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner making submissions on the said draft letter X1

has categorically submitted that the impugned issues can be resolved by ousting other

State forests from all Circulars including P7. The paragraph 39 of the final Written

Submissions filed on behalf of the Petitioner reads as follows;

It is submitted that the Respondents have deliberately made the draft very complex to use it

for their ulterior motive. The reasonable settlement to the impugned issue would have been to

oust the Other State Forests governed by Section 20 from all circulars including P7. However,

the Respondents are agreeable to such.

To my mind, there is no distinction between the above position of the Petitioners and the

substance of the said draft letter X1. The learned ASG repeatedly informed Court that

Page 9 of 11

the category of land other State forests will not be affected by the activities of the relevant

authorities when exercising their duties and functions under the said Circular P7. As I

found earlier, the Circulars P7, P8 to P9(f) are interconnected. Hence, I am not

agreeable with the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, particularly

stipulated in below mentioned paragraphs 40 & 41 of the said Written Submissions of the

Petitioner.

40) It is submitted that the draft circular submitted by the Respondents only alters the circular

marked P8 without addressing the P7 and has included section 8 of the Land Development

Ordinance which has no relevance to the issue without mentioning the Section 20 of the

Forest Ordinance which in the correct legal provision that should have been included.

41) Furthermore, the Respondents are only agreeable to alter the document marked P8 without

altering the document marked P1 and document marked P9(a) P9(f). Until and unless the

document marked P7 is altered there will not be any significant change in status quo due to

the commutative effect of all circulars issued based on the document marked P7.

In order to simply recognize the category of Other State Forests, it is important to draw

the attention to the Interpretation Section 78 of the Forest Conservation Ordinance (as

amended). According to the said Section Forest means all land at the disposal of the

State (Crown). In terms of the said section the land at the disposal of the State (Crown)

includes;

a. all forest, waste, chena, uncultivated, or unoccupied land, unless proof is adduced

to the satisfaction of the court that some person-

i. has acquired, by some lawful means, a valid title thereto, or

ii. has acquired a right thereto as against the State by the issue to him of any

certificate of no claim by the State under the State Lands Encroachments

Ordinance or the Definition of Boundaries Ordinance, or

iii. is entitled to possess the same under a written grant or lease made by or on

behalf of the British, Dutch, or Sri Lanka Governments, and duly registered

in accordance with law;

b. all lands resumed by the State under the provisions of the Land Resumption

Ordinance, and all lands which have been declared to be the property of the State

Page 10 of 11

by any order passed under The Waste Lands Ordinances, 1897 to 1903, the Land

Settlement Ordinance, or to which the State is otherwise lawfully entitled;

Now the attention should be drawn to Section 20 of the said Ordinance. The Section 20(1)

stipulates the acts which are prohibited in any Forests other than a conservation forest,

reserved forest or village forest. Thus, a State Forest other than a Conservation Forest,

Reserved Forest or Village Forest can be recognized as Other State Forests for the

purpose of matters relating to this case, however subject to the 3 classifications discussed

above and also mentioned in the draft letter X1.

In view of the above provisions of law, the Respondents argue that in terms of Section

64(2)(g), the relevant Minister is entitled to make regulations in respect of the matters set

out within any forest which is not a conservation forest, reserved forest or village forest.

Anyhow, I am of the view that whatever the regulations made by the Minister should not

override the expressed provisions of the Forest Conservation Ordinance. The hallmark of

the said ordinance is the conservation, protection and sustainable management of the

forest resources which comes under whatever heading such as conservation forest/

reserved forest/ village forest/ and other state forests.

At this stage, I advert again to the aforesaid draft letter X1. The learned ASG indicated

to Court on the final date of the hearing of this application that the Commissioner General

of Land is willing to formally issue the said draft letter, marked X1, irrespective of the

fact that the Petitioners of this case would consent to it or not. When the learned ASG, on

behalf of the Respondents submits that the category of land other State forests will not

be disturbed as narrated above, there is no necessity, in my view, for this Court to go

through a tedious process in discovering and determining on the other particulars, facts

and circumstances pleaded by the Petitioners based on the impugned Circulars.

I am aware that this is an application for judicial review and rights of the parties should be

decided as at the date of the institution of these proceedings. However, reasonable

clarification given by the relevant authorities upon an impugned decision of which the

vires is being challenged should be essentially taken into consideration in view of resolving

the questions involved. I take the view that the clarifications given by the relevant

authorities in the said document, marked X1, clears any ambiguity on the impugned

Circular P7 and the related Circulars in regard to the operation of such Circulars.

Page 11 of 11

Moreover, I am of the view that the clarifications given in the said letter, marked X1, will

be an adequate and efficacious remedy in resolving the impugned issues especially because

the instant application is a public interest litigation instituted by the Petitioner.

In light of the above, it is important for this Court to make a strong observation that the

Commissioner General of Land, Conservator General of Forests, all District Secretaries

and all Divisional Secretaries should be bound by the contents in paragraph 3 of the draft

letter X1. Further, this Court makes an observation that the Secretary to the Ministry of

Wildlife & Forest Resources Conservation is ought to take immediate steps to issue a

formal communication particularly with the contents embodied in paragraph 3 of the said

draft letter, marked X1, and to communicate such directions to the Forest Conservator

General/ Provincial Land Commissioners/ Land Commissioners/ all District

Secretaries/ all Divisional Secretaires. The above observations are being made in the best

interest of justice and also for the benefit of present and future generations whose duty

should be to safeguard the invaluable forests in the country.

On a careful consideration of the whole matter, I have come to the conclusion based on

the special circumstances of this case that I should exercise my discretion to refuse the

application of the Petitioner subject to the above observations made by this Court.
