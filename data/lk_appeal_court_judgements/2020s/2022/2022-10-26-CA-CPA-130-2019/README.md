Order

The Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent [hereinafter referred to as the 1st Respondent]

in this appeal had entered into an agreement dated 03.06.2002 with the Liberty Plaza

Management Corporation to rent out C/E/4, a store room.

The 1st Respondent had been using the said store room until 2015, despite the

Management Corporation repeatedly informing the 1st Respondent to handover the

possession as they would not be extending the period of the agreement.

The said agreement had expired on 02.06.2003 and was not renewed. The 1st

Respondent had not handed over the possession of the premises in dispute but paid

rent up to year 2012 instead. Thereafter, the 1st Respondent had issued a cheque on

15.10.2015 for a sum of Rs. 58,350/- as payment of the rent and it had not been

accepted by the Management Corporation of Liberty Plaza.

Page 3 of 6

It was the contention of the 1st Respondent that he has been in possession of the said

store room until an incident occurred on 28.10.2015, where the Petitioner and the

Respondent-Respondent-Respondent [hereinafter referred to as the 2nd Respondent]

allegedly broke into the store room, removed his belongings worth Rs. 975,000/- and

changed the padlocks of the said store room disturbing the possession and causing a

breach of peace.

Regarding the allegations leveled against the Petitioner by the 1st Respondent, it was

submitted on behalf of the Petitioner that he was informed when he returned to office

on 25.09.2015 that an inspection of the entire Liberty Plaza premises would be carried

out with the participation of security officers of the building. As per this inspection, it

had been observed that a room or space in the ground floor was open and in it were

only debris of other shops. There had been pieces of glass and wood, aluminum strips

and other shards. Since such an open space would raise security concerns and could be

used for social vices, the outer area of the room was cleared and afterwards this room

had been closed and padlocked by the security officers. The space in question C/E/4

was not used either by the 1st Respondent or the Liberty Plaza Management Corporation

as it is a common area although Liberty Plaza Management Corporation has the legal

ownership. However, it was revealed that the Management Corporation had leased out

the storeroom in the common area to the 1st Respondent.

Petitioner further states, neither this particular incident nor any subsequent

occurrence caused a breach of peace in any manner, or cause any threat to the breach

of peace. However, as per the Petitioner, the 1st Respondent had then made a

misrepresentation of facts to the police and lodged a false complaint alleging that the

storage space had been broken into and that goods worth Rs. 975,000/- which were

supposedly there were stolen. However, even the debris and goods that were cleared

from the said space have been handed over to the police along with the key to the

padlock.

The learned High Court Judge had observed that the 1st Respondent had made a

complaint to the Police Station of Colpetty on 28.10.2015 stating that the Petitioner

and the 2nd Respondent unlawfully and forcefully broke into the said premises and

removed goods worth Rs. 975,000/- and acquired possession of the said premises.

.

Furthermore, the Police had reported facts to the Magistrate under B 3379/15, inter

alia;

[1st Respondent]

.

.

After 21 days from the said complaint, the Police informed Court that certain stolen

goods were recovered but in the B report it was mentioned that none of the goods

were taken into custody. Although it was alleged that the 1st Respondent had made a

misrepresentation of facts to the Police and lodged a false complaint, Petitioner had

not substantiated the said contention.

It was revealed that the Police had investigated the complaint made by the 1st

Respondent regarding theft of articles and had reported facts to the Magistrate of Fort

in B 3379/15. Thus, it clearly shows that there was a breach of peace threatened or

likely to be threatened owing to the dispute between the Petitioner and the 1st

Respondent.

Moreover, the learned Magistrate had entertained the information filed under Section

66(1) (b) being satisfied that there was a breach of peace or a likelihood of such breach

as established by the 1st Respondent.

In these circumstances, it is observable that the main issue to be determined in this

matter in terms of Section 68(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act is as to who was

is possession of the disputed premises on the date on which information was filed under

Section 66(1) (b) of the Act. However, when there is an allegation of forcible

dispossession, the Court can act under Section 68(3) and make a determination as to

whether such dispossession has been affected within two months prior to the filing of

the information.

It was the contention of the 1st Respondent that the Petitioners claim is entirely based

on forcible dispossession. Thus, in such circumstances, Section 68(3) of the Act applies

Page 5 of 6

and as such, the learned Magistrate has quite correctly proceeded to inquire into

whether requisites of Section 68(3) have been met.

The learned Magistrate has stated in the Order dated 18.03.2016:

. 6 2011 2012

.

It appears that after the termination of the agreement 1, the Liberty Plaza

Management Corporation had accepted rent from the 1st Respondent and 1st

Respondent had paid rent by 4, 5 and 6. However, they were not made as

monthly payments but for a period of two months by 4 and for a period of 10 months

by 5 and 6.

58,350/-

.

The learned Magistrate had concluded stating that a cheque for Rs. 58,350/- sent to

the Petitioner does not prove that the 1st Respondent had been in possession of the

disputed premises in question. However, in view of the evidence placed before the

Magistrate, the learned High Court Judge had come to the conclusion that the 1st

Page 6 of 6

Respondent had established his possession to the disputed premises until 01.05.2013

since the 1st Respondent paid rent for 2012 May2013 April by P5.

The Court observes that the 1st Respondent had sent a cheque for Rs. 58,350/-. Thus,

it is reasonable to presume that the 1st Respondent was in possession of the disputed

premises when taking into consideration why the 1st Respondent had paid rent to the

Petitioner.

The complaint made to Police by the 1st Respondent stated;

.

This establishes the possession of the 1st Respondent to the disputed premises.

Since the disputed premises was used for the purpose of storage facility, it was

revealed by evidence placed before the Magistrate that the 1st Respondent was in

possession of the disputed premises two months prior to the filing of the information

and that he was dispossessed from the premises in question.

Therefore, I hold that the Order of the Magistrate is erroneous. However, the learned

High Court Judge had come to the correct findings of fact and law. Hence, the Order

to have the 1st Respondent restored to possession of the disputed premises is well

founded.

Thus, we set aside the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 18.03.2016 and affirm

the Order of the learned High Court Judge dated 10.10.2019 and dismiss the application

of the Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner with cost fixed at Rs. 30,000/-.
