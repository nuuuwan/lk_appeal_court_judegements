Written Submissions: Petitioner -04.10.2022 1st to 9th Respondents -31.08.2022 10th Respondent -02.09.2022 Decided on : 29.11.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner and the 10th Respondent are currently serving at the 1st Respondent Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation (Corporation) in the posts of Manager-Human Resources

Development-Grade A-3 (Manager HR-DEV) and Manager-Human Resources-Grade

A-3 (Manager HR) respectively. The Petitioner in this application is seeking for writs of

Certiorari and writs of Mandamus.

The marks allocated for the 10th Respondent at the interview held on 30.11.2021 to

promote a suitable candidate for the post of Manager HR are sought to be quashed by way

of a writ of Certiorari. Even the decision of the relevant interview panel and the decision

of the 2nd to 8th Respondents, who are the members of the Board of Directors of the

Corporation, to recommend and appoint the 10th Respondent to the said post of Manager

HR are also being challenged by the Petitioner.

Similarly, the Petitioner seeks for a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus directing

the members of the interview panel (sat on 30.11.2021) to allocate marks in favour of the

Petitioner and also to appoint the Petitioner to the post of Manager HR.

The Petitioner whilst serving as a Deputy Manager-Human Resources of the Corporation

initially faced an interview conducted on 29.04.2021 to promote a suitable candidate to

the post of Manager HR-DEV. The Petitioner was the only successful candidate who

applied for the said post and she has accepted the said post with effect from 30.11.2021.

In view of the letter issued by the Managing Director of the Corporation on 05.01.2022

Page 4 of 7

(1R19), the Petitioner has been assigned to the said post as a promotion accorded to her

and the Petitioners original letter of appointment dated 15.03.2000 has also been amended

accordingly by the same document 1R19. This clearly implies that the appointment to

the post of Manager HR-DEV is solely a promotion accorded to the Petitioner.

After the Petitioner facing the said interview on 29.04.2021, she has faced another

interview on 30.11.2021 conducted to promote a candidate to the post of Manager HR.

The 10th Respondent who was an Assistant Manager-Human Resources has also faced the

same interview. In view of letter dated 05.01.2022 (1R15), the 10th Respondent has been

assigned to the said post and that was also clearly a promotion accorded to the 10th

Respondent. It is noted that the Petitioner was assigned to the post of Manager HR-DEV

by way of 1R19 issued on the same day, i.e., 05.01.2022 based on the merits gained by

her at the interview on 29.04.2021.

The alleged grievance of the Petitioner is that the she has not been given marks at the

interview held on 30.11.2021 and further, the 10th Respondent has no required

qualifications to be appointed as the Manager HR. The primary question which needs

consideration by this Court is whether the Petitioner can demand that she be promoted to

the post of Manager HR in the given instance where she has been promoted to the post of

Manager HR-DEV following an interview held prior to the date of the second interview.

I must draw my attention to the Procedural Rules published by the Public Service

Commission in Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 1589/30 on 20.02.2009, although

such Rules have no direct application to the Corporation. In terms of the said Rules,

Promotion means the appointment in accordance with an approved service minute or a

scheme of recruitment, of an officer holding a post in the public service, to a post, class or

grade which is superior to the post he holds, or a class or a grade to which he belongs. The

term Appointment has been defined therein as the conferment of any paid office in the

public service subject to or not subject to subsequent confirmation, to a person not already

in the public service, or an appointment, or a promotion or transfer involving an increase

of salary or any change in status of a person already in public service. The material before

Court clearly reflects that the applicants have been called for relevant interviews by way

of internal notifications and as such both the above interviews (on 29.04.202 & 30.11.2021)

have been conducted not to appoint external candidates to such posts but to promote

officers internally to the posts of Manager HR and Manager HR-DEV.

Page 5 of 7

The fundamental question that arises here is whether an employee can pick and choose to

which post that he should be promoted especially when he applied for promotion to two

distinct posts during the same period. The effect of facing two different interviews pursuant

to two different posts for the purpose of promotion, in my view, is voluntarily ceasing the

choice between two posts and becoming incapacitated to demand for one particular post

of your choice. There is a tendency of this position being varied in an event where there is

an explicit precondition governing such situation. There can be occasions where an

applicant does not challenge a decision at the initial stages but waits until some

consequential or unfavourable decision is taken. In other words, such latter decision will

be challenged only after somebody else other than such applicant is benefited by such latter

decision. Thus, the conduct of the Petitioner should also be assessed in line with the above

findings.

I see no evidence of any declaration made by the Petitioner at the interview on 30.11.2021

that she would relinquish her rights in pursuant to the interview conducted in reference to

the post of Manager HR-DEV. It may be true that the authorities, after the related

interview, had not taken a decision in regard to the post of Manager HR-DEV even until

30.11.2021. The Respondents in this Application have taken effort to justify the delay in

announcing the outcome of the interview held on 29.04.2021. But no employee should get

an undue advantage of such situation, especially with regard to promotions in the service.

The Petitioner is now holding the post of Manager HR-DEV and no attempt has been

made voluntarily by her to get her existing promotion invalidated. Then what is the

rationale for her to raise a claim that she should be promoted to the post of Manager HR

instead of the 10th Respondent, even if it is assumed that non allocation of marks at the

interview on 30.11.2021 is irrational?

Irrelevant considerations may also be innocuous if the action taken is reasonable in itself,

in fixing the level of pay of its employees, which is required by the court to be reasonable,

a local authority may act on entirely wrong ground and yet its payments, if not in

themselves excessive, are not unlawful (Vide-Administrative Law by H. W. R. Wade

and C. F. Forsyth (11th Edition) Oxford at p. 329).

Furthermore, the aforesaid notion of voluntary ceasing of the choice which emerges as a

result of applying to two distinctive posts at the time of promotions, should be properly

assessed along with the substantive prejudice that can be presumably caused to the

Page 6 of 7

Petitioner. In this regard attention should be drawn to the purported damage that can be

caused to the Petitioner by promoting the 10th Respondent to the post of Manager HR;

and the purported damage that can be caused to the 10th Respondent in an event of her

being taken away from the post of Manager HR, based on all the circumstances of this

case. The 1st to 9th Respondents contend that the two posts are comparable in status as well

as in remuneration and further, the 10th Respondent cannot gain anything more than the

Petitioners entitlements in the new post. This position is clearly evinced in the Salary

Conversion Forms 1R9 and 1R10. Additionally, the attention of Court was drawn to

the fact that a sum of Rs.105,000.00 had been paid by the Corporation, in view of the

document marked 1R8, enabling the Petitioner to follow one-year National Diploma in

Training and HR Development Course which commenced in January 2021.

On a careful perusal of the internal advertisements calling for applications for both above

posts imply that the applicants should at least be in the service of Grade A-5, a requirement

set down even in the Scheme of Recruitment approved by the Board in 1991 (1R13).

Even the Department of Management Services has observed that no Scheme of

Recruitment is in existence other than for the posts in the category of Grade A. It is obvious

that the draft Scheme of Recruitment, marked P13, cannot be officially adopted as it has

not yet been approved by the Department of Management Services, although the

Petitioner takes a different view on the point. The contention of the Respondents is that

the administrative practice of not allocating marks at an interview in an event where the

respective candidate has previously applied (or has been assigned) for a promotion in

respect of another post has existed for a considerable period of time at the Corporation.

In R vs. Broadcasting Complaints Commission ex parte Owen (1985) 2 All ER 522 (at

p.523), the Court has held that;

When the reason given by a statutory body for taking or not taking a particular course of

action were not mixed and could be clearly disentangled and where the court was satisfied

that even though one reason might be bad in law the statutory body would nevertheless have

reached precisely the same decision for the remaining, valid reasons, the court would not

interfere by way of judicial review.

I am convinced, based on the material submitted to Court that the 10th Respondent has

reasonably fulfilled the required criteria to be appointed to the post of Manager HR in

terms of the aforesaid Scheme of Recruitment adopted in 1991. In these circumstances and

Page 7 of 7

on the above grounds, I take the view that no adequate material has been placed before

Court in order to arrive at a conclusion that the decision of the interview panel not to

allocate marks to the Petitioner on 30.11.2021 is ex facie illegal or ultra vires.

In passing, I comment that the upper Management of the Corporation is ought to consider

many facets in due administration within the institution and also serious attention should

be drawn to the past record of an officer in addition to the qualifications when appointing

an officer to an important and responsible post such as Manager Human Resources. The

1st to 9th Respondents tendering letters, marked 1R1 to 1R6, alleged that the Petitioner

had been warned and issued letters pertaining to at least six incidents of violation of the

disciplinary provisions and disrupting service while she was serving in the Human

Resources sector. The Management should be able to use their discretion to a greater

extent but, according to law, especially when making appointments to senior posts in the

Human Resources sector which has a direct link to leave, promotions, overtime work,

transfer etc. of the employees. Anyhow, based on the above findings, I am not inclined to

examine such issues as well as the preliminary objections raised by the Respondents.

In the circumstances, I hold that the decisions of the 1st to 9th Respondents not to allocate

marks to the Petitioner at the interview conducted on 30.11.2021 and to promote the 10th

Respondent to the post of Manager HR are not illegal and ultra-vies as claimed by the

Petitioner. Thus, the Petitioner is not entitled to any of the reliefs prayed for in the prayer

of the Petition.

Application is dismissed.
