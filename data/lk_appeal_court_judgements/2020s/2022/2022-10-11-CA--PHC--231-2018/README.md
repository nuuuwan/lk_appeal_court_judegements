This is an appeal against the order dated 28.08.2018, delivered by the Provincial

High Court of the Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Ratnapura, which acted in

revision and affirmed the vehicle confiscation order of the learned Magistrate of

Balangoda dated 21.01.2014, under the Forest Ordinance. The claimant-

petitioner-appellant (hereinafter the appellant) has preferred the instant appeal to

this Court in order to have both the orders set aside, and thereby disallow the

confiscation of the vehicle bearing vehicle registration no. SG HW-4610.

PHC-231/2018 Page 4 of 8 11/10/2022 IJ-41-22

The facts of the case are briefly as follows. The accused-defendant (hereinafter

the accused) was charged in the Magistrate Court of Balangoda for the

transportation of Timber (Teak) without a valid permit, and thereby acting in

contravention of the law set out in the Forest Ordinance, as amended by

Amendment Act, No. 65 of 2009 (hereinafter Act), under Section 25(2) read with

Section 40 of the Act.

The Magistrate Court of Balangoda framed charges against the accused on

31.01.2012. The accused pleaded guilty and upon conviction, the learned

Magistrate imposed a fine of Rs 7500/= on the accused. An inquiry was held by

the learned Magistrate to show cause as to why the vehicle in question should

not be confiscated, pursuant to which the appellant (the registered owner of the

vehicle) and a witness named Hettiarachchilage Chaminda Dassanayake, gave

evidence. After the conclusion of the evidence, the learned Magistrate ordered the

vehicle to be confiscated for want of precautionary measures on the part of the

registered owner of the vehicle, as the burden of proof was not discharged to the

satisfaction of the Court, as per the law set out in the Act.

Aggrieved by the said decision, the appellant filed a revision application in the

High Court of Ratnapura, which reaffirmed the order of the learned Magistrate.

Hence the appellant has preferred the instant appeal to the Court of Appeal to

set aside the order dated 21.01.2014, delivered by the Magistrate Court and the

subsequent order dated 28.08.2018 delivered by the High Court.

Before embarking upon the merits, the law pertinent to the application merits

being reproduced in the following manner:

40(1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence

(a) all timber or forest produce which is not the property of the

State in respect of which such offence has been committed;

and

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in

committing such offence,

PHC-231/2018 Page 5 of 8 11/10/2022 IJ-41-22

shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such

offence, be confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools,

vehicles, implements and machines used in the commission of

such offence, is a third party, no Order of Confiscation shall

be made if such owner proves to the satisfaction of the Court

that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of such

tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines, as the case

may be, for the commission of the offence. (Emphasis added)

Accordingly, the legislation on forest conservation has cast an

indispensable burden on the third party to an offence coming within the

purview of Section 40 of the Ordinance, to dispense the burden of proving

to the satisfaction of the court that he/she, as the owner of the vehicle in

dispute, has taken necessary precautionary measures to preclude the

vehicle from being employed in acts of crime. Therefore, this Court will

primarily look into the contention whether the learned Magistrate has

correctly applied the relevant legal provisions and evaluated the evidence

presented before the court, in arriving at the final determination that the

appellant has failed to dispense the said burden.

The learned Magistrate in delivering his order has examined the evidence

submitted by the appellant and the witness, to arrive at the decision that

there are discrepancies between the evidence submitted by the said

parties, due to which the required burden has not been discharged to the

satisfaction of the Court.

The cross-examination conducted on the witness during the inquiry

revealed that the vehicle has been in the control and possession of the

witness. According to the witness, by way of a verbal contract between the

appellant and the witness, the appellant has ceded control of the vehicle

in question to the witness, upon him paying an amount of Rs. 825 000 to

the appellant. The appellant has also intimated that its legal ownership

PHC-231/2018 Page 6 of 8 11/10/2022 IJ-41-22

will be transferred to the witness in the future. An amount of Rs. 800 000

has so far been paid by the witness to the appellant. Further, the witness

claimed that he hired the accused as the driver for the vehicle in dispute,

thus asserting that he wielded actual control of the vehicle.

However, the appellant, despite the transfer of possession of the vehicle to

the witness, continued as the registered owner of the vehicle. He claimed

that he was in control of the vehicle and that it was him who hired the

accused to drive the vehicle. Thus, the Magistrate Court and the High

Court have not taken into consideration, the averments of the appellant

because of the above adduced contradictory evidence by the appellant and

the witness.

Nonetheless, this Court further observes that, the appellant during the

cross-examination has admitted in the Magistrate Court that the sale of

his vehicle to the witness transpired after the said offence has been

committed by the accused (Page 102 of the Appeal Brief), which further

contradicts the evidence submitted by the witness with regards to his

control over the vehicle during the commission of the offence by the

accused.

Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that given the discrepancies in the

evidence submitted by the witness and the appellant, the averment of the

appellant that he took all necessary precautions to prevent the occurrence

of a crime cannot be accepted. The disparity in the claims of the appellant

and the witness, taints the appellants contention that he took

precautionary measures to prevent the vehicle from being employed in acts

contravening the law. Thus, it is not clear to this Court as to who wielded

control over the vehicle between the witness and the appellant.

The appellant as the documented registered owner, averred that he neither

had any knowledge of the diversion of the vehicle nor of the offence

committed, which does not suffice to dispense the burden cast on him by

the Act, to establish to the satisfaction of the court that he had taken

PHC-231/2018 Page 7 of 8 11/10/2022 IJ-41-22

necessary precautionary measures to avert the offence committed by the

accused. As held in S. D. N. Premasiri v Officer in Charge,

Mawathagama C A (PHC) 46/2015 Court of Appeal Minute dated

27.11.2018 it is imperative to prove to the satisfaction of Court that the

vehicle owner in question has not only given instructions but also has taken

every possible step to implement them

In Jalathge Surasena v Officer in Charge, Police Station of Hikkaduwa

CA (PHC) APN 100/2014, Minute dated 30.06.2015, it was held that a

mere denial of not having knowledge of the offence committed is not

sufficient to discharge the burden cast on a registered owner of a vehicle.

In the instant application, neither the appellant (the registered owner of

the vehicle) nor the witness (current owner of the vehicle) have shown

cause so as to satisfy the Court that either one of them has taken the

necessary precautionary measures to prevent the offence, thereby

discharging the burden cast on them, on a balance of probability. Hence,

the appellants contention that he had no knowledge of the offence being

committed itself brings to light the lax precautions taken by the registered

owner, and further affirms the fact that he has not taken satisfactory

precautions to prevent the vehicle from being employed in acts of crime,

as a responsible owner of a vehicle.

With the implementation of the Amendment Act, No. 65 of 2009, a higher

degree of burden of proof is set upon the owner of the vehicle. As per the

law set out in the amended Section 40 of the Act, the owner of a vehicle

must prove on a balance of probability that he has taken every possible

precautionary measure to prevent such an offence being committed.

Merely giving instructions or claiming lack of knowledge of the diversion

of the vehicle does not suffice to discharge the burden placed upon an

owner by this amendment.

Therefore, owing to the failure of either party to prove on a balance of

probability, the prevalence of precautionary measures taken by them, to

the satisfaction of this Court, and the failure to dispense the burden cast

PHC-231/2018 Page 8 of 8 11/10/2022 IJ-41-22

on the owner of a vehicle, this Court is of the view that there is no

irregularity or illegality in the order delivered by the learned Magistrate.

The learned High Court Judge has correctly dismissed the revision

application. Accordingly, we see no reason to interfere with the order of

the learned High Court Judge dated 28.08.2018 and the confiscation order

of the learned Magistrate dated 21.01.2014.

The appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
