Judgment

It appears that the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant, Palliyaguruge Wickramapala

has preferred this appeal seeking to revise the Order of the learned High Court Judge

of Ratnapura made in respect of the Order delivered by the learned Magistrate of

Page 4 of 6

Ratnapura acting as the Primary Court Judge exercising jurisdiction in terms of

Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 in case bearing No.

92956.

Apparently, the Petitioner Hettithanthrige Shiromani Bernadetta Fernando had filed

an information under Section 66 (1) (b) of the said Act, claiming that the 1st

Respondent and the 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Respondent [hereinafter referred

to as the 4th Respondent] had forcibly commenced putting up a structure in premises

belonging to her at No. 140, Pothgul Vihara Road, Ratnapura.

It was the contention of the Petitioner and the Respondents that they have been in

possession of the disputed premises for a period of well over 30 years until the 1st

and 2nd Respondents forcibly entered the land in dispute and attempted to put up a

boutique. Thereby, they were disturbed and dispossessed from the disputed

premises.

Although, the 3rd and 4th Intervenient Respondents had intervened during the

pendency of the case and claimed that they are entitled to the possession of the

premises, nevertheless, they did not pursue their claims seeking to set aside the

Order of the learned Magistrate dismissing their claim.

By Order dated 25.08.2014, the learned Magistrate allowed the application of the

said Petitioner holding that she is entitled to the possession of the disputed premises

and restored the possession of the Petitioner.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned Magistrate, the 1st Respondent-

Petitioner Palliyaguruge Wickramapala moved in revision to the High Court of

Ratnapura and the learned High Court Judge of Ratnapura had dismissed the

application of the Petitioner on the ground that the Petitioner had not disclosed any

question of law or facts. Thereafter, the Petitioner preferred an appeal to this Court

seeking to revise or set aside the Order of dismissal by the learned High Court Judge

dated 05.05.2016 and the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 25.08.2014.

It was alleged by the said 1st Respondent-Petitioner that the learned High Court

Judge had not analysed the evidence or given any reasons for his decision.

However, it is seen that the learned High Court Judge had stated in his Order that

he has considered the revision application filed by the Petitioner and the objections

of the Respondents with the other relevant points/important matters and also the

written submission tendered by both parties.

It was further stated by the learned High Court Judge in his Order that the learned

Additional Magistrate of Ratnapura had come to the correct findings of fact and law

and has held that the impugned dispute comes within the purview of Section 68 of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

It is relevant to note that the learned High Court Judge stated in his Order that;

....

In view of the findings of the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge,

we see no reason to interfere with the Orders of the learned High Court Judge of

Ratnapura dated 05.05.2016 and the learned Magistrate of Ratnapura dated

25.08.2014 in which it was decided that the Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent in

this appeal is entitled to the possession of the land in dispute and restored the

possession of the same.

Hence, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
