Judgment

Officer-in-Charge of Minor Offences Branch at Police Station-Ratnapura being the Complainant

had filed an information under Section 66 (1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979

in the Additional Magistrates Court of Ratnapura in case bearing No. 62209. It was informed that

there is a dispute between the 1st Party-Respondent and the 2nd Party-Respondent regarding a

pathway and of an imminent danger of a breach of peace.

The said 1st Party-Respondent and the 2nd Party-Respondent appeared in Court and filed their

respective affidavits and counter affidavits with documents. Thereafter, the learned Magistrate

acting as the Primary Court Judge delivered the order on 29.06.2009 which held that the 2nd Party-

Respondent is entitled to use the disputed pathway as a foot path.

Subsequently, the Counsel for the 1st Party-Respondent, by way of a motion prayed that the order

of the learned Primary Court Judge be enforced through the Fiscal Officer and accordingly, the

Court made an order to handover the possession of the disputed pathway as per the journal entry

dated 16.07.2009.

.

On 31.07.2004, the Fiscal Officer of the Magistrates Court of Ratnapura had gone to handover

the possession of the disputed pathway. At that time the 1st Party-Respondent had pointed out a

pathway to the right-hand side of the boutique which belonged to one Dayawansha.

However, the 2nd Party-Respondent had informed the Fiscal Officer that it is not the pathway which

she claimed and the pathway which she claimed is on the left side of the boutique of Dayawansha

and not on the right-hand side.

Apparently, the Fiscal Officer had pointed out to 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant, the

pathway referred to in the schedule to the order of the learned Primary Court Judge dated

29.06.2009 and had further advised the 2nd Party-Respondent to comply with such order or

otherwise to inform facts to Court to obtain relief.

However, on 27.08.2009, the learned Primary Court Judge identified the subject matter of the case

through the investigation notes and the sketch filed by the Police and the report of the Grama

Niladhari. Thereafter, the learned Primary Court Judge had ordered the possession of the disputed

pathway to be handed over to the 2nd Party-Respondent.

In compliance with the said order dated 16.07.2009 [

], the 2nd Party-Respondent had filed license papers [ ] through a motion on

02.02.2010 and had claimed the possession of the pathway as per the final order of the learned

Primary Court Judge dated 29.06.2009.

The Fiscal Officer of the Ratnapura Magistrates Court had gone to the disputed pathway on

18.01.2011 and had reported to Court that he was unable to handover the possession of the pathway

to the 2nd Party-Respondent since he could not identify the disputed roadway.

Thereafter, Counsel for the 2nd Party-Respondent had filed a motion dated 10.01.2011 and had

informed Court about the facts relating to the handing over of the possession of the disputed

Page 5 of 11

pathway. Consequently, the learned Primary Court Judge made an order on 19.05.2011, and held

that it has to be decided whether the possession of the disputed pathway is to be handed over

according to his predecessors order or not and thereafter had ordered to comply with his

predecessors order.

Being aggrieved by the orders made by the learned Primary Court Judge on 16.07.2009, the 2nd

Party-Petitioner had preferred an application for revision to the Provincial High Court of Ratnapura

in case bearing No. RA/108/11. Apparently, the learned High Court Judge dismissed the said

application of the 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner on the grounds that, there were no exceptional

circumstances pleaded by the2nd Party-Petitioner-Respondent and that there is an inordinate delay

in exercising the discretionary remedy of revision by the Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned High Court Judge of Ratnapura dated 13.06.2011,

the 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant had preferred an Appeal seeking to set aside the

said Order of the learned High Court Judge and also sought reliefs prayed in the prayer to the

petition of the said revision application.

It was submitted on behalf of the 2nd Party-Petitioner-Appellant [hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the Appellant] that the learned High Court Judge has failed to address his mind to the following

exceptional circumstances exist to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court.

a) That the disputed pathway has not been subjected to proper identification owing to the

failure of learned Primary Court Judge of Ratnapura to conduct a scene inspection.

b) That the 3rd Party (Respondent-Respondent) has been adversely affected by the Order of

the learned Primary Court Judge of Ratnapura, which has negated the prime purpose behind

applications under Section 66 under Primary Courts Procedure Act.

Furthermore, it was submitted that the learned High Court Judge has erred in dismissing the

revision application of the 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant when the same was filed

within a reasonable period of time.

Page 6 of 11

According to the journal entries, although the main order was delivered on 05.03.2014, the 2nd

Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant could not execute the Writ of Possession for various

reasons. The learned Primary Court Judge had made an order on 13.06.2011 with regard to the

execution of Writ of Possession. Since the 2nd Party - Petitioner- Appellant has invoked the

Revisionary Jurisdiction on 02.12.2011, the Appellant is not guilty of laches. Hence, the delay is

not a ground for the learned High Court Judge to dismiss the revision application of the Petitioner.

Importantly, the main objectives behind Section 66 applications under Primary Courts Procedure

Act are to prevent a breach of the peace, preserve the peace and also to maintain the status quo

until the rights of parties are determined by a competent Civil Court.

The learned Primary Court Judge has specifically mentioned that he identified the disputed

pathway through the observation notes made by the Investigating Officer of Police Station

Ratnapura and report of the Grama Niladhari.

It is worthy to note that the learned Primary Court Judge has complied with Section 66(4) of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act by making an order to affix notice on the pathway under dispute

on 22.09.2008 and the Fiscal Officer of the Magistrates Court of Ratnapura has affixed such notice

on the disputed pathway. It was reported to Court on 06.10.2008. In this instance, Court draws the

attention to the Investigating Officers notes and observations pertaining to the disputed pathway

made by the Police Officer.

According to the said observations and the sketch of the Police, it is seen that the Investigating

Officer has recognized the disputed area on the right side of the house of the 1st Party-Respondent,

and a pathway adjacent to a boutique of one Dayawansha. Furthermore, it is seen that there is a

road way which leads to the houses on the right side of the boutique of the said Dayawansha.

The observations made by the learned Primary Court Judge in this respect should be noted;

.. ,

,

..

.

The Primary Court Judge has observed that in the affidavit of the 2nd Party-Respondent in which

it was stated that; the 1st Party-Respondent attempted to fence the disputed pathway and erect

concrete pillars to block the same.

It is pertinent to note that the Police Officer has marked the disputed pathway as F, in his

observation notes, and it is referred to in the schedule to the license papers [ ] as follows;

...............................................................................................................

............................ 20/1 -,

132 7.2

Page 8 of 11

............

It is relevant to note the observations made by the learned Primary Court Judge in this respect;

,

.

Considering the observation notes and the sketch submitted by the Informant P.C. 64096 Gnana

Keerthi of the Police Station-Ratnapura, it clearly states that;

.

,

.

According to the said sketch, it clearly shows that the disputed pathway is on the right side of the

1st Party-Respondent-Respondent-Respondents [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st Party-

Respondent] premises. However, the sketch does not show the boutique of Dayawansha.

According to the 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant, she got rights to use the disputed

pathway adjacent to Dayawanshas boutique. Since the 1st Party-Respondent had shown the

disputed roadway to the right side of Dayawanshas boutique, Court therefore has to determine

whether the disputed pathway is on the left side of Dayawanshas boutique or on the right side.

It was the position taken up by the 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant that the pathway

shown to the Fiscal Officer by the 1st Party-Respondent is a part of the land that belongs to one

Page 9 of 11

Ajith Hapuarachchi, who was not a party to the said Primary Court case. The 2nd Party-

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant contended that she did not claim the right of way to the said path

that belongs to the Respondent-Respondent namely the said Ajith Hapuarachchi and that the

dispute between the 1st Party-Respondent and 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant was only

regarding the pathway claimed and shown to the Fiscal by the 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant.

It appears that on 27.08.2009, the 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant and the said

Respondent-Respondent namely Ajith Hapuarachchi filed a motion and had informed the Primary

Court Judge that the disputed pathway has not been properly identified. It was further brought to

the notice of Court, that the notice under Section 66 (4) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act has

not been affixed on the pathway shown by the Fiscal Officer on the right side of the boutique of

Dayawansha and it had instead been affixed on the pathway claimed by the 2nd Party-Respondent

on the left side of the boutique.

It was further brought to the notice of Court that the pathway shown by the Fiscal Officer through

a building, belonged to the Respondent-Respondent and that there is a pending case for the said

land in the District Court of Ratnapura in case bearing No. 22960.

Therefore, it is clear that the disputed pathway is on the left side of the said Dayawanshas

boutique. This Court observes that, although the Investigation Officer had mentioned about

Dayawanshas boutique and the disputed pathway in observation notes, he had not shown

Dayawanshas boutique in the sketch and had shown the disputed area as (F), which seems a fatal

irregularity. Thus, the Investigating Officer had not performed his duty with due diligence, which

caused an injustice to the Appellant.

According to the investigation notes, it is observable that there is a pathway leading to the 2nd

Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellants house, adjacent to the boutique of the said Dayawansha.

The learned Primary Court Judge declared that the Appellant is entitled to use the disputed

pathway. However, has confusingly stated:

Page 10 of 11

.

In this instance, Court observes that although the learned Primary Court Judge held against the 1st

Party-Respondent, he had taken steps to execute the writ of Possession and had shown a pathway

on the right side of the boutique of Dayawansha to the fiscal. Perhaps, the learned Primary Court

Judge got confused and had inadvertently referred to the right side of Dayawanshas boutique,

instead of the left side of the boutique. As such, I hold that the disputed roadway is on the left side

of the said Dayawanshas boutique. Thus, it is corrected in the order dated 29.06.2009 by the

learned Primary Court Judge in terms of Section 78 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act read

with Section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code.

However, it clearly manifests that on several occasions, the 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant had moved to take possession of the disputed pathway. Regardless of it, she was not

allowed by the Court Officers to execute the Writ in order to obtain possession, despite the Order

made by the learned Primary Court Judge in favour of the Appellant. Without a doubt, it seems

that Court is at fault by not allowing the 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant to reap the

fruits of her victory. According to the legal maxim Actus curiae neminem gravabit, No one

should be prejudiced by an act of Court. Therefore, it is evident that great injustice has been

caused to the 2nd Party-Respondent- Petitioner-Appellant by an act of Court, which amounts to a

miscarriage of Justice. As such, exceptional circumstances exist for the 2nd Party-Respondent-

Appellant to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the provincial high Court of Ratnapura.

Therefore, in the light of the aforesaid reasons, it clearly manifests that the learned High Court

Judge has not considered the entitlement of the Appellant, thereby has erred in Law by dismissing

the application of the Appellant.

Hence, we set aside the Order of the learned High Court Judge dated 05.03.2014 and grant reliefs

prayed in the prayer of the petition dated 02.02.2011 invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of the

High Court.

Page 11 of 11

Thus, we set aside the Order dated 16.07.2009 by the learned Primary Court Judge and the Orders

made by the Primary Court thereafter.

For the foregoing reasons, we direct the incumbent Magistrate of the Magistrates Court of

Ratnapura to act as a Primary Court Judge and inspect the premises in order to identify the disputed

pathway and finally, to handover the possession of the same to the 2nd Party-Respondent-

Petitioner-Appellant.

Hence, we allow this appeal. No cost is awarded in this appeal.
