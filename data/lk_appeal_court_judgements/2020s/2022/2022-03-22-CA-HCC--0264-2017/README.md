JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted in the High Court of Panadura under Section 296 of

the Penal Code for committing the murder of Dona Sunethra Priyadharshani

Kodikara on or about 25th May 2010.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Panadura as the

Appellant had opted for a non-jury trial. After the conclusion of the

prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge had called for the defence

and the Appellant had made a dock statement and closed his case. After

considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High Court

Judge had convicted the Appellant under section 296 of Penal code and

sentenced him to death on 10/08/2017.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

3 | P a g e

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellant was connected via

Zoom from prison.

Background of the Case

According to the evidence led in the trial, the deceased was expecting to

marry the Appellant after a long-term love affair. Initially he was a Buddhist

Priest but had given up the robe some time before the incident.

According to PW2 the mother of the deceased, the deceased is an educated

woman and was working for Sri Lanka Telecom at the time of her demise.

Around 8.45 a.m. on the day of the incident i.e.,25/05/2010 she had told

her mother that she was going with her fianc to buy shoes for him for their

wedding. She had further said that her fianc had asked her to come to

Homagama and from there they were to travel together to Colombo. By this

time, they had already bought the wedding rings and prepared the wedding

dress. In the afternoon around 2.30 p.m. the Appellant had come home

crying and told the mother that the deceased was not to be found and

suggested that they go to the police and lodge a complaint. He also

speculated that the deceased may have been killed by someone. At that time,

she had sensed the odour of alcohol emanating from the Appellant. He had

left the place after worshiping the mother of the deceased.

In the evening of 25/05/2010 PW4 the police officer had received information

about an unidentified naked dead body of a woman which was floating in the

Nachchimale lake and he reached the place around 7.00 p.m. According to

him the water level was about 4 feet and the height of the deceased was 5

feet and 1 inch.

4 | P a g e

As nobody came forward to claim the dead body, the police sought the

assistance of the public by publishing the photograph of the deceased in the

newspaper. After about a month, on 24/06/2010 PW1 the brother of the

deceased had gone to the Kalubowila Hospital morgue and identified the

dead body of his sister.

On 28/10/2010 the Appellant was arrested and his statement was recorded.

Upon his statement and acting under Section 27(1) of the Evidence

Ordinance a pair of slippers, a blouse, a lady underwear, a brassiere which

were alleged to have been belonging to the deceased were recovered under a

bamboo bush close to the place where the body of the deceased was found.

When the defense was called the Appellant had made a brief dock statement.

In his dock statement he had denied having any relationship with the

deceased during the material time and any knowledge about the recovered

items upon his statement.

Following appeal grounds were advanced by the Appellant.

1. The Learned High Court Judge has wrongly concluded that the

items of circumstantial evidence sufficient to come to the

conclusion that the Appellant only had committed the murder.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has wrongly refused the dock

statement of the Appellant.

According to PW1 the brother of the deceased the deceased was having a

long-term affair with the Appellant. Initially the Appellant was a Buddhist

priest under the name of Ratnasiri Thero. After the disrobement he had

changed his name as Premila Saranga. Three years before this incident the

Appellant had gone to Korea at the eleventh hour before the wedding

arrangements at that time.

5 | P a g e

This time, for the deceaseds wedding this witness had paid the price for the

weddings rings of the couple through his credit card and also bought the

wedding attire for the couple.

As the deceased went missing after 25/05/2010, he had lodged a complaint

at Homagama Police Station and searched for the deceased. On 24/06/2010

he found his sisters dead body at the Kalubowila Hospital morgue.

A photo copy of a letter allegedly written by the deceased confirming the love

affair between the Appellant and the deceased was marked as P1. At that

time the Appellant was a Buddhist monk. Further he had identified the dress

of the deceased during the trial. A three-wheeler was bought by the deceased

for the Appellant and on 17/04/2010 the deceased had given a call to this

witness and told him that the Appellant had forcibly taken her to a jungle in

Ehaliyagoda area and stranded her.

During the cross examination certain omissions had been marked by the

defense in his evidence.

According to PW2 the mother of the deceased, prior to the date of incident

the Appellant had twice visited her house but on both days the deceased was

not at home. On the fateful day, the deceased had left the house saying that

she was going to Colombo to buy shoes for her fianc. She had also

mentioned to her that she was going to meet him at Homagama in the

morning. According to this witness the deceased had bought a van for the

Appellant in addition to a three-wheeler.

In the first appeal ground the Appellant contends that the Learned High

Court Judge has wrongly concluded that the items of circumstantial

6 | P a g e

evidence are sufficient to come to the conclusion that the Appellant only

committed the murder.

In the case of C.Chenga Reddy and others v. State of A.P.(1996) 10 SCC

193 the court held that:

In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the settled law is that the

circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is drawn should be

fully proved and such circumstances must be conclusive in nature.

Moreover, all the circumstances should be complete and there should be

no gap left in the chain of evidence. Further the proved circumstances

must be consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt of the accused and

totally inconsistent with his innocence.

In the case of McGreevy v. Director of Public Prosecution [1973] 1

W.L.R.276the court held that:

There is no requirement, in cases in which the prosecutions case is

based on circumstantial evidence that the judge direct the jury to acquit

unless they are sure of the facts proved are not only consistent with guilt

but also inconsistent with any other reasonable conclusion. The question

for the jury is whether the facts as they find them to be drive them to

the conclusion, so that they are sure, that the defendant is guilty.

In the case of Attorney General v. Potta Naufer & others [2007) 2 SLR 144

the court held that:

When relying on circumstantial evidence to establish the charge of

conspiracy to commit murder and the charge of murder, the proved items

of circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point

towards the only inference that the accused committed the offence.

7 | P a g e

In the case of Kusumadasa v. State [2011] 1 SLR 240 the court held that:

The prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused

had the opportunity of committing the offence. The accused can be found

guilty and only if the proved items of circumstantial evidence is

consistent with their guilt and inconsistent with their innocence.

In Premawansha v. Attorney General [2009] 2 SLR 205 the court held that:

In circumstantial evidence if an inference of guilt is to be drawn, such

an inference must be the one and only irresistible and inescapable

conclusion that the accused committed the offence.

In this case in order to find the Appellant guilty of the charge, all the

circumstances must point at the Appellant that he is the one who committed

the murder of the deceased and not anybody else. It is the incumbent duty

of the prosecution to prove the same beyond reasonable doubt.

In this case according to PW01 and PW2, the Appellant is the person who

had an affair with the deceased. This was a long-term affair and according

to the witnesses the affair had been in existence since the Appellant was a

Buddhist monk. The witnesses clearly mentioned the name of the Appellant

before and after his priesthood when they gave evidence. Therefore, not

mentioning the name of the Appellant to police will not affect the prosecution

case, as the Appellant had admitted in his dock statement that he had an

affair with the deceased.

On the day of the incident the deceased had told PW2 that she was going to

meet the person whom she was going to marry. She did not tell her mother

the name of the person. The counsel for the Appellant argues that not

mentioning the name of the Appellant clearly manifests the fact that the

8 | P a g e

witness was not aware of the name of the Appellant at all material points.

But in the cross examination PW2 stated that she was well aware of the name

of the Appellant as the deceased had told her everything about her affair with

the Appellant. Further the Appellant had come to her house twice in the

absence of the deceased. She had also stated that as she was disturbed due

to the disappearance of the deceased, she could not mention all the details

in her statement to the police. Hence it is incorrect to say that she was

unaware of the Appellant. Hence the marked contradictions V1 and V2 will

not affect the root of the case.

The counsel for the Appellant contends that the utterance made by the

Appellant to PW2 creates a reasonable doubt as PW2 had not mentioned

about the utterance of the Appellant in her first statement to the police but

mentioned it for the first time in her 2nd statement which was made after

about five months of the incident. Further no explanation had offered for the

delay.

PW2 mother of the deceased in her evidence had stated that she was in a

state of shock when she gave her first statement to the police. She had given

all the details when she gave her statement after finding the dead body of the

deceased. Hence, the witness had given valid reasons for the delay in giving

a detailed statement.

In the case of Sumanasena V. Attorney General [1999] 3 SLR 137 it was

held that:

Just because the witness is belated witness ought not to reject his

testimony on that score alone, court must inquire into the reason for the

delay and if the reason for the delay is plausible and justifiable the court

could act on the evidence of a belated witness."

9 | P a g e

The Appellant in his dock statement did not deny that he had an affair with

the deceased. According to him the affair was not firm as they used to have

differences from time to time. On the day of the disappearance of the

deceased, the Appellant had gone to the deceaseds house weeping and told

PW2 that the deceased was not traceable and suggested they go to the police.

Before PW2 could speculate on anything, he had told PW2 that he suspect

that the deceased could have been murdered by somebody. Afterwards, the

Appellant had left the house after worshiping PW2. This suspicious conduct

of the Appellant as stated by the Learned High Court Judge in her judgment,

points the finger at none other than the Appellant. During this utterance,

PW2 was not as panicked as the Appellant but had assured him that the

deceased had gone to the office and will return later.

The previous and subsequent conduct of the Appellant also gives rise to a

reasonable suspicion about the Appellant. Now I consider whether the

previous and subsequent conduct of the Appellant are relevant to this case.

Section 8(1) and 8(2) of Evidence Ordinance are read as follows:

8 (1) Any fact is relevant which shows or constitute a motive or

preparation for any fact in issue or relevant fact.

8 (2) The conduct of any party, or of any agent to any party, to any suit

or proceedings in reference to such suit or proceedings or in reference

to any fact in issue therein or relevant thereto, and the conduct of any

person an offence against whom is the subject of any proceeding, if

such conduct influences or is influenced by any fact in issue or

relevant fact, and whether it was previous or subsequent thereto.

10 | P a g e

According to both PW1 and PW2 the Appellant had once abandoned the

deceased at Ehaliyagoda in the night. According to the witnesses the

Appellant had dragged the deceased to a forest area around 10.00 p.m. in

the night and abandoned her. This incident had happened on 17/04/2010

as the PW1 had received a call from the deceased that night. The deceased

had managed to come to a bicycle garage and called PW1.

On the date of the disappearance of the deceased the Appellant had come to

the deceaseds house around 2.30 p.m. weeping and informed the PW2 that

the deceased had gone missing and requested the PW2 to lodge a complaint

with the police. At that time without any basis, he speculated that the

deceased may have been killed by somebody. But the PW2 without panicking

asked from the Appellant as to why a police complaint was necessary. The

Appellant is not a frequent visitor to the deceaseds house. But he had come

to the deceaseds house on the day the deceased went out saying that she

was going to buy shoes for her fianc. Under these circumstances the

contradictions marked as V1 and V3 have no effect on the prosecution case.

A letter written by the deceased complaining about the Appellant when he

was under priesthood was marked as P1 by the prosecution. Even though

the Appellant argued that the said letter was marked subject to proof, on

perusal of the court record no such application was made by the defense

when P1 was marked. At page 59 of the brief the only application made by

the defence was to produce the original in court. In response to this

application no order was made by the court. Hence, it is incorrect to say that

P1 was marked subject to proof.

The Appellant argues that the bank cash deposit slips marked as P7(1), P7(2)

and P7(3) by the prosecution cannot be considered as proof for the existence

of a love affair between the deceased and the Appellant.

11 | P a g e

According to PW1 and PW2 all cash deposits, buying a three-wheeler and a

van were done in favour of the Appellant with the bona fide anticipation that

the Appellant would marry the deceased.

The letter P1 and the bank slips marked as P7(1), P7(2) and P7(3) even

though they are related to the case at hand do not go to the core of matter of

murder, the documents marked only resulted in the discovery of the

relationship but not the murder. The marking of the said documents

through the victims brother led to the discovery of the relationship between

the victim and the Appellant which is very well corroborated by PW1 and

PW2.

According to the evidence of PW4, the Chief Investigating Officer when he

visited the floating naked dead body of the deceased at Nachchimale, the

water level of the stream was about 4 feet deep and the height of the deceased

was 5 feet and 1 inch. According to PW3 JMO who conducted the post

mortem examination his findings were compatible with death due to

drowning.

The JMO elaborating further said that the internal organs test revealed that

the deceased was alive when she had fallen into the water. He further said

that if it was an accidental fall abrasion should be noted on the dead body.

Hence the possibility of an accidental fall was excluded by the doctor. He had

expressed an opinion that if someone forcibly dumped her into the water

death could have happened due to drowning.

In this case the deceased was fully naked when her body was fished out from

the stream. Considering her final utterance to her mother suicide cannot be

anticipated. But recovery of her clothes consequent to the Appellants

statement and the suspicious conduct of the Appellant it is very reasonable

12 | P a g e

that the trial judge had come to the conclusion that the Appellant is

responsible of the death of the deceased.

The Appellant further argues under the 1st ground of appeal that the evidence

regarding the recovery of deceaseds clothes after five months from the date

of offence near a bamboo bush close to the water stream is highly improbable

and unsafe to believe.

The Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance states that,

When any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of

information received from a person accused of any offence, in the

custody of a police officer, so much of such information, whether it

amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact thereby

discovered may be proved.

In Somaratne Rajapakse and Others v. Hon. Attorney General (2010) 2

Sri L.R. 113 at 115 it is stated that:

Vital importance of the scope of sec. 27 Evidence Ordnance is that only

the facts which are distinctly related to what has been discovered would

be permitted in evidence there should be a clear nexus between the

information given by the accused and the subsequent discovery of a

relevant fact. A discovery, made in terms of the Sec. 27 of Evidence

Ordinance discloses that the information given was true and that the

accused had knowledge of the existence and the whereabouts of the

actual discovery.

In this case the police had recovered the deceaseds clothes upon the

statement of the Appellant under Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

13 | P a g e

The investigating team recovered a trouser, a brassiere, a blouse, a pair of

slippers and an undergarment from under a bamboo bush.

The Appellant was arrested on 08/10/2010 at Gonapola close to Piliyandala

town. He was arrested at 5.10 p.m. His statement was recorded immediately

at Gonapola and recovered certain items pertaining to the crime. Answering

to the court PW4 had explained why he recorded the statement of the

Appellant immediately after the arrest. Vide page 139-140 of the brief. Hence

it is incorrect to say that the police had the prior knowledge about the clothes

of the deceased.

The Appellant further contends that as the recovery had been made after

about 05 months of the crime, and there is a reasonable doubt as to whether

the clothes which were uncovered, unprotected would have been there even

after 05 months.

The recovery was made after the arrest of the Appellant. If not for the arrest

of the Appellant the police could not have recovered anything related to the

crime. The truth regarding the dress of the deceased only surfaced upon the

statement he made to the police upon his arrest. Had the Appellant not

provided this information, the police could not have recovered these items.

Also contends that even though the recovery was made under a bamboo

bush, the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment had stated that the

recovery was made in the hollow of a tree. He further contends that due to

above misdirection the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider whether

it was probable to believe that the clothes were recovered even after 05

months.

14 | P a g e

PW4 in his evidence stated that the place of recovery was covered by trees

and the items were recovered from a place like a hollow covered by bamboo

trees. The Learned High Court Judge in her judgement mentioned this as

recovery was done in a hollow of a tree. She has only omitted to mention

about the bamboo tree. According to PW4 the place where the recovery was

made was only covered with bamboo. Hence, omitting to mention bamboo

tree in the judgment is not a serious misdirection as argued by the Appellant.

The Appellant further contends that despite the contradictions marked as

V4 and V5 the Learned High Court Judge wrongly concluded that the

Appellant is the person who hid the dress of the deceased.

PW2 in her first statement to police had said that the deceased wore a T-

shirt when she left the house on 25/05/2010. But in the court, she had

identified a red coloured blouse. Hence this contradiction was marked as V4

by the defence.

Further PW2 in her first statement to the police had said that the deceased

had worn green coloured slippers but when she gave evidence had said that

the deceased had worn white coloured slippers. This contradiction was

marked as V5 by the defence. Hence, the Appellant argues that the recovery

of productions upon the statement of the Appellant is doubtful.

PW2, the mother of the deceased is an elderly woman who had lost her

daughter. In her evidence she had said that she was greatly disturbed due

to her daughters demise. Further she had given evidence before the High

15 | P a g e

Court after nearly 10 years of the incident. Hence, it is not possible to

remember everything accurately as stated in the police statement.

In the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa

(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292 held that,

Witnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling discrepancies

and omissions. When contradictions are marked, the Judge should

direct his attention to whether they are material or not and the witness

should be given an opportunity of explaining the matter...The court

observed further, that human beings are not computers and that it

would be dangerous to disbelieve the witness and reject evidence based

on small contradictions or discrepancies.

Guided by the above-mentioned judgment, I conclude that the contradictions

marked as V4 and V5 by the defence are not contradictions which affect the

root of the case.

In the second ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the Learned High

Court Judge has wrongly refused the dock statement of the Appellant.

The Learned High Court Judge in her judgement at page 270-271 and 297

of the brief, had discussed the legal basis as to acceptance or rejection of a

dock statement. She not only considered the dock statement but had also

given reasons as to why she was rejecting the dock statement of the Appellant

and accepting the prosecution case. Hence it is incorrect to say that the

Learned High Court Judge had wrongly refused the dock statement. Hence

this appeal ground also has no merit.

16 | P a g e

As discussed under appeal ground one the prosecution had adduced strong

and incriminating circumstantial evidence against the Appellant. The

Learned High Court Judge had very correctly analyzed all the evidence

presented by both parties and come to the conclusion that all the

circumstances are consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the

Appellant and totally inconsistent with his innocence.

As the Learned High Court Judge had rightly convicted the Appellant for the

charge of murder, I affirm the conviction and dismiss the Appeal of the

Appellant.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court

of Panadura along with the original case record.
