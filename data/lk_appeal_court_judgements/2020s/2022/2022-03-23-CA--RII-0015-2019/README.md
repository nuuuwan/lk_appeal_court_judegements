Judgment

1.The plaintiff respondent in her written submissions has cited the case

Suneth Indika Nawagamuwa and others vs. Seylan Merchant Bank

Limited., C. A. Application for Restitutio in Integrum and Revision

15/2016 decided by Justice Janak De Silva in which His Lordship

citing cases Perera et al vs. Wijewickrema 15 NLR 411, Menchinahamy

2 | 1 5 2 0 1 9 R I I J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s ti c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

vs. Muniweera et al 52 NLR 409 and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation

Ltd. vs. Shanmugam and another 1995 01 SLR 55 has said,

"The remedy by way of restitutio in integrum is an extraordinary remedy

and is given under very exceptional circumstances and the power of the

court should be most cautiously and sparingly exercised".

His Lordship also said in that case citing Perera vs. People's Bank

(1995) 02 SLR 84 that,

"Revision is a discretionary remedy and the conduct of the defendant

is a matter which is intensely relevant".

02. The present application for Restitutio in Integrum and Revision was

made by the 01st defendant petitioner togetherwith an application

bearing No. 08/2019/TRF for the transfer of the case No. 523/SPL from

the district court of Kaduwela, on the basis of the alleged injudicious

behavior of the learned district judge with bias towards the

plaintiff, who herself is a judicial officer and on the basis that no fair

hearing will be served to the 01st defendant petitioner. But the

petitioner did not pursue with the application for the transfer of the

case, since the said learned district judge himself has been transferred

from the said district court.

03. Despite not being interested in the transfer application, the

petitioner supported the present application for Restitutio in Integrum

and for Revision, on the basis, that, orders dated 11.11.2019,

04.12.2019 and 10.12.2019, which the said last order was made after

the present application was made, are prejudicial to the petitioner.

3 | 1 5 2 0 1 9 R I I J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s ti c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

04. The 01st defendant petitioner has tendered a Second Amended

Petition dated 12.12.2019 on which presently reliance is made. There is

a preliminary objection by the plaintiff respondent, that, the said

second amended petition is not supported by way of an affidavit. But it

is clear that the original petition of the 01st defendant seeking

Restitutio in Integrum etc., was supported by a valid affidavit and hence

the jurisdiction of this court has been validly invoked.

05. The plaintiff, Tharanga Udayanganie Rajapakse is living in an

upstairs house situated about 500 meters from the land on which the

01st defendant, Regent Homes Pvt. Ltd., is constructing about 09

houses for sale. The 02nd defendant is Mrs. A. D. Y. Anandini, the

Divisional Secretary of Kaduwela Division who has granted the permit

Z.01 for the supply of electricity to the land of the 01st defendant

petitioner, through lines drawn along the Western Boundary of the

plaintiff's premises. It is admitted that these lines carry a voltage of

33,000. The 03rd defendant, Mr. K. M. Pradeep was the Electrical

Engineer whereas the 04th defendant is the Ceylon Electricity Board.

The 05th defendant is the Attorney General.

06. The petitioner places great reliance on the alleged fact that the

other defendants have accepted the position of the petitioner. In

fact, two tables giving paragraphs of the second amended petition

admitted by two sets of defendants has been attached to the written

submissions of the petitioner tendered after the oral hearing. It is

pertinent to note what the other defendants admit as well as deny

out of the averments made by the petitioner in its second amended

petition.

4 | 1 5 2 0 1 9 R I I J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s ti c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

07. The 02nd and 05th defendants have filed objections together while

the 03rd and 04th defendants have filed same objections. Apparently,

the objections have been drafted with the advice of the 05th defendant,

who appeared for all official defendants.

08. The 02,05 as well as 03,04 defendants deny paragraph 04 of the

second amended petition, however that is where the plaintiff's case has

been narrated.

09. In denying the averments the said official defendants state that they

do deny the said averments in the second amended petition in the

exact form they are pleaded at present.

10. Both sets of official defendants deny paragraph 27 of the second

amended petition which says,

"Thereafter the Learned District Judge made several observations as

to how it was disappointing why the parties were not settling and that

the district court as a judicial officer must protect the other judicial

officers and that it was likely that this case would be referred to the

Supreme Court for violation of rights of a judicial officer which would take

an immensely long time period to be heard and determined".

11. Both sets of official defendants deny paragraph 41 of the second

amended petition which says,

"The petitioner states that in all of the above circumstances the

petitioner is of the humble and respectful view that the further

continuation and the proceeding of the matter in district court of

Kaduwela before the Hon. District Judge of Kaduwela is not in the

5 | 1 5 2 0 1 9 R I I J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s ti c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

interest of justice that a fair and impartial trial cannot be held to the

cause of the 01st defendant for any one or more of the following reasons;

(a) It appears to the petitioner that the Learned District Judge is

prejudiced against the 02nd to 04th defendants who have as public

officers carried out certain functions in terms of the law and with respect

to the decisions they have made which have aggrieved another judicial

officer, the plaintiff,

(b) The petitioner is of the view that the learned district judge's mind

has been affected by the fact that the plaintiff is a judicial officer just like

the learned district judge and that a judicial officer should not be caused

any inconvenience or grievance in any form or manner whatsoever and

that persons who are responsible for such a wrong doers,

(c) The petitioner is of the respectful view that the learned district

judge is of the view that even irrespective of the Law and the facts

relevant that the plaintiff's complaint is valid and genuine and that the

defendants should be at fault in one way or the other,

(d) It appears that the learned district judge has made certain

observations and comments towards the 02nd to 04th respondents which

do not give confidence to the petitioner that an objective decision will be

taken or a correct decision will be taken in this matter,

(e) The manner in which the learned district judge has negotiated a

possible settlement gives an appearance that the learned district judge

does not agree to any determination other than that of a determination in

agreement with the plaintiff,

6 | 1 5 2 0 1 9 R I I J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s ti c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

(f) It appears that the learned district judge was unhappy that the

01st defendant was not willing to settle the matter as proposed to end

the dispute and fears that this may cause some prejudice towards the

01st defendant,

(g) It appears that only the plaintiff's concerns are fully and thoroughly

appreciated by the learned district judge but the material put forward by

the defendants have been neglected at all times,

(h) The reluctance of the learned district judge to allow the

objections to jurisdiction to be heard and determined cause grave concern

that the petitioner's case may not be given a fair hearing,

(i) The statement from the Bench stating that the order will be made

permanent and that it is better to settle than object has caused concern in

the mind of the petitioner that irrespective of the merits the interim

injunction will be issued so as to greatly pressure the 01st defendant to

settle in order to obtain its electricity supply which is of urgent necessity,

(j) The 02nd respondent being the Divisional Secretary of Kaduwela

maybe subject to several additional pressures due to the existence of this

case being heard in the relevant area and also the 03rd respondent being

in charge of Kaduwela district may also subject to further pressures and

therefore it may be suitable that a judge of another district zone may

hear this matter,

(k) at most times the record of the action has been kept in the

chambers of the learned district judge,

7 | 1 5 2 0 1 9 R I I J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s ti c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

(l) The instance of the plaintiff being told to remain in chambers

of the learned district judge when she appeared in open court has eroded

the confidence of the 01st defendant in the learned judge,

(m) Justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done".

12. Both sets of official defendants deny averments in paragraph 44 of

the second amended petition which says,

"The 01st defendant petitioner states that in the above circumstances

the enjoining order dated 16th September 2019 should be set aside in

limine on any of the following grounds,

(a) Lack of jurisdiction in terms of section 23 and 24 of the

Interpretation Ordinance,

(b) Lack of jurisdiction due to section 39 of the Electricity Act,

(c) Action being misconceived due to the validity and existence of the

decision marked Z.01 dated 01.02.2019,

(d) The grave suppression and misrepresentation of facts by the

plaintiff in obtaining the enjoining order,

(e) The lack of a prima facie case and or a balance of convenience in

favour of the plaintiff".

13. Both sets of official defendants deny the averments in paragraph 45

of the second amended petition, which says,

8 | 1 5 2 0 1 9 R I I J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s ti c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

"The 01st defendant petitioner states that the learned district judge of

Kaduwela has not been inclined to take up or allow the 01st defendant

petitioner to support its application to set aside the enjoining order and or

the 01st defendant petitioner reasonably believes that his honour may

refuse to dissolve the enjoining order in the circumstances pleaded".

14. Both sets of defendants deny paragraph 46 of the second amended

petition, which says,

"The 01st defendant petitioner also states that the order dated

11.11.2019 and proceedings thereto should be set aside for one or more

of the following reasons,

(a) Ex facie it was brought to the attention of court that this court has

no jurisdiction but the court has avoided making an appropriate order,

(b) The learned district judge had no jurisdiction to refer any

matter to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka,

(c) This is even further so as the 01st defendant has not consented to

such a proposal,

(d) The learned district judge has no power to make orders that are to

bind the parties at the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka,

(e) The learned district judge ex facie by order appears to have implied

that the plaintiff is correct and the defendants are wrong,

(f) The learned district judge was procedurally incorrect in partially

halting the submission of the 01st defendant under section 664(2) and

directing such submissions be made in writing,

(g) The learned district Judge was incorrect to assume jurisdiction and

continue to assume jurisdiction when the question of jurisdiction was

brought up before him,

(h) The learned district judge has failed to record that the extension of

the enjoining order was not of consent of the 01st defendant".

15. Both sets of official defendants also deny averments in paragraph

47(a)(b)(d)(g)(h) and (i) of the second amended petition, which are,

"The 01st defendant states that the order dated 04.12.2019 must be

revised and set aside for following reasons,

(a) It is a settlement recorded without obtaining the consent of all

parties with objections raised,

(b) It is an order which is ex facie favorable to the plaintiff and

made on the presumption that plaintiff's contentions are held to be

correct,

(d) It is an order which goes absolutely contrary to the matters

pleaded by the plaintiff herself,

(g) It is an order which may affect the rights of the third parties who

are not before this court,

10 | 1 5 2 0 1 9 R I I J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n &J u s ti c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

(h) It is an order of a coercive nature against the 01st defendant in a

matter where the 01st defendant has duly presented its stance in addition to the

other parties who have all being deprived of a fair hearing,

(i)It is an order gravely affecting the rights of the 01st defendant for no

reason whatsoever".

16. Furthermore, it appears that paragraph 07 of the second amended petition

has been accepted by 02 and 05 defendants, whereas it has been denied by 03

and 04 defendants. The said paragraph 07 reads,

The Petitioner further states that on the said day the Learned District

Judge made comment about the conduct of the 1st Defendant in obtaining a

supply of electricity in a manner that was inconveniencing the life of the

Plaintiff who was a Judicial Officer and that this Order will be made

permanent unless remedial steps are taken by the Defendants.

17. The 02 and 05 defendants as well as 03 and 04 defendants have admitted

paragraph 26 of the second amended petition, which says,

The Petitioner states that when the Plaintiff arrived in Open Court the

Learned District Judge told the Plaintiff that she need not remain in Open

Court and can retire to the Chambers of the District Judge.

18. The 02, 05 as well as 03, 04 defendants are unaware and hence deny

paragraph 34 of the second amended petition. The said paragraph 34 is

connected to paragraph 33 which read,

33- The Petitioner states the Learned District Judge fixed the matter for 4th

December 2019 at 2.30 PM for Oral Submissions in respect of the decision

of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka.

34- The Petitioner states with utmost respect that it is bewildering as to

(the) purpose of such a step in the District Court where the matter of

inquiry has to be the Enjoining Order and the Interim Injunction.

11 | 1 5 2 0 1 9 R I I J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n &J u s ti c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

19. The 02, 05 defendants as well as 03, 04 defendants are unaware and hence

deny paragraph 42 of the second amended petition which reads,

The Petitioner further states that though none of the above events except

the proceedings of the 11th November 2019 and the 4th December 2019 are

of record that these events were observed by Counsel for the Petitioner Mr.

Harith De Mel Attorney at Law, Instructing Attorney for the Petitioner Mrs.

Gayanga Wijetunge Attorney at Law among others.

20. It would be noted that paragraph 42 refers to above events which are

referred to in paragraph 41 which has sub paragraphs (a) to (m), which as

aforesaid has been denied by 02, 05 as well as 03,04 defendants in the exact

form they are pleaded at present.

21. The said paragraph 41 was reproduced above and it may be noted that it

mainly contained certain allegations against the Learned District Judge, that

he was prejudiced against the 02 and 04 defendants, his mind, has been

affected by the fact that the plaintiff is a Judicial Officer, the Plaintiffs

complaint is valid and genuine even irrespective of the law, he made certain

observations and comments towards the 02 and 04 defendants which do not

give confidents to the petitioner that an objective decision will be taken or a

correct decision will be taken, the manner he negotiated a possible settlement

gave the appearance that he does not agree to any determination other than a

determination in an agreement with the plaintiff, he was unhappy that the 01st

defendant was not willing to settle the matter as proposed, the plaintiff and the

01st defendant were differently treated, there was a grave concern that the

petitioners case may not be given a fair hearing, statements from Bench

stating that the order will be made permanent and it is better to settle than

object , the 02 and 03 defendants who are in charge of Kaduwela area may be

subject to additional pressure, the record of the case was at most times kept in

the Chambers of the Learned District Judge, the plaintiff being told to remain

in the Chamber of the Learned District Judge has eroded the confidence of the

01st defendant in the Learned District Judge and Justice must not only be

done but seen to be done.

22. The said official defendants have also accepted sub paragraphs (a) (b) and

(c) of paragraph 43 which read,

The Petitioner states that the result of this case also has an overall

bearing and impact on;

a. The rule of law,

b. Independence of the judiciary,

c. The equality before law of all persons, and..

Therefore, whilst the official defendants do not accept and therefore deny,

in the exact form they are pleaded at present, of several allegations of

bias and prejudice against the Learned District Judge, they accept, the

above sub paragraphs of paragraph 43 and paragraph 26 of the second

amended petition that when the plaintiff arrived in open court, the

learned District Judge asked her to retire to the Chambers of the Learned

District Judge.

23. The petitioner relied on the book Judicial Conduct Ethics and

Responsibilities 2002, of Dr. A.R.B. Amerasinghe.

It is stated in page 526 of the said book that,

In some Sri Lankan decisions of the Court of Appeal73 following dicta of

G.P.S. De Silva J, a Judge of the Court of Appeal as he then was74

emphasis has been laid on the fact that a Judge is a person with a

73 Daya Weththasinghe Vs. Mala Ranawaka [1989] 1 SLR 86 at page 92 and Dr. Karunarathne Vs. Attorney General and another [1995] 2 SLR 298 at page 301

Silva J. repeated his dicta in Marcus Vs. the Attorney General (1984) Sriskanthas LR 131 at page 13313 | 1 5 2 0 1 9 R I I J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n &J u s ti c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

trained legal mind and that it is serious matter to allege bias against a

Judicial Officer and that a reviewing court would not lightly entertain

such an allegation. The Court of Appeal did not, as it should have,

acknowledge the fact that apparent bias disqualifies, as does actual

bias.

24. The said book also said at page 528

A judge may not be disqualified for prejudice unless it is shown that the

prejudice is directed against the party, and is of such a nature and

character as it would render it importable that under the circumstances

the party could have received a fair and impartial trial75. The bias or

prejudice must be overall, and if a judge has a bias or prejudice on a

particular point this may not be sufficient to disqualify him or her if the

judge can make his or her decision without being controlled by the

judges preconception76. Bias or prejudice does not mean the total

absence of preconceptions in the mind of a judge, since the human

mind is not a blank piece of paper77, or a tabula rasa, as Justice

Rehnquist described it78.

The above two passages were under the heading Actual Bias and Apparent

Bias.

25. At page 537 under the heading Proving actual or apparent bias or

prejudice, it is stated,

75 State v Pizzuto, 119 Idaho 742, 810 P 2d 680, stay granted (US) 1991 US LEXIS 4039 and overruled in part on other grounds by State v Card, (Idaho) 1991 Ida LEXIS 155 andcert. den. (US) 117 L Ed 495, 112 S. Ct.1268.

The law presumes that a judge is unbiased and unprejudiced79. Judges

are credited with the ability to remain objective notwithstanding there

having been exposed to information which might prejudice a person80. It

has been said that there is a strong presumption that judges are

impartial participants in the legal process, whose duty is to preside as

qualified is as strong as their duty to refrain from presiding when not

qualified81, and that a judge will not involve himself or herself in a

proceeding in which he or she cannot be impartial82.

26. It is also stated at page 538 of the said book,

We have seen that a showing of actual bias is not necessary to

disqualify a judge, for the policy of the law is to require disqualification

in cases of apparent bias83. There are various explanations for that rule.

One view is that it is a hopeless exercise to probe any persons mind.

In 1477 Chief Justice Brian said84 , Comen erudition est q I entent dun

home ne serr trie, car le Diable nad conusance de Ientent de home:

anglice, it is common knowledge that the thought of a man shall not be

tried, for the Devil himself knoweth not the thought of man.

27. Under the same heading the book says at page 541,

The judges confidence in his ability to hear a matter impartially

because of the judges training and experience is irrelevant if a

reasonable onlooker may in the circumstances of the case doubt his

impartiality. In Johnson v District Court of County of Jefferson85 it was

held that although the judge is convinced of his or her own impartiality,

if it non the less appears to the parties or to the public that the judge

may be biased or prejudiced, the same harm to public confidence in the

administration of justice occurs. Public confidence in the impartiality of

the judiciary is the core issue. Thus in Kandasamy Vs. Subramaniam86

despite the assurance from the magistrate, whom the Supreme Court

described as a judge of considerable experience and seniority in the

judicial service, that he was confident that he could impartially hear and

decide the case, the court allowed an application to have the case

transferred before another judge.

28. The said book at page 546, 547 under the heading Judge, must

adjudicate unless disqualification is required says,

In the absence of a valid reason for disqualification, a judge has a

duty of hearing a case assigned to the judge87. R.W. Watson, Ex parte

Armstrong88, it was stated: [the] principle is that a judge should not sit to

hear a case if in all the circumstances the parties or the public might

entertain a reasonable apprehension that he might not bring an

or apprehension or real danger?, says at page 572.

The picture in Sri Lanka is far from clear. In Kandasamy v

Subramaniam89 L.B. De Silva J in the Supreme Court said: it would

appear from the authorities cited to this Court that the real test in

deciding an application of this nature is not whether the Judge in fact

would be prejudiced and that the parties would not get an impartial

hearing but whether the party to a case or even the general public may

have some reason to feel that the course of justice was not was not

absolutely fair and impartial. The report of the case does not show what

authorities were cited. The reasonable suspicion or apprehension test

has been used by the Supreme Court in some cases90. T.S. Fernando J

in In re Ratnagopal91 formulated the test as follows: Would a reasonable

man, in all the circumstances of the case, believe that there was a real

likelihood of [the adjudicator] being biased against him? That test was

followed by Wimalaratne J in W.D. Simon and others Vs. The

Commissioner of National Housing and 3 Others92. Both the reasonable

suspicion test and real likelihood tests were applied by the Supreme

Court in Bandaranaike Vs. De Alwis93. Although in the Court of Appeal

G.P.S. De Silva J (as he then was) referred to the the reasonable

suspicion and real likelihood tests in Abdul hasheeb Vs. Mendis

90 E.g. see Bogahalande Vs. Podi Sinno (1915) 1 Ceylon Weekly Reporter 99; Carberry Vs. Wickramasinghe (1917) IV Ceylon Weekly Reporter 158 at 159.) The real likelihood test was applied by Akbar J in Vanrooyen v Perera. ((1933) 35 NLR 186, 187

Perera and others94 it was found not to be necessary to choose between

them. However, G.P.S. De Silva J in Marcus Vs. Attorney General95 chose

to apply the reasonable suspicion test, which he described as the less

rigorous test. In Dr. Karunaratne Vs. Attorney General and Another96 the

Court of Appeal applied both tests. The real likelihood test was applied

by the Court of Appeal in Mohamed Mohideen Hassen et al. Vs. N.S. Peiris

et. Al97., Daya Weththasinghe Vs. Mala Ranawaka98; and in

Samarasinghe Vs. Samarasinghe99. See also Shell Gas Lanka Ltd. Vs.

Goonawardene J, followed Paul Jacksons view102 that the somewhat

confusing welter of authority does not indicate a genuine difference of

opinion on the correct test to apply but rather a confusing variety of

ways of describing one test. The real difficulty is applying the test to the

facts of particular cases. Goonawardene J followed the simple test

suggested by Lord Carson in Frome United Breweries Vs. Bath JJ [1926]

AC 586, 618), namely, whether there was such a likelihood of bias as

entitled the court to interfere.

30. Under the heading The basic rule and its rationale. It is said in page

573,

A number of principles govern the question of disqualification for bias or

prejudice, but they seem to have developed from a basic rule, namely,

that it is axiomatic that no man can be at once judge and suitor nemo

potest esse simul actor et judex. 364

It has been a maxim of the law that aliquis non debet esse judex in

propria causa, quia non potest esse judex et pars. 365 the principle nemo

debet esse judex in propria sua causa or nemo judex in re sua- no man

can be a judge in his own cause- came to be recognized and observed in

practice by the English courts from early times. Bertram CJ observed: It

is an axiom of English Law, as ancient as the Law itself366 the rules has

been recognized in the USA, 367 and has been applied to disqualify a

judge who is member of a class on whose behalf a class action is

brought. 368 at least as early as the fourteenth century common law

judges were held to be incompetent to hear cases in which they were

themselves parties. 369

31. It is also interesting to note that the book says under the heading

Legislative variation of the basic rule, at age 574,

Consequently, in the seventeenth century, and faintly even into the

eighteenth century, it was asserted that Parliament could not make laws that

were against natural justice. Hobart CJ said: Even an Act of Parliament

made against natural equity, as to make a man judge in his own cause is

void in itself; for jura naturae sunt immutabilia, and they are leges

legum. 375 a few years earlier, in Dr. Bonhams case 376 Chief Justice Coke

had said that the court could declare an Act of Parliament void if it made a

man a judge in his own cause, or was otherwise against common right and

reason. Holt CJ said in 1701 377 that Cokes view was far from any

extravagancy, for it is a very reasonable and true saying, that if an Act of

Parliament should ordain that the same person shall be party and Judge ..

it would be a void Act of Parliament.

In the eighteenth- century Blackstone 378 expressed the principle in a way

somewhat more fitting to modern ears: Thus if an Act of Parliament gives a

man power to try all causes that arise within his manor of Dale; yet if a cause

should arise in which he is himself a party, the Act is construed not to extend

to that, because it is unreasonable that any man should determine his own

quarrel.

32. Having so examined of the impartiality of Judges, if one takes a look at the

written submissions of the plaintiff respondent, dated 08th April 2021, it is

filled with advice to the 01st defendant petitioner; the former part as to what

other remedies at law were available to the petitioner and the latter part as to

how the 33,000 volt wire should be laid, whether it should be by a zig-zag

method or by underground cables. But it must be hastily added that the

aforesaid statement is not in complete jest, for the said latter part should be

taken serious note of, when it comes to the safety of the plaintiff and her

family, of which more will be said later.

33. When the plaintiff argues that the petitioner could have made an

application to the district court itself for the vacation of the enjoining order or

leave to appeal applications in respect of other orders to the Provincial High

Court that exercise civil appellate jurisdiction, one must not forget the fact that

initially the present application was coupled with a transfer application, No.

08/2019/TRF, on the basis of the alleged bias of the learned District Judge.

Hence this court does not agree with the plaintiff when she alleges that the

petitioner joined three orders in restitutio in integrum to circumvent its delay

in making applications to vacate the enjoining order or leave to appeal

applications. Therefore this court decides that the cases such as Sri Lanka

Insurance Corporation Ltd., vs. Shanmugam and another (1995) 1 SLR 55

and Don Lewis vs. Dissanayake 70 NLR 8 are not applicable.

21 | 1 5 2 0 1 9 R I I J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n &J u s ti c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

34. For the same reason authorities that says restitutio in integrum is not

available when there is another remedy, such as Perera et al vs.

Wijewickreme 15 NLR 411 and Menchinahamy vs. Muniweera (1950) 51

NLR 409 (the latter case only with regard to this effect) are not applicable.

35. Despite the 02,05 respondents and 03,04 respondents have not accepted

several allegations made by the petitioner against the learned district judge, as

discussed in the earlier portion of this judgment, those respondents have

accepted the petitioners allegation that the plaintiff when present in court was

asked to retire to the Chamber of the judge, by the learned district judge since

she is a judicial officer. The authorities discussed in an earlier portion of this

judgment regarding Actual Bias and Apparent Bias and reasonable

suspicion test and real likelihood test will show that the question posed by

T.S. Fernando J., in In re Ratnagopal, Would a reasonable man, in all the

circumstances of the case, believe that there was a real likelihood of [the

adjudicator] being biased against him? has to be answered Yes.

36. Therefore, this court acting in restitutio in integrum, sets aside the orders

dated 16.09.2019, 11.11.2019, 04.12.2019 and 10.12.2019. In doing so this

court takes note of the case of Menchinahamy vs. Muniweera (1950) 51 NLR

409, in which Dias S.P.J., said,

The situation which emerges in the present case is that Saineris was

a, party. He died before the trial without steps having been taken to

substitute his heirs who were, therefore, not bound by all the

subsequent proceedings. In giving relief to the petitioner we are not

sitting in judgment either on the interlocutory decree or on the decree in

appeal passed by this Court. We are merely declaring that, so far as

the petitioner-is concerned, there has been a violation of the

principles of natural justice which makes it incumbent on this

22 | 1 5 2 0 1 9 R I I J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n &J u s ti c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

Court, despite technical objections to the contrary, to do justice103.

In my opinion, therefore, the order of this Court should be that the

petitioner and the other heirs of Saineris should be forthwith added as

parties to this action, and that after she has filed her statement of claim,

the District Judge should proceed to adjudicate on the merits of her

application.

Dias S.P.J. thus set aside a decree entered pursuant to a judgment given by

two judges of the former Supreme Court (Supreme Court of Ceylon). He did so

accompanied on the Bench with Gunasekera J., who agreed with him. Thus,

even the decree of the same court was set aside exercising the power of

restitutio in integrum.

37. The judgment of Dias S.P.J. in Menchinahamy vs. Muniweera was cited

with approval, by Ranasinghe J., in His Lordships minority judgment in

Vinayagam Ganeshanatham v. Vivienne Goonewardene [1984] 1 Sri L. R.

319 and by Amerasinghe J., in JEYARAJFERNANDO PULLE V.

PREMACHANDRA DE SILVA AND OTHERS 1996 in the only judgment in that

case. But in both cases, the present Supreme Court did not set aside its own

judgment or order. Perhaps Dias S.P.J. was the last Judge in the former

Supreme Court to have exercised the power of restitutio in integrum to set

aside even its own judgment.

38. Incidentally in Vinayagam Ganeshanatham v. Vivienne Goonewardene

[1984] 1 Sri L. R. 319 the learned Chief Justice (who wrote the leading

judgment in the majority) said,

103 Dias S.P.J. said at page 413 It was argued that the Supreme Court by means of restitutio in integrum cannot vary its own decrees, especially after they have passed the Seal of the Supreme Court.23 | 1 5 2 0 1 9 R I I J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n &J u s ti c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

He submits that this caption read with prayer (a) to the petition

invokes a jurisdiction in revision which this Court does not have. One

has to look at the legislation which created this Court to find an answer

to this dispute. That legislation is to be found in the second Republican

Constitution of 1978. The Supreme Court which existed up to the

time of the first Republican Constitution of 1972 and which

continued to exist under that Constitution ceased to exist when the

1978 Constitution became operative. (Vide Article 105 (2) of the

Constitution). Its place was taken by the Court of Appeal (Vide Article

169 (2) of the 1978 Constitution). A new Supreme Court has been

constituted which is the highest and final Superior Court of Record.

(Article 118 of the Constitution).

Hence even on an empirical basis, so to say, what is similar to the then

Supreme Court is the present Court of Appeal, which means that the Court of

Appeal has every authority to act in restitutio in integrum in the way the old

Supreme Court did. Besides under Article 138 of the Constitution, the power of

restitutio in integrum is judicially vested in the Court of Appeal.

39. This court does not wish to reproduce the orders dated 11.11.2019,

04.12.2019 and 10.12.2019 adding to the length of this judgment. But the

reading of those orders shows a strong bias towards the plaintiff and prejudice

towards the petitioner. Some of the directions in those orders such as the order

dated 04.12.2019 issuing an interim injunction against the 04th defendant

respondent and the order dated 10.12.2019 issuing an interim injunction

against the 01st defendant petitioner are irrational. Hence those three orders

are set aside with immediate effect.

40. It may be noted that Dias S.P.J. said in Menchinahamy vs. Muniweera

that His Lordship is exercising the power of restitutio in integrum because

there was a breach of the rule audi alteram partem. Same thing could be said

24 | 1 5 2 0 1 9 R I I J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n &J u s ti c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

here because when the adjudicator shows bias towards one party, he does not

properly hear the opposing party.

41. The order dated 16.09.2019 is the enjoining order. As already said despite

the prejudice caused to the 01st defendant petitioner, there is a danger by

laying high tension wires by the 01st defendant through other defendants close

to her (plaintiff respondents) house. Considering this danger, although the

orders dated 11.11.2019, 04.12.2019 and 10.12.2019 are immediately set

aside and the position before making those orders is restored, the cancellation

of the order dated 16.09.2019 will only take effect in 03 months or when the

present learned district judge makes an order either granting or refusing the

same enjoining order or a different enjoining order to be claimed by the plaintiff

respondent within 02 months from this judgment, whichever happens first.

42. That is to say, the order dated 16.09.2019 will be cancelled in 03 months

from this judgment. But if the plaintiff respondent, within 02 months of this

judgment goes before the district court in a fresh application for the same or

different enjoining order and interim injunction, the order dated 16.09.2019

will be cancelled on the granting or refusal of such enjoining order.

43. Subject to that the appeal of the petitioner is allowed with costs.
