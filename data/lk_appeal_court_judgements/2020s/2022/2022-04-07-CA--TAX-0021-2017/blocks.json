But the delay should not render null and void the proceedings and prejudicially affect the parties, as the parties have no control over the proceedings. It could not have been intended that the delay should cause a loss of the jurisdiction that the Commissioner had, to give an effective order of approval or refuse.

Nevertheless, Section 140 provides that within thirty days from the date of the decision or upon lapse of ninety days from the request being made for an administrative review, the tax payer is entitled to make an appeal to the TAC. Hence, it becomes clear that while the breach of certain time limits is accompanied by remedies or sanctions, the breach of others is not. It is important to note that, Section 144 of the 2017 Act provides that if the TAC fails either to determine or to respond to an appeal filed by a person within ninety days from the appeal request, the Appellant is entitled to appeal to the Court of Appeal.",

Even if some other significant right were to be infringed upon, it would not",

One has to give a practical and a meaningful interpretation to the usual day to day functions or steps taken in a court of law or a statutory body involved in quasi judicial functions, duty or obligation. If specific time limits are to be laid down the legislature need to say so in very clear unambiguous terms instead of leaving it to be interpreted in various ways. To give a restricted interpretation would be to impose unnecessary sanctions on the Board of Review. It would be different or invalid if the time period exceeded 2 years from the date of oral hearing. If that be so it is time barred (emphasis added).",

The matter in issue in deciding that particular question of law was whether or not the two-year time limit applicable to the Board of Review was to be counted from the date of receipt of the Petition of Appeal by the Board, or whether it was to be counted from the date of commencement of the hearing of the appeal. That matter was decided in favour of the Respondent, with the Court holding the latter to be the case.",

It is therefore the duty of the Legislature to specify what penal consequence or remedy, if any, must follow a lack of substantial compliance by the TAC with the time frame specified in Section 10 of the TAC Act, so that the parties are not inconvenienced.",

    "text": "It is important to note that Section 165(7) itself provides that upon receipt of a valid petition of appeal the CGIR may cause further inquiry to be made by an Assessor or Assistant Commissioner, other than the Assessor or Assistant Commissioner who made the assessment in appeal. Hence, it is clear that the intention of the Legislature in enacting aforementioned provisions in Section 208 and 217 are not to curtail the authority of the CGIR causing an Assessor to do any act which is to be done under the Inland Revenue Act. The learned Counsel for the Appellant, profusely referring to Sections 165 (6), 208 and 217 argued that the combined effect of those Sections is that the CGIR himself should acknowledge the appeal. At this stage it is pertinent to examine whether the acknowledgement of an appeal is a statutory obligation cast upon the CGIR himself. Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of works is the case where the famous doctrine known as Caltona Principle on delegation of authority was set out. Lord Green, M. R. delivering the judgment explained the principle as follows; In the administration of government in this country, the functions which are given to ministers (and constitutionally properly given to ministers, because they are constitutionally responsible) are functions so multifarious that no minister could ever personally attend to them. To make the example of the present case, no doubt there have been thousands of requisitions in this country by individual ministries. It cannot be supposed that this regulation meant that in each case, the minister in person should direct his mind to the matter. The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers given to ministers are normally exercised under the authority of the ministers by responsible officials of the department. Public business could not be carried on if that were not the case. Constitutionally, the decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister. The minister is responsible. It is he who must answer before Parliament for anything that his officials have done under his authority, and, if for an important matter he selected an official of such junior standing that he could not be expected competently to perform the work, the minister would have to answer for that in Parliament. The whole system of departmental organisation and administration is based on the view",

The functions of the Inland Revenue Department are so multifarious that no Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue could ever personally attend to all of them. In particular, Court will be slow to impose such requirements unless there is unequivocal language in the IR Act. It is true that the appeal has to be submitted to the respondent. However, that does not mean that the acknowledgement to be made by the respondent. Similar approach has been taken by our Courts in applying the Carltona principle in relation to administrative functions to be performed by Ministers (M.S.Perera v. Forest Department and another [(1982) 1 Sri. L.R. 187] amd Kuruppu v. Keerthir Rajapakse, Conservator of Forests [(1982) 1 Sri. L.R. 163]. The question of acknowledgement of an appeal arises out of Section 165 (6) of the Act. The Section stipulates the period within which an appeal should be acknowledged and also provides that where it was not so acknowledged the consequence would be that the appeal deem to have been acknowledged on the day it was delivered to the CGIR. However, it is important to observe that nowhere in Section 165 (6) it is stated that the acknowledgement should be done by the CGIR himself, whereas proviso to Section 165 (1), 165 (4) and Sections 165 (7), 165 (8), 165 (9), 165 (10), 165 (11), 165 (12), 165 (13), 165 (14) and 165 (15) specifically enacts the function of the CGIR.",

Upon a careful of consideration of Section 165 of the Inland Revenue Act, I am of the view that Section 165 (6) does not envisage that the CGIR himself should acknowledge the appeal. In the above analysis it is my considered view that the acknowledgment of an appeal is not an act the CGIR himself should have to do or should delegate his power to another officer authorising him to sign the acknowledgment on his behalf. There may be thousands of taxpayers in Sri Lanka and the acknowledgement of appeals submitted to the CGIR personally would be an impossible exercise. In my view that the acknowledgment of an appeal is a step within the process of making further inquiries into the appeal submitted by the taxpayer. Therefore, I am of the view, the Assessor, acknowledging an appeal acting on the directions given by the CGIR under Section 165 (7) of the Inland Revenue Act is valid in law. The nature of an acknowledgment of an appeal is merely an administrative act. Therefore, the only reasonable inference this Court could draw is that the Assessor has acknowledged the appeal on the implied delegation of authority by the CGIR. The Appellants contention is that since there was no proper acknowledgement of the appeal, the appeal should be deemed to have been received by the CGIR on the, 13th December 2013, the day it was delivered to the CGIR.",

Muller v. Baldwin (1874) L. R. 9 Q. B. 457, per cur., at p. 461. This definition supports the view that the ship should carry the fuel beyond the limit of the port, for the purpose of consumption. However, this definition is also based on the Tyne Coal Dues Act, 1872 in the United Kingdom. Therefore, in my view this definition could not be applied in a general sense in deciding the case in hand. After examining the definitions in the above dictionaries and other definitions, it appears that different dictionaries have given different definitions of the word \"export\". Therefore, in my view, it is unsafe to rely on any one of those dictionary definitions to decide the issue at hand.

The definition given in a statute is for effectuating the provisions of that statute and not for effectuating the provisions of another statute. A definition given in an Act cannot be used for purposes of another Act. The material language of the section has to be always borne in mind, for if a court is prone to indulge in exposition and attempted definition, it will be substituting the language chosen by Parliament with some other form of words and in an attempt at wide survey, some essential factor will be omitted or some inessential factor be substituted or added.",

However, along with the word export, the words sell, supply and distribute also appear in this Section as alternatives.

The test is that the goods must have a foreign destination where they can be said to be imported. However, as I have already been stated in this judgement, marine bunker fuel, which is consumed by the ship on its journey may not reach a foreign destination. Yet, in my view, for marine bunker fuel to be treated as having been exported, it should be supplied to a ship which is outbound from Sri Lanka. It is obvious that a ship which leaves the territory of Sri Lanka will not stay in high seas indefinitely. It should reach a foreign port. If the same ship returns to a Sri Lankan port due to some unforeseen or catastrophic event, the supply could still be treated as an export, but not otherwise.",

In fact, the Respondent has raised this issue in their written submission filed in this Court by stating that the contracts entered into by the Appellant do not provide for a terminus outside the territorial waters of Sri Lanka55. The ship/vessel being a non-resident ship/vessel should not be the test in determining this fact, since, there may be non-resident ships, registered in a foreign country, providing services within the Sri Lankan territory. However, it is unfortunate that in the case in hand, none of these documents were produced. It appears that even the Respondent, the CGIR, has not taken any step under Section 215 of the Inland Revenue Act to search for these documents. Nevertheless, since the Appellant is claiming a tax exemption in this case, the burden lies on the Appellant to establish its eligibility for the said exemption.",

Therefore, it was submitted that the Appellants sale of bunker fuel, a transaction in foreign currency, constitutes an export.
