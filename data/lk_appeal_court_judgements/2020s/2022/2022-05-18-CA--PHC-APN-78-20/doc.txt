This is a revision application filed on 02.07.2019 against an order of the High

Court of Homagama dated 23.10.2019, which refused to set aside the conviction

and sentence of the petitioner by Magistrate Courts order dated 04.09.2018 &

25.09.2018, respectively.

The background facts pertinent to the instant application are as follows. The

petitioner was charged before the Magistrate Court of Kaduwela with cheating

(Section 402 of Penal Code). Petitioner pleaded not guilty, and the case proceeded

to trial, where the petitioner appeared in person and gave evidence under oath.

The prosecution led the evidence of four witnesses. PW01, was the virtual

complainant who claimed that a person named murali obtained Rs 350,000/-

by promising to secure her a teaching position. At the conclusion of the trial, the

learned Magistrate convicted the petitioner and sentenced him to two years of

rigorous imprisonment, a sum of Rs. 1,500/- (which carried a default sentence

of 3 months simple imprisonment) and ordered the petitioner to pay Rs.

100,000/- as compensation to PWO1 who was the virtual complainant (which

carried a default sentence of 6 months simple imprisonment). Aggrieved by such

conviction, the petitioner preferred an application to the High Court, which

affirmed the findings of the Magistrate Court. Hence, the petitioner has preferred

the instant application to the Court of Appeal. The petitioner further submitted

that he was unable to pursue an appeal against the High Court order dated

23.10.2019 as his application for leave to appeal (sent via the Prison Authority)

has been rejected.

During oral submissions, the counsel for the petitioner contended that he would

only be canvassing the sentencing order dated 25.09.2018 praying for a reduced

sentence for the petitioner. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that the

petitioner has been in remand custody for four years and that he is the father of

four children.

The counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent objected to any variance of

the sentence on the basis that the petitioner has been convicted and sentenced

on a previous occasion for a similar offence and cited the relevant judgment of

the Court of Appeal, which refused to vary the sentence imposed on the

petitioner. As such, counsel for the respondent drew the Courts attention to

Meera Saheeb Mahir v OIC, Thalangama CA(PHC)APN 64/2020 Court of Appeal

Minute Dated 16.11.2020, which dealt with a revision application filed by the

petitioner against an order of the High Court of Homagama. The respondent

submitted that the said revision application dealt with the instant petitioner

involving similar case facts of cheating. In CA(PHC)APN 64/2020, the petitioner

has cheated another victim by introducing himself as muralidharan and taking

Rs. 350,000/- as payment to secure a teaching position for the victim. The

counsel for the respondent further submitted that the petitioner has been named

as an IRC and that a variation of sentence is not warranted when there are three

convictions in similar cases, as was the case with the petitioner.

At the outset, I will set out the scope of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to

vary a sentence imposed by a lower court as it necessarily entails the Court of

Appeal interfering with the discretion exercised by such judge. In King Vs

Rankira 42 NLR 145, it was held: "The Court of Appeal will not interfere with the

judicial discretion of a Judge in passing sentence unless that discretion has been

exercised on a wrong principle" (see also King Vs E. M. T. De Saram 42 NLR 528).

Similarly, in The Attorney General v H. N. De Silva 57 NLR 121, Basnayake A.

C. J., speaking of the appellate jurisdiction and the power to interfere with the

discretion of the trial judge, made the following observations:

This Court has power in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction to

increase or reduce a sentence, and it is not contrary to the rules which apply

CA-CPA-78-20 18/05/2022 Page 5 of 6 IJ-23-22

to appellate tribunals that it should exercise its independent judgment in a

matter which is brought up before it in review and increase a sentence if it

thinks it should be increased. Learned Counsel for the respondent urged

that the quantum of sentence is a matter for the discretion of the trial Judge

and that the Court of Appeal ought not to interfere, unless it appears that

the trial Judge proceeded upon a wrong principle. He cited a number of

cases which state the principles which should guide an appellate tribunal

in altering a sentence passed by a Court of subordinate jurisdiction. Those

cases quite properly lay down the rule that an appellate Court will interfere

only when a sentence appears to err in principle or when the subordinate

Court has either failed to exercise its discretion or has exercised it

improperly or wrongly. It may not always appear as in this case how the

Court below has reached its decision, but, if upon the facts the appellate

Court may reasonably infer that in some way there has been a failure

properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the Court of first

instance, the exercise of the discretion may be reviewed.

Hence, it is settled law that the Court of Appeal will not interfere with the judicial

discretion vested with the trial judge by law unless such trial judge has operated

on a wrong principle of law or has failed to exercise its discretion or has exercised

it arbitrary, inappropriately or wrongly when imposing the sentence.

On a perusal of the order dated 04.09.2018, whereby the petitioner was

convicted, it is evident that the learned Magistrate has carefully analysed all the

evidence presented by the prosecution to hold that the ingredients of the offence

of cheating have been established beyond a reasonable doubt. Furthermore, the

learned Magistrate has carefully analysed the evidence given by the petitioner

and has concluded that it amounted to a mere denial.

The petitioner in the instant application is canvassing the sentence praying for

this Court to invoke its revisionary jurisdiction to impose a lesser sentence.

However, the only grounds averred by the petitioner in support of this contention

is his family condition.

CA-CPA-78-20 18/05/2022 Page 6 of 6 IJ-23-22

At this juncture, it is pertinent to refer to Section 403 of the Penal Code which

sets out the sentence when a person is convicted under the Section:

Whoever cheats and there by dishonestly induces the person deceived to

deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter, or destroy the whole

or any part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed,

and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be

punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine. (Emphasis added)

On 25.09.2018, the learned Magistrate has imposed a sentence of two years

rigorous imprisonment along with a fine and ordered compensation to be paid to

the virtual complainant. The only mitigating factor averred by the petitioner for a

sentence reduction is that he was the father of four young children and has been

in prison for nearly four years. This contention would not warrant, in any way,

an interference with the judicial discretion of the trial judge, which in the

considered opinion of this Court has been properly utilised in the instant case.

This Court sees no reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court or the

learned Magistrate.

Application dismissed.
