WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Balapitiya on

the counts of trafficking and possessing 4.90 grams of Heroin, offences

punishable under Section 54A(d) and 54A(b) of Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, respectively.

After the trial, the learned High Court Judge delivered her judgment on

29.03.2019 convicting the appellant for both counts and sentencing her

to Life Imprisonment. This appeal has been preferred against the said

conviction and sentence. Prior to the hearing of the appeal, written

submissions have been filed on behalf of both parties. At the hearing,

the learned Counsel for the appellant and the learned Senior State

Counsel for the respondent made oral submissions.

3

The learned counsel for the appellant informed at the hearing of the

appeal that he does not pursue with the 2nd ground stated in his written

submission. Accordingly, grounds of appeal are as follows:

I. Failed to prove the chain of productions.

II. The inconsistencies and contradictions have not been taken into

account.

III. Judgment was entered on wrong observations.

IV. The learned Judge has failed to apply the test of probability.

V. The learned Judge has failed to evaluate and give due

consideration to the evidence of the accused.

Failed to prove of the chain of productions

With regard to the chain of productions, the learned counsel for the

appellant contended that the production keeper of the Magistrates

Court has not been called to give evidence. The learned counsel

contended further that in several judicial authorities, it has been held

that identity of the productions and chain of productions must be

strictly proved in proving charges under Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

It is a recognized principle that in drug-related cases the prosecution

must prove the chain relating to the inward journey as decided in the

case of Witharana Doli Nona V. The Republic of Sri Lanka C.A. 19/99.

Also, in Perera V. Attorney General (1998)1 Sri L.R. 378 it was held

that It is a recognized principle that in a case of this nature, the

prosecution must prove that the productions had been forwarded to the

Analyst from proper custody, without allowing room for any suspicion

that there had been no opportunity for tampering or interfering with the

production till they reach the Analyst. However, in the instant action,

necessity has not been arisen to call the production keeper of the

Balapitiya Magistrate Court in evidence to establish the chain of

productions. PW14, PS 28259 Mahinda has given evidence and stated

that he handed over the productions on 08.08.2014 to the production

4

clerk of the Balapitiya Magistrate Court. He, himself has taken back the

productions from the Magistrate Court on 02.09.2014 to hand over the

same to the Government Analyst Department. It should be noted that

not a single question has been asked from PW14 challenging the fact

that the same productions handed over to the Magistrate Court were

taken back from the Magistrate Court. Therefore, his evidence that he

has taken back from the Magistrate Court the same production that he

handed over to the Magistrate Court is unchallenged. In addition,

document P16 is the memorandum issued by the Government Analyst

Department certifying the receiving of productions. In P16, it is stated

that PS 28259 Mahinda has handed over the productions to the

Government Analyst on 02.09.2014.

The necessity of proving the chain of productions in these cases is to

ensure that the same productions taken from the custody of the

accused have been handed over to the Government Analyst without

tampering. In the said case of Witharana Doli Nona V. The Republic of

Sri Lanka, it has been held further that The purpose of this principle

is to establish that the productions have not been tampered with. The

prosecution must prove that the production taken from the accused-

appellant was examined by the Government Analyst. In the instant

action, PW14 testifies that the same productions that he handed over

to the Balapitiya Magistrate Court have been taken back and handed

over to the Government Analyst Department. Therefore, it has been

proved in the instant action that the production taken from the

accused-appellant had been examined by the Government Analyst. So,

there is no necessity to call the production clerk or the production

keeper of the Magistrate Court in evidence to repeat the same thing.

Hence, I hold that there is no merit on that ground.

In addition, the learned counsel for the appellant raised a new

argument. He contended, although PW7 has searched the body of the

appellant and found the Heroin, the said production has not been

5

produced to her to identify. The learned Senior State Counsel contended

in reply that as PW1, PW4 and PW5 have identified the said production,

not producing the same to be identified by PW7 does not cause any

prejudice to the prosecution case.

As the PW7 had recovered production from the possession of the

appellant, it is better if she had also identified the production. However,

PW7 has not examined the contents that were in the pink colour bag

she found. So even if the productions are presented to her for

identification, she can only identify that it was the pink colour bag that

was on the outside of the parcel. PW1, PW4 and PW5 were there at the

time of recovering the productions. Those 3 witnesses have identified

that the pink colour bag which was produced in court was the bag

recovered from the possession of the appellant in which Heroin was

found inside subsequently. Therefore, not identifying the pink colour

bag by PW7 has not caused any prejudice to the prosecution case.

In the instant action, the learned counsel appeared for the accused-

appellant in the High Court has informed that the appellant does not

admit the chain of productions. At least, the learned counsel did not

admit the Government Analyst Report without calling an officer from

the Government Analyst Department in evidence. Therefore, the

prosecution had to call the retired Government Analyst to give evidence.

However, neither her evidence nor the contents of the Government

Analyst report were challenged when she was cross-examined. Only six

questions have been asked in cross-examination. Those questions are

also relevant to the percentage of the weight of the Heroin. Therefore, it

is precisely clear that the Government Analyst Report was not

challenged in any manner and the said report could have been easily

admitted without calling the retired Government Analyst to the courts.

At this stage, it is pertinent to note that trial Judges do not make use

of amended Section 414 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Section

6

414 provides room to admit the report of the Government Analyst and

the reports of the other government officers specified in the section as

evidence without such persons being called as witnesses.

Before the amendment, proviso to the Section 414(6) was as follows:

Provided that if in any case, the court of trial is of the opinion that

it is necessary or expedient that, or either party to the case request

that the Government medical officer or other medical witness or the

Government Analyst or Government Examiner of Questioned

Documents or Registrar of Finger Prints or Government Radiologist

or the Magistrate or Justice of the Peace or the interpreter or any

other witness referred to in the preceding subsections should be

present to give evidence at any particular trial to which the

deposition or report may refer, such officers shall be summoned

as witnesses for the purpose of giving evidence in the same

manner as the other witnesses for the prosecution (emphasis

added).

Before the amendment also, it was not compulsory to call those official

witnesses to give evidence but if either party requests, the Government

Analyst or any other officer had to be summoned to give evidence. The

court had no discretion in deciding whether the witness should be

summoned or not.

The aforesaid sub-section has been amended by Act No. 11 of 1988.

Proviso to sub-section (6) of section 414 has been substituted and the

said substituted proviso reads as follows:

Provided that if any case the court of trial is of the opinion on

the application of any party or otherwise and for reason to be

recorded that it is necessary that the Government Medical Officer

or other medical witness or the Government Analyst or Government

Examiner of Questioned Documents or the Registrar of Finger

Prints of Examiner of Motor Vehicles or Government Radiologist or

7

the Magistrate or Justice of the Peace or the interpreter or any other

witness referred to in the preceding subsections should be present

to give evidence at any particular trail to which the deposition or

report may refer, such officers shall be summoned as witnesses for

the purpose of giving evidence in the same manner as the other

witnesses for the prosecution.

So, before the amendment, expressing an opinion of the trial court was

limited to summoning an official witness by the court. If a party

requests to call a witness, the court could not express its opinion but

the witness has to be summoned to give evidence. However, after the

amendment, the party could make an application to call an official

witness but only on the opinion of the trial court, the said witness shall

be summoned to give evidence.

The learned Judges of the trial court should realize the remarkable

difference between the previous sub-section and the amended sub-

section. Before the amendment, if either party to the case requests to

call the government officer in evidence, such an officer shall be

summoned as a witness. Therefore, the court did not have the

discretion to summon or not to summon that witness. After the

amendment, the government officer shall be summoned as a witness

only if the court of trial is of the opinion that it is necessary that the

Government Analyst, the Government Medical Officer or other

government officers specified in the section should be present to give

evidence. This amendment has been introduced to minimize the delay

in disposing of criminal cases. In the instant action also, the retired

Government Analyst was called to give evidence unnecessarily. On one

hand, the case gets delayed, evidence that is not necessary to

adjudicate the case comes to the case record and on the other hand,

this retired government officer has to come from his private residence

to the courts spending her time and travel expenses. Therefore, the

8

learned trial judges must be mindful to use this legal provision to fulfill

the intention of the legislature.

The inconsistencies and contradictions have not been taken into

account

The learned counsel for the appellant has set out in his written

submissions, the contradictions that he relies upon. The learned

counsel has pointed out contradictions such as; whether there were

children at home at the time of the arrest; discrepancies in the evidence

regarding weather condition of that day; from what area of the body of

the appellant, the productions were found; how many rounds of search

were carried out. It was revealed from the evidence that children who

were there ran away at the time of the raid. PW1 said that the

production was found from the upper body of the appellant. PW4 said

that the production was detected from the top garment of the appellant.

So, it is obvious that the top garment is on the upper body of the

appellant. The weather condition of the day and other matters that were

pointed out as contradictions are also immaterial because the appellant

herself admits in her evidence that police officers came to her house on

that day, searched and a parcel of Heroin was found on the top of the

fan in the room. Therefore, it is apparent that there is no inconsistency

or contradiction which affects the credibility of the witnesses or the

credibility of the prosecution story.

Judgment was entered on wrong observations

In supporting this ground, the learned counsel for the appellant pointed

out that on page 23 of the Judgment, the learned Judge has observed

that it was not directly suggested to PW1 that Heroin was recovered

from the top of the fan which was in the living room. Also, the learned

Judge observed that it was not suggested that Heroin was not found

inside the appellants brazier. The learned counsel contended that in

9

fact, those suggestions were made to the prosecution witnesses and the

learned Judges aforesaid observations are wrong.

The learned Senior State Counsel for the respondent contended that it

was suggested to PW1 that Heroin was found on the top of the fan but

it was not suggested that it is the fan that was in the living room and

thus there is nothing wrong with the observation of the learned Judge.

The learned Judge has failed to apply the test of probability

For this ground, what the learned counsel for the appellant contended

was that the accused-appellant being a mother of an infant, can it be

believed the fact that she had worn a brassiere a few minutes after she

wakes up from the bed because usually, women do not wear brassieres

during the time of sleeping.

What we have to consider is not the usual position but the position that

the evidence reveals. In the instant action, there is no reason to

disbelieve the prosecution witnesses evidence that has been

corroborated by each other. Anyhow, the aforesaid fact pointed out by

the learned counsel for the appellant is not an improbability.

The learned Judge has failed to evaluate and give due consideration to

the evidence of the accused

It is incorrect to say that the learned Judge has failed to evaluate and

give due consideration to the evidence of the accused. In perusing the

impugned judgment, it is apparent that the learned Judge has

evaluated the evidence of the appellant and stated reasons in her

judgment why the accuseds evidence cannot be believed.

The learned counsel for the appellant drew the attention of this court

that the learned Judge has found that even though the parcel of Heroin

10

was on the top of the fan as described by the appellant, it cannot be

assumed that the Heroin was in the possession of some other person

because only the appellant occupied the said house at the time of the

raid. (Page 30 of the Judgment) What the learned counsel attempted to

point out was that it appears from the said observation that the learned

Judge has not completely rejected the defence version.

The learned Senior State Counsel contended that the learned Judge has

not accepted defence version in any manner but what the learned Judge

meant by this observation is that even according to the defence version,

the appellants exclusive possession would be proved. At the same time,

the learned Senior State Counsel admitted that this observation is really

unnecessary. I agree that the aforesaid observation of the learned High

Court Judge is unnecessary because once the defence version is

rejected, it is not necessary to analyzed whether exclusive possession

would be proved, if the defence version is accepted. However, the said

observation has not affected the learned Judges findings in any

manner, since the said observation does not indicate that the learned

Judge had not rejected the defence version, as submitted by the learned

Senior State Counsel.

As stated above, the learned High Court Judge found with reasons that

the appellants version could not be accepted. The learned Judge

observed that the appellant kept room for any changes to be made

subsequently when suggestions are made to the prosecution witnesses

in cross-examination. In addition, the learned Judge observed the

infirmities and inconsistencies in the appellants version. Therefore, the

learned High Court Judge has found that a reasonable doubt would not

be arisen due to the appellants version because the appellants version

could not be believed. In considering the entirety of the evidence, I am

of the view that the learned judge is correct in deciding that a

reasonable doubt would not be created on the prosecution case because

of the evidence of the appellant.

11

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that there is no merit on the grounds

of appeal urged by the learned counsel for the appellant. Accordingly,

the Judgment dated 29.03.2019, the conviction and the sentence are

affirmed.

Appeal dismissed.
