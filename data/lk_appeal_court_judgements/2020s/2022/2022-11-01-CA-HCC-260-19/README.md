WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The accused-appellant was indicted before the High Court of Chilaw on

two counts. The first count was committing House trespassing with the

intention of sexually abusing Warnakulasooriya Sathmi Sara on or

about 07.05.2010 an offence punishable under section 436 of the Penal

Code. The second count was committing the rape of the said victim in

the course of the same transaction an offence punishable under

Sections 364(2)(e) of the Penal Code.

3

After trial, the learned High Court Judge convicted the accused-

appellant for both counts. Accordingly, he was sentenced to 10 years

rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 20,000/- for the first count

with a default sentence of 6 months rigorous imprisonment and was

sentenced to 20 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 20,000/-

for the second count with a default sentence of 6 months rigorous

imprisonment. The accused-appellant was also ordered to pay Rs.

500,000/- compensation to the victim with a default sentence of 2 years

rigorous imprisonment. This appeal has been preferred against the said

convictions and sentences.

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant and

the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent made oral

submissions. Both parties have tendered their written submissions,

prior to the hearing.

In brief, the prosecution case is as follows:

The victim was a 13 years old girl at the time of the incident. She was

22 years old at the time of giving evidence before the High Court. On

the day in question, around 9.30 p.m., she was sleeping in her room.

She suddenly woke up and observed the accused-appellant who is a

known person residing closer to her residence, seated on her bed next

to her. She got frightened, then the appellant offered her a cup of water.

After drinking the water, she fell fast asleep. She claims that she

couldnt remember what happened afterwards. She woke up again to a

sound of a phone ringing. At the same time, her mother too knocked on

the room door. The appellant was naked inside the room. She was also

naked and as she got out of bed, he ran away. However, the prosecutrix

has explained the sexual acts performed by the appellant and stated

that the appellant would have engaged in the aforementioned sexual

acts for nearly 15 minutes. She has also stated that she struggled to

escape but failed.

4

The accused-appellant denies the allegations brought against him. In

his unsworn statement from the dock, the appellant stated that there

was a previous enmity between the victims family and him in respect

of a television remote control device. He and the victim's family were not

on good terms after the incident, and in retaliation, the appellant stated

that he was implicated for this offence that he did not commit. The same

defence has been suggested to PW-1 in cross-examination. PW-1

admitted in cross-examination that she scolded the appellant when

there was a quarrel while watching television.

The learned counsel for the appellant has stated 13 grounds of appeal

in his written submissions. However, having heard the submissions

made by the learned counsel for both parties, it is apparent that there

is one main ground of appeal to be considered. That is, whether the

prosecution has proved the two charges beyond a reasonable doubt. In

respect of the said ground, the learned counsel for the appellant

advanced his arguments on the basis that the prosecutrix, PW-1 is not

a credible witness and thus the charges cannot be proved based on her

testimony.

The learned counsel for the appellant contended that the prosecutrix

could not state the date, month, or at least the year, the offence was

committed when giving evidence and therefore the prosecution has not

proved that the appellant raped her on or about the date specified in

the charge. There is no dispute that she couldnt state the date of the

offence. When PW-1 was unable to state the date of the offence in her

evidence, the learned state counsel suggested not only the date of the

offence but also the dates that PW-1 made complaints to the police.

Normally, failing to remember the date of the offense in a child abuse

or statutory rape case would not be a reason to cast reasonable doubt

5

on the prosecution case because the victims in those cases are under

sixteen years, and it cannot be expected of a child faced with such

adversity to remember those dates precisely. Besides that, the

prosecutrix's inability to state the date of the offense would not

prejudice the accused if it was the only occasion she was raped. The

case at hand is different. PW-1 has stated that even before this incident,

she has been raped about six occasions by some other persons in the

village. Therefore, it is important for the prosecution that the date on

which the appellant raped her be stated in the prosecutrixs evidence in

this case. However, only on that factor, the charges would not fail if it

was apparent from the other evidence of the case that the appellant

raped her on the day specified in the charge.

Another important matter to be considered is that, according to PW-1,

she made a complaint to the police on 08.05.2010, the very next day

the alleged rape occurred. Her mother PW-2 also made a statement to

the police on the same day. In cross-examination, it was demonstrated

that neither PW-1 nor PW-2 had stated in their statements made on

08.05.2010 that the appellant raped PW-1 on the previous day. PW-5,

the woman sub-inspector of police who recorded the statements, also

stated that no incident of rape was disclosed by the statements of PW-

1 or PW-2 made on 08.05.2010.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General contended that since PW-1 was

mentally sub-normal, she may not have mentioned about this rape in

the statement made the next day. According to the medical report

marked P-1, PW-1 did not have features suggestive of a major

psychiatric disorder and she had only a mild learning disability. In the

circumstances, the question arises as to whether her mild learning

disability would prevent her from informing the police about the rape

that occurred the day before.

6

Be that as it may, in the circumstances where the prosecutrix was

unable to state the date of the offence relating to this case, the learned

State Counsel appeared in the High Court suggested that the second

statement in which it was disclosed for the first time that the appellant

had raped PW-1 on 07.05.2010 was made on 21.06.2010. So, the

alleged rape by the appellant has been disclosed 45 days after the

incident. The 45 day-delay in making a complaint is not the issue in

this case. A 45-day delay would not be an issue in a rape case if the

delay could be explained in an acceptable manner, because in rape

cases where the girl is under 16 years, there could be various reasons

why she or her parents are reluctant to make a complaint to the police.

In fact, in the instant action, there is no issue of delay in making a

complaint to the police. Without any delay, a complaint had been made

to the police the very next day after the incident. The issue here is that

there was no mention of rape or any other act committed by the

appellant on the previous day. If the alleged rape was committed on

07.05.2010, a reasonable doubt arises as to why nothing was

mentioned about the rape in the complaint made on 08.05.2010, the

very next day and it was disclosed after 45 days by making another

statement.

Apart from that, the other main issue to be considered is the PW-1s

credibility. It is to be noted that her mother PW-2 has stated that she

saw the appellant naked in the room with her daughter and thereafter

he went away. However, PW-2 has stated that she did not know whether

something had happened to her daughter because she had not seen

anything else. It was transpired in cross-examination that in PW-2s

statement to the police on 08.05.2010 also, she had not mentioned any

incident that occurred the previous day.

Therefore, the incidents relating to the charges based on the complaint

made by PW-1 after 45 days of the alleged incident have to be proved

on PW-1s evidence. The doctor who examined PW-1 after the incident

7

testified and formed his opinion that there is evidence of recent and

previous vaginal penetration and that the penetration could have

occurred on 07.05.2010. However, in proving charges against the

accused-appellant, it should be proved that the accused-appellant had

raped her on or about 07.05.2010. Since this is a charge of statutory

rape, PW-1s consent is immaterial, and proving the act of sexual

penetration by the appellant is sufficient to prove the second charge of

statutory rape.

The medical evidence supports to come to the conclusion that sexual

intercourse with PW-1 could have occurred on 07.05.2010. However, in

the case of Ajith v. Attorney General (2009) 1 Sri L.R. 23 it was held

that If the prosecutrix in a rape case is not a reliable or believable

witness, the evidence seeking to corroborate her story cannot

strengthen her evidence. Court should seek corroborative evidence only

if the prosecutrix is a reliable witness. Anyhow, proving the occurrence

of sexual intercourse is not sufficient to prove the charge of rape, but it

should also be proved that the appellant himself committed the rape.

At this stage, I wish to consider other judicial authorities where it was

observed the manner in which prosecutrixs evidence should be

assessed in deciding a charge of rape. It was held in Sunil and another

v. The Attorney General-(1986) 1 Sri L.R 230 that it is very dangerous

to act on the uncorroborated testimony of a women victim of a sex

offence but if her evidence is convincing such evidence could be acted

on even in the absence of corroboration.

In the Court of Appeal Case No. 129/2002 (H.C. Mathara No. 146/99)

decided on 28th June 2007 it was held Court can, however act on

uncorroborated testimony of a prosecutrix if her evidence appears to

the court to be completely satisfactory and there are attending

circumstances which make it safe for the Court to act upon her evidence

8

without corroboration. If I may put it in another way that is if her

evidence is capable of convincing the Court that she is speaking the

truth, Court can act on such testimony without corroboration.

Premasiri V. the Queen 77 NLR 85, it was held that in a charge of

rape, it is proper for a Jury to convict on uncorroborated evidence of

the complainant only when such evidence is of such a character as to

convince the Jury that she is speaking the truth.

As stated previously, apart from the medical evidence, there is no other

evidence to corroborate PW-1s testimony. However, the medical

evidence does not support determining who committed the rape. That

has to be decided on uncorroborated evidence of PW-1. It is to be noted

that there is no any obstacle to prove a rape charge on uncorroborated

evidence of the prosecutrix, if her evidence is cogent, as decided in the

aforesaid cases.

In considering the decisions of aforesaid judicial authorities, it is

apparent that in the instant action, PW-1s evidence should be credible

and cogent to prove the charges. The learned High Court Judge

accepted her evidence as credible and convicted the appellant for both

counts. The main argument of the learned counsel for the appellant was

that PW-1 repeatedly stated in her evidence that she fell fast asleep after

drinking the glass of water offered by the appellant and she could not

remember what had happened and only when the mobile phone rang

and her mother came, she woke up. Therefore, he contended that under

any circumstances, she was unable to explain the sexual acts

committed by the appellant that had been committed during her sleep.

Explaining all sexual acts in detail while saying that she fell fast asleep

after consuming water is improbable, false evidence, he contended.

Since it is apparent from this evidence that PW-1 is not a credible

witness, the learned counsel contended that the convictions are erred

in law.

9

The reply of the learned Deputy Solicitor General was that PW-1 has

not given false evidence but there may be an exaggeration. The

argument of the learned DSG was that the explanation of the sexual

acts is only an exaggeration and does not affect the credibility of PW-1.

Therefore, he contended that PW-1s evidence which was corroborated

by the medical evidence was sufficient to prove the charges beyond a

reasonable doubt.

On the day in question, around 9.30 p.m., she was sleeping in her room.

She suddenly woke up and observed the accused seated on her bed

next to her. She got frightened, and the accused offered her a cup of

water to drink. She had fallen fast asleep after drinking water. In her

testimony, PW-1 stated in the following manner that she couldnt

remember what happened afterwards:

.

. . .

.

.

(Page 148 of the appeal brief)

PW-1 stated the same thing repeatedly in her testimony, and the

relevant evidence can be found on pages 85, 151, and 152 of the appeal

brief.

On page 152, the question posed and the answer given by the PW-1 are

as follows:

:

?

: . .

PW-1 specifically stated that she could not remember anything after

falling asleep. According to her evidence, after consuming water, she

did not know what had happened, and when she woke up, she saw

10

some white substance on her thigh. Therefore, if the appellant had

raped her, it should have been committed during her sleep.

However, very strangely, PW-1 has described all the sexual acts

committed by the appellant in the following manner:

: ?

: .

: ?

: .

: .

: .

(Page 156 of the appeal brief)

On page 157 of the appeal brief also, PW-1 described the sexual acts in

detail, stating that the appellant inserted his penis into her vagina and

moved in and out three or four times. He had squeezed her mouth with

his hand and removed his penis just as she was about to scream from

pain. Furthermore, she stated that the appellant was with him for about

15 minutes and that she struggled but could not escape during that

time. It's obvious that the prosecutrix, who was fast asleep at that time,

couldn't feel the pain, couldn't tell how many times he inserted the

penis, couldn't tell how long he was with her, and couldn't struggle to

escape.

Again, on page 158 of the appeal brief, PW-1 has described further

details regarding the sexual act in the following manner:

: ?

: .

: ?

It is evident that if her version of falling fast asleep after drinking water

is accepted, she could not describe all of the sexual acts allegedly

committed by the appellant. If her evidence regarding sexual acts is to

be believed, her story of falling fast asleep after drinking water becomes

false. So, this is an improbability as well as a major discrepancy in

PW-1s evidence.

In the case of The Queen V.V.P. Julis and two others 65 NLR 505, the

following observations were made: Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus or

Falsum in uno falsum in omnibus, both forms are in use, (he who speaks

falsely on one point will speak falsely upon all) is a well-known maxim.

In applying this maxim, it must be remembered that all falsehood is not

deliberate. Errors of memory, faulty observation or lack of skill in

observation upon any point or points, exaggeration, or mere embroidery

or embellishment, must be distinguished from deliberate falsehood.

It was also observed in the said case that The maxim falsus in uno,

falsus in omnibus, is not an absolute rule which has to be applied

without exception in every case where a witness is shown to have given

false evidence on a material point. But when such evidence is given by

a witness, the question whether other portions of his evidence can be

accepted as true should not be resolved in his favour unless there is

some compelling reason for doing so.

12

Exaggeration must be distinguished from deliberate falsehood,

according to the decision of the aforementioned judicial authority. The

only issue now is whether PW-1's description of sexual acts is only an

exaggeration, as the learned DSG claims. According to the Oxford

dictionary, the meaning of exaggeration is that a statement that

represents something as better or worse than it really is. According to

the Cambridge dictionary the meaning of exaggeration is that to

make something seem larger, more important, better or worse than it

really is. So, it is apparent that in the instant action, PW-1 should see

or feel something to exaggerate in respect of the sexual acts. PW-1 could

not explain any sexual act committed by the appellant or feel anything

because she was fast asleep and could not remember or was unaware

of what had occurred according to her own evidence. She could have

exaggerated the sexual acts only if she was in a position to see and

remember the sexual acts committed by the appellant. When she

categorically stated that she could not remember anything after

drinking water and falling fast asleep, according to her own evidence

she was incapable to explain any sexual act occurred. Therefore, this is

certainly not an exaggeration but a serious improbability that directly

affects the credibility of the witness.

In such circumstances, her credibility cannot be considered as divisible

and accept one of the versions because if she could explain the sexual

acts, her entire story of falling fast asleep and being unable to remember

anything would become improbable, and if she fell asleep as she

repeatedly stated, she was unable to explain these sexual acts. In the

Indian case of Gurcharan Singh, V. State of Haryana - 1994 (2) Criminal

Law Journal - page 1710, it was held that Where the material witnesses

make inconsistent statements in their evidence on material particulars,

the evidence of such witnesses becomes unreliable and unworthy of

credence, thus making the prosecution case highly doubtful. PW-1s

13

evidence is not only improbable but also inconsistent as explained

above. It is vital to be noted that the inconsistency and improbability

have been occurred on the most important incidents in proving charges

of this case.

Therefore, I regret that I am unable to agree with the contention of the

learned DSG that the sexual acts she described were only an

exaggeration and those items of evidence do not affect the credibility of

PW-1. The said major inconsistencies as well as the significant

improbabilities have a direct impact on the credibility of PW-1's

evidence. Hence, her evidence cannot be considered as convincing and

the credibility of the prosecutrix is in question for the reasons explained

above. As stated in the aforesaid Court of Appeal Case No. 129/2002,

the prosecutrixs evidence should be completely satisfactory to act upon

but PW-1s evidence in this case, cannot be considered as satisfactory

evidence. In these circumstances, I am of the view that it is unsafe to

act upon the prosecutrixs evidence in this case. Hence, I hold that the

learned High Court Judges conclusion that the charge of statutory rape

has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt is erroneous.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the second count of statutory rape

has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The first count against

the appellant in terms of section 436 of the Penal Code is house

trespass in order to commit any offence punishable with imprisonment

for 10 years or more. The first count has been brought against the

appellant for house-trespass in order to commit the offence of rape.

Since the second charge of statutory rape fails, the first charge also

necessarily fails. Hence, I hold that the learned High Court judges

decision to convict the accused-appellant for counts one and two is bad

in law.

14

Accordingly, the judgment dated 16.10.2019, convictions, and

sentences are set aside. The accused-appellant is acquitted of the first

and second charges against him.

The appeal is allowed.
