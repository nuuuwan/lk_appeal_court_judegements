WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Panadura for

trafficking and possession of 2.56 grams of Heroin, on or about

01.02.2014, offences punishable under Section 54A(b) and 54A(d) of

the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by

Act No.13 of 1984. After trial, the learned High Court Judge of

Panadura convicted the accused-appellant on both counts by his

judgment dated 02.05.2019 and imposed life imprisonment for both

3

counts. This appeal has been preferred against the said convictions

and the sentences.

Prior to the hearing, written submissions were filed on behalf of both

parties. The learned Counsel for the appellant and the learned

Additional Solicitor General for the respondent made oral submissions

at the hearing of the appeal.

In brief, this is the prosecution story:

On 01st February 2014, upon receiving information from a reliable

informant about heroin is being packed for the purpose of trafficking,

PW-1, OIC of the Panadura-North vise squad, organized a team of

police officers for a raid and left the police station at 01.35 p.m., using

a private van traveling on the road. The driver of the van had dropped

the police officers about 25 meters away from Jana Udana

Gammana. Thereafter, they walked to the house where the raid was

carried out. As per the information given by the informant, they have

identified the wooden house where the heroin was being packed.

Thereafter, PW-1 had asked the other police officers to surround the

house while he was observing inside the house through a hole in the

wooden boards and had seen a person who was sitting on the bed

packing something into cellophane bags. PW-1 asked one of the

officers to knock at the door. However, the person who was inside got

frightened and said that he is suffering from tuberculosis.

Thereafter, on the instructions of PW-1, PC Senarath (PW-3) pushed

the door open, and both PW-1 and PW-3 went inside the house,

examined the packets, and identified the substance in the packets as

heroin. The accused- appellant had been arrested with 5 cellophane

bags containing 200 heroine packets.

The learned counsel for the appellant based his arguments on three

grounds of appeal.

1. The learned trial Judge has failed to realize that the prosecution

has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

2. The learned trial Judge has failed to appreciate the fact that

non-identification of the vehicle which was used for the raid and

its driver.

3. The learned trial Judge erred in law by failing to consider inter

se contradictions between the evidence of prosecution

witnesses.

The learned counsel for the appellant contended that all the raids

conducted by the police in Sri Lanka use vehicles belonging to the

police department, and thus using a van that was traveling on the

road for the raid is thoroughly unbelievable. I regret that I am unable

to agree with that contention because there are instances where

private vehicles are used for raids. In particular, when it is necessary

not to reveal that the police officers are going to conduct a raid,

private vehicles are used.

Next, I wish to consider the inter se contradiction shown by the

learned counsel in respect of the officers who went to the place of the

raid. He contended that the main investigating officer, PW-1, stated

that four police officers went to the appellants house, PW-3 stated

that all the police officers went to the appellants house but PW-5 took

a contradictory position and stated in his evidence that he was inside

the van during the raid.

PW-1 stated in his testimony that four police officers, including PW-5,

went on the raid and that PC 67091-Chathuranga later joined the

team. The van stopped 25 meters away from the house where the raid

was carried out. So, it is apparent that PW-5 has also gone to the

place of the raid with the other police officers. The only issue is

5

whether he got out of the van and joined the other police officers in

conducting the raid. When they went there, PW-1 directed the police

officers to surround the house, but PW-1 has not stated whether PW-5

was there with the other police officers at that time. When PW-3 was

questioned whether all the officers got down from the van, his answer

was that the driver was a civilian. (Page 130 of the appeal brief) So,

PW-3 has also not given a direct answer to that question. Hence, there

is no contradiction between PW-5s evidence and PW-1s evidence or

between PW-5s evidence and PW-3s evidence. In the circumstances,

PW-5s evidence that he remained in the van could be accepted

without any problem because no doubt arises on the said fact due to

the evidence of PW-1 or PW-3.

Be that as it may, when PW-5 was cross-examined, the defence

counsel suggested in the following manner that PW-5 came for the

raid, searched the garden, and since he did not make notes, he denied

getting down of the van.

(Page 200 of the appeal brief)

Therefore, even though the issue, whether PW-5 got down from the

van or remained in the van is considered as a contradiction, the said

contradiction has no effect because the appellant has admitted by

making the aforesaid suggestion that a team of police officers came to

his house and searched. In addition, the previous argument about the

improbability of using a private vehicle for the raid is also immaterial

because the vehicle they used to travel is relevant only to ensure

whether they in fact came to the appellants house for a raid. As the

6

appellant admits by the said suggestion that a team of police officers

came to his house for a raid, the vehicle that was used to reach the

place of the raid would not be an issue.

Another argument advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant

was that there was a possibility of implicating the appellant for the

heroin found in someone else's custody, especially because a body

search was not done even on the driver of the private van to ensure

that he did not possess any heroin. I regret that I am unable to accept

that argument because the defence of implicating the appellant for

heroin recovered from anybody else or introducing heroin to the

appellant was not taken by the appellant at any stage of the trial. The

learned counsel who appeared for the appellant in the High Court

made no suggestion to any of the prosecution witnesses of introducing

heroin or implicating the appellant for the heroin recovered from

someone else. Even in his dock statement, the appellant has not

stated that the heroin was introduced or that he was implicated for

the heroin recovered from someone else. At the hearing of the appeal,

the learned counsel for the appellant also admitted that the appellant

had not taken the said defence in the High Court trial. In the

circumstances, the learned High Court Judge was not obliged to

consider the issue of implication. Also, in the absence of any such

defence, I hold that the possibility of implication was not an issue to

be considered by the learned High Court Judge.

When PW-1 looked inside the house from the space between the

wooden boards, he saw the appellant sitting on the bed, packing

heroin into cellophane bags. When one of the police officers knocked

on the door, the appellant stated he was suffering from tuberculosis,

and then PC Senarath pushed the door open and went inside the

house. PW-1 stated that there were 5 cellophane bags containing 40

heroin packets each, when the police officers entered the house. The

learned counsel for the appellant pointed out a contradiction that

7

packing of heroin had been completed when they entered the house

according to PW-1, but according to PW-3, the appellant was putting

heroin packets in the shopping bags when they pushed open the door

and entered the house. In reply, the learned Additional Solicitor

General contended that packing of heroin means putting small

quantities of heroin in small bags and that packing was completed

according to both witnesses when the police officers entered the

house.

The said contradiction demonstrated by learned counsel for the

appellant could not be considered as a major contradiction. However,

there is a slight improbability in this story because, according to

PW-3, they had told the appellant that they were from the police

before entering the house. It is unlikely that the appellant was putting

the small bags into bulk cellophane bags even after they informed him

that they were from the police.

Charges against the appellant would not fail just because of the

reason that there is a slight improbability in the prosecution case. It

should be considered whether the said slight improbability casts

reasonable doubt on the prosecution case. PW-1 and PW-3 have given

evidence regarding the raid. Only one suggestion was made to PW-3

on behalf of the appellant. It has been suggested that

(Page 152 of the appeal

brief). It was not even suggested to PW-3 that the appellant did not

possess heroin or did not pack heroin. In fact, PW-3 specifically stated

in his testimony that he did not take any items from the appellant's

custody, and the chief investigating officer, PW-1, examined the heroin

packets, took those packets and suspicious items into custody, and

arrested the accused-appellant. So, obviously, PW-3 had not taken

heroin into custody from the appellant's house.

8

PW-1 was the officer leading this raid. PW-1 took the heroin into

custody and arrested the appellant. Therefore, if the appellant denies

being arrested while he was packing heroin, the same has to be

suggested to the PW-1. When PW-1 was cross-examined, only one

suggestion was made on behalf of the appellant. The suggestion was

that he witnessed the appellant packing heroin, is false.

(Page 118 of the appeal brief)

It was not even suggested that the appellant did not pack heroin.

Apart from that, there was no single suggestion made to PW-1 denying

the way police officers entered the house, the fact that productions

were recovered from the appellant's custody, or any other matter

relating to the raid. Even in his brief dock statement, the appellant did

not deny any allegation against him arising from the prosecution

evidence. He did not even deny the prosecution evidence about heroin

being packed in sachets. Hence, the prosecution evidence on the main

elements of the charges is unchallenged. In addition, the learned

defence counsel did not dispute the chain of production. The Indian

judgment of Sarvan Singh v. State of Punjab (2002 AIR SC (iii) 3652)

pages 3655 and 3656, was cited in the case of Ratnayake

Mudiyanselage Premachandra v. The Hon. Attorney General - C.A

Case No. 79/2011, decided on 04.04.2017 as follows:

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has

declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross-

examination, it must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue

ought to be accepted.

In the case of Himachal Pradesh v. Thakur Dass (1983) 2 Cri. L. J.

1694 at 1701 V.D Misra CJ held that whenever a statement of fact

9

made by a witness is not challenged in cross-examination, it has to be

concluded that the fact in question is not disputed. Similarly, in

Motilal v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1990) Criminal Law Journal NOC

125 MP it was held that Absence of cross-examination of prosecution

witness of certain facts, leads to inference of admission of that fact.

Therefore, in the instant action, the aforesaid slight improbability does

not cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case.

When the entire prosecution evidence as well as the aforesaid facts

impliedly admitted by the appellant are considered, I am of the view

that the two charges against the appellant have been proved beyond a

reasonable doubt. Hence, I hold that the learned High Court Judge is

correct in convicting the appellant of the two counts.

Accordingly, the judgment dated 02.05.2019, the convictions, and the

sentences are affirmed.

The appeal is dismissed.
