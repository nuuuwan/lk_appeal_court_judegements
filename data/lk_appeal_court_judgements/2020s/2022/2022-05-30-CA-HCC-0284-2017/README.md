Page 3 of 17

At the trial, the 1st and the 2nd accused has absconded the Court and the trial

has proceeded against them in absentia after following due procedure in terms

of section 241 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

After trial without a jury, the learned High Court Judge of Kegalle by his

judgment dated 03-10-2017 found all the accused including the appellant

guilty as charged, and they were sentenced to death on the 1st count and for a

period of 3 years rigorous imprisonment and for a fine on the 2nd count.

This is a matter where one eyewitness has given evidence as to the actual

incident, in addition to the several witnesses who has provided circumstantial

evidence. The eyewitness had been an accomplice to the crime, who has been

granted a conditional pardon in terms of section 256(1) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act by the Attorney General.

The relevant facts in brief: -

The deceased was the wife of the appellant who was pregnant at the time of her

death.

PW-01 Chandana Wijesuriya was the earlier mentioned accomplice who was

living in Deegala at the time relevant to the incident. On 4th July 1999 at about

2 p.m. a friend of him named Raja (2nd accused) has visited him and was asked

to accompany him to go to Awissawella. They have reached Awissawella at

around 3 p.m. in the motorbike ridden by the 2nd accused and they have been

met by a person called Kanna (3rd accused). After chatting for about half an

hour, they have gone to a restaurant in the town and had consumed beer and

arrack until about 6.30-7.00 in the evening. Thereafter, all three of them had

gone near the Daraniyagala bus stop and PW-01 had been instructed to get

into a bus plying towards Deraniyagala and was asked by the 2nd accused to

get down at the Warakathenna bus stop. The bus has reached the

Warakathenna bus stop around 7.45-8.00 in the night. The 2nd and the 3rd

accused had followed the bus in the motorbike. In the bus PW-01 has seen the

Page 4 of 17

1st accused, whom he came to know later as Chandrakumara and a pregnant

lady travelling with him. They too have alighted from the bus at the same bus

stop and he has seen them walking along the Derenaiyagala road.

The 2nd and the 3rd accused who followed the bus has stopped the bike and

PW-01 has been asked by the 2nd accused to get into the bike while the 3rd

accused started to follow the appellant and the pregnant lady about 10 feet

behind. When they reached the bridge on the road, the 2nd accused

accompanied by PW-01 has ridden the bike passing the couple and stopped.

Thereafter, the PW-01 has seen the couple followed by the 3rd accused turning

towards a by-road of about 5-6 feet wide which was along the waterway called

Kahanavita ela. He has also seen the 3rd accused Kanna carrying a black tulip

bag with him. At the insistence of the 2nd accused, he too has followed them.

He has then seen the 3rd accused taking a rope out of the bag he was carrying

and putting that around the neck of the female who was walking in front of

him and tightening it using force. Although the female has shouted for help the

appellant who was accompanying her has done nothing but just looked on. The

3rd accused has asked PW-01 also to assist him by pulling the rope but he has

let go the rope after initially assisting the 3rd accused.

Subsequently, the 3rd accused had stabbed the female using a knife he took

from the bag he was having in his possession to the neck of the victim. PW-01

has identified the knife which has been marked as P-01. It was the evidence of

the PW-01 that after he let go the rope, it was the appellant who got hold of it

and after the victim was stabbed, the appellant and the 3rd accused pushed her

to the embankment towards the waterway.

After the act, all four of them have met up near the bridge and Kanna has

shown a ring, two ear studs and a wrist watch as things found on the female.

The appellant has asked the 2nd accused to take them and the appellant has

Page 5 of 17

left with the 2nd accused in his motorbike as he was asked to be dropped off at

Dehiovita.

It was the position of the PW-01 that he was threatened with death if he

divulged to anyone the incident, and he made a confession before the

Magistrate of Ruwanwella after his arrest revealing what happened. It had been

his position that although it was dark, he was able to see what was happening

with the aid of moon light.

At the cross examination of the witness, the learned Counsel who represented

the appellant at the High Court has marked four contradictions where the

witness has admitted in his police statement that it was he who had the gold

jewellery of the victim and sold them later, but denied that he made such a

statement to the police when giving evidence in the Court. PW-01 has admitted

that he received money after the robbery.

At the trial, it had been the stance of the appellant that he was never at the

scene of the crime or involved, but it was the PW-01 and the other two accused

who misled an innocent woman, killed and robbed her.

PW-02 Jayasinghe was a person who had a boutique in the Awissawella town

and knew the appellant and his wife well. He has seen the appellant and his

wife at the Daraniyagala Bus stand on his way home around 7.00-7.30 in the

night of 4th July 1999, and had waved at them. On his way back to his

boutique where he used to spend the night at around 9.30 p.m. on the same

day, he has met the appellant again at Awissawella town and had informed

that his wife has gone missing. When questioned about seeing him with his

wife at the bus stand, he has not replied. Following day morning, the appellant

has come to the boutique and had requested the PW-02 to not to divulge to

anyone that he saw him with his wife. Although he has not taken much notice

of the request, once he came to know that a pregnant female has been found

Page 6 of 17

killed, he has realized the gravity of the request of the appellant and had

immediately informed the police what he knew.

Ruwanthi (PW-10) was the younger sister of the deceased who lived nearby to

the house of her. She has met the deceased on 4th afternoon and had informed

her that she is going to Awissawella to see Pandols that has been erected for

the Poson festival with her husband who was the appellant. Later she has come

to know of her death.

PW-09 Premakumara who has a tailoring shop in the town was the employer of

the appellant. On 5th July 1999 around noon, the appellant who came to the

shop has informed him that his wife has gone missing and had requested

money for him to conduct a Bhodi Puja. Later in the day he has come to know

about the killing of the wife of the appellant.

PW-12 Disna Nilanthi is a person who has developed a romantic relationship

with the appellant after meeting him about two months before the killing,

without knowing that he was a married man. They have exchanged several love

letters and photos among them. The appellant has even given a ring to her for

her birthday.

Sarath Jayaratne PW-15 was a bus conductor who used to work in a bus

plying from Awissawella to Deraniyagala. It has been his evidence that

although he could not remember the exact date, few days before he gave a

statement to the police, a pregnant female and another person travelled in his

bus and they got off at Warakathenna bus halt. It was his evidence that he

could remember this because of the fact that the female was pregnant and he

assisted her to get off from the bus. He was unable to remember whether

anyone else also got down at that stand as he has not paid any special

attention. He has identified a bus ticket shown to him (P-08) as a ticket issued

by him.

Page 7 of 17

Inspector of Police Lionel Weerasinghe was the main police investigator to the

incident. He has given evidence in detail regarding his investigations and

recovery of productions from the scene of the crime as well as based on the

statements of the accused persons. Apart from the other productions recovered

from the crime scene, he has also recovered two bus tickets issued for the

private bus No-61-2532, one of which has been marked as P-08 at the trial. It

was he who has recovered the knife used in the crime (P-01), based on the

statement made to the police by the 2nd accused in terms of section 27 of the

Evidence Ordinance and the gold jewellery belonging to the deceased from the

places where they were sold by the accused and the PW-01.

The doctor who conducted the postmortem of the deceased (PW-07) has

confirmed that the death of the deceased Monika Rasika Kumari Gunathilaka

was due to the shock following strangulation and cut injuries inflicted on her.

(Postmortem report marked P-22).

After the closure of the prosecution case leading other relevant additional

evidence and when called for a defence, the appellant has made a lengthy

statement from the dock. He has claimed that he was unaware of anything

about the murder of his wife and has claimed that PW-01s evidence was a total

falsehood. It was his position that he came to know that his wife has left home

for Awissawella saying that she is going to see Poson Pandols only after coming

home in that night. He has stated that he led a very peaceful married life with

his wife and had no reason to kill her, pleading that he is innocent.

Ground of Appeal: -

In her submissions before the Court, the learned Counsel for the appellant

raised the following ground of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

(1) When there were doubts in the prosecution evidence, the learned High

Court Judge without considering those doubts, has convicted the 1st

accused for robbery and murder.

Page 8 of 17

It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that PW-01 relied

on by the prosecution was not a reliable and trustworthy witness as he was an

accomplice to the crime. Making submissions that it was on the basis of the

evidence of PW-01 the appellant has been found guilty, it was her position such

a conviction was not safe given the unreliable nature of the evidence. It was

stated that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider material

contradictions marked as relevant and the fact that the appellant had no

motive to kill his wife with whom he had a happy married life. Claiming that it

was not probable for the appellant to kill his wife and take her jewellery, sell

them and share the money with the other accused, it was her contention that

the appellant was wrongly convicted and he should stand acquitted of the

charges.

It was the position of the learned Deputy solicitor General (DSG) on behalf of

the Attorney General that the case has been decided not only on the evidence

of the PW-01 who was an accomplice who was later given a conditional pardon

by the Attorney General, but on the circumstantial evidence as well.

Submitting that the evidence led in the action has clearly established that the

deceased was in the company of the appellant before her death, it was the

position of the learned DSG that although the appellant has made a lengthy

statement from the dock, he has failed to explain the most incriminating

evidence against him to the Court.

Contending that the learned High Court Judge has reached his verdict after

well considering the relevant legal provisions as to the value that can be

attached to the evidence of an accomplice as well as the circumstantial

evidence made available to the Court, it was his position that the conviction

and the sentence needs no disturbance and the appeal should stand

dismissed.

Page 9 of 17

Consideration of the Ground of Appeal

As argued correctly by the learned DSG, this is a matter that had been decided

based on the evidence of an accomplice to the crime as well as the available

circumstantial evidence and not only on the evidence of the accomplice as

claimed by the learned Counsel for the appellant.

I am in full agreement with the argument of the learned DSG that the learned

High Court Judge has well considered the relevant law as to the way the

evidence of an accomplice needs to be considered by a Court, before deciding to

accept the evidence of PW-01 as reliable.

In terms of section 133 of the Evidence Ordinance an accomplice shall be a

competent witness. The section 133 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as

follows;

133. An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused

person, and a conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds

upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.

However, when it comes to the presumptions a Court can reach in relation to

existence of certain facts in terms of section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance is

concerned, section 114 illustration (b) reads;

(b) that an accomplice is unworthy of credit, unless he is

corroborated in material particulars.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his book The Law of Evidence Volume 11

(Book-I) at 364 states thus;

For the purposes of section 114(b), it may be said that an accomplice is one

concern with another or others in the commission of the crime. Wharton on

Evidence, at page 12, states that;

Page 10 of 17

An accomplice is a person who knowingly, voluntarily with the common

intent with the principal offender units in the commission of a crime. The

term cannot be used in a loose or popular sense so as to embrace one who

has guilty knowledge or with morally delinquent or who was an admitted

participant in a related but distinct offence. To constitute an accomplice, he

must perform some act or take some part in the commission of the crime, or

owe some duty to the person in danger that makes it incumbent on him to

prevent its commission.

It is very much clear from the evidence adduced before the High Court that PW-

01 was an accomplice to the crime and therefore his evidence is subjected to

the scrutiny on the basis of that of an accomplice.

In the case of The Queen Vs. Liyanage (1965) 67 NLR 193 at 213 it was

held:

If an accomplice gives evidence under a conditional pardon, the

suspicion is aggravated, but it does not mean that his evidence should be

forthwith struck out, but that it should be considered carefully, and even

cautiously and only accepted when it is corroborated and found to be

convincing.

Held further;

In the case of accomplices, we have borne in mind the establish practice,

virtually equivalent to a rule of law. Which requires independent

corroboration of their evidence in material particulars, and qua each

defendant. Independent corroboration need not cover the whole

prosecution story, or even all the material particulars. The nature and

extent of corroboration required by the rule of prudence must, from the very

nature of things, vary with the circumstances of each case. What is

required is some additional evidence, direct or circumstantial, rendering it

probable that the accomplices evidence is true and reasonably safe to act

Page 11 of 17

upon, and connecting or rendering to connect the particular defendant with

the offence.

As considered rightly by the learned High Court Judge in the judgment, in the

case of Illanganthilaka and Others Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1984) 2

SLR 38, it was held:

(1) While it is legal to convict upon the uncorroborated evidence of an

accomplice, it is a rule of practice which has become virtually

equivalent to a rule of law to regard it as dangerous to so convict.

What is required is some additional evidence rendering it probable

that the story of the accomplice is true and it is reasonably safe to act

upon it.

(2) The corroboration must proceed from an independent source and it

must be weighed as to its probative value. It must confirm in some

material particular not only that the crime has been committed but

also that the accused committed it. The corroboration need not extend

to the whole story not need it be by direct evidence that the accused

committed the crime; it is sufficient if the evidence is merely

circumstantial.

With the above legal principles in mind, the learned High Court Judge has

considered whether the evidence of PW-01, who was the accomplice can be

considered credible and whether his evidence has been sufficiently

corroborated.

PW-01s evidence that he travelled in the bus where the deceased and the

appellant also travelled has been well corroborated by the evidence of several

witnesses. PW-02 has seen the appellant with his pregnant wife who is the

deceased moments before the relevant time where PW-01 says they travelled in

the bus. The conductor of the bus which travelled towards Deraniyagala at the

time and the day relevant to the incident, (PW-15) has given uncontradicted

Page 12 of 17

evidence that he remembers a pregnant lady and another person travelling in

his bus and getting down at the Warakathenna bus halt. The sister of the

deceased has given evidence in this action to confirm that her sister left the

home saying that she is going to Awissawella to see pandols with the appellant.

The evidence confirms that it was with the appellant his wife was last seen

alive on that night.

The evidence of the Medical Officer who conducted the postmortem perfectly

tallies with the evidence of PW-01 as to the way the deceased was strangulated

and later stabbed with a knife. I am of the view that these pieces of evidence

when taken together corroborates the evidence of PW-01 and establishes that

he was speaking the truth as to what happened on that fateful day, although

he was an accomplice to the crime. The contradictions marked in relation to

the statement he made to the police and the evidence in the Court are not

material contradictions in my view. All the contradictions are in relation to how

the robbed items were taken over and sold, which does not affect the credibility

of the witness as to the actual incident where the deceased was killed. Hence, I

am in no position to agree with the contention that PW-01 was not a credible

witness and his evidence should be disregarded.

In the case of P. Sarawanamuththu Vs. R. A. De Mel (1948) 49 NLR 529, it

was stated that;

The corroboration of the evidence of an accomplice need not extend as

regards the whole story told by him. It is suffice if the accomplice is

corroborated on one or more material particulars as regards the person lie

implicated.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has well considered his evidence and

only after satisfying that there was sufficient corroboration of the evidence of

PW-01 has decided to accept his evidence, for which I find no reason to

interfere with.

Page 13 of 17

Apart from the evidence of PW-01, I find that several other witnesses have

provided circumstantial evidence that points the finger directly at the appellant

for the crime. Although he has pleaded that he never met his wife on that day,

and only came to know that she left the house when he came home for the

night, evidence of the PW-02 Jayasinghe was that he saw and waved at the

appellant and his wife who were at the Daraniyagala bus stand on that night. It

was also his evidence that around 9.00-9.30 p.m. on the same night he met the

appellant again in the town and he informed him that his wife has gone

missing, for which the witness has questioned the appellant that wasnt she

with you when I saw you earlier in the town. The appellant has failed to provide

any answer to that question. On the following day morning the appellant has

visited the PW-02 again and had requested him to not to tell anybody that he

saw the deceased and himself together.

I find that the appellant has failed to contradict the credibility of the evidence

of PW-02 on these material points in any manner. Although a contradiction (V-

05) has been marked, I find that it was not a contradiction that can be

relevant. It is abundantly clear that the witness has forgotten a minute detail of

the events that unfolded on that day due to the passage of time. In his evidence

before the Court, he has stated that what was stated by the appellant was that

Aiye you are the only one who saw yesterday, do not tell anyone. In the police

statement what has been stated by the witness was that Mangala aiye, you

are the only one who saw me at the Daraniyagala bus stand, which explains

itself.

Under our law, an accused person has nothing to prove and it is the

responsibility of the prosecution to prove the case beyond doubt. An accused

only needs to create a reasonable doubt on evidence against him and offer a

reasonable explanation.

In the case of Pantis Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 148, it was

held;

Page 14 of 17

As the burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove its case

beyond reasonable doubt and no such duty is cast on the accused and it is

sufficient for the accused to give an explanation which satisfies the Court

or at least is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.

However, it is also our law that when a strong prime facie case has been

established against an accused and there is evidence that only he can explain,

it is the duty of the accused to provide a reasonable explanation as to the

highly incriminating evidence against him.

In the case of Sumanasena Vs. The Attorney General (1999) 3 SLR 137, It

was held:

When the prosecution establishes a strong and incriminating cogent

evidence against the accused, in those circumstances was required in law

to offer an explanation of the highly incriminating circumstances

established against him.

Although there is much discussion among legal luminaries that whether such a

judgment existed or reported, it is now embedded into our legal principles what

the judges often referred to as the Ellenborough dictum.

It is stated that in the case of Rex Vs. Lord Cochrane and others (1814)

Gurneys Reports 479 Lord Ellenborough held:

no person accused of crime is not bound to offer any explanation of his

conduct or of circumstances of suspicion which attached to him; but,

nevertheless, if he refuses to do so, where a strong prima facie case has

been made out and when it is in his own power to offer evidence if such

exists, in explanation of such suspicious circumstances which would show

them to be fallacious and explicable consistently with his innocence it is a

reasonable and justifiable conclusion he refrains from doing so only from

the conviction that the evidence so suppressed or not adduced would

operate adversely to his interest.

Page 15 of 17

Abott J. in Rex Vs. Burdett (1820) B & Ald 161 at 162 observed that:

No person is to be required to explain or contradict until enough has been

proved to warrant a reasonable and just conclusion against him, in the

absence of explanation to contradiction; but when such proof has been

given, and the nature of the case is such as to admit of explanation or

contradiction, if the conclusion to it the prima facie case tends to be true

and the accused offers no explanation or contradiction, can human reason

do otherwise than adopt the conclusion to which proof tends.

Although the appellant has made a lengthy statement from the dock, he has

failed to offer any explanation as to the evidence of PW-02 who saw and met

him and his wife on the day of the incident. The evidence of PW-02 cut across

the stand taken by the appellant in his dock statement that he never knew that

his wife left the house in that evening, until he came home at that night. If it

was the stand of the appellant he has failed to cross-examine and confront the

PW-02 at the trial. Besides that, PW-09 who was the employer of the appellant

has given evidence and had stated that the appellant left his tailoring shop at

around 5.00-5.30 in the evening of that day, which was contrary to the stand

of the appellant that he left the shop at around 7.00 p.m. that day in order to

go home. However, the appellant has failed to cross-examine the witness on

that fact either.

In the case of Sarwansingh Vs. State of Punjab (2002) AIR Supreme Court

(iii) 3652 at 3655 the Indian supreme court held thus:

It is a rule of essential justice whenever the opponent has declined to

avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross examination it must

follow that the evidence tendered on this issue ought to be accepted

In the case of State of Himachalpradesh Vs. Thakur Dass (1983) 2 Criminal

Law Journal 1694 at 1701 V D Visva C.J held:

Page 16 of 17

Whenever a statement of fact made by a witness is not challenged in

cross examination it must be concluded that the fact in question is not

disputed

When it comes to the question whether the common intention has been

established in this matter, the evidence of PW-01 provides clear insight as to

the part played by the appellant along with the other perpetrators of the crime.

I find that the prosecution has established by way of direct and circumstantial

evidence the common intention of each of the accused in pursuance of the

crime beyond reasonable doubt.

In the case of King Vs. Assappu 50 NLR 324 it was held that:

In a case where the question of common intention arises the Jury must be

directed that;

(1) The case of each accused must be considered separately.

(2) The accused must have been actuated by a common intention with the

doer of the act at the time the offence was committed.

(3) Common intention must not be confused with the same or similar intention

entertained independently of each other.

(4) There must be evidence, either direct or circumstantial, of prearrangement

or some other evidence of common intention.

(5) The mere fact of the presence of the accused at the time of the offence is

not necessarily evidence of common intention.

In this action, the prosecution has led evidence to establish the possible motive

for the crime. According to the evidence of PW-12, Disna Nilanthi, the appellant

has developed a love affair with her, pretending that he is unmarried. The

evidence led in this action has clearly established that this was the motive for

the appellant to brutally kill his pregnant wife and get rid of her with the help

of the other accused.

Page 17 of 17

In a criminal case there is no need for the prosecution to establish a particular

motive for a crime in order to prove a charge against an accused. However,

once the motive is established as in the case under appeal, it strengthens

further, the case of the prosecution.

In the case of Sumanasena Vs. The Attorney General (supra) it was held:

Although the prosecution is not bound to establish a motive, once cogent

and intelligible motive has been established, that fact considerably

advances and strengthens the prosecution case.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has considered the evidence in its

totality, as he should have, in relation to the direct as well as the

circumstantial evidence against the appellant and the other accused in this

action. In his judgment the learned High Court Judge has well considered the

facts as well as the relevant law before finding the appellant guilty as charged,

for which I find no reasons to interfere with.

The appeal therefore is dismissed, as I find no merit in the appeal. The

conviction and the sentenced affirmed.
