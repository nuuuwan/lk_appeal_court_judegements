Judgment

This appeal emanates from the Order of the learned High Court Judge of Kegalle, dismissing the

application for revision made by the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant in Case bearing No.

PHC/Kegalle/Rev 5006.

It appears that the Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent instituted action bearing No. 34420 in the

Magistrate Court of Kegalle by filing an information in terms of Section 66(1) (b) of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, on the basis that there was a dispute on the usage of a

roadway, which caused the breach of the peace between the Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent

[hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Respondent] and the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant

[hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant].

Page 3 of 9

After supporting the application by the Respondent, Court issued notice on the Appellant.

Thereafter, both parties filed their respective affidavits and counter affidavits. After the conclusion

of the inquiry, the learned Magistrate acting as the Primary Court Judge delivered the Order on

08.01.2016 deciding that the Respondent was entitled to the roadway in dispute and ordered to

remove all obstructions to the respondents access.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the Primary Court Judge, the Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court of Kegalle to revise the said

Order. However, after making oral submissions and tendering written submissions by both parties,

the learned High Court Judge dismissed the application of the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant by

Order dated 23.11.2017.

Admittedly, the Appellant and the Respondent are co-owners to the premises in dispute and the

Appellant had instituted a partition action bearing No. 28904/P in the District Court of Kegalle

making the Respondent as a Defendant.

As such, it was submitted by the Respondent that since the Respondent is a co-owner to the

premises in dispute thus she is entitled to an undivided portion of land including soil rights to the

disputed roadway.

Hence, the Appellant has no right to obstruct the Respondents right of way which was used in

common by both of them.

The Appellant has constructed a gate at the entry to the roadway promising to handover a key to

the Respondent. When the Appellant failed to do so, the dispute arose effectively shutting out the

Respondent from entering the portion of land occupied by the Respondent.

Apparently, the Appellant had taken up a different position that the disputed roadway is a private

roadway acquired by the Appellant and his predecessors through an adjoining land for their own

private use.

Page 4 of 9

According to the statement made by the Appellant, the roadway leading to his residence was only

used by him and the actual access to the land was from the other side of the land and that was the

access used by the Respondent to gain access to the premises occupied by her.

On behalf of the Appellant, it was submitted that a partition action bearing No. 28904/P is pending

in the District Court of Kegalle in respect of the premises in dispute, where the preliminary plan

too had been prepared.

It was further submitted that the Respondent was present before the surveyor at the preliminary

survey but the Respondent had not claimed any right of way over the disputed roadway nor had

she preferred any counter claim when the appellant claimed that the said roadway was exclusively

a road to access his portion of land.

Moreover, the Appellant submitted that since the District Court action was pending at the time the

dispute arose between the parties, the Respondent could not have maintained the instant action and

also the learned Magistrate could not have assumed jurisdiction to hear and determine the said

Case.

On this premise, it was the position taken up by the Appellant that the said Order in terms of

Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act is made until such time a Court with competent

civil jurisdiction makes a final Order in relation to a civil dispute between the parties in order to

prevent a breach of the peace.

Since there was already a civil action pending in the District Court at the time of instituting

proceedings under Chapter VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, the Respondent was not

without recourse to obtain any relief from that Court which has jurisdiction to grant suitable relief.

The attention of Court was drawn to the following Case law in view of the aforesaid submissions

made by and on behalf of the Appellant;

In Kanagasabai Vs. Mylvaganam 78 N.L.R 280 at 284 - Sharvananda J. as his Lordships then

was held,

Page 5 of 9

As stated earlier, the mere pendency of a suit in a civil Court is an irrelevant

circumstance for the Magistrate to take into consideration when making an order

under Section 62 and 63 of the Administration of Justice Law. His primary function

is to maintain Law and order. If the mere institution of a suit in a civil Court is

sufficient to divest the Magistrate of his jurisdiction, the whole purpose of Section

62 will be defeated. A scheming party will be enabled to play hide and seek.

In the said Judgment, his Lordship quoted with approval (at page 282) the Judgment in the Indian

Case of Imambu Vs. Hussenbi AIR 1960 Mys 203 as follows;

But the mere pendency of a suit in a civil Court is wholly an irrelevant circumstance.

That does not take away the dispute which had necessitated a proceeding under

Section 145 Criminal Procedure Code. The possibility of a breach of peace would

still continue. If the mere institution of a suit in a civil Court is sufficient to deprive

the Magistrate of his jurisdiction, anomalous results might follow.

In the case of Mutha Merenngya Keerthi Rohan Vs. Koralage Upali Senarath CS (PHC) 25/2014

decided on 24.06.2016, where Walgama J. held,

It is intensely relevant to note that the mere fact, a civil action is pending in the

District Court, will not fetter a Magistrate to make any Order in respect of an

application filed under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

Furthermore, it was submitted on behalf of the Appellant by the time the dispute arose between

the parties, the Respondent had already filed her statement of claim in the said partition action.

Nevertheless, in her statement of claim she had not claimed any right over the disputed road way

nor had she claimed any such right before the surveyor at the preliminary survey.

It is worthy to note that the Respondent had filed the statement of claim in the partition action on

3rd December 2013 and in her counter affidavit filed at the Primary Court, it was clearly stated that

the said preliminary survey was done on 4th August 2014 whilst the obstruction to her access by

the Appellant was on or about 4th August 2015. Hence, it appears that the said submission on behalf

of the Appellant is without merit.

Page 6 of 9

It is interesting to note that the learned Magistrate has very correctly held that,

.

.

Apparently, the Law is well settled in this respect that there is no restriction to maintain an action

under Part VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act even though there is a civil action pending in

the District Court. As such, the aforesaid submission of the appellant is untenable in Law.

It was the contention of the Respondent that the Appellant being the Plaintiff in the partition action

had admitted the fact that the Respondent too is a co-owner to the land in suit thus he could not

have prevented another co-owner from using the right of access to the main land.

However, the Appellant contended the said position of the Respondent and had taken up the

position that the disputed roadway is a private roadway acquired by the Appellant and his

predecessors through an adjoining land for their own private use at the time when the proper means

of access was from the eastern boundary of the land.

As such, the respondent could not claim any right over a private access way when there is a separate

access to the land for the mere reason that she is a co-owner to the land to which such access is

provided.

On the contrary, the Respondent has clearly stated in her affidavits that the Appellant had

attempted to show the investigating officer a marshy land to the alternative roadway available to

the Respondent. 9.

Similarly, the Respondent had stated in her counter affidavit that 14.

.

In these circumstances, it is the duty of Court to look into the matter and decide which party

substantiated their respective positions at the inquiry and whose version is plausible to accept in

determining the real issue.

According to the Appellant, the disputed roadway was only used by the Appellant, and it was never

used by the Respondent.

It is observable that the disputed right of way was clearly indicated in the sketch made by the

investigating police officer marked and produced as -3.

It is seen that the disputed right of way was clearly indicated by marking as G in the sketch [-

3] and stated .

It is to be noted that the investigating officer has further stated that the Newly constructed gate

was present at the entry to the land and the same was causing an obstruction to use the said right

of way.

Therefore it clearly shows that the Appellant could not substantiate his contention that the

Respondent never used the road which was depicted in the sketch [-3] as G. It was only used

Page 8 of 9

by the Appellant, and it was not proved that the Respondent used a private road or Respondent had

alternative access road to the premises occupied by her.

Apparently, the learned Magistrate has accepted the said evidence and has held that the Respondent

is entitled to the impugned roadway and ordered the Appellant to remove all obstructions to the

Respondents access in terms of Section 69 (1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

The learned High Court Judge held that the Appellant had not adduced any exceptional

circumstances for Court to exercise revisionary Jurisdiction.

It is noteworthy that the learned High Court Judge, analysed and evaluated the evidence placed

before the learned Magistrate by both parties and also the findings of the learned Magistrate and

held that the Appellant has not shown the existence of exceptional circumstances warranting the

exercise of revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court and dismissed the application of the

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant, affirming the Order of the learned Magistrate.

It appears that the learned counsel for the Respondent had raised an objection in this appeal that

the Appellant had failed to adduce any exceptional circumstances, which would warrant the

intervention of the Provincial High Court by way of an application for revision.

In this respect it was submitted by the learned counsel for the Appellant that its well settled Law

that when a right of appeal of a party has been expressly taken away by statute, the only remedy

available to an aggrieved party is to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of a superior Court and

under the said circumstances, it is not a requirement for such party to establish exceptional

circumstances. Establishing exceptional circumstances in a revision application will only apply in

cases where a party fails to exercise his statutory right of appeal but seeks redress from a superior

Court by way of revision. Under the said circumstances, a party is required to show as to why the

Court should exercise its discretion to grant relief by way of revision at a time when there was a

statutory right of appeal available to such party.

Page 9 of 9

But when a right of appeal has been expressly taken away from a party by statute, an aggrieved

party only has to satisfy Court that there are questions of Law to be determined by the appellate

Court and the illegality of the impugned Order. This legal principle is clearly laid down in the Case

of C.A Jayatillaka Vs. R.M.M. Ratnayaka CA (PHC) Appeal No. 82/97 C.A Minutes of

24.10.2007.

Apparently, the said Judgment reported in 2007(1) S.L.R 299 held;

(i) That the appellant alleged that the application to the Magistrates' Court was defective

as it contains the wrong district namely 'Kandy' instead of 'Nuwara-Eliya'.

(ii) That the name and address of the appellant were not mentioned.

(iii) That the application refers to a wrong plan.

In view of the aforesaid Judgment, the Appellant has to show illegality or some procedural

impropriety in the impugned Order made by the learned High Court Judge.

Nevertheless, the Counsel for the Appellant had not shown any impropriety, procedural defect or

illegality in the impugned Order of the learned high Court Judge dated 23.11.2017.

Therefore, we see no reason to interfere with the said Order of the learned high Court Judge and

the Order dated 08.01.2016 by the learned Magistrate and dismiss this appeal with costs filed at

Rs. 35,000/-.

Appeal dismissed.
