This is a revision application filed by the suspect-petitioner (hereinafter the petitioner)

to set aside the order of the Magistrate Court of Balangoda dated 22.12.2021 which

refused to discharge the suspect under Section 120(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code

(hereinafter the CPC) based on a preliminary objection raised by the petitioner The

parties agreed to proceed with one judgment for both MCR 01/22 and MCR 02/22,

therefore the present judgment is applicable to both the cases.

The facts of the case are briefly as follows. The petitioner along with the suspect

respondent, his wife are Directors of the Horamulla Tea Plantation (Pvt) Ltd. The virtual

complainant is a tea supplier. He lodged a complaint on 17.03.2020 before the Special

Crime Investigation Unit of Rathnapura Police on the failure of the said company to pay

him the money in arrears for the tea leaves he has supplied them. The virtual

complainant has supplied tea to the said company since 2018, January. However, this

case is concerned with regard to the most recent transaction in a consistent chain of

4

CA-MCR-0001-22 Page 4 of 14 14/12/2022 IJ-56-22

transactions, where the company has failed to pay a due amount of Rs. 3,771,890/= for

the supplied tea leaves. Consequentially, the police reports suggested that there exists

a criminal liability punishable under Sections 403, 386 and 389 of the Penal Code

against the petitioner and the suspect respondent.

The petitioner invoked the revisionary jurisdiction under Article 138 of the Constitution

read together with Sections 364 and 368 of the CPC to set aside the said order and grant

lawful relief based on the grounds that the learned Magistrate has misconceived the law

under Section 120(3) and Section 186 of the CPC by refusing to discharge the petitioner.

Therefore, Counsel for the petitioner avers the following exceptional circumstances to

invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court by way of revision to set aside the

Magistrates Court order.

1. The order of the learned Magistrate is a miscarriage of justice detrimental to the

freedom and liberties of the petitioner as the learned Magistrate has not

judiciously exercised the judicial discretion bestowed under Section 120 (3).

2. The Court is misdirected in understanding the difference between civil liability

and criminal liability.

3. The investigation is tainted with illegality as the police has failed to report the

petitioners statement to the Magistrate and the learned Magistrate has

overlooked this fact.

Hence, the instant application pivots on the interpretation of Section 120(3) of the CPC

and assessing whether the learned Magistrates refusal to discharge the suspects is

misconceived in law.

Impugned order

The impugned order contends that by reason of a charge sheet been framed (which was

later amended), the petitioner is prevented from invoking Section 120(3) of the CPC:

120(3)

.

5

CA-MCR-0001-22 Page 5 of 14 14/12/2022 IJ-56-22

. (Page 8 of the order at page 119 of the Appeal

Brief)

Similarly, the learned Magistrate contends as follows:

"

. .. 1

, ,

186 .

120(3)

.

120(3) . (Page 4 of the Order

at page 115 of the Appeal Brief) (Emphasis added)

Hence the main reason for the learned Magistrate to refuse the discharge of the

petitioner is the fact that the complainant has framed charges in light of the

investigation conducted into the complaint. Therefore, it is the contention of the learned

Magistrate that Section 120(3) of the CPC cannot be triggered in the instant case. At

this juncture, it is pertinent to examine Section 120(3) of the CPC.

Section 120(3) of the CPC

Section 120(3) of the CPC empowers the Magistrate to discharge a suspect based on the

completed investigation into a complaint. The Section reads as follows:

As soon as the investigation is completed the officer in charge of the police station

6

CA-MCR-0001-22 Page 6 of 14 14/12/2022 IJ-56-22

shall forward to such court a report in the prescribed form. If in the report there is

no allegation that the suspect has committed or been concerned in the committing

of any offence the Magistrate shall discharge him. If the report alleges that the

suspect has committed or been concerned in committing an offence he shall be

prosecuted in accordance with the provisions of this Code.

It must be noted that the application of Section 120(3) is informed by its preceding

Sections which reflects the continuous sequence of formulations within the CPC. Hence

Section 120(3) must be read within its context where it is placed under Chapter XI of

the CPC titled Information to Police Officers and Inquiries and Their Powers to

Investigate contained in Part V of the CPC titled Investigation of Offences. It is

significant to note that, with the exception of Section 115 which deals with a specific

circumstance, Section 120(3) is the first time the CPC recognizes the power of a

Magistrate to intervene during or at the conclusion of an investigation under Chapter

IX. This further reinforces the contemplation by drafters that Section 120(3) ought not

to be read in a vacuum.

As such, it must be noted that prior to a Magistrate discharging a suspect under Section

120(3) of the CPC, Section 114 of the CPC provides for the release of a person under

investigation from custody (upon a bond) on the basis of deficient evidence. As such,

the threshold for such release is stipulated as it appearsthat there is not

sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion to justify the forwarding of the

accused to a Magistrates Court. While such release is not akin to a discharge by the

Magistrate as envisioned in Section 120(3) (under Section 114, the person is released

upon executing a bond or released under the direction to appear when so required before

a Magistrate), the threshold requirement of sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of

suspicion points to the context in which Section 120 of the CPC must be evaluated.

This contention is further reinforced by Section 116 of the CPC which stipulates another

threshold requirement for an officer or inquirer to forward a case to a Magistrates

Court if sufficient information is well founded or if further investigation is necessary.

Therefore, even before a completed investigation arrives at Section 120, the CPC

delineate a criterion of sufficiency. Bearing this context in mind, we now turn to examine

Section 120(3) of the CPC.

7

CA-MCR-0001-22 Page 7 of 14 14/12/2022 IJ-56-22

The wording of Section 120(3) clearly points to the role of the presiding judge in

assessing a threshold question on whether the material placed before him warrants the

discharge of the suspect against whom an investigation has been completed pursuant

to a complaint. This would serve the dual purpose of ensuring the rights of the suspect

(yet to be named as an accused) as well as filtering out those cases which have a lower

likelihood of conviction at the very preliminary stage of a would-be prosecution. Within

the ambit of such a filtering purpose, is the notion that while a Magistrate is not

expected to conduct a trial before a trial, he must nevertheless assess the existence of

sufficient evidence in determining whether a suspect ought to be discharged or not. In

doing so, the presiding judge must apply their mind to the material revealed during the

investigation and make a reasonable, independent assessment on whether or not the

threshold requirement is met within the context of Section 120(3), bearing in mind the

implications of Sections 114 and 116 of the CPC. This is ever so important as Section

120(3) of the CPC is the first time a Magistrate is called upon to evaluate the assessment

of the investigating officer that the complaint against the suspect warrants the case to

proceed before the Magistrates Court.

This assessment does not include, as rightly pointed out in the above quote, an

evaluation of the elements of the crime, the actus reus and the mens rea of the suspect.

That is a task reserved for the trial judge. What it does include is an exercise of discretion

in deciding whether a prima facie case has been presented, which involves an

independent assessment of the material divulged during the investigation. This

requirement cannot be relegated to a mechanical act of rubber stamping the

investigators conclusion. It involves the use of discretion by a Magistrate, independent

of what the investigator contends. If not, a Magistrate will be diminishing their own

discretion to a mere mechanical assent of what the investigators have concluded.

Application of Section 120(3) of the CPC

As quoted above, the learned Magistrate in his impugned Order places a heavy reliance

on the conclusion made by the complainant-respondent (hereinafter the complainant).

He concludes that based on the material disclosed during the investigation, charges can

be maintained against the petitioners and that charges have been framed accordingly.

8

CA-MCR-0001-22 Page 8 of 14 14/12/2022 IJ-56-22

However, what is absent in the analysis is any independent reference to the materials

thus disclosed during the investigation. Reiterating the submissions made by both

parties is the first step in the exercise of the judicial discretion, but a judge should not

stop there. There must be some evidence that the judicial mind was applied to the facts

and law, independent of the submissions made by the parties.

Nevertheless, it must be borne in mind that when applying the judicial mind to the facts

and circumstances, the degree of evaluation during the Section 120(3) stage of a case

is not the same as the degree of evaluation at a later stage- such as the trial. At the

stage where Section 120(3) of the CPC, the discretion is utilized to assess a threshold of

sufficiency and not the threshold of beyond reasonable doubt. The minimum standard

of discretion to be used at Section 120(3) stage must be accompanied by evidence of an

independent assessment which goes beyond the restatement of what the parties

submissions. Framing of a charge does not, ipso facto, prevent the triggering of Section

120(3). The contrary would mean that the discretion of a Magistrate to discharge the

suspects under Section 120(3) of the CPC is disallowed the moment a charge sheet has

been framed. Ordinarily, a Magistrate does not frame the charges. Instead, the draft

charges tendered by the prosecution will be accepted by the Magistrate and the same

will be perceived as the charges framed by the Magistrate himself. This view has been

endorsed in CA PHC 108/2010 CA minute dated 26.08.2014. However, the acceptance

by the Magistrate in the said instance is not a mechanical act of rubber stamping the

prosecutions draft, it involves a judicious exercise of discretion. After such an exercise

and the charge sheet framed, by reason of it being considered as framed by the

Magistrate, then an option of discharge under Section 120(3) of the CPC will no longer

be available. Therefore the reference in Section 120(3) to If in the report there is no

allegation that the suspect has committed or been concerned in the committing of any

offence and If the report alleges that the suspect has committed or been concerned in

committing an offence he shall be prosecuted in accordance with the provisions of this

Code is a reference to the threshold of whether the Magistrate is satisfied with the

commission of an offence with a prima facie prospect of securing a conviction. To that

end, the Magistrate must make an independent assessment whether the draft charges

presented by the prosecution has any merit in it. He ought not to act as a mere rubber

stamp.

9

CA-MCR-0001-22 Page 9 of 14 14/12/2022 IJ-56-22

The unacceptability of a contrary interpretation of Section 120(3) of the CPC is further

reinforced by the later formulation of Section 186 in the CPC which empowers the

Magistrate to discharge a suspect at any time. This section in furtherance to an

individuals right to personal liberty and freedom. Every individual is entitled to be free

from arbitrary detention or prosecution in any instance where the commission of a crime

cannot be sufficiently ascertained through investigations. Thus, it is within the power

of a Magistrate to discharge such suspects, in order to uphold their rights.

In this regard, this Court would like to echo the words of his Lordship Justice

Gunawardana in Abdul Sameem v The Bribery Commissioner (1991) 1 S.L.R.

Furthermore, whilst appreciating the pressures on time and the large volume of work the

Magistrates Courts are called upon to handle, it is nevertheless important, that rights of

an accused person are safeguarded and that he be brought to trial according to accepted

fundamental principles of criminal procedure

As discussed at the outset, under Chapter XI of the CPC, there are several threshold

requirements for a complaint to proceed within the stipulated sequence of investigation.

For instance, the investigating officer must be satisfied of sufficient evidence or

reasonable grounds of suspicion to justify the forwarding of a suspect to the

Magistrates Court (Section 114 and 116 of the CPC). When such a suspect is brought

before a Magistrate to consider whether he or she ought to be discharged under section

120(3) of the CPC, it is implied that the Magistrate should use his discretion in a

judicious manner to assess whether the threshold requirement has been met and

whether there is prima facie case against the suspect.

In light of this, it is the considered view of this Court that the impugned order of the

learned Magistrate has failed to satisfy this burden envisioned under Section 120(3) of

the CPC. A mere statement such as

120(3)

. (supra), without an independent review

of the material divulged by the completed investigation, amounts to relegation of the

discretion envisioned by the framers of the CPC. On the other hand, the framing of the

charge/s and amending it as necessary is a duty of a Magistrate. As His Lordship

10

CA-MCR-0001-22 Page 10 of 14 14/12/2022 IJ-56-22

Justice Salam (P/CA) echoed in CA/PHC/108/2010 (Supra) at page 6 of the judgment-

It is a magisterial duty which cannot be delegated to the police. Whether there is sufficient

ground to proceed against the suspect in the hands of a judicial officer who is expected to

address his mind judiciously. If the duty of framing the charge is to be entrusted others

the purposive approach to Section 182 will be rendered nugatory.

Hence, this Court opines that the impugned order is misconceived in law as the learned

Magistrate has failed to take into consideration the lack of material in the submitted

reports supporting the commission of the alleged crime by the suspect. This will be

discussed in detail in the next segment.

Threshold requirement unmet

It must be noted that Magistrates are not routinely required to evaluate material

divulged at the completion of an investigation against the threshold of sufficiency and

reasonableness. The special circumstance of the instant case is that the petitioner has

raised a preliminary objection based on Section 120(3) of the CPC. In such an instance,

it is the duty of the Magistrate to employ his discretion and make an inquiry into the

threshold criterion. It is within the interest of justice to conduct such an inquiry before

the charges are formally read against the suspect. Therefore, it can be noted that the

petitioner has raised the preliminary objections well within the correct time period,

before charges are formally read against him. In this instant case charges have not been

formally read over against the petitioner and the summons have not yet been served on

the suspect-respondent. Hence, the Magistrate shall at this juncture entertain such

preliminary objections and inquire into the threshold criterion.

Upon a perusal of the facts and circumstances of the instant case, it is evident that the

virtual complainant refers to a commercial transaction between himself and the

incorporated entity named Horamulla Tea Plantation (Pvt) Ltd. The petitioner is one of

the Directors of the tea company. The complainant has not conducted any individual

transactions of a personal nature with the said director. (R1 the complaint to the Police

dated 17.03.2020 by the virtual complainant-respondent) The agreement of sale of

goods transpired between the Horamulla Tea Factory and the complainant, and, as such

the transactions therein transpired between the company and the complainant in the

11

CA-MCR-0001-22 Page 11 of 14 14/12/2022 IJ-56-22

ordinary course of business, which makes it irregular in law to hold an individual, of

the company liable, in his personal capacity, for the arrears of payment.

In the celebrated case of Saloman v A. Saloman & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22, HL, the

Saloman Principle was introduced which distinguished between the rights and duties of

the company from that of its stakeholders and directors. Therefore, the company attains

the status of a legal person while its directors or stakeholders gain the status of natural

persons, where the liability of one does not cross through to the other, which is also

termed as the corporate veil.

Thus, in this instant matter, as the course of this agreement of sale of tea leaves was

conducted by the company and not individually by the petitioner (as admitted by the

complainant himself in the complaint to the Police dated 17.03.2020- R1 -Document

marked as R1 by the complainant respondents with his objections), it is the company

that is liable for the breach (if any) of the business transaction. Therefore, corporate

liability of the Horamulla Tea Factory does not transfer to the petitioner, unless there is

evidence to prove the petitioners direct engagement in fraud, misappropriation or the

intention to engage in such fraudulent conduct. In which case the corporate veil will be

shifted to hold an individual liable for such offences. Therefore, unless the completed

investigation divulged a piercing in the veil of incorporation afforded to the Horamulla

Tea Plantation (Pvt) Ltd, by virtue of its incorporation, individual criminal liability cannot

be presumed to be attributed to the petitioner. It is pertinent to note that the caption of

the case application does not include Horamulla Tea Plantation (Pvt) Ltd, as a suspect.

At page 5 of the impugned order (page 117of the Appeal Brief), the Magistrate refers to

vicarious liability in the following manner:

.

.

261

.

12

CA-MCR-0001-22 Page 12 of 14 14/12/2022 IJ-56-22

This is erroneous for two reasons. Firstly, as explained above, the commercial

transaction that is central to the investigation was not of a personal character between

the virtual complainant and the petitioner. Therefore, the entire complaint is premised

upon a transaction between a person and a business entity. This nuance cannot be

brushed aside.

Secondly, the reference to Section 261 of the CPC is a pertinent consideration in this

regard, however the Magistrate cannot rely on it since the complainant has not named

the corporation as the suspect. The suspects in the instant case are the petitioner and

suspect respondent (his wife) in their personal capacity as individual persons as

opposed to their professional capacity as representatives of Horamulla Tea Plantation

(Pvt) Ltd. If the complainant purports that the petitioner is criminally liable for the

alleged default of payment, thus characterizing the transaction as a personal exchange,

it cannot be said in the same breath that the petitioners wife is also a suspect. It is

paradoxical to attach any individual liability to the wife because the husband has been

alleged to have committed a crime under the Penal Code. This absurd outcome is a

manifestation of the requirement to clearly delineate the separate legal personality of

the Horamulla Tea Plantation (Pvt) Ltd from its employers and the dismissal of the

Magistrate of any notion of vicarious liability is in complete disregard of this essential

element in the investigation.

None of these matters have been considered by the learned Magistrate in the impugned

order. The attribution of the purported criminality has a direct impact on the threshold

of sufficiency and reasonableness as contemplated by Section 120(3) read within its

context, and it is the considered view of this Court that in the absence such

consideration, the matter warrants this Court to invoke its revisionary jurisdiction in

setting aside the impugned order. This Court is of the observation that the learned

Magistrate has erred in distinguishing the liability of the company and that of the

natural persons involved in the course of business, thus misdirecting the proceedings

towards criminal liability of the petitioner whereas, it is a matter of corporate liability.

Thus, it is evident that there is no clear allegation against the petitioner in his individual

capacity. The Magistrate has erroneously held the petitioner criminally liable to the

extent of framing charges against him, even in the absence of any personal transactions

13

CA-MCR-0001-22 Page 13 of 14 14/12/2022 IJ-56-22

between the petitioner and the virtual complainant, thus failing to allude corporate

liability in its stead. While it may be argued that criminal liability may be attached to

the petitioners official capacity, it is clear that the completed investigation failed to

divulge any such link.

Conclusion

In line with the above observations, the Magistrate has a duty to ensure correct

application of the law set out in Section 120(3) of the CPC with an eye to the individuals

freedom and liberty. Magistrate must thoroughly peruse the reports of the investigation

to firmly ascertain the grounds for suspicion of the suspect, thereby properly

discharging and preventing the accumulation of cases which do not seemingly establish

suspicion. Although, it is recognized that, given the workload of a Magistrate Court, it

is impractical to expect to have all the cases thoroughly perused, however, when such

objections are brought to the attention of the Magistrate at the very outset of a

proceeding, as was seen in the present case, due regard must be had and inquired into

the matter with a precise application of the legal provisions. That way, the Courts

resources wont be wasted and they can be diverted to a more deserving case.

Section 120(3) of the CPC clearly enumerates the duty of the OIC in the police station

to submit a report to the Magistrate and in that report, if there is no allegation that:

1) The suspect has committed an offence OR

2) Been concerned in the committing of any offence,

the Magistrate shall discharge him.

Therefore, the learned Magistrate has a duty to examine the report forwarded by the

complainant before making a determination, without merely endorsing the contents of

the report of completed investigation. Section 120(3) of the CPC awards such judicial

discretion in order to cater towards the protection of an individuals rights to liberty and

freedom, thus such discretion must be exercised judiciously. In doing so, the Magistrate

must clearly record his reasoning, independent to the submissions by the parties. As

highlighted above, the role of the Magistrate in the event Section 120(3) CPC is invoked

is to exercise his discretion to assess whether the threshold requirement of sufficiency

14

CA-MCR-0001-22 Page 14 of 14 14/12/2022 IJ-56-22

and reasonableness has been met to satisfy the existence of a prima facie case to proceed

to the formal charging of the suspect.

Therefore, this Court holds that the impugned order has erred in several issues. Thus,

this Court affirms that there exists an irregularity and an illegality in the impugned

order. Hence, this Court sets aside the order of the learned Magistrate dated 22.12.2021

and discharge the petitioner and the suspect respondent.

The application is hereby allowed.
