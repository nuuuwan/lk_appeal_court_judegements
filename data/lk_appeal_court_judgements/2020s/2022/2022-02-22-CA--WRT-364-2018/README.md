Mayadunne Corea J

The facts of the case are briefly as follows, the Petitioner was awarded admission for a Ph.D.program at the Management and Science University Malaysia (MSU) by the National Institute ofEducation after having considered his performance and qualifications. The Petitioner wasgranted 2-years paid leave and a further period of one year no pay leave for this purpose. Thecourse was to be done part in Sri Lanka and the other part in Malaysia. The Petitioner proceededto Malaysia, having prepared himself to conduct a presentation under a topic for which he hadextensively gathered materials for over a year and a half. The Petitioner states that the supervisorappointed for the Petitioner made a sudden and drastic change to his research topic for which thePetitioner was left with only 3 months to prepare.

3

The Petitioner states that the drastic change to his research topic caused frustration and tensionwhich resulted the Petitioner being diagnosed with a depressive disorder and diabetes. ThePetitioner also states that eventually the Petitioner had to consult a mental health professionaland get treatment, which he follows to date. It is submitted that upon the advice of thepsychiatric physicians he was instructed to refrain from continuing his Ph.D. program as itdirectly affected and complicated the mental health of the Petitioner and this is alleged to havebeen informed to the 1st Respondent. The Petitioner informed MSU Malaysia of his situationafter which he was allowed to withdraw from the Ph.D. program owing to his medical condition.The university had issued a letter to the National Institute of Education to propose anotherstudent to follow the Ph.D. program. The Petitioner reported to work on 01.11.2016 on whichday the Petitioner was verbally informed not to resume work until further notice.

The Petitioner states that he was referred to a medical board by the National Institute ofEducation which duly recommended that the Petitioner was competent enough to resume serviceat the National Institute of Education. The Petitioner states that he was later informed by the 12th

Respondent that the Petitioner cannot be released from the Ph.D. program as per therecommendations of the medical board, which was contrary and misleading to the findings of themedical board. The Petitioner states that he requested in writing to the authority concerned forreinstatement of services with no favorable reply. The Petitioner further states that the NationalInstitute of Education Council informed the Petitioner two options available to him, that is toeither complete the Ph.D. course as per the agreement between the Petitioner and the NationalInstitute of Education or proceed to work and settle the full payments including the course feesborne by the National Institute of Education, salaries paid and any other expenses undertaken onbehalf of the Petitioner for the aforesaid Ph.D. program as per the agreement entered between theparties.

The Petitioner aggrieved by this decision filed this writ application and prays for the followingreliefs:

1. Grant and issue an order in the nature of writs of mandamus directing the 1st Respondent

to act under and in terms of the agreement and terminate the said agreement entered intowith the Petitioner on the medical condition of the Petitioner.

2. Grant and issue an order in the nature of writ of certiorari quashing the decisions taken by

the 1st- 11th Respondents (council members) to deduct the amount of money from thesalary of the Petitioner

3. Grant and issue an order in the nature of a writ of mandamus directing the 1st Respondent

to grant the salary increments entitled by the Petitioner

4

4. Grant and issue an order in the nature of writ of mandamus directing the 1st Respondent

to reinstate the Petitioner in service with effect from 01.11.2016 with back wages up to01.11.2017

Petitioners complaint

The Petitioner alleges that the Respondents should have acted under the agreement and asper the terms of the agreement and recall him and thereafter terminated the saidagreement due to the ill-health of the Petitioner but has failed to do so, thus, the saidfailure amounts to a breach of the statutory duties cast on the Respondents.

The Respondents have taken a decision to recover the money as per the contract and suchdecision is arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable and has been made with bad faith.

Hence this application for a Writ of mandamus and certiorari.

The Respondents in their objections have taken several preliminary objections and challengedthe jurisdiction of this Court to grant the reliefs sought by the Petitioner. This Court will considerthese Objections in a while.

The parties were not at variance on the following facts;

The Petitioner had been selected with several other candidates to follow the Ph.D.program at the Management and Science University Malaysia.

Pursuant to the said selection the Petitioner had entered into two agreements whereby thePetitioner was granted two years paid leave and one year no pay leave subject to theconditions of the agreement.

A surety bond executed in favor of the National Institute of Education with two sureties.

The government of Sri Lanka has born the expenditure for the time period the Petitionerwas engaged in his studies under the agreement.

The Petitioners grievance is that nearly two years into his first agreement P 2(a) the Petitionerhas fallen sick and has requested the Respondents to relieve him of the Ph.D. program. It iscontended that as per the agreement he entered into with the Director General of the NationalInstitute of Education, upon the Petitioner falling sick or due to deteriorating health the 1st

Respondent had a duty to terminate his agreement and recall the Petitioner. The Petitionerscontention is he fell sick due to a stressful condition caused in relation to the Ph.D. program. ThePetitioner argues that he has informed the 1st Respondent in this regard by the letter P6. This

5

Court observes that the document P6 does not demonstrate that the Petitioner had fallen sick dueto the educational program he has enrolled. However, the Petitioner has sent another letter dated02.08.2016 to the Director General of the National Institute of Education, stating that he wassuffering from depression due to various illnesses that has befallen him and also stated that hewas suffering from the continuous strain of heavy academic work and informed that he haddecided to discontinue the Ph.D. course and requested to return back to office work, and torelease him from the Ph.D. course (R2).

Thereafter the Petitioner has tendered a withdrawal application to the University dated19.08.2016 (P7). However, when the Petitioner submitted the withdrawal application whether itwas done with the concurrence of the Respondent is not clear and the Petitioner has failed toclarify this position to Court. We find that the Respondents in their objections have denied thePetitioners contention.

The Council of the National Institute of Education has decided to appoint a medical board inkeeping with the request and the agreement R4. The said letter address to the Director NationalHospital states as follows:

2014 30 03 . (depression) 2016.08.18 . .

05 . XXIII . .

The medical board had accordingly been constituted and the medical board has come to theconclusion that the Petitioner is fit to work (R5). The final determination as per the report says

Fit to carry out all his usual duties.

At this stage, this Court will consider the objections that had been raised by the Respondents.

6

Suppression of material facts.

In view of the Petitioners request to report back to work and in view of the findings of themedical board, the Respondents had sent R7 to the Petitioner. The said letter states as follow.

.

. 2016.10.20 407 2017.06.15 415 . 2017.11.01 2017.11.01 .

1. 2014 29

.

2.

The Petitioner in turn had informed the National Institute of Education that he does not wish tolet go of the opportunity that has been given to him and that he would wish to continue with thePh.D. program (R8). The said letter states

2014 29 Ph. D Research Methodology B . , Ph. D .

. . .

Ph. D .

Thus, by this letter the Petitioner has willingly agreed to continue with the Ph.D. course. Thisletter had been sent on 18.12.2017 which is after three years of obtaining leave. However, in thefollowing year on 07.02.2018 the Petitioner has once again changed his mind and sent another

7

letter informing, that he is not in a position to rejoin the Ph.D. program and has requested theNational Institute of Education to replace him with another candidate.

As per R1(b), by this time the Petitioner had been on paid and no-pay leave from 30.10.2014(R9). This letter had been sent in 2018 by which time four years had lapsed from the time thePetitioner had been given leave to pursue the course.

The Petitioner has failed to disclose the existence of R8 to this Court. As quite correctlysubmitted by the Respondents, this is a suppression of a material fact. This is a letter sent by thePetitioner and the existence of this document was never denied by the Petitioner. By this letterthe Petitioner has clearly indicated that he intends to go ahead with his Ph.D. program, thusdeclining to accept the option of reimbursing the Government of the expenses that had beenexpended on him up to date. The Petitioner had never requested the National Institute ofEducation to act under clause 8 or 11 of the agreement.

In the case of Alphonso Appuhamy v Hettiarachchi NLR 77 S. C. 779/72 it was held that theThe necessity of a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts to be placed before the Courtwhen an application for a writ or injunction is made and the process of the Court is invoked islaid down in the case of The King v. The General Commissioners -for the Purpose of theIncome Tax Acts for the District of Kensington-Exparte Princess Edmond de Poignac -(1917)1 Kings Bench Division 486. Although this case deals with a writ of prohibition theprinciples enunciated are applicable to all cases of writs or injunctions. In this case, aDivisional Court without dealing with the merits of the case discharged the rule on the groundthat the applicant had suppressed or misrepresented the facts material to her application. TheCourt of Appeal affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court that there had been a suppressionof material facts by the applicant in her affidavit and therefore it was justified in refusing a writof prohibition without going into the merits of the case. In other words, so rigorous is thenecessity for a full and truthful disclosure of all material facts that the Court would not go into

the merits of the application, but will dismiss it without further examination. Lord Cozens-HardyM. R., after stating that the authorities in the books are so strong and so numerous quoted thehigh authority of Lord Langdale and Rolfe B. in the case of Dalglish v. Jarvie-2 Mac. & G. 231,238, the head note of which states," It is the duty of a party asking for an injunction to bring under the notice of the Court all factsmaterial to the determination of his right to that injunction; and it is no excuse for him to saythat he was not aware of the importance of any facts which he has omitted to bring forward."

In R vs Kensington Income Tax Commissioners (1917) 1 KB 486, it was held that the partycannot plead that the misrepresentation was due to inadvertence or misinformation or that the

8

applicants was not aware of the importance of certain facts which he omitted to place before thecourt.

Accordingly, the objection on suppression or misrepresentation of facts succeeds.

The relationship between the parties is contractual.

The Respondents main objection was that the relationship between the parties is contractual, ifso, there cannot be a public law remedy when the dispute is contractual. The Petitioner obtainedleave and proceeded to the Ph.D. course after entering into an agreement. In fact, the maingrievance of the Petitioner is that the Respondents have failed to act as per the agreement enteredand has failed to comply with Clause 8 of the agreement P2a (R1a). We find that the main reliefsprayed in the prayer of the petition namely relief b), c) and d) are based on the agreement. Theyare as follows

(b) Grant and issue an order in the nature of writ of mandamus directing the 1st Respondent toact under and in terms of the agreement and terminate the said agreement entered into with thePetitioner on the medical condition of the Petitioner,

(c) Grant and issue an order in the nature of writ of certiorari quashing the decision taken by the1st 11th Respondents (council members) to deduct the amount of money from the salary of thePetitioner as per the document marked P25

(d) Grant and issue an order in the nature of writ of mandamus directing the 1st Respondent togrant the salary increments entitled by the Petitioner.

Now we will consider the relevant provisions of the agreement.

Thus, it is clear that the Petitioner is seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the Respondents tocomply with the provisions of the agreement prayer (b) and a writ of certiorari to quash thedecision that has flowed from the agreement prayer (c).

The learned Counsel for the Respondents argued that prayer (d) is pertaining to impugned acts orin actions by the 1st Respondent which is pursuant to clause 13 of the agreement.

It is clear to this Court that the Petitioner is seeking to obtain the reliefs prayed based on thecontractual relationship the parties have entered. This Courts considered view is that, theimpugned rights the Petitioner is attempting to enforce, is derived from his contractualrelationship with the Respondents. It is trite law that the parties cannot enforce their contractualobligations by public law remedies. The obligations and the rights of the parties are governed bythe clauses of the contract. In fact, it appears to this Court that the Petitioner is seeking specificperformance of the agreement. Thus, his remedy lies in the District Court.

10

In U.L. Karunawathie Vs. Peoples Bank & others CA Writ Application No. 863/2010(decided on 12.05.2015 it was held that, If no public duty exists at a given instance, then thecourts do not invoke and exercise its writ jurisdiction. As mentioned hereinbefore in thisjudgement, respondent bank had no public duty to perform towards the petitioner since thematter complained of comes within the contract of employment the petitioner had with thebank. Therefore, it is my opinion that the Petitioner in this case is not entitled to have the writof certiorari and mandamus issued, as sought in petition.

It was held in Jayaweera Vs. Wijeratne (1985) 2 SLR 413 Where the relationship betweenthe parties is purely contractual one of a commercial nature, neither certiorari nor mandamuswill lie to remedy grievances arising from an alleged breach of contract or failure to observethe principles of natural justice even if one of the parties is a public authority.

After hearing the submissions of both the learned Counsel, it is the view of this Court that thePetitioner by way of a mandamus is not attempting to compel the 1st Respondent to discharge apublic duty under a statute but is attempting to enforce an alleged obligation arising from acontract.

Therefore, the objection of the Respondent succeeds.

Even though the Respondents have succeeded in their first two objections we would consider theother objections raised for the purpose of record.

Is the action filed against the correct party?

The next objection the Respondents raised was that the Petitioner had failed to name the proper/ necessary parties.

This Court will now consider the agreement signed between the parties. The agreements markedas P2a, P2b, has the heading of National Institute of Education and is for officers of the Institutewho are on full pay and no pay basis engaged in studies. The agreements are signed between thePetitioner and Director General of the National Institute of Education on behalf of theGovernment of Sri Lanka. P2C is a surety bond in favour of the National Institute of Educationsigned between the sureties and the National Institute of Education. It is clear the study programis offered through the National Institute of Education for its employees. All the decisionspertaining to the study program and in this instance pertaining to the Petitioner had been taken bythe Council or the board of management of the National Institute of Education. As per P21 thePetitioner himself urges the NIE that a suitable lecturer to be nominated to the Ph.D. programthus conceding that the nomination authority is the National Institute of Education. The decisionmarked P25 clearly states that as per the surety bond entered with the National Institute ofEducation the expenses incurred by the National Institute of Education pertaining to the

11

Petitioners Ph.D. program will be deducted from his salary. The Respondents contended that thefollowing decisions arising out of the contract with the Petitioner were taken by the Council ofthe National Institute of Education namely:

(1) At its 406th meeting the National Institute of Education resolved that the Petitioner be

examined by a Medical Board approved by the 1st Respondent (marked as R3), inaccordance with the terms of the agreement.

(2) At its 419th meeting held on 19th October 2017, the National Institute of Education

resolved that the officer should either continue studied leading to the Ph.D. OR report forduty AND refund the money spent by the National Institute of Education.

(3) At its 424th meeting held on 22nd March 2018, the National Institute of Education resolved

that all expenses borne on behalf of the Petitioner must be recovered from him, andconveyed the said decision to the Petitioner by letter dated 12th March 2018 (theimpugned document marked as P25)

It is undisputed that the National Institute of Education is a legal entity established under theNational Institute of Education Act No. 28 of 1985. However, the National Institute of Educationhas not been made a party to this application. The Petitioners Counsel without conceding,strenuously argued that, in fact, if an order is to be made in favour of the Petitioner it has to beimplemented through the National Institute of Education. We observe that the Petitioner hasfailed to respond to this allegation.

The unexplained delay

The third objection of the Respondents was that, the Petitioner is seeking to quash the decision asper document P25 which is dated 12.05.2018. The said decision has been taken at the 424th

council meeting on 22.3.2018. The decision that if unable to proceed with the program, thePetitioner should pay the expenses incurred by the Institute, had been taken on 2017.11.01 andcommunicated to the Petitioner by letter dated 15.11.17 (R7). The Petitioner has filed this actionon 23.11.2018 nearly one year after R7 was sent. The Respondents heavily relied on the case ofBiso Menika Vs Cyril de Alwis (1982)1 SLR 368 in support of this contention.

In Issadeen Vs The Commissioner of National Housing & others(2003) 2 SLR10 it was held,Although there is no statutory provision in this country restricting the time limits in filingan application for judicial review and the case law of this country is indicative of theinclination of the Court to be generous in finding a good and valid reason for allowinglate applications, I am of the view that there should be proper justification given inexplaining the delay in filing such belated applications. In fact, regarding the writ of

12

certiorari, a basic characteristic of the writ is that there should not be an unjustifiabledelay in applying for the remedy.

Our Courts have continuously held that a party seeking public law remedies specially by way ofwrit applications should do so without delay as delay defeats the reliefs sought. If there is a delayit is incumbent on the party seeking the relief to explain the delay to the satisfaction of the Court.

For the reasons best known to the Petitioner, this Court finds that the Petitioner has failed to giveany reason to purge the delay or to answer the allegation of delay.

The Respondents have challenged the Petitioners plea that he is unfit to continue his studies.This is based on the premise that Petitioner on his request has been referred to a medical boardand the said board after examining him, has unanimously determined that he is fit to carry out hisusual duties (R5). The Respondents contention is that by R4 the Respondents have specificallystated the reason for submitting the Petitioner before the board and the boards unanimousdecision in this regard is contrary to what the Petitioner is stating.

While the Petitioners contended that what the medical board has stated is that the Petitioner issuitable to carry out his usual duties and it means his usual office work, the Respondents arguedthat in the light of R4 the usual duties should be understood in the context of R4. Leaving suchargument as it is, the Petitioners contention is that as per the documents P3, P4 and P5 thePetitioner is suffering from depression and is not in a fit condition to follow his Ph.D. course.However, the Respondents submitted that this finding is contrary to the medical reportssubmitted by the medical board who examined the Petitioner, thus making the medical fitness ofthe Petitioner, a disputed fact.

This Court is mindful that a writ Court is not in a position to come to a conclusion on disputedfacts as it has to be ascertained by evidence. For the Petitioners application on his mentalcondition to succeed, the Petitioners mental health condition has to be put in issue. It is trite lawthat when facts are in dispute, a writ will not lie. Thajudeen Vs Sri Lanka Tea Board (1981)2SLR 47.

For completeness, this Court will consider the Petitioners submission on the obligation owed tohim. The Petitioner contends that the Respondents should have acted under clause 8 of thecontract. Clause 8 (b) gives the discretion to the Director General to terminate and recall thescholarship recipient in the event of him falling sick or due to deteriorating health. It is adiscretion that is given to the Director General. However, the recipient has to inform the DirectorGeneral of his illness through an application. The said application has to be accompanied by amedical certificate from a doctor approved by the Director General. It is also pertinent to notethat as stated above in this Judgement and as reflected by P2 (a), (b), (c) and R1 (a), (b), (c) thePetitioner had exhausted the paid leave as well as the no pay leave. The money spent by the

13

National Institute of Education on the Petitioner is reflected in the statement of account R10.Thus, the said expenditure had been borne out by the National Institute of Education. TheInstitution has expanded this amount to educate and qualify its employees so that the ultimatebeneficiary would be the State at large.

When a recipient abruptly abandons the education program, to prevent the loss that it wouldcause, a clause is inserted in the agreement. Exceptions to this are the instances that arecontained in clause 8 (b) and 11 namely the recipient falling ill or the deterioration of therecipients health. Therefore, the party who is seeking the cover of the said clauses shouldstrictly comply with the provisions of the contract that enable the said clauses to be triggered.

At the argument stage this Court posed the question to the Counsel for the Petitioner and askedwhether an application has been made in compliance with these clauses and the learned Counselsanswer to this Court was in the negative.In the above circumstances this Court observes that for the Petitioner to succeed in hisapplication to obtain relief from the contract he must first comply himself with the provisions ofthe contract.

After considering all the facts and the legal submissions made before this Court, for the reasonsset out in this Judgment we are of the view that the Petitioner has failed to establish his right topursue and obtain a public law remedy.

Accordingly, we are not inclined to grant the reliefs prayed for in the petition. This application isdismissed without cost.
