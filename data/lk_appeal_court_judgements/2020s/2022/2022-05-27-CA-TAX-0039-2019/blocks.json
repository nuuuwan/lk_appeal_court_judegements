I am not sure that it is the most fortunate language that could have been adopted to express the idea that it is intended to convey; but still, that is the recognized language, and I propose to adhere to it. The real question in all these cases is this: A thing has been ordered by the legislature to be done. What is the consequence if it is not done? In the case of statutes that are said to be imperative, the Courts have decided that if it is not done the whole thing fails, and the proceedings that follow upon it are all voids. On the other hand, when the Courts hold a provision to be mandatory or directory, they say that, although such provision may not have been complied with, the subsequent proceedings do not fail. Still, whatever the language, the idea is a perfectly distinct one. There may be many provisions in Acts of Parliament which, although they are not strictly obeyed, yet do not appear to the Court to be of that material importance to the subject-matter to which they refer, as that the legislature could have intended that the non-observance of them should be followed by a total failure of the whole proceedings. On the other hand, there are some provisions in respect of which the Court would take an opposite view, and would feel that they are matters which must be strictly obeyed, otherwise the whole proceedings that subsequently follow must come to an end.",

I am inclined to agree with the learned Senior State Counsel that the obligation to prove application of the non-discrimination clause in the DTAA read with the exemption under Section 13 (b)(ii) of the IRA 2006 is undoubtedly on the Appellant. In fact, the Appellant being the assessee had two options.

It permits a permanent establishment of a non-resident company to claim equal treatment with a domestic enterprise of the country in which it is situated and receive a treatment no different from a resident company in that country. It means that the national treatment obligation applies if the nationals or residents of the two States are comparably placed or that two persons similarly situated must be treated similarly (Taxmanns Indian Double Taxation Agreements & Tax Laws, Vol. 1, 2004, para 30.3). The principal object is to forbid discrimination or unequal treatment in situations which are identical or comparable, and the principle requires that similar situations shall not be treated differently unless differentiation is objectively justified (supra).",

It was held that because the contracts for the sale of wine and champagne were concluded in France, the French firm was only trading with and not within the U.K. The mere production of some documents which indicate that purchases and sales take place outside Sri Lanka will not be conclusive evidence that the business is transacted out of Sri Lanka, unless the contracts or negotiations with the offshore suppliers, manufactures, producers or shippers take place outside Sri Lanka.

Lewellin [(1957) 1 All E.R. 561] where the US parent company (Akron) had a wholly-owned subsidiary company in the U.K. (Brentford) and Akron entered into agreements with its foreign distributors for the supply of Tires, which were manufactured and delivered direct from the U.K. by Brentford. It was held that although the main contract was located outside the U.K. Akron was trading in the U.K. through Brenford as its agent. The case highlights that the crucial factor was not the contract itself, but the dealings between Brentford and the foreign distributor and therefore, Akrons profits in the supply of Tyres by Brentford was subject to U.K. tax.",
