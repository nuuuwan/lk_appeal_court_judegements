After detaining the trucks, the police officers have chased behind the backhoe machine that was used to load sand into the trucks. The driver has fled leaving the backhoe in a shrub without leaving the key. When the police officers tried to start the machine with the aid of the mechanics, the 11th accused respondent has come with a gang and assaulted the police officers. Inspector Karunadheera (PW2) was assaulted heavily on his head with a shovel, and also the other officers. PW2 has lost the vision in one eye, his skull was fractured and the face was disfigured.

However, out of the factors mentioned from (a) to (k) in Section 303(1), only factors mentioned in (d) (for some of the accused respondents) and (k) can be considered in favour of the accused respondents.
