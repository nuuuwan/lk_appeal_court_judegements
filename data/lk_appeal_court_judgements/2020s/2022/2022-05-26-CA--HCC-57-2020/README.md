ARGUED ON : 22/03/2022

DECIDED ON : 26/05/2022

R. Gurusinghe, J.

The appellant was indicted in the High Court of Matara on a charge of rape

under section 364 of the Penal Code.

The appellant was convicted and sentenced to fifteen years of rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5,000/=, with a default term. In addition, the

appellant was ordered to pay a sum of Rs. 100,000/= as compensation and in

default of which, six months Simple Imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentences, the appellant appealed to

this court. The grounds of appeal set forth on behalf of the appellant are as

follows:

3

1. The learned High Court Judge completely misdirected himself of the

general principles of analyzing the evidence given in the trial. Therefore,

his conclusion is bad in law, and conviction is bad in law.

2. The learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by failure to judicially

evaluate the evidence and assist the evidence according to section 283 of

the Criminal Procedure Code, and thereby the conviction is bad in law

3. The learned High Court Judge completely misdirected the concept of

corroboration of evidence, when considering the prosecution case, and

thereby, his conclusion is bad in law.

4. The learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by failing to consider

the defence evidence in a proper context, according to established law.

Therefore, his conclusion is bad in law, causing a miscarriage of justice.

5. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by dis-regarding defence

evidence without substantial reasons given, and thereby, this judgment

is bad in law.

The prosecution called the prosecutrix (PW1), Judicial Medical Officer (PW4),

Ariyawathi (PW 2), police investigator (PW8) and the Court Registrar.

The appellant gave evidence under oath, and the appellants wife also gave

evidence on behalf of the defence. The appellant also called the doctor who

examined him. The appellant took up a plea of alibi.

PW1 testified that on the 22nd of October 2011, around 8.00 pm, while she was

watching TV, someone had suddenly covered her face with a cloth and carried

her and put her on a bed, and raped her. When the perpetrator tried to rape

her, she had twisted the rapists testicles. However, the perpetrator had gone

ahead and raped PW1 after tying her hands. After that, he untied her hands

and asked her for Rs. 5,000/=. She had said that she did not have money.

4

The perpetrator had then left through a window. PW1 also left through a

window and had come to the house of PW2. Then PW2, with the assistance of

her sons, took PW1 to the police station.

The police arrested the appellant on the same night at around 11.30 p.m. The

evidence of PW1 is that she identified the perpetrator by his voice. However,

when considering the evidence of PW1, the fact that she had the opportunity to

be familiar with the voice of the appellant is not consistent.

On Page 64 of the appeal brief, in evidence in chief, she has stated as follows:

: ?

Then the state the counsel repeated the question.

This is the first time in her evidence that PW1spoke about the identity of the

perpetrator. The evidence of PW1 was that she identified the appellant as the

perpetrator, but she did not say that she had identified him because of the

familiarity with his voice. Instead, she thought that the person who telephoned

her is the appellant, from his indecent words spoken via a telephone call in

May or June.

On page 67, evidence in chief, she stated as follows:

: l% ?

This answer shows that PW1 was not very firm about whether it was the

appellant.

On page 72, PW1 refers to what she had told to PW2.

: ?

If PW1 was so confident that it was the appellant who raped her, there was no

reason for her to refrain from telling it to PW2, as PW2 is also a woman, a very

close relative, and an associate of PW1. As per the evidence of PW2, she had

immediately taken PW1 to the police station by a three-wheeler. PW1 had not

told her who the perpetrator was.

On Page 75, she answered to court as follows:

: (this is regarding the rape)

: . .

Thus PW1 had thought that the person who made an indecent proposal to her

over the phone must be the man who raped her. Eventhough, she stated that

she was able to identify the perpetrator because of the telephone call, she had

not stated the same in her statement to the police. The attention of the Court

was drawn to that omission by the defence.

The evidence of PW1, as to whether she had the opportunity to be familiar with

the voice of the appellant is contradictory.

On page 81, PW1 answered to court as follows:

With the commencement of the cross-examination, PW1 had clearly admitted

that she was not there when the appellant fixed the grills to the windows of

her house. Her position was that on that particular day she went to sell

cinnamon and PW2 and her son was there to look after the work. All the grills

were fixed on the same day. As such, PW1 did not have the opportunity to

speak to the appellant on that day.

On the other hand, certain items including a part of the bedsheet which

contained certain patches suspected to be semen were produced to the court

by the police. However, the prosecution was not able to produce any scientific

evidence against the appellant as the report of the DNA test set out the results

that the DNA of the appellant was not found on the bedsheet.

E R S R Coomaraswamy, in his book The Law of Evidence volume 1, page

257, states as follows:

Identification of accused by voice

Some witnesses purport to identify a person by his voice. It is not safe to rely on

such identification and the liability to error is great.This is particularly for when

8

the identification was at night. But when the accused was intimately known to

the witnesses who identify him by his voice and gait, the Supreme Court of India

declined to hold that identification was unsafe. In South Africa, voice

identification parades have been held with dubious results.

The case law on voice identification emphasises that voice identification is more

difficult than visual identification. Therefore, identification by voice has to be

carefully considered and extremely cautious when basing a conviction on voice

identification evidence.

In the case of C. A. 18/2009,Marasinghe Arachilage Karunaratne and another

vs Attorney General decided on 4.10.2012. H M J Perera J. (as he was then)

stated as follows:

The counsel for the accused-appellants had brought to the notice of this court

several judgments relating to voice identification. Davies Vs The Crown [2004]

EWCA 2521, Rohan Taylor and Others Vs R SCCA No50- 53/1991, R Vs Hersey

[1998] Crim L.R.281, R Vs Gummerson and Steadman [1999] Crim L.R. 680, R Vs

Roberts [2000] Crim L.R.183. 1n all these cases it had been extensively

considered and clearly laid down as to how a court should consider evidence of

voice identification. The prosecution has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that it

was the voice of 1st accused and nobody else. There cannot be doubt, and the

evidence had to be very convincing and reliable. I am of the view that the

purported voice identification by the said witness is wholly unsafe, unreliable

and unsatisfactory. Having considered the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence

of these witnesses I am of the view that the evidence led at the trial, in this case,

is not sufficient to establish the identity of the accused to the required standard,

that is beyond reasonable doubt.

In the case Hattangalage Ariyadasa vs Attorney General CA 68/2011, decided

on 21.02.2013, voice identification evidence was accepted. In that case, the

witness was a sister-in-law of the accused. The witness, her sister and the

9

accused brother-in-law lived in the same land. Therefore, the witness was very

familiar with the voice of the accused. In that case, Sisira de Abrew J. quoted

the following from the Indian case of Kirpal Singh vs the State of Uthur Pradesh

1965 AIR, 712.

It is true that the evidence about identification of a person by the timbre of his

voice depending upon subtle variations in the overtones when the person

recognising is not familiar with the person recognised may be somewhat risky in

a criminal trial. But the appellant was intimately known to Rakkha Singh and for

more than a fortnight before the date of the offence he had met the appellant on

several occasions in connection with the dispute about the sugarcane crop.

Rakkha Singh bad heard the appellant and his brothers calling Karam Singh to

come out of the hut and had also heard the appellant, as a prelude to the

shooting referring to the dispute about sugarcane. In the examination, in-chief

Rakkha Singh has deposed as if he had seen the actual assault by the

appellant, but in cross-examination he stated that he had not seen the face of the

assailant of Karam Singh. He asserted however that he was able to recognize

the appellant and his two brothers from their 'gait and voice'. It cannot be said

that identification of the assailant by Rakkha Singh, from what he heard and

observed was so improbable that we would be justified in disagreeing with the

opinion of the Court which saw the witness and formed its opinion as to his

credibility and of the High Court which considered the evidence against the

appellant and accepted the testimony.

In this case, as per the evidence of PW1, the appellant was not a person

intimately known to PW1. PW1 did not have sufficient opportunity to be

familiar with the voice of the appellant. The purported identification of the

appellant by PW1 is therefore not safe and reliable. I am of the view that the

identity of the perpetrator is not established beyond reasonable doubt by

cogent and affirmative evidence.

10

The appellant was arrested within three to four hours of the alleged incident.

PW1 stated that she had twisted the testicles of the perpetrator. PW1 had

indicated to the police that the perpetrator was under the influence of liquor.

The police should have produced the appellant before a doctor and examined

his genitals to verify whether there was any evidence of twisting and whether

there was the smell of liquor. Instead, the police had assaulted him. The

medico-legal report (MLR) proved the evidence of the appellant that the police

assaulted him and produced VI. The evidence of the doctor who prepared the

(MLR) gave evidence and confirmed the fact that the appellant had injuries, as

stated in his report. The genitalia was normal. The medical report was taken

when the appellant was sent before the doctor by the prison authorities soon

after he was remanded. The appellant gave evidence from the witness box

under oath and was subjected to cross-examination. The appellant totally

denied the allegation. The appellants position was that he was arrested

around 11.30 p.m. by the police on that particular day. He came home after

work around 7.30 pm before 8.00 p.m. His wife and three children were there

at home at that time. He had taken dinner around 9.30 p.m.and went to sleep

around 10.30 p.m. The police called him out around 11.45 p.m.and arrested

him. In his police statement, the appellants position was that he had come

home around 7.30 pm and not left the house. His version in the High Court is

the same. The police recorded a statement from the appellants wife on the

29thof November 2011, when the appellant was in remand custody. The

appellants wife gave evidence in court and stated that her husband came

around 7.30 p.m.on the 22nd of October 2011 and had not left the house. The

evidence of the appellant and his wife are, therefore, substantially the same

and not materially contradicted.

The analysis of the prosecution evidence by the learned High Court Judge

contains only one sentence, whereas the analysis of the defence evidence

contains two sentences which shows that the learned High Court Judge had

failed to evaluate and analyse the evidence sufficiently. He has neither given

11

adequate reasons for the acceptance of the evidence of the prosecution nor the

rejection of the defence evidence.

For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that the prosecution has failed

to establish the case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

Therefore, the Judgment and the sentence of the learned High Court Judge

dated 20th October 2020 is set aside.

The appellant is acquitted. The appeal is allowed.
