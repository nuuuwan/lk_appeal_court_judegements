Defendant-Respondents

the 20th Defendant-Appellant (the Appellant) in the caption to the Petition of Appeal

was not a party to the partition action. The 1st and 2nd Plaintiff-Respondents instituted

the partition action for partitioning the land known as Davatagahahena which is

morefully described in the schedule to the plaint. After the statements of claim of the

Defendant-Respondents were tendered to the Court, the case had been fixed for trial

and upon conclusion of the trial on 10.10.1994, a date has given to tender the documents

marked at the trial and the list of shares which the parties were entitled. When the case

was called before the open court on 23.11.1994 for that purpose, the Appellant made

an application to add him as a party to the action. The Court allowed that application,

subject to a pre-payment of costs to the parties to the action and given a date to pay the

pre-paid costs. On the date which the pre-paid costs had to be paid, the Appellant did

not pay it and the Court, therefore, did not add him as a party to the action. Thereafter,

the learned District Judge delivered the judgment allotting shares to the parties to the

action and the Appellant did not get any share/right in the land sought to be partitioned.

Then he preferred this Appeal against the judgment seeking reliefs, inter alia, to set

aside the judgment of the District Court and an order for a re-trial.

After hearing the Appeal, this Court concluded that the Attorney-at-Law who filed the

proxy for the 1st and 2nd Plaintiff-Respondents in the District Court had failed to file the

Declaration under section 12 of the Partition Act, No. 21 of 1977 (the Partition Act).

On that basis the judgment of the District Court was set aside ordering a trial de novo.

The 1st and 2nd Plaintiff-Respondents sought special leave to appeal from the Supreme

Court against that judgment of this Court dated 07.01.2019. Before the Supreme Court,

the learned Counsel appeared for the parties submitted to Court that even though, the

learned Counsel had inadvertently made submissions at the hearing of the Appeal

before this Court on the basis that the section 12 Declaration had not been filed, in fact

it had been filed. Accordingly, the Supreme Court set aside the judgment dated

07.01.2019 of this Court and the case record had been sent back to this Court to consider

the matters set out in the Petition of Appeal dated 27.10.1995 on the merits.

When the Appeal was taken up for hearing, the learned Presidents Counsel appearing

for the Appellant, admitting that the Appellant who was not a party to the partition

action is not entitle to invoke appellate jurisdiction of this Court and that the appeal is

misconceived in law, invited the Court to consider the Appeal as a Revision Application

and grant reliefs prayed for in the Petition of Appeal.

The matters which a court should consider when exercising its revisionary jurisdiction

were discussed in series of judgments both by the Court of Appeal as well as by the

Supreme Court. In the case of Maiam Beebee vs. Seyed Mohamed1, Sansoni C. J.

observed that;

The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite independent of and

distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of this (Supreme) (emphasis added) court.

Object of the revisionary power is the due administration of justice and the correction

of errors, sometimes committed by the court itself, in order to avoid miscarriages of

justice. It is exercised in some cases by a judge of his own motion, when an aggrieved

person who may not be a party to the action is brought to his notice the fact that, unless

the power is exercised, injustice will result. The partition act has not, I conceive, made

any changes in this respect, and the power can still be exercised in respect of any order

or decree of a lower court.

In the instant case, the learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the Appellant argued

that when a person who is not a party to a partition action makes a claim before the

Surveyor, he is deemed to be a party to the action and he should add to the case as a

party by the court itself. According to the learned Presidents Counsel, non-addition of

the Appellant as a party to the action, though, he had preferred a claim to the land sought

to be partitioned before the Surveyor, is a miscarriage of justice and this Court,

therefore, should exercise its revisionary jurisdiction and set aside the judgment of the

1 (1965) 68 NLR 36.

6

District Court, allow the Appellant to tender his statement of claim and order for a re-

trial.

It is borne out from the case record in the District Court that the Appellant whose name

is mentioned in the Surveyors report as a claimant has been served with a notice in

terms of section 16 (4) and thereafter, on the direction of the Court by the Fiscal in term

of section 20 (1) (a) of the Partition Act (as amended).

Sub-section (1) of section 20 states thus;

The court shall order notice of a partition action to be sent by registered post-

(a) to every claimant (not being a party to the action) who is mentioned in the report of

the surveyor under subsection (1) of section 18, and

(b) to every person disclosed under paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 19 by a

defendant in the action.

Section 20 (3) provides that;

Any person receiving notice under subsection (1) of this section shall not be added as

a party to the action unless he applies by motion in writing to be added on or before

the date specified in the notice.

Therefore, it is clear that the Partition Act provides that a claimant before the Surveyor

or a person to whom a notice was issued in terms of section 20, could be added only if

such party applies by way of a motion in writing to add him as a party to the action.

Hence, the Court cannot accept the argument of the learned Presidents Counsel that

when a person (who is not a party to a partition action) makes a claim before the

Surveyor, he is deemed to be a party to the action and he should be added to the case.

Even though, the notices have been served on the Appellant by the Surveyor and

through the Court he has not honoured the notices. Furthermore, the learned District

Court Judge has allowed the Appellants belated application to add him as a party to

7

the action subject to a prepayment of costs. But he has failed to act according to that

order of the Court either. Under the said circumstances, this Court can be satisfied that

the District Court has followed the procedure laid down in the Partition Act correctly.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the Appellant has failed to satisfy the Court that a

positive miscarriage of justice had been caused to him.

It was decided in the case of Vanik Incorporation Ltd vs. Jayasekare2 that revisionary

powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has occurred due to the

fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but only when a strong case is made out

amounting to a positive miscarriage of justice.

Even though, the learned District Judge has made the order on 30.01.1995 refusing to

add the Appellant as a party to the action due to non-payment of pre-paid costs, the

Appellant has not taken any step against that order for more than 7 months until he

preferred this appeal on 14.09.1995 against the judgment of the District Court.

Therefore, it is evident that the Appellant had slept over his rights. In the case of Don

Lewis vs Dissanayake3 the Supreme Court held that; it was not the function of the

Supreme Court, in the exercise of the jurisdiction now invoked, to relieve parties of the

consequences of their own folly, negligence and laches. The maxim vigilantibus, non

dormientibus, jura subveniunt provided a sufficient answer to the petitioner's

application.

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the application

discloses exceptional circumstances which shocks the conscience of the court. In the

case of Cadermenpulle vs. Ceylon Pazer Sacks Ltd4 it was held that: The existence of

exceptional circumstances is a pre-condition for the exercise of the powers of revision;

2 (1997) 2 Sri.L.R.365.

3 70 NLR 8.

4 (2001) 3 SRI. L.R. 112.

and absence of exceptional circumstances in any given situation results in refusal of

remedies.

In Dharmarathne & Another vs. Palm Paradis Cahanas Ltd. & Others5, Gamini

Amaratunga J. emphasised the importance of establishing the existence of exceptional

circumstances as follows:

Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the court selects the

cases in respect of which the extraordinary method of rectification should be adopted.

If such a selection process is not there, the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court will

become a gateway of every litigant to make a second appeal in the garb of revision

application or to make an appeal in situations where the legislature has not given a right

of appeal. The practice of the court is to insist on the existence of exceptional

circumstances for the exercise of revisionary powers has taken deep root in our law and

has got hardened into a rule which should not be lightly disturbed

The decision of Bank of Ceylon vs. Kaleel and Others6 enunciates the grounds upon

which courts usually exercise its discretion in revision applications as follows:

The court to exercise revisionary jurisdiction, the order challenged must have

occasioned a failure of justice and manifestly erroneous which go beyond an error,

defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would instantly react to it. In other words,

the order complained of is of such a nature which would have shocked the conscience

of the court.

In the case in hand, neither stated in the Petition of Appeal nor in the submissions of

the learned Presidents Counsel the manner in which the impugned judgment of the

District Court shocks the conscience of the Court and the exceptional circumstances for

this Court to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction.

5 (2003) 3 Sri.L.R. 34.

6 (2004) 1 Sri.L.R 284.

The position of the learned Presidents Counsel appeared for the Appellant is that the

Appellant is a co-owner of the land sought be partitioned and his title deed to the land

should have been considered by the learned District Judge. Nevertheless, that deed has

not been tendered to the Court at the trial. Therefore, the learned District Judge had no

opportunity to consider that deed. Considering the documentary and oral evidence of

the case placed before the Court at the trail, the learned District Judge has decided the

rights of the parties.

When considering all the above stated facts and circumstances, this Court cannot be

satisfied that a miscarriage of justice has been caused to the Appellant and a situation

which shocks the conscience of the Court has been arisen to interfere with the

proceedings and/or the judgment of the District Court for the due administration of

justice. Therefore, I hold that the Appellant has failed to satisfy Court that it should

exercise the revisionary jurisdiction. Therefore, I dismiss the appeal and affirm the

judgment dated 30.08.1995 of the District Court. I direct the learned District Judge to

enter the interlocutory decree according to that judgment.
