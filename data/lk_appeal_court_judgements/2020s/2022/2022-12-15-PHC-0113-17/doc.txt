Judgment

This appeal emanates from the Order of the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa

holden at Rathnapura dated 16.03.2017 which refused to set aside the Order of the

Page 3 of 8

learned Magistrate of Balangoda dated 27.07.2007 and allowed the application of the

Applicant-Respondent-Respondent [hereinafter referred to as the Respondent] in terms

of Section 10(1) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.07 of 1979 to evict

the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant [hereinafter referred to as the Appellant] from

the land in question.

It appears that the Respondent had made an application to the Magistrate Court of

Balangoda in terms of Section 05 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.07

of 1979 [hereinafter referred to as the Act] against the Appellant, supported by an

affidavit with notice of quit, seeking an Order of ejectment of the Appellant from the

land in suit. The learned Magistrate having inquired into the matter and after the

conclusion of the inquiry had delivered the Order on 27.07.2007 allowing the

application to evict the Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondent-Petitioner has invoked the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa holden at

Rathnapura seeking to revise the said Order of the learned Magistrate dated 27.07.2007.

However, the learned High Court Judge had refused the application of the Respondent-

Petitioner by his Order dated 16.03.2017. Subsequently, the Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant] had preferred an appeal

to this Court.

It appears the Appellant has taken up the objection that the Applicant-Respondent-

Respondent [hereinafter referred to as the Respondent] had not complied with Rule

3(7) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990, thus filed a statement of

objections without an affidavit to the revision application filed in the Provincial High

Court, which is not valid in law.

It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that the said preliminary objection had

been taken up by the Appellant in paragraph 3 of the counter affidavit filed in the

Provincial High Court. However, the learned High Court Judge had not mentioned a

single word regarding the said preliminary objection of the Appellant.

Page 4 of 8

The position taken by the Respondent was that the learned High Court Judge has

correctly evaluated the Order of the learned Magistrate and the Appellant had not

shown any exceptional circumstances exist to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court of Ratnapura.

It is seen that the Appellant had not challenged the Order of the learned Magistrate

dated 27.07.2007 instead had taken the objection that statement of objections should

be rejected since the Respondent had not filed an affidavit with the statement of

objections and that accordingly, relief prayed in the prayer to the petition filed in the

Provincial High Court should have been granted.

In this respect, it was submitted by the Respondent that since the application to the

High Court by the Appellant is an application for revision, even if no objection had been

filed and there had been no appearance, the Appellant was not entitled to relief unless

the Court granted relief in extraordinary circumstances.

The case Gita Fonseka vs. Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka [2004]

(1) SLR 149 was cited on behalf of the Appellant. In this case, affidavit was filed

without a statement of objection and the Court held that Rule 3(7) had not been

complied with.

However, in the case at hand, statement of objections had been filed without an

affidavit. In this instance, it is worthy to note Rule 3(7) of the Court of Appeal

(Appellate Procedure) Rules.

Upon an application being registered, the Respondent shall be entitled to take

notice of it, and file a statement of objections at any time before the date fixed

by Court for filing objections. A statement of objections containing any

averments of facts shall be supported by an affidavit in support of such

averments.

It appears that Rule 3(7) requires a statement of objections to be filed. In the event it

contains an averment of facts, it must be supported by an affidavit.

Page 5 of 8

It was the contention of the Respondent that a fortiori, these averments in the

statement of objections that are legal and not factual do not require an affidavit and

if there are no factual averments, no affidavit is necessary. Since the statement of

objections of the Respondent was based entirely on law and there were no factual

averments, the Respondent is of the view that there was no requirement for an affidavit

and that Rule 3(7) has been complied with. I hold that the Respondents said contention

is plausible thus, no affidavit is required to file with the objection, if such objections

are entirely based on questions of Law.

In the case of Attorney General Vs. Chandrasena [1991] 1 S.L.R 85 (CA) Court

considered the question that whether an affidavit should be filed in a revision

application. The Court observed that it would depend on the question and manner in

which the jurisdiction of Court is invoked. Gunawardana, J. held that;

The absence of an affidavit by Attorney General did not violate the provisions

of Rule 46 of the Supreme Court Rules, as the Court was invited to decide only a

question of Law, and the relevant matters for that decision, have been admitted

by the Accused-Respondent. However, in a case where Attorney General is

inviting the Court to decide on question of fact, he will be required to file

affidavits through persons who have personal knowledge of the relevant facts.

Since the Respondent has taken up the position that the statement of objections is

entirely based on questions of Law, requirement of an affidavit in terms of Rule 3 (7)

is not necessary.

Furthermore, Court draws the attention to the statement by Abrahams, CJ. In the case

of Dulfa Umma Vs. Urban District Council, Matale [1939] 40 NLR at p. 478;

Civil Procedure should be a vehicle which conveys a litigant safely,

expeditiously and cheaply along the road which leads to justice and not a

juggernaut car which throws him out and then runs over him leaving him maimed

and broken on the road.

Page 6 of 8

Be that as it may, it is settled law that a party can invoke the revisionary jurisdiction

only on exceptional circumstances that shock the conscience of court.

It is to be observed that the Appellant has prayed to set aside the Order of the learned

High Court Judge dated 16.03.2017 and also to revise the Order of the learned

Magistrate dated 27.07.2007.

The Appellant had not shown in the instant revision application filed in the High Court

that there is a miscarriage of justice or any injustice caused to the Appellant by the

Order of the learned Magistrate. Thus, it is apparent that no exceptional circumstances

exist for the Appellant to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court.

In this instance, Court draws the attention to the case of Muhandiram Vs. Chairman JEDB

reported in [1992] 1 S.L.R 110 where Grero, J. held that;

In an inquiry under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, the onus is on the

person summoned to establish his possession or occupation that it is possessed or

occupied upon a valid permit or other written authority of the state grant according to

any written Law-if this burden is not discharged, the only option open to the Magistrate

is to order ejectment.

In the case of M.C Margrate Perera Vs. Divisional Secretary Naula [CA/PHC/41/2010] C.A

Minutes 31.01.2017 Dehideniya, J. emphasized the scope of an inquiry under Section 9 of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act is limited to;

1. Occupying the land on a permit or a written authority.

2. It must be a valid permit or a written Authority.

3. It must be in force at the time of presenting it to Court.

4. It must have been issued in accordance with any Written Law.

Further it was held that the party noticed is not entitled to challenge the opinion of

the competent authority on any matter stated in the application.

As such, it clearly manifests that in an action to recover possession of a State Land, the

only available defence for the occupier sought to be evicted from the subject land, is

to establish that he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or

other written authority of the State granted according to any written law.

Page 7 of 8

It is worthy to note that the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant has not relied upon any

document, valid permit or grant to substantiate the fact that he had written permission

or authority to occupy the state land in question.

Thus, in the absence of written authority or a valid permit to occupy the State land at

the time of serving the notice of quit, the learned Magistrate had correctly issued the

order of eviction against the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant.

It is seen that in Section 9 (1) another restriction on the Respondent which was dealt

by Wengappuli, J. in the Case of J.M Chandrika Priyadharshani [The competent

authority] Vs. Loku Hettiarachchige Seneviratne [CA (PHC) 52/2012] C.A Minutes

13.07.2018 where is was held that;

At such inquiry, the person on whom summons under Section 6 has been served

shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in the application under

Section 5 except that he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid

permit or other written authority of the state granted in accordance with any

written Law and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or

otherwise rendered invalid.

Furthermore, Section 5(1) imposes a duty on the competent authority to set out certain

facts in his application for ejectment and has included these factors in Section 5 (1) (a)

and (b).

Section 5 (1) (a) (i) of the Act reads that he is a competent authority for the purpose

of this Act.

In respect of Sections 5 (1) (a) (i) and Section 9 (1), it is observable that the intention

of the Legislature is to impose a restriction on the Respondent in an application for

ejectment, thus, the Respondent is precluded by contesting before the Magistrates

Court against the claim by the competent authority, in terms of the Application made

under Section 5 of the Act.

Page 8 of 8

In view of the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that the grounds of appeal raised

on behalf of the Appellant are without merit, thus, the appeal has to be dismissed.

As such, we are not inclined to interfere with the Order dated 27.07.2007 of the learned

Magistrate and the Order dated 16.03.2017 by the learned High Court Judge.

Hence, the impugned Orders are affirmed and the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed

at Rs.25,000/-.
