MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to set aside the order of the

learned High Court Judgeof Anuradhapura dated 19.9.2019.

In the said order the accused petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

accused) had been convicted and sentenced for offences under section 367 of

the Penal Code to be read with section 5(1) of the Public Property Act.

The indictment has been received by the High Court of Anuradhapura in 2002,

but Court had not been able to summon the accused for some time due to the

non-availability of the address of the accused, but in 2002 .7.17 summons have

been issued but accused had never appeared in Court, from 2002.7.17 to

2003.4.30 he had not responded to the summons and as such on that day he

had been warranted.

But on 2003.2.3an attorney at law had appeared and had asked for certified

copies of the proceedings in Court.

As the accused had not responded to warrant as well proceedings under section

241 of the Criminal Procedure Code had been fixed and on 28th of June 2005

trial in absentia has been fixed and trial had concluded and it had been fixed for

judgment on 2019.2.22.

But thereafter an attorney at law had appeared and had wanted Court to

consider a short cut without judgment in the absence of the accused but it

had not worked out and finally judgment had been pronounced and the

accused had been convicted on the 19.9.2019.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment the accused had filed the instant

application for revision in 2021 July 21st.

The accused has filed the instant application for revision after a lapse of 2 years

and furthermore he has failed to exercise his right of appeal.

The reasons given by the Counsel for the accused is that he had been unaware

of the proceedings in Court against him.

But as stated above as soon as the trial had concluded and it had been fixed

for judgment a lawyer had appeared and had requested Court to consider a

short cut in 2019, therefore although the accused had not been physically

present, the lawyer could not have acted on his own, hence it is very clear

that the accused had been aware of the pending judgment which was to be

pronounced. Therefore his plea of ignorance at this stage is cloaked with

falsity.

Furthermore it is a well-founded principle of law that if a party files a revision

application the party filling the same has to satisfy Court that there is a very

obvious miscarriage of justice which shocks the conscious of Court.

Hence especially if there is delay it is considered to be a fatal error unless the

petitioner offers an explanation acceptable to Court. This has been held by this

bench in the case of CA/PHC/APN78/2021.

Hence this Court is unable to agree with the explanation offered by the Counsel

for the accused therefore the instant application for revision is dismissed

without issuing notice to the respondents.
