The Privy Council decided, in, N W. DE COSTA, Appellant, and THE TIMES

OF CEYLON LTD. and another, Respondents, (1963) that,

A large number of issues were framed at the trial. The learned District Judge

found numerous issues of fact in favour of the respondents and dismissed the

action. The appeal in the Supreme Court was heard by Basnayake C.J., Pulle J.

and Sinnetamby J. By a majority judgment (Basnayake C.J. dissenting) the

appeal was dismissed and the judgment of the learned District Judge was

affirmed. The learned Chief Justice considered that the appellant was entitled to

succeed in his claim and would have awarded him Rs. 5,000 damages.

The law which must be applied in approaching the issues which arise in

this appeal is the law of defamation in Roman-Dutch law as applied in

Ceylon. The existence of animus injuriandi is therefore an essential basis

of the cause of action. As Basnayake C.J. pointed out in his judgment

defamation is a species of injuria and injuria litteris is committed when a

person has assailed the reputation of another by publishing to a third person

matter intended to bring him into contempt ridicule or hatred animo injuriandi:

and animus injuriandi being a state of mind has in the generality of cases to be

inferred from the words and the occasion on which and the context and the

circumstances in which they are used. If the existence of animus injuriandi is

shown or can be presumed to exist the defence may seek to negative it by

raising a plea of justification. In order to establish that plea it is not enough to

show that the words complained of are true: it must be shown that their

3 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

publication was in the public interest or for the public benefit. A further defence

that may be raised is that of fair comment. This necessitates establishing that

the facts upon which the comment is based are true, that the comment is in

reality comment and is fair and bona fide, and that the comment is made on a

matter of public interest.

The aforesaid case, came up, as an appeal of a case decided in the Supreme

Court of Ceylon (as the aforesaid quoted paragraph also refer). Three Judges

were appointed to hear the plaintiffs (Mr. N.W. de Costas) appeal from the

dismissal of his action by the learned District Judge, since two Judges heard

the appeal at first could not agree. The learned Chief Justice, Hema Henry

Basnayake, who (in his lordships dissenting judgment) allowed the appeal and

proposed to award Rs. 5000/- damages, said as produced below, of the

applicable law,

It is well settled that questions relating to defamation fall to be determined in

this country according to the principles of Roman-Dutch law. When

approaching questions of Roman-Dutch law, especially in a branch of law like

defamation it is well to bear in mind the words of Lord Tomlin in the case of

Pearl Assurance Company Ltd. v. Government of the Union of South Africa 1

In the first place, the questions to be resolved are questions of Roman

Dutch law. That law is a virile living system of law, ever seeking, as every

such system must, to adapt itself consistently with its inherent basic

principles to deal effectively with the increasing complexities of modem

organized society. That those principles are capable of such adaptation

cannot be doubted, and, while it would be idle to assert that the

development of the Roman Dutch law in the territories now constituting

the Union has not been affected appreciably by the English law, yet in

their Lordships judgment, approach should be made to any question

governed by Roman Dutch law without any fetter imposed by

recollections of other systems, and through the principles of Roman

Dutch law alone.

4 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

The fact that the solution of a particular problem reached by the Roman

Dutch law bears a similarity to the solution provided by another system

does not necessarily indicate any imposition of the rules of one system

upon the other, but. May be cogent evidence of a resemblance between

the relevant basic principles of the two systems.

The existence of well-annotated standard treatises on the law of defamation in

England and America is a great inducement for lawyers and judges almost

instinctively to resort to them for the solution of problems which should be

solved according to the principles of Roman-Dutch law. At the same time, I do

not wish to be understood as saying that under no circumstances should

we examine the decisions of courts of other jurisdictions when called upon

to solve an intricate question of law in our system. But the tendency to

resort to English and American treatises and decisions without first

endeavouring to solve the problems that arise according to Roman-Dutch,

law should be resisted. Melius De Villierss Treatise on the Law of Injuries and

Manfred Nathans Treatise on the Law of Defamation in South Africa afford

considerable assistance in ascertaining the Roman-Dutch law as developed in

South Africa. [Emphasis added in this judgment]

Mr. N. W. de Costa was a student, later a teacher and even later the Acting

Principal of the school called Ananda Shasthralaya, of Kotte. It is referred to

in Chief Justice Basnayakes judgment, that, Mr. Costa said he has exhausted

all his means at the litigation before the District Court and hence he appears in

person. Basnayake C.J., also says that Mr. Costa when presenting his case

(against a battery of lawyers consisted of H. W. Jayewardene Q. C. and N. D. M.

Samarakoon, etc.) did justice to his case. No wonder, for although he lost

before the Supreme Court of Ceylon (Judgment of Pulle J. and Sinnethamby J.)

he won before the Privy Council, which allowed his appeal and granted him the

same amount of damages as allowed by Basnayake C.J., where he appeared in

person. Thus, in a way, the Privy Council has approved the judgment of

Basnayake C. J.

5 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

Chief Justice Basnayake, further said in his lordships judgment,

The kind of defamation that arises for consideration in the instant case, viz.,

publication by a newspaper to all and sundry, is the type of defamation known

to Roman-Dutch law as Famosis libellis and falls into the classification of

Injuria litteris. (Voet 47. 10.107 Gane 226)

A wrong is done by writing when a person has assailed the reputation of

someone by handing a screed to the Emperor or to another; or with a

view to the contemning and mockery and loss of reputation of someone

has made up, published, noised abroad, made known to others or

printed an information, narrative, comedy, screed or jingle; or has with

evil intent brought about the happening of any of those things.

Now when dealing with this type of defamation it is well to bear in mind that in

this country a newspaper enjoys no greater right than the individual citizen.

The following words of Lord Shaw in the case of Arnold The King Emperor of

India 1, though expressed in a criminal case in relation to Burma, can with

equal force be used in relation to Ceylon

The freedom of the journalist is an ordinary part of the freedom, of the

subject, and to whatever lengths the subject in general may go, so also

may the journalist, but apart from statute-law, his privilege is no other

and no higher. The responsibilities which attach to his power in the

dissemination of printed matter may, and in the case of a conscientious

journalist do, make him more careful; but the range of his assertions, his

criticisms, or his comments, is as wide as, and no wider than, that of any

other subject. No privilege attaches to his position.

As stated by the learned Chief Justice, while the tendency to refer to

overlapping areas in other countries, such as England and United States,

because of the availability of well annonated works on those legal systems on

defamation, is to be resisted, the usage of the similar concepts (especially, as to

defences) in those other systems, despite having different terms to identify

those concepts, could be seen.

6 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

It is pertinent to note that his lordship the Chief Justice also said,

In dealing with the Roman-Dutch law of defamation it is advisable as suggested by

De Villiers (48 S. A. L. J. 467) to avoid such expressions as malice, express malice,

legal malice implied malice, and actual malice. The expression malice in English

law has given rise to a great deal of misunderstanding and some of the English jurists,

notably Pollock, have adopted the formula of absence of good faith, which is the

expression used in section 479 of our Penal Code. In Roman-Dutch law for defamation

to be actionable it is not necessary that it should have entailed special damage or

actual pecuniary loss to the person defamed {Fradd v. Jacquelin),5. It is sufficient that

his feelings have been injured and that the writer intends to do so. (Boyd Moss v.

Ferguson) 6.

Having said so, if animus injuriandi must be present in Roman Dutch Law to

constitute defamation, cannot it be said, that, the absence of animus

injuriandi, simplicitur a valid defence, without seeking refuge in the accepted

defences in English Law?

M. G. Perera vs. A. V. Peiris, 1948, was a decision of the Privy Council. Dr.

Pereras action on defamation in respect of a news item published in the

newspaper called, The Ceylon Daily News, was dismissed in the District Court.

The Supreme Court of Ceylon affirmed that dismissal.

D. N. Pritt, K.C., for the respondent (The Ceylon Daily News) in his

submissions, raised the question with regard to absence of animus injuria. He

said,

In the Roman Dutch Law of defamation the existence of the animus injuriandi is an

essential pre-requisite of liabilityIt was therefore open in the Roman Dutch Law to a

defendant to negative liability by proving the absence of animus injuriandi on his part.

Voet in De Injuriis (47.10.20) states Next with regard to the person who is alleged to

have occasioned an injury the fact that he had entertained no intention to injure

(animus injuriandi) is a good ground for his not being held liable in an action for

injury. The fact that such intention was absent is to be gathered from the

7 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

circumstances of each particular case; for an intention of this kind has its seat in the

mind, and in a case of doubt its existence should not be presumed, (de Villiers

Translation, p. 189.) In fact what are today regarded as the established defences in

defamation are, in their origin, various different ways of negativing animus injuriandi.

With time, however, they developed into stereotyped defences whereby a presumption

of animus injuriandi could be rebutted. The scope of some of them like privilege and

fair comment are fairly clearly defined, but that of the others, like rixa, compensatio,

jest and mistake, is less clear. This development has been taking place over the last

fifty years or more and is still taking place. The absence of animus injuriandi still

exists as general category providing a substantive defence in itself. The Roman Dutch

Law, under the rule of absence of animus injuriandi, still retains the capacity to

extend a defence into a sphere not covered by any of the established defences.

Mr. Pritt continued,

In Ceylon and this is a case governed by the Roman Dutch Law as developed in

Ceylon the defence of the absence of animus injuriandi exists as a vital, living force.

This defence has been uniformly and consistently adopted by the Supreme Court of

Ceylon in Silva v. Raman Chetty 1 (1895) 1 NLR 225; David v. Bell2 (1913) 16 NLR

318; Cantlay v. Vanderspar 3 (1914) 17 NLR 353; Gulich v. Green i.(1918) 20 NLR

180.

In SILVA v. RAMEN CHETTY., (1895) it was said, the above words were per se

contumelious, and their publication should be presumed to have been made with a

contumacious intent, in the absence of proof that the defendant wrote the words

complained of sine injuriandi animo et affect.

Withers J., said, And even had this fact not been true, he might possibly have

repelled the presumption of animus injuriandi by disclosing a state of circumstances,

including his own prudence of conduct and honesty of purpose, from which the Court

might have properly inferred that, though the language was contumelious, it was not

written with injuriandi animo et affect.

In DAVID v. BELL et al, (1913) it was said, In a case of defamation, malice, in

mode m English law, is no more than the absence of just cause or excuse ; and,

8 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

similarly, an actual intention or desire to injure is not, under the Roman-Dutch law,

necessary to constitute animus injuriandi. Reckless or careless statements may be

taken as proof of animus injuriandi; and while, in English law, malice can only be

refuted by showing that the occasion was privileged, or that the words were no more

than honest and fair expressions of opinion on matters of public interest and general

concern, the Roman-Dutch law allows proof, not only of such a circumstance as that

the occasion was privileged, but of any other circumstance that furnished a

reasonable excuse for the use of the words complained of.

Pereira J., said, the Roman-Dutch law allows proof, not only of such a

circumstance as that the occasion was privileged, but of any other circumstances that

furnish a reasonable excuse for the use of the words complained of.

In CANTLAY v. VANDEESPAAB, (1914) it was said, Under the Roman-Dutch law,

injury to one's feelings, honour, dignity, or reputation is not actionable, unless the

offender acted animo injuriandi. Joke or jest, if legitimate and seasonable, is sufficient

to exclude the idea of an intention to injure, but when language has been used which,

regarded by itself and in connection with surrounding circumstances, constitutes ex

facie an injury, the allegation that the words were used merely as a joke of a legitimate

nature must be made good by the defendant by sufficiently convincing evidence.

The judgment of Pereira J., said, The words occur in a postscript to a letter written by

the defendant addressed to the firm of Messrs. Julius & Creasy, and they are as

follows: "Is there any truth in the report that Mr. Creasy has turned Muhammadan

and married Mrs. Cantlay? We would like to send them both a present."

His lordship also said, The burden was on the plaintiff to show that the words

referred to above were by themselves defamatory of the plaintiff. This she has done by

proving the following facts. That Mr. Creasy referred to in the words is Mr. Creasy, a

member of the firm of Messrs. Julius & Creasy, who had at one time acted as the

plaintiff's proctor in a legal proceeding; that Mr. Creasy is an elderly gentleman,

married, and having children; that Mrs. Cantlay referred to in the words is the

plaintiff, and that she is a widow of the age of 54 years; with several grown-up

children. Looked at in the light of these facts, there is no question that the words

referred to are defamatory of both the plaintiff and Mr. Creasy.

9 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

He added, the defendant, it has been proved, was not in such friendly terms with

Mr. Creasy as to justify him in indulging at the expense of Mr. Creasy in such a course

and vulgar joke, if joke it be, as that contained in the postscript; and the evidence

shows that the relations between the defendant and the plaintiff were decidedly

strained. In these circumstances, I cannot bring myself to think that the postscript

was a legitimate or seasonable joke. It was rather a venomed dart intended to hit and

hurt.

In GULICK v. GEEEN, (1918) The letter contained the following passage: ' "Why on

earth didn't you tell me Gulick was half a German, indeed three parts a German? I

grant I should have asked you, but it never occurred to me that there would be any

loose Germans about these days."

Shaw J., said, There appears to me to be very little difference between the English

and Roman-Dutch law relating to the proof of " malice " or " animus injuriandi" in

actions for defamation, and such difference as there is does not affect the particular

circumstances of the present case.

Although " malice " on the part. of the defendant has always nominally been an

ingredient to actional defamation under the English law, it has long ceased so to be in

fact, and, in the absence of privilege, the mere proof that the words are false and

defamatory constitutes irrebuttable proof of malice in law, and the defendant's

intention or motive in using the words is immaterial, if he has, in fact, wrongfully

injured the plaintiff's reputation

His lordship also said, What difference there is in the two systems of jurisprudence is

thus stated by Sir Henry de Villiers in Botha v. Brink 4: "The rule of the Roman-Dutch

law differs, if at all, from that of the English law in allowing greater latitude in

disproving malice. Under both systems the mere use of defamatory words affords

presumptive proof of malice, but under our law, as I understand it, the presumption

may be rebutted, not only by the fact that the communication was a privileged one, in

"which case express malice must be proved, but by such other circumstances

(examples of which are given in Voet 47, 10, 20) as satisfy the Court that the ' animus

injuriandi ' did not exist."

10 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

He added, When, therefore, the occasion is a privileged one, under both' systems the

presumption of malice, or " animus injuriandi " is rebutted, and it lies upon the

plaintiff to prove actual malice, and this is not; done by merely proving the words to

have been untrue, or even that the words used were stronger than the occasion

required. It is necessary to show that the state of mind of the defendant was

malicious. To quote the words of Coleridge J. in Harrison v. Bush 1: As the occasion

privileged the publication, the plaintiff had to give evidence of express malice. To do

this he was entitled to prove that the allegations in the libel were untrue. I do not say

that the mere fact of the falsehood of the allegations would prove express malice. I

agree that the material question was as to the state of the defendant's mind. "

The next two passages are also quoted since they are very relevant, The law is also

very clearly laid down by Lord Esher M.R. in Nevill v. Fine Arts and General Insurance

Company -; "For a very long time past Judges have over and over again directed juries

that the defence that the occasion was privileged can only be rebutted by showing that

the defendant in using the privileged occasion has used it with actual malice, or '

express ' malice as it has been sometimes called. Exception has been taken to the

latter term; but I think that the Judges using it have always explained its meaning to

the jury by telling them in substance that there must have been actual malice, which

is a state of mind. " This state of mind may be proved in various ways: by showing

personal animosity on the part of the defendant against the plaintiff; by showing that

the defendant knew that the statements made were untrue; by showing that the

statements were so reckless that the plaintiff could have had no bona fide belief in

their truth, and even by the defendant persisting in the truth of the statements at the

trial when he knew of their untruth, but not from the mere fact that the words used

were too strong (see Lopis L.J. in Nevill v. Fine Arts and General Insurance Company,

at page 170).

Before examining the decision, if any, the decision of the Privy Council, with

regard to aforesaid submissions, it is pertinent to deduce, propositions that

can be drawn from the discussion aforementioned.

(1) Although there exist similarities between the concept of malice in English

law and animus injuriandi in Roman Dutch Law, it has been cautioned,

11 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

at least in certain cases, the difficulties that could have arisen because of

indiscriminate confusion between the two,

(2) Unlike in English law, where defences are stereotype such as justification,

fair comment, privilege, jest, rixa, compensatio and mistake, in Roman

Dutch law, the absence of animus injuriandi simpliciter could be a

defence; in that, there is a possibility of giving birth to a new kind of a

defence which will be created in the attempt of the defendant to prove that

he had no animus injuriandi (the intention to cause injury),

(3) The absence of animus injuriandi (and also its presence) could be depicted

in a Venn Diagram usually used in Boolean Algebra which will be,

Set A is Presence of animus injuriandi,

Set B is Absence of animus injuriandi,

Set C can be Justification,

Set D can be Fair Comment,

Set E can be privilege,

Set F can be jest, likewise there can be

Set G

Set H

12 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

C

B: Absence of animus injuriandi

DA: Presence of Animus EF

The undefined area outside set A and not within any defined set, represents

the potential to produce new defences, or which can be used just as the

absence of animus injuriandi. The ability to prove absence of animus

injuriandi simpliciter, as a defence, is especially shown by the decisions in

Silva vs. Raman Chetty (1895), David vs Bell (1913) and Cantlay vs.

Vanderspar (1914).

The passage reproduced below, from the judgment of Lord Uthwatt, in the Privy

Council shows that their Lordships accepted the argument of Mr. Pritt, that

absence of animus injuriandi, without falling into any stereotype defence, can

be a defence.

In Roman Dutch Law animus injuriandi is an essential element in

proceedings for defamation. Where the words used are defamatory of the

complainant, the burden of negativing animus injuriandi rests upon the

defendant. The course of development of Roman Dutch Law in Ceylon has, put

broadly, been to recognise as defences those matters which under the inapt

name of privilege and the apt name of fair comment have in the course of the

history of the common law come to be recognised as affording defences to

proceedings for defamation. But it must be emphasised that those defences or,

more accurately, the principles which underlie them, find their technical setting

in Roman Dutch Law as matters relevant to negativing animus injuriandi. In

that setting they are perhaps capable of a wider scope than that accorded to

them by the common law. Decisions under the common law are indeed of the

greatest value in exemplifying the principles but do not necessarily mark out

rules under the Roman Dutch Law. The gladsome light of Roman

jurisprudence once shone on the common law: repayment to the successor of

the Roman Law should not take the form of obscuring one of its leading

principles.

However, Nagalingam A.C.J., decided in Associated Newspapers of Ceylon

Ltd., et al vs. Dr. C. H. Gunasekera (1952) 53 NLR 481, that Lord Uthwatt

13 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

has not expressly said in M. G. Perera vs. A. V. Peiris [1948] that absence of

animus injuriandi simpliciter is a defence, but decided that case on privilege.

The summary of this case said, The two defendants who were the proprietor

and editor respectively of a newspaper published certain defamatory excerpts

concerning the plaintiff from an inchoate and unpublished report of a special

committee which had been appointed by the Colombo Municipal Council to

investigate and report upon the administration of certain activities of the Public

Health Department, the head of which was the plaintiff. In the action for

defamation instituted by the plaintiff the defendants did not rely upon the

please of justification, fair comment or privilege. It was contended that it would

be sufficient for the defendants to prove the absence of animus injuriandi

simpliciter.

The learned District Judge entered judgment against the defendants for Rs.

5,000/- and the defendants appealed. Nagalingam A. C. J., said,

The basis of the contention of the appellants is the Privy Council case

of Perera vs. Peiris 1 [(1948) 50 NLR 145]. It is said that this case lays

down the proposition that although the defence may not be co related to

qualified privilege as understood prior to the delivering of that judgment,

the naked establishment of the absence of an intention to cause hurt

would absolve the defendants. I do not think that the judgment of Lord

Uthwatt lays down any such proposition. It is true that the judgment is

very much advanced of the views held previously, but nevertheless it is

clear to discern that some sort of privilege, although not necessarily one

of the express forms of qualified privilege as understood prior thereto,

had to be made out. The noble Lord in the course of his judgment stated

that their Lordships:

preferred to relate their conclusions to the wide general principle

which underlies the defence of privilege in all its aspects rather

14 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

than to debate the question whether the case falls within some

specific category and proceeded to state that the wide general

principle was as stated in Macintosh vs. Dun 1[(1908) A. C. 390] to

be the common convenience and welfare of society or the general

interest of society. The noble Lord further made the observation:

If it appears that it is to the public interest that the particular

report should be published privilege will attach.

Nagalingam A. C. J., also said, It is then said that what a defendant need now

do is disprove the existence of animus injuriandi and this he could do without

reference to any of the set forms of defence hitherto recognized by establishing

that he had no intention to cause hurt to the plaintiff. He is no longer required,

it is submitted, to prove even that the publication was in public interest

Learned Counsel for the appellant was driven to adopt this argument as it was

clear that the report as shewn above was one which was not even discussed by

the Council and the case of De Buse and others vs. McCarty and Stepney

Borough Council 1 [(1942) 1 All E. R. 19], a judgment of the Court of Appeal,

was a strong authority which it was not possible for the appellant to surmount.

The Report was at best that of a Committee which was only entitled to present

its findings to the Council and until at least the stage was reached of the

Council discussing it and passing a resolution thereon, it could not be said

that members of the public had any interest in it, much less in the

animadversions passed on the plaintiff: the publication, it was therefore clear,

was not one made for the common convenience and welfare of Society.

The reader may note, that in Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd., et al vs.

Dr. C. H. Gunasekera (1952) as well as De Buse and others vs. McCarty and

Stepney Borough Council [1941] there were committees appointed by the

respective Councils. The publication of the defamatory article was prior to the

committees report to the Councils and the latter take a decision, nay, even

discussing on it. Hence it was decided that the public has not yet an interest

15 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

on reading it. That is why in both cases the defendants failed. As this shows,

another salient aspect of the delict of defamation, the public having an

interest to read, the case of De Buse and others vs. McCarty and Stepney

Borough Council [1941] will be considered.

In that case, prior to the report of the special committee appointed to inquire a

theft, was considered by the Council, in giving notice of the Council meeting,

the names of the appellants as involved in the alleged theft, were included and

the notices were sent to the public libraries in the borough and was also affixed

on or near the door of the town hall.

The town clerk and the Council were the defendants. Wrottersley J., found in

favour of the defendants and the plaintiffs appealed.

Lord Greene, M.R. referred to a dictum of Lord Atkinson in Adam vs. Ward

[1917] A.C. 309 and quoted what is below,

It was not disputed, in this case on either side, that a privileged

occasion is, in reference to qualified privilege an occasion where the

person who makes a communication has an interest or a duty, legal,

social or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made and the

person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to

receive it. This reciprocity is essential.

Goddard L.J., said,

It might well be, also, that highly confidential documents would be

received by the Council and would have to be considered at a Council

meeting. For instance, complaints in regard to the conduct of a high

official might be made direct to the Minister of Health by some

disgruntled ratepayer. The Ministry of Health might send off that

complaint, which might be wholly libellous and which might do untold

damage to the individual and ask Councils observations upon it. Can it

be said that the Council would be justified in publishing that letter which

16 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

they received from the Minister of Health, or from any other government

department, merely because they were going to take it into consideration

at their meeting? They might come to the conclusion that it was

absolutely groundless. I can see no ground whatever for saying that the

occasion on which the document was published comes within the orbit of

the privilege which attaches to the occasions on which documents are

published have a common interest. In my opinion, there is no ground

whatever for saying that this was a privileged occasion and consequently,

the appeal succeeds.

By the cases of Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd., et al vs. Dr. C. H.

Gunasekera (1952) and De Buse and others vs. McCarty and Stepney

Borough Council [1941] one more proposition could be deduced. That is,

4. To succeed in a plea of privilege, there should be a duty, legal. Social or

moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made and the person to whom it

is so made should have a corresponding interest or duty to receive it; this

reciprocity is essential.

The reader might wonder as to why no reference to facts of the case up to now.

They will be referred to, presently.

The newspaper called The Observer, dated 11.06.1992 stated thus,

Welfare Fund Colonel Sacked.

Army cleanup exposes Rs. 8 million racket.

Lt. Gen. Cecil Waidyaratne Army Commander in Sweeping Reforms to

Army, has sacked Colonel M. Dissanayake who was the Director of Welfare

Fund for the Soldiers. This was after the discovery that Rs. 8 million had gone

missing from the Welfare Fund of the soldiers. After the initial Army inquiry,

the C. I. D. has been called in to carry out further investigations.

The newspaper called Janatha of 11.06.1992 stated thus,

Just prior to the retirement from active service (in an administrative capacity)

at the age of fifty five, in the Army, the plaintiff, Mr. Mahinda Dissanayake

(referred to in aforesaid news items) was appointed in 1988 as the Director of

Army Welfare Division. He has said that since he did not get monetary

allocations from the government, as per his experience he started to collect Rs.

500/- each from those who volunteer (page 123,124 of the appeal brief). He has

said that there was internal audit of the Welfare Division (page 125 of the

appeal brief). In the first year the collection was Rs. 16 million (page 126,127 of

the appeal brief). He received a transfer with effect from 31.03.1992 (page

135,136 of the appeal brief). He was transferred to the 3rd Battalion (page 136

of the appeal brief). He wrote a letter dated 08.06.1992 to the Army

Commander which was marked and produced as P.08 (page 138 of the appeal

brief). It is a four paged letter. He has recited, in the said letter, regarding

activities he performed in the Welfare Division (page 139 of the appeal brief)

and having expressed his displeasure regarding the way he was transferred, he

has requested to post him in the Reserve Service. He came to know with regard

to the aforesaid news items through his daughter working in Air Lanka (at page

140 of the appeal brief). The said news item reported that the Colonel in charge

of the Welfare Division has been sacked (at page 141 of the appeal brief). He

says he was not dismissed (at page 142 of the appeal brief). He could not work

the way he used to work, after the publication of the news item because he felt

that people did not have the same respect and regard towards him (at page 149

of the appeal brief). There was no disciplinary action against him (at page 152

of the appeal brief). After the transfer, he was posted as the Additional

18 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

Government Agent in Jaffna (at page 153 of the appeal brief). The aforesaid was

said in examination in chief.

Under cross examination, he said that all his medals were awarded not while in

service in battle front but while in service in administrative branch (page 170 of

the appeal brief). From July 1988 to 31.03.1992 he functioned as the Director

of Army Welfare Division (at page 171 of the appeal brief). He left Army (ayin

wuna) on 16.08.1992 (at page 172 of the appeal brief). He accepted, when

suggested, that being in charge of the administration of Jaffna is a higher post

than the Director, Army Welfare Division (at page 173 of the appeal brief). After

the transfer of the plaintiff from the Army Welfare Division, the Army

Commander has given the administration of that Division to a Board (at page

180,181 of the appeal brief). The question and answer reproduced below was

recorded (at page 185 of the appeal brief).

Q. Now, you have stated in page 02 of P.08 that you were stopped from

functioning as the Director of the (Army) Welfare Division from 31st March

1992?

A. Yes, correct.

He again accepted this, at the last question and answer recorded three pages

later (at page 188 of the appeal brief).

The questions and answers reproduced below were recorded thereafter (at page

190,191 of the appeal brief). For clarity they are reproduced in Sinhalese, the

language in which they were recorded.

Q. Dotta daanawa kiyanne eliyata daanawa needa?

A. Owe.

Q. Ehemane thamaata wune?

A. Mata ehema deyak wune nehe.

19 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

Q. Mama yojana karanawa subasadaka mandalayen elyiata daala

aapasu gaththe nehe kiyala?

A. Maawa elyiata demme nehe.

Q. Thama dotta demma?

A. Maawa dotta demme nehe. Maawa maaru kala.

When it was suggested to him that the Army Commander ordered that he shall

relinquish his duties as the Director, Army Welfare Division with effect from

31.03.1992, he accepted (at page 192 of the appeal brief).

The next witness, called for the plaintiff, was Mr. Thambipillai Shiva

Shanmugam, retired Major General.

Under cross examination, when he was asked whether he knows that the

plaintiff was suddenly removed from the post of Director (Army) Welfare

Division in March 1992, his answer was that it was a routine transfer (at page

207 of the appeal brief). Then he was asked whether P.08 could be the

response of a person who received a routine transfer (page 208 of the appeal

brief). He was asked the questions, reproduced below (at page 211 of the

appeal brief)

Q. Not only a Board of Governance was appointed by P.05, it has been

questioned regarding the stock in hand, cash in hand and bank statements,

properties, debtors and creditors, investments and newly opened books?

A. It so happens at the transition of administration, of a Welfare Fund

or an Institution.

..

Q. Why all this was necessary? Why a single person was mot appointed

in the place of Mr. Dissanayake? Why it has been directed to effect this

handing over of things?

20 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

A. I cannot answer those questions. It could be the policy of the new

Army Commander.

He admitted that he had heard rumors of certain irregularities took place in the

(Army) Welfare Fund, during the relevant period (at page 213 of the appeal

brief).

The next witness called for the plaintiff was Mr. Landage Ajith Pushpakantha

Gunasekera a Major. He was a Chartered Accountant. The objective of calling

him was to show that accounts in the Army Welfare Fund were properly

maintained.

He too admitted that there were rumors that in 1992 irregularities have taken

place in the (Army) Welfare Division (at page 224 of the appeal brief). He also

said that the Board of Management (Governors) consisted of Brigadier

Munasinghe, Colonel Gunathunga, Colonel Ariyarathna and Luitinent

Wijesuriya (at page 225 of the appeal brief).

The next witness, called for the plaintiff was Mr. Franklin Bernard Hendricus,

the Senior Manager of Shirley Ganegoda and Company, Chartered

Accountants. The accounts of the (Army) Welfare Fund were kept by them.

He accepted that as a responsible accountant, there should be an assets

register, but it was not there and it is an error (at page 235 of the appeal brief).

He accepted that Rs. 3 million has been shown as hire purchase debtors and if

it is in violation of the regulations (Constitution) of the (Army) Welfare Fund, it

is an error (at page 235,236 of the appeal brief).

He accepted that the Cash Book and the Bank Account Register will not tally

and it is because it has not been properly accounted and that it has been said

that what became of certain moneys were not known (at page 237 of the appeal

brief). He admitted that there is no Ledger on Purchases and Sales (at page 239

of the appeal brief). He admitted that the Audit Report pertaining to 1990 has

not been certified by his Institution (at page 244 of the appeal brief). He

21 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

accepted that in P.03 too there is no certification by his Institution as a correct

account report (at page 245 of the appeal brief).

Thus concluded the plaintiffs case.

The defence proposed to call one Mr. Segu Junaid Mohamed Nizam, but it was

objected to, on the basis that he was not listed. While arguing that he can be

called without being listed, since he was the agent of the defendant, the

defendant however withdrew the motion to call him as a witness. The defence

closed its case marking documents D.01 to D.04.

Thus concluded the trial.

It has been submitted for the plaintiff that the defence did not call witnesses to

prove justification, that is to say, that what was published was true. But even

the plaintiffs and his witnesses evidence show,

(1) That there was information about irregularities or corruption in (Army)

Welfare Fund and there was an investigation by the Army Commander,

(2) As a result, the plaintiff was removed from his post as the Director of

that division,

(3) The evidence of plaintiffs witness, Mr. Thambipillai Shiva Shanmugam,

that it was a routine transfer is contradicted by plaintiffs own letter P.08

which ran into 04 pages by which the plaintiff has protested against his

transfer,

(4) The accounts of the (Army) Welfare Fund have not been kept properly,

(5) The official audit, Shirley Ganegoda Company has not audited certain

accounts,

It was seen that in N. W. de Costa vs. The Times of Ceylon (1963),

Basnayake C. J., said,

At the same time I do not wish to be understood as saying that under no

circumstances should we examine the decisions of courts of other jurisdictions

22 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

when called upon to solve an intricate question of law in our system. But the

tendency to resort to English and American treatises and decisions without first

endeavouring to solve the problems that arise according to Roman-Dutch, law

should be resisted.

Hence, it is pertinent to consider the judgment in Adam vs. Ward [1917]

which was referred to in De Buse and others vs. McCarty and Stepney

Borough Council [1941].

Adam vs Ward [1917] is a judgment of House of Lords, having it the speeches

made by Lord Finlay L. C., Earl Loreburn, Lord Dunedin, Lord Atkinson and

Lord Shaw of Dunfermline.

The facts of the case were,

Major Adam, the plaintiff and appellant, was an officer in the 5th Lancers, in

1906, stationed at Aldershot. The commanding officer of his regiment was

Colonel Graham, who in the autumn of 1906 made a confidential report with

regard to Major Adam. This report was submitted to Major General Scobell

and was by him transmitted, together with notes of his own upon it, to

General Sir John French, who was General Officer Commanding in Chief at

Aldershot. This report, with notes upon it, is in the evidence called the

combined report. It was not shown to Major Adam before being sent in, as it

ought to have been by the Kings Regulations, but it was shown to him some

weeks later about 6 December 1906. On 3 November 1906, Sir John French

sent in a confidential report of his own with regard to Major Adam. Neither of

these reports was produced at the trial, as the Secretary of State stated that it

was contrary to the public interest that they should be put in evidence.

A letter dated 1 December 1906, was sent from the Army Council to Sir John

French, stating with reference to a letter of his of 3 November, reporting the

unsuitability of Major Adam as a cavalry leader in the field, that after full

consideration of the circumstances of the case it had been decided that he

23 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

should be called upon to forward an application to retire from the Service,

failing which it would be necessary to submit for His Majestys approval his

removal from the Army and that Sir John French was requested to

communicate this decision to Major Adam. Major Adam wrote begging for a

reconsideration of this decision, or, failing that, for the longest possible grace

before sending in his papers, in order that he might get something to do and

in the result, owing to the good offices of Major General Scobell, Major Adam

was given a post in the office of the Chief of the General Staff. He remained at

this post until January 1910. On 18 October 1907, it was announced that he

and four other officers were to be placed on half pay and on 30 November of

the same year a communique appeared stating that this action was not due to

any cause detrimental to the character of these officers and that, though they

were not considered suitable to retain their positions as officers in the 5th

Lancers, their services could be and in three cases were being, utilized in

other appointments and that the regiment was not inefficient to take the

field.

In October 1909, Major Adam asked that the circumstances under which he

was placed on half pay should be reconsidered with a view to his

reinstatement on full pay, but he was informed by a letter of 3 November that

his case had been carefully considered and that the Army Council saw no

reason to reopen the question.

In January 1910, Major Adam was returned as member of the House of

Commons for Woolwich and vacated his staff appointment.

On 27 June 1910, he made a speech in the House of Commons in which he

referred to the case of Captain Bryce Wilson, one of the five officers who had

been placed on half pay and read out in the house the following statement:

That Major General H. J. Scobell, Royal Irish Lancers, did render to superior

authority a confidential report or confidential reports on an officer or officers

under his command, which report or reports contained wilful and deliberate

24 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

misstatements of fact, thereby deceiving those in authority to whom the

report or reports were rendered and causing injustice to be done to one of the

regiments under his command.

Major Adam then went on to say, according to the report in Hansard, which

was in evidence: Major General Scobell is on his way home at the present

time from South Africa. He arrives in England at the end of this week and I

hope when he sees the report of this paper, as I intend he shall do, he will

appreciate the meaning of the words, willful and deliberate misstatement of

facts. I have tried to make it clear and I hope he will turn up that paragraph

in the Kings Regulations which compels an officer in a case like this to refer

the matter to his superior authority, the superior authority in this case being

the Army Council. I hope sincerely that the Army Council will see that justice

is done to Captain Wilson and that penalties are meted out to those officers

who deserve it.

In reference to this speech the Lord Chancellor said: This speech must have

conveyed to every one who heard it or read the report the impression that

Major General Scobell was charged with conduct unworthy of an officer and a

gentleman within the meaning of Kings Regulations. It is impossible to

suppose that Major Adam did not intend to convey this impression. At the

trial, however, he stated that he did not impute such unworthy conduct to

Major General Scobell and that he said what he did merely in order that Major

General Scobell might demand an inquiry to clear himself, in the course of

which Major Adam believed information might be obtained with regard to the

attack upon him which he believed to be contained in the combined report.

I abstain from comment upon Major Adams conduct in making, for such an

indirect purpose, an unfounded attack upon General Scobell, who had

rendered Major Adam great service at the time of his removal.

25 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

His Lordship then continued: Major General Scobell brought the matter

before the Army Council, who, after investigating it, issued through the Press

the letter which is complained of as a libel upon Major Adam and which forms

the subject of this action. It was addressed to Major General Scobell and is as

follows:-

In reply to your letter of 8th July 1910, asking that an inquiry should

be instituted in regard to a statement made by Major W.A. Adam M. P.,

in the House of Commons on 27th June to the effect that while in the

command of the 1st Cavalry Brigade you rendered confidential reports on

certain officers which reports contained willful and deliberate

misstatements of facts, I am commanded by the Army Council to inform

you that a thorough investigation has been made of the reports made by

you at that time on certain officers of the 5th Lancers, who were

afterwards removed from the regiment and to whom it is believed that

Major Adams statement bore reference. Major Adam is himself one of

these officers. The Council also thought it proper to address a letter to

Major Adam on the 23rd ultimo, inquiring whether he desired to forward

for their consideration any statement in amplification or substantiation

of his charge against you. On the 29th idem a reply was received from

Major Adam to the effect that he had written to the Secretary of State for

War on the subject, but his letter of the same date to the Secretary of

State is found to contain nothing pertinent to the present investigation.

The Council are satisfied that not only did your reports contain the

unbiased and conscientious opinion you had formed on the officers in

question, but that the conclusions at which you arrived were correct, as

they were afterwards borne out not only by the opinion of your successor

in command of the 1st Cavalry Brigade, but also by a special report on

the 5th Lancers made by H.R.H. the then Inspector General of the Forces

and confirmed by the General Officer then Commanding in Chief the

26 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

Aldershot Command. Further, as showing the absence of hostile bias, the

Army Council note that in the case of Major Adam, who in 1906 was

called upon to retire from the service in consequence of adverse reports,

which were duly communicated to him, you intervened on his behalf and

urged the Council to give him another chance in an extra regimental

appointment. In the result it was decided to give Major Adam this

chance. I am to add that the Council are of opinion that the charge

brought against you by Major Adam is without foundation.

The action was brought on 14 November 1912, against Sir E. Ward, by

whom, as secretary to the Army Council, the letter complained of had been

signed and issued to the Press in obedience to the orders of the Army Council.

The defendant did not dispute that the letter was defamatory of the plaintiff

but pleaded privilege.

Sir Hugh Fraser, for the appellant (plaintiff) said,

There is no duty to publish to the world at large untrue defamatory

statements unless they are protected by statue or are contained in a

report of parliamentary or judicial proceedings, or proceedings in the

nature of a judicial inquiry: Purcell v. Sowler (1) ; Brown v. Croome (2) ;

Lay v. Lawson. (3).

Lord Finlay L.C. in his judgment said,

Malice is a necessary element in action for libel, but from the

mere publication of defamatory matter malice is implied, unless the

publication was on what is called a privileged occasion. If the

communication was made in pursuance of a duty or on a matter in

which there was a common interest on the party making and the

party receiving it, the occasion is said to be privileged. This

privilege is only qualified and may be rebutted by proof of express

malice.

27 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

Earl Loreburn said,

But the fact that an occasion is privileged does not necessarily protect

all that is said or written on that occasion. Anything that is not relevant

and pertinent to the discharge of the duty or the exercise of the right or

the safeguarding of the interest which creates the privilege will not be

protected.

His Lordship further said,

I will only add that when one part of a liable is held to be protected by

privilege and the other part not protected the jury ought to be told that

they cannot give damages in respect of the first part at all, unless they

are satisfied that it was malicious, which may be proved by the character

of the unprotected part or by other evidence.

Lord Dunedin said,

I only venture to add some remarks of my own, because some of

the leading principles of the law of libel and privilege have been

freely discussed, and this case will take rank in the future as an

authoritative pronouncement on these matters.

His Lordship added,

Strictly speaking, it is the occasion on which a statement is made that

is privileged, and the phrase that such and such a statement is

privileged would be more accurately, though perhaps, more clumsily,

expressed by saying that, the statement having been made on a

privileged occasion, malice cannot be implied from defamatory

expressions therein, but must be proved as a real fact. The malice to be

proved must be real malice, and is generally called express malice to

distinguish it from the malice which is implied from the defamatory

words themselves.

28 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

Lord Atkinson, referring to the learned Judge who tried the case said,

He did not leave the question of privilege or no privilege to the jury,

but he did leave to the jury the question as to the presence or absence of

the elements which go to create privilege. For instance, the question

Was the subject matter of the publication by the defendant matter about

which it was proper for the public to know? And the question Was the

matter contained in the letter proper for the public to know? It is to be

regretted that the remarks of Willes J., in Henwood vs. Harrison (1) were

not brought to Darling J.s notice. Willes J., a most learned, laborious

and accurate Judge, after stating that since the Declaratory Act of 1792

(32 Geo. 3, c. 60) the jury are the proper tribunal in civil as in criminal

cases to decide the question of libel or no libel, said: But it is not

competent for the jury to find that, upon a privileged occasion, relevant

remarks made bona fide without malice are libellous. He then proceeds:

It would be abolishing the law of privileged discussion and asserting the

duty of the Court to decide upon this as upon any other question of law,

if we were to hand over the decision of privilege or no privilege to the

jury. A jury, according to their individual views of religion or policy,

might hold the Church, the Army, the Navy, Parliament itself, to be

of no national or general importance, or the liberty of the Press to

be of less consequence than the feelings of a thin-skinned

disputant. It was not disputed, in this case on either side, that a

privileged occasion is, in reference to qualified privilege, an occasion

where the person who makes a communication has an interest or a duty,

legal, social or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made, and

the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to

receive it. This reciprocity is essential.

29 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

The aforesaid passage shows that the question whether there is privilege or not

is a question of law. It was having referred to the quotation from Willes J., Lord

Atkinson said his oft quoted passage which is,

It was not disputed, in this case on either side, that a privileged

occasion is, in reference to qualified privilege, an occasion where the

person who makes a communication has an interest or a duty, legal,

social or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made, and the

person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to

receive it. This reciprocity is essential.

Lord Atkinson also said,

It was however, strenuously contended on the part of the

appellant, as I understood, that the language used in a

communication made on a privileged occasion must, if it is to be

protected, merely be such as is reasonably necessary to enable the

party making it to protect the interest or discharge the duty upon

which the qualified privilege is founded. It has long been established

by unquestioned and unquestionable authority, I think, that this is

not the law. This point is of such importance that one may be

excused for referring at length to three authorities to show what the

law on the subject really is , and in what light the language used in

privileged communications is in a Court of law to be regarded.

Lord Atkinson then referred to, Spill vs. Maule, L. R. 4 Ex.232, Laughton vs.

Bishop of Sodor and Man, L. R. 4 P. C. 495 and Jenoure vs. Delmage, [1891] A.

C. 73. In Spill vs. Maule, it was argued, that though the communication was

privileged, yet the violent and abusive terms used in the letter were evidence of

actual malice. The judgment of Lord Atkinson then said,

The judgement of the Exchequer Chamber was delivered by Cockburn

C.J., Keating, Lush, Hannen, Hayes, and Brett JJ. Concurring. The case

30 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

is therefore one of high authority. After stating the facts the Chief Justice

said (2) : The question then arises, whether the language is too

strong for the occasion ; the terms applied to the plaintiffs conduct

being most disgraceful and dishonest. Now, the communication being

privileged, the presumption is in favor of the absence of malice in

the defendant, and in order to rebut this presumption, the plaintiff

must show actual malice, and he may no doubt show this by

reference to the terms of the libel as being utterly beyond and

disproportionate to the facts. He then proceeds to refer to the

plaintiffs act in taking away the bills, and says This act was capable of a

twofold construction; it might have taken place under such

circumstances that the plaintiff could not properly be exposed to any

moral censure, as for instance, if he only intended to keep the assets in

security for the benefit of creditors: or the circumstances might have

been such that in taking the bills he acted dishonestly and disgracefully.

Now, the presumption of the law being in favor of the absence of malice

in the defendant and the only evidence of malice being his description of

acts done by the plaintiff, which were capable of a twofold construction.

That presumption of innocence which attaches to the writer must also,

while his act is capable of a double aspect, still attend him.

We have not to deal with the question whether the plaintiff did or

did not act dishonestly and disgracefully: all we have to examine is

whether the defendant stated no more than what he believed, and

what he might reasonably believe; if he stated no more than this, he

is not liable, and, unless proof to the contrary is produced, we must

take it that he did state no more. The direction of Martin B. was

accordingly upheld.

Having referred to the other two cases too, Lord Atkinson said,

31 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

These authorities, in my view, clearly establish that a person

making a communication on a privileged occasion is not restricted

to the use of such language ,merely as is reasonably necessary to

protect the interest or discharge the duty which is the foundation of

his privilege; but that, on the contrary, he will be protected , even

though his language should be violent or excessively strong, if ,

having regard to all the circumstances of the case, he might have

honestly and on reasonable grounds believed that what he wrote or

said was true and necessary for the purpose of his vindication

though in fact it was not so.

What Lord Atkinson said in His Lordships judgment, which is reproduced

below, will be applicable to the facts of the present case too.

It must be remembered that every subject of the Crown, whatever

portion of our far-flung Empire he may inhabit, has, and must have,

an interest in the British Army, its courage, the confidence of its

men in their officers, its discipline and efficiency amongst other

reasons, that he never can be sure whether the day may not come

when the lives of himself and his family, the safety of his property

or his liberty may not depend on its success in the field against the

Empires enemies, or the efficiency of its aid of the civil power in

suppressing tumult and crime in the locality where he lives. The

efficiency and discipline of troops must depend on the character,

training, and acquirements of the officers who lead them.

The last judgment in the case being that of Lord Shaw of Dunfermline, it is apt

to reproduce a sentimental expression of His Lordship, just to show that the

Member of Parliament, Adam brought the action on defamation, after the death

of Major General Scobell.

32 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

On investigation the charge was found to be baseless. The result was a

complete acquittal of Major-General Scobell. In February, 1912, that

gallant officer died. After his death, namely, in November, 1912, this

action was brought.

Lord Shaw also added,

Privilege is a term which is applied in two senses. There is a privileged

occasion and there is also said to be a privileged communication. The

former expression is correct; the latter, strictly viewed, tends to error.

Lord Shaw further said,

The leading place in authority is still held by Toogood vs. Sprying. The

most valuable judgment of Willes J., in Henwood vs. Harrison gathers

the decisions together, including, especially Toogood and Harrisson vs.

Bush and Whiteley vs. Adams and sums them up in these terms: The

principle upon which these cases are founded is a universal one, that

the public convenience is to be preferred to private interests and

that communications which the interest of society require to be

unfettered may freely be made by persons acting honestly without actual

malice, notwithstanding that they involve relevant comments

condemnatory of individuals.

In regard to public convenience, one has to consider the case of Reynolds v

Times Newspapers Ltd and Others decided in 1998.

The English Court of Appeal said in Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd and

Others delivered on 8 July 1998 as follows:

We do not for an instant doubt that the common convenience and welfare of

a modern plural democracy such as ours are best served by an ample flow of

information to the public concerning, and by vigorous public discussion of

matters of public interest to the community. By that we mean matters relating

33 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

to the public life of the community and those who take part in it, including within

the expression ''public life'' activities such as the conduct of government and

political life, elections . . . and public administration, but we use the expression

more widely than that, to embrace matters such as (for instance) the governance of

public bodies, institutions and companies which give rise to a public interest in

disclosure, but excluding matters which are personal and private, such that there

is no public interest in their disclosure. Recognition that the common convenience

and welfare of society are best served in this way is a modern democratic

imperative which the law must accept. In differing ways and to somewhat differing

extents the law has recognised this imperative, in the United States, Australia, New

Zealand and elsewhere, as also in the jurisprudence of the European Court of

Human Rights. . . . As it is the task of the news media to inform the public and

engage in public discussion of matters of public interest, so is that to be recognised

as its duty. The cases cited show acceptance of such a duty, even where

publication is by a newspaper to the public at large. . . . We have no doubt that the

public also have an interest to receive information on matters of public interest to

the community. . . .

In Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation, [1997] HCA 25; (1997) 189 CLR

520; (1997) 145 ALR 96; (1997) 71 ALJR 818, 8 July 1997, Brennan C. J. in the

joint judgment referring to the decision in Theophanous said,

" The purpose of the law of defamation is to strike a balance between the right to

reputation and freedom of speech". .

In Lingens v Austria, 1986 ECHR 07 the question before the European Court of

Human Rights was whether the impugned court decisions infringed Article 10

of the Convention, which read,

"1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include

freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without

interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. ...

34 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and

responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or

penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the

interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention

of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the

reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received

in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary."

Mr. Peter Michael Lingens was an Austrian national living in Vienna and the

editor of the magazine Profile. Mr. Bruno Kreisky, was the retiring Chancellor

and President of the Austrian Socialist Party. There were two articles published

by Lingens on 14th and 21st October 1975 after a general election when if was

expected that the retiring Chancellor would have to form a coalition with the

party of one Mr. Friedrich Peter, in order to stay in power. At this time

revelations had been made about Mr. Peter's Nazi past. The retiring Chancellor

defendant Mr. Peter and attached his detractor whose activities he described as

" mafia methods". The articles of Lingens criticized the retiring Chancellor for

protecting former Nazis using the expressions " basest opportunism", "

immoral" and " undignified". The retiring Chancellor instituted private

proceedings on defamation and the Vienna Regional Court holding that he had

been criticized in his private capacity fined Lingens. In appeal the judgment

was set aside on a question of law ordering the court to re-consider its

decision. It then re-affirmed its decision. However in the second appeal the fine

was reduced.

In Reynolds 02, Lord Hobhouse said,

" The law of civil defamation is directly concerned with the private law right not

to be unjustly deprived of one's reputation and recognises the defence of privilege.

The justification for this defence is at least in part based upon the needs of society.

It can sensibly be asked why society or the law of defamation should tolerate any

level of factual inaccuracy . The answer to this question is that any other approach

35 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

would simply be impractical. Complete factual accuracy may not always be

practically achievable nor may it always be possible definitely to establish what is

true and what is not. Truth is not in practice an absolute criterion . Nor are the

distinctions between what is fact and innuendo and comment always capable of a

delineation which leaves no room for disagreement or honest mistake. The free

discussion of opinions and the freedom to comment are inevitably liable to overlap

with factual assumptions and implications. Some degree of tolerance for factual

inaccuracy has to be accepted; hence the need for a law of privilege". - at page

43 -

It should be noted that considering the question of the abuse of the privilege,

that is, whether the defendant acted recklessly and irresponsibly, In Lange vs.

Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the New Zealand Court referred to, it

appears with some reservations, to what it identified as the restatement of

what constituted malice by Lord Diplock in Horrocks vs. Lowe, 1975, A. C. 135,

149-150. It said,

" What constituted malice was restated in Horrocks v Lowe [1975] AC 135, 149-150

by Lord Diplock, in what have since been regarded as authoritative terms. His

reference in that restatement to carelessness, impulsiveness or irrationality not

being equated to indifference, must be read in context. The proposition does not

qualify the preceding statements which cover lack of genuine belief and

recklessness. Thus while carelessness will not of itself be sufficient to negate the

defence, its existence may well support an assertion by the plaintiff of a lack of

belief or recklessness. In this way the concept of reasonable or responsible conduct

on the part of a defendant in the particular circumstances becomes a legitimate

consideration". - at paragraph 44 -

However it also said,

" Indifference to truth is, of course, not the same thing conceptually as failing to

take reasonable care with the truth but in practical terms they tend to shade into

36 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

each other. It is useful, when considering whether an occasion of qualified privilege

has been misused, to ask whether the defendant has exercised the degree of

responsibility which the occasion required". - at paragraph 46 -

Lord Diplock in Horrocks v Lowe [1975] AC 135, 149-150 said in His Lordship's

speech,

" The public interest that the law should provide an effective means whereby a man

can vindicate his reputation against calumny has nevertheless to be

accommodated to the competing public interest in permitting men to communicate

frankly and freely with one another about matters in respect of which the law

recognises that they have a duty to perform or an interest to protect in doing so.

What is published in good faith on matters of these kinds is published on a

privileged occasion. It is not actionable even though it be defamatory and

turns out to be untrue. With some exceptions which are irrelevant to the instant

appeal, the privilege is not absolute but qualified. It is lost if the occasion which

gives rise to it is misused". - at page 149 -

His Lordship also said in an oft quoted passage,

" But indifference to the truth of what he publishes is not to be equated with

carelessness, impulsiveness or irrationality in arriving at a positive belief that it is

true. The freedom of speech protected by the law of qualified privilege may be

availed of by all sorts and conditions of men. In affording to them immunity

from suit if they have acted in good faith in compliance with a legal or moral

duty or in protection of a legitimate interest the law must take them as it

finds them. In ordinary life it is rare indeed for people to form their beliefs by a

process of logical deduction from facts ascertained by a rigorous search for all

available evidence and a judicious assessment of its probative value. In greater or

in less degree according to their temperaments, their training, their intelligence,

they are swayed by prejudice, rely on intuition instead of reasoning, leap to

conclusions on inadequate evidence and fail to recognise the cogency of material

37 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

which might cast doubt on the validity of the conclusions they reach. But despite

the imperfection of the mental process by which the belief is arrived at it

may still be "honest," that is, a positive belief that the conclusions they have

reached are true. The law demands no more". - at page 150 -

The following passage appears to be relevant in the context of Roman Dutch

Law animus injuriandi too,

" Qualified privilege would be illusory, and the public interest that it is meant to

serve defeated, if the protection which it affords were lost merely because a person,

although acting in compliance with a duty or in protection of a legitimate interest,

disliked the person whom he defamed or was indignant at what he believed to be

that person's conduct and welcomed the opportunity of exposing it. It is only where

his desire to comply with the relevant duty or to protect the relevant interest plays

no significant part in his motives for publishing what he believes to be true that

"express malice" can properly be found". - at pages 150,151 -

The plaintiff in the present action has not been able to show that the defendant

harbored a grudge against him or had malicious intentions towards him. Then

malice is presumed on the defamatory statement. The presumption is

destroyed if there was a reciprocity of duty and interest. Usually this was not

for the public at large. However, there is information which the public has a

right to receive. The dissemination of such information to the public at large

therefore is privileged, the privilege destroying the presumption of malice.

Although the facts in the two cases, Derbyshire County Council (Appellants)

vs. Times Newspaper Limited and others (Respondents) [1993] AC 534 and

Dr. Gary Paul Duke, Appellant defendant vs. The University of Salford,

Respondent claimant are different, in the former the defendant being a local

authority and in the latter a university, in both cases the freedom of expression

was emphasized.

38 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

As per the aforementioned discussion, there is no animus injuriandi or

malice that could be inferred from the relevant newspaper articles, although

such terms as hamuda Colonel dotta, were used. The aforementioned

authorities show that the law permits such factual inaccuracies. Furthermore,

it cannot be said that it is inaccurate too, because the plaintiff was (although

it was a transfer) was actually removed from the position he held. His protest

by P.08 shows that even he considered it, as something similar to what

those newspaper articles said. It was said in Reynolds 02 by Lord Hobhouse,

Truth is not in practice an absolute criterion..

It is pertinent to note, what the author Rolf Dobelli says in his book Stop

Reading the News. [2020] He was, on 12th April 2013 invited by the Guardian

to talk about his book, The Art of Thinking Clearly. But, abruptly, the Editor

in Chief Alan Rusbridger, asked him to talk about Dobellis new article on his

website. Dobelli says, The article Rusbridger had found on my website listed

the most important arguments against consuming precisely what these

internationally respected professionals spent their days producing: the news.

Dobelli had to discard, his prepared speech and speak off the cuff, so to speak.

He says, Now, instead of standing in front of fifty people well disposed to me, I

was confronted by fifty opponents. Caught in the crossfire of their stares, I

tried to stay as calm as possible. After twenty minutes Id reached the end of

my argument, concluding with the words, Lets be honest: what youre

doing here, ladies and gentlemen, is basically entertainment.

Silence. You could have heard a pin drop. Rusbridger narrowed his eyes,

glanced around and said, Id like us to publish Mr. Dobellis arguments.

Today.

39 | DCF 593 2000 Judgment Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice Pradeep Kirthisinghe

He turned around and left the room without saying goodbye. The journalists

followed him. Nobody looked at me. Nobody said so much as a word.

Four hours later there was an abridged version of my article on the Guardian

website. Before long it had accrued 450 comments from readers the

maximum the website would allow. My piece, News is bad for you, was

paradoxically one of the most read newspaper articles of the year.

In the circumstances, the appeal of the defendant is allowed. The judgment of

the District Court is set aside. The action of the plaintiff is dismissed. This

Court makes no order on costs.
