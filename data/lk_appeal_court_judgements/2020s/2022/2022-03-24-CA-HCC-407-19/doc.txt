WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. The accused-appellant was indicted before the High Court of

Rathnapura with committing grave sexual abuse on or about

27.12.2007, an offence punishable under Section 365 B(2)(b) of the

Penal Code. After the trial, the appellant was convicted of the charge

and was sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment and imposed a

fine of Rs.25,000/-. It was also ordered to pay Rs.200,000/- as

compensation to the victim. This appeal is from the said conviction and

sentence.

At the time of this incident, the victim was a 15 years old boy. On

27.12.2007 evening, when the victim Mahesh Saman Kumara was

returning from his aunts place, the appellant caught him by the hand

on the road and took him to a hall in the Balangoda Municipal ground.

The accused-appellant was an unknown person to him. Mahesh was

taken to a room in the Municipal grounds and the appellant committed

this offence, according to the victim.

3

When Mahesh was coming after the incident, he met PW 9, the Police

officer Amarasinghe who was on night-petrol duty and was informed

about the incident. They had gone to the pavilion of the Municipal

grounds around 11.40 p.m. as shown by the victim, the watcher Pushpa

Kumara was in a room, and on information given by the watcher, they

had gone to the room where the accused was boarded. When the

accused came out from his room, the victim identified him as the person

who sexually abused him. The police officer arrested the accused-

appellant at 12.30 in the night and brought him to the police station.

Although four grounds of appeal have been stated in the written

submission tendered on behalf of the appellant, the learned counsel for

the appellant made his submissions only on the ground of false

implication of the accused-appellant. When making submissions

regarding the said ground, he contended that the identification of the

appellant by the victim is also doubtful.

In respect of the ground of false implication, the learned counsel for the

appellant contended that the police officers forced the victim to

implicate the appellant for this offence. In substantiating this

argument, the learned counsel pointed out two points. One point was

that there is no evidence, where the victim was from midnight to the

next morning. The other point was the prosecution story that the victim

had gone with police officers to the ground and shown the appellant

could not be believed.

It appears that where the victim was from the 27th midnight to the next

morning is not a material fact to prove the prosecution case. How the

offence was committed, how the victim showed the appellant to the

police officers after the incident and how the appellant was arrested

have been explained in evidence. What the victim did in the night after

the appellant was arrested and taken by the police is not needed to

4

establish the prosecution case. If the appellant wanted to show

anything to the court by disclosing where the boy was from midnight to

morning, the learned defence counsel could have cross-examined the

victim and disclosed the same. Hence, where the victim was from

midnight to morning has no relevance to determine this case.

The argument whether the victim had not gone to the ground with the

police to show the accused was advanced by the learned counsel for the

appellant with the omission appears on page 93 of the appeal brief. By

the said omission, it was drawn to the attention of the court that in the

statement of the PW 1, Mahesh Saman Kumara to the police, it has not

been stated that he went to the Municipal grounds with police officers.

It is very important to be noted that although the said omission was

drawn to the attention of the court, even a single suggestion has not

been made by the learned counsel for the accused-appellant to the

victim that he did not go to the Municipal grounds with police officers.

In the case of Banda and others V. Attorney General (1999) 3 Sri L.R.

168 it was held that Omissions do not stand in the same position as

contradictions and discrepancies. The rule in regard to consistency and

inconsistency is not strictly applicable to omissions. Therefore, the

omission that was drawn to the attention of the court in this case, would

remain just as an omission because the matter sought to be raised by

the omission has not even been suggested to the witness.

It is to be noted that the reason of pointing out an omission is to draw

the attention of the court to the fact that what was said in court while

giving evidence was not stated in the statement given to the police. An

omission gets a value, only if it is in line with the defence taken by the

appellant. Here, the victim has explained in his evidence how he met

police officers on the road, how he went with police officers to the

Municipal grounds and how he pointed out the appellant. When the

victim explained all those details, not a single question had been asked

5

and even a suggestion had not been made to him on behalf of the

appellant that the victim did not go with the Police officers to the ground

and point out the appellant. Without challenging the evidence in the

trial court that the victim has gone with police officers to the Municipal

grounds and identified the appellant, now the said facts could not be

challenged in the appeal. Hence, the victim going with Police officers to

the Municipal grounds to identify the appellant has to be considered as

unchallenged evidence.

In addition, PW 9, PS Amarasinghe testified that he was on petrol duty

and has met the victim in Balangoda town around 11.30 p.m. He

corroborates the victims evidence and states that the victim had

complained about the incident and they have gone to the pavilion of the

Municipal grounds around 11.40 p.m. as shown by the victim. He

explained further, how they find the accused-appellant and specifically

stated that the moment the accused came out from the room, the victim

identified him as the person who abused him sexually.

As pointed out by the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the

respondent, it is vital to be noted that when they first saw the watcher

Pushpa Kumara who was in a room of the pavilion, the victim had

stated that the watcher was not the person who abused him. Soon after

the victim saw the appellant, he identified him. So, it is apparent that

the victim had no uncertainty or difficulty in identifying the appellant.

Therefore, the identification of the accused-appellant is precise. The

learned High Court Judge has also evaluated the evidence and found

that the victim has properly identified the appellant. Therefore, the facts

of the victim being gone with Police officers to the Municipal grounds

and identifying the appellant are well corroborated. Thereafter, the

appellant was arrested and brought to the Police Station. In the said

circumstances, there is no merit in the argument that the appellant had

been falsely implicated.

6

The other matter pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant

was that the appellant was brought to the Police Station for an offence

of theft and subsequently he was implicated for the sexual abuse

incident. It is correct that when the appellant was in the Police Station,

his statement regarding some other offence was recorded at 11:00

hours on 28.12.2007. Later on, at 12:45 hours, his statement regarding

this sexual abuse was recorded. That does not mean the appellant had

been taken into police custody for an offence of theft and he was

implicated for this offence.

As stated previously, the victim had no reason to implicate the appellant

falsely because, at the time of the incident, he was an unknown person

to the victim. There is clear evidence that only after the appellant was

shown to the PW 9 by the victim, the appellant was arrested and

brought to the Police Station. Thereafter, Police officers may have

recorded some other statement relating to a complaint received earlier.

There is no strange in that. The same person may be a suspect of two

offences. Hence, I regret that I am unable to accept the argument of the

learned counsel for the appellant that the appellant was brought to the

police station for an offence of theft and subsequently he was implicated

for the offence of sexual abuse.

In this case, as the learned High Court Judge correctly observed, the

victim has given evidence that can be accepted without reasonable

doubt. Therefore, the charge could be proved on his evidence. In Regina

V. W.G. Dharmasena 58 NLR 15, it was held that in charge of rape,

it is not in law necessary that the evidence of the prosecutrix should be

corroborated. The case before us is also a sexual offence and thus the

same legal position applies in this case as well. In the cases of the King

V. Themis Singho 45 NLR 378 and Premasiri V. the Queen 77 NLR

85, it was held that in a charge of rape, it is proper for a Jury to convict

on uncorroborated evidence of the complainant only when such

7

evidence is of such a character as to convince the Jury that she is

speaking the truth.

In the instant action, the victims evidence has been corroborated by

the evidence of PW 9 as well as by the medical evidence. However, even

without corroboration, the court could act upon the victims evidence,

as it is apparent that he speaks the truth. The doctor who gave evidence

had stated that there was a 1mm laceration in the anus of the victim.

So, there is sufficient evidence to prove that the victim was sexually

abused. When the entirety of the evidence is considered together, it is

established that the offence of grave sexual abuse has been committed

by the appellant.

The victim has identified the appellant soon after the incident.

Identifying a person immediately after an incident without delay is a

strong identification. The complaint was made to the police without any

delay. In fact, soon after the incident, the victim had narrated the

incident to the police officers. So, there was no room for any other

person to fabricate a story and teach him. On the other hand, the victim

had no reason to make a false allegation to an unknown person. His

complaint was recorded the next day. The learned High Court Judge

has evaluated all the relevant evidence correctly, considered all

contradictions and omissions and extensively dealt with the relevant

facts and circumstances of the case in his well-considered 42-page

Judgment.

In these circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment

and the sentence of the learned High Court Judge. Accordingly, the

conviction and the sentence imposed on the appellant are affirmed and

the appeal is dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.
