JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted in the High Court of Panadura for committing the

following offences:

I. Under Section 296 of the Penal Code for committing the murder of

Anoma Magammana on or about 29th March 2004 at Magammana.

II. In the course of the same transaction for committing house trespass

in order to commit an offence punishable by death and thereby liable

to be punished under Section 435 of the Penal Code.

III. In the course of the same transaction robbing a gold chain worth of

Rs.80,000/- and a sum of Rs.45,000/- which items were in Anoma

Magammanas possession an offence punishable under Section 380

of the Penal Code.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Panadura as the

Appellant had opted for a non-jury trial. After the conclusion of the

prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge had called for the defence

and the Appellant had made a dock statement, called witnesses and closed

his case. After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the

learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellant for all counts and

sentenced him on 26/11/2015 as follows:

3 | P a g e

I. For Count 01, the Appellant was sentenced to death.

II. A term of 20 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.100,000/-

with a default sentence of 01 years simple imprisonment for count

No.02.

III. A term of 10 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.50,000/-

with a default sentence of 01 years simple imprisonment for count

No.03.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the

Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the

Covid 19 pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellant was

connected via Zoom from prison.

Background of the Case

PW2, Manorika, resided in the same house along with the deceased and

her father. On the day of the incident i.e., on 29/03/2004 when she

returned home from work around 7.55 p.m., she had found the main door

unlocked but the lights not switched on in the house. When she had

searched the house after switching the lights on, she had found the

deceased lying on the floor between the bed and an almirah in a room. This

room is only used by the deceaseds brother whenever he returns home

from abroad. She had also observed a blue-coloured nylon ligature around

her neck. She had further noticed that the gold chain usually worn by the

deceased was missing. She had called PW1 immediately and the police had

been informed through PW1. According to her, the deceased got legally

married to the Appellant but had undergone a divorce within three years.

4 | P a g e

As the deceased had loved the Appellant very much the Appellant had

obtained the divorce ex-parte.

Investigations commenced and it revealed that the deceased had gone to

the bank around 2.30 p.m. on the date of incident and withdrawn

Rs.80,000/- from her account by way of a loan against her fixed deposit.

During the investigation a fingerprint from the mirror frame and a palm

print from the almirah door had been recovered from the room where the

deceased was found lying on the ground.

The Appellant was arrested on 17/05/2004 and upon his statement,

Rs.40,000/- cash, a portion of nylon ligature and the gold chain of the

deceased had been recovered by the police. Upon examination the

Government Analyst had opined that the parts of the ligature removed from

the corpse could be the portion recovered upon information provided by the

Appellant.

The fingerprint traced from the scene of crime did not match with the

Appellants fingerprint but the palm print matched with that of the

Appellant.

The telephone details obtained from the Appellants telecommunication

service provider - Sri Lanka Telecom had revealed that the Appellant had

been in contact with the deceased over the phone on 13 different occasions

between 01/03/2004 and 31/03/2004.

The Appellant made a dock statement and denied the charges and called

08 witnesses. The Appellants wife who gave evidence for the defence

alleged that the Appellant was in fact, arrested on 11/05/2004 and not on

17/05/2004 as claimed by the police. Further, the recovery made based on

the Appellants statement was heavily contested by the Appellant relying on

a reporter who had been alleged to have reported about the said recovery

5 | P a g e

on 18/05/2004 in the Dinamina newspaper which was the very next day

of the arrest.

Following grounds of appeal are advanced by the Appellant.

1. The Learned Trial judge has failed to consider that the

circumstances brought forth against the Appellant by the

prosecution are not cogent and fully established and are wholly

inadequate to support the conviction.

2. The Learned Trial judge has failed to consider the failure of the

prosecution to rule out the possibility of a third party committing

the crime.

3. The Learned Trial judge has failed to consider the explanation

given by the Appellant and the inherent weaknesses in the

evidence pertaining to the palmprint.

4. The Trial Court has failed to consider the well-established

principle suspicious circumstances do not establish guilt.

5. The Learned High Court judge has misdirected himself by

applying the Lucas Principle and by drawing adverse inference

against the Appellant.

6. The Learned High Court judge has come to an erroneous finding

based on speculations and surmises.

It is a well-established principle that in a case based on circumstantial

evidence it is the duty of the trial judge to take into consideration the fact

that the evidence must be totally inconsistent with the innocence of the

accused and must only be consistent with his guilt. As this case entirely

rests on circumstantial evidence, it is necessary to discuss with case laws

how this concept has been developed and accepted in our judicial system.

6 | P a g e

In the case of C. Chenga Reddy and others v. State of Andhra Pradesh

(1996) 10 SCC 193 the court held that:

In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the settled law is

that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is

drawn should be fully proved and such circumstances must be

conclusive in nature. Moreover, all the circumstances should be

complete and there should be no gap left in the chain of

evidence. Further the proved circumstances must be consistent

only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and totally

inconsistent with his innocence.

In the case of The Attorney General v. Potta Naufer & Others [2007) 2

SLR 144 the Supreme Court held that:

When relying on circumstantial evidence to establish the charge

of conspiracy to commit murder and the charge of murder, the

proved items of circumstantial evidence when taken together

must irresistibly point towards the only inference that the

accused committed the offence.

In the case of Kusumadasa v. State [2011] 1 SLR 240 Sisira de Abrew J in

the Court of Appeal held that:

The prosecution must prove that no one else other than the

accused had the opportunity of committing the offence. The

accused can be found guilty only and only if the proved items of

circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt and

inconsistent with their innocence.

7 | P a g e

In Premawansha v. Attorney General [2009] 2 SLR 205 the Court of

Appeal held that:

In a case of circumstantial evidence if an inference of guilt is to

be drawn, such an inference must be the one and only

irresistible and inescapable conclusion that the accused

committed the offence.

In the case of Regina v. Exall and Others [1866] 4F. & F. pages 922 at

929 the Court held that:

It has been said that circumstantial evidence is to be

considered as a chain, and each piece of evidence as a link in

the chain, but that is not so, for then, if any one link broke, the

chain would fall. It is more like the case of a rope composed of

several cords. One strand of the cord might be insufficient to

sustain the weight, but three stranded together may be quite of

sufficient strength.

Thus it may be in circumstantial evidencethere may be a

combination of circumstances, no one of which would raise a

reasonable conviction, or more than a mere suspicion; but the

whole, taken together, may create a strong conclusion of guilt,

that is, with as much certainty as human affairs can require or

admit of.

In this case in order to find the Appellant guilty to the charge, all the

circumstances must point at the Appellant that he is the one who

committed the murder of the deceased and not anybody else. It is the

incumbent duty of the prosecution to prove same beyond reasonable doubt.

8 | P a g e

In the first ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the Learned Trial

judge has failed to consider that the circumstances brought forth against

the Appellant by the prosecution are not cogent and fully established and

are wholly inadequate to support the conviction.

According to the prosecution, the deceased was found dead on

29/03/2007. The investigation commenced on that day itself. According to

PW2 the deceased had legally registered his matrimony with the Appellant

in the year 1997 but no marriage ceremony had been held. At that time the

Appellant was working in the Sri Lankan Army and was serving in the

North. As the Appellant had not shown any interest to marry the deceased

ceremonially, the said marriage ended up in a divorce filed ex-parte by the

Appellant. Even though the marriage had ended the deceased had been in

love with the Appellant. The Appellant had visited the deceaseds house

several times before the divorce, but not afterwards. After the funeral when

this witness was examining the personal items of the deceased, she had

found her bank passbook and a slip which indicated the withdrawal of

money on the date of the incident. As this witness had come across their

landline being engaged continuously on several occasions, she had passed

this information to the police for investigation purposes.

The police continued their investigation after receiving this information

from PW2 and arrested the Appellant on 17/05/2004 at his Padukka

residence. Upon the information provided by the Appellant the police had

recovered a jam bottle from the ceiling of the Appellants house and a

portion of blue coloured nylon rope from the rear side of his house. The

deceaseds gold chain and Rs.40,000/- cash was inside the bottle. In

addition, a Rs.5000/- note was also recovered by the police. The gold

chain had been identified by PW2 as the deceaseds chain.

9 | P a g e

The portion of the nylon rope which had been recovered upon the

information of the Appellant and the nylon rope which had been found

wrapped around the deceaseds neck had been sent to Government

Analyst. The piece of rope that was found wrapped around the deceaseds

neck had been cut in to 07 pieces by the Judicial Medical Officer when he

removed it from the deceaseds neck. According to the Government

Analysts Report all pieces originate from one and the same nylon rope.

According to the JMO, the death had been caused due to Asphyxia

following ligature strangulation.

The admissibility of the recovery evidence under Section 27(1) of the

Evidence Ordinance had been discussed in several cases decided by the

Superior Courts of our country.

The Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance states that,

When any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of

information received from a person accused of any offence, in the

custody of a police officer, so much of such information, whether it

amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact

thereby discovered may be proved.

The Supreme Court in the case of Somaratne Rajapakse Others v. Hon.

Attorney General (2010) 2 Sri L.R. 113 at 115 stated that:

A vital limitation on the scope of Section 27 of the Evidence

Ordinance is that only the facts which are distinctly related to

what has been discovered would be permitted in evidence.

'There should be a clear nexus between the information given by

the accused and the subsequent discovery of a relevant fact. A

discovery made in terms of Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance

10 | P a g e

discloses that the information given was true and that the

Accused had knowledge of the existence and the whereabouts of

the actual discovery.

In this case the Learned High Court judge had very correctly admitted the

recovery under Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

In the evidence of PW2 it was revealed that the deceased was in contact

with the Appellant even after the divorce. Hence the police investigated this

information by obtaining telephone call details of the two sides landlines to

check the veracity of the information given by PW2 on this point.

The investigation had revealed that the telephone no. 011 2753190 is

registered under the name of M. Edwin, who is the father of the deceased

and of PW2. Telephone No. 011 2830235 is registered under the name of

the Appellant. Telephone details obtained for the period between

01.03.2004 to 31.03.2004 revealed that 13 calls had originated from the

deceaseds house to the Appellants house in the month of March, 2004.

The dates of which are as follows:

01.03.2004, 02.03.2004, 03.03.2004, 05.03.2004, 11.03.2004,

12.03.2004, 13.03.2004, 15.03.2004, 16.03.2004, 17.03.2004,

18.03.2004, 19.03.2004, 20.03.2004, 22.03.2004, 23.03.2004, 26.03.2004

and 27.03.2004.

The last call originating from the deceaseds house was on 27.03.2004.

Hence it is quite clear that the deceased was in constant contact with the

Appellant. This position was admitted by the Appellant in his dock

statement.

11 | P a g e

It was contended that the Appellant was arrested on 11/05/2004 at his

residence and not on 17/05/2004 as claimed by the prosecution.

According to PW8, the Appellant was arrested on 17/05/2004 at 10.00

p.m. at his residence. His statement was recorded at 1.15 a.m. on

18/05/2004. To recover the production the police had visited the

Appellants house at 6.30 a.m. on 18/05/2004. The witness vehemently

denied that the Appellant was arrested on 11/05/2004. To contradict the

date of arrest the Appellant marked the case record of the Bail Application

and highlighted that PW8 in his objection has mentioned the date of arrest

as 18/05/2004. This cannot be considered as a vital contradiction which

affects the root of the case as the Appellant was arrested on 17/05/2004 at

10.00 p.m. by the police.

Further, although the wife of the Appellant said in her evidence that the

Appellant was arrested on 11/05/2004, she only lodged her complaint at

the Police Headquarters on 17/05/2004 at 11.35 a.m. Even though a

complaint was lodged, she was neither summoned for any inquiry nor was

her statement obtained until she gave evidence before the High Court.

The Counsel for the Appellant further argued that even before the recovery

was made under Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance by PW8, the said

news had been published in the Dinamina Newspaper published on

18/05/2004. Without going into detail, I fully agree with the reasons given

by the Learned High Court judge as to why he had refused to act on the

evidence given by the defence witness Deepal Rathnayake. The reasoning

given by the Learned High Court judge is reproduced verbatim as follows:

tu mqj;am;a inkaOj fmd;am;a lsisjla bosrsm;a fkdue;'

Due to aforesaid reasons, I find that the first ground of appeal has no

merit.

In the second ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the Learned

Trial judge has failed to consider the failure of the prosecution to rule out

the possibility of a third party committing the crime.

The defence had queried from PW8 whether he investigated about the

three-wheel driver Nimal Dharmasiri alias Sudu Malli who was supposed to

have stated that a person who was travelling in his three-wheeler had

asked him whether a lady had been murdered on 29/03/2004. The

investigating officer had conducted the investigation and recorded his

statement but could not establish any breakthrough based on it.

The defence had called the three-wheeler driver Nimal Dharmasiri as a

witness. According to him a person who went on a hire in his three-wheeler

had asked him whether a murder had taken place in the area. As he was

unaware, he had replied in the negative. During cross examination the

witness had stated that he was not certain whether the village people were

aware of the incident by that time. According to him the time was around

7.30 p.m. when he went on the hire. This witness is an ordinary person of

the society who never expected that he would be called in to give evidence

before a court of law. He had referred to an approximate time period

without verifying it with an actual clock. Hence considering the evidence of

this witness it is incorrect to argue that his evidence casts a doubt about a

third party committing the crime.

13 | P a g e

The Learned High Court judge has considered this evidence in his

judgment. As this evidence failed to create any doubt on the prosecution

case, I conclude that the second ground of appeal is also sans merit.

The Appellant in his third ground of appeal contends that the Learned Trial

Judge has failed to consider the explanation given by the Appellant and the

inherent weaknesses in the evidence pertaining to the palm print.

The Counsel for the Appellant argued that the fingerprint and the palm

print uplifted from the crime scene were not proved beyond reasonable

doubt by the prosecution.

PW8, IP Navaratne had visited the crime scene upon receiving the

complaint from PW1. He had gone to the room where the deceaseds body

was found and has recorded his observations and has engaged police

protection for the crime scene until the arrival of the officers to collect

finger print evidence. On 30/03/2004 two police officers namely SI

Kaluarachchi and PC 17600 Sisira from the Police Fingerprint Department

had arrived at the crime scene and had extracted a fingerprint from a

dressing table and a palm print from an almirah. Although the fingerprint

and the palm print were extracted on 30/03/2004, the Appellant was

arrested on 17/05/2004 about one and a half months following the

incident. Further, when the fingerprint and palm print were extracted,

there was no any clue received regarding any suspect in connection to this

incident. The Appellant was arrested upon further inquiry conducted on

phone conversation details.

According to PW9, the Registrar of the Fingerprint Department confirmed

that SI Kaluarachchi had extracted a fingerprint and a palm print on

30/05/2004. As he only received the fingerprint of the Appellant on

18/05/2004, he had done the comparison but the fingerprint extracted

14 | P a g e

from the dressing table was not matched with the Appellants fingerprint.

As the palm print of the Appellant had not been sent for comparison, he

had called for the same from Kahathuduwa Police. On 09/11/2004, he had

received the palm print of the Appellant for comparison. Upon comparison,

the Appellants palm print was found to coincide with the palm print

extracted from the almirah on 30/05/2004. Accordingly, he had prepared

the report and submitted it to court. He has placed evidence before the

court of his expertise in the particular field and had given evidence after

marking all necessary photographs and documents to substantiate his

opinion.

The evidence regarding the extraction of the fingerprint and palm print

were not contradicted during the trial. Further the Appellant was arrested

after about one and half months of the detection of the fingerprint and the

palm print.

The Appellant in his dock statement contended that he had visited the

deceaseds house and stayed in her room on several occasions prior to legal

marriage. But he failed to mention whether he used the furniture and other

items in the room. But according to PW1 and PW2 the room where the body

of the deceased was found is exclusively used by deceaseds brother

whenever he comes home from abroad and not by the deceased. Further,

according to PW2 the marriage of the deceased was terminated in the year

2000, four years prior to the murder.

The investigating officer admitted that the Appellant was taken to the

deceaseds house after his arrest on 17/05/2004. But the palm print was

extracted on 30/05/2004. As such there is no room for the fabrication of

evidence against the Appellant in this case.

15 | P a g e

Section 45 of the Evidence Ordinance states:

When the court has to form an opinion as to foreign law, or of

science, or art, or as to identity or genuineness of handwriting or

finger impressions, palm impressions or foot impressions, the

opinions upon that point of persons specially skilled in such foreign

law, science, or art, or in questions as to identity or genuineness of

handwriting or finger impressions, palm impressions or foot

impressions, are relevant facts. Such persons are called experts.

In The Queen v. Wijehamy 62 NLR 425 the Court of Appeal held that:

Under Section 45 of the Evidence Ordinance it is for the court to

form an opinion as to the identity of finger and palm

impressions, assisted by the opinion of an expert.

In the King v. Jayasena [1933] 2 CLW the court held that:

A conviction can be based on finger print evidence alone, in the

absence of a satisfactory explanation from the accused.

Considering the evidence presented pertaining to the palm print impression

of the Appellant, the explanation given by the Appellant and being guided

by the above-mentioned judgments, the acceptance of palm print evidence

has not caused any prejudice in this case. As such this ground is also

devoid of any merit.

In the fourth ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the Trial Court

has failed to consider the well-established principle suspicious

circumstances do not establish guilt.

16 | P a g e

In the case of The Queen v. M. G. Sumanasena 66 NLR 350 it was held

that:

In a criminal case suspicious circumstances do not establish

guilt. Nor does the proof of any number of suspicious

circumstances relieve the prosecution of its burden of proving the

case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt and compel

the accused to give or call evidence.

In this case the Learned High Court judge has considered all the evidence

presented by the prosecution and the defence accurately. The evidence

presented by both parties had been analyzed extensively and reasons had

been given for the acceptance and rejection of evidence.

In the fifth ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the Learned High

Court judge has misdirected himself by applying the Lucas Principle and

by drawing adverse inference against the Appellant.

In R v. Lucas [1981] 1 Q.B. 720 the following criteria were laid down for

situations necessitating the courts to consider whether lies, whether told in

court or out of court, can amount to corroboration:

To be capable of amounting to corroboration the lie told out of

court must first of all be deliberate. Secondly it must relate to a

material issue. Thirdly the motive for the lie must be a

realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. The jury should in

appropriate cases be reminded that people sometimes lie, for

example, in an attempt to bolster up a just cause, or out of

shame or out of a wish to conceal disgraceful behaviour from

their family. Fourthly the statement must be clearly shown to be

17 | P a g e

a lie by evidence other than that of the accomplice who is to be

corroborated, that is to say by admission or by evidence from an

independent witness.

Hence false denial can amount to corroboration in appropriate

circumstances, only when it relates to a vital issue which is in dispute in

the case.

In Ajith Samarakoon v The Republic (Kobaigane Murder Case) [2004] 2

SLR 209 applying the Lucas Principle Jayasuriya, J. held that:

The accused made a dock statement in the course of which he

denied the charge and he emphatically stated that he had held

a high and exalted position of Officer-in-Charge of the Kobeigana

police station and there was no necessity whatsoever for him to

maintain and have a love affair with a daughter of Dingiriya

who as. a mere coconut plucker by profession and who resided

in the same village. He also stated that there was no necessity

whatsoever for him to obtain Gunaratnehamy's van when there

were several jeeps and a requisitioned van at the Kobeigana

police station for his use.

His Lordship further held that:

The accused had uttered a deliberate lie on a material issue -

love letters written by the deceased to the accused-because he

knew that if he told the truth he could be sealing his fate, if such

was the motive the utterance of such lie would corroborate the

prosecution case.

18 | P a g e

The principle is that a lie on some material issue by a party may

indicate consciousness that if he tells the truth he will lose.

In this case the Appellant using his statutory right to make a dock

statement, denying the charges level against him, took up several positions

which he has not confronted in cross examination with the relevant

witnesses. Although he had stated in his dock statement that the police

officers who had conducted the investigation had solicited Rs.100,000/-

bribe for his release, but this position was not put to the relevant witnesses

in the cross examination.

Further, although he had taken the position that he had had the access to

the deceaseds house when he registered the marriage with the deceased

but failed to explain whether he had used the said almirah on which his

palm print was uplifted.

Although he had taken up the position that the fingerprint which had been

uplifted from the dressing table had gone missing but the evidence given by

the relevant witness for the prosecution stated that the fingerprint did not

match with the Appellants fingerprint.

In this case as the Appellant had not lie on some material issue, the

applying of Lucas Principle, I consider it is not appropriate in this case. But

applying this principle has not caused any adverse inference on the

Appellant as the Learned High Court Judge has very correctly considered

the all-available circumstances adduced in this case.

19 | P a g e

In the final ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the Learned High

Court judge has come to an erroneous finding based on speculations and

surmises.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment very extensively considered

the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defence to come to his

conclusion. He had not acted on speculations and surmises. Also, not

considered the evidence presented by both sides erroneously. Hence this

ground also devoid any merit.

The Learned High Court Judge has considered this case in keeping with

standards that should have been adopted when a case is rest entirely on

circumstantial evidence. His consideration very clearly in keeping with the

guidance that have been decided in several judgments which were entirely

rested on circumstances evidence. He has analyzed the evidence and given

reasons why he accepts the prosecution case.

Further he had considered the dock statement of the Appellant and had

given plausible reasons as to why he rejects the same. Also had given equal

and due consideration to the defence evidence in his judgement.

As discussed under the appeal grounds advanced by the Appellant, the

prosecution had adduced strong and incriminating circumstantial evidence

against the Appellant. The Learned High Court Judge had very correctly

analyzed all the evidence presented by both parties and come to conclusion

that the all the circumstances are consistent only with the hypothesis of

the guilt of the Appellant and totally inconsistent with his innocence.

20 | P a g e

As the Learned High Court Judge had rightly convicted the Appellant for all

the charges levelled against him in the indictment, I affirm the conviction

and dismiss the Appeal of the Appellant.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court

of Panadura along with the original case record.
