This is a revision application against the order dated 05.04.2022, delivered

by the Provincial High Court of the Southern Province holden in Tangalle

which refused to act in revision and affirmed the vehicle confiscation order

dated 01.02.2022, delivered by the Walasmulla Magistrate Court under

the provisions of Forest Ordinance. The petitioner has invoked the

revisionary jurisdiction of this Court in order to have both the orders set

aside, and thereby disallow the confiscation of the vehicle bearing

registration no. SP-LB 7260 (hereinafter the vehicle).

The following are the facts of the case. The accused was charged in the

Magistrate Court of Walasmulla for the offence of transporting timber

worth Rs. 38314.55 without a permit in the said vehicle, thereby

contravening Sections 40, 40(a), and 40(b) read with Section 25(2) (a) of

the Forest Ordinance as amended by laws, inter alia, Act no.65 of 2009

(hereinafter the Act). The accused pleaded guilty to the charge and the

Magistrate convicted the accused on 04.09.2018, upon which the accused

was imposed a fine of Rs. 20,000/- with a default imprisonment sentence.

The conviction of the accused ensued the confiscation of the vehicle in

relation to the offence which was released temporarily to its registered

owner, the claimant- petitioner (hereinafter the petitioner), on the same

day on a bond, and the learned Magistrate fixed the vehicle inquiry on

12.02.2019. After an inquiry into the matters of the petitioners knowledge

of the said diversion of the vehicle in relation to the case and whether the

petitioner has taken sufficient precautionary measures to prevent such an

offence, the Magistrate set out the order dated 01.02.2022 to confiscate

the vehicle. Aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner filed for revision in

CA-CPA-0049-22 Page 5 of 10 01/12/2022 IJ-55-22

the High Court of Tangalle, and the revision application was rejected by

the High Court in limine.

Hence, the petitioner has preferred the instant revision application to the

Court of Appeal, seeking to set aside the impugned order dated 05.04.2022

of the High Court of Tangalle.

Primarily, it is pertinent to set out the pivotal issue before this Court which

is the determination of whether the learned High Court Judge, having

dismissed the application of the petitioner at the supporting stage, has

erred in law, thereby sufficing to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this

Court.

In this regard, the primary contention before this Court is to determine

whether the impugned order has erred in concluding that the petitioner

has failed to satisfy the court to the extent of issuing formal notice on the

respondents. In other terms, it is incumbent upon this Court to examine

whether the High Court has sufficiently assessed the establishment of a

prima facie case (the legal threshold by which formal notice is issued on

the respondents) before dismissing the petitioners application in limine.

At page 6 of the impugned order, the learned High Court Judge makes the

following pronouncement:

When examining the above, it is evident that the learned High Court judge

is directly referring to the confiscation order of the Magistrates Court of

Walasmulla delivered on 01.02.2022 and deeming that no exceptionality

is present in the same in favour of the petitioner. Nowhere in the impugned

order has the learned High Court Judge referred to the exceptional

CA-CPA-0049-22 Page 6 of 10 01/12/2022 IJ-55-22

circumstances averred by the petitioner in his revisionary application

RA/07/2022. In his petition the petitioner has averred, inter alia, the

following as exceptional circumstances:

1. The learned Magistrate has failed to properly evaluate the

adduced evidence and thus has erred in rejecting the petitioners

position that he has taken necessary precautions.

2. The learned Magistrate has not properly evaluated the

contradictions in the evidence of the petitioner and the driver.

3. The learned Magistrate has not considered the vital elements of

the applicable law and the decided case law, a court should take

into consideration when confiscating the said vehicle.

(Vide Paragraph 7 of the petition marked as P4)

Yet, the impugned order does not refer to such averments or otherwise

assess whether the same establishes a prima facie case of exceptionality

that would warrant the issuance of formal notice on the respondents. It

appears that the learned High Court judge has prematurely examined the

impugned order and deemed it need not be interfered with. Even to that

end, the learned High Court Judge has failed to give any reasons. At no

point in the impugned order has the learned judge refer to the submissions

of the petitioner, either written or oral, where the petitioner purports an

exceptionality. Instead, the learned High Court Judge has directly

proceeded to assess the impugned order. While the impugned order refers

to the discretionary nature of a revisionary application, such discretion

must be utilized, at least in the Support Stage of an application, to assess

the threshold of a prima facie case. This is the standard used evinced by

case law.

CA-CPA-0049-22 Page 7 of 10 01/12/2022 IJ-55-22

This Court in Horathal Pedige Prishriya Ratna Vilochani v Hon.

Attorney General CA/PHC/90/18 CA Minute dated 25.07.2022, held

that:

At the support stage, the Court is required to make an assessment

as to whether the resources of the Court ought to be exhausted by

proceeding to the next stage by issuing notice to the respondents. That

determination is at the discretion of the judge and is made by

ascertaining whether the purported exceptional circumstances require

further examination or not. If the Court determines that such an

examination is not warranted, it can dismiss the application in limine,

thus preserving the Courts resources for a more deserving

application. This entire process is an act of judicial discretion, which

falls in line with the revisionary jurisdiction of both the Court of Appeal

and the Provincial High Courts as a petitioner cannot invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Court as of right. A blanket ban from

even referring to the exceptional circumstances at the support stage,

on the other hand, would amount to ousting the said discretion vested

with the Court acting in revision. The Courts can refer to the

exceptional circumstances averred during the support stages to the

extent of examining whether a prima facie case has been made

out in the application so as to warrant the issuance of notice on the

respondents.

In the same case, this Court analyzed the judgments in Sarath

Andarahennadi v Officer in Charge, Police Station Sigiriya

CA/PHC/APN/117/2017 CA Minute dated 27.03.2019 and Ingiriya

Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Ltd v Kalubalage Dona Laitha

Srimathi CA/PHC/123/16 CA Minute dated 17.05.2022 to conclude that

CA-CPA-0049-22 Page 8 of 10 01/12/2022 IJ-55-22

...In both instances, the Court of Appeal affirmed the thinking that if an

application purports exceptional circumstances, despite them having the

likelihood of failing to amount to an exceptionality in the eyes of the Court

when merits are considered at a later stage, such likelihood alone will not

make an application liable to be dismissed in limine. Speaking on the

burden cast on an applicant at the support stage, His Lordship Justice

Arjuna Obeysekara recently held the following in P. M. Ranasinghe v

Asselage Sujith Rupasinghe and Others SC Appeal No. 59/2021 SC

Minute dated 08.04.2022: In order to have notice issued on the

Respondents, the burden cast on the Appellant was to establish a prima

facie sustainable case and for the Court to be satisfied that there is a prima

facie case to be looked into. In other words, the Court was only required to

be satisfied that the application before it warrants a full investigation at a

hearing with the participation of all parties.

Hence, it is clear that the law on issuance of formal notice on the

respondent during the support stage in revisionary application, places a

burden on the petitioner to satisfy the court that there exists a prima facie

case against the order being impugned. And as such, it is the duty of the

presiding judge, to use his discretion judiciously to assess whether such

a threshold has been met. Therefore, at the support stage, the presiding

judge must assess averred the exceptionality within the test of prima facie

case. And in doing so, such examination cannot be arbitrary for a judge

must give reasons as to why he concluded the existence of a prima facie

case or the lack thereof.

However, the impugned order of the present case reveals no such judicious

assessment in testing whether the petitioner has dispensed his burden. In

the instant case the petitioner has averred certain exceptional

circumstances, yet that mere averment alone would not entitle the

issuance of formal notice on a respondent. The order to issue formal notice

CA-CPA-0049-22 Page 9 of 10 01/12/2022 IJ-55-22

will require a judicious evaluation of the case presented during the support

stage in terms of assessing whether it established a prima facie case. Such

an assessment has not been carried out by the learned High Court judge.

Hence it is the considered view of this Court that the impugned order has

erroneously dismissed the application of the petitioner by failing to

examine whether the purported exceptionalities establish a prima facie

case.

Moreover, the above position of this court is further buttressed by Rule 3

(4) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules, 1990 where it is

stipulated that where upon such application is being supported and court

satisfied, the court shall order the issue of notice as long as the petitioner

has, without fail tendered the necessary documents as required by the

rules of the court.

Furthermore, the petitioner has sought a stay order until the final

determination of the revision application, which the learned High Court

Judge has rejected on the grounds that such a stay order can only be

issued if and when notice has been served on the respondent. This is not

the correct contention of law applicable in all such applications. The

learned High Court judge has failed to take into consideration the proviso

to Rule 2 (1) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules, where it

is stipulated instances that a stay order can be granted even in the absence

of a notice to the respondents. Therefore, the learned High Court Judges

failure to give due consideration to the proviso of Rule 2 (1) amounts to an

erroneous application of the law. Hence, it is the observation of this Court

that there exists an irregularity and an illegality of the order dated

05.04.2022 delivered by the High Court of Tangalle.

Therefore, in line with the above observations, it is considered the view of

this Court that the impugned order has erred in failing to assess whether

CA-CPA-0049-22 Page 10 of 10 01/12/2022 IJ-55-22

a prima facie case has been established by the petitioner and in applying

the law as stipulated in Rule 2(1) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules. Thus, this Court affirms that there exists an irregularity

and an illegality in the impugned order. Hence, this Court sets aside the

order dated 05.04.2022 and sends back the case to the High Court of

Tangalle to hear and determine the revision application RA-07/2022.

Application allowed.
