It is pertinent to be noted that the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the said decision marked P16 after 38 years and disputing the deed of transfer marked P4 after 21 years from the date of execution. Moreover, the learned High Court Judge has rightly observed the fact that the Petitioner had become the owner of his land five years before filing the Application in the High Court. If there was an immense threat, he need not wait for such a long period to come before Court. Thus, it is an undisputed fact that there is a long delay on the part of the Petitioner in invoking the Writ jurisdiction of the High Court. In this regard, I refer to the observation made by the Supreme Court in the case of D.D. Kaluarachchi Vs. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (SC. Appeal No. 43/2013, SC Minute dated 19-06-2019). This is the case where five years after the retirement, four former employees of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation filed an Application for Writs before the Court of Appeal and moved Court for Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus in respect of certain salary arrears. The Court of Appeal issued a Writ of Mandamus directing the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation to pay the Petitioners certain salary arrears.
