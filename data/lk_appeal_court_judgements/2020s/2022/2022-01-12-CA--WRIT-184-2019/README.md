S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

This writ application has been filed on 03.05.2019 when the Petitioner was serving as

a school teacher attached to the Sri Lanka Teachers Service and while pending the

action, upon reaching the compulsory retirement age of 60 years, he had retired from

the service on 05.05.2019. He had applied for a voluntary retirement with effect from

05.05.2017 upon reaching 58 years when he was serving in a school governed under

the Central Province Provincial Council. The Zonal Director of Education of Nuwara-

eliya (the 2nd Respondent), by latter dated 03.02.2017 (with a copy to the Petitioner)

marked as P-6 forwarded the application of the Petitioner to the Zonal Director of

Education of Kothmale (the 3rd Respondent) for the approval of leave prior to

retirement and the 3rd Respondent, with a copy to the Principal of the school where

the Petitioner worked at that time, by letter dated 15.02.2017 marked as P-7 informed

the 2nd Respondent that leave prior to retirement has been approved for the period of

06.03.2017 to 04.05.2017. Thereafter, the Petitioner was informed by 2nd Respondent

by letter dated 14.03.2017 marked as P-8 that leave prior to retirement has been

approved for the period of 06.03.2017 to 04.05.2017 and by an undated letter marked

as P-10 that the steps have been initiated to retire him from the service with effect

from 05.05.2017. Consequently, the Petitioner did not report for work from

05.05.2017. Nevertheless, the Provincial Director of Education of the Central

Province (the 1st Respondent) or the 2nd or 3rd Respondents or the Secretary to the

Ministry of Education of the Central Province Provincial Council (the 4th Respondent)

who had the authority to make a decision about granting permission for the Petitioner

to retire, neither granted permission to retire nor rejected the application of the

Petitioner. The Petitioner alleges that since there was no response from the

Respondents and he had to face severe financial difficulties in maintaining his family

4

without a salary or pension, by letter dated 12.12.2017 marked as P-14 he made a

request from the 4th Respondent to reinstate him in the service with back-wages

without a break of the service. The 1st Respondent, by letter dated 29.08.2018 marked

as P-18 informed the Petitioner that the 4th Respondent had approved his request to

reinstate subject to the conditions that the period between 06.03.2017 (the date on

which leave prior to retirement was commenced) to the date of reporting back to work

as a no-pay period and to recover a sum of Rs. 137 694/40 from him, which the

Provincial Director of Audit (the 6th Respondent) had recommended to recover from

the Petitioner as a tax which he is liable to pay to the State for a vegetable cultivation

done by him on the school land without obtaining permission from the authorities.

The Petitioner reported back to work on 06.09.2018.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner argue that if the said period considered as a no-

pay period, the Petitioner would be denied back-wages for that period and it would be

prejudicial to his other emoluments including salary increments for that period and

ultimately it would reduce the monthly pension which he was entitled to upon

reaching 60 years. Therefore, the learned Counsel argued that the decision mentioned

in P-18 is illegal, arbitrary, unreasonable and irrational on the grounds that the

Petitioner did not report for work from 05.05.2017 after duly informing and obtaining

leave prior to retirement, had he duly retired on 05.05.2017 he would have been

entitled to a monthly pension from that date onwards, there is no reasonable

justification in denying back-wages and other emoluments for the period hereinbefore

mentioned, there is no fault on the part of the Petitioner for the Respondents to

consider the said period as a no-pay period and it is a violation of his legitimate

expectation.

The learned State Counsel appearing for the Respondents submitted to Court that

knowing the fact that there is a pending audit query against the Petitioner regarding

his illegal cultivation of vegetable on the school land he applied for a voluntary

retirement and because of the pending audit query his request was not allowed. The

learned State Counsel further submitted that before the audit query was concluded the

Petitioner requested to reinstate him in the service and accordingly, he was reinstated

subject to the conditions stated in P-18 and he did not object to those conditions when

he was reinstated. There is no dispute between the parties that the amount which the

Petitioner was held to be liable to pay to the State at the audit query was subsequently

deducted from his commuted pension at the time of his compulsory retirement. The

contention of the learned State Counsel appearing for the Respondents is that since

the Petitioner was not in the active service from 05.05.2017 to 06.09.2018 he is not

entitled to back-wages for that period and the decision taken by the Respondents and

communicated on P-18 is according to law. Therefore, the learned State Counsel

seeks to dismiss the Petitioners application for writs.

By this writ application, the Petitioner seeks reliefs inter alia, to issue a writ of

Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st and/or 4th Respondent contained in P-18 to

consider the period from 06.03.2017 to the date of reinstatement as a no-pay period, a

writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to 4th Respondents and the Governor of the Central

Province (the 5th Respondent) or anyone or more of them to pay the Petitioner back-

wages and other emoluments including salary increments for the period of 06.03.2017

to the date of reinstatement on 06.09.2018, alternative to that relief a writ of

Mandamus directing the 1st to 5th Respondents or anyone or more of them to pay the

Petitioner back-wages and other emoluments including salary increments for the

period from 05.05.2017 to 06.09.2018 (the date of reinstatement).

The contention of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the Petitioner had a

legitimate expectation that permission will be granted for him to retire from the date

on which leave prior to retirement was expired. The learned State Counsel for the

Respondents submitted to Court that even though, leave prior to retirement had been

approved for the Petitioner, by then the steps were initiated against him to hold an

Audit query regarding the cultivation done by him without permission of the

authorities on the school land and therefore, his application for voluntary retirement

was not approved/allowed. The learned State Counsel further submitted that since the

Petitioner did not report for work from 06.03.2017 (the date on which leave prior to

retirement commenced) to 06.09.2018 (the date of reinstatement) the 3rd Respondent

decided that the Petitioner should not be entitled to his salary for that period.

P-7 issued by the 1st Respondent states that leave prior to retirement for the Petitioner

has been approved according to the provisions of section 11 of Chapter XII of the

Establishment Code. Sub-section 11:1 of Chapter XII provides that, immediately

before retirement, an officer eligible for vacation leave, may be granted the vacation

leave available to him at the time of his retirement. Hence, according to that

provision of the Establishment Code at the time of the retirement, available

vacation leave of an officer could be granted immediately before the retirement.

Accordingly, it is clear that at the end of the vacation leave, retirement should

automatically follow and therefore, the Petitioner in the instant action should be

retired after leave prior to retirement was expired. When leave prior to retirement is

granted, substantive expectation protected procedurally is also that the retirement

should follow. Hence, an officer who is on vacation leave, expecting to retire has a

legitimate expectation that he will be allowed to retire immediately after the vacation

leave expires. Under the above stated circumstances, I hold that a legitimate

7

expectation has been arisen for the Petitioner that he will be allowed to retire with

effect from 05.05.2017.

It is a recognized principle in the administrative law that when an expectation of a

person is going to be affected, he should be given an opportunity to make

representations before his expectation is dashed. In the instant action, even though,

the Petitioner had a legitimate expectation that his application to retire with effect

from 05.05.2017 will be approved, before dashing his expectation he has not been

given an opportunity to be heard. Therefore, the failure of the Respondents to offer an

opportunity to the Petitioner to present his facts before taking the decision mentioned

in P-18 is against the principles of Natural Justice namely, audi alteram partem rule.

The learned State Counsel submitted to Court that even though, the Petitioner has

sought a writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to 5th Respondents to pay him back-

wages and other emoluments including salary increments for the period starting from

06.03.2017, his salary had been paid for the period of 06.03.2017 to 04.05.2017 as per

R-10. The learned State Counsel argues that non-disclosure of the fact that he

received his salary for that period is a suppression and misrepresentation of a material

fact and therefore, the Petitioner is not entitled to a writ of Mandamus directing to pay

his salary starting from 06.03.2017 to the date of reinstatement which includes a

period which his salary had been paid. It has been admitted by the Petitioner that his

salary has been paid for the period of 06.03.2017 to 04.05.2017. Even though, by

prayer (d) the Petitioner has sought a writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to 5th

Respondents to pay his salary for the period commencing from 06.03.2017, by prayer

(e) alternatively he has prayed for his salary for the period commencing from

8

05.05.2017, excluding the period which he has been already paid. Therefore, the

Court will consider granting the alternative relief sought by prayer (e).

The learned State Counsel argues that the Petitioner has suppressed the fact that he

had cultivated vegetable on 60 perches of the school land and attempted to impress

the Court that he had used only a small portion of the land for his vegetable

cultivation. Therefore, the learned State Counsel argues that the Petitioner has not

come to Court with clean hands and on that reason, he should not be entitled to

prerogative reliefs by way of writs. There is no Surveyor plan for the satisfaction of

the Court that the extent of the land utilized for the private use of the Petitioner is

exactly 60 perches. Nevertheless, especially in paragraphs 8 to 10, 12, 13, 22, 23, 28,

29, 34, 39, 42 and 43 the Petitioner has disclosed the facts about the cultivation done

by him on the school land, Audit query held against him regarding to that cultivation,

the outcome of the inquiry. Therefore, even though, the Petitioner has not stated the

exact extent of the land he utilized for his private purpose, the Court can be satisfied

that he has not suppressed the fact that he has done a vegetable cultivation on the

school land without permission of the authorities and the consequences he had faced

thereafter. It has been admitted that the amount which the Petitioner was held to be

liable to pay as tax to the State for his vegetable cultivation was deducted from his

commuted pension. In any event the Petitioner does not seek any relief regarding the

tax he had paid to the State. Therefore, the extent of the land which the Petitioner has

cultivated the vegetable is not a material and an important fact to consider in issuing

the writs sought by the Petitioner and the above stated argument of the learned State

Counsel is devoid of merits.

Another argument of the learned State Counsel is that the Petitioner has failed to

explain the delay in seeking reliefs from the Court. The Petitioner has filed this writ

9

application on 03.05.2019 impugning the decision of the Respondents dated

29.08.2018. Therefore, it seems that there is a gap of about eight months between

those two dates. The Petitioner has requested/appealed to set aside the decision

contained in P-18 to consider the period from 06.03.2017 to the date of reinstatement

as a no-pay period and to pay his salary for the period which he had not been paid

from the 4th Respondent by the appeal dated 25.09.2018 marked P-20, from the State

Minister of Education by letter dated 03.10.2018 marked P-21, from the Secretary to

the Ministry of Education of the Central Government by letter dated 31.10.2018

marked P-25, from the 5th Respondent by the appeals dated 12.12.2017 and

19.12.2018 marked as P-30 and P-31 respectively, from the 3rd Respondent by the

latter dated 20.12.2018 marked P-32(a), from the 1st Respondent by letter dated

26.12.2018 marked P-32(b), from the 5th Respondent by letter dated 16.01.2019

marked as P-32(c) and from the Accountant of the Provincial Education office by

letter dated 31.01.2019 marked P-32(d). Nevertheless, the Petitioner has not received

any official response to the said letters/appeals from them up till 31.01.2019. Since his

grievance has not been addressed, this action has been instituted on 03.05.2019 after

about 3 months from that date of P-32(d). Under such circumstances, the Court can be

satisfied that the Petitioner has sought reliefs from the Court within a reasonable

period of time and therefore, he is not guilty of laches.

According to the learned State Counsel appearing for the Respondents, reason for not

granting permission to the Petitioner to retire after the vacation leave was expired was

that there was a pending inquiry against him regarding the illegal vegetable

cultivation on the school land. If that is so, he should not have been granted leave

prior to retirement and should have been informed immediately in writing that his

application for retirement could not be considered. But the Respondents have failed to

10

take such steps. Had the Respondents took such a step, there was no other option for

the Petitioner other than reporting for work at the end of the vacation leave. On the

other hand, if there was any impediment to grant permission for the Petitioner to

retire, when he did not report for work after the vacation leave was expired, the proper

step should have been the service of vacation of post notice or to take steps to dismiss

him from the service. But the Respondents have not taken any of those steps either.

Even though, in the statement of objections of the Respondents it has been stated that

the vacation of post notice marked R-1 was served on the Petitioner, at the Argument

the learned State Counsel admitted that R-1 relates to a previous occasion and not to

the occasion which relates to the instant action. Under the above stated circumstances,

I am of the view that the 1st to 4th Respondents have neglected/failed to perform their

official duties.

The administrative decisions should be taken by the decision makers in the proper and

correct stage following the proper steps to ensure smooth functioning of the State

mechanism. Failures and/or delays in taking administrative decisions would cause

adverse effects to the State affairs. The failures and delays could be due to various

reasons like non-commitment to duty, negligence, reluctance, favourism, bias, etc.

The malpractices of the State officers could lead to bribery and corruption also and

ultimately would jeopardize the entire system. Due to the inaction of decision makers

to take decisions, there could be instance where the State should be liable to bear

unnecessary expenses/costs. For instance, the State would be liable to pay damages,

compensation or wages to the general public or to the State officers.

The Petitioner in this action has not rendered his services to the State from 05.05.2017

to 06.09.2018. As hereinbefore stated, the 1st to 4th Respondents have failed to take

11

steps to retire the Petitioner or to offer him an opportunity to present his facts before

making the decision contained in P-18. They have also failed to take steps to serve a

vacation of post notice on the Petitioner or to dismiss him from the service when he

did not report to work on 05.05.2017 at the end of the vacation leave. The Petitioner

has not reported for work not because of his fault, but assuming that he would be

retired once leave prior retirement is expired. Therefore, I am of the view that the

Petitioner should be entitled to his salary for that period. Nevertheless, the Petitioner

has not rendered his services to the State during that period. Therefore, the Court

cannot order the State to bear the amount which the petitioner should have been

entitled as his salary for that period. As mentioned above, as the 1st to 4th Respondents

have failed/neglected to perform their official duties, I hold that they are jointly

responsible to pay an amount equating to the net salary which the Petitioner could

have been earned during that period to him as compensation. Furthermore, I hold that

for the purpose of deciding the pension benefits of the Petitioner that period should be

considered as a period which the Petitioner had been in the active service. Subject to

the above stated variations Court will issue a writ of Certiorari as prayed for in prayer

(c) to the Petition. The 1st to 4th Respondents should personally pay Rs. 10 000/- each

as costs to the Petitioner.
