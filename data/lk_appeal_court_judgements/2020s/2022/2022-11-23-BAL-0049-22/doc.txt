The suspect in the instant matter has been produced before the

Magistrates Court of Kalawana for a case of abduction attempted

murder and causing grievous hurt. On 13.04.2022 the Kalawana Police

had received a complaint from Gayathri Ishara stating that the suspect

entered her house and threatened her with death in order to withdraw

the above mentioned case. The inmates of the house had corroborated

this incident. The suspect had been produced under the above

mentioned Act for the complaint made by Gayathri Ishara and he had

been remanded by the Magistrate under the provisions of the above

mentioned Act.

The Counsel for the Suspect denied this allegation and stated that the

document marked as P4 is a medical report of the suspect and that he is

undergoing a depressive disorder with psychotic features, as such he

urged Court to consider enlarging the suspect on bail.

The Counsel appearing for the Attorney General objected to this

application.

Having considered the submissions of both parties, the law pertaining to

the instant Act is that once a suspect is produced under this Act bail can

be considered only by the Court of Appeal under exceptional

Circumstance. The term exceptional has not been defined in the

statute, but in the many of our decided cases it has been concluded that

exceptionality defers from case to case. In the instant matter the

exceptionality pleaded is the mental condition of the suspect. It has

been decided in the case of Ram Thamodaranpille that the ill health of

the accused can be considered only if the incarceration endangers his

life, but we also note that in the case of Ramu Thamodarumpillai bail

is considered after conviction hence the likelihood of the accused

absconding is higher than in a case where trial is yet to commence, as

in the instant matter. The document marked and produced by the

petitioner as P4 says that the suspect suffers from psychotic features.

This Court also observe that although investigations had been

concluded (as pleaded by the State Counsel) State Counsel failed to

state as to indictment would be filed against the suspect. Hence there

is an ambiguity pertaining to his period in remand which we consider is

a violation of the objective of this Act. It is very well known that the

above mentioned Act has been enacted to safeguard the rights of

witnesses and victims. But in the same Act it has been stated that

matters pertaining to this Act should be given precedence over others.

But in the instant matter we do not see such a situation. As such the

instant application for bail is allowed. The Learned Magistrate is

directed to enlarge the suspect on suitable conditions of bail on receipt

of this order without delay.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
