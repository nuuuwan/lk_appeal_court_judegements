The TAC clearly erred in not considering the fact that the passengers who arrived in Sri Lanka on the SriLankan Layover Programme, may also leave the airport for accommodation in Hotels and undertake tours up to a period of 1-14 days as per Annex 1, and such passengers are in fact tourists. The TAC completely disregarded the fact that those optional 1-14 day tours selected by the foreign passengers who arrive in Sri Lanka fall within the purview of the Sri Lankan Layover Programme set out in the Agreement.

Their language may sometimes be careless and they may have said things which, if taken literally, mean something different from what they obviously intended...

The Supreme Court considered the question whether a written contract which appears on its face to be intended to govern the relationship between them necessarily falls within a particular legal description or labelling or categorisation of a relationship governed by the said written contract.",

    "text": "A court of justice in construing a document should have less regard to its letter than to its general sense and intention. This rule constitutes an important modification of the rule discussed in the preceding section. Thus the court will not consider the mere name given to a transaction, but will rather see what the transaction really is in truth and in fact upon a consideration of all the facts relating to it. The rule that the real intention is to be preferred to the ordinary meaning of words where such intention is clear is the first rule of interpretation laid down by Pothier. Where the intention is clear neither grammar nor punctuation will prevail against it, for the language of Blacktone, neither false English nor bad Latin will destroy a deed. Thus, the courts will not attach overmuch importance to the use in a document of such words as agent mortgage or pledge guarantee, kaikili or stridanum or koratuwa, but will examine the transaction in order to determine its true nature. The real intention of the parties has similarly prevailed where the property sold was erroneously described, but its identity was clear, and where a transaction was described by the parties as an exchange but was in reality two sales. [45] It is significant to note that the entire agreement must be looked at, which in turn must be construed against the surrounding factual matrix at the time of its making. In discovering the true intention of the parties what they in fact intended by a particular word used, particular regard must be given to the parties underlying commercial aims, importance, objectives, rights and obligations in entering into the contract, their legal and factual background like a business like interpretation. The High Court of Australia in Toll (FGCR) Pty Ltd v. Alphapharm Pty Ltd (2004) 129 CLR 165 at 179 reaffirmed the same principle in the following words:",
