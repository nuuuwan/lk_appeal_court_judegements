The brief facts of the case as per the evidence of the prosecution are as follows; The Chief Inspector Ansalam Silva (PW1), has been serving in the Colombo crimes division. Upon receiving information from a private informant, he has organized the raid in question. The information had been that, a person would be coming near the bridge at Leslie Ranagala Mawatha carrying heroin. Accordingly, he has gone to the area in a van attached to their division along with the other police officers. They have stopped the vehicle near the air force official quarters, and had proceeded towards the bridge at Leslie Ranagala Mawatha. He has walked slowly while observing the area, as he wanted to mark the time. He has identified the suspect who was coming towards the bridge, according to the information he received. When the appellant came close to him, he has called him out, taken him to a side of the road and searched him. His officers, Fonseka and Bandara have been standing close to him. When he searched the appellant, he has felt that there was a parcel inside his underwear. Then, he has discovered a red coloured cellophane bag that contained heroin in his underwear.",

Therefore, it is obvious that the injuries of the appellant occurred after he was handed over to the reserve police officer, following his arrest by the raiding party, and while he was detained. Thus, the so called assault has no impact on the credibility of the evidence of the raiding party that the appellant was arrested while in possession of heroin. There is no evidence of any previous enmity between the officers of the raiding party and the appellant. The learned High Court Judge in his judgment has clearly and sufficiently considered the defence evidence at pages 26 and 27 of his judgment (pages 233 and 234 of the appeal brief). He has given good and sufficient reasons for rejecting the version of the defence. Hence, I find that there is no merit in the grounds of appeal urged by the appellant.",
