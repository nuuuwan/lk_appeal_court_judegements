JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named 1st Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted along with 2nd accused and others unknown to the

prosecution, in the High Court of Puttalam under Section 296 read with

Section 32 of the Penal Code for committing the murder of Mohammed

Nauf Mohammed Naim on or about 27th April 2002.

As the 2nd accused absconded the court before commencement of the trial,

an inquiry was held under Section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act No.15 of 1979 and fixed the case in absentia of 2nd accused on

29/05/2008.

Trial commenced before the High Court Judge as the Appellant had opted

for a non-jury trial. After the conclusion of the prosecution case, the

learned High Court Judge had called for the defence and the Appellant had

given evidence from the witness box and closed his case. After considering

3 | P a g e

the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High Court Judge had

convicted the Appellant and the 2nd accused as charged and sentenced

them to death on 09/11/2017.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the

Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the

Covid 19 pandemic. During the argument he was connected via Zoom from

prison. The 2nd accused was not represented by a counsel.

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. The Learned Trial Judge erred on facts and law.

2. The prosecution had failed to establish the identity of the Appellant.

3. The Learned Trial Judge had misdirected himself as to the proof of

ingredients of the Section 32 of the Penal Code.

4. Relying on the evidence of PW1, the purported eye witness, is highly

unsafe given the impeached character.

Background of the case

According to PW01 Abdul Mohamed, on the day of the incident he had gone

to meet the deceased who had been a candidate of the Local Government

Election. He had met the deceased at about 9.00 p.m. at a Mosque namely

Thakkiya. As it was raining heavily with lightning and both had sheltered

there until the ceasing of the rain. At that time, another three to four

people also remained there due to gusty weather. He named three persons

by name. According to him Nusrul, Huq and Siyan were there. The place

was dark as the electricity had gone off due to bad weather.

4 | P a g e

At that time, a car had arrived there and stopped about 88 feet away from

them. The head light of the car was turned off when it arrived there. He had

seen three to four people were inside the car through the hood light when

the doors were opened. About three people had got down the car and

started firing towards them. As the boundary wall of the mosque was

covered with roofing sheets, the bullets struck on the roofing sheet and

created loud noise. Due to the darkness, he could not identify the type of

the gun. According to the witness, he had identified the Appellant and his

brother, the 2nd accused, when they alighted from the car with the help of

the hood light of the car. He had witnessed an object similar to a gun was

in the possession of 2nd accused. When the shooting commenced, the

deceased shouting Allah had fallen on the ground. According to him,

lightning also helped him to identify the appellant and his brother properly.

But at the High Court trial he had added lights of the passing vehicle too

helped him to identify the assailants.

As he feared, he had run into the mosque and washed his leg. At that time,

he had noticed that he too had sustained injuries on one of his legs. He

had stayed there for nearly two hours due to fear before being taken to the

hospital. Further, he stated that he received threats after the incident. He

had given a statement but was not sure whether he had named the

Appellant and his brother at that time. There was no charge in the

indictment for his injuries.

During the cross examination, the witness was unable to determine which

side of the car the Appellant and his brother exited from. However, he

admitted in the non-summary proceedings that he had told court that the

Appellant had alighted from the driving seat of the car before firing. This

contradiction was marked as V1 by the defence. At the inquest

proceedings, the PW1 had said that the Appellant had come in a red car

whereas, at the High Court he had said that the Appellant and others had

5 | P a g e

come in a nickel-coloured car. This contradiction had been marked as V2

by the defence.

When the trial was resumed before a new High Court Judge, PW1 was

recalled and subjected to cross examination by the defence. At the cross

examination, the witness admitted that he did not mention anybodys name

to the doctor. He also admitted that once he was arrested for possession of

arms by the police.

When the defence was called, the Appellant had given evidence from the

witness box and denied the charge. According to him, he was at his

mothers place with his wife and children when the incident had taken

place. He also called 02 witnesses on his behalf.

During the argument, the learned Counsel who appeared for the Appellant

mainly argued that the prosecution had failed to prove the identity of the

Appellant as the perpetrator, beyond reasonable doubt and applicability of

evidence of sole eye witness as cogent.

As this case is rests on the proper and correct identification of the

Appellant as perpetrator and its high persuasive nature, this Court invited

the Counsel for the Appellant to argue on the second ground of appeal

which states that the prosecution had failed to establish the identity of the

Appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

As most of the time the proper identification of an accused person is the

fundamental important issue that needs to be determined in a criminal

trial. In this case it is very important to discuss whether the prosecution

had established the identity of the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

6 | P a g e

Phipson, in his book titled Phipson on Evidence (Sweet & Maxwell

Thomson Reuters,17th Edn.2015) states that:

it is often important to establish the identity of a person who a witness

testifies that he saw on a relevant occasion. Sometimes, the witness will

testify that he had seen the person before, or even know the person well,

and therefore recognised the person observed on the relevant occasion.

Like in this case, many crimes are committed under poor light conditions

when none is able to identify the accused person properly. In those

circumstances the case will entirely rest on the proper identification of the

accused person. If the identification is compromised, the net result would

be the acquittal of the accused person from the case. Hence identification

evidence should be considered very seriously owing to its persuasive

nature.

In Alexander v. R (1981) 145 CLR 395 at 426, Mason,J stated that:

Identification is notoriously uncertain. It depends upon so many

variables. They include the difficulty one has in recognising on a

subsequent occasion a person observed, perhaps fleetingly, on a former

occasion; the extent of the opportunity for observation on a variety of

circumstances; the vagaries of human perception and recollection; and

the tendency of the mind to respond to suggestions, notably the tendency

to substitute a photographic image once seen for a hazy recollection of the

person initially observed.

7 | P a g e

In Visveswaran v. State (2003) 6 SCC 73 the court held that:

Before we notice the circumstances proving the case against the

appellant and establishing his identity beyond reasonable doubt, it has

to be borne in mind that the approach required to be adopted by courts in

such cases has to be different. The cases are required to be dealt with

utmost sensitivity. (..) Further, the evidence is required to be

appreciated having regards to the background of the entire case and not

in isolation.

In Turnbull [1977] QB 224 the Court of Appeal laid down the following

guidelines for judges in trials that involve disputed identification evidence.

Where the case against an accused depends wholly or substantially on

the correctness of one or more identifications of the accused, which the

defence alleges to be mistaken, the judge should warn the jury of the

special need for caution before convicting the accused in reliance on the

correctness of the identification(s).

The judge should tell the jury that:

(i) caution is required to avoid the risk of injustice;

(ii) a witness who is honest may be wrong even if they are

convinced, they are right;

(iii) a witness who is convincing may still be wrong;

(iv) more than one witness may be wrong;

(v) a witness who recognises the defendant, even when the witness

knows the defendant very well, may be wrong.

The Judge should direct the jury to examine closely the circumstances in

which the identification by each witness came to be made.

8 | P a g e

Some of these circumstances may include:

(i) the length of time the accused was observed by the witness;

(ii) the distance the witness was from the accused;

(iii) the state of the light;

(iv) the length of time elapsed between the original observation and

the subsequent identification to the police.

Guided by the above-mentioned judgments and writings, I now assess

whether the prosecution in this instance has proven the Appellants

identification beyond reasonable doubt, as mistaken identity occurs

frequently in good faith, but the consequences can be extremely serious for

the Appellant. Therefore, the cases of this nature must be dealt with

utmost sensitivity.

PW01 in his evidence stated that it was pitch dark due to gusty weather

when the incident had happened. Further, power failure also aggravated

the bad light condition. Importantly, according to PW1, the firing had

originated from about 88 feet distance. When the car in which the

Appellant and others arrived, the headlights of the car had been switched

off immediately. Hence, PW1 had identified the Appellant and the 2nd

accused from the hood light of the car when its doors were opened.

Although he had said that the 2nd accused had a gun in his possession, but

he was unable to confirm whether the Appellant too had possessed any

weapon. Further, in the non-summary proceedings, PW1 had said that the

Appellant was in the driving seat when the car arrived at the scene. But

during the High Court trial he had taken up the position that the Appellant

alighted from the rear side of the car and not from the driving seat. This

contradiction was marked as V1. Further, at the inquest proceedings, the

witness had said that the Appellant and others had arrived in a red

coloured car. But in the High Court he had said that a nickel-coloured car

had arrived. This contradiction was marked as V2. These two

contradictions are very important as the incident had happened under

9 | P a g e

cover of the darkness. This has escaped from the consideration of the trial

judge.

The investigating officer had only recorded the statement of PW1 whereas,

PW1 had named several other people who were also there at the time of the

incident. Hence, I consider it is a serious lapse on the part of investigation

to collect all evidence necessary for consideration by the court.

The Learned High Court Judge had admitted that the evidence presented

by the prosecution does not reveal as to who fired at the deceased,

whereas, PW1 had said that he saw a gun in the possession of 2nd accused.

The relevant portion of the judgment is re-produced below:

(Page No. 273 of the brief).

Although the charge is framed that the Appellant and the 2nd accused with

others unknown to the prosecution had committed the murder of the

deceased, but the evidence given by PW01 well established that the light

condition was not perfect at all. But the learned High Court judge in his

judgment mentioned that the Appellant had been properly identified by

PW01.The learned High Court Judge had failed to take into account the

duration taken by PW1 to observe the Appellant in the light of the hood of

the car.

The Learned Deputy Solicitor General in his reply submitted to this Court

that he leaves the question of proper identity of the Appellant as the

perpetrator to the consideration of this Court. Also submitted to this Court

10 | P a g e

that relying on the evidence of the sole eye witness is not safe, considering

the probability factor.

Hence, I conclude that the second ground of appeal has merit as the

learned High Court Judge has failed to appreciate the weak evidence

pertaining to the identity of the Appellant. As the Appellants identity is

highly doubted in this case, the benefit of the doubt should be accrued to

the Appellant. The remaining grounds of appeal will not be considered as

the Appellant has successfully established that he was not properly

identified by the sole eye witness PW01 which is a substantial fact in this

case.

Accordingly, I allow the appeal and acquit the Appellant and the 2nd

accused, although he has not lodged an appeal, from the murder charge.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to

the High Court of Puttalam along with the original case record.
