The Petitioners were given assurance by the 1st Respondent that they would be allocated shops at the New Commercial Complex being built at Station Road, Kalutara. On or about March 2018, the Petitioners were summoned to the Kalutara District Office of the UDA and were required to submit proof of the shops they operated at the Delkada Complex. The Petitioners state that after perusing the documents submitted by them, the UDA verbally intimated to them that they would be allocated shops at the aforesaid New Commercial Complex. However, as per the document marked P4, the Petitioners were allocated only one shop. The Petitioners further state that by giving a single shop to two persons who had two separate shops previously, the Respondents had acted contrary to the legitimate expectation of the Petitioners.",

Good government depends upon trust between the governed and the governor. Unless that trust is sustained and protected officials will not be believed and the government becomes a choice between chaos and coercion. It is not enough that an expectation should exist: it must in addition be legitimate. But how is it to be determined whether a particular expectation is worthy of protection? This is a difficult area since an expectation reasonably entertained by a person may not be found to be legitimate because of some countervailing consideration of policy or law. A crucial requirement is that the assurance must itself be clear, unequivocal and unambiguous. Many claimants fail at this hurdle after a close analysis of the assurance. The test is how on a fair reading of the promise it would have been reasonably understood by those to whom it was made. (Page 452).",

Furthermore, as per the document marked P7, the Petitioners can have legitimate expectations to obtain two shops. The determination made by the Respondents as to the fact that the previous two shops were amalgamated is unfounded and unsupported. This Court is mindful of the fact that there is no basis, criteria or material for the Respondents to arrive at a decision that one shop would be given to the amalgamated two shops. In these circumstances, it is the view of this Court that the decisions contained in the documents marked 4R1 and 4R2 are arbitrary and a violation of natural justice that would desecrate the legitimate expectations of the Petitioners.",
