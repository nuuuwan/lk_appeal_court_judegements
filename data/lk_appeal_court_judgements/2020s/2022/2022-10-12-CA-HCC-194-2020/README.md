Iddawala - J

This is an appeal filed against the judgment of the learned High Court

Judge of High Court of Colombo dated 22.01.2020 bearing Case No. HCB

2046/2014. The facts of the case are as follows. The accused-appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was an Assistant Director of

Education at Nikaweratiya Education Office. Appellant had solicited

300,000/= from Thennakoon Mudiyanselage Nisansala Swarnamali

Thennakoon (hereinafter referred to as PW1) and on or about 02.07.2011

had accepted 200,000/= from Dissanyake Mudiyanselage Bandara

Manike Dissanayake (the mother of PW1) as a gratification to facilitate an

employment for PW1 at the Bank of Ceylon. On 22.01.2020 appellant was

convicted by the learned High Court Judge for four counts under the

Bribery Act No. 11 of 1954 as amended (hereinafter referred to as the

Bribery Act).

1. Count 1 For soliciting a gratification of 300,000/= as an

inducement or reward to assist obtaining an employment which is

an offence punishable under section 20(b) read with section 20 (a)

iv of the Bribery Act.

2. Count 2 For the same cause of action as Count 1, being a public

servant soliciting a gratification of 300,000/= which is an offence

punishable under section 19 (c) of the Bribery Act.

3. Count 3 - For accepting a gratification of 200,000/= as an

inducement or reward to assist obtaining an employment which is

an offence punishable under section 20(b) read with section 20 (a)

iv of the Bribery Act.

4. Count 4 - For the same cause of action as Count 3, being a public

servant accepting a gratification of 200,000/= which is an offence

punishable under section 19 (c) of the Bribery Act.

For each count the learned High Court Judge has imposed 5 years of

rigorous imprisonment with a fine of 5,000/= and if in default 1 year of

CA-HCC-194-20 Page 4 of 5 12/10/2022 IJ-44-22

rigorous imprisonment. Sentences pertaining to 1st and 2nd counts are

imposed to run concurrently and sentences pertaining to 3rd and 4th

counts are imposed to run concurrently. In addition to this the learned

High Court Judge has ordered to pay a sum of 200,000/= as a penalty

under section 26 of the Bribery Act and if in default 1 year of rigorous

imprisonment.

The appeal at hand is to set aside the judgment of the learned High Court

Judge. However, on the day of the argument Presidents Counsel appearing

for the appellant did not challenge the conviction but appreciated a

variance in the sentence. The learned Deputy Solicitor-General appearing

for the Bribery Commission (Respondent) stated that the sentence imposed

by the learned High Court Judge is in order and is legal and further

conceded that however sentencing is under the discretion of the court.

At this instance, I would like to draw the attention to section 16 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 as amended.

16 1) When a person is convicted at one trial of any two or more

distinct offences the court may, subject to section 301, sentence him

for such offences to the several punishments prescribed therefor

which such court is competent to inflict; such punishments when

consisting of imprisonment to commence, unless the court orders

them or any of them to run concurrently, the one after the expiration

of the other in such order as the court may direct, even where the

aggregate punishment for the several offences is in excess of the

punishment which the court is competent to inflict on conviction of

one single offence;

Thus, as per this provision it is in the discretion of the court to allow

sentences in case of conviction for several offences at one trial to run

concurrently. Considering the cogent and persuasive submissions made

by the learned Presidents Counsel behalf of the appellant and the fact that

all four charges against the appellant are occasioned in the same

CA-HCC-194-20 Page 5 of 5 12/10/2022 IJ-44-22

transaction, this Court inclines to allow varying the sentence. Thereby, all

four sentences imposed by the learned High Court Judge for the four

counts shall run concurrently with effect from 22.01.2020, the date of

conviction.

Subject to the aforementioned variance of the sentence, appeal is

dismissed.
