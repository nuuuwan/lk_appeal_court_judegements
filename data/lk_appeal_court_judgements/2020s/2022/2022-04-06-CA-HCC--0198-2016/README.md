JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of Matara

for committing three counts of incest on his daughter namely Bopehetti

Arachchige Nadeeka between 10/03/2000 to 10/05/2000 an offence

punishable under Section 364(3) of the Penal Code as amended.

After the trial, the Appellant was convicted only for the first count and was

sentenced to 18 years RI and a fine of Rs.10000/-, in default for which 06

months simple imprisonment had been imposed.

The Appellant was acquitted from the 2nd and 3rd charges of the indictment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has provided his consent for this matter to be argued in his absence due to

the Covid 19 pandemic. During the argument he was connected via Zoom

from prison.

The Counsel for the Appellant advanced the following grounds of appeal:

1. Patent lack of jurisdiction of the court.

2. That the whole case for the prosecution is based on DNA evidence

which is at best can only be considered as mere expert evidence and

cannot be considered as conclusive evidence especially in the absence

of other probative evidence.

3. That the victim was not 16 years old at the time and the date of birth

was not proved by the prosecution.

3 | P a g e

In the first ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the charges had

been filed without the sanction of the Hon. Attorney General. Hence it is

lacking the jurisdiction of the court.

In the third ground of Appeal the Appellant contends that the victim was not

16 years old at the time and the date of birth was not proved by the

prosecution.

As these two grounds are interrelated, these grounds will be considered

jointly in this appeal.

In this case the Appellant was indicted on 03 counts for having committed

an offence on three occasions between 10th March, 2000, to 10th May 2000

under section 364(3) of the Penal Code as amended that is, committing rape

on the victim Bopehetti Archchige Nadeeka who was under 16 years of age

when she stood in a relationship towards him as enumerated in Section

364(A) (1) of the Penal Code as amended.

Section 364(3) of the Penal Code states:

Whoever commits rape on a woman under sixteen years of age and the

woman stands towards the man in any of the degrees of relationships

enumerated in Section 364A shall on conviction be punished with

rigorous imprisonment, for a term not less than fifteen years and not

exceeding twenty years and with fine.

Section 364A (1) of Penal Code states:

Whoever has sexual intercourse with another, who stands towards

him in any of the following enumerated degrees of relationship, that is

to say

a) either party is directly descended from the other or is the adoptive

parent, adoptive grandparent, adopted child or adopted grandchild of

the other; or

4 | P a g e

b) the female, is the sister of the male, either by the full or the half-blood

or by adoption, or is the daughter of his brother or of his sister, by the

full or the half blood or by adoption, or is a descendant from either of

them, or is the daughter of his wife by another father, or is his sons

or grandsons or fathers or grandfather's widow; or

c) the male, is the brother of the female either by the full or the half blood

or by adoption, or is the son of her brother or sister by the full or the

half blood or by adoption or is a descendant from either of them, or is

the son of her husband by another mother, or is her diseased

daughter's or granddaughters or mother's or grandmothers husband,

commits the offence of 'incest'.

364A (4) states:

No prosecution shall be commenced for an offence under this

section except with the written sanction of the Attorney

General.

In this case the Appellant was not charged under 364A of the Penal Code as

amended. He was charged under Section 364(3) of the Penal Code as

amended. The sole reason for mentioning 364A of the Penal Code as

amended in the body of the charge framed under 364(3) is to establish the

prohibited sexual intercourse the Appellant had with his biological daughter.

Hence, it is crystal clear that the Attorney Generals sanction is required only

if the Appellant is indicted under Section 364A of the Penal Code as

amended. In this case as the Appellant had been indicted under section

364(3) of the Penal Code as amended, the Attorney Generals sanction is not

necessary.

The Appellant further argue that the victim was not 16 years old at the time

and the date of birth was not proved by the prosecution.

5 | P a g e

In this case when the prosecution led evidence of the victim, she had deviated

her stance taken in the complaint lodged against the Appellant. After leading

some evidence, as she did not come out with the prosecutions version, on

an application by the prosecution the victim was remanded. When her

evidence resumed after the remand, she again adopted the same evasive

attitude towards the prosecution case. Hence, an application was made by

the prosecuting counsel under Section 154 of the Evidence Ordinance to

question PW1.

The High Court Judge in his judgment correctly analysed the probative value

of the victims evidence. Once the application made under Section 154 of the

Evidence Ordinance to question the own witness, the evidence given by the

said witness has only little value, like in this case. Hence, it is very important

to consider the other available evidence to come to a conclusion in a case.

PW09, the doctor who examined the victim and issued the Medico Legal

Report has stated that when he examined the victim, she was 57 days after

child birth. According to this witness the victim had given birth to a child on

15th of January, 2001. According to the calculation of the doctor the victim

could have conceived in the month of April, 2000.

According to P3, the birth certificate of the victim states that she was born

on 11/04/1984. Considering the time period mentioned in the indictment,

the victim was under 16 years of age when she was raped.

In this case the defence had not challenged the medical evidence during the

trial. Hence evidence pertaining to the age of the victim cannot be taken as

an appeal ground before this court.

6 | P a g e

The Court of Appeal in Bandara v. The State C.A. 27/99 held that:

when there is ample opportunity to contradict the evidence of

a witness but is not impugned or assailed in cross-examination

that is a special fact and feature in the case, it is a matter falling

within the definition of the word proof in section 3 of the

Evidence Ordinance and a trial judge or court must necessarily

take the fact in to consideration in adjudicating the issue before

it.

In Ukkuwa v. The Attorney General [2002] 3 SLR 279, is a case where

Justice S. Tilakawardene held that matters of fact that could have been

challenged and clarified at the Trial Court are precluded from being

challenged at the Appellate Court in the following manner at page 282;

court is mindful of the fact that having had the opportunity to cross-

examine the witness before the original court and having failed or

neglected to avail himself of the opportunity of such examination on

these matters which could have been clarified, had such objections or

cross-examination being raised in the original court, the counsel is

precluded from challenging so the veracity of such matters of fact before

this court.

In Gunasiri and Two Others v. Republic of Sri Lanka C.A. 116/13, the

Court of Appeal held that:

it is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has

declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross-

examination it must follow that the evidence tendered on that

issue ought to be accepted.

7 | P a g e

Considering the above-mentioned judgments, the appeal grounds advanced

by the Appellant under number one and three have no merit.

In the second ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the whole case

for the prosecution based on DNA evidence which is at best can only be

considered as mere expert evidence and cannot be considered as conclusive

evidence especially in the absence of other probative evidence.

In this case the Appellant, the victim and the child born out of this sexual

intercourse were subjected to a DNA test to ascertain the biological father of

the child. Upon a Court Order being issued the Genetech Institution had

conducted the DNA test and submitted their findings to the court. According

to the report dated 25/07/2012 under reference No.

28908/PTT/2012/03/23 the results of the DNA test established that the

Appellant is the biological father of the child born to the victim in this case.

PW11 who prepared the DNA report under the court order had given

comprehensive evidence as to the applicability and accuracy of a DNA report

in a criminal case. According to this witness the accuracy of a DNA report to

establish the paternity is 99.999%. The said DNA report was marked as P2

by the prosecution.

This witness was cross examined regarding the correct identity of the

persons who were subjected to DNA test and accuracy of taking blood

samples for the test. The witness endorsed that he was personally present

when the blood samples were taken from the Appellant, the victim and the

child. Thereby, he vouched for the 100% accuracy of the report.

The use of DNA evidence in the criminal justice system has been regarded

by scholars as probably the greatest forensic advancement since the advent

of fingerprinting.

In The Attorney General v. M. N. Naufer alias Potta Naufer and Others

[2007] 2 SLR 144 the court held that:

An individuals genetic constitution is unique in so much as there are no

two individuals who have the same DNA. By analysing DNA of an

8 | P a g e

individual, it is possible to say that the chances of finding another person

with matching DNA is less than one in a trillion. This is analogous to

hand finger printing techniques and that is why DNA finger printing has

received the degree of acceptability which is similar to hand

fingerprinting in courts the world over.

Counsel for the Appellant advanced the argument that the DNA is not a

conclusive proof against an accused as it has inherent weaknesses and

therefore, solely relying on DNA evidence only creates serious doubt in the

prosecution case. To support his claim the counsel has submitted several

foreign judgments for the consideration of the court.

In C. Premjibhai Bachubhai Khasiya v. State of Gujarat and another

[2009] CRI.L.J. 2888 the court held that:

The science of DNA is at a developing stage and when the Random

Occurrence Ratio is not available for Indian Society, it would be risky to

act solely on a positive DNA report, because only if the DNA profile of the

accused matches with the foetus, it cannot be considered as conclusive

proof of paternity. Contrarily, if it is solitary piece of evidence with

negative result, it would conclusively exclude the possibility of

involvement of the accused in the offence.

Hence the Indian Courts look for other supporting evidence along with the

positive D.N.A. report.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge considering the demeanour of the

prosecutrix, has taken into consideration the fact that the prosecutrix was a

young girl who had to give evidence against her own father. Further, the

learned trial judge has analysed the prosecutrixs evidence and has acted

upon certain portions of her evidence, which are supported by expert

evidence given by the PW11 and PW9 who prepared the D.N.A. and Medico

Legal reports respectively.

9 | P a g e

The Learned High Court Judge has acted upon the evidence of the

prosecutrix based on the concept of divisibility of evidence and cited the

relevant judgement mentioned below in support of his conclusion.

In Samaraweera v. AG [1990] 1 SLR 256 the court held that:

The maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus (could not be applied in

such circumstances) the credibility of witnesses can be treated as

divisible and accepted against one and rejected against another. The jury

or judge must decide for themselves whether that part of the testimony

which is found to be false taints the whole or whether the false can safely

be separated from the true.

DNA evidence has now been accepted by our courts as a science upon which

expert evidence could be led in terms of Section 45 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

Section 45 of the Evidence Ordinance states:

When the Court has to form an opinion as to foreign law, or of science, or

art, or as to identity or genuineness of handwriting or finger impressions,

palm impressions or foot impressions, the opinions upon that point of

persons specially skilled in such foreign law, science, or art, or in questions

as to identity or genuineness of handwriting or finger impressions, palm

impressions or foot impressions, are relevant facts.

How that expert evidence should be considered by a trial judge is discussed

in several decided cases in our criminal justice system.

In Mark Antony Fernando v. AG CA/84/97 decided on 08/10/1998 the

court held that:

the judge has to decide () whether there was a very great antecedent

probability of the injury resulting in death as opposed to a mere likelihood.

10 | P a g e

That function cannot be delegated to the expert. The judge is expected to

decide this issue assisted by the evidence of the expert but independently of

the opinion expressed by the expert.

Dr. Ruwan J. Illeperuma, an expert in DNA Technology elaborates in his

article titled DNA, THE BIOLOGICAL TOOL FOR CRIME INVESTIGATION

IN SRI LANKA as follows:

Because each persons DNA is different from that of every other

individual (except for identical twins) examining variations in genetic

material among human individuals, by DNA technology is the most

powerful method for accurate human identification. DNA can be

isolated from a number of biological samples, such as hair, saliva,

blood, bone, teeth etc. The technology currently being applied is so

sensitive that even a miniscule amount of bodily fluid or tissue can yield

accurate DNA information. Therefore, this technology has a wide

application in identifying perpetrators of crime and in confirming

familial relationships of humans. (..). The level of accuracy achievable

guarantees absolutely no risk of convicting the wrong person and

thereby establishing the innocence of those wrongly convicted.

Therefore, an expert in DNA analysis plays a vital role in sexual abuse cases

relating to children. Their opinion could assist prosecuting authorities in

identifying the person against whom criminal charges should be framed, as

in this case. Their opinion also provides great assistance to the court in the

proper adjudication of the matter.

As the Learned High Court Judge had meticulously considered the

acceptable evidence along with the DNA evidence properly, I conclude that

the second ground of appeal also does not have any merit.

When analysing entirety of the evidence presented, I am of the view that the

prosecution had proved the case against the Appellant beyond reasonable

11 | P a g e

doubt. Hence, I affirm the conviction and sentence imposed on him by the

Learned High Court Judge of Matara.

I further order that the sentence imposed on the Appellant to be operative

from the date of conviction namely 17/10/2016, given the fact that the

Appellant has been in incarceration since the conviction.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to High Court of

Matara along with the original case record.

The appeal is dismissed.
