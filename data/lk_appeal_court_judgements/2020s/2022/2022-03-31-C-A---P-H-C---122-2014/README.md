JUDGMENT

The Petitioner-Appellant had made this application to set aside the Judgment dated 30.07.2014

of the High Court of Badulla. Further pleaded to grant reliefs (iii) (iv) and (v) prayed for in the

original Petition for cost and other reliefs.

By the Petition dated 22.08.2014, the Petitioner had stated his grievances.

The Petitioner had served under three owners or co-owners as a tenant cultivator in the

Muwanarawa paddy field. From the said paddy field, one co-owner was entitled to thirty-seven

perches, namely the father of the 1st Respondent (W.R.D. Appuhamy), applied under section 5

Page 3 of 7

(a) (1) of the Agrarian Services Act No.4 of 1991. However, as the Act was cancelled and a new

Act No.46 of 2000 was introduced, the inquiry was laid by.

The 1st Respondent later became the owner of the thirty-seven perches and informed the

Petitioner that he was willing to transfer the land to the tenant cultivator for a sum of Seven

hundred rupees (7 lakhs). This was informed by a notice under Section 2(1) of the Agrarian

Development Act No.46 of 2000.

Meanwhile, the Petitioner had purchased two lots. To demarcate the boundaries of his lands, he

had filed a partition case in the District Court of Walimada. As there was a dispute regarding

the price quoted, the Agrarian Services Board decided to hold an inquiry under section 2(4). An

officer was appointed to hold the inquiry. The decision was conveyed to the Petitioner to buy the

said 37 perches at a sum of Four lakhs ninety-nine thousand five hundred rupees during the

specified time, namely three weeks.

An inquiry was held under Section 2(4) of the Agrarian Development Act. Without any

information or notice to the Appellant. Magistrate Court's order of case No.13292 was produced

to eject the Petitioner. Without notice or summoning him before the Magistrate, ejecting him

from a land he had been enjoying was contested by the Petitioner.

For this purpose, the Petitioner filed papers in the High Court of Badulla, praying for a Writ of

Mandamus and certiorari, among other reliefs. The Writ Application No.29/13 was the case filed

in the High Court of Badulla. After holding an inquiry, the learned High Court judge delivered

an order dated 30.07.2014 dismissing the application. Aggrieved by the said decision, the

Appellant had sought the intervention of this Court.

All parties agreed to dispose of the matter by way of written submissions. The Petitioner-

Substituted Appellant had set out three main points which he had stressed as points to be

considered in his favour. The rule of natural justice was violated as he was not heard before

marking the impugned decision by the Agrarian Services Authority.

In support of this point, the Appellant points out that he was never heard before making the order

of ejectment. Section 8 of the Act No.46 of 2008 has not complied. This section provides for the

Page 4 of 7

Commissioner-General or any person authorized by the Commissioner to present a written report

which should include failure to vacate an extent of land.

Even though 37 perches are mentioned in the present case, boundaries are not discussed.

Therefore, from what land he is to be ejected is uncertain. On this ground of unidentified

boundaries itself, the Respondents' application should fail. When perusing the Respondents'

submissions, it is clear that the 37 perches are the 37 perches transferred by the owner to whom

the Petitioner was a tenant cultivator. Even though no specific demarcation of boundaries, the

Petitioner had identified what belonged to the 1st Respondent over the years. His participation

at the inquiry, where he was offered to buy the land within three weeks, proves his knowledge

of the land.

As to violating the rule Audi alteram partem in perusing the document [V2] it had given

boundaries North by Kadura South by Galwata, w., Badalla, East by Badala, Kadura West by

Balance of the same land.

The documents [V4] prove that an inquiry was held where R.M. Jayawardena was represented by

an Attorney-at-Law, namely Mr Sugath Jayawardena. The Petitioner had failed to show any

lapses on the part of the Respondents. The point on lawful delegation of powers has not been

conferred on the Agrarian Development official to cause the Appellant to be ejected also fails as

the document produced indicates the delegation of power.

Whether the paddy land can be identified or not was discussed earlier. Even though these were

the facts of this case, Court should consider the order of the learned High Court judge. His

reasons for the refusal of the application of the Petitioner.

Section 42 of the Agrarian Development Act No.46 of 2000 reads as follows:

"The decision of an Agrarian Tribunal on any application, complaint or appeal referred

to it, shall be final; Provide that an aggrieved party may prefer an appeal to the court of

appeal within thirty days of the receipt by him of such decision, on a question of law"

This section was not complied with by the Petitioner. He is estopped by saying he was not aware

of the inquiry. He was represented by an attorney at Law who had cross-examined the witnesses

at the inquiry. When the decision was made, if the Petitioner had any grievance, he should have

Page 5 of 7

exercised the legal remedies provided in the Act since the Petitioner had not moved at the proper

time. After the order of the inquiry, he cannot seek remedies regarding the inquiry. The argument

regarding the ejectment order made by the Magistrate is another point on which the Petition is

based.

However, there are statutes in which application is made ex-parte, and the Judge delivers an

order prayed for. Whenever the statute states, enforcement orders must be given, as in this case,

the Magistrate must proceed according to the provisions of the statute.

On those grounds, the learned High Court Judge had upheld the Respondent's arguments. I see

no reason to disturb the High Court Judge's order, as discussed above.

Prayer regarding writs is the main point to be discussed. The Petitioner must show what

administrative Act or order is ultra vires or void in Law. Mere praying for a writ is not a ground

to grant a Writ. Duty is cast upon a Judge who issues a writ to be satisfied that there is no other

remedy or option than to issue the Writ. To conclude, one who prays for the Writ must prove it

to Court.

The person or persons had a legal authority to determine the question of affecting the

right.

In exercising his duty, he had acted exceeding the authority given to him, causing damage

to the party seeking a remedy.

The violator is subject to the process of Law.

The above positions were discussed in many cases R v Electricity Commissiners, ex p London

Electricity Joint Commission1 is the most critical case. The Petitioner had not proved what or

which part of the officers' actions was illegal or ultra vires.

As the learned High Court judge had discussed, the Petitioner had not specified against whom a

writ of Mandamus is prayed or what legal right of his had been violated.

In the case of Perera Vs. National Housing Development Authority2 reads as follows:

"On the question of a legal right, it is to be noted that the foundation of Mandamus is the

existence of a legal right. (Napier Ex-parte 1852 18 QB 692) Mandamus is not intended to

create a legal right but to restore a party who has been denied his right to the enjoyment

of such right. A "Mandamus" will lie to any person or authority who is under a duty

(imposed by statute or under a common law) to do a particular act if that person or

authority refrains from doing the Act or refrains for a wrong motive from exercising a

power which is his duty to exercise, the Court will issue a mandamus directing him to do

what he should do (R. Vs. Metropolitan Police Commissioner 1953 AER 717 at page 719."

The Law is that a writ of Mandamus can only be issued to a natural person. In the case of A.C.M.

Hanifa Vs. Chairman Municipal council Nawalapitiya3 reads as follows:

"A mandamus can only issue against a natural person who holds a public office.

Accordingly, in an application for a writ of Mandamus against the chairman of an Urban

Council, the Petitioner must name the individual person against whom the Writ can be

issued".

Many judgments have affirmed that a writ of Mandamus can only be issued against a natural

person. In the case of Martin and Another Vs. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services and

two Others4 is another example in which the courts have upheld this position.

In the Petition dated 22.08.2014 only natural person referred is W.R. Anurasena, who is not a

public officer. All other Respondents are legal personalities established for administrative

purposes. The 4th Respondent is the Attorney General. The 2nd to 4th Respondents are referred to

in their official capacities. This Court cannot consider those positions as natural persons.

For reasons set out above, I affirm the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge of Badulla

dated 30.07.2011.
