The learned District Judge in his judgement has stated that the Counsel for the Defendants had requested Court to disregard that evidence. Therefore, it is the submission of the learned Counsel for the Plaintiffs-Appellants that it may have persuaded the learned District Judge not to consider the aforesaid evidence in favour of the Plaintiffs.

The question that has to be considered is whether their possession was undisturbed and whether they were in exclusive possession or their possession was disturbed by the 1st Plaintiff. The 7th and 8th Defendants cannot establish an undisturbed possession if the 1st Plaintiff also had possessed the corpus along with the 7th and 8th Defendants. The 1st Plaintiff in his evidence had stated that he took the produce of the corpus while the 7th and 8th Defendants were residing in the corpus. On the other hand, the 8th Defendant had stated that the 1st Plaintiff and the other co-owners never possessed the corpus and she possessed the corpus exclusively and took the entire produce. The learned District Judge who had seen and heard the witnesses has preferred to accept the 8th Defendants version and has refused to accept the 1st Plaintiffs version and he was justified in coming to that conclusion. After taking into consideration the infirmities of the evidence of the 1st Plaintiff regarding the plantations in the corpus, the learned District Judge has refused to accept the evidence of the 1st Plaintiff that he possessed the corpus. The 1st Plaintiff in his evidence had stated that he leased out the coconut trees in the corpus. But as the learned District Judge has correctly observed the Plaintiffs had failed to adduce evidence to establish that fact. In any event, the learned District Judge could not have acted on that evidence in view of the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence of the 1st Plaintiff specially in a situation where he had rejected the evidence of the 1st Plaintiff regarding the character of possession of the 7th and 8th Defendants which gives rise to the concept of the indivisibility of the credibility of a witness.",

Therefore, their possession is not permissive user. A right in another person cannot be fairly and naturally inferred from that possession. The rights of the Plaintiffs and the other co-owners cannot be inferred from that possession. The 7th and 8th Defendants had improved the old house which was there without the permission of the Plaintiffs and other co-owners and without their objection. The 7th and 8th Defendants had planted the land and taken out the produce of the existing old plantation without the permission of the Plaintiffs and other co-owners and without their objections. The Plaintiffs and the other co-owners had made no attempt to prevent those actions of the 7th and 8th Defendants and they had not complained to the Police or to the Grama Sevaka of the area against those acts. That shows that the 7th and 8th Defendants had possessed the corpus with the intention of holding the land as owner (animus domini). They had been in possession for more than 10 years and the possession was uninterrupted and undisturbed and it was exclusive possession. The Plaintiffs and the other co-owners of the corpus had not been in possession. Therefore, on the balance of probability of evidence one can come to the conclusion that the 7th and 8th Defendants had established a prescriptive right to lot no. 1 of the corpus.",
