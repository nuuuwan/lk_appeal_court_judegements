MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant matter has been filed to set aside the order dated 15.12.2017

of the High Court of Gampaha. In the instant matter, the first respondent

had been indicted in the High Court under Section 365 of the Penal Code.

The first responded pleaded guilty and the trial had commenced. Upon

the conclusion of the trial, the first respondent had been convicted for

the charge in the indictment and he had been sentenced to ten years RI

with a fine and compensation. Being agreed by the said sentence the

instant application for revision has been filed in 2019.

It is a well-founded principle of law that if a person has a right of appeal

and if that is not exercised the failure to do so has to be explained. It has

been held in the case of Ameen vs. rasheed 3CLW 8, Abrahams CJ

observed that, It has been represented to us on the part the petitioner

that even if we find the order to be appealable, we still have discretion

to act in revision. It has been said in this court often enough that revision

of an appealable order is an exceptional proceeding and in the petition

no reason is given why this method of rectification has been sought

rather than the ordinary method of appeal. I can see no reason why the

petitioner should expect us to exercise our revisionary powers in his favor

when he might have appealed and I would allow the preliminary

objection and dismiss the application with costs.

In the case of Rustom v Hapangama (1978 SLR Vol.2 PAGE No.225) His

lordship justice Ismail stated thus, The trend of authority clearly

indicates that where the revisionary powers of the Court of Appeal are

invoked the practice has been that these powers will be exercised if there

is an alternative remedy available only if the existence of special

Page 4 of 5

circumstances are urged necessitating the indulgence of this court to

exercise these powers in revision. If the existence of special

circumstances does not exist then this court will not exercise its powers

in revision.

In Rasheed Ali vs. Mohamed Ali (1936 6 CLW) Soza J. remarked thus:

The powers of revision conferred on the Court of Appeal are very wide

and the Court has the discretion to exercise them whether an appeal lies

or not or whether an appeal had been taken or not. However, this

discretionary remedy can be invoked only where there are exceptional

circumstances warranting the intervention of the court.

Therefore, in this matter the first respondent has failed to explain as to

why he has not exercised his statutory right but he has had the audacity

to state in the prayer to the petition that he wishes this Court to reduce

his sentence of ten years to seven years. The first respondent

undoubtedly can support his prayer and may be substantiate his claim

with law and facts but he cannot usurp the discretion of court and dictate

to court as to what sentence should be imposed. Therefore, we hold this

prayer to the petition with much disapproval and displeasure.

Furthermore, the impugned conviction has been entered in 2017 and the

instant application has been filed in 2019. Therefore, there is a delay of

two years. It is a well-founded principle that, if a party files a revision

application it has to be filed without delay. The delay has been held to be

fatal. The delay has also not been explained. Delay has been considered

to be a fatal error if it has not been explained to the satisfaction of the

Court, this has been so held by this bench in the case of CA/PHC/APN

Page 5 of 5

78/2021. The same has been held in the case of Ilangakoon v OIC

Eppawala Police Station 2007 1SLR Page 398.

Furthermore the 1st respondent has failed adduce any exceptional

illegality in the sentence or conviction entered by the learned High

Court Judge.

Therefore, in view of the delay being not explained, and the failure to

explain as to why the right of appeal has not been exercised, and the

failure to state any exceptional circumstance which shocks the conscious

of Court, this Court sees no reason to allow the instant application for

revision. As such the instant application is dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
