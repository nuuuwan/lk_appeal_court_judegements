The Petitioner has served as an Assistant Teacher and has retired from public service on

18.05.2021. The Petitioner states that on or around 26.09.2005 she has contracted viral

Page 3 of 8

hepatitis while serving at the Princess of Wales College, Moratuwa, and that during the

same time she was bitten by a serpent upon which she had undergone ayurvedic treatment

until December 2006. The Petitioner submits that she had even undergone a depression

condition which needed treatment for a long period. During the period of her absence in

service, the Petitioner has been served with a letter of vacation of post. As a consequence

to an appeal made by the Petitioner, the Public Service Commission (PSC) by its letter

dated 30.10.2012 (X11) has vacated the said order on vacation of post and she has been

reinstated subject to certain conditions.

The PSC, by virtue of the said order marked X11, has decided to defer two salary

increments of the Petitioner and also to consider the period that she was not in service as

a period of no-pay leave. After such reinstatement in service, the Petitioner has complained

that she was not receiving due salary increments. The Petitioner alleges that her period of

absence from work (27.09.2005 to 29.11.2012) has been considered as a period of no-pay

leave by the 4th Respondent. The Petitioner has submitted another appeal to the PSC based

on the said complaint and the PSC has rejected her appeal by its letter dated 14.09.2017

(X19) based on the grounds that no increment could be earned during a period of no-pay

leave. Subsequently, the Petitioner has made an appeal to the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal (AAT) against the said order of the PSC.

The AAT by its order dated 11.02.2019, marked X20a, has dismissed the Petitioners

said appeal. The Petitioner in the instant application seeks for a writ of Certiorari to quash

the said order of the AAT, marked X20a.

In terms of Article 59(2) of the Constitution of the Republic, the AAT shall have the power

to alter, vary or rescind any order or decision made by the PSC. The Article 61A of the

Constitution stipulates inter alia that subject to the provisions of Article 59 and Article 126,

no court or tribunal shall have power or jurisdiction to inquire into, or pronounce upon or

in any manner call in question any order or decision made by the PSC, a Committee (a

committee appointed by the PSC), or any public officer. In view of those Constitutional

provisions, this Court has already decided that the Court of Appeal shall have no

jurisdiction to inquire into or pronounce or in any manner call in question any order or

decision made by the PSC in pursuance of any power or duty conferred or imposed on

PSC. However, the Writ jurisdiction could be sought against PSC, under circumstances

where the person who made the impugned decision did not have any legal authority to

Page 4 of 8

make such decision (Katugampola vs. Commissioner General of Excise and others

(2003) 3 Sri. L.R. 207).

The AAT was established in terms of Article 59(1) of the Constitution and its powers and

procedures have been further elaborated in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act No.

4 of 2002. The Section 8(2) of the said Act stipulates that a decision made by the Tribunal

shall be final and conclusive and shall not be called in question in any suit or proceedings

in a court of law.

However, it is now settled law that a decision of the AAT on a PSC decision can be

impugned under Article 140 of the Constitution as the AAT is an Appellate Tribunal

constituted in terms of Article 59(1) of the Constitution having the power where

appropriate to alter, vary or rescind any order or decision of the PSC. (See-Ratnayake vs.

Administrative Appeals Tribunal and others (2013) 1 Sri. L.R. 331, Delapolage

Lakmini Delapola vs. Justice Imam and others CA/Writ/263/2013 decided on

26.07.2019 ).

Having considered the jurisdiction of the AAT, now, it is important to take into

consideration the parameters of the jurisdiction of this Court in regard to an order of AAT.

In Kalamazoo Industries Limited vs. Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training

(1998) 1 Sri. L.R. 235, which was an application for judicial review against an award

made by an Industrial Arbitrator. Although, the instant application deals with an order

made by the AAT, I am of the view that the findings of the said judgement which

distinguishes an Appeal and Judicial Review should be followed here as the present

task of this Court is to review an order of AAT. F.N.D. Jayasuriya J. in the said judgement

has held that at p.249;

This court must keep prominently in forefront that it is exercising in this

instance a very limited jurisdiction quite distinct from the exercise of appellate

jurisdiction. Relief by way of certiorari in relation to an award made by an

arbitrator will be forthcoming to quash such an award only if the arbitrator

wholly or in part assumes a jurisdiction which he does not have or exceeds that

which he has or acts contrary to principles of natural justice or pronounces an

award which is eminently irrational or unreasonable or is guilty of an illegality.

The remedy by way of certiorari cannot be made use of to correct errors or to

Page 5 of 8

substitute a correct order for a wrong order and if the arbitrator's award was not

set aside in whole or in part, it had to be allowed to stand unreversed.

It is pertinent to refer to the principles laid down by Prof. H. W. R. Wade on

Administrative Law 12th edition1 at pages 34 to 35 wherein the learned author states:

"Judicial review is radically different from the system of appeals. When hearing an appeal,

the court is concerned with the merits of the decision under appeal. But in judicial review, the

court is concerned with its legality. On appeal, the question is right or wrong. On review, the

question is lawful or unlawful . . . judicial review is a fundamentally different operation.

Instead of substituting its own decision for that of some other body, as happens when an

appeal is allowed, a court, on review, is concerned only with whether the act or order under

attack should be allowed to stand or not. In the circumstances the objective of this court upon

judicial review in this application is to strictly consider whether the whole or part of the award

of the arbitrator is lawful or unlawful. This court ought not to exercise its appellate powers

and jurisdiction when engaged in the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction and judicial review

of an award of an arbitrator. (Emphasis added)

In Reg. vs. Lord Chancellor, Ex p. Maxwell (D.C) (1997) 1 W.L.R. 104 at 109, the

Court has observed that those Courts (which exercise the jurisdiction of judicial review)

are not concerned with the merits of such decisions, but only with the legality of them.

The judgement of Reg. vs. Ministry of Defence, Ex parte Smith (1996) Q.B. 517, 554

has been referred to in the said case in order to emphasize the test in irrationality by

quoting the below mentioned passage of Sir Thomas Bingham M.R.;

The Court may not interfere with the exercise of an administrative discretion on substantive

grounds save where the court is satisfied that the discretion is unreasonable in the sense that

it is beyond the range of responses open to a reasonable decision-maker. But in judging

whether the decision-maker has exceeded this margin of appreciation the human rights

context is important. The more substantial the interference with human rights, the more the

court will require by way of justification before it is satisfied that the decision is reasonable in

the sense outlined above.

In the circumstances, in an application for judicial review against a decision of the AAT,

this Court exercises a limited jurisdiction and it is distinct from the exercise of Appellate

1 I have observed that it is a typographical error. However, the same contents are there in the 6th Edition at pages 36 to 38.

Page 6 of 8

jurisdiction. This Court will review the decision of the AAT under the circumstances

(a) where the members of the AAT who made the impugned decision did not have legal

authority to make such decision or (b) if the AAT has acted contrary to principles of

natural justice or (c) issue an order which is eminently irrational or unreasonable or tainted

with illegality. As I have observed earlier, the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under

Article 140 would be limited to a review of a decision of the AAT and would not extend

to quash the decisions of the PSC or of a Committee or public official to whom the powers

of the PSC have been delegated.

Now, I advert to the order made by the AAT in which the Petitioners appeal has been

duly examined. The AAT has categorically decided that it would not be possible to draw

increments for the period during which the Petitioner has not been in service and such

conclusion was based on the provisions of Section 10:1 and 10:2 of Chapter VIII of the

Establishment Code (E-Code). The said Sections 10:1 & 10:2 reads;

Section 10:1 An officer is not entitled to draw an increment as of right. He is

required to earn it by the efficient and diligent discharge of his duties and by serving

the incremental period in full (see subsection 10:9). A certificate to that effect

should be signed by the appropriate authority before an increment is paid.

(Emphasis added)

Section 10:2 If such a certificate cannot be granted in respect of any officer, his

increment is disallowed. The disallowance may take one of the following forms;

Suspension, Reduction, Stoppage, Deferment of that increment.

The literal sense of the said section 10:1 is that no increment can be earned unless (i) the

officer concerned has efficiently and diligently discharged of his duties and (ii) by serving

the incremental period in full.

In addition to the provisions of the above Sections 10:1 and 10:2, the AAT has taken into

consideration the provisions of Section 37:2 of Chapter XLVIII of the E-Code which deals

with Appeals against notice of vacation of post. In view of the said Section 37:2, the

Disciplinary Authority may order the reinstatement of the relevant officer based on

acceptable reasons after imposing punishment for not reporting to duty without

permission.

Page 7 of 8

The Petitioners main contention is that the relevant authority without giving due effect to

the provisions of Section 10:9:1 of the E-Code has overlooked the reason for granting no-

pay leave. In other words, the Petitioners argument is that she had been granted no-pay

leave due to her illness and that aspect has not been taken into consideration by the

relevant authority when denying her increments for the period of no-pay leave. The said

Section 10:9:1 reads;

Section 10:9:1- If an officer is on no-pay for over a period of 6 months, that period

of leave in excess of 6 months will not be reckoned as service for increments unless

such leave is granted for reasons outside the officers control (e.g. illness) or has

been granted at the instance of the Government. His increment would thereby be

deferred by a period equal to the period by which the no-pay leaves exceeds 6

months. (Emphasis added)

In my view, according to the said Section 10:9:1, there should be reasonable evidence

which are acceptable in law to justify that even a portion of the no-pay leave granted to

the Petitioner was due to her illness. The AAT has observed that the Petitioner had failed

to submit any documentary proof to establish her medical depression condition (during

the years 2005 to 2011) until the submission of medical certificate marked X5i issued by

a Consultant Psychiatrist of the District Hospital Unawatuna on 22.08.2011. Accordingly,

the AAT has concluded that it would be difficult to accept the said medical certificate

submitted by the Petitioner to cover a period of more than three years. The Petitioner has

failed to substantiate her illness by producing medical proof even for the period after 2008,

the year from which she claims that the treatment for medical condition of depression has

commenced. It is also pertinent to observe that the Petitioner has reported back to work

after a long no-pay leave on 30.11.2012.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that no increments can be drawn by an officer for

the period he/she was on no-pay leave. However, the relevant authorities should be duly

satisfied, with adequate evidence, that the no-pay leave is granted for reasons outside the

relevant officers control, such as an occurrence of an illness, for the purpose of reckoning

such no-pay leave period as service of increments, in terms of the said Section 10:9:1. It is

to be noted that the PSC has observed in its order X19 that the granting of no-pay leave

to the Petitioner was not due to the reasons outside the control of the Petitioner whereas

the AAT has observed that the Petitioner has failed to submit adequate supporting

documents to establish her alleged illness.

Page 8 of 8

In light of the foregoing, I take the view that the order of the AAT is not eminently

irrational or unreasonable or guilty of illegality. Hence, I arrive at the conclusion, based

on the arguability principles that should be adopted in respect of matters relating to

issuance of notice in a judicial review application, that there is no arguable case or a prima

facie case for this Court to issue formal notice on the Respondents in this application.

Therefore, I proceed to refuse this application.
