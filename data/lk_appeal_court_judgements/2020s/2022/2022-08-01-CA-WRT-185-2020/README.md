Tea Factory and/or Harangalla Tea Factory owned and/or controlled

and/or more of the sand factories have failed to obtain and/or

submit HACCP certification,

The Petitioners state that on or around 02.06.2020 a lorry hired by the

Petitioners to carry finished goods (tea) from the Petitioners factories to

Colombo for auction with Lanka Commodity Brokers Limited was taken

into custody by the Officers of the Yatiyantota Police Station on the

suspicion that the said consignment contained refuse tea. Subsequently,

the Police informed this incident to the Tea Commissioner (4th Respondent)

and summoned Mr. Ashok Lal, a Director of the 5th Petitioner Company

(Petitioner in case No. CA/Writ/184/20) to the Police Station on the

following day. Both the said Mr. Ashok Lal and the Officers of the 1st

Respondent presented as required by the Police on 03.06.2020. After the

visual examination the Officers of the 1st Respondent, Sri Lanka Tea Board

(SLTB) determined that the teas found in the lorry was not refuse tea but

made tea, and therefore on that basis they released the consignment of tea

to Mr. Ashok Lal. The Officers of the 1st Respondent, however, decided to

take three samples of the tea in the presence of the Police Officers and Mr.

Ashok Lal for further testing. Mr. Ashok Lal and the Officers of the Police

was requested to sign on the sealed sample. These samples were sent to

Page 5 of 13

the 1st Respondents head office for two types of testing i.e., tasting test (to

be examined and tested by the Tea Tasting Unit of the SLTB) and laboratory

test (to be examined and tested by the Analytical Laboratory of the SLTB).

Both tasting and laboratory test results indicated that the samples were

found to be suspected of sugar and other contaminations (the maximum

possible levels of sugar in the mid elevation 25mg/g. However, according

to the test results the Petitioners tea samples exceed the mid elevation

level). In the interim, on the advice of the Petitioners, another tea sample

that had been catalogued by the Petitioners Broker Lanka Commodity

Brokers was also tested. This result too indicated that the tea was

contaminated with sugar. In this matrix, the 4th Respondent took necessary

steps to suspend the registration of the Petitioner. Accordingly, the 4th

Respondent issued a letter marked P6 dated 10.07.2020 informs the 5th

Petitioner that as the 5th Petitioner company exceeded the maximum

possible levels of sugar for black tea in the mid elevation and accordingly

the factory is in violation of the Circular No. TC/CIR(204)-01 dated

20.05.202 the registration of the 5th Petitioner company is suspended. The

4th Respondent has further written to the licensed commodity Brokers

indicating that the 5th Petitioners registration has been suspended with

immediate effect and therefore to refrain from the sale of teas made by the

5th Petitioner until further notice.

The Petitioners sought a Writ of Prohibition to restraint the Respondents to

cancel and/or suspend the registration of the Petitioners companies, inter

alia, on the following grounds:

(a) The Petitioners are unaware as to how the Chain of custody of the

samples taken were maintained. Therefore, the Petitioner stances

that the samples tested were not of the Petitioner.

(b) Although the purported cancellation or suspension of the

registration is on the ground that the Petitioners tea had exceeded

the maximum possible levels of sugar for black tea in mid elevation,

this is not a ground to cancel/suspend the registration in terms of

law. Therefore, the Respondents conducts were ultra vires.

Page 6 of 13

(c) The Respondents have failed to afford a proper hearing (i.e., inquiry)

before the alleged suspension (the total absence of natural justice)

It is not disputed that the reference samples obtained on 03.06.2020 at the

Yatiyantota Police Station were given to all parties including the 5th

Petitioner and the Police. These samples were taken into SLTB custody for

testing under seal. The sealed packages were signed by the SLTB Officers

and Mr. Ashok Lal and the same were sent to the relevant testing units

under secret codes to preserve confidentiality with regard to the identity

and ownership of the same. In addition to these, the SLTB Officers have re-

drawn samples from the catalogued tea in the presence of the Brokers at

their warehouse. At the end, all three samples tested positive for sugar

contamination. However, the Petitioner while impeaching the testing

results filed by the Respondents submits, inter alia that,

(a) The samples were not opened in the presence of the Petitioner.

(b) The laboratory does not state that it opened a sealed envelope which

contained the seals of some persons.

(c) The samples tested in were not the samples collected by the Police,

and the Respondents have perpetrated a serious fraud on the Court.

(d) With regard to the test results from samples supposedly taken from

the Brokers, there has been no process followed. There is no seal. There is

no envelop. There is no secret code.

(e) There are serious discrepancies in the secret codes that were given

to the sample collected at the Police station.

The Respondents, in contrast to the above contentions of the Petitioner,

submitted that the sample drawn at the Police Station was carefully drawn

in the presence of Mr. Ashok Lal, Director of the Petitioner Company and

the second sample was drawn in the presence of the Petitioners accredited

Broker who officially responsible for selling the Petitioners tea. They further

submitted that the 4th Respondent by P4 informed the Petitioner of the

sequence of events related to sampling of the Petitioners catalogued tea

Page 7 of 13

and requested the Petitioner to be present for an inquiry on 24.07.2020 to

state their case with respect to the allegations of contamination. The

Respondents further contended that since a representative of the Petitioner

had given a sample, if at all they had any suspicion on the chain of custody,

the Petitioner could have made a request to the 4th Respondent to re-test

the sample handed over to the Petitioner, and if such request was made,

the test could have been done in the presence of the SLTB Officers.

However, the Petitioner has never made such a request. Hence, the

Respondents took the position that the Petitioner not making for such

request itself clearly establishes the fact that the Petitioner did not have

any issues with regard to the chain of custody, and that it was merely

fabricated or afterthought for the purpose of this instant application.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner sought to argue that the

suspension of registration of any tea factory under section 8(2) of the Tea

Control Act, No. 39 of 1974 must be on the basis that the building,

equipment or manner of operation of the factory is not of a standard

conducive to the manufacture of good tea. Thus, he took the position that

there is no question or allegation about the building or equipment of the

Petitioners factories. The only allegation is that sugar has been added at

some point to the tea. Therefore, the addition of sugar is not a matter that

comes within section 8(2) of the Act.

The learned Additional Solicitor General for Respondents, per contra,

submitted that the maximum possible levels sugar in tea is a very serious

issue and such default is not trivial by any means. It directly impacts the

quality and the brand name of Ceylon tea. Accordingly, the learned

Additional Solicitor General for the Respondents sought to argue that the

suspension of the Petitioners tea factories had been made in terms of

section 8(2)(a) as the Commissioner was satisfied that the manner of

operation of any tea factory is not of a standard conducive to the

manufacture of made tea of good quality. They further argued that

according to section 8(2)(a) there could be several acts not of a standard

conducive to the manufacture of the made tea of good quality and all such

Page 8 of 13

acts could not be listed in the section. Therefore, when a wide phrase as

such is included in law, it is understood by a reasonable man that,

manufacturing contaminated tea would certainly be captured in the frame

of not of a standard conducive to the manufacture of tea of good quality.

Section 8(2) of the said Act (as amended by Act No. 3 of 1993) reads thus:

Where the Controller is satisfied, after such inquiry as he may deem

necessary:

(a) that the building, or equipment, or manner of operation, of

any tea factory is not of a standard conducive to the

manufacture of made tea of good quality; or

(b) that the owner of a tea factory has paid for green tea leaf bought

by him for manufacture at such factory a price lower than the

reasonable price payable as determined by the Controller having

regard to the price fetched for made tea manufactured at that

factory; or

(c) that the owner of a tea factory has delayed payment of the

reasonable price, referred to in paragraph (b) for green tea leaf

bought by him for manufacture at that factory,

the Controller may suspend or cancel where necessary, the

registration of such tea factory.

To my mind, there is no ambiguity in this section. Where the Controller is

fairly satisfied that the building, or equipment, or manner of operation of

any tea factory is not of a standard conducive to the manufacture of made

tea of good quality may suspend or cancel the registration of such tea

factory if necessary. This section provides every factory manufacturing of

made tea needs to maintain their building, equipment and modes of

operation in a standard conducive to the manufacture of tea of good quality.

The phrase manner of operation, in my view, includes methods of

manufacturing tea.

Page 9 of 13

Furthermore, section 8(2) cannot be interpretated in isolation. There are

several regulations have been created by the competent authorities i.e.,

SLTB. As submitted by the learned Additional Solicitor General for the

Respondents Directive No: RTM/01/2005/11/01 (R2 Directions given

under section 8(2) of the Tea Control, Act No. 51 of 957 as amended to

preserve the manufactures of made tea made by the Tea Commissioner of

the SLTB) is crucial in this regard. Clause 2, 3, and 4 of the R2 stipulates

as to how the naturalness of the made tea would be harmed and specifically

states that if any act to harm the naturalness of made tea is revealed, the

Tea Commissioner shall take steps to suspend or cancel the license. Clause

1 and 4 of the R2 read thus:

1. Section 8(2) of the Tea Control Act No. 51 of 1957 as amended

requires that the manner of operation (the tea manufacturing

process) of a tea factory should be conducive to the manufacture of

made tea of good quality. Tea is a natural drink derived from the

tea plant (Camellia sinensis). Accordingly, the manner of operation

of a tea factory should guarantee the preservation of the

naturalness of made tea.

4. Accordingly, in order to preserve naturalness of made tea, by virtue

of the powers vested in me by Section 8(2) of the Tea Control Act

No. 51 of 1957 as amended, you are hereby directed to;

(i) Refrain from making any attempts to artificially blacken tea.

(ii) Refrain from storing any substance that could be used to

artificially blacken tea within the tea factory or its premises.

These substances include inter alia substances that are

purported to be natural, such as commercially available

enzymes.

(Emphasizes added)

Furthermore, in recent times, it is evident that further to satisfy the

customers sensory needs and earn unreasonable profits, (high elevation of

Page 10 of 13

prescribed level of) sugar has been allegedly added to tea in the

manufacturing process to improve the lustrousness and taste of tea and

simultaneously achieve the purpose of weight gains.1 In Sri Lanka too, it is

reported that some enterprises make illegal profits by adding sugar and

glucose syrup to improve the taste, tighten the leaf strip and reduce costs

in roasted green tea2.

The Petitioners also sought to question the suspension of their certificate

on the footing that the Respondents have failed to afford a proper inquiry

before the alleged suspension. The learned Additional Solicitor General for

the Respondents, per contra, sought to argue that any tea factory whose

tea had been found to be contaminated be suspended with immediate

effect, pending investigation. The learned Additional Solicitor General

further contended that immediate suspension of the registration of the tea

factory is the only mechanism to prevent contaminated tea being sold

under the brand of Ceylon Tea. The reason for such is that if such

contaminated tea is sold in the international market, it will have an impact

on the quality of Ceylon Tea and that well reputed brand name which

prevailed over decades would be tarnished and thereby the demand for

Ceylon Tea will drastically reduce.

I do agree with the contention of the learned Additional Solicitor General

for the Respondents that an immediate suspension of the registration of

the tea factory is the only mechanism to prevent contaminated tea being

sold under the brand of Ceylon Tea.

Where an Act or the statutory rules framed thereunder left an action

dependent upon the opinion of the authority concerned, by some such

expression as is satisfied or is of the opinion or if it has reason to believe

or if it considered necessary, in my view, the opinion of the authority is

1 Hui Wang et al., Simultaneous determination of fructose, glucose and sucrose by solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and its application to source and adulteration analysis of sucrose in tea (2021), Journal of Food Composition and Analysis, Volume 96, March 2021, 103730. 2 https://www.ft.lk/Business/Stop-adding-sugar-to-tea-during-production-or-face-consequences-Navin-warns-industry/34-675933

Page 11 of 13

conclusive, where (a) if the authority acted bona fide and (d) if the authority

did not proceed on a fundamental misconception of the law and the matter

in regard to which the opinion had to be formed. However, the action based

on the subjective opinion or satisfaction, can judicially be reviewed first to

find out the existence of the facts or circumstances on the basis of which

the authority is alleged to have formed the opinion. As it was held in

Amarendra Kumar Pandey v. Union of India and Others [Civil Appeal

Nos. 11473-11474 of 2018, Supreme Court of India, SC Minutes of

14.07.2022] ordinarily the Court should not inquire into the correctness

or otherwise of the facts found except in a case where it is alleged that the

facts which have been found existing were not supported by any evidence

at all or that the finding in regard to circumstances or material is so

perverse that no reasonable man would say that the facts and

circumstances exist.

The Courts will not readily defer to the conclusiveness of the authoritys

opinion as to the existence of matter of law or fact upon which the validity

of the exercise of the power is predicated. However, as Lord Denning

correctly pointed out in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Head (1959)

AC 83, where there are no reasonable grounds for the formation of the

authoritys opinion, judicial review in such a case is permissible. Thus, the

doctrine of reasonableness may be invoked.

In the case in hand, the Tea Commissioner (4th Respondent) has informed

the Petitioner (vide P6) that the registration of the 5th Petitioner Company

has been suspended with immediate effect. The reasons for such

suspension are given in P6 that at the investigation carried out by the SLTB

it was revealed that made tea manufactured at their factory had exceeded

the maximum possible levels of sugar for black tea in the mid elevation and

accordingly the factory is in violation of the direction issued by the Tea

Commissioner under section 8(2) of the Tea Control Act. The 4th

Respondent also informed the 5th Petitioner the sequence of events related

to the sampling of theirs catalogued tea and requested the Petitioners to be

present for an inquiry on 24.07.2020 to state his case with respect to the

Page 12 of 13

alleged contamination. However, the 5th Petitioner by its letter dated

23.07.2020 had responded requesting the Respondent to lift the

suspension and cancel the inquiry. Moreover, section 8(2) of Act specifically

provides that where the Controller is satisfied, after such inquiry as he may

deem necessary, he may issue the direction specified in the section. The

section never states after such inquiry as he shall deem necessary.3

Hence, as submitted by the learned Additional Solicitor General for the

Respondents that in order to maintain the quality of Ceylon Tea and its

brand value, it is vital to stop contaminated tea from reaching the global

market and therefore, rigorous measures should be adapted with to ensure

that it is only the highest quality of tea that would reach the global market.

In my view, the 4th Respondent authority acted bona fide, and the

Petitioners failed to show that the authority did not proceed on a

fundamental misconception of the law and the matter in regard to which

the alleged decision had to be formed. According to me, the Commissioner

has adopted a fair procedure although there may not be hearing of the kind

normally required by natural justice.

The learned Additional Solicitor General for the Respondents also invited

this Court to consider the fact that the Petitioners have a clear alternative

remedy against the suspension of the registration envisaged in P6 under

section 37(1)(e) of the Tea Control Act.

Section 37(1)(e) of the Tea Control Act provides thus:

Any person aggrieved

by the decision of the Controller under subsection (2) of section 8 of the

cancellation of the registration of any registered tea factory,

may, within twenty-eight days after the communication of such

decision or cancellation to such person, appeal in writing from such

decision or cancellation to the Minister.

3 For example, see section 26 of the Vaccination Act (Act No. V of 1880) of Bangladesh

Page 13 of 13

Hence, as submitted by the Respondents, as like in CA/Writ/184/20, the

Petitioners in this case too, without exhausting the statutory right of appeal

had sought this Courts permission by way of Writ application under Article

140 of the Constitution.

It is trite law that Writ remedy is a discretionary remedy and will not be

granted unless the plaintiff has exhausted the other remedies reasonably

available and equally appropriate. Vide Linus Silva v. The University

Council of the Vidyodaya University (per T.S. Fernando, J.) (1961) 64

NLR 104 and Chandraseana v. Abeysuriya [CA/Writ/457/19, Court

Appeal Minutes of 16.06.2022].

For the foregoing reasons, this Court is of the view that the application of

the Petitioners is liable to be dismissed. Accordingly, I dismiss the

application without costs.

Application dismissed.
