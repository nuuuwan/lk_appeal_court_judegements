Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner was elected a member of the Kadawath Sathara and Gangawata Korale

Pradeshiya Sabha ('Pradeshiya Sabha') in the Kandy District consequent to the Local

Government Elections held in 2018 and was elected as the Chairman of the said

Pradeshiya Sabha by its Members. The Petitioner was required to submit a budget for the

Page 6 of 10

succeeding year i.e., year 2022 (budget), in terms of the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act No. 15

of 1987, as amended (the Act). The issue that emerges in this application revolves around

the said budget.

Facts in this case are very much similar to the case of Hanguranketha Pradeshiya Sabha

bearing no. CA Writ 08/2022 in which the Governor of the Central Province declared that

the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha is considered to have resigned from the post of

Chairman due to failure to pass the budget prepared by the said Chairman.

The learned Counsel who represented several Respondents in this case, taking the same

argument as in other connected cases asserted that the questions relating to this application

have already been resolved by His Lordship Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere with the

agreement of the His Lordship Justice Mayadunne Corea in four separate cases of this

Court. i.e., CA Writ 24/2021, CA Writ 51/2021, CA Writ 57/2021 and CA Writ

61/2021. Accordingly, the relevant Respondents moved that this application be dismissed

in limine.

In the circumstances, it is necessary in this case also, to ascertain whether the Petitioner

has submitted a case which is suitable for full investigation and a hearing after issuing

notice on all the Respondents. In the backdrop of the above orders made by this Court and

upon the circumstances, the Court should be satisfied that there is a prima facie case that

ought to be resolved after full argument.

The Petitioner on 20.07.2021 requested the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha ('Members')

to attend a meeting to discuss the draft budget. Later, he requested the Members to submit

their views and suggestions in that regard in writing. Many proposals were submitted and

all of them were incorporated to the proposed budget. Consequently, Special Meeting was

held on 02.12.2021 at which the Petitioner tabled the budget. The Petitioner agreeing with

three proposals made by certain Members allowed the Members of the Pradeshiya Sabha

to adopt them after vote. Two of the three proposals were passed by majority and those

were incorporated in to the budget. On the basis that no objections were made against the

budget, the Petitioner proceeded to declare the budget as adopted by the Members.

Subsequently, a division was requested on the budget. The Petitioner expressing that the

division would not affect the budget, as the Members had accepted all proposed

amendments and however, allowed a vote to take place. As a result, 12 members voted

Page 7 of 10

against and 1 member voted for the budget and 7 members did not vote. The 2nd

Respondent on 20.12.2021 informed the Petitioner to act in accordance with section 168

and 169 of the Act as the Petitioner failed to get the budget passed by the Council.

The 1st Respondent based on the failure of the Petitioner to get the budget passed by a

majority vote has issued the Gazette Notification No. 2261/3 dated 03.01.2022 marked

P-1 declaring that the Petitioner is considered to have resigned from the post of Chairman

with effect from 31.12.2021 and the post of Chairman is considered to be vacant since that

date, due to failure to pass the budget prepared by the Petitioner under section 168 and the

proviso to section 169 of the Act and also on non-compliance with the said section 169.

The 2nd Respondent on 18.01.2022 summoned a meeting to appoint a new Chairman.

Subsequently, the 7th respondent was elected and appointed as the new Chairman.

The budget which was submitted to Council on 02.12.2021 by the Petitioner was for the

year 2022 and that was for a period after two years since the commencement of the term

of office of the Kadawath Sathara and Gangawata Korale Pradeshiya Sabha. The initial

question which arises in this application is whether the Petitioner is entitled to declare the

budget which was defeated by a majority as a duly adopted budget under section 169 of

the Act due to the alleged reason that he had accepted the amendments proposed. The

other question which arises is whether the Petitioner is deemed to have resigned from the

office of Chairman as he failed to re-submit the budget for a vote after it was defeated.

I have already dealt with and determined similar questions relating to this application in;

a) Madampage Nanda Wijeratne Silva vs. Marshal of the Airforce Roshan

Goonetileke Governor-Western Province & others (CA Writ 649/2021, decided

on 28.02.2022)

b) Kasudeen Mohomed Nihar vs. Anuradha Yahampath Governor- Eastern

Province & others (CA Writ 12/2022, decided on 28.02.2022)

c) J. Thilekeratne vs. Hon. M. Herath, Governor-North Central Province & others

(CA Writ 31/2022, decided on 28.02.2022)

I have extensively considered the submissions made on behalf of the Petitioner as well as

the submissions on behalf of the Respondents, which are identical to the viewpoint taken

by the Respondents in all above three cases. I hold that the reasoning given by me to arrive

Page 8 of 10

at the conclusion in above three cases are applicable in relation to the questions in the

instance application also.

My findings in the above three cases were mainly based on the precedent established by

His Lordship Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere with the agreement of His Lordship Justice

Mayadunne Corea in the below mentioned cases;

a) Wellawattage Sarath Peiris vs. Katunayake Seeduwa Urban Council, Seeduwa

& others (CA Writ 24/2021, decided on 10.06.2021),

b) Manodara Aacharige Chaminda Sugath, Chairman vs. Anuradha Yahampath,

Governor, Eastern Province & others (CA Writ 51/2021, decided on

10.06.2021).

c) H.M. Lalantha Sumith Seneviratne vs. Pradeshiya Sabhawa of Padiyathalawa

& others (CA Writ 57/2021, decided on 10.06.2021)

d) A.P. Ranasinghe Bandara, Chairman vs. Anuradha Yahampath, Governor of

Eastern Province & others (CA Writ 61/2021, decided on 10.06.2021).

In my order in CA/Writ/31/2021, I have summarized the precedent in the above four

cases as follows;

i. In terms of section 168 (2) of the Act, the budget shall be passed by the Council.

ii. However, in terms of section 169 of the Act, the budget submitted by the Chairman

during the first two years of the Council shall be considered as the duly adopted

budget, by operation of law, even though the said budget has not been passed by a

majority vote. Moreover, taking a vote even during the first two years is essential.

iii. After the first two years of the Council, the budget at the first submission or at the

re-submission should be passed by majority votes of the Council.

iv. It is a mandatory duty of the Chairman to submit the annual budget and if the

budget is defeated at the first submission, the Chairman must re-submit the budget,

for a vote by the Members of the Council.

v. In the event the budget is defeated any time after the first two years and as a result,

if the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha;

a) fails to re-submit the budget and/or

b) fails to get it passed upon re-submission to the Council,

Page 9 of 10

the relevant Chairman is deemed to have vacated his post in terms of the proviso

to section 169.

vi. Even if the Chairman accepts the amendments, modifications, additions to the

budget or to the supplementary budget, the Chairman is subjected to above cardinal

requirements.

Additionally, it is important to reiterate the following passage in my order dated

28.02.2022 in CA Writ 31/2022;

Moreover, the rationale of the decision of the Court in all the above cases in addition to the

provision of the said sections 168 & 169 is based on section 14 (1) of the Act. I also have

observed in my order in CA Writ 649/2021, the deeming provisions of section 169 of the Act

should be carefully interpreted in line with the basic principles of Democracy and Good

Governance without undermining the consent or the division of the Members of the

Pradeshiya Sabha.

The Petitioner has prayed for in the prayer of the Petition inter alia for a mandate in the

nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the Gazette Notification bearing No.2261/3 dated

03.01.2022 marked P-1 issued by the 1st Respondent and the decision of the 2nd

Respondent declaring the appointment and election of the 7th Respondent as the new

Chairman. The 1st Respondent by the said Gazette Notification P-1 has declared that the

Petitioner is deemed to have resigned from the post of Chairman as the budget submitted

by the said Petitioner has not been passed in terms of section 168 of the Act and that the

Petitioner has failed to act in terms of the proviso to section 169 of the Act.

On a careful consideration of the whole matter and in light of the reasoning given in my

above orders (CA Writ 649/2021, CA Writ 12/2022, Writ 31/2022 & CA Writ 32/2022)

& also in view of the legal analysis established in the cases bearing Nos. CA Writ 24/2021,

CA Writ 51/2021, CA Writ 57/2021 and CA Writ 61/2021, I take the view that the 1st

Respondent Governor has given due effect to the provisions of sections 14, 168 and 169

of the Act and lawfully decided that the Petitioner has deemed to have resigned from the

office of Chairman.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the questions raised by the Petitioner in the

instant application have already been resolved in the aforesaid orders of this Court.

Page 10 of 10

Therefore, based on the arguability principles that should be adopted in respect of matters

relating to issuance of notice in a juridical review application, I arrive at the conclusion

that there is no arguable case or a prima facie case for this Court to issue formal notice on

the Respondents in this application. Therefore, I proceed to refuse this application.
