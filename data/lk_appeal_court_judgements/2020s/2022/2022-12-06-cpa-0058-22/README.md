Before: Menaka Wijesundera J.

Neil Iddawala J.

Counsel: Saranga Bandara for the Petitioner.

Ridma Kuruwita, SC for the State.

Argued on: 09.11.2022

Decided on: 06.12.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to set aside the order dated 29.3.22

of the High Court of Galle in which bail has been refused to the suspect

namely Samarage Damayanthi Ashoka.

The above-named suspect had been arrested on 18.3.2021 for being in

possession of 1.85 grams of heroin which the Government Analyst had

confirmed, and the Counsel for the Suspect stated that the production had

been sent for analysis after six months and until then the production had

been in police custody.

The Counsel appearing for the Respondent objected to the application on

the basis that the Suspect had one previous conviction of a similar nature

and one pending case and while on bail for the said offence the instant

offence had been committed.

Upon consideration of the submissions of both sides, the law pertaining to

the instant application is that as the Suspect had been taken in to custody

and produced under the provisions of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Act and according to the latest amendment to the act no 41-22

considering the period in remand and the quantity identified by the

Government Analyst, we direct the learned High Court Judge to enlarge the

above-named suspect on suitable conditions of bail.

As such the instant application for revision is allowed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Neil Iddawala J.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
