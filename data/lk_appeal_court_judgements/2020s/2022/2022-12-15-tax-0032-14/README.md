D.N. Samarakoon, J

The relevant part of the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission is as

reproduced below,

In the appeal made by the appellant, the matter was canvassed only

the non deductibility of Lease Rentals and Repair Expenses. At the

hearing of the appeal before the Respondent as repair expenses were

allowed, the only issue to be decided relates to the deductibility of lease

rentals in relation to vehicles used for travelling purposes which amounted

as Rs. 9,653,695/-. The total tax liability of the appellant amounted to Rs.

6,850,024/-. The penalty referred in section 26(2) of the Inland Revenue

Act which is clear that any rental or annual payment paid in respect of

vehicles which are used for travelling not allowed to deductible as an

expense.

We agree with the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue/Respondent

and the submission made by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

that section 25(k)(1) section 26(2) of the Act No. 10 of 2006 should be read

together.

The appellant has requested to state a case to this Court on the questions

reproduced below,

3 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

(1) Is the amount of Rs. 9,653,695/- paid by the appellant to the employees for

the use of the vehicles of the employees for the purposes of the business of

the appellant, deductible in terms of section 25(1)(k) of the Inland Revenue

Act in the computation of the profits of the appellant for the year of

assessment 2008/2009, notwithstanding any prohibition in section 26(2)

of the same Act?

(2) Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law in assuming that its conclusion

that section 25(1)(k) and 26(2) should be read together provides a sufficient

basis for the purpose of determining the issue raised in this appeal on

behalf of the appellant, namely, that the expenditure especially provided for

in section 25(1)(k) which is a special provision should be deducted

notwithstanding any prohibition in Section 26(2)?

(3) Did the Tax Appeals Commission fail to properly examine and or apply and

or appreciate the facts and the law relevant to this matter?

In respect of the Question No. (1), the appellant submits that the TAC never

decided whether the expense was deductible under section 25(1)(k) because

before the TAC, it was never disputed by the respondent that the expense was

deductible under section 25(1)(k) and the only argument of the Respondent was

that the expense was not deductible due to section 26(2).

In respect of Question No. (2) the appellant submits that the issue in the appeal

before the TAC was whether an expenditure especially provided for under section

25(1)(k) which is a special provision should be deducted notwithstanding any

prohibition under section 26(2).

Hence, if briefly stated, the Questions are,

(i) Whether the section 25(1)(k) provides for a Special Deduction?

(ii) Whether the limitation in section 26(2) does not prohibit the deduction

of Special Deductions?

(iii) In the alternative, what is the result of the application of section 25(1)(k)

with section 26(2)?

Section 25(1)(k) reads,

CHAPTER IV

ASCERTAINMENT OF PROFITS OR INCOME

Deductions allowed

in ascertaining

profits and income.

25.

(1) Subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and

(4), there shall be deducted for the purpose of

ascertaining the profits or income of any person

from any source, all outgoings and expenses

incurred by such person in the production thereof,

including

K- the actual expenses incurred by such person or any other person in his

employment in travelling within Sri Lanka in connection with the trade,

business, profession or vocation in the first mentioned person:

Provided that no deduction under the preceding provisions of this paragraph

shall be allowed to any person-

(i) in respect of expenses incurred in relation to a vehicle used partly for

the purposes of his trade, business, profession or vocation and partly

for the domestic or private purposes of an executive officer being

employed by him or a non-executive director of such organization,

unless the value of the benefit as specified under the proviso to

paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of section 4 of this Act, has been

included in the remuneration of such officer, for the purposes of

deduction of income tax under Chapter XIV of this Act, where such

benefit is not exempt under paragraph (s) of subsection (1) of

section 8 of this Act;

5 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

(ii) in respect of expenses incurred in relation to a vehicle, where more than

one vehicle is provided to any employee of such person or to any non-

executive director or to any other individual who is not an employee,

but rendering services in the trade, business, profession or vocation,

carried on by such person, if such vehicle is not the first vehicle

provided to such employee or non-executive director or such other

individual, as the case may be;

(iii) in respect of expenses incurred in relation to a vehicle where such

vehicle is provided to any other person who is not an employee of such

person and who does not render any services to the trade, business,

profession or vocation carried on by such person;

(iv) in respect of expenses incurred in relation to the reimbursement of any

expenditure on a vehicle belonging to an employee of such person who

has been allowed by the employer to claim such expenses, unless the

value of benefit of using such vehicle for non business purposes by

such employee as determined by the Commissioner-General, has been

included in the remuneration of such employee for the purposes of

deduction of income tax under Chapter XIV, or in the opinion of the

Commissioner-General such amount that is reimbursed represents

only expenses on allowable travelling expenses in relation to the trade,

business, profession or vocation carried on by such employer; and

For the purposes of sub paragraphs (i),(ii),(iii) and this sub

paragraph, expenses incurred shall not include any lease rental

or other rental payments in respect of such vehicle or the cost of

acquisition or the cost of financing of the acquisition of such

vehicle; and

(v) in respect of any expenses incurred by such person by reason of any

travelling done by any other person in his employment between the

6 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

residence of such other person and his place of employment or vice

versa.

The paragraph in bold letters after sub paragraph (iv) was amended in 2007

and 2008.

By Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 10 of 2007 which came into existence

with effect from 01.04.2007, the said paragraph in bold letters after sub

paragraph (iv) was removed.

The said Amendment introduced the paragraph reproduced below, at the end of

the Proviso to section 25(1)(k):

For the purpose of this proviso, expenses incurred, shall include any

lease rental or other payment in respect of such vehicle or the cost of

acquisition of such vehicle.

The appellant submits that the purpose of this amendment was to include rental

expenses in sub paragraphs (i) to (iv) in the Proviso to Section 25(1)(k).

Section 25(1)(k) was once again amended by (Amendment) Act No. 09 of 2008,

with effect from 29.02.2008.

It removed the words reproduced below from the Proviso in section 25(1)(k),

For the purpose of this proviso, expenses incurred, shall include any

lease rental or other payment in respect of such vehicle or the cost of

acquisition of such vehicle.

Hence prior to 01.04.2007 lease rentals could not be deducted. From 01.04.2007

to 29.02.2008, lease rentals could be deducted. After 29.02.2008, lease rentals

could not be deducted.

However, what the appellant intends to show by the introduction of these

amendments is that deductions could be made under section 25(1)(k) even in the

existence of section 26(2).

7 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

In Ogilvy Action (Pvt) Ltd., vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (C.

A. Tax 16/2013, dated 12.11.2021) another division of this Court, expressing

its view on these amendments said,

[89] By the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 9 of 2008, which came

into operation on 24.02.2008, the above-mentioned paragraph (v) of

section 25 (1) (k) was repealed, containing the word lease rental or other

rental in the said proviso. The effect of repealing rental or other rental

payment from the said proviso was to obliterate rental from the proviso as

if it had never existed. The legislature appears to have removed rental or

other rental payment in respect of such vehicle or the cost of acquisition

of such vehicle to avoid any conflict with Section 26 (2) so that rental or

annual payment in respect of any vehicle referred to in paragraphs (a) and

(b) of Section 26 (2) will only be governed by Section 26 (2).

The appellant submits at paragraph 145 of its Written Submissions dated

17.11.2021 that, neither the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue nor the

Tax Appeals Commission disputed that sums paid to employees were included

in their remuneration and PAYE tax was paid.

It is further submitted, that, sums paid to employees were included in their

remuneration for PAYE which tax was deducted and remitted by the appellant

and the expense was a travelling expense incurred in the production of income.

Hence, the expense was deductible under section 25(1)(k).

In Ogilvy Action (Pvt) Ltd., vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (C.

A. Tax 16/2013, dated 12.11.2021) the said division of this Court said with

regard to section 25 and 26,

[51] Now, the question is, if all deductible outgoings and expenses in

Section 25 (1) are subject to the limitations set out in Section 26 as claimed

by the Respondent, why did the legislature include several catalogues of

other deductions in several sub-sections (a) -(w) of Section 25 (1)? It is

8 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

inconceivable that the legislature would have included several other

specific items of deductions in sub-sections (a) -(w) of Section 25(1), if all

the outgoings and expenses are restricted by the general limitation

provisions in Section 26 of the Act. In order to determine this question, it

is necessary to consider the relationship between Section 25 (1) and

Section 25 (1) (k), and the scheme of Section 25 (1) (k) and Section 26 (2)

of the Act.

What does section 26(2) say,

Deductions not allowed in

ascertaining profits and

income.

26.

(1) For the purpose of ascertaining the profits

or income of any person from any source, no

deduction shall be allowed in respect of

(2) No person carrying on any trade, business, profession or vocation shall be

entitled to any sum for depreciation by wear and tear, or for renewal, or to any

allowance under paragraph (a) or paragraph (d) of subsection (l) of section 25:-

(a) for any year of assessment, in respect of any vehicle used for

travelling for the purpose of his trade, business, profession or

vocation, except in respect of

(i) a motor cycle or bicycle used for such purpose by an

officer, who is not an executive officer, in the employment

of such person; and

(ii) a motor coach used for transporting employees of

such person to or from their place of work; and

(b) in respect of any plant, machinery, fixtures, equipment or

articles provided for the use of any officer or employee of such

person, in the place of residence of such officer or employee,

9 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

or for any deduction for any rental or annual payment in respect of

any such vehicle, plant, machinery, fixtures, equipment or articles

as are referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b).

Hence, section 26(2) is applicable with regard to paragraphs (a) and (d) of section

25(1) which read,

Deductions allowed

in ascertaining

profits and income.

25.

(1) Subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and

(4), there shall be deducted for the purpose of

ascertaining the profits or income of any person

from any source, all outgoings and expenses

incurred by such person in the production thereof,

including

(a) an allowance for depreciation by wear

and tear of the following assets acquired,

constructed or assembled and arising out

of their use by such person in any trade,

business, profession or vocation carried

on by him

(d) any sum expended by such person for the repair (not renewal) of any plant,

machinery, fixtures, building, implement, utensil or article employed for

producing such profits and income:

Provided that, in the case of a company carrying on the business of

letting premises, the sum deductible under this paragraph shall, in

so far as such sum relates to the repairs of such premises, not

10 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

exceed twenty five per centum of the gross rent receivable by such

company for such premises ;

It is submitted in paragraph 56 of the Written Submissions of the respondent

that,

As evidenced above, Section 26(2) refers to section 25(1)(a) and (c). Thus,

these sections have to be read together

However, Section 26(2) refers to paragraphs (a) and (d) of section 25(1) but not

paragraph (c).

The tax exemption is claimed not under those sections but under section

25(1)(k) and its Provisos.

It was said in Ogilvy Action (Pvt) Ltd., vs. Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (C. A. Tax 16/2013, dated 12.11.2021), that,

[52] One of the issues that has been argued extensively before this Court

is with regard to the true and correct interpretation to be given to the word

including at the end of Section 25 (1) of the Act. The Tax Appeals

Commission has taken the view that any deduction permitted under

Section 25 (1) including deductions specified in sub-sections (a) to (s) are

subject to the prohibitions on deductions set out in Section 26. Mr. Ameen

referred to the Privy Council decision in Patrick Alfred Reynolds v.

Commissioner for Income Tax, Trinidad & Tobago (supra) in support of his

argument that the use of the word including in introducing the catalogue

in Section 25 (1) enlarges the meaning of the words or phrases contained

in the statute. He submitted that if the intention was to make the list

exhaustive, the legislature would not have used the word including' only,

but would not have used the word means or the expression means and

includes.

In Patrick Alfred Reynolds vs. The Commissioner of Income Tax, [1965]

1967 A. C. 1, Lord Hodson speaking for the Privy Council said,

11 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

Section 10(1).

For the purpose of ascertaining the chargeable income of any person,

there shall be deducted all outgoings and expenses wholly and exclusively

incurred during the year preceding the year of assessment by such person

in the production of the income, including

Then there followed sub paragraphs (a) to (k) which give examples of

permissible deductions. It is unnecessary to set all these out in detail.

Many of them are indeed unnecessary for it is clear that without

considering the permissible deductions set out in the catalogue (a) to (k)

the taxpayer can make all legitimate deductions from his gross receipts

before arriving at the figure of his chargeable income. If he carries on a

business for profit, for example, the wages of his employees etc., are

deductible quite apart from the headings in the catalogue before the profit

can be ascertained. The catalogue is not in any sense exhaustive and

appears to be directed in the main to deductions of a business nature

which would naturally be covered by the phrase outgoings and

expensesincurredin the production of the income. There are, however,

certain sub paragraphs which the last observation does not fit, for

example, sub paragraph (j) is one which reads such other deductions as

may be prescribed by resolution of the Legislative Council.

There remains sub paragraph (f), around which the controversy has

centred. This reads:-

annuities or other annual payments whether payable within or

out of the Colony, either as a charge or any property of the person

paying the same by virtue of any deed or will or otherwise, or as a

reservation thereout, or as a personal debt or obligation by virtue of

any contract; Provided that no voluntary allowances or payment of

any description shall be deducted:

12 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

Section 12(1),

For the purpose of ascertaining the chargeable income of any person,

no deduction shall be allowed in respect of (a) domestic or private

expenses; (b) any disbursements or expenses not being money wholly and

exclusively laid out or expended for the purpose of acquiring the

income;(f) rent of or cost of repairs to any premises or part of premises

not paid or incurred for the purpose of acquiring the income;

..

Their Lordships will now answer the questions upon which the judgment

in this case depends.

First, what is the effect, upon its true construction, of section 10(1)(f),

bearing in mind the introductory words outgoings and expenses wholly

and exclusively incurredin the production of the income? If these words,

as the respondent argues, govern all of the following sub paragraphs (a) to

(k), the appellant must fail for it is not and cannot be contended that the

covenant in question, including incidentally those entered into by the

appellant personally, were entered into any way that could be covered by

the words in the production of the income. Moreover these words are

underlined in section 12(1)(b), where the words for the purpose of

acquiring the income repeated in section 12(1)(f) reinforces the argument

of the respondent.

On the other hand the use of the words including in introducing the

catalogues enables the appellant to submit, in the language of Lord

Watson giving the judgment of the board in Dilworth vs. Commissioner of

Stamps [1899] A. C. 99; 15 T. L. R. 61, P.C., that,

the word include is very generally used in interpretation clauses

to enlarge the meaning of words or phrases occurring in the body of

the statute; and when it is so used these words or phrases must be

13 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

construed as comprehending not only such things as they signify

according to their natural import, but also those things which the

interpretation clause declares that they shall include.

In Ogilvy Action (Pvt) Ltd., vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (C.

A. Tax 16/2013, dated 12.11.2021), the Court of Appeal said regarding the

decision in Patrick Alfred Reynolds vs. The Commissioner of Income Tax,

[67] The Privy Council considered the issue whether the general

limitation in Section 12 (1) (f), which prohibited the general deduction

under Section 10 (1), intended to take away the specific deduction that

has been expressly provided under Section 10 (1) (f) of the Income Tax

Ordinance (Laws of Trinidad and Tobago). Section 10 (1) of the Income Tax

Ordinance (Laws of Trinidad and Tobago) contains a similar structure to

Section 25 (1) of the Act and at the end of the body of the said Section,

refers to the word including as follows:

10 (1) -For the purpose of ascertaining the chargeable income of

any person, there shall be deducted all outgoings and expenses

wholly and exclusively incurred during the year preceding the year

of assessment by such person in the production of the income,

including........ [emphasis added]

[68] Then, there are sub-paragraphs (a) to (k) of Section 10 (1) which sets

out examples of permissible deductions and sub-paragraph (f) of Section

10 (1) allowed annuities to be deducted. It reads: 10 (1) (F) - annuities or

other annual payments, whether payable within or out of the Colony,

either as a charge on any property of the person paying the same by virtue

of any deed or will or otherwise, or as a reservation thereout, or as a

personal debt or obligation by virtue of any contract: Provided that no

voluntary allowances or payment of any description shall be deducted

[71] Having analysed the decision in Dilworth v. Commissioner of Stamps,

(supra), the Privy Council stated that:

1. Section 10 (1), on its true construction, and having regard to the

word including which was a word of extension, was intended to

embrace the deductions specified in sub-paragraphs (a) to (k) in

addition to all legitimate deductions of expenses incurred in the

production of income;

2. Section 12 (1) (b) which was of limited application, did not

negative or fetter the provisions of Section 10 (1) (f) of the Income

Tax Ordinance (Laws of Trinidad and Tobago).

In Hayley & Co., Ltd., vs. Commissioner of Inland Revenue [1961] Basnayake

C. J., said,

Whether a particular outgoing is deductible for the purpose of

ascertaining the profits or income of a business would depend on the

circumstances of each case subject to the provisions of section 10(c) which

forbids the deduction of any expenditure of a capital nature or any loss of

capitol. Where an outgoing is not of a capital nature or a loss of capital or

where its deduction is not expressly forbidden by the statute, it is

deductible under section 9(1) and it is not for the taxing authorities to say

that the payment should not have been made.

In Ogilvy Action (Pvt) Ltd., vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (C.

A. Tax 16/2013, dated 12.11.2021), it was said regarding Hayley & Co., Ltd.,

[16] Income chargeable with income tax is, however, arrived at after

taking into account the various exemptions and deductions allowed under

the Act and thus, the profits and income or profit or income on which

income tax is payable may be either exempted or deducted by the

provisions of the Act. Income tax is calculated by deducting general and

specific expenses from the taxpayers total assessable income for the

15 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

assessment year. In Hayley and Company Ltd v. Commissioner of Inland

Revenue (supra), Basnayake C.J., dealing with Section 9 (1) of the Income

Tax Ordinance of Ceylon (Cap. 188), which is the corresponding provision

of Section 25 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006, classified the

types of deductions for the purpose of Section 9 (1) of the Income Tax

Ordinance of Ceylon (Cap. 188).

[17] Basnayake C.J., stated that Section 9 (1) deals with three classes of

deductions, (i) outgoings; (ii) expenses incurred by the assessee in the

production of the profits or income and (iii) the specific deductions

allowed by paragraphs (a) -(i) thereof. The general deductions referred to

by Basnayake C.J., in Section 9 (1) are outgoings and expenses incurred

by the assessee in the production of profits and income while the

deductions referred to in paragraphs (a) -(i) thereof are the specific

deductions. A general deduction provision generally allows the taxpayer to

deduct from his assessable income any outgoings or expenses incurred in

the production of profits and income of any person.

The respondent has also submitted at paragraphs 103 to 105 of its Written

Submissions, that,

[103] Section 25(1)(k) does not recognize lease rentals or hire charges

as a permissible deduction. Therefore, a restrictive reading of Section 26(2)

as contended by the appellant would render the section nugatory and

superfluous. Such an interpretation would be contrary to a harmonious

interpretation of the Statute and would impede the clear legislative intent

of prohibiting deductions in respect of rentals or annual payments in

respect of vehicles used for travelling in connection with the business.

[104] This reading of the Statute is affirmed by a recent decision delivered

on the 3rd of August 2021 by Your Lordships Court in Distilleries Company

of Sri Lanka P. L. C. vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue C. A.

(TAX) dated 03.08.2021. In this case Your Lordships Court demonstrated

16 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

how foreign cases can only have persuasive value, particularly so in

relation to fiscal statutes which are to be interpreted strictly. In the case

cited, the House of Lord decision in Ushers Wiltshire Brewery Ltd., vs.

Bruce that was cited by the Counsel had the highest degree of relevance

in that the same expenditure was considered in the same circumstances.

However, the Court held that regardless of the high persuasive value of

such case, the case could not be applied because the English statute

differed structurally and semantically to the local statute under

consideration.

[105] Furthermore, Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka P. L. C. vs.

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, also considered the applicability

of the very same sections that are being considered by this Court in the

instant case; Section 25(1) and Section 26(1) of the Inland Revenue Act

No. 10 of 2006. In that case, Your Lordships Court considers the

combined effect of the two sections. Prior to considering the applicability

of Section 25 which permits deductions, the Court first examined to see

whether the deduction was prohibited under Section 26. The Court then

moved on to consider the applicability of Section 25, only when it was

established that Section 26 does not prohibit the said deduction. In other

words, it is only what is not prohibited by Section 26, that can be deducted

under Section 25.

If only what is not prohibited by Section 26 can be deducted under Section 25,

Section 25 is superfluous.

Although this Courts attention was drawn by the appellant in that case to

Ushers Wiltshire Brewery Ltd., vs. Bruce and several other English authorities,

in that case the case of Patrick Alfred Reynolds vs. The Commissioner of

Income Tax, in which the structure and semantics of section 10(1)(f) and 12

(1)(f) were similar to section 25(1)(k) and section 26(2) of the Inland Revenue Act

No. 10 of 2006, was not considered.

In Ushers Wiltshire Brewery Ltd., vs. Bruce, 1915 A. C. 433,

Where money is paid by a landlord, being a brewer, or allowed by him to

the tenant of a tied house, as a necessary incident of the profitable working

of the brewery business, the landlord is not prevented from deducting that

money, in his estimate of the balance of profits of his brewery business for

the purposes of assessment to income tax, by reason of the fact that it

enures also for the benefit of the tenants separate trade in the tied house.

So held on the authority of Smith vs. Lion Brewery Co. [1911] A. C. 150

A brewery company, as a necessary incident of the profitable working of

their brewery business, acquired and owned licensed houses which they

let to tied tenants, who, in consideration of the tie, paid a rent less than

the full annual value. The tenants were under an agreement to repair and

to pay rates and taxes, but the company in fact did the repairs and paid

rates and taxes in order to avoid loss of tenants. The company also in

respect of these houses paid premiums on insurances against fire and loss

of licenses and incurred legal expenses in connection with the renewal of

the licenses and otherwise. All these sums were solely and exclusively

expended or allowed by the brewery company for the purposes of their

business:-

Held that, in estimating the balance of the profits of their business for

the purpose of assessment to income tax, the brewery company were

entitled to deduct all these sums as expenses necessarily incurred for the

purpose of earning the profits.

Brickwood & Co. vs. Reynolds [1898] 1 Q. B. 95 overruled.

Decision of the Court of Appeal [1914] 2 K. B. 891 reversed.

Lord Sumner who allowed the appeal, said at page 469,

18 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

Next as to the rent. A trader who utilizes, for the purposes of his trade,

something belonging to him, be it chattel or real property, which he could

otherwise let for money, seems to me to put himself to an expense for the

purpose of his trade. Equally he does so if he hires or rents for that purpose

property belonging to another. The amount of his expense is prima facie

what he could have got for it by letting it in the one case and what he pays

for it when hiring it in the other. Where he gets something back for it, while

employing it in his trade, by receiving rent or hire for it in connection with

that trade, the true amount of his expense can only be arrived at by giving

credit for such receipt.

In principle, therefore, I think that in the present case rent foregone, either

by letting houses, which the brewers own, to tied tenants at a low rent

instead of to free tenants at a full rack rent in the open market, or by

letting houses in the same way, which they hire and then re let at a loss,

is money expended within the first rule applying to both of the first two

cases of Schedule D and that upon the findings of the special case, which

are conclusive, it is wholly and exclusively expended for the purposes

of such trade.

B. P. Australia Ltd., vs. Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of

Australia 1965 3 All E. R. 209, was another case cited by the appellant in that

case. It was said in B. P. Australia,

The appellant (B. P.) carried on business as a supplier of petrol in

Australia. In and after 1951 a system of sale through tied garages was

introduced by another supplier. B. P. were asked by many retailers to

remove their pumps. In endeavours to obtain tied stations throughout

Australia, by means of solo site agreements, whereby B. P. would make

lump sum payments (development allowances) to retailers for the

improvement of service stations, B. P., spent in the tax year ending June,

1952, 270,569 Sterling Pounds either in payment direct to the retailers

19 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

under solo cite agreements or by way of adjustments with the other co

operating companies in respect of such payments made by them. By a solo

cite agreement the retailer agreed to resell from his premises only brands

of petrol approved by B. P. The average duration of a solo site agreement

was five years. The lump sum expenditure of B. P. involved in relation to

these solo cite agreements for the year ending June, 1952 was disallowed

as a deduction in assessing B. P.s profits for tax, on the ground that it

was capital expenditure.

Held: the lump sum payments by B. P. paid for the solo site agreements with

retailers were expenditure of a revenue rather than a capital nature and

therefore were deductible in computing B. P.s profits for income tax purposes

for the following reasons:-

(i) the answer to the question whether the expenditure was of a revenue

nature must be reached by a commonsense appreciation of all the

guiding features.

Dictum of Viscount Radcliff in Commissioner of Taxes vs. Nchanga

Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd., ([1964] 1 All E. R. at page 212)

applied.

(ii) Applying the tests stated by Dixon J., in Sun Newspapers Ltd., vs.

Federal Commissioner of Taxation ((1938), 61 C. L. R. 337) and

Hallstorms Proprietary Ltd., vs. Federal Commissioner of Taxation

((1946), 72 C. L. R. at page 647), (a) the character of the advantage

sought by B. P. through the solo site agreements pointed to the

expenditure being of a revenue nature, as B. P.s purpose was to

obtain orders for petrol by up to date marketing methods, as the

lump sums were prima facie circulating capital for they must come

back bit by bit in orders for retailers, as the expenditure was

recurrent if regard were had to the whole picture and as, on ordinary

principles of commercial accounting, allocation of the expenditure

20 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

to revenue would be preferable; (b) the manner in which the benefit

obtained by B. P. was to be used pointed to the expenditure being

allocatable against revenue, as the solo site agreements become part

of the ordinary process of selling; (c) expenditure incurred in making

a radical alteration in a companys marketing arrangements need

not be capital expenditure and (d) though the duration of the solo

site agreements did not point clearly to revenue or capitol, yet the

fact that the payments were made on the average for five years was

a neutral factor which gave no indication towards capital which

outweighted (a) and (b) above.

Anglo Persian Oil Co., Ltd. vs. Dale ([1931] All E. R. 725) applied.

Bolam (Inspector of Taxes) vs. Regent Oil Co., Ltd. ((1956), 37 Tax

Cases 56) considered.

Per Curiam: it cannot be accepted that a chose in action must be a

capital benefit if its value outlives the year of accounting.

Hinton (Inspector of Taxes) vs. Maden and Ireland Ltd., ([1959] 3 All

E. R. 356) distinguished.

Lord Pearce, said at page 219,

It is argued that here there is nothing to show that the retailers would

or could insist on fresh payments for a renewal at the end of the periods;

but the reasonable inference is that they would and could do so. Unless

the demand for petrol exceeds the supply (which on a balance of

probabilities seems quite unlikely), the retailers would at the end of the

period be in a position as good as or better than their original position.

The fact that B. P. did not regard the lump sum payments as a

permanent solution, but considered that some other method should

be found, does not prevent their being of a recurrent nature. A

temporary ad hoc solution is none the less of a recurrent nature because

21 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

it is recognized that when the problem recurs it may have to be met in

some other or more permanent fashion. Nor does the fact that in some

cases B. P. dealt with the problem by an admittedly capital solution (e. g.

by buying the service station itself and letting it to a customer) affect the

question whether the method here in issue was a capital or income

solution. Moreover there were fresh sums being paid each year to fresh

retailers, a fact which cannot be wholly disregarded in considering whether

there is a recurrent demand.

In the backdrop of Patrick Alfred Reynolds vs. The Commissioner of Income

Tax [1965] and Hayley & Co., Ltd., vs. Commissioner of Inland Revenue

[1961] and the analysis adopted in Ogilvy Action (Pvt) Ltd., vs. Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue (C. A. Tax 16/2013, dated 12.11.2021), the

respondent has not shown any reason not to allow the deduction claimed.

Therefore, it is decided that the appellant is entitled to deduct the said sum of

Rs. 9,653,695/- under and in terms of section 25(1)(k) of the Inland Revenue Act

No. 10 of 2006.

Hence, the Questions of Law are answered as set out below,

(1) Is the amount of Rs. 9,653,695/- paid by the appellant to the employees

for the use of the vehicles of the employees for the purposes of the business

of the appellant, deductible in terms of section 25(1)(k) of the Inland

Revenue Act in the computation of the profits of the appellant for the year

of assessment 2008/2009, notwithstanding any prohibition in section 26(2)

of the same Act?

Yes.

(2) Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law in assuming that its conclusion

that section 25(1)(k) and 26(2) should be read together provides a sufficient

basis for the purpose of determining the issue raised in this appeal on

22 | C . A . T a x 3 2 2 0 1 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

behalf of the appellant, namely, that the expenditure especially provided for

in section 25(1)(k) which is a special provision should be deducted

notwithstanding any prohibition in Section 26(2)?

Yes. While there is no objection to read the two sections together, the effect

of such reading is not to disallow the special deduction permitted by the

former.

(3) Did the Tax Appeals Commission fail to properly examine and or apply and

or appreciate the facts and the law relevant to this matter?

Does not arise in view of answers given to Question Nos. (1) and (2)

Hence further, this Court annuls the assessment issued by the Assessor for the

Year of Assessment 2008/2009 in respect of the sum of Rs. 9,653,695/- claimed

by the appellant under and in terms of section 25(1)(k) of the Inland Revenue

Act.

In the circumstances, the appeal in the form of a case stated is allowed. The

respondent will pay the cost of this appeal to the appellant.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

Hon. Pradeep Kirthisinghe J.,

I agree.
