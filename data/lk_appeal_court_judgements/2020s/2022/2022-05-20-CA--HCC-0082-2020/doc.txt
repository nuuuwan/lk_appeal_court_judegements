Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Kegalle on three counts of grave sexual abuse of a

minor (hereinafter referred to as the victim) between the period of 1st May 2010

and 31st April 2011, punishable in terms of section 365 B (2)(b) of the Penal

Code as amended.

In the first and the second counts, it was alleged that the appellant kissed the

genital area of the victim child and in the third count, the allegation was that

he touched the genital area of the victim child.

It needs to be noted that initially, all three charges against the appellant were

on the basis that he touched the genital area and thereby committed the

offence. However, the 1st and the 2nd charge had been amended as above before

the commencement of the trial against the appellant.

After trial, the appellant was found guilty for the 1st and the 3rd count preferred

against him by the learned High Court Judge of Kegalle, while he was acquitted

Page 3 of 17

of the 2nd count. He was sentenced to 12 years rigorous imprisonment on each

of the two counts to be served concurrently. In addition, he was ordered to pay

a fine of Rs. 10000/- for each of the counts where he was found guilty, and in

default six-month imprisonment on each count was ordered.

Being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence, the appellant preferred

this appeal.

Facts in brief: -

It was an admitted fact that the victim (PW-01) was born on the 02nd of April

1999. According the evidence of the victim the alleged incidents happened to

her when she was in grade 7 at her school and during the early part of the

year. However, she was not able to give an exact date or dates of the incidents.

When prosecution suggested the dates as between 01-05-2010 and 31-04-2011

she has agreed that she faced the incidents during that period. She has stated

that she was about 11 years old at that time. However, when she gave evidence

in the Court, she had been a 19-year-old youth. She had a younger sister who

was seven years her junior. Her mother worked at a garment factory while the

father had no fixed occupation. He was in the habit of leaving the younger

sister in the care of the victim and leave the house looking for liquor once she

returned from school.

The appellant, whom the victim identified as Mama ( ), at the trial was a

neighbour who lived close to their house with his family, and he had a

daughter of similar age to her sister. The appellant was in the habit of coming

to their house to take her sister to his house in order let her play with his

child. The victim child also used to go with her to the house of the appellant as

she could not send her alone.

According to her, during these visits, the appellant, using opportunities where

he could avoid other members of the household seeing his actions, used to

touch her genital area and when she resisted the appellant threatened her and

Page 4 of 17

her family with death telling her not to tell her parents. In her evidence she has

stated that this continued over a period of time and at one point he tried to

insert his finger into her genitalia and on another occasion kissed her genitalia.

However, she has not divulged what was happening to her to the parents due

to the fear she had for the appellant. When it came to a situation where she

could no longer bear what was happening, she has gone after school to her

grandmothers house which was some distance away from their house and had

informed the grandmother that she is being sexually abused by the appellant

and had wanted her to inform the parents.

As their house had no telephone facility, it was to the house of the appellant

the grandmother had given a call and had got in touch with the mother of the

victim. On the information they received, the parents of the victim had gone to

the house of the grandmother in the night and had complained to Deraniyagala

police on that night itself. Later, the police have produced her before a doctor

for a medical examination. The position of the appellant had been that the this

was a false allegation against him due to a land dispute he had with the family

of the victim, which the witness has denied saying that before the complaint

they had no disputes.

It was the evidence of the mother of the victim that on the day relevant to the

incident, when she came home from work, she was informed by her husband

that the elder daughter did not return home from school. It was her evidence

that her family and the family of the appellant had a very close friendly

relationship and she used to leave her children under their care often. While

looking for the child she has received a call from her mother informing that the

child is with her and requiring to come immediately to take the child to the

hospital. As their house had no telephone facilities the call has been given to

the house of the appellant as for the usual practice. She and her husband has

found the child at her mothers house around 10.00 p.m., and after inquiring

from her what happened, they have gone to the Deraniyagala police on that

Page 5 of 17

night itself and had lodged a complaint. According to her, the complaint was

made to the police at around 2.00 a.m. on 2nd April 2011.

PW-03, Seelawathie the grandmother of the victim has given evidence in this

case. It was her evidence that the elder child of her eldest daughter came to

her home and informed that a with whom the child had been left with

sexually harassed her and because of that she is not willing to go back home.

After keeping the child with her, she has informed her daughter through a

telephone call given to the house of the appellant as her daughter had no

telephone facilities that such a thing had happened to the victim, namely, her

granddaughter Priyangika Dharshini.

According to her the child has informed that it was

that did the things mentioned to her and she has identified the appellant as the

person concerned.

The police officer who investigated the complaint PS-30858 Gunaratne in his

evidence has stated that the victim and the appellants houses were about 30

meters apart and the child failed to show a particular place where the incidents

happened but it was revealed that the incidents happened in the childs house.

After the investigations the appellant had been arrested on the 02-04-2011.

The fact that the first complaint in that regard was received by the police on

02-04-2011 at 1:00 am and the fact that the appellants statement was

recorded on 03-04-2011 at 7:05 am are facts that had been admitted. As the

medico legal report with regard to the child has also been an admitted fact. It

has been marked as P-02 at the trial.

After the conclusion of the prosecution evidence and when the defence was

called, the appellant had chosen to give evidence under oath. It has been his

evidence that he was a person who retired after serving in the army and he is

not guilty of the offence.

Page 6 of 17

Under cross examination, he has admitted that the family of the victim and his

family are neighbours and there were no issues between the families until this

incident. However, when asked for the reason for such a serious allegation to

be leveled against him, he has stated that his wife works at Basnagala Maha

Vidyalaya as a teacher and the victim childs fathers younger brother ( )

was the person who ran the school canteen. He had an animosity with his wife

because of her refusal as a teacher of the primary classes of the school for the

children to visit the canteen often. It was his position that because of this, the

childs relative harassed his wife and prevented her from doing her job and

threatened that he will teach a good lesson to him, referring to the appellant.

As a result, the said relative of the child and the mother of the child got

together and made this false allegation against him was his stand.

At the conclusion of the trial the learned High Court Judge convicted the

appellant for the first and the third counts preferred against him and

sentenced the appellant as stated before.

Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel, although he has

formulated 12 separate grounds of appeal in his written submissions,

submitted the following matters for the consideration of the Court.

It was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel that the second and the

third counts preferred against the appellant in the indictment refers to

something that happened at different times and not in the same transaction.

Referring to the provisions relating to joinder of charges as referred in the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, it was his contention that the three

counts so preferred against the appellant had been wrongly combined as they

appeared to be not in the same transaction as stated in the charges itself.

He contended further that there was no April 31 in a year, and since it was an

admitted fact that the appellant was arrested on the 02nd of April, there was no

Page 7 of 17

reason for the prosecution to extend the period of the offence up to a non-

existing date like the 31st of April, and therefore, the charges preferred against

the appellant are bad in law.

Making submissions as to the credibility of the evidence by the prosecutrix, it

was contended that although the prosecution has formulated two counts

against the appellant on the basis that he kissed the genital area and another

count on the basis on touching the genital area, apparently, based on what the

victim said to the police and based on the investigations, the testimony of the

prosecutrix before the Court was different.

In the testimony, what she has stated was that the kissing of the genital area

happened only once. It was his position that under the circumstances, the

learned High Court Judge should have looked for corroboration of the evidence

of the prosecutrix, and it was not safe to act only on her evidence given the

infirmities in the evidence.

The learned Presidents Counsel further argued that it was strange for a child

to not to inform her parents what was happening to her, even though the child

has claimed that she was threatened with death by the appellant. Further, it

was contended that the evidence of PW-03 the grandmother of the child was

different to what the child has said in Court and the grandmothers evidence

suggests that the child has not spoken about any sexual acts as she narrated

in the Court.

It was also his position that if informed of sexual harassment by the appellant,

it was strange for the grandmother to call the house of the appellant who was

the person against the allegations are being made, and inform her elder

daughter about the situation of the prosecutrix as claimed by the witnesses.

According to the evidence of the police the child has pointed to a different place

as the place of the incident and she was unable to point to a particular place as

to where the incidents happened. It was the position of the learned Presidents

Page 8 of 17

Counsel that this was a concocted story by the police against the appellant and

under the circumstances the failure by the prosecution to mention a particular

date as the date of offence has caused prejudice to the appellant.

Finally, it was his submission that the case against that the appellant was not

proved beyond reasonable doubt before the Court and hence, the appellant

should have been acquitted by the learned High Court Judge rather than

convicting him for the first and the third counts preferred against him.

It was the submission of the learned State Counsel that no prejudice has been

caused to the appellant due to the wrong mentioning of the time period of the

offence ending as at 31-04-2011 since it is apparent to anybody that there is

no 31st day in the month of April. Although the appellant has been admittedly

arrested on 02-04-2011 there was no evidence by any of the witnesses before

the trial Court that the incidents happened after the arrest.

It was contended that there was no belatedness in the complaint, given the

facts and the circumstances. It was his position that the charges had been

correctly framed and proven beyond reasonable doubt.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

The evidence of the victim child clearly suggests that she was subjected to

sexual abuse over a period of time and the child has gone to her grandmother

after it became unbearable to her.

Under the circumstances, it clearly appears that the prosecution has preferred

three counts of grave sexual abuse against the appellant considering the

limitations as to the joinder of charges as provided for in the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 (Act). The prosecution has formulated the

charges based on Section 174 of the Act which reads as follows:

1. When a person is accused of more offences than one of the same

kind committed within the space of twelve months from the first

Page 9 of 17

to the last of such offences maybe charged with and tried at one

trial for any number of them not exceeding three, and in trials

before the high court such charges maybe included in one and

the same indictment.

2. Offences are of the same kind when they are punishable with the

same amount of punishment under the same section of the Penal

Code or of any special or local law.

Clearly, the prosecution has chosen to charge the appellant for three offences

of same kind committed within a period of one year, punishable in terms of

Section 365B(2)(b) of the Penal Code as amended by Act No. 22 of 1995 and 29

of 1999.

It is correct that in formulating the charges the prosecution has wrongly

included the end date of the offence as 31-04-2011, where there is no date as

31st for the month of April. However, I am in agreement with the learned State

Counsel that the said mistake has caused no prejudice whatsoever to the

appellant, since there was no allegation against him beyond his date of arrest.

The proviso to Article 138 of the Constitution of the Republic, which gives the

jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal to hear and determine the appeals from any

Court of First Instance reads as follows;

Provided that no judgment, decree, or order of any court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

Hence, I find no basis in the above discussed ground of appeal as the said

irregularity has not caused any prejudice to the appellant or occasioned a

failure of justice.

Page 10 of 17

Before considering any other ground of appeal urged, I would now consider

whether the victims failure to give evidence as to a specific date or dates that

she was subjected to the grave sexual abuse by the appellant can be

considered as a basis to conclude that the prosecution has failed to prove its

case beyond reasonable doubt, or amount to a denial of a fair trial for the

appellant.

It is abundantly clear from the evidence of the victim that she was speaking of

several acts of sexual abuse over a period of time by the appellant by taking

advantage of her age and the vulnerable position that she was in, during the

time period relevant to this action. According to the victim, she was studying in

grade 7 in the school when the incidents happened and they happened during

the early part of the year. The victim was a child of about 11 years of age at the

time relevant to the incident and a 19-year-old married mother of a child, when

she gave evidence in the High Court in February 2019. One has to understand

her evidence under that context, given the stigma attached in our society to

these kinds of incidents. Very often than not, child victims tend to forget the

exact dates upon which they had to face such sexual abuse.

I am of the view that the victims failure to mention specific dates rather than

mentioning a time period becomes relevant in an action of this nature only if it

can be determined that it had caused any prejudice to the appellant. I am

unable to come to any conclusion as such, given the fact that the indictment

was not based on a particular date but during a period of one year. Admittedly

the appellant was arrested on the 2nd of April 2011, soon after the complaint

against him was lodged with the police. Given the fact that the victim in her

evidence has narrowed down the relevant period to the early part of the year

before she informed what was happening to her grandmother, there would have

been no difficulty for the appellant to understand the relevant period as to the

allegations against him.

Page 11 of 17

The case of Madawala Gedara Premadasa Vs. The Attorney General

C.A.261/2009 decided on 26-05-2014 was a matter where the facts as to the

date of the incident was similar to the matter under consideration in this

appeal. It was held:

Per Anil Gooneratne, J.

On the question of vagueness of the incident regarding the date of

the incident and the reference made therein to the period, we cannot

see any prejudice being caused to the accused party, on this aspect

since it was not an incident but the alleged acts had been

committed on several dates, which shows repetition and

continuation of acts.

Considering the necessity of affording a fair trial to an accused in a case where

a specific date has been mentioned in the charge, unlike the appeal under

consideration, it was held in the case of R. Vs. Dossi 13 Cr. App. R. 158;

That a date specified in an indictment is not a material matter unless it is

essential part of the alleged offence, the defendant may be convicted

although the jury finds that the offence was committed on a date other

than that specified in the indictment. Amendment of the indictment is

unnecessary, although it will be good practice to do so. Provided that there

was no prejudice, where it is clear on the evidence that if the offence was

committed on the day other than that specified.

Further, it was stated in the case of Wright Vs. Nicholson 54 Cr. App. R. 38;

That the prosecution should not be allowed to depart from an allegation

that an offence was committed on a particular day in reliance on the

principle in the Dossi if there is a risk that the defendant has been misled

as to the allegation he has to answer or that he would be prejudiced in

having to answer a less specific allegation.

Page 12 of 17

For the reasons adduced above, I find no merit in the considered ground of

appeal as there is no basis to conclude that the appellant was misled as to the

charges against him or any prejudice has been caused to him.

Having considered the grounds of appeal as above, I will now turn my attention

to the contention that the evidence of the victim was not credible enough as to

the alleged incidents of sexual abuse and was also not probable, for the learned

trial judge to rely on her evidence alone, and he should have looked for

corroboration as to the evidence of the victim and also the contention that the

evidence of the grandmother does not corroborate the evidence of the victim.

As I have discussed earlier, no reasonably prudent person can expect a child of

about 11 years of age at the time of facing several acts of sexual abuse as

alleged to remember all the minute details of such acts long after the incidents.

It is my considered view that the issue of credibility is a matter that has to be

decided after considering the evidence of a victim of child abuse in its totality

and not by considering parts of evidence in its isolation.

It was held in the Indian case of Bhoginbhai Hitijibhai Vs. State of Gujarat

AIR 1983- SC 753 at page 756-758, that;

1) By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a videotape

is replayed on the mental screen.

2) Ordinarily, so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The

witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an

element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to

be attuned to absorb the details.

3) The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one may

notice, and the other may not. An object or movement might emboss its

image on one persons mind, whereas it might go unnoticed on the part

another.

Page 13 of 17

4) By and large people cannot accurately recall a conversation and

reproduce the very words used by them or heard by them. They can

only recall the main purpose of the conversation. It is unrealistic to

expect a witness to be a human tape recorder.

5) In regard to exact time of an incident, or the time duration of an

occurrence, usually people make their estimates by guesswork on the

spur of the moment at the time of interrogation. And one cannot expect

people to make very precise or reliable estimates of such matters. Again,

it depends on the time-sense of individuals which varies from person to

person.

6) Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the

sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short

time span. A witness is liable to get confused or mixed up when

interrogated later on.

7) A witness, though wholly truthful, is liable to be overawed by the court

atmosphere and the piercing cross-examination made by counsel and

out of nervousness mix up facts, get confused regarding sequence of

events, or fill up details from imagination on the spur of the moment. The

sub-conscious mind of the witness sometime so operates on account of

the fear of looking foolish or being disbelieved though the witnesses is

giving truthful and honest account of the occurrence witnessed by him

perhaps it is a sort of a psychological defense mechanism activated on

the spur of the moment.

As I have stated earlier, the evidence clearly establishes the fact that the victim

has been subjected to sexual abuse over a period of time, although the charges

have been formulated limiting them to three acts of sexual abuse over a period

of a year given the legal constraints in formulating charges in a situation like

this. Therefore, her evidence needs to be evaluated in that context in mind.

Page 14 of 17

Although the charges have been framed on the basis of two acts of kissing of

the genital area, I am unable to agree that the victims evidence that kissing of

her genital area by the appellant happened only once and her failure to come

up with what she has stated to the police in her statement in detail when giving

evidence, as matters that affects the credibility of her version of events.

When considering the argument that it was strange for the victim to not to

inform her parents of the sexual abuse suffered by her even if there was a

death threat, that fact needs to be considered given her home environment that

prevailed during the time relevant to the alleged offences. According to her

evidence, her father was a person who was addicted to liquor and the mother

being the only stable income earner of the family had to be away from home

most of the day. The victim had been a child burdened with household chores

in addition to her studies, including looking after her younger sister. It is

obvious that the victim has done the next best thing after the sexual abuses

suffered by her became unbearable by informing her grandmother who lived

away from their own home.

I am unable to agree with the contention that if the victim told the

grandmother that she was being sexually abused by the appellant, would she

give a call to the house of the appellant and inform that to the mother of the

child. It is clear from the evidence that until the victim went and informed her

grandmother what was happening to her, the two families who lived close to

each other had a good relationship between them. According to the evidence of

the grandmother, as her daughters house had no telephone facilities whenever

she wanted to contact her it was to the house of the appellant she used to call

and get in contact with her daughter. It appears that she has followed the

usual practice on this occasion also, which was not unusual.

The evidence of the mother of the victim shows that her mother contacted her

by giving a call to the appellants house and informed her to come immediately

and the child needs to be taken to the hospital. This has prompted the parents

Page 15 of 17

going to the house of PW-03 and after learning what has happened, the have

gone to the police station in the night itself and made the relevant complaint.

In her evidence, the grandmother of the child has confirmed that her

granddaughter came to her and informed that she is being sexually harassed

by the appellant to whom the grandmother says that the child referred to as

. Mallika is the name of the wife of the appellant. It

appears from her evidence that when the parents came and inquired from her,

she was even reluctant to tell them what the child told her, instead she has

asked the mother of the child to inquire from the child. It appears even in

Court when giving evidence she was reluctant to narrate it in detail the exact

words told to her by her granddaughter. I find that this is perfectly

understandable behaviour of an elderly village woman who had to listen to the

sexual abuses faced by her granddaughter at the hand of an elderly known

person.

The evidence of the police officer who conducted the inquiries, namely police

sergeant Gunaratne, confirmed that the complaint with regards to this incident

received by the police station at 1:00 a.m. on 02-04-2011. It was evident that

the victim has failed to pinpoint one particular place where the incident or

incidents took place. I find that this was very much in line with the evidence of

the victim. In her evidence she has clearly stated that the incidents of sexual

abuse happened in the house of the appellant and also the appellant used to

come to their home for the same purpose and she used to avoid as much as

possible.

For the reasons stated as above, I find that the evidence of the victim was

credible and cogent enough. It is an accepted fact that any sexual offender

would be careful that his actions would not be seen by others. Therefore, it is

virtually impossible in an offence of this nature to find corroborative evidence

of eye witnesses to such an incident or incidents. It is well settled law that in

offences of this nature, if the evidence of the prosecutrix is cogent, trustworthy

Page 16 of 17

and credible a trial court can act on that evidence alone. However, in the

instant action, I am of the view the evidence of the mother as well as the

grandmother and the medical officer who examined the child are consistent

with the evidence of the victim.

The Indian Supreme Court in Bhoginbhai Hirijibai Vs. The State of Gujarat

(supra) it was held:

In the Indian setting refusal to act on the testimony on a victim of sexual

assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding insult to the

injury

In the case of D. Tikiri Banda Vs. Attorney-General CA 64/2003 decided

06-10-2009 reported in the Bar Association Law Journal (2010) (BLR) 92

held:

a) If delay of making a statement is explainable the evidence of a witness

should not be rejected on that ground alone.

c) Mostly the victims of sexual harassment prefer not to talk about the

harrowing experience and would like to forget about the incident as soon

as possible (withdrawal syndrome). The offenders should not be allowed

to capitalize of take mean advantage of these natural inherent

weaknesses of small children.

d) Insignificant omission of such a victim or her utterance of dreadful

words should not be taken as a contradiction having effect or impact on

the credibility of the victim.

g) If the evidence of the victim could be relied on, is trustworthy, firm etc.

there is no impediment on the part of the court in acting solely on the

evidence of the victim and it is only when the evidence of the victim suffers

from some infirmity or where the courts believe that it would not be

Page 17 of 17

prudent to base a conviction solely on that evidence the court should look

for corroboration.

I find that the appellant has failed to create any reasonable doubt or provide a

reasonable explanation as to the incriminating evidence against him. His

explanation that there was a land dispute between the parties when the victim

was giving evidence and the victims had a dispute with his wife in his

evidence, are contradictory to each other, which does not create any doubt as

to the evidence of the prosecution. I find no reason for the victim or her family

members to accuse the appellant falsely, given the close relationship the family

of the appellant and the family of the victim had and also given the fact that no

parent would involve a girl child of this age falsely in a complaint of this nature

due to the social stigma attached to such complaints.

For the reasons as adduced above, I find that the prosecution has proved the

case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and the learned High

Court Judge has reached his verdict after giving due consideration as to the

facts and the relevant law, with clear reasoning. Hence, I find no reason to

interfere with the conviction and sentence of the learned High Court Judge.

The appeal therefore is dismissed as it is devoid of merit. The conviction and

the sentence affirmed. However, considering the fact that the appellant had

been in incarceration since the date of the conviction, the sentence is ordered

to be effective from the date of the conviction namely, from 04-09-2020.
