JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted by the Attorney General at the High

Court of Colombo for committing an offence under Section 364(2) read with

Section 364(2)(e) of the Penal Code as amended on Weerasinghe Pathiranage

Sadushi Umanga between 23/05/2012 and 02/07/2012.

After the trial, the Appellant was convicted as charged and was sentenced to

15 years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.25000/-, in default of

which 01-year rigorous imprisonment was imposed. In addition,

Rs.250000/- was imposed as compensation payable to the victim with a

default sentence of 02 years rigorous imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that

the Appellant had given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to

the Covid 19 pandemic. During the argument, he was connected via Zoom

from prison.

3 | P a g e

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that the video recording

of the statement of the complainant has not been corroborated in

material particulars by evidence from an independent source as

required by Section 163A (5) of the Evidence Ordinance.

2. That the prosecution had followed totally illegal procedure when the

evidence of the prosecutrix was led before the court.

3. The Learned Trial Judge had failed to consider that the chief

investigating officer had a strong motive to fabricate a case against the

Appellant and therefore she was an interested witness.

The Facts of this case albeit briefly are as follows.

In this case, the prosecution had led the video evidence of a preliminary

interview of the prosecutrix conducted and recorded by the Child Protection

Authority at the time of the investigation was played before the Learned Trial

Judge in terms of Section 163 (A) of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No

32 of 1999. Prior to leading video evidence of the prosecution, the

prosecution had led evidence of official witnesses who had taken part in the

process of recording of video evidence to establish that the recording had

been done after following due process.

In the video evidence, the prosecutrix had said that she had received

education up to year 10 at Porambuwa Vidyalaya. She has siblings and her

mother was employed at a Tea Factory while her father was employed under

a road contractor. On 2nd of June 2012 the Appellant had taken the

prosecutrix to a guest house situated on Bangama Road and committed rape

on her. Prior to the incident, the Appellant had helped the prosecutrix in

numerous ways to continue her education and sport activities. A mobile

phone was also gifted to the prosecutrix.

4 | P a g e

Few days after this incident, she was again taken to the same guest house

by the Appellant and committed rape on her. Prior to the video recording she

had given a statement to Akuressa Police Station but not revealed these

incidents due to fear of the Appellant as the Appellant was the Chairman of

the Akuressa Pradeshaya Saba at that time.

The prosecution has placed the video evidence as evidence-in-chief of the

prosecutrix and the defence was allowed to cross-examine the witness.

Before the defence cross-examine the victim, the State Counsel making an

application requested that he asks specific questions which had not been

put to the prosecutrix when her statement was video recorded. Permission

was granted and the State Counsel instead of asking some peripheral

matters had posted lengthy examination-in-chief. During the State Counsels

examination-in-chief, the prosecutrix had claimed that no such incident

happened to her from the Appellant. She confirmed the same in her cross-

examination too.

In the first ground of appeal, the Learned Presidents Counsel appearing for

the Appellant contended that the Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider

that the video recording of the statement of the complainant has not been

corroborated in material particulars by evidence from an independent source

as required by Section 163A (5) of the Evidence ordinance.

Section 163 A (5) of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No.32 of 1999

states:

(5) Where the child witness, in the course of his direct oral testimony

before court, contradicts, either expressly or by necessary implication,

any statement previously made by him and disclosed by the video

recording, it shall be lawful for the presiding judge, if he considers it

safe and just in all the circumstances of the case, to act upon such

previous statement as disclosed by video recording, if such previous

5 | P a g e

statement is corroborated in material particulars by evidence from an

independent source.

The Learned Presidents Counsel argued, highlighting the above-mentioned

section, that the prosecution had failed to adduce corroborative evidence as

required by law as the prosecutrix had gone back on her statement, which

had been recorded on the video. Hence the learned Presidents Counsel

strenuously argued that the prosecution had not proven the case against the

Appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

Corroborating evidence is the proof which strengthens or confirms the

evidence which already exists. Such independent evidence backs up the

testimony of a witness.

In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Hester [1972] 3 A.E.R 1056 the

House of Lords held that:

The essence of corroboration evidence is that one creditworthy witness

conforms what another creditworthy witness had said. Any risk of the

conviction of an innocent person is lessened if conviction is based upon

the testimony of more than one acceptable witness The purpose of

corroboration is not to give validity or credence to evidence which is

deficient or suspect or incredible but only to confirm and support that

which as evidence is sufficient and satisfactory and credible; and

corroborative evidence with only fill its role if it in itself is completely

credible evidence.

In Fernando v. The Republic [1978] 79 (II) NLR 313 Vythialingam, J. held

that:

In our law of evidence corroboration is a term which has a special

significance. In the conventional sense as used in our courts it means

6 | P a g e

other independent evidence which confirms or supports or strengthens

the evidence which is required to be corroborated. In the case of certain

categories of witnesses, statues or judges, as a matter of prudence and

caution require that their evidence should be corroborated before it is

accepted and acted upon

The term, however, may also be used in a more popular sense to denote

evidence which renders other evidence more probable. For example, it is

in this latter sense that the term is used in Section 157 of the Evidence

Ordinance which makes admissible any former statement by a witness

relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place or

before any authority competent to investigate the fact, in order to

corroborate him.

In Ariyadasa v. Queen 70 NLR 3 the court held that:

The corroboration that Section 157 contemplates is not corroboration in

the conventional sense in which the term is used in courts of law but in

a sense of consistency in the conduct of a witness tending his testimony

more acceptable.

The Learned Presidents Counsel submitted to this Court that the Learned

High Court Judge had wrongly concluded that the prosecution had

corroborated the evidence of PW1 through the evidence given by PW4, PW18

and PW20. PW4 is the doctor who had examined the victim and issued the

Medico Legal Report. PW18 is the probation officer who had submitted a

report pertaining to the prosecutrix to the court. PW20 is the psychiatric

specialist who had also submitted a report pertaining to the prosecutrix to

the court. The relevant portion of the judgment is re-produced below:

(Page 582 of the brief.)

The Learned Presidents Counsel submitting several judgments argued that

the considering the above-mentioned witnesses as corroborative witnesses

by the Learned High Court Judge has caused great injustice to the Appellant.

He argued that the leading evidence of PW4, PW18 and PW20 in this case

only shows the consistency of the prosecutrixs evidence.

In Sana v. Republic of Sri Lanka [2009] 1 SLR 48 the court held that:

(1) The corroborative facts and evidence must proceed from someone

other than the witness to be corroborated. This means that his previous

statements, even when admissible cannot be used to corroborate him,

such as proof of a complaint in a sexual case or a previous act of

identification is not corroborative of the evidence of die witness, even

though by showing consistency, it can to some extent strengthen his

credibility.

Where an accused is charged with rape corroboration of the story of the

prosecutrix must come from some independent quarter and not from the

prosecutrix herself. A complaint made by the prosecutrix to the police in

which she implicated the accused cannot be regarded as corroboration

of her evidence.

Evidence of a victim in a case of sexual assault cannot be corroborated

by a subsequent statement made by her. The Learned Trial judge was

8 | P a g e

wrong when he concluded that the evidence of the victim had been

corroborated by her short history given to the doctor.

In King v. Atukorale 50 N.L.R. 256 Gratiaen, J. held that:

The corroboration which should be looked for in cases of this kind is

some independent testimony which affects the accused by connecting

or tending to connect him with the crime, and it is settle law that

although the particulars of a complaint made by a prosecutrix shortly

after the alleged offence may be given in evidence against the prisoner

as evidence of the consistency of her conduct with her evidence given

at the trial, such complaint cannot be regarded as corroboration in

the proper sense in which that word is understood in cases of this kind.

In S. Rajaratnam v. The Republic of Sri Lanka 79(1) N.L.R. 73

Thamotheram,J. held that:

(1) That the corroborating required where the charge is one of rape is

some independent testimony which affects the accused by connecting

or tending to connect him with the crime. A statement made by the

prosecutrix to her grandmother, after the event cannot constitute the

kind of corroboration required.

Considering the above cited judgments pertaining to Corroboration in this

case, the Senior Deputy Solicitor Generals position that the evidence given

by PW4, PW18 and PW20 corroborates the testimony of the prosecutrix

cannot be accepted as the evidence given by PW4, PW18 and PW20 is not

corroborative evidence. Although the Learned High Court Judge had

correctly observed that the prosecutrix had gone against her video evidence,

but misdirected himself by holding that her evidence had been corroborated

9 | P a g e

by the evidence of PW4, PW18 and PW20. But their evidence only shows the

consistency of the prosecutrixs evidence which certainly strengthens her

credibility. Therefore, I conclude that this ground of appeal has merit.

In the second ground of appeal, the Learned Presidents Counsel contends

that the prosecution had followed a totally illegal procedure when the

evidence of the prosecutrix was led before the court.

After tendering the video recorded testimony of the prosecutrix and before

the cross examination of the defence, the State Counsel made an application

to the trial court to lead some evidence in brief which had not been dealt in

the video recorded testimony of the prosecutrix. Although the Court had

granted permission to lead some evidence briefly, the State Counsel had led

lengthy evidence which might have been put in cross examination by the

defence. For this the State Counsel did not seek permission from the court

under Section 154 of the Evidence Ordinance. Further, nowhere the

prosecution had declared that the victim as a hostile witness.

Section 163 A (3) of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 32 of 1999

states:

Where a video recording is given in evidence under this section;

a) the child witness shall be called by the party who tendered the video

recording in evidence;

b) such child witness shall not be examined-in-chief on any matter

which in the opinion of the court, has been dealt with in his recorded

testimony.

Hence, the procedure adopted by the State Counsel in this case is

inappropriate which undoubtedly affect the fair trial which had been

mandated in the Constitution.

10 | P a g e

In Hattuwan Pedige Sugath Karunaratne v. The Attorney General SC

Appeal 32 of 2020 Aluwihare PC J., held that:

No doubt the duty of a State Counsel is to present the Prosecution in an

effective manner to the best of their ability in furtherance of securing a

conviction, if the evidence can support the charge. The Prosecutor,

however, is an officer of the court and their role is to assist the court to

dispense justice. Thus, it is not for a Prosecutor to ensure a conviction at

any cost, but to see that the truth is elicited, and justice is meted out. A

Prosecutor is not expected to keep out relevant facts either from the court

or from the accused. It the investigation has revealed matters which are

favourable to the Accused and the accused is unaware of the existence

of such facts, it is the bounden duty of the Prosecutor to make those

facts available to the court and to the defence.

Aluwihare PC J., held that:

I am mindful of the fact that the judges in criminal courts are burdened

with a heavy case load. That, however, does not excuse the trial judge

to not to follow the procedural steps stipulated by law or to disregard

the need to ensure that the accused is accorded a fair trial, guaranteed

by the Constitutional provisions and other laws.

Judges have a duty and are required to control the proceedings adhering

to the aforesaid requirements, and to intervene where necessary to

ensure the proceedings are conducted in a fair manner to all parties

concerned. In this respect the judges need to follow the proceedings

closely and should be alive to the events unfolding before him.

Not considering the guidance enumerated in the above-mentioned judgment

by His Lordship occasioned a fair trial failure in this case. Hence, this ground

of appeal also has merit.

11 | P a g e

As the grounds of appeal considered above have merits which certainly

disturb the judgment of the Learned High court judge, it is not necessary to

address the remaining ground of appeal further.

In this case the prosecution has failed to adduce corroborative evidence in

material particulars by evidence from an independent source which is, of

course, a statutory requirement under Section 163 A (5) of the Evidence

(Special Provisions) Act No.32 of 1999. Further irregular procedure had been

followed by the prosecution in violation of Section 163 A (3) (b) of the

Evidence (Special Provisions) Act, No.32 of 1999. As these are substantial

facts, it certainly affects the root of the case.

Considering all the circumstances discussed above, this court could only

come to the conclusion that the prosecution has not proven the case beyond

reasonable doubt. Therefore, the Appellant is acquitted from the charge.

The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside.

The Registrar of this court is directed to send a copy of this judgment along

with the original case record to the High Court of Colombo.
