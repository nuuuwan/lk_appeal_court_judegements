S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner to this Writ Application joined the Public Service in 1968 as a Clerk of

the General Clerical Service and he was promoted to the Supra Class of the General

Clerical Service with effect from 01.01.1984. Upon the formation of the Management

Assistants' Service, he was absorbed into the Supra Class of the Management

Assistants' Service with effect from 01.01.2004. Thereafter, based on the results of a

competitive examination, he was appointed as a Class III Officer of the Sri Lanka

Administrative Service with effect from 28.05.2006 by letter dated 20.06.2007 marked

as P6. Upon reaching the age of 60 years, the Petitioner retired from the public service

on 30.05.2006 while serving in the Department of Agriculture. After his retirement, by

the Public Administration Circular No. 6/2006 dated 25.04.2006 marked as P7A and

the Public Administration Circular No. 6/2006(iv) dated 24.08.2007 marked as P8 the

salary scales of the public service were restructured. It was the submission of the

learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner that the Petitioner has retired on

30.05.2006 and therefore, his salary scale should be amended as per P8 which came

into effect from 01.06.2007. On 25.06.2015 Public Administration Circular No.

16/2015 marked as P9 was issued revising the pensions of the public servants who

retired before the implementation of the P7A and P8. Thus, the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner argues that the Petitioner is entitled to a revision of his pension in terms of

P9. The Petitioner has written to relevant authorities requesting to amend his pension

as per the Circular marked as P9. By the letter dated 21.02.2019 marked as P26 the

Director General of Pensions (the 1st Respondent) informed the Petitioner that since he

had retired as an Officer in Class III of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service after being

placed in a salary step in the salary scale of SL 1-2006 which is applicable to the public

officers in the Sri Lanka Administrative Service, his pension cannot be revised in term

of P9 for the reason that SL 1-2006 salary scale has not been amended by the P8. By

the letter dated 03.07.2019 issued by the 1st Respondent marked as P29, the Petitioner

4

was informed that he is not entitled to a pension revision in terms of P9 for the reason

that the Petitioner belongs to the Sri Lanka Administrative Service and the applicable

salary scale to him in that Service had not been amended by P8. The position of the

Petitioner is that the aforementioned decisions of the Respondents not to revise his

monthly pension in terms of P9 is illegal, arbitrary, unreasonable, irrational and

capricious. By this writ Application, the Petitioner is seeking reliefs, inter alia, a writ

of Certiorari to quash the decisions contained in the documents marked as P29 and P26

and a writs of Mandamus directing the 1st- 4th Respondents to revise his pension in

terms of the Public Administration Circular marked as P9 based on the

recommendations of the National Salaries and Cadre Commission (5th Respondent)

marked as P15, P16, P22 and P23.

The Petitioner admits that his monthly salary is stipulated in terms of P7A restructuring

salaries in the public service. P7A was again amended by P8 increasing the salaries of

the public officers. The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner has drawn the

attention of the Court to the fact that when an Officer is promoted or appointed to a new

post, the salary after the new promotion/appointment must be decided in terms of

Section 5 of Chapter VII of the Establishment Code according to which such officer

being placed in a higher salary scale than his previous salary scale.

On that basis, the learned Counsel argued that the salary of the Petitioner in the Sri

Lanka Administrative Service should be decided based on the salary step applied to him

in the Supra Class of the Management Assistants Service which is the salary scale of

MN 7-2006. The contention of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the salary

scale of MN 7-2006 was amended by P8 and if the Petitioner was in service at the time

of introduction of P8, it would have resulted in him being placed on a higher salary step

in the salary scale of SL 01-2006 which was applied to him in the Sri Lanka

Administrative Service.

5

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner then argued that the Petitioner is entitled to have

his pension revised in terms of P9 which was issued to revise the pensions of the public

servants who retired before the implementation of P7A and P8. By letter dated

15.02.2016 marked as P11, the Petitioner requested from the Divisional Secretary of

Yatinuwara (the 2nd Respondent) to adjust his pension in terms of P9. By the letter

dated 24.05.2016 marked as P12, the Secretary Ministry of Public Administration (4th

Respondent) sought observations from the Secretary to the National Salaries and Cadre

Commission (the 5th Respondent) about the request made by the Petitioner to adjust his

pension in terms of P9. Responding to a letter dated 24.10.2016 of the 2nd Respondent

to get confirmed the salary of the Petitioner, the 5th Respondent, by letter dated

16.11.2016 marked as P15 informed the 2nd Respondent that the salary step which

should be applicable for calculation of the pension of the Petitioner is Rs. 30,675/. The

Petitioner states that even though, the 5th Respondent informed the 2nd Respondent to

revise his pension in terms of P9, no steps have been taken by the 2nd Respondent to

revise his pension in terms of P9. The Petitioner further states that even though, the 5th

Respondent, by letters dated 22.02.2017, 06.10.2017 and 06.12.2017 respectively

marked as P18, P22 and P23 informed the 2nd Respondent to revise his pension, no

steps had been taken by the 2nd Respondent. Thereafter, the Petitioner brought this

matter to the attention of the Director General of Establishment (the 3rd Respondent),

who referred the matter to the 4th Respondent by letter dated 19.07.2018 marked as P24.

As per the letter dated 13.08.2018 marked as P25, the Petitioner's pension file was

forwarded by the 2nd Respondent to the 1st Respondent seeking assistance to take a

decision. In the meantime, the 1st Respondent, by the letter dated 21.02.2019 marked as

P26 informed the 2nd Respondent that the Petitioner had retired as an Officer in Class

III of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service while being placed in the applicable salary

step to him in SL 01-2006 salary scale of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service and said

scale has not been amended by P8 and therefore, his pension cannot be revised in terms

of P9. By the letter dated 04.04.2019 marked as P27 addressed to the 1st Respondent,

6

the Petitioner explained the manner in which he falls within the provisions of P9.

However, by the letter dated 03.07.2019 marked as P29, the 1st Respondent refused to

revise the pension of the Petitioner in terms of P9 reiterating the same reasons

mentioned in P26.

According to the letter of appointment of the Petitioner to the Sri Lanka Administrative

Service marked as P9, the salary scale which was applied to the Petitioner when he

joined the Sri Lanka Administrative Service on 28.05.2006 is SL 01-2006 mentioned

in the Circular marked as P7A. He retired from the service on 30.05.2006 two days after

he was promoted to the Sri Lanka Administrative Service. The Circular marked as P7A

has been subsequently amended by the Circular marked as P8 revising the salaries of

the public officers. It has been stated in the Circular marked as P8 that it does not apply

to the public officers who come under the SL salary scales. Therefore, P8 is not

applicable to the Petitioner as his salary scale falls within the ambit of SL salary scales.

Moreover, P8 came into effect on 01.06.2007 revising the salaries of public officers

who were serving at the time it came into effect and by that time the Petitioner had

retired from his service.

In paragraph 53 of the written submissions dated 05.08.2022 filed on behalf of the

Petitioner, it has been admitted that P8 does not amend the SL salary scales applicable

to the Sri Lanka Administrative Service. However, the position of the learned Counsel

appearing for the Petitioner is that the Petitioner is entitled to a revision of his pension

in terms of P9 as his salary in the Sri Lanka Administrative Service was decided based

on his salary scale in Supra Class of the Management Assistants Service which was

amended by P8. The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner submitted to the Court

that, the Petitioner falls within the category of an officer stipulated in Clause 2.2() in

the Circular marked P9; which states that pensioners who have retired before

01.06.2007 from the posts relevant to the salary revised by the P.A.C.06/2006 (IV)

implemented from 01.06.2007, and receiving a pension based on the salary paid to

them under P.A. Circular 06/2006 implemented from 01.01.2006 up to 31.05.2007.

7

According to the aforementioned clause, it applies to the pensioners who retired before

01.06.2007 from the posts relevant to the salary scales which were revised by P8. Thus,

there is no applicability of this clause to the Petitioner even though, he had retired before

01.06.2007 as P8 does not amend the SL salary scale applicable to the Petitioner.

Consequently, there is no applicability of P9 to the Petitioner.

As a response to the request made by the Petitioner to adjust his pension, the 5th

Respondent issued letters marked as P15 (dated 16.11.2016), P16 (dated 13.11.2017),

P22 (dated 06.10.2017) and P23 (dated 06.12.2017) to the 2nd Respondent. By the letter

marked as P15, the 5th Respondent informed the 2nd Respondent, inter alia, that when

deciding the pension of the Petitioner, SL 1-2006 salary scale mentioned in P7A should

be considered as the applicable salary scale and the salary step which should be taken

into consideration for the purpose of deciding the pension is Rs. 30,675/-, which reads

thus;

By the letter dated 13.11.2017 marked as P16, correction has been made to the date of

retirement of the Petitioner mentioned in P15. In the letter marked as P22. The 5th

Respondent has reiterated the facts, inter alia, that in terms of P7A, the salary scale

which should be applicable to the officers in the Sri Lanka Administrative Service is

SL-1, that scale has not been amended by P8 and the Petitioners pension should be

decided as per the recommendations in P15 as follows;

The number of increments mentioned in P15 earned by the Petitioner has been amended

to read as 12 by the letter marked as P23 and it reiterates the facts mentioned in the

document marked as P15 in the following manner;

03. . . .

16/2015 III 12

.30,675/- .

The aforementioned letters have been issued by the 5th Respondent to the 2nd

Respondent regarding the request made by the Petitioner to amend his pension in terms

of P9. As evident by the said extracts it is clear that the 5th Respondent neither

recommended nor directed the 2nd Respondent to decide the Petitioners pension in

terms of P9 by those letters.

9

In terms of P7A, at the time of his retirement, the Petitioner has drawn a salary of Rs.

30,675/- as per the letter dated 31.07.2007 marked as P7 issued by the Department of

Agriculture (the 6th Respondent). The Petitioner does not argue that he was not placed

in that salary step when he was retired. By P15 it transpires the fact that when deciding

the pension of the Petitioner in terms of the Circular marked as P7A, his monthly salary

has been considered as Rs. 30,675/-. Therefore, the Court can be satisfied that in

deciding the pension, the Respondents had considered the Circular marked as P7A

which is applicable to the Petitioner. The Petitioner seeks a Writ of Certiorari to quash

the decision of the 1st Respondent contained in the documents marked as P26 and P29

not to revise his pension in terms of Circular marked as P9.

In Administrative Law by H. W. R. Wade and C. F. Forsyth (11th Edition)

characterizing writ of Certiorari states thus,

A quashing order issues to quash a decision which is ultra viresThe quashing order

looks to the past... Quashing and prohibiting orders are discretionary remedies, and

must be sought by the procedure of judicial review (at page 509)

The quashing order thus performs a function not unlike that of a declaratory judgement:

by quashing, the court declares that some purported decision or determination is

irregular or futile and therefore, of no effect in law. The result is to establish that no

one need take heed of it. The question at issue has not been lawfully determined, and

the responsible authority must start again and determine it properly (at page 516)

When considering the facts mentioned hereinbefore, this Court can be satisfied that the

Respondents have lawfully determined the pension of the Petitioner in terms of the

Circulars which should be applicable to the Petitioner. Therefore, the decisions of the

1st Respondent contained in the documents marked P26 and P29 are not illegal, ultra

vires, unreasonable or irregular. Therefore, the decision contained in P26 and P29 are

not liable to be quashed by way of a Writ of Certiorari.

10

The Petitioner seeks a Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to revise his

pension as per the Circular marked as P9. It is settled law that a Mandamus to issue,

the Petitioner must have a legal right and the Respondents must have a corresponding

public duty. In Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka Vs. Messers Jafferjee and

Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd1 the Supreme Court referred to the conditions that should be fulfilled

prior to issuance of a writ of mandamus.

There is rich and profuse case law on mandamus, on the conditions to be satisfied by

the applicant. Some of the conditions precedent to the issue of mandamus appear to be:

a) The applicant must have a legal right to the performance of a legal duty by the

parties against whom the mandamus is sought The foundation of mandamus is

the existence of a legal right.

b) The right to be enforced must be a public right and the duty sought to be

enforced must be of a public nature.

It was further stated by His Lordship Justice J.A.N. De Silva that,

Whether the facts show the existence of any or all pre-requisites to the granting of the

writ is a question of law in each case to be decided, not in any rigid or technical view

of the question, but according to a sound and reasonable interpretation. The court will

not grant a mandamus to enforce a right not of a legal but purely equitable nature

however extreme the inconvenience to which the applicant might be put.

Referring to the above case, in Kaluarachchi Vs Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and

Others2 Fernando J, stated that,

the foundation of mandamus is the existence of a legal right. A court should not grant

a Writ of Mandamus to enforce a right which is not legal and not based upon a public

duty.

1 2005 (1) SLR page 89.

2 SC Appeal No. 43/2013; SC Minutes of 19th June 2019.

11

It is evident from the above stated case laws that, a writ of mandamus to claim the

Petitioner must have a legal right and the Respondents should have a corresponding

public duty to perform towards the Petitioner. Since the Petitioner in the instant

application has no legal right to get his pension adjusted in terms of the P9 and the

Respondents have no public duty to adjust his pension as provided in P9 he is not

entitled to a writ of Mandamus.

On the other hand, the public servants are not entitled to pension as an absolute right

in terms of the regulations of the Minutes of Pension. In Gunawardena Vs. Attorney

General3 the Supreme Court held that, "It was contended, a Court of Law has no

jurisdiction in any matter relating to payment of pensions to retired government

servants, such matters depending entirely upon the grace and bounty of Crown. In my

opinion the Learned Commissioner's judgment upholding this objection was correct.

The payment of pensions to retired government servants at the relevant date was

regulated by certain rules sanctioned by the Secretary of State for Colonies and

incorporated in the Minutes of Pensions dated 05.02.1934. Rule 1 expressly provides

that public servants have no absolute right to any pension or allowance under these

rules. " This decision was followed in the case of Attorney General Vs. Abeysinghe4

which states thus,

"The expression' no absolute right to my mind means "no legal right" It is a signal

hoisted by the draftsman to indicate both to the beneficiaries under the Minutes of

Pensions and to the Courts that the Minutes are not to be taken as creating rights

enforceable in the courts. The "no legal right" concept contained in rule 1 of the

Minutes is then reinforced by the text of rules 2 and 15 which contain the expressions"

may be awarded" and "may in his discretion granted "Whilst concurring with the above

decision Tittawella J further observed, "I agree with the Chief Justice that the Minutes

3 47 NLR 359.

4 78 NLR 361.

12

on Pensions create no legal right in favour of a Public Servant and that the court have

no jurisdiction to entertain an action praying for a declaration in regard to his pension

and the date from which he should be paid. I also agree that in Sri Lanka there is no

constitution provision or any other provision of written law which has the effect of

altering the provisions of rule1 of the Minutes of Pension."

According to the said legal provisions the Petitioner does not have a right to demand to

adjust his pension in terms of P9. Under the above stated circumstances, the Petitioner

in the instant Application is not entitled to the writs prayed for in the Petition. Therefore,

the Court dismiss the writ Application. No costs ordered.

Application dismissed without costs.
