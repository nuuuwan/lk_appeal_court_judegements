JUDGMENT

The Petitioner-Appellant, who will be referred to as the Appellant, filed case No.

HCWA/12/2013 in the High Court of Hambantota seeking;

- An order to temporally suspend the order of eviction dated 18.11.2013 issued by the 1st

Respondent in par with Section 8 of the Agrarian Development Act No.46 of 2000.

- The issuance of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the effects of the order of eviction dated

18.11.2013 issued by the 1st Respondent in par with Section 8 of the Agrarian

Development Act.

- An order directing the 1st Respondent mandating the submissions of documents and

dockets relating to inquiry No. Pra/86/1129 and 42/Pra/Misc/Ambagaha Kumbura.

On notice, the Respondent appeared before the High Court and filed their objections. After

hearing both parties, the learned High Court Judge of Hambanthota rejected the Petition of the

Petitioner on 29th of August 2018. Aggrieved by that decision, the Appellant had come before

this Court. Both parties agreed to dispose of the case on written submissions filed.

The Petitioner and his father had possessed the land called Palle Beragama Badda alias

Ambagaha Kubura from 1974. In 1982 the said land was given to the 2nd Respondent by a grant

under Section 19(6), read with Section 19(4) of the Land Development Ordinance No.19 of

1935.

Thereafter the 2nd Respondent filed papers against the Appellants father seeking rent due for

yield as a tenant cultivator. After an inquiry, the 1st Respondent ordered the Appellants father to

pay LKR 14,595/- as the total payment. Aggrieved by this decision, the Appellants father had

filed case No.CA/873/88 and, by order dated 15.11.1995, was ordered to pay a sum of LKR

4865/- within a month.

On 12.06.1996, the 1st Respondent issued an eviction order ordering the Petitioners father to

vacate the land. Against this order, the Appellants father again went before the High Court and

was given time to pay within two weeks. Again, another order of eviction was issued by the 1st

Respondent on 18.11.2013 under Section 8 of the Agrarian Development Act. It was only after

that the Petitioner filed action No. HCWA/12/2013 at the High Court of Hambantota.

According to the Appellant, he is not a tenant cultivator as he and his father had enjoyed the land

from 1974. If the land belongs to the Appellant, he must clearly state how the land came to his

ownership or how the possession started. When the Appellants father agreed to pay a sum of

LKR 4865/- in case No.CA/873/88, he acknowledged that he was the tenant cultivator. There is

no indication to show that the Appellants father had acted to prove otherwise. Therefore, the

Appellant is estopped from saying he is not a tenant cultivator of the 2nd Respondent.

Section 6(4) of the Agrarian Development Act No.46 of 2000 read as follows: -

Where any person who is a permit holder holding an extent of paddy land upon a permit

issued under the land Development Ordinance subject to the condition that such permit

holder himself shall cultivate such extent of paddy land, leases out such extent of paddy

land to a person who cultivates such extent of paddy land the person so cultivating shall

not be deemed to be a tenant cultivator within the meaning of this Act.

Since the 2nd Respondent is not a permit holder, he has been granted the land. Therefore, the

above Section will not be applicable to the 2nd Respondent. The Appellants argument based on

this Section fails. At the time of CA/873/88, the Appellant should have argued this issue. In case

No.CA873/88, the Judges of the Court of Appeal had stated;

The Petitioner is directed to pay the rent for the Maha season of 1985/86 within one

month of the communication of this order, and if he fails to do so, the Commissioner of

Agrarian Services is free to take further proceedings regarding the Petitioner under the

provisions of the Agrarian Act.

This indicates that the Appellant cannot now deny that he is a tenant cultivator. The Appellant

had not shown to this Court that there was any other judgment against the judgment mentioned

above.

In the same judgment, there is enough material to show that there had been an inquiry in which

the Appellants father had participated. The learned Judge of the Court of Appeal had observed

that;

After the proceedings, on 08.01.1988, the Petitioner was directed to hand over the

documents relied upon by him, and since he failed to do so, further notice dated

24.02.1986 directing him to submit the documents was sent out but has failed to comply

with that direction.

This indicates that the 1st Respondent gave the Appellants father a fair hearing. The judgment

of CA873/88 had discussed this issue at length. Therefore, the argument of the Appellant fails

regarding natural justice.

The learned High Court Judge had observed the orders and judgments of CA/873/88, HCA 25/96

of High Court of Hambanthota, L2559 of the District Court of Hambantota and concluded that

the matter before the Court is already decided (Res judicata).

When the Appellant knew of all the above cases, which his father primarily filed, he should have

known that he had no legal right to come on the same issue again. Therefore, we hold that the

Appellant had not come before the Court with clean hands.

For the reasons discussed above, we dismiss the appeal with a cost fixed at LKR 25,000/=.

Judge of the Court of Appeal
