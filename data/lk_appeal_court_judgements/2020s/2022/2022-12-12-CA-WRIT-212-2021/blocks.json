As such in terms of Section 72 of the Land Ordinance, the title to the impugned land should devolve to the eldest son of Kirimenika. It is on the common ground that the 4th Respondent Ranbanda is the son of Kirimenika from her previous marriage. Therefore the eldest son of Kirimenika is the 4th Respondent. Mere fact that the permit holder or the owner contracted a second marriage may not presume that her/his legitimate children from her/his first marriage shall lose their succession rights. The Petitioner has submitted the Birth Certificate of the 4th Respondent marked as P8. Despite, the fact that the said 4th Respondent is the son of Kirimenika from her first marriage, it is on common ground that the 4th Respondent is the son(eldest) of Kirimenika. In such circumstances, the 4th Respondent gets priority over succession rights as the eldest living son of the Kirimenika. Therefore, I see no reason for the Petitioner to challenge the decision of the 1st Respondent",
