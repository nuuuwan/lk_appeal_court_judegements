Judgment

It appears that the Officer in Charge of the Police Station, Kandy being the

complainant, had filed an information on 12.12.2018 in terms of Section 66(1) of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, due to a breach of the peace

threatened or likely to be threatened between the 1st Party Respondents and the 2nd

Party Respondents over obstructing a footpath used by the 1st Party Respondent to

access her house.

After the intervention of the 2nd Party Intervenient Respondents, all parties filed

their respective affidavits and counter affidavits and parties agreed to dispose the

inquiry by way of written submissions. Subsequently, the parties had filed their

written submissions and the learned Magistrate acting as a Primary Court Judge had

delivered the order on 24.06.2019 in favour of the 1st Party Respondents.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the 2nd Party Respondent-Petitioner had invoked

the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Central Province

holden in Kandy seeking to set aside or revise the said order made by the learned

Magistrate.

However, it is seen that the learned High Court Judge held the order of the learned

Magistrate is well founded and that there is no necessity to intervene in the

impugned order. Hence, the application for revision was dismissed with cost. Being

aggrieved by the determination of the learned High Court Judge, the 2nd Party

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant had preferred this appeal to this Court.

It appears that the Appellant had taken up the position in this appeal that

jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court is not invoked properly. In this respect, it was

submitted that jurisdictional objection has to be taken up at the earliest possible

opportunity and that the Appellant is precluded from taking up such an objection at

Page 6 of 14

this stage. However, the Appellant had preferred this appeal against the order made

by the learned High Court Judge exercising revisionary jurisdiction.

It is settled law that to exercise revisionary powers against the order challenged,

the impugned order must be manifestly erroneous, which goes beyond an error,

defect or irregularity that occasions to a miscarriage of justice which tends to shock

the conscience of Court.

As per Chapter VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, there is no right of appeal

given against an order. It appears that the Appellant had invoked the revisionary

jurisdiction of the High Court against the order of the learned Magistrate acting as

a Primary Court Judge in terms of Section 69(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act No. 44 of 1979.

It was held in the case of Nandawathi and another Vs. Mahindasena [2009] 2 SLR

218,

When an order of a Primary Court Judge is challenged by way of revision in

the High Court, the High Court can exercise only the legality of that order and

not the correction of that order.

It was emphasized by Ranjith Silva J. in the following manner;

I am of the opinion that this particular right of appeal in the circumstances

should not be taken as an appeal in the true sense, but in fact as an

application to examine the correctness, legality or the propriety of the order

made by the High Court Judge in the exercise of revisionary powers. The Court

of Appeal should not under the guise of an appeal attempt to re-hear or re-

evaluate the evidence led in the main case.

It was highlighted in the case of Bandulasena and others Vs. Galla Kankanamge

Chaminda Kushantha and others CA (PHC) 147/2005 [CA minutes

27.09.2017];

It would be relevant to bear in mind that the appeal before this Court is an

appeal against a judgment pronounced by the Provincial High Court in

exercising its revisionary jurisdiction. Thus, the task before this Court is not

to consider an appeal against the Primary Court order but to consider an

Page 7 of 14

appeal in which an order pronounced by the Provincial High Court in the

exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction is sought be impugned.

Thus, it is apparent that under the guise of this appeal, the Appellant is not entitled

to have the value of evidence placed before court re-heard or re-valued, which

entirely falls within the domain of the jurisdiction of the Primary Court.

Since this appeal is preferred against the order made by the learned High Court

Judge exercising revisionary jurisdiction, the Court of Appeal is empowered to

evaluate the correctness of the order made by the High Court exercising revisionary

jurisdiction.

The Provincial High Court should have been mindful when exercising revisionary

jurisdiction in respect of the application made against the orders of the Magistrates

Court that this application is a revision application and not an appeal.

It is observable that the Appellant in his written submissions had taken up an

objection in respect of the jurisdiction of the Primary Court [Magistrates Court of

Kandy] at the appeal stage and also proposed as to why the learned Primary Court

Judge should have declared the entitlement of the impugned right of way in his

favour.

In Nandawathi and another Vs. Mahindasena [supra], which stated that the right

given to an aggrieved party to right of appeal in terms of Article 154 (3) b of the

Constitution against an order of the High Court in a revision applications, should not

be considered as an appeal in the true sense. The Court of Appeal is restricted in its

scope and really have the power only to examine the propriety or the legality of the

order made by the learned High Court Judge in the exercising of its revisionary

jurisdiction.

It is to be noted that, it was the contention of the 1st Party Respondents that they

are entitled to use the disputed foot path, which is described in the 3rd Schedule of

their affidavits dated 23.01.2019.

Page 8 of 14

Since the dispute was relating to a foot path, it is clear that the dispute between

the parties comes within the purview of Section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act.

Section 69 stipulates that;

(1) Where the dispute relates to any right to any land or any part of a land,

other than the right to possession of such land or part thereof, the Judge of

the Primary Court shall determine as to who is entitled to the right which is

the subject of the dispute and make an order under subsection (2).

(2) An order under this subsection may declare that any person specified

therein shall be entitled to any such right in or respecting the land or in any

part of the land as may be specified in the order until such person is deprived

of such right by virtue of an order or decree of a competent court, and

prohibit all disturbance or interference with the exercise of such right by such

party other than under the authority of an order or decree as aforesaid.

On behalf of the Appellants, the case Ramalingam Vs. Thanagarajah [1982] 2 SLR

693 was cited;

On the other hand, if the dispute is in regard to any right to any land other

than right of possession of such land, the question for decision, according to

Section 69(1), is who is entitled to the right which is subject of dispute. The

word entitle here connotes the ownership of the right. The Court has to

determine which of the parties has acquired that right, or is entitled for the

time being to exercise that right. In contradistinction to Section 68, Section

69 requires the Court to determine the question which party is entitled to the

disputed right preliminary to making an order under Section 69(2).

Furthermore, the attention of Court was drawn to the case of Ananda Sarath

Paranagama Vs. Dhamadinna Sarath Paranagama CA (PHC) 117/2013 [C.A.M.

12.12.2013], which observed that there are two ways in which the existence of

such a road way can be proved in the Primary Court, They are;

1. By adducing proof of the entitlement as is done in a Civil Court,

2. By offering proof that he is entitled to the right for the time being.

Page 9 of 14

It was further held that, if you described a party as being entitled to enjoy a right

but for the time being, it means that it will be like that for a period of time, but

may change in the future (emphasis added).

It was submitted on behalf of the Appellants that, in the circumstances it is clear

that the Respondents were required to establish that they had an

ownership/entitlement to the said right of way or right to use the said foot path.

However, it was the contention of the Appellant that the Respondents had failed to

establish any entitlement to the purported right of way to use the foot path which

is necessary to obtain an order in terms of Section 69(2) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act. As such, the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge

have erred in law by failing to identify the fundamental purpose of the Legislature

in enacting Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, which is to preserve

the peace.

The learned High Court Judge has observed that since no party disputed the pathway

described in the 3rd Schedule of the affidavit of the Respondents, the learned

Magistrate had properly identified the disputed pathway and correctly decided the

matter in terms of Section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

It is worthy to note that the learned High Court Judge had stated in the order that;

It clearly manifests that the complaint made by the Respondents to the Police

Station, Kandy falls within the purview of Section 69 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act which read as follows;

(1) Where the dispute relates to any right to any land or any part of a land,

other than the right to possession of such land or part thereof, the Judge of

the Primary Court shall determine as to who is entitled to the right which is

the subject of the dispute and make an order under subsection (2).

In view of Section 75 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, it defines a dispute

affecting a land as follows;

dispute affecting land includes any dispute as to the right to the possession

of any land or part of a land and the buildings thereon or the boundaries

thereof or as to the right to cultivate any land or part of a land, or as to the

right to the crops or produce of any land, or part of a land, or as to any right

in the nature of a servitude affecting the land and any reference to land in

this part includes a reference to any building standing thereon.

The case of Tudor Vs. Anulawathi and another [1993] 3 SLR 235 at 245,

explained the scope of an order that could be made in terms of Section 69 of the

Act.

According to Section 69 (1) and 69 (2), after an inquiry,

a) the learned Primary Court Judge has to determine as to who is entitled to the

right.

b) make an order that the person specified therein shall be entitled to such right

until such person is deprived of that right by virtue of an order or decree of a

competent court.

c) prohibit all interferences with or disturbances of that right other than under

the authority of an order or decree.

Page 11 of 14

The Respondents had to establish that they are entitled to the use of the impugned

foot path as a servitudanal right as opposed to the mere use of that servitude.

It was discussed in the case of Ramalingam Vs. Thanagarajah [supra], according

to Section 69(1), is who is entitled to the right which is subject of dispute. The word

entitle here connotes the ownership of the right. The Court has to determine

which of the parties has acquired that right, or is entitled for the time being to

exercise that right.

It was stated by the Appellant that the 1st Respondent has an alternative road way

to enter their premises. However, Primary Court may not have considered the

availability of an alternative right of way, if there was any, to deny the right of way

used by the Respondents over the disputed portion of land, when making an Order

under Section 69 (2) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

Since the dispute between the parties is relating to a roadway, it appears that

Section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act is applicable and according to

Section 69 of the Act, there is no necessity to consider the availability of an

alternative roadway.

The learned Primary Court Judge had determined that the 1st and 3rd Respondents

had not proved the fact that the roadway was used for more than 10 years, and

thereby as not being entitled to claim their ownership by way of prescription. The

learned Primary Court Judge has further stated that even the 3rd Petitioner had not

established her rights to use the disputed roadway.

By virtue of Section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, there is no need to

prove rights as it is done in a civil suit. The case Ramalingam Vs. Thanagarajah

[supra] held the following;

On the other hand, if the dispute is in regard to any right to any land other

than right of possession of such land, the question for decision, according to

Section 69(1) is, who is entitled to the right which is subject of dispute. The

word entitle here connotes the ownership of the right. The Court has to

determine which of the parties has acquired that right or is entitled for the

time being to exercise that right. In contradiction to Section 68 of the Act,

Page 12 of 14

Section 69 requires the court to determine the question as to which party is

entitled to the disputed right of way prior to the making of an order under

Section 69(2).

It was held in the aforementioned case that the entitlement can be proved in the

Primary Court by adducing proof of the entitlement as done in a Civil Court or by

offering proof that he is entitled to the right for the time being.

The said contention was analyzed by Justice A.W.A. Salam in the case titled Ananda

Sarath Paranagama Vs. Dhamadinna Sarath Paranagama [supra], in which

Salam J. emphasized of the need to understand that the proof of acquisition of the

right is totally different from proving the enjoyment/existence of the right at the

time the dispute arose.

It has been held in the case of Punchi Nona Vs. Padumasena and Others [1994] 2

SLR 117, that the Primary Court exercising special jurisdiction under Section 66 of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act, is not involved in an investigation into the title,

right to possession or entitlement, which are functions of a Civil Court. What the

Primary Court is required to do is to take a preventive action and make a provisional

order pending final adjudication of rights of the parties in a Civil Court.

The attention of Court was drawn to the police observation report. It reveals that

the 1st Respondent and her family members have used the disputed roadway for an

extensive period of time. Furthermore, the said report states that the said roadway

in dispute has been shut off by a fence and was further blocked with the use of

coconut leaves. The report further goes on to say that the neighbours of the 1st

Respondent has used the roadway in dispute to reach the 1st Respondents house.

The Appellant has also given a statement to Police objecting to 1st Respondents the

use of the disputed roadway.

The observation report produced by the police contains the following, and shows

that the Respondents to this case has used this roadway.

10 .

.

Page 13 of 14

.

In view of the aforesaid observation notes of the Police Officer, it amply proves that

the Respondent has been using the disputed roadway as a right by way of necessity,

to lot L, to the 1st Respondents house.

According to Section 75, it mandates the Primary Court to deal with a dispute in

the nature of servitude and need not touch upon servitude per se. The Primary

Courts (Magistrates Court) are precluded from dealing with matters described in

Schedule 04 of the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978. The excluded matters inter alia;

Any action for a declaratory decree including a decree for the declaration of

title of a land (item 12) in the 4th Schedule.

For obstruction to or interference with the enjoyment of any servitude or the

exercise of any right over property (item 24 (i)).

In civil cases, right of way can be established as a servitudanal right by prescription

or by way of necessity. It was held in Sumangala Vs. Appuhamy 46 NLR 131 that a

servitude, such as a right of foot path must be established by cogent evidence, as it

affects the land owners right to a free and unfettered use of land.

The attention of Court was drawn to the case of Ananda Sarath Paranagama Vs.

Dhamadinna Sarath Paranagama [supra] which dealt with the interpretation of

the word entitlement. It appears that a party does not need to establish a

servitudanal right by cogent evidence as is usually considered in a Civil Court. The

required proof of the users right in terms of Section 69 (1) of the Act, is to consider

a right in the nature of a servitude or long term use. Thus, proving the enjoyment

of the right at the time of the dispute arose is sufficient.

Therefore, it is clear that the learned High Court judge had analyzed and evaluated

the evidence placed before the Primary Court and also applied the relevant law, and

had affirmed the order of the learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary

Court Judge. Thus the Order of the learned High Court judge is well founded.

In view of the findings of the learned High Court Judge, the Appellants had not

disclosed exceptional circumstances, which would warrant the intervention of the

Provincial High Court by way of an application for revision.

Page 14 of 14

Thus, it clearly manifests that the learned High Court Judge had correctly affirmed

the Order of the learned Magistrate and had dismissed the Appellants application

for revision. As such, we see no reason for us to interfere with the Order dated

08.01.2020 by the learned High Court Judge and the Order dated 24.06.2019 by the

learned Magistrate.

Hence, we dismiss the appeal with cost fixed at Rs. 50,000/-.
