The trial commenced before the High Court Judge as the Appellant had opted

for a non-jury trial. The prosecution had called 08 witnesses, marked the

deposition of a deceased witness under Section 33 of Evidence Ordinance,

marked the productions P1-P15 and closed the case. As the prosecutions

case warranted a case to answer, the learned High Court Judge had called

for the defence and the Appellant had made a dock statement. After

considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High Court

Judge had convicted the Appellant on charges 1,3,4,5 and 6 and acquitted

the Appellant on charges 2 and 7. For count number 1 the Appellant was

sentenced to death under Section 296 of the Penal Code on 14/05/2018. For

the counts 3,4,5 and 6 the Appellant was sentenced to 10 years rigorous

imprisonments for each count which are to run concurrently. In addition,

the learned High Court Judge had imposed a fine of Rs.10,000/- for each

count with a default sentence of 02 years rigorous imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in their absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellant was connected via

Zoom platform from prison.

The Learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the Appellant has advanced

a singular ground of appeal that is, that the Learned Trial Judge had not

analysed the principles of Common Intention accurately and the prosecution

has therefore failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.

Background of the Case albeit briefly is as follows:

In this case the prosecution had called 04 lay witnesses and marked the

deposition of PW1 under section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance.

5 | P a g e

In the evidence of PW1 it revealed that he had managed a small temple in

which to perform rituals intended to ward off demons and evil spirits from

an individual or a location. As usual after attending to his clients he had

closed his temple for the public and had been making his way to his house

which is also situated on the same premises when two persons had

approached him with the intention of getting a king coconut blessed. The

time was between 11.30-12.00 mid night on 05/05/1992. Both have had

helmets in their possession. Suddenly, the Appellant accusing PW1 of being

a bogus ritual performer, pushed the witness in to a small boutique and

demanded his gold chain which he usually wore. At that time however, PW1

has not been wearing the chain as he had removed it after work. Due to the

commotion that ensued, his sons, daughter and his sister had rushed to the

scene immediately. The Appellant had then threatened the witness with an

object resembling a bomb and the other person had been armed with a pistol.

The other person too had demanded gold jewellery from the witness. The

Appellant was standing close to the boutique while the others had stood few

steps away from the witness. Then the Appellant had demanded PW1s

sisters gold chain and had proceeded to remove it. At that time when this

witness had tried to restrain the Appellant, the deceased had come out from

his house to save him. Suddenly the other person who had possessed a gun

opened fire on the deceased and he had fallen to the ground. As the place of

incident was properly lit up with bright lights, he had been able to witness

the sequence of events very clearly. When the Appellant along with other

person tried to escape after the shooting, the people in the area had

apprehended the Appellant and had proceeded to hand him over to the police

with the motor bike and the two helmets that had been in the possession of

the two perpetrators.

During cross examination this witness had said that when he grabbed the

Appellant the other person had threatened him to release the Appellant.

6 | P a g e

PW2 is the brother of the deceased who too had rushed towards the

commotion that day. When he reached the place, he had seen the Appellant

keep a small round object on the table and heard him shout out that he was

from the STF (Special Task Force) and would destroy everything. At that time

the other person who possessed a pistol had told him to rob the house while

he was on guard. At that time the Appellant had removed his gold chain and

PW3s chain forcefully. Then his father PW1 had scuffled with the Appellant

and at that moment the deceased had rushed to the place whereupon the

other person had shot at him.

According to PW3, the sister of the deceased, when she went there, she had

seen the Appellant and the other person who had then proceeded to brandish

a pistol. Immediately thereafter, she had heard the sound of a gun. At the

same time the other person who was carrying the pistol had snatched her

chain and run away. The people could only apprehend the Appellant at that

time. She too had travelled to the hospital along with the deceased as she

also has had injuries on one of her hands.

PW5, sister of PW1, in her evidence had stated that she rushed to the place

on hearing a mention about the STF. At the scene, she had seen a person

standing there who was brandishing a pistol. He had threatened the witness

with the gun and ordered her to remove her gold chain and had it over to the

Appellant. Out of fear, she had complied with his command. After hearing

the gunfire, she had lost consciousness. She too confirmed that the

Appellant held an object similar to a ball in his hand.

PW16, the investigating officer had reached the place of incident around

00.15 hours on 06/05/1992. He had arrested the Appellant who was

injured. He had observed the place of incident and recovered a motor bike

bearing No.118-8550, one spent and one live cartridge, two live hand bombs

of which one was of local make, a helmet, a pair of spectacles and a wrist

watch. The Appellant had been apprehended by the people of the area at the

crime scene and they had proceeded to hand him over to the police.

7 | P a g e

As mentioned above, the learned Presidents Counsel has advanced in his

argument that the learned Trial Judge has failed to analyse the principles of

Common Intention accurately and thereby the prosecution had failed to

prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.

The concept of Common Intention and its applicability has been discussed

in depth in several important judgments by local courts. Hence, I consider,

it is important to discuss this concept before resolving the grievance of the

Appellant.

Common Intention is depicted under Section 32 of the Penal Code of Sri

Lanka. It reads:

When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the

common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in

the same manner as if it were done by him alone.

Common Intention implies a pre-arranged plan and acting in concert

pursuant to the plan. Common Intention comes into being prior to the

commission of the act, but a long gap in time need not be present. To bring

this section into effect a pre-concert is not necessary to be proved, but it may

well develop on the spot as between a number of persons and could be

inferred from the facts and circumstances of each case.

In The Queen v. Mahatun 61 NLR 540 the court held that:

Under section 32 of the Penal Code, when a criminal act is committed

by one of several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all,

each of them is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done

by him alone. If each of several persons commits a different criminal act

each act being in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of them

is liable for each such as if it were done by him alone.

To establish the existence of a common intention it is not essential to

prove that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to a pre-

8 | P a g e

arranged plan. A common intention can come into existence without pre-

arrangement. It can be formed on the spur of the moment.

In Wimalasena v. IP Hambantota 74 NLR 176 the court held that:

Mere presence of an accused person is not sufficient to establish

common intention within the meaning of section 32 of the Penal Code.

In S. Fernando v. H. De Silva 68 NLR 166 the court held that:

In order to sustain the charge based on common intention it is essential

that both the accused persons must have participated in the offence, in

the sense that they must be physically present at or about the scene of

offence.

Although the accused did not commit any physical act, yet liability could be

imposed on him on the basis that his presence was a participatory presence.

All these are generally established through circumstantial evidence.

In King v. Assappu 50 NLR 324 the court held that:

In a case where the question of common intention arises the Jury must be

directed that-

(i) the case of each accused must be considered separately.

(ii) the accused must have been actuated by a common intention with the

doer of the act at the time the offence was committed,

(iii) common intention must not be confused with same or similar intention

entertained independently of each other,

(iv) there must be evidence, either direct or circumstantial, of pre-

arrangement or some other evidence of common intention,

9 | P a g e

(v) the mere fact of the presence of the accused at the time of the offensive

is not necessarily evidence of common intention.

It may also be added that for a charge of murder, it is imperative that the

accused entertained a murderous intention along with the perpetrator of the

offending act.

With the guidance of the above cited judicial decisions, now I consider the

singular ground of appeal advanced in this case by the Appellant.

PW1 in his evidence stated that when he was confronted by the Appellant

and the other person, the Appellant threatening him with an object

resembling a hand bomb, had demanded his gold chain that he usually

wears daily. At that time the other person who possessed a gun had also

inquired the witness where his gold jewelleries were. When the deceased

rushed to the place the unknown person had opened fire at the deceased.

PW1 also stated that both the Appellant and the other person had come in a

motor bike and the helmets were on the table. When PW1 grappled with the

Appellant, the other person had threatened him to let the Appellant go.

According to PW2, when he too had rushed to the scene upon hearing the

commotion, the Appellant had threatened him with an object resembling a

hand bomb and had removed his gold chain. At that time the other person

who possessed a gun told the Appellant to clean the house while he stands

guard there. When his father managed to come out from the boutique, he

had seen the other person shooting at the deceased.

When PW3 arrived at the scene, she had seen the Appellant and another

person, and the latter had been in possession of a gun. At that time the other

person had opened fire and run away after snatching her gold chain.

PW5 in her evidence stated that when she arrived at the scene, the person

who possessed the gun held her on gun point and demanded her gold chain.

At that time the Appellant had forcibly removed her gold chain. During cross

examination she had said that the person who was standing outside the

10 | P a g e

boutique had ordered her to give the gold chain to the person who was inside

the boutique. However, according to PW1, PW2 and PW3 at that time the

appellant was the person who was inside the boutique threatening PW1 with

an object like a hand bomb.

Analysing the sequence of events described by the lay witnesses, the

Appellant and the other person had come together to the temple, threatened

the witnesses with dangerous weapons, robbed gold jewelleries from

witnesses and shot at the deceased in furtherance of common intention. The

weapons they possessed and the way that both had behaved clearly indicate

that they had common intention in committing the crime. Further, carrying

deadly weapons and using them to frighten the witnesses and killing the

deceased clearly established their common murderous intention at the time

of committing the offence.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant citing the judgment of

Somaratna v. Attorney General [1986] 1 SLR 217 submitted that the

Learned High Court Judge has not considered common intention in his

judgment. In this judgment the court held that:

The conviction of the appellant on the basis of his having

entertained a common intention along with the other accused

cannot stand as the Judge had failed to discuss this rule and

apply it to the facts of the case. The prosecution must prove the

essentials ingredients of common intention namely a sharing of a

common intention and participation in the commission of the

offences.

Where the prosecution relies on circumstantial evidence for

common intention then the principle is that the inference of

common intention should not be reached unless it is a necessary

inference, an only inference, an inference from which there is no

escape. Failure to apply these tests will make the conviction on

11 | P a g e

the inference that the appellant had acted in furtherance of a

common intention unsustainable.

The Learned High Court Judge, in his judgment has accurately analysed the

evidence presented by both parties and arrived at the conclusion that the

Appellant with another person unknown to the prosecution had jointly

committed the offence as charged in the indictment.

In this case the prosecution had led incriminating evidence of both direct

and circumstantial in nature against the Appellant and the circumstances

established were consistent with the Appellants guilt. Hence, I proceed to

dismiss his appeal.

Appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court

of Colombo along with the original case record.
