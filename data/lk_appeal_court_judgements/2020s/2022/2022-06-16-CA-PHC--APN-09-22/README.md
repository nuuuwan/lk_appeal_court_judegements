The instant application has been filed to aside the order dated 10.01.2022 of High

Court of Colombo.

Page 5 of 8

The Suspect petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) has been taken in

to custody for the death of his own father on a complaint lodged by his own elder

brother on 11.9.2021.

According to the material submitted by both parties the death of the deceased had

taken place on 9.6,2017 in the office of the deceased. The deceased has had a

business by the name of Adam Expo in which the deceased the petitioner and the

complainant had been partners.

On 9.6.2017 the deceased had gone to his office in the morning and the petitioner

had gone to see the father and thereafter around 12 noon the petitioner had

informed the people outside that the his father had collapsed and he had been

rushed to hospital by the two sons of the deceased, and the deceased had been in

an unconscious state and he had been pronounced dead by the hospital authorities.

The Coroner had certified that the deceased death was due to natural causes and he

had been cremated as per his religious believes.

But the intervenient petitioner suspected foul play with regard to the death of his

father by the petitioner and had lodged a complaint with the Director Criminal

Investigations Department on 26.9.2018.

The intervenient petitioner brings in to light of a probable motive for the petitioner

to have killed his own father by submitting a forged board paper in which the

signatures of the deceased, the complainant and the brother of the deceased is

supposed to have been forged, in order to obtain a loan of Rs 20 million from a

financial institute.

As the loan had needed to be restructured due to arrears of installments, the

financial institute had contacted the deceased just prior to the death, witnessed by

Page 6 of 8

his daughter in law, and the deceased on a subsequent date is supposed to have had

a heated argument over the incident with the petitioner, again overheard by the

same daughter in law.

Thereafter on the day of the incident the bank officials had been waiting to meet the

deceased when the petitioner had gone to meet the deceased after which the

collapsing in office had taken place.

As such facts were reported to the Magistrates Court and the body had been

exhumed and a post mortem had been held by a panel of judicial medical officers.

The office assistant of the deceased had made a statement to the police stating that

on the day of the incident the deceased had come to office as usual and the

petitioner had come to see him and the above named Chaminda had been standing

near the door not allowing anybody to go inside and later the petitioner had come

out shouting that the deceased had collapsed and all had run inside to see the

deceased fallen and Chaminda trying to recuperate him. The deceased had been

bleeding from the mouth and the nose.

The same had been said by the private sectary to the deceased.

As such the Attorney General has submitted that the CID is currently investigating

the complaint and the financial institutes are yet to produce the necessary

documents and the CCTV footages of the office of the deceased are yet to be

analyzed by the Government Analyst and certain telephone records are yet to be

submitted to Court.

The Attorney General has further alleged that the report of the Coroner is

questionable because it has been issued without the Coroner seeing the body.

The said Chaminda and his mother had been threatened over the phone and the said

calls are being investigated.

Hence the Attorney General objected for bail being granted to the petitioner and

averred that there is no illegality in the order of the learned High Court Judge.

The petitioner alleged that there is an inordinate delay in the proceedings against

the petitioner and the petitioner had been falsely implicated by the complainant.

In the order of the High Court the learned High Court Judge he had considered the

fact that since the investigations are yet to be concluded, granting bail to the

petitioner might not do justice to all parties and he had referred to section 14(a) (ii)

of the Bail Act nu 30 1997 which says asinterfere with the witnesses or the evidence

against him or otherwise obstruct the course of justice.

Upon perusal of submissions of all parties it is quite clear that the complaint of the

intervenient complaint is belated but the facts pertaining to the complaint needs to

be investigated and the facts so far revealed upon the latest investigations are very

clear that further investigation is very much needed. As such belatedness of the

complaint can be gone in to at trial stage.

Therefore it is the opinion of this Court that upon the material so far revealed the

instant matter is not yet fully investigated and the learned High Court Judge in

concluding that in order for justice to be dispensed to all parties that granting of bail

can hamper the investigations is not illegal nor shocks the conscious of this Court in

order to invoke the revisionary powers of this Court.

It is a well-established principle of law that when a party files a revision application

the party filling the same must that demonstrate that there are illegalities in the

impugned order which shocks the conscious of this Court.

But in the instant matter we do not see such instances and as such the instant

application to set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge is hereby

dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

Neil Iddawala J.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
