DECIDED ON : 10.03.2022

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. The first Accused-appellant together with the second accused was

indicted in the High Court of Kegalle for having committed the following

offences.

i. On or about 20.04.2005, committing the offence

punishable under Section 140 of the Penal Code, being

a member of an unlawful assembly in which the

common object was a robbery.

ii. Committing the murder, the offence punishable under

section 296 of the Penal Code read with Section 146 of

the same as a member of an unlawful assembly.

iii. Committing the robbery, the offence punishable under

Section 380 of the Penal Code read with Section 146 of

the same as a member of an unlawful assembly.

3

iv. Committing the offence of murder punishable under

Section 296 of the Penal Code read with Section 32.

v. Committing the offence of robbery punishable under

Section 380 of the Penal Code read with Section 32.

Accordingly, the first, second and third charges are based on unlawful

assembly. The fourth and fifth charges are based on common intention.

Prosecution evidence discloses about three or four persons involvement

in the crime. No witness has stated more than four persons

involvement. In such circumstances, first, second and third counts

have been brought without any basis.

The learned High Court Judge acquitted the 2nd accused from all five

charges. The first accused-appellant was convicted for the 4th and 5th

counts and a ten-year sentence for the 5th count and death sentence for

the 4th count were imposed. The 1st accused-appellant preferred this

appeal against the said conviction and sentence. At the hearing of the

appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant and the

learned Senior State Counsel for the respondent made oral

submissions. Prior to the hearing, both parties tendered their written

submissions.

Briefly, the facts relating to the case are as follows. The Incident took

place in a betting center namely Sporting Times located on the first

floor of a building. The floor was divided into two parts. Managers room

and satellite room were in one part and the other part was for the

customers. Four persons entered the manager's room through the door

which was open for the cashier to leave. Thereafter, those persons

forcibly opened the safe and took the money. The deceased was also

inside that room. One of the persons shot at the deceased. At the same

time, the receiver of the land phone was pulled out and it was thrown

away. After the building was locked while the other employees,

4

including the deceased, were inside the building, those persons left the

premises.

When the defence was called after the prosecution case was closed, the

appellant made a dock statement and stated that On the date, I went

to the betting center, there was a commotion at this place and the

telephone was fallen down. Thereafter, I kept it on the table.

The contentions of the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant

were based on the following three main grounds.

1. A common murderous intention on the part of the appellant had

not been proved by the prosecution.

2. The circumstantial evidence against the appellant was not

properly evaluated.

3. The learned High Court judge failed to evaluate the contradictions

in prosecution witnesses.

Although the aforesaid grounds are stated in the written submissions

tendered on behalf of the appellant, the learned Presidents Counsel did

not make submissions regarding contradictions. However, in the

written submission, it was mentioned that PW 18 had stated that the

telephone receiver was found under the table of the cashier and PW 15

stated that PW 18 had told him that the telephone receiver was found

in the managers room. Although, this has been pointed out as a

contradiction, PW 15 has said that he stayed outside of the premises

until PW 18 entered the crime scene. Furthermore, PW 15 clearly stated

that he did not know exactly where the receiver was and PW 18 told

him that the receiver was on the floor of the managers room. In

addition, PW 2 stated while describing the incident, that the cashiers

table was in the managers room (page 110 of the appeal brief).

Therefore, it is clear that there is no contradiction between the evidence

of PW 18 and PW 15 on that point.

5

First, I proceed to consider whether the conviction for the 5th count is

correct. Evidence has been led in respect of the identification parades

held. At that time, 1st accused was the 4th suspect. He has been

identified by PW 3 in the identification parade. After identifying, he had

said that the person involved has a similar face to the 1st accused. Also,

a specific action performed by the 1st accused was not said by the

PW 3. Because of these infirmities, the learned High Court Judge

decided not to act on the identification done in the identification parade.

In these circumstances, it has to be decided whether committing the

offence of robbery by the appellant has been proved.

In Podisingho Vs. King - 53 NLR 49, Gunawardane Vs. The Republic of

Sri Lanka - (1981) 2 Sri L.R 315, Don Sunny Vs. Attorney General

(1998) 2 Sri L.R 1 and several other judicial authorities, it has been held

that it is incumbent on the prosecution to establish that the

circumstances the prosecution relied on are consistent only with the

guilt of the accused-appellant and inconsistent with any reasonable

hypothesis of his innocence.

In this case, the fingerprint registrars expert opinion has not been

challenged by the learned defence counsel. Expert evidence establishes

that the 1st accuseds fingerprints and a palm print were on the receiver.

The argument advanced by the learned Presidents Counsel for the

appellant was that the behavior of a person who is agitated during a

commotion is in an unexpected way and thus keeping the receiver on

the table by the appellant as described in his dock statement could be

happened. Therefore, He contended that the accused appellants dock

statement has not been properly considered.

In reply, the learned Senior State Counsel contended that according to

the evidence of PW 18, the receiver was found under the cashiers table.

PW 1 stated in his evidence that one person among the gang who came

for the robbery grabbed the receiver of the phone, pulled it out and at

6

that moment, the receiver broke off from the telephone. During this

commotion, PW 2 had crawled under the cashiers table and she also

testified that the receiver slipped close to her legs. So, the evidence that

the telephone receiver was pulled out and fell under the cashiers table

is well corroborated by each other's evidence.

In addition, the fact that the receiver which was pulled out was under

the table has not been challenged on behalf of the accused-appellant.

The appellant stated in his dock statement that he kept the receiver on

the table. It is obvious, if he did so, he kept it after it had been thrown

out by one of the persons in the gang. But when the PW18, the registrar

of fingerprints went there for examination after the incident, the

receiver was not on the table but it was under the table. The said item

of evidence has also not been challenged on behalf of the appellant. In

such circumstances, it is apparent that in fact, the receiver had not

been kept on the table as stated by the appellant in his dock statement.

Therefore, the learned High Court Judge is correct in rejecting this

unbelievable dock statement.

Undisputedly, the unchallenged evidence of this case clearly establishes

that robbery was taken place in this place. Moreover, it was clearly

elicited from the evidence that the land phone was in the restricted area

for the customers. Hence, pulling out the receiver had to be done by a

member of the gang and expert evidence on finger print proves that it

has been done by the appellant. In considering the entirety of the

evidence, it is well established now, the appellant committed the

robbery with others in the gang. Therefore, the learned High Court

Judge is correct in deciding that the 1st accused-appellant has

committed the offence of robbery, as the only inference that could be

drawn by the aforesaid circumstantial evidence is that the appellant is

guilty of the offence of robbery.

7

Accordingly, the conviction in respect of the 5th count has to be

affirmed. For an offence under Section 380 of the Penal Code, an

accused shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which

may extend to 10 years and shall also be liable to a fine. The learned

High Court Judge imposed a ten-year sentence and a sum of rupees

Ten thousand as a fine for the 5th count. Therefore, the sentence

imposed by the learned High Court Judge is neither illegal nor wrong

in principle. When considering the nature of the crime, I hold that the

sentence is not excessive.

Now, this court has to examine whether the appellant had the

murderous intention to convict him for the 4th count. The learned

Presidents Counsel for the appellant contended that even if it was

proved that the appellant was part of the gang which committed the

robbery, nevertheless it has to be established that he shared a common

murderous intention. He contended further that under Section 32 of

the Penal Code, liability cannot be imputed merely because the

participants were members of a gang that committed the robbery. He

submitted that the prosecution has to establish beyond reasonable

doubt that the appellant shared a common intention in committing the

murder of the deceased. I agree that the said legal position regarding

the common intention stated by the learned Presidents Counsel is

correct.

In reply, the learned Senior State Counsel for the respondent contended

that the common intention can arise in the spur of the moment and

since the deceased was a barrier for the appellant and others to

accomplish their initial common intention of robbery, the most logical

inference is that the murderous common intention arose in that spur

of the moment. In addition, the learned Senior State Counsel submitted

that the gang came with a gun and they had the common intention of

shooting if the necessity arises. The learned Senior State Counsel

8

pointed out further that the manner in which they acted falls under the

second limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code.

Series of Judicial Authorities in respect of the common intention has

been tendered by both the learned Presidents Counsel and the learned

Senior State Counsel to substantiate their arguments. Undoubtedly,

participation by each accused person in the actus reus of the offence

and the sharing of the requisite mens rea among all the accused

persons are required to establish common intention. In addition, the

mental sharing must be evidenced by a criminal act or illegal omission

manifesting the state of mind to be liable under Section 32 of the Penal

Code.

Although the learned counsel for both parties argued at length about

the common intention, it is my view that the doctrine of common

intention need not be applied to determine the instant action. The

appellant himself admitted by his dock statement that he was at the

aforesaid betting center at the time of the crime. The prosecution

established that the said gang entered the restricted area for the

customers to commit this crime. Fingerprint experts unchallenged

evidence establishes that the 1st accused-appellants fingerprints and

palmprint were there on the telephone receiver which was thrown out

in that area. Therefore, it is well established that the appellant was one

of the persons in the gang who committed the robbery.

The next matter to be considered is whether the member of the gang

who shot at the deceased was established? The witness PW 3 stated in

his evidence that the appellant shot at the television. The relevant

questions and answers are as follows:

:

In cross examination also PW 3 has said that he saw the four persons.

: . (page 142 of the brief)

It is vital to be noted that it has never been challenged on behalf of the

appellant that the appellant shot at the television. In cross-

examination, PW 3 was asked only 14 questions. Although it was

revealed in cross-examination that the PW 3 identified the appellant in

the Identification Parade and stated that the person who participated

in the robbery was someone with a face like this, in cross-examining

the PW 3 in the High Court, it was not suggested to the PW 3 that at

least the appellant was not the person who shot at the television.

It is important to be noted that although the identification of the

appellant by the PW 3 in the identification parade is not precise as such,

it is a fact that PW 3 identified the 1st accused-appellant in the

identification parade. When the fingerprint expert proves that the

appellants fingerprints and palm print were in the telephone receiver

and the evidence of the witnesses reveals that one person of the gang

pulled and thrown out the receiver, it is well established that the PW 3

had identified the appellant very correctly as one of the persons came

for the robbery. Now, when taking the evidence of PW 3 and

unchallenged expert evidence together, the appellants identity has

10

been precisely proved. Therefore, PW 3s evidence that the appellant

shot at the television could be accepted without any reasonable doubt.

It is clearly established by the aforesaid circumstances that the

appellant was possessed with a gun at the time of the crime and there

was no evidence whatsoever that the gang had more than one gun. Also,

it is an undisputed fact that the cause of death of the deceased was due

to gunshot injuries. Prosecution witnesses also testified that one of the

gang members shot at the deceased. As only the appellant was armed

with a gun, it is evident that he shot the deceased and there was no

possibility whatsoever for anybody else to shoot the deceased.

Therefore, the doctrine of common intention need not be considered

here. In the circumstances, the only inference that could be drawn is

that the accused-appellant and no one else shot the deceased.

An argument can be advanced that he only shot at the television but

the same shot went on to the deceased also and he had no intention of

killing the deceased. That could happen because no one says how many

gunshots were fired. Also, no one saw the appellant shoot the deceased.

They heard gunshots and then the deceased was laying on the floor

covered in blood. For such a situation, the fourth limb to Section 294

of the Penal Code applies. The fourth limb to Section 294 states as

follows: If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently

dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or such bodily

injury as is likely to cause death and commits such act without any

excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as

aforesaid.

In this place, there were several people. The appellant was armed with

a gun and it is obvious that there was an imminent danger of causing

death to somebody if a shot had been fired. The appellant fired at the

television. So, if the death of the deceased occurred as a result of the

said firing, the appellant is guilty for the offence of murder in terms of

11

the said fourth limb to Section 294 of the Penal Code. Hence, even in

those circumstances, it is established that the appellant has committed

the murder.

As decided in several judicial authorities, in deciding a case on

circumstantial evidence, the inference that can be arrived at should be

consistent with the guilt of the accused only and inconsistent with his

innocence. In the instant action, the only inference that can be arrived

at under the aforesaid circumstances is that the appellant and no one

else shot at the deceased and committed the offence of murder.

The learned High Court Judge took a slightly different view in convicting

the appellant for the 4th count. However, I hold that the learned High

Court Judges conclusion that the first accused-appellant is guilty of

the charge of murder is correct in law for the reasons stated above.

Accordingly, I uphold the conviction and the sentence imposed on the

appellant for the 4th and 5th counts.

Appeal dismissed.
