Decided on: 15.03.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to set aside the sentence pronounced on

31.10.2017 by the learned High Court Judge.

In the instant matter accused respondent (hereinafter referred to as the respondent ) has

been indicted under sections 354 and 365 of the Penal Code and the respondent had

pleaded not guilty and the trial had commenced and upon the conclusion of the trial the

learned High Court Judge had convicted the respondent for and had sentenced him as

follows ,

1) Charge one ,2 years RI and fine and a default term, 2) Charge two and three 15 years RI each with fine, default term and compensation.

Being aggrieved by the above sentence the instant application for revision has been filed

challenging only the sentence imposed as per the prayer to the petition.

This Court notes that the above sentence has been passed in October 2017 and the instant

application for revision has been filed in September 2019 which is exactly after two years.

It is well settled law that when a party files an application for revision the party filling the

same must satisfy this Court that there are matters which shocks the conscious of this Court

in the impugned judgment.

But the party filling the same must come to Court by way of revision without delay and if

they do so they must explain to the satisfaction of Court as to the reasons for the delay

and this position has been discussed in the judgment by this Court in

CA/PHC/APN/21/2021 where it has been held that delay if unexplained is fatal, and in

the instant case the petition is silent in explaining the delay and furthermore the Counsel

when making the submissions in Court adopted a very lopsided attitude in explaining the

delay which this Court notes with much regret.

The Counsel appearing for the respondents also has taken up a preliminary objection to

the unexplained delay by the petitioner and the noncompliance of Supreme Court Rule.

The position of delay has been very lengthily discussed in the judgment of Rajapakse vs.

The State 2001 2 SLR 161, Camillus Ignatiuss OIC of Uhana Police Station CA 907 /89,

Herath Mudiyanselage Ratnasirs ails Inflame vs. AG CA(PHC) APN 44/2016 Seylan Bank vs.

Thangavelu (2004)2 SLR101, and in many others.

Therefore the delay in filling the instant application for revision is unexplained and this

Court considers it to be a well-founded ground to dismiss the instant application.

Apart from the above , this Court also notes that there is no illegality in the sentence

imposed by the learned High Court Judge, in fact he has considered the ingredients which

should be considered as said by His Lordship S.N.Silva CJ in the judgment of AGvs J.S.

Ulluwaduge and another BASL News 4/2/95 where it has said that In deciding what

sentence to be imposed the judge must necessarily consider the offence committed the

gravity of the offence, the manner in which it has been committed, the mechanisms and

the manipulation resorted to do the effect of the offence on the organization in respect of

which it has been committed, the persons who have been effected by it, the ingenuity in

which it has been committed and the trial judge who has the sole discretion in imposing

Page 4 of 4

the sentence should not surrender the sacred right or duty to any other person or

counsel

Hence as stated by the Counsel for the respondents the trial judge has considered the

gravity of the offence, the tender age of the victim and the matured age of the accused in

passing the sentence.

It has been held in the case of SC Appeal No 115/2014 by His Lordship Aluvihare J that in

revision an accused would therefore be entitled to relief if it is shown that the

irregularity complained of had in fact prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

has occasioned a failure of justice. A mere statement to that effect would certainly not be

sufficient but it must be shown as to how the failure has resulted .

But this Court sees no failure of justice nor has b this Court been shown so by the Counsel

for the petitioner.

Hence this Court sees no illegality in the sentence imposed by the learned Judge, and the

Counsel for the petitioner does not say so either, which is required to act in revision.

As such in view of the unexplained delay and the lack of circumstances which shocks the

conscious of this Court, the instant application for revision is hereby dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Neil Iddawala J.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
