Judgment

This appeal emanates from the Order made by the Provincial High Court of Ratnapura

exercising revisionary jurisdiction in case bearing No: RA 19/2017 against the Order

of the learned Magistrate of Kalawana in case bearing No: 14032 made on 22.04.2015

in terms of Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979.

It appears that the Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station, Kalawana had filed an

information in terms of Section 66(1) (a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act on

the premise that there is a breach of the peace threatened or likely to be threatened

as a result of a dispute over possession of the land in question between the 1st Party

Petitioner and 2nd and 3rd Party Respondents.

The learned Magistrate who was acting as a Primary Court Judge allowed parties to

file affidavits, counter affidavits and also written submissions. Consequently, the

learned Magistrate delivered the Order on 22.04.2015, in favour of the 2nd and 3rd

Party Respondents, granting possession of the disputed land. Being aggrieved by the

said Order, the 1st Party Petitioner had made an application, bearing No: RA 19/2017

in the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa Province Holden at Ratnapura

exercising the revisionary jurisdiction.

The learned High Court Judge having inquired into the matter on the evidence placed

before him, delivered the Order on 29.08.2017 in favour of the Respondents

confirming the decision of the learned Magistrate of Kalawana. Being aggrieved by

Page 4 of 8

the said Order, the 1st Party Petitioner-Appellant had preferred an appeal to this

Court.

Since the dispute between parties is related to possession of the land in dispute, it

is clear that Section 68 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act applies. However, the

Appellant argues that the Order of the learned Magistrate is illegal as the provisions

under Section 68(3) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act applies in these

circumstances.

According to Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, when

there is a dispute over possession of a land or a part of land before the Magistrates

Court, under Section 68(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, the

duty of the Magistrate is to hold an inquiry to determine as to who was in possession

of the land or part of the land in question on the date on which information was

filed under Section 66 and make an Order as to who is entitled to possession of such

land or part thereof.

Furthermore, as per Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979,

when there is a dispute before a Magistrates Court over possession of a land or part

of a land, under Section 68(3) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979,

if the Magistrate is satisfied that any person who had been in possession of the land

or part has been forcibly dispossessed within a period of 2 months immediately

before the date on which the information was filed under Section 66, he or she may

make a determination to that effect and make an Order directing that the party

dispossessed be restored to possession and prohibiting all disturbances of such

possession otherwise than under the authority of an order or decree of a competent

court.

It is seen that there were no facts regarding a forcible dispossession among the

parties of this case. Hence, the duty of the said learned Magistrate of Kalawana was

to make an Order under the Section 68(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No.

44 of 1979.

It appears that the Counsel for the Appellant raised a new contention regarding the

identification of the land in question before us at the argument stage alleging that

Page 5 of 8

the land in dispute had not been properly identified and that the learned Magistrate

cannot make an Order in respect of an unidentified land.

It is worthy to note that the learned Magistrate of Kalawana in his Order dated

22.04.2015 had made a specific finding with regard to the identification of the land

in dispute.

It states inter alia,

A

2, 3 .

B C .

.

B .

Appellant had not challenged the said finding of the learned Magistrate in the High

Court of Ratnapura neither had it been raised as an issue in the petition of appeal

filed, addressed to this Court.

On this premise, it was argued on behalf of the Respondents that the Appellants

new contention with regard to the identification of the land in dispute cannot be

considered at the appeal stage. It is settled law that only new questions of law

comprising matters purely on law can be considered at any stage in an appeal or

revision application and not of fact. Only questions of law can be considered in an

appeal.

It is needless to say the identification of the land in dispute is a matter that consists

purely based on facts and not on questions of law. Thus, it cannot be considered at

this stage.

Accordingly, the parties of this case had to prove their position in respect of the

possession of the said disputed land.

It is observable that the documents submitted by the Appellant and the Respondents

were carefully considered by the learned Magistrate of Kalawana, and later the

learned High Court Judge of Ratnapura, when deciding on who could prove they had

possession of the land in dispute.

It was submitted on behalf of the Respondents that the learned Magistrate of

Kalawana, having examined the documents tendered by the Appellant made the

following observations in the Order dated 22.04.2015:

i. The Grama Niladhari Report marked 114 does not clearly states

whether the Appellant has possession of the land in dispute,

ii. The documents relating to the Appellant obtaining an electricity

connection marked 111 shows that the said connection has been

obtained for a house, but the disputed land does not contain a house.

iii. The license to grow tea marked 114 states that the land is 1 Acre in

extent, but the Appellant's first Affidavit contradicts this as it states the

disputed land is 1 Acres in extent.

iv. The tax documents marked 112 and 113 also contradict each other

as they state that the land is 1 Acre and 1 Acre 2 Roods in extent

respectively.

Due to the above reasons, the learned Magistrate concluded that the documents

tendered by the Appellant are not relevant to the land in dispute and that as a result

of it, it should be disregarded.

The learned High Court Judge of Ratnapura, having carefully examined the evidence

put forward by the parties before the Magistrate had made the same observations

as that of the learned Magistrate, regarding the documents tendered by the

Appellant. The conclusion reached is also the same; the documents tendered by the

Appellant are not relevant to the land in dispute and do not prove the Appellant's

possession with regard to the said land.

However, in contrast to the above, the learned Magistrate and the learned High

Court Judge concluded that the documents tendered by the Respondents show that

the Respondents were in possession. Furthermore, it is observed that documents

Page 7 of 8

such as the Grama Niladhari documents marked 2, 36 and 2, 311 obtained

from the same Grama Niladhari Officer clearly stated that the Respondents were in

possession of the land in dispute which is identified by name in the said documents.

According to the observation notes of the Police Officer and the affidavits of both

parties filed in Magistrates Court of Kalawana, it is clear that the disputed land is

the land which is marked as B in the observation notes of the Police. It is pertinent

to note that the learned Magistrate had stated in the Judgment that both parties do

not dispute the identity of the disputed land marked B in the observation notes of

the Police.

It appears that the Appellant has attempted to show the land called Medakumbhure

Godella and the land called Karuhene Kumbhure Godella are the same land and

he has tried to prove that he has possession of the land called Karuhene Kumbhure

Godella.

However, it is relevant to note that the Appellant had not been able to substantiate

the said position by the documents marked as 114, 115, 116 and 117 submitted

on behalf of the Appellant, to prove the said contention that the documents are not

relevant to Lot B depicted in the sketch, the land identified by the police, as the

disputed land. Therefore, the Appellant has not proved that he has been in

possession of the disputed portion of land two months prior to the date on which the

information was filed.

It is worthy to note that the documents 2, 33, 2, 34, 2, 35, 2, 36 and 2, 37

tendered as proved by the Respondents clearly tally with the investigation

conducted by the Police and the claims made by the Respondents as to the

identification of the disputed land.

It is apparent that as per the evidence placed before the learned Magistrate, the

Appellant had not proved his possession to the disputed land. However, the

Respondent has proved his continuous possession to the disputed land.

Furthermore, it is seen that the learned High Court Judge has also analyzed the

documents submitted by the Appellant as well as that of the Respondents with their

Page 8 of 8

affidavits and had come to the correct finding of fact and law and confirmed the

Order of the learned Magistrate and thereupon decided to dismiss the revision

application filed by the Appellant.

Therefore, the Appellant is not entitled to seek relief under the provisions of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act with regard to the possession of the disputed land.

However, the 2nd and 3rd Party Respondent-Respondents have been in possession of

the disputed portion of land continuously and the Appellant had disturbed their

peaceful possession of the land in dispute.

Hence, we see no reason for us to interfere with the Order of the learned Magistrate

dated 22.04.2015 and the Order of the learned High Court Judge dated 29.08.2017.

Thus, we dismiss the appeal of the 1st Party Petitioner-Appellant with cost.
