Decided on: 28.02.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner was elected a member of the Hanguranketha Pradeshiya Sabha

("Pradeshiya Sabha") in the Nuwara Eliya District at the Local Government Elections

held in 2018 and was elected as the Chairman of the said Pradeshiya Sabha by its

members. The Petitioner was required to submit a budget for the succeeding year i.e., year

2022 (budget) in terms of the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act No. 15 of 1987, as amended (the

Act). The issues emanating in this application revolves around the said budget.

Facts in this case are very much similar to the case of Kadawatha Sathara and Gangawata

Korale Pradeshiya Sabha bearing no. CA/Writ/27/2022 in which the Governor of the

Central Province had declared that the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha is considered

to resign from the post of Chairman due to failure to pass the budget prepared by the said

Chairman.

Page 7 of 11

In the instant application also the learned Counsel for several Respondents took the same

line of argument as advanced in the other connected cases. The Respondents contended

that the questions relating to this case have already been resolved by His Lordship Justice

Arjuna Obeyesekere with the agreement of His Lordship Justice Mayadunne Corea in four

separate cases of this Court. i.e., CA/Writ/24/2021, CA/Writ/51/2021,

CA/Writ/57/2021 & CA/Writ/61/2021. Accordingly, the relevant Respondents moved

that this application be dismissed in limine.

Thus, it is necessary to ascertain in this case also whether the Petitioner has submitted a

case which is suitable for full investigation and a hearing after issuing notice on all the

Respondents. In the backdrop of the above orders made by this Court and upon the

circumstances, the Court should be satisfied that there is a prima facie case that ought to

be resolved after full argument.

The Petitioner on 19.11.2021 circulated a draft budget among the members of the

Pradeshiya Sabha (Members) requesting them to submit any proposals on or before

06.12.2021. Accordingly, couple of Members forwarded their proposals. A special meeting

was held on 16.12.2021 at which the budget was tabled by the Petitioner along with the

new amendments proposed.

Since three proposals out of the four were regarding a similar matter, the Petitioner

accepted the same and the remaining proposal was withdrawn. Subsequently the

Petitioner declared the budget as duly adopted by the Members. Thereafter, certain

Members called for a division. Hence, a vote was allowed and the Petitioner however,

intimated to Members that a division would not affect the budget as the Petitioner had

already accepted all proposed amendments. Finally, the budget was defeated by a

majority. (33 voted against and 1 member voted in favour of the budget)

The Petitioner on 17.12.2021 by virtue of his letter marked P7, informed the 2nd

Respondent that the budget had been duly adopted as per section 168(2) of the Act by

having agreed to all proposals submitted by the Members. In response to P7, the 2nd

Respondent by letter dated 27.12.2021, marked P10, informed the Petitioner to comply

and take steps in compliance with the orders in cases bearing Nos. CA/Writ/24/2021 and

CA/Writ/51/2021 of this Court and also to re-submit the budget for a vote as the budget

had been defeated by a majority.

Page 8 of 11

However, the Petitioner without re-submitting the budget informed the 2nd Respondent

that the budget prepared by him has been duly adopted on the alleged basis that all the

amendments made to the budget were accepted.

The 2nd Respondent based on such circumstances has issued the Gazette Notification No.

2261/3 dated 03.01.2022 marked P13 declaring that the Petitioner is considered to have

resigned from the post of Chairman with effect from 31.12.2021 and the post of Chairman

is considered to be vacant since that date due to failure to pass the budget prepared by the

Petitioner under section 168 & 169 of the Act and also on non-compliance with the said

section 169.

The budget which was tabled on 16.12.2021 by the Petitioner was for the year 2022 and

that was for a period after two years since the commencement of the term of office of the

Hanguranketha Pradeshiya Sabha.

The initial questions which arise in this application is also similar to the case bearing No.

CA/Writ/27/2022 and such questions are as follows;

i. whether the Petitioner is entitled to declare the budget which was defeated by a

majority as duly adopted under section 169 of the Act based on the alleged

reason that he had accepted the amendments proposed by Members,

ii. whether the Petitioner is deemed to have resigned from the office of Chairman

as he failed to re-submit the budget for a vote after it was defeated.

I have already dealt with and determined similar questions relating to this application in;

a) Madampage Nanda Wijeratne Silva vs. Marshal of the Airforce Roshan

Goonetileke Governor-Western Province & others (CA/Writ/649/2021,

decided on 28.02.2022)

b) Kasudeen Mohomed Nihar vs. Anuradha Yahampath Governor- Eastern

Province & others (CA/Writ/12/2022, decided on 28.02.2022)

c) J. Thilekeratne vs. Hon. M. Herath,Governor-North Central Province & others

(CA/Writ/31/2022, decided on 28.02.2022)

I have extensively considered the submissions made on behalf of the Petitioner as well as

the submissions on behalf of the Respondents which are identical to the view point taken

by the Respondents in all above three cases. I hold that the reasoning given by me to arrive

Page 9 of 11

at the conclusion in above three cases are applicable in relation to the questions in the

instance application also.

I need to reiterate in this application also that my findings in the above three cases were

mainly based on the precedent established by His Lordship Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere

with agreement of His Lordship Justice Mayadunne Corea in the below mentioned cases;

a) Wellawattage Sarath Peiris vs. Katunayake Seeduwa Urban Council, Seeduwa

& others (CA/Writ/24/2021, decided on 10.06.2021),

b) Manodara Aacharige Chaminda Sugath, Chairman vs. Anuradha Yahampath,

Governor, Eastern Province & others (CA/Writ/51/2021, decided on

10.06.2021).

c) H.M. Lalantha Sumith Seneviratne vs. Pradeshiya Sabhawa of Padiyathalawa

& others (CA/Writ/57/2021, decided on 10.06.2021)

d) A.P. Ranasinghe Bandara, Chairman vs. Anuradha Yahampath, Governor of

Eastern Province & others (CA/Writ/61/2021, decided on 10.06.2021).

In my order in CA/Writ/31/2021, I have summarized the precedent in the above four

cases as follows;

i. In terms of section 168 (2) of the Act, the budget shall be passed by the Council.

ii. However, in terms of section 169, the budget submitted by the Chairman during

the first two years of the Council shall be considered as the duly adopted budget,

by operation of law, even though the said budget has not been passed by a majority

vote. Moreover, taking a vote even during the first two years is essential.

iii. After the first two years of the Council, the budget at the first submission or at the

re-submission should be passed by majority votes of the Council.

iv. It is a mandatory duty of the Chairman to submit the annual budget and if the

budget is defeated at the first submission, the chairman must re-submit the budget,

for a vote by the Members of the Council.

v. In the event the budget is defeated any time after the first two years and as a result,

if the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha;

a) fails to re-submit the budget and/or

b) fails to get it passed upon re-submission to the Council,

Page 10 of 11

the relevant Chairman is deemed to have vacated his post in terms of the proviso

to section 169.

vi. Even if the Chairman accepts the amendments, modifications, additions to the

budget or to the supplementary budget, the Chairman is subjected to above cardinal

requirements.

Additionally, it is important to reiterate the following passage in my order dated

28.02.2022 in CA/Writ/31/2022;

Moreover, the rationale of the decision of the Court in all the above cases in addition to the

provision of the said sections 168 & 169 is based on section 14 (1) of the Act. I also have

observed in my order in CA/Writ/649/2021, the deeming provisions of section 169 of the

Act should be carefully interpreted in line with the basic principles of Democracy and Good

Governance without undermining the consent or the division of the Members of the

Pradeshiya Sabha.

Now, I advert to the reliefs sought by the Petitioner in this application. The Petitioner has

prayed for in the prayer of the Petition inter alia for a mandate in the nature of a writ of

Certiorari quashing the Gazette Notification bearing No. 2261/3 dated 03.01.2022

marked P13 issued by the 1st Respondent and the letter dated 06.01.2022 marked P15

issued by the 2nd Respondent. The 1st Respondent by the said Gazette Notification P13

has declared that the Petitioner is deemed to have resigned from the post of Chairman as

the budget submitted by the said Chairman has not been passed in terms of section 168 of

the Act and that the Petitioner has failed to act in terms of the proviso to section 169 of

the Act.

On a careful consideration of the whole matter and in light of the reasoning given in my

above orders (CA/Writ/649/2021, CA/Writ/12/2022, CA/Writ/31/2022) and in view

of the legal analysis established in the cases bearing Nos. CA/Writ/24/2021,

CA/Writ/51/2021, CA/Writ/57/2021 and CA/Writ/61/2021, I take the view that the

1st Respondent Governor has given due effect to the provisions of sections 14, 168 and 169

of the Act and lawfully decided that the Petitioner has deemed to have resigned from the

office of Chairman.

Page 11 of 11

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the questions raised by the Petitioner in the

instant application have already been resolved in the aforesaid orders of this Court.

Therefore, based on the arguability principles that should be adopted in respect of matters

relating to issuance of notice in a juridical review application, I arrive at the conclusion

that there is no arguable case or a prima facie case for this Court to issue formal notice on

the Respondents in this application. Therefore, I proceed to refuse this application.
