Mohammed Laffar, J.

The Respondent-Appellant-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to

as the Petitioner) above named had initially sought Leave

to Appeal from the Order of the Board of Quazis dated

23.02.2019. This Court granted leave on 14.02.2020 on the

questions of law set out in paragraphs 6(a), (d), (e) and (f) of

the petition dated 21.03.2019.

The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred

to as the Respondent) instituted proceedings before the

Quazi for Matale, seeking child maintenance of Rs. 65,000/-

monthly from the Petitioner. Having received the notice

from the said Quazi, the Petitioner, by letter dated

08.07.2016, requested the said Quazi to take necessary

steps to appoint a Special Quazi to hear and determine the

matter for the reason that he has death threats (vide

document marked P1, page 14).

Thereafter, the learned Quazi proceeded with the ex parte

inquiry and made the Order nisi dated 17.09.2016 directing

the Petitioner to pay a sum of Rs.65, 000/- as child

maintenance monthly. Subsequently, in terms of Rule 4 of

the Fourth Schedule of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act,

No. 13 of 1951 (as amended), the Petitioner was served with

a notice dated 17.09.2016, asking to show cause within a

Page 3 of 13

month as to why the said Order nisi should not be made

absolute.

The said Rule 4 reads as follows:

Where the Respondent does not appear on the day

fixed for the inquiry, the Quazi, if he has dispensed

with service of notice on the Respondent or if the

service of notice on the Respondent or the posting up

of the notice is proved by statement on oath or

affirmation, shall proceed with the inquiry ex-parte and

shall, if he is satisfied that the claimant or complainant

or applicant is entitled to the relief prayed for, make in

his favour an order nisi conditioned to take effect in the

event of the Respondent not showing cause against it

on a day specified for that purpose in the order and

shall direct a copy of such order certified under his

hand to be served on the Respondent

Further, the Rule No. 5 spells out that,

where the respondent fails to appear in any case in

which the Quazi has deepened with service of the copy

of the order nisi on the respondent.or where the

respondent appears but fails to show cause against the

order, the Quazi shall make the order absolute.

It is pertinent to note that the Petitioner in this case, having

received the show cause notice, did not appear before the

Quazi under Rule No. 6, and preferred an appeal to the

Board of Quazis against the said Order nisi. The said Rule

No. 6 is reproduced as follows:

Page 4 of 13

Where the respondent appears and shows cause to

the satisfaction of the Quazi why the order nisi should

not be made absolute, the Quazi shall set aside the

order nisi and shall proceed with the inquiry as though

no default had been made by the Respondent in

appearing in compliance with the notice issued under

Rule 2.

When the appeal was taken up before the Board of Quazis,

the learned Counsel for the Respondent raised a preliminary

legal objection as to the maintainability of the appeal on the

basis that there is no right to appeal against the Order nisi.

The Board of Quazis, in the impugned Order dated

23.02.2019, dismissed the appeal on the footing that the

Petitioner has no right to appeal against the Order nisi.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the instant leave to

appeal application has been filed by the Petitioner.

Having scrutinized the Rules in the Fourth Schedule of the

Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, No. 13 of 1951 (as

amended), it is abundantly clear that the Order nisi made by

the Quazi after an ex-parte inquiry is an interim Order. If the

Petitioner is not satisfied with the said Order nisi, the Fourth

Schedule provides an opportunity to the Petitioner to invoke

the jurisdiction of the same Quazi to get the Order nisi set

aside. Instead, the Petitioner in this case opted to prefer an

appeal to the Board of Quazis against the Order nisi which is

erroneous and misconceived in law.

It is to be noted that, under the Muslim Marriage and

Divorce Act, No. 13 of 1951 (as amended) a right to appeal

Page 5 of 13

is available against a final Order made by a Quazi under the

rules in the Third Schedule or under section 47 of the said

Act. In this regard, section 60 (1) of the said Act reads as

follows:

Any party aggrieved by any final Order made by a

Quazi under the rules in the Third Schedule or in any

inquiry under section 47 shall have a right of appeal to

the Board of Quazis

Besides, proviso of section 60 (1) of the Muslim Marriage

and Divorce Act, No. 13 of 1951 (as amended) reads thus,

Provided that there shall be no appeal from an Order

absolute made in accordance with the rules in the

Fourth Schedule in any inquiry under section 47.

The Rule No. 10 of the Fourth Schedule of the said Act reads

as follows:

No appeal shall lie against any order absolute made

by the Quazi in pursuance of the rules in this Schedule,

but if any person against whom an order absolute has

been made appears within a reasonable time after

such order and satisfies the Quazi that he was

prevented from appearing to show cause against the

making of the order absolute by reasons of illness,

accident, misfortune or other unavoidable cause or by

not having received notice of the proceedings, the

Quazi may upon such terms and conditions as he may

think it just and right to impose set aside the order

Page 6 of 13

absolute and proceed with the inquiry as though there

had been no default in appearances.

In the light of the proviso to section 60 (1) and the Rule 10

of the Fourth Schedule of the Act, it is crystal clear that

there is no right to appeal from the Order nisi and Order

absolute made in accordance with the Rules in the Fourth

Schedule.

In the circumstances, I am of the considered view that the

impugned Order of the Board of Quazis dismissing the

appeal of the Petitioner on the basis that there is no right to

appeal from the Order nisi made by the Quazi is absolutely

within the purview of the provisions of the Muslim Marriage

and Divorce Act, No. 13 of 1951 (as amended), and

therefore, I see no reason to interfere with the same.

Be that as it may, the Petitioner, having received a notice

from the Quazi, pertaining to the child maintenance

application filed by the Respondent, instead of appearing

before the Quazi, dispatched a letter dated 08.07.2016 to

the Quazi, requesting him to handover the case to a Special

Quazi under section 67 of the said Act. However, in terms of

the provisions of section 67 of the said Act, the Petitioner

has no right to request the Quazi to hand over the

proceedings to another Quazi. A Quazi is bound to transfer

proceedings to another Quazi only on the directions of the

Judicial Service Commission. In this regard, the observation

rightly made by the Board of Quazis in the impugned Order

is appreciated by this Court, which is reproduced as follows:

Page 7 of 13

It is worth mentioning here that the Respondent-

Appellant being a medical doctor by profession having

been well aware that the other cases were transferred

by the Judicial Service Commission and not by the

Quazi, (the Quazi has no power to transfer a case on

his own) he has chosen to dictate his own terms to the

learned Quazi to transfer this child maintenance case

without duly applying or complaining to the Judicial

Service Commission to transfer the said case. It is the

Judicial Service Commission which is the sole authority

in respect of appointment of special Quazi and transfer

of cases under Section 67 of the Muslim Marriage and

Divorce Act

[Vide page 3 of the Board Quazis dated 23.02.2019

(marked as P5)]

Section 67 of the said Act reads thus,

Where it appears to the Judicial service Commission,

on the application of any party to, or any person

interested in, any proceedings instituted or to be

instituted under this Act before a Quazi, that a fair

and impartial inquiry cannot be had before such

Quazi, or where a Quazi himself makes an

application in that behalf to the said

Commission, the Commission may order that such

proceedings be instituted before and heard by a

special Quazi appointed in that behalf by the

Commission under section 14 and, in the event of any

such order being made, any proceedings taken before

Page 8 of 13

the first-mentioned Quazi in respect of the matter to

which such application relates shall be of no effect.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner by appending

document marked X, X1 (vide motion dated 20.09.2019), Y

and Y1 (vide motion dated 21.10.2019) submitted that, upon

the Petitioners request, the Judicial Service Commission by

its letter dated 04.11.2016 transferred the present

proceeding to the Quazi Court of Mawanella from the Quazi

Court of Matale. Thus, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner

contended that the learned Quazi for Matale has no

jurisdiction to hear and determine the case and the said

proceedings to be set aside forthwith, soon after the

appointment of the Quazi for Mawanella by the Judicial

Service Commission to hear the matter. Accordingly, the

learned Counsel for the Petitioner took up the position that

as the matter was transferred from the Quazi Court of

Matale to the Quazi Court of Mawanella, the Order of the

Quazi Court of Matale is of no effect. The learned Counsel

for the Petitioner, in the course of the argument further

contended that, when the transfer is effected by Judicial

Service Commission, any proceedings including Orders

whatsoever made is to be set aside.

However, it is to be noted that the impugned Order of the

Quazi Court for Matale which was challenged by the

Petitioner in the Board of Quazis was made on 17.09.2016,

prior to the letter of transfer (appointment of new Quazi) of

the Judicial Service Commission (vide document marked X).

The Petitioner challenged the said Order of the Quazi Court

Page 9 of 13

of Matale in the Board of Quazis on 14.10.2016 which is also

prior to the said letter of transfer of the Judicial Service

Commission dated 04.11.2016. Therefore, it is apparent that

the direction issued by the Judicial Service Commission to

transfer the case from the Quazi Court of Matale to the

Quazi Court of Mawanella was issued while the appeal was

pending before the Board of Quazis. In other words, when

the Judicial Service Commission issued the said direction of

transfer the case to the Quazi Court of Mawanella, there was

no case proceedings before the Quazi Court of Matale and

the matter was well adjudicated by the learned Quazi

according to law. There were no impediments for the

learned Quazi of Matale to hear and determine the case. In

my view, the said direction of the Judicial Service

Commission dated 04.11.2016 cannot be effectuated

retrospectively to invalidate the impugned Order of the

learned Quazi. Unwittingly, the Judicial Service Commission

proceeded to take the matter out of the former Quazi

without knowing the fact that the said learned Quazi

adjudicated the case according to law. As such, if this Court

concede the position taken by the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner that when the transfer is effected by the

Judicial Service Commission, any proceedings including

orders whatsoever made is to be set aside, I am afraid, this

sort of defence may amount to an abuse of the legal

process. In future, any party or person interested in a Quazi

proceeding, without participating in any inquiry or

dishonouring Quazi Courts notices, soon before delivering

an order, may simply make an application to the Judicial

Page 10 of 13

Service Commission saying that, I am not happy with the

(former) Quazi and transfer my case to another Quazi. This

is not the true proposition of the law. Indeed, when an

aggrieved party thinks that a fair and impartial inquiry

cannot be had before such Quazi, he may directly write

to the Judicial Service Commission to transfer his/her case to

another Quazi to effectuate a fair and impartial inquiry.

However, when a person raises a defence of bias at the

inquiry, the situation is different. In such a case, an affected

party would normally be expected to request that the

person suspected of such bias recuse himself from

participation in the proceedings in question. Parties may be

held to have waived the right to invoke the bias rule if they

were fully informed of the facts that could support a claim of

bias but failed to raise the issue in a timely manner vide S.

Victor Wijerathne v. Tissa R. Balalle and Others,

CA/Writ/262/14 (Court of Appeal Minutes of

05.08.2021) and Manna Dewage Shifani v. M.I.M.

Nasar, CA/LA/06/19 (CA Minutes of 14.02.2022).

In Manna Dewage Shifani v. M.I.M. Nasar (supra), the

Petitioner made a written complaint to the Judicial Service

Commission against the Quazi for Colombo-East alleging

that the said Quazi acted in bias. Despite the said allegation

of bias, the Quazi for Colombo-East decided the matter

against the Petitioner in a short period of one month from

the date of the complaint. Therefore, this Court precisely

observed that the conduct of the Quazi for Colombo-East,

not delaying the proceedings for the directions of the

Page 11 of 13

Judicial Service Commission pertaining to the complaint

made by the Petitioner, not seeking further instructions from

the Judicial Service Commission and concluding the

proceedings in a short period of time buttress the

allegations leveled against him by the Petitioner. It was in

those circumstances, this Court, inter alia, held that when a

party to an action expressly and logically informed Court

that the adjudicator is bias, such adjudicator becomes

disqualified to adjudicate the matter on the doctrine of fair

trial.

However, in the instant case, the Petitioner has never raised

an objection on bias and therefore, the learned Quazi was

not bound to recuse himself from hearing and determining

the proceeding in question.

Moreover, even if the Judicial Service Commission wittingly,

has taken the matter out of the former Quazi and appointed

another Quazi, knowing the facts that the said Quazi has

delivered an appropriate order upon concluding the inquiry

and the Petitioner has filed an appeal to the Board of Quazis,

by its direction, the impugned order cannot be set aside.

The legality of the impugned order can only be challenged in

a proper appellate forum (court of law). Judicial Service

Commission is not an appellate forum but an apex body

which administer and supervise the judicial officers in this

country.

Therefore, I cannot agree with the contention of the

Petitioner.

Page 12 of 13

For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the appeal with costs

fixed at Rs. 50,000/- and affirm the Order nisi dated

17.09.2016 made by the Quazi of Matale and the order of

the Board of Quazis dated 23.02.2019.

Appeal dismissed with costs.
