JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) with another person (5th Accused) were indicted in the High

Court of Nuwara Eliya under the following charges:

1. On or about 19th of February 1996 at Dayagama and Colombo within

the jurisdiction of this court you conspired to cause the death of

Krishnasami Somasundaram and in furtherance of the said

conspiracy caused the death of Krishnasami Somasundaram and

thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 296 of the

Penal Code, read with Sections 113B and 102 of the Penal Code.

2. At the same time, at Dayagama in the cause of the same transaction

you the 1st, 2nd and 3rd accused above named committed the murder

of Krishnasami Somasundaram and thereby committed the offence of

murder punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

3. At the same time at Dayagama in the course of the same transaction

referred to in charge one you the 3rd, 4th and 5th accused above named

committed the robbery of the vehicle bearing registration No. 56-6478

in the possession of Krishnasami Somasundaram and thereby

committed the offence of robbery punishable under Section 380 of the

Penal Code.

The trial commenced before the High Court of Kandy (HC/85/2006) as the

Appellants had opted for a non-jury trial. After the conclusion of evidence

given by two prosecutions witnesses, the case was transferred to the newly

established High Court of Nuwara Eliya and the rest of the trial proceeded

and was concluded there.

4 | P a g e

After the conclusion of the prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge

had called for the defence and the Appellants and 5th accused had made dock

statements and closed their cases. After considering the evidence presented

by both parties, the learned High Court Judge had convicted the 1st, 2nd, 3rd

and 4th Appellants on 17/12/2015 as follows:

1. 1st Count - all the Appellants were convicted and sentenced to death.

2. 2nd Count - 1st and 2nd Appellants were convicted and sentenced to

death.

3. 3rd Count - 3rd and 4th Appellants were convicted and were each

imposed a sentence of 7 years rigours imprisonment with a fine of

Rs.5000/- with a default sentence of 6 months simple imprisonment.

The 5th accused on the indictment was acquitted from all the charges.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid convictions and sentences the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

All the Learned Counsels for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants had given their consent to argue this matter in their absence due

to the Covid 19 pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellants were

connected via Zoom platform from prison.

Background of the Case

According to PW1, the 1st and 2nd Appellants are brothers-in-law who worked

in an estate in Dayagama. 1st Appellant was the Kankani (Chief Supervisor

of Workers) of the estate where the witness was also occupied. The 4th

Appellant was not from the estate but he knew him as a sub-agent who

assisted people from the estate sector to go abroad and also sold clothes to

the people in the estate. On 19/02/1996 when he returned home for lunch

after work, PW1 had seen people gathered near the 1st Appellants house.

5 | P a g e

Thinking that the 4th Appellant would have brought clothes for sale, he too

had gone there and seen all the Appellants and a person introduced as the

driver of the van. He had observed a blue-coloured van parked in the vicinity.

When he inquired the 4th Appellant as to why a van had been brought, he

had told him that a person from the Eastern Division was to be taken for

foreign employment. Before he returned home, he had consumed a glass of

beer offered to him by the Appellants.

After finishing off the work for the day, once he was at home, he had seen

the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Appellants along with the driver walking pass his house.

He too joined the party on his own free will thinking that they were going to

accompany the person who was supposed to go abroad from the Eastern

Division. According to him the distance is about two miles to the Eastern

Division from his house. The foot path leading to the Eastern Division was

in an unpopulated area. While walking along a lonely stretch of the road, the

second Appellant had suddenly dealt a blow on the back of the driver

(deceased) with a club that he had been carrying. As a result of this sudden

attack, the deceased had fallen to the ground. Immediately thereafter, the 1st

Appellant had applied chilli powder on the deceaseds eyes and cut his neck

with a pruning knife. This witness was frightened by witnessing this

unexpected event. He was severely warned by the 1st and 2nd Appellants of

the dire consequences he would have to face if he divulged this incident to

anybody else. This incident had happened around 6.30 p.m. when there was

sufficient moon light.

In the early hours on 20/02/1996, the 1st and 2nd Appellants had visited

PW1s house and asked him to join them to check the potato cultivation. A

mamoty and a Urea Fertilizer Bag were collected from the 1st Appellants

house and the 2nd Appellant had a torch in his possession. On arriving at

the place of incident the witness had observed that both limbs of the

deceaseds body had been severed. Thereafter the 1st and 2nd Appellants had

put the body parts into the Urea Bag and carried up to a place where there

was a cave. Thereafter a ditch had been dug by the 1st and 2nd Appellants

6 | P a g e

and the body had been buried there. After this sequence of incidents, the 1st

and 2nd Appellants had constantly followed the witness restricting his

movements. After four days of the incident, the 1st and 2nd Appellants along

with the witness were taken for questioning by the police. He identified the

trouser of the deceased, the mamoty used for the burial of the body, the club

used for assault, the pruning knife used to cut the neck of the deceased and

the fertilizer bag which was used to bury the body of the deceased.

PW4, the wife of the deceased stated that her husband was a driver by

profession and was employed by PW3, Jude Lal to drive his van for hire. The

deceased had left his home on 19/02/1996 at 7.00 a.m. to go on a hire to

Nuwara Eliya. As he failed to return home a complaint was lodged and

thereafter, she came to know that her husband had been murdered in the

Agarapatana area. She had noticed chilli powder on the deceaseds eyes and

the body had been cut into several parts. She identified the dead body and

the trouser last worn by the deceased.

PW2, had joined the 3rd and 4th Appellants who are his childhood friends on

19/02/1996 to go to Hatton in a hired van. The reason as to why he was

taken to Hatton by the 3rd and 4th Appellants was to bring back a van from

Hatton to Colombo. The 5th accused also joined them and the van driven by

the deceased arrived in Hatton around 1.00 p.m. Thereafter they had gone

to the place of the 1st and 2nd Appellants who were introduced to him for the

first time and thereafter they had proceeded to consume liquor. This was his

first visit to the estate where the 1st and 2nd Appellants resided. Thereafter,

he had gone to play and when he come back, he was unable to find the 1st,

2nd, 3rd Appellants and the van driver. Later in the day, the 3rd Appellant had

given the van key and told him that they are leaving the estate that night.

When he asked about the driver, the 3rd and 4th Appellant had told him that

the driver had gone back to Colombo in the other van. Thereafter, he had

driven the van to Colombo with the 3rd and 4th Appellants and with the 5th

accused. The 4th Appellant had told him that the blue colored van which he

had driven to Colombo belonged to his boss. The suspicious conduct of the

7 | P a g e

3rd and 4th Appellants had prompted him to lodge a complaint at the

Maradana Police Station voluntarily. He had identified the mutilated corpse

of the deceased placed inside a fertilizer bag at the estate.

The Agarapatana Police had conducted the investigation on this crime and

had recovered a mamoty relying upon the statement of the 2nd Appellant and

a club and a knife had been recovered based upon the statement of the 1st

Appellant. Upon information gathered by the Maradana Police the dead body

had been recovered by the police.

The van bearing No. 56-6478 was traced by PW9 when it was parked in the

vicinity of Zahira College, Maradana. Upon the receipt of further information,

PW9 had arrested the 3rd and 4th Appellants and the 5th accused.

When the defense was called all the Appellants had made dock statements

and denied the charges.

The following grounds of appeal were advanced by the 1st and 2nd

Appellants.

1. The learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the evidence

of PW1 to see whether he is a credible witness. Further he had not

applied the test of probability and not considered the

inconsistencies of the evidence of PW1.

2. The learned High Court Judge has failed to give the benefit of the

doubt of the prosecution case to 1st and 2nd Appellants.

The following grounds of appeal were advanced by the 3rd Appellant.

1. Has the prosecution placed cogent and satisfactory evidence for the

court to establish that there was a conspiracy to commit murder?

2. Did the learned High Court judge direct himself correctly in accepting

the evidence of PW1 which is contradictory.

8 | P a g e

The following grounds of appeal were advanced by the 4th Appellant.

1. Has the prosecution proved that PW2s evidence is acceptable?

2. Has the prosecution proved the charges 1 and 3 beyond reasonable

doubt?

3. Has the High Court Judge considered the applicable law relevant

to conspiracy charge proved?

4. Has the High Court Judge considered the evidence favorable to the

4th Appellant?

As the 1st ground of appeal raised by the 1st and 2nd Appellants is similar to

the 2nd ground of appeal raised by the 3rd Appellant, those grounds will be

considered together. In those grounds the Counsel argued that the evidence

given by PW1 has not passed the test of probability. It was further argued

that the evidence given by PW1 contains numerous contradictions.

PW1 in his evidence clearly stated how he joined the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Appellants along with the deceased when they passed his house. He had

voluntarily asked them whether he could join them as they said that they

were going to the Eastern Division to bring a prospective foreign employment

seeker.

The contradictions marked as V1-V4 at the trial relates to the manner in

which he joined the others to proceed to the Eastern Division of the Estate.

The learned High Court Judge had accurately considered those

contradictions and arrived at the correct finding that the marked

contradictions V1-V4 are not forceful enough to attack the root of the case.

(Page 377 of the brief)

The Counsels for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Appellants submitted that the evidence

given by PW1 at the Non-Summary inquiry and before the High Court Judge

holds contradictory positions in relation to who dealt the first blow on the

deceased.

9 | P a g e

According to PW1 the 2nd Appellant had dealt the blow on the back of the

deceased and the 1st Appellant had thrown chilli powder into the eyes of the

deceased and then cut his neck. In the Non-Summary trial, he had stated

that the 1st Appellant had thrown chilli powder onto the face of the deceased

first and the 2nd Appellant had dealt the blow with a wooden club thereafter.

PW1 had given evidence after about 12 years of the incident before the High

Court. Hence one cannot expect him to recount every minute detail of the

incident which had taken place under a terrifying and unexpected situation.

In the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa

(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292 held that,

Witnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling discrepancies

and omissions. When contradictions are marked, the Judge should

direct his attention to whether they are material or not and the witness

should be given an opportunity of explaining the matter...The court

observed further, that human beings are not computers and that it

would be dangerous to disbelieve the witness and reject evidence based

on small contradictions or discrepancies.

The Counsel for the 1st and the 2nd Appellants contends that it is highly

improbable that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Appellants would return from the scene

of crime leaving the dead body from 6.30 p.m. to 3.00 a.m. on the following

day along a foot path that was commonly used by other residents of the

estate.

According to PW1 the incident happened on an uninhabited lonely stretch of

road. Hence it is an untenable argument that the foot path is commonly used

by other residents of the estate.

The Counsel for the 1st and 2nd Appellants contends that the evidence

relating to the manner in which the corps was carried to the place where it

was buried was improbable. He pointed out that as PW1 has stated, the 2nd

10 | P a g e

Appellant had held the trunk of the deceased from the legs (thighs) by one

hand as he was carrying a torch by the other hand and dug a pit of 2x3x3

feet (approximately) by using a mamoty with a blade of 3 x 4 inches within

an approximate period of one hour and buried the dead body.

1st Appellant (even though he was a Kankani) and 2nd Appellant are well

experienced labourers working in the estate. Digging and soil preparation are

daily routine work done in an estate. Hence, the conduct of 1st and 2nd

Appellants with regard to carrying the dead body, digging a pit and burial of

the corpse cannot be considered as improbable events in this case. According

to PW1 the dead body was carried by both of them to the ditch.

The Learned Counsel for the 1st ,2nd and 3rd Appellants argued that there is

an inter-se contradiction existing between the evidence of PW1 and that of

the doctor and the investigating officer in relation to the manner in which

the corpse was buried.

According to PW1, it was only the two legs severed from the torso that were

put inside the urea bag before the burial and the trunk of the deceased was

put into the pit first and the urea bag containing the severed legs was put

over the trunk thereafter. However, as per the evidence given by the doctor-

PW8 and the investigating officer-PW6, at the time of the recovery the entire

body of the deceased including the trunk and two severed legs were found

inside the same urea bag. Further, the said urea bag was tied with a cord

when it was recovered from where it was buried.

PW1 under cross examination stated that he was holding the burning

handmade torch (Pandama) when the burial was done by the 1st and 2nd

Appellants. When the body was taken down to the place where it was buried,

he had dropped the handmade torch. For this the 1st and 2nd Appellants had

said that he too should be buried. Thereafter he had remained silent until

the burial was over.

Page 168 of the brief.

This evidence clearly shows that he did not have the handmade torch in hand

when the final burial was done. Hence, he may not have seen how the body

was finally buried in the ditch. But the witness had very clearly stated how

the burial was done. Considering the circumstances PW1 faced at that time,

I dont think this inter-se contradiction has any bearing on the prosecution

case.

12 | P a g e

The Counsel for the 1st,2nd and 3rd Appellants argued that the medical

evidence does not corroborate the evidence of PW1 in relation to throwing

chilli powder into the eyes of the deceased and the attack on the back of the

deceased.

PW1 clearly stated that he saw the 1st Appellant throwing chilli powder into

the eyes of the deceased after the deceased was struck from his behind by

the 2nd Appellant. PW4 who identified the dead body had noticed that the

eyes of the deceased appeared soggy due to chilli powder being present in

them. But doctor who had examined the dead body had not made any

reference regarding chilli powder in the eyes of the deceased. This is a lapse

on the part of the doctor. This lapse cannot be considered as sufficiently

material to disturb the prosecution case.

In the case of Menoka Malik and others v. The State of West Bengal and

others (2018) 2 SCeJ 1390 held that:

It is by now well settled that the medical evidence cannot override the

evidence of ocular testimony of the witnesses-If there is a conflict

between the ocular testimony and the medical evidence, naturally the

ocular testimony prevails-In other words, where the eye witnesses

account is found to be trustworthy and credible, medical opinion

pointing to alternative possibilities is not accepted as conclusive.

The learned Additional Solicitor General has pointed out that the JMO has

noted an injury on the occipital bone at the base of the skull of the deceased.

Thus, she correctly submitted that there is no contradiction between the

evidence of the eye witness and the medical evidence, as the eye witness had

stated that the deceased was attacked on his back, with a club by the 2nd

Appellant.

The Learned Counsel for the 1st and 2nd Appellants contended that the place

of surreptitious burial of the corpse was identified by the officers of the

Maradana Police Station based upon a statement made by a suspect who

13 | P a g e

was in the custody of the Maradana police. The 3rd and 4th Appellants and

the 5th accused had been taken into custody by the Maradana Police. As none

of the persons who had allegedly participated at this surreptitious burial of

the dead body were taken into custody by the Maradana police, the Counsel

argues that receiving knowledge about the place of burial by the Maradana

Police raises a reasonable doubt.

The incident pertaining to this case has come to light upon the complaint

lodged by PW2 who had suspected about the conduct of the 3rd and 4th

Appellants. The receipt of information about the place of burial by the

Maradana Police cannot be disputed as the 3rd Appellant was present when

the deceased was killed by the 1st and 2nd Appellants. This was confirmed by

PW1 in his evidence.

Therefore, with regard to the grounds of appeal considered above raised by

the Learned Counsel for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Appellants, I am of the view that

those grounds have no merits.

As the 1st ground of appeal of the 3rd Appellant and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

grounds of appeal of the 4th Appellant are connected to the charge of

conspiracy, all those grounds are considered together hereafter.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 3rd Appellant contends that the

evidence given by PW1 only reveals that the 3rd Appellant was merely present

when the murder took placed.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 4th Appellant contends that the 4th

Appellant had come to Dayagama Estate for the purposes of business namely

for selling clothes to the persons in the estate and therefore, drawing an

adverse inference against the 4th Appellant is not justifiable.

According to PW2, it was the 3rd and 4th Appellants who were known to him

from his childhood who had invited him to accompany them to Hatton to

bring back a vehicle from there. PW2 had agreed with his relevant charges.

The van was driven by a driver. After reaching Hatton, they had gone to the

14 | P a g e

estate where the 1st and 2nd Appellants lived and had consumed liquor

together. This was the first time he met the 1st and 2nd Appellants in the

estate. He had gone to play to a nearby ground and when he returned the

1st, 2nd and 3rd Appellants and the driver were not to be seen. Thereafter, in

the evening the 3rd Appellant had given the key of the van in which they

travelled to the estate and told him that they were leaving the estate in the

later the same day. Upon inquiry, the 3rd and 4th Appellants had told him

that the driver of the vehicle had gone back to Colombo in the other van.

Thereafter, the witness had driven the vehicle back to Colombo with the 3rd,

and 4th Appellants and the 5th accused. The 4th Appellant had told him that

the van in question belongs to his boss. Due to the suspicious conduct of the

3rd and 4th Appellants, PW2 had lodged a complaint at the Maradana Police

Station.

A conspiracy occurs when two or more people agree to commit an illegal act

and take some steps towards its completion. Conspiracy is an inchoate crime

because it does not require the illegal act to actually be completed.

Conspiracy is also unique in that, unlike attempt, a defendant can be

charged with both conspiracy to commit a crime, and the crime itself if the

crime is completed.

According to PW1, the 3rd Appellant was present when the deceased was

attacked by the 1st and 2nd Appellants. Hence, the 3rd Appellant was very well

aware that the deceased had been killed when he gave the key of the van to

PW2 to drive the van back to Colombo. Even before leaving Colombo when

headed to Hatton, both the 3rd and 4th Appellants had told PW2 that the

purpose for which he was been taken to Hatton was to bring a van back to

Colombo from Hatton. Hence, this piece of evidence clearly shows that both

the 3rd and 4th Appellants were very well aware about their sinister plan.

Further the 4th Appellant had told PW2 that the van driven by the deceased

belonged to his boss. This clearly shows that he was privy to the commission

of the offence as he was part of the conspiracy.

15 | P a g e

The subsequent conduct of the 3rd and 4th Appellants, which was the 3rd

Appellant giving the keys to the van to PW2 and the 4th Appellant lying to

PW2 that the van belonged to his boss, clearly shows that they were privy to

the crime committed.

The Learned High Court Judge had considered all these matters in his

judgment and correctly concluded that they were guilty of the respective

charges levelled against them. Hence, the grounds considered above also

have no merit.

In the final ground of appeal, the Learned Counsel for the 1st and 2nd

Appellants contends that the learned High Court Judge had failed to give the

benefit of the doubt of the prosecution case to the 1st and 2nd Appellants.

The learned High Court Judge had considered all the evidence presented by

both parties to arrive at his conclusion. He has properly analysed the

evidence in keeping with the standard of proof in a criminal trial and arrived

at a correct finding that the Appellants are guilty of their respective charges

levelled against them. As such, it is incorrect to say that the learned High

Court Judge had not awarded the benefit of the doubt to the 1st and 2nd

Appellants. Therefore, this ground also has no merit.

Considering the final ground of appeal advanced by the 4th Appellant, even

though he had stated in his dock statement that he had gone to the estate

with two other persons for the purposes of carrying out his clothes business,

had taken two different stances when divulging his reasons for the visit.

According to PW1 the 4th Appellant had said that he came to transport a

person who was willing to go abroad. But to PW2, he had said that he was

going to bring a van back to Colombo from Hatton. Further the 4th Appellant

had told PW2 that the van was belonging to his boss. The learned High Court

Judge has considered all the evidence presented before him by both parties

to decide this case. He has provided proper reasoning as to why he accepts

the evidence presented by the prosecution. As the prosecution had led

16 | P a g e

overwhelming evidence in this case, the learned High Court Judge had very

correctly relied on the evidence of the prosecution and convicted the

Appellants of their respective charges. Hence this ground is also sans any

merit.

In the circumstances, I am of the view as there are no merit in the appeals

of the Appellants and therefore their appeals ought to be dismissed. Hence,

I affirm the conviction and sentence of the Appellants and proceed to dismiss

their appeals.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Nuwara Eliya along with the original case record.
