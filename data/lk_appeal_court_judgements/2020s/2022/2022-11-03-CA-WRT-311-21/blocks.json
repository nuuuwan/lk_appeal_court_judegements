The relevant medical report was submitted at the said inquiry.

The Petitioner claims that the said decision is based on fictitious grounds; is in violation of the Principles of Natural Justice; is adverse to the Petitioners Legitimate Expectations and violates the principle against the Duplicity of Punishment (Doctrine of Double Jeopardy).
