The fourteen accused were indicted in the High Court of Chilaw for having

committed the offences of unlawful assembly, the murder of Neville Nuton

Miral and Kaspus Francis Miral and mischief of the property of Neville Nuton

Miral. The first five charges were levelled against the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 10th,

12th, 13th, and 14th accused, under sections 140, 146/296, 32/296 of the Penal

Code.

3

Charge numbers 6, 7, and 8 were levelled against the 1st, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 11th

accused, for having committed the mischief to the property of Neville Nuton

Miral, an offence punishable under sections 146/409 and 32/409.

The 1st, 6th, 8th and 11th accused, had pleaded guilty to the charges levelled

against them and the Judge convicted and sentenced them accordingly. The

case against them was concluded.

Before the trial was concluded, the 2nd, 7th, 9th and 10th accused had died. The

trial proceeded after making necessary changes to the indictment.

After trial, the 5th, 12th and 13th accused were acquitted. The 3rd and 14th

accused were convicted for unlawful assembly and the murder of two persons

were referred to in the indictment, as per counts 1, 2, and 3. The 3rd accused

is the 1st appellant, and the 14th accused is the 2nd appellant. The 1st and 2nd

appellants were sentenced to six months Rigorous Imprisonment for the first

count and sentenced to death for the second and third counts.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the 3rd accused (1st

appellant) and the 14th accused (2nd appellant), appealed to this court.

The facts of the case are briefly as follows:

The deceased Kaspus Francis Miral and Neville Nuton Miral are father and son,

who resided in Kottapitiya Henwewa in Chilaw. The son lived with his wife

(PW1) and ran a small boutique in the front portion of their house. The father,

Kaspus Francis Miral, lived a few yards away from his sons house. On the 31st

of January 1993, around 2.30 p.m a police vehicle from the Chilaw police

station stopped in front of their boutique. About 4 to 5 police officers came in

that vehicle. At that time, PW1 Doreen Manjula Miranda, the wife of the

deceased Neville Nuton Miral was in the boutique. Some officers got down from

the vehicle and they wanted to speak to her husband. PW1 went inside and

informed her husband who was asleep at that time, that the police officers

4

wanted to talk to him. Then the deceased Neville Nuton Miral came out and

spoke to the police officers. After about five minutes, the police officers went

towards the lagoon in the same vehicle in search of illicit arrack. After some

time, the police vehicle came back and stopped near the boutique. They

brought three suspects. Two police officers stayed behind with the suspects.

The police vehicle was driven again towards the lagoon and returned around

4.00 - 5.30 p.m. and took away the suspects and the police officers, who were

waiting near the boutique.

After the police left, about 10 to 15 persons came to the boutique in search of

the deceased Neville Nuton Miral. They abused the deceased, alleging that the

deceased gave information to the police to seize their illicit arrack. They were

armed with knives and clubs. The 7th accused said that he would kill the

deceased. They broke the fence in front of the boutique and pelted stones at

the boutique and assaulted the deceased with bricks. The deceased Neville

Nuton ran to his brothers house, which was situated close by. He informed

his father, the second deceased Kaspus Miral, that he wanted to go to the

police station. The deceased Kaspus Miral thereafter came in a van to their

boutique to accompany them to the Chilaw police station. The two deceased

persons and PW1 got into the van which was driven by PW5 Sebastian.

However, They were not able to proceed more than 150 ft. The 1st and 2nd

appellants (13 and 14 accused) blocked the road by putting their bicycles

across the road. As a result of that they had to stop the vehicle. The accused

then dragged the two deceased out of the van and assaulted them with knives

and clubs and murdered them on the spot. PW1 managed to escape from the

place and was able to inform the police about the incident.

The defence case

The 1st appellant in his evidence stated that, he had attended a wedding in the

morning and had gone to a funeral in the afternoon. He further added that he

was aware of the murder of the two deceased, while he was on his way back

home.

The 2nd appellant gave evidence stating that, he had been at the funeral of his

relative the whole day and he had nothing to do with the murder. He said he

had been in the village, but he was arrested only after about three months.

The first ground of appeal, argued by the counsel for the 1st appellant is that,

the 1st appellant was convicted for murder on the basis of common intention,

and the findings of the learned Trial Judge in this regard are completely

erroneous.

The second ground of appeal is that his own counsel had asked certain

questions implicating the 3rd and 14th accused and thereby, they were denied a

fair trial.

The third ground of appeal is that the learned Trial Judge had compared the

defence evidence with the prosecution evidence, which is wrong in law.

The grounds of appeal relied upon by the 2nd appellant is that the learned High

Court Judge has failed to evaluate the evidence of the appellant and failed to

give reasons for his decision.

The first argument was that the accused was convicted on the basis of common

intention. The appellants were not convicted on the basis of the common

intention. The learned High Court Judge has considered the participation of

each accused in the commission of the crimes. The evidence clearly shows the

participation of the two appellants in committing the crimes (vide pages 180,

181). In the evidence of PW1, the following questions and answers were given.

The argument of the 1st appellant is that even if the 1st appellant had blocked

the van in which the two deceased were travelling at that time, it is not

sufficient to make the appellant liable because there was no evidence to show

that they shared a common intention with the other accused, who caused the

death of the deceased.

Section 146 of the Penal Code is as follows:

8

146. If an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly

in prosecution of the common object of that assembly, or such as the

members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in

prosecution of that object, every person who, at the time of committing

that offence, is a member of the same assembly is guilty of that offence.

Thus, according to section 146, there are two conditions that need to be

satisfied in order for a person to be considered as a member of an unlawful

assembly:

1. The person must be aware of one or more of the six facts, specified in

section 138 of the penal Code which render the assembly unlawful.

2. The person should intentionally join the assembly or continue in it.

In the case of Kulatunga vs Mudalihami 42 NLR 33 stated this;

so far as each individual accused who was concerned, it had to be proved that

he was a member of the unlawful assembly which he intentionally joined. Also

that he knew the common object of the assembly.

In the instant case, there is evidence that the 1st and 2nd appellants were

present at the time of pelting stones at the deceased boutique. The first

appellant actively participated in pelting stones at the house of the deceased.

The two appellants had obstructed the van going forward. The members of the

unlawful assembly had dragged the deceased Kaspus Francis Miral, who was

seated in the front seat of the van. The evidence is that the 1st appellant along

with the 7th accused, assaulted the deceased on the head with clubs. The head

injuries of Kaspus Francis Miral were such that the skull had multiple

fractures and the brain was also damaged accordingly.

9

The only thing that we have got to see is whether the murder was committed in

prosecution of the common object of the assembly, or such, as the members of

that assembly knew that it was likely to be committed.

The members of the unlawful assembly first killed Kaspus Francis Miral and

then took the 2nd deceased out of the van and killed him as well, on the spot.

The learned High Court Judge has observed that the appellants had not been

withdrawn from the assembly at any time. If they were not aware that the

assembly was likely to kill any of the deceased, atleast they could have

withdrawn from it after the first deceased was killed. In these circumstances,

it is not reasonable to infer that they were not aware that the assembly was

likely to cause the death of a person.

Prof. G.L. Peiris, in his book titled Offences Under the Penal Code of Ceylon

second edition at page 32, states as follows:

In Ambalavanar (1892) 1 SCR 271, the accused were charged with being

members of unlawful assembly armed with cudgels and sticks which when

used are likely to cause death. The Trial Court held, as a matter of law, that

cudgels and sticks could not be regarded as weapons likely to cause death

when used as weapons of offence. The Supreme Court reversing this

conclusion, preferred the view that a cudgel or even a stick might be used in

such a way as to cause death and each case should depend on its own facts.

In this case, the evidence is that some of the members had knives and some

had clubs. The doctor described that the injuries caused to the deceased

should have been caused by heavy blunt trauma. The injuries could have been

caused by heavy clubs or an iron bar.

There can be no doubt that when the accused indulged in beating the deceased

with weapons like heavy clubs and knives, they must have known that murder

was likely to be committed. When several persons attacked the deceased with

10

weapons like clubs, with the object of causing him serious injuries, they must

have known that one or the other of those blows may likely cause death.

It is reasonable to infer that the appellants knew that they were likely to kill the

two deceased in these circumstances. As far as the 2nd appellant is concerned,

he should have withdrawn from the unlawful assembly at least after one

person was killed. Of course, the first appellant himself participated in killing

the first deceased. He cannot anyway escape from liability.

It is not necessary to have a pre-plan or pre-meeting of minds. It is sufficient

that the offence was such that, the members knew it was likely to be

committed.

Having considered the evidence of this case, I am satisfied that the appellants

were very well aware that the unlawful assembly was likely to kill the two

deceased. There was nothing to show that the appellants did not share the

common object of the assembly. The appellants were not mere spectators or

passers-by. They actively participated in the unlawful assembly.

For the reasons set out above, I affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed

on the appellants.

The appeal of the accused-appellant is accordingly dismissed.
