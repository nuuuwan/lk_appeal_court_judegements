In response to the above letter, the Appellant informed the CGIR by letter dated 2nd June 2009 that all the requested documents were already submitted to the Inland Revenue Department (hereinafter referred to as the IRD) on several occasions and to the BOR as well. Thereafter, BOR noticed the parties to appear before the Board. But the Appellant was unable to produce information required by the BOR. The Appellants explanation was that all the documents were taken over by the IRD. The Appellant produced the document P10 to substantiate the fact that the documents were taken over by the IRD.

Nevertheless, the Respondent cited the decisions of the Supreme Court in the cases of Guillian v. Commissioner of Income Tax11and Gamini Bus Company v. Commissioner of Income Tax12 and submitted that the onus was on the Appellant to prove that the Assessor's assessment was excessive or erroneous. I do agree with the contention of the Respondent. Yet, the issue is whether the Respondent put the Appellant at a disadvantage and thereafter, placed the burden on the Appellant. The BORs observation to that effect was that the Appellant could have obtained the required documents from the bankers of the subsidiaries, Central Bank, BOI and Customs Department or from other statistical reports. Accordingly, the BOR determined that the Appellant's continued refusal to present the relevant documentation to the Board, despite several opportunities had been offered to the Appellant, the Board had no alternative, but to confirm the assessments and dismiss the appeal.",

The Appellant, in the said written submissions asserted that the shareholders of the Appellant company and the other two companies are the same, but these two companies are independent companies registered with the BOI and have signed agreements under section 17 of the BOI Act. In contrast to its previous positions, the Appellant submitted that the two companies are not subsidiaries of the Appellant. At the outset the Appellants position was that both companies are subsidiaries of the Appellant company16. The Appellant later stated that they were associated companies of the appellant17. In fact, there was no evidence before the Court that the Appellant company possesses shares of both companies and that it had the power to control as a holding company. Be that as it may, even if the two companies are subsidiaries of the Appellant company, the three companies are legally recognized as separate legal entities and their tax and debt are paid by the individual company.",
