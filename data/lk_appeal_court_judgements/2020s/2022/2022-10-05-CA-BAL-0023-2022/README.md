MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant matter has been filed under the Provisions of the Assistance

to and Protection of Victim and Crime Witness Act No: 04 of 2015 to

obtain bail the suspect namely, Sumith Chanaka Priyashantha.

The Complainant in the instant matter has lodged a complaint against the

suspect for assault on 24. 10 2020 but the suspect had been granted bail

on 30.10.2020. The suspect and the complainant are relatives and there

had been a longstanding land dispute between the two parties and action

under section 66 of the Primary Court act has been instituted and the

Magistrates Court of Rathnapura had delivered the order on 17.8.2021,

and subsequently action under section 73 of the Primary Courts Act also

has been filed against the suspect.

In the meantime the complainant had lodged a complaint against the

suspect for allegedly lighting crackers in front of his house and posing a

threat on 23.2.2022, and the police had reported facts under the above

mentioned act on 8.3.2022 and the suspect had been remanded. The

main contention of the Counsel for the Suspect is that there was a land

dispute between the relations and facts have been reported under the

abovementioned act but the nature of the complaint does not fall within

the ambit of the act.

The State Counsel appearing for the Attorney General vehemently

objected to the application and stated that the Suspect had been

enlarged on bail by the Magistrate for the offence of assault and

thereafter the Suspect had violated the bail conditions and had

committed the instant offence.

But what surprises this Court is that if a Suspect violates a bail

conditions the most prudent thing the police could have done was to

report facts to the Magistrate and taken steps to remand the suspect.

But instead the police have reported facts under the abovementioned

act and had remanded the suspect. When Court brought this matter to

the notice of the state counsel, the counsel conceded. Therefore, this

Court observes that in the instant matter, the police had violated the

main purpose of the act.

It is very clearly stated in the act that the act has been enacted to safe

guard the rights of the victim and witnesses, but in the instant matter

by producing the suspect under this act we note that the police had

made use of this act in order to remand the Suspect which this Court

notes with disapproval. It is further noted with disapproval that the State

Page 5 of 6

condoned this act by the police and made the above submissions. The

role of the Attorney General is to be amicus to Court but not to defend

the police at all time.

Hence in view of the reasons stated above this Court is of the view that

the suspect named in the application should be granted bail on the

following conditions,

1) A cash bail of Rs 50000/

2) Two Sureties to the value of 100000/each

3) The suspect to report to the relevant police on every last Sunday of

the month,

4) The suspect is severely warned not to interfere with the Complainant

or the family members, and if it is reported the instant bail order would

stand annulled.

As such the instant application for bail is allowed and the Registrar of this

Court is hereby directed to convey the instant order to the relevant

Magistrates Court.
