3. On or about 18th of August 2006 in the course of the same

transaction as the 1st count the Appellant being a Public Servant

employed as the Principal of Wickramaseela Madya Maha

Vidyalaya in Giriulla was indicted for accepting a gratification in

the sum of Rs.40,000/- from Moragoda Vithanage Deepthi

Dammika to enrol her child Sachini Chamodya to Grade 01 of

the said school which is an offence punishable under section

19(b) of the Bribery Act.

4. In the course of the same transaction as the 3rd count the

Appellant being a Public Servant employed as the Principal of

Wickramaseela Madya Maha Vidyalaya in Giriulla was indicted

for accepting a sum of Rs.40,000/- from Moragoda Vithanage

Deepthi Dammika which is an offence punishable under section

19(c) of the Bribery Act.

After the trial the Appellant was found guilty under all counts and the

Learned High Court Judge of Colombo on 07/03/2018 has imposed the

following sentences:

1. For every count a fine of Rs.5,000/- with a default sentence of 3

months simple imprisonment.

2. For every count 4 months rigorous imprisonment (16 months

rigorous imprisonment) and the same was suspended for 7

years.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic.

4 | P a g e

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. The Learned High Court Judge has convicted the Appellant based on

the prejudice of Bad Character unsupported by evidence.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has rejected the evidence given by the

Appellant on an incorrect legal basis.

3. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the evidence given

by four defence witnesses.

4. The trial judge has failed to appreciate the defence position.

5. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the reasonable

doubt that has arisen in the prosecution case itself.

Background of the case.

In this case PW01 Deepthi Dammika, mother of the child in her evidence

stated that as she wanted her daughter to be admitted to Wickramaseela

Madya Maha Vidyalaya in Giriulla. Her husband PW04 Ajith

Thewarapperuma, a Naval Officer, had gone to the said school and had a

preliminary discussion with the Appellant regarding his daughters school

admission. As per the direction of her husband PW01 had gone to the

Appellants house on 01/08/2006 with a neighbour for further discussions

so as to finalize the school admission. The Appellant during the discussion

which took place at his residence had informed PW01 to bring Rs.40,000/-

in order to procure her daughters school admission. When she informed this

to her husband (PW04) he had lodged a complaint with the Bribery

Commission. After completing all formalities, the officials of the Bribery

Commission had organized the detection which was executed on

18/08/2006 at the school premises. PW02 WPS Surangani acted as the

decoy in this case.

5 | P a g e

The Bribery Officials had provided the requested funds of Rs.40,000/- to

PW01 and PW01 had gone to the school with PW02 and handed over the

money to the Appellant in his office. The Appellant after accepting the money

put the same into the drawer of the table. At that time the officials of the

Bribery Commission had gone into the Appellants office and recovered the

money from his table drawer.

All witnesses called by the prosecution had properly corroborated the

evidence of PW01 and PW02.

PW07 Mohideen Salahaudeen Director of School Services of the Ministry of

Education has confirmed that apart from facility fees, principals were not

allowed to take money when new students are admitted to schools. To

substantiate his position a circular dated 23/05/2006 issued by Ministry of

Education was marked as P7 by the prosecution. During the cross

examination he admitted that a circular marked as V5 was also issued by

the Education Ministry but further said at the time pertaining to this case

the marked circular V5 had been cancelled by the Ministry of Education. But

the prosecution had failed to confirm this with documentary evidence.

After the conclusion of the prosecution case the defence was called. The

Appellant elected to give evidence from the witness box and called 04 more

witnesses to support his case.

Considering the first ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the trial

judge had considered evidence pertaining to bad character which highly

influenced the outcome of this case.

In the remaining grounds the Appellant contends that the defence evidence

was not properly considered by the trial judge. As the remaining three appeal

grounds are similar in nature as they are based on defence evidence being

disregarded and standard of proof in a criminal trial, those three grounds

will be considered together in this judgment if necessary.

6 | P a g e

The Appellant giving evidence stated his qualifications and work experiences

in the field of education. Further he had said that he had rose to this position

with much sacrifices and difficulties. He also said that he has two daughters

who had had their education in Russia and that the elder daughter was

working as a doctor in Sri Lanka.

The learned High Court judge in his judgment at page 771 of the brief has

described the Appellant as a person who as a practice request and obtain

money to admit students to the school he works at. He further stated that

the defence evidence revealed that the Appellant had spent lots of money for

his childrens costly education abroad and that there is heavy spending

which goes over and above the earnings from a usual government salary.

This adverse reference had totally been made by unsupported evidence and

are assumptions of the trial judge. Now I will consider how this reference

which amounts to bad character of the Appellant affects the fair trial and

prejudice the defence case.

According to Section 53 of the Evidence Ordinance in criminal proceedings

the fact that the person accused is of a good character is relevant.

According to Section 54 of the Evidence Ordinance in criminal proceedings

the fact that the person accused is of a bad character is irrelevant, unless

evidence has been given that he has a good character, in which case it

becomes relevant.

When the Character of the Appellant had not been put in issue during the

trial, the adverse reference made against the Appellant by the trial judge in

his judgement has caused a serious miscarriage of justice. Further the

adverse reference had been made by the trial judge on the unsupported and

uncorroborated evidence presented during the trial.

7 | P a g e

E.R.S.R.Coomarasawamy in his book The Law of Evidence Volume I at

page 684 states that:

The principle underlying the rule is that hardship is possible, as

evidence of bad character may lead the mind of the judge or jury away

from the point to be decided, namely, the guilt or innocence of the

accused person in regard to the particular offence with which he is

charged. The main ground is prejudice.

In Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecution (1935) A.C. 309, Lord Sankey,

L.C. said:

The mere fact that a man has been charged with an offence is no proof

that he committed the offence. Such a fact is, therefore irrelevant; it goes

neither to show that the prisoner did the acts for which he is actually

being tried nor does it go to his credibility as a witness. Such questions

must therefore, be excluded on the principle which is fundamental in the

law of evidence as conceived in this country, especially in criminal

cases, because if allowed, they are likely to lead the minds of the jury

astray into false issues; not merely do they trend to introduce suspicion

as if it were evidence, but they trend to distract the jury from the true

issue, namely whether the prisoner in fact committed the offence on

which he is actually standing the trial.

In The King v. Pila 15 NLR 453 held:

that the evidence called to prove that the accused were by repute men

of bad character and were generally feared by the villagers was

inadmissible

The underlying principle in these cases are that no evidence regarding the

bad character of an accused should directly or indirectly become part of the

proceedings in a criminal case.

8 | P a g e

In a criminal trial when evidence of bad character of an accused has been

led in evidence, it is the profound duty of the trial judge to stop such

questioning immediately. He must ensure that no character evidence goes

into the proceedings at any stage of the trial.

In Moses v. Queen 75 NLR 121 the court held:

Conviction of the Appellant must be quashed on the ground that the

evidence of the previous conviction, which was inadmissible according

to section 54 of Evidence ordinance, had been taken into account in the

trial judges judgment and was in a high degree prejudicial to the

Appellant. In such a case the substantial question is whether or not the

accused has been deprived of a fair trial.

In a criminal trial if inadmissible evidence is admitted by the trial judge at

any stage not only does such evidence go into the proceedings but it will

greatly prejudice the accuseds interests and affect his right to a fair trial.

In this case the learned High Court judge adversely commented on the

Appellants character in his judgment. The comments the trial judge made

fall completely outside of the evidence adduced by both parties. This clearly

shows the highly prejudiced opinion formed against the Appellant by the

learned trial judge at the time of writing the judgment. In my view the

prejudicial mindset of the learned High Court judge has caused serious

miscarriage of justice in this case.

As the first appeal ground has merit and greatly affect the judgment of the

trial court, it is not necessary for this court to consider the remaining

grounds of appeal raised by the Learned Counsel for the Appellant.

Now I consider whether this is an appropriate case to be sent for re-trial. The

pros and cons of sending a case for re-trial have been discussed in several

cases including the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.

9 | P a g e

In Nandana v.The Attorney General 2008 (1) SLR 51 held:

The mis-statements of law by the trial judge would be tantamount to a

denial of a fundamental right of any accused as enshrined in Art 13(5)

of the Constitution.

The Court further held:

(2)A discretion is vested in the Court whether or not to order a re-trial

in a fit case, which discretion should be exercised judicially to satisfy

the ends of justice taking into consideration the nature of the evidence

available, the time duration. Since the date of appeal, the period of

incarceration the accused had already suffered, the trauma and

hazards an accused person would have to suffer in being subject to a

second trial for no fault on his part and the resultant traumatic effect in

his immediate family members who have no connection to the alleged

crime, should be considered.

In The Attorney General v. Bimbirigodage Sujith Lal SC Appeal 14/2016

decided on 20/02/2018 the Court considered the following paragraph from

the Court of Appeal judgment.

A long delay to finally conclude the matter is a relevant factor to be

taken into consideration. The conviction and sentence may be so

deserving. But court cannot forget the fact that when a fresh trial is

ordered by the Appellate Court the accused is tried for the second time,

and the process to be undertaken all over again. The second trial if at

all would be after a long lapse of time of over 17 years.

In this case the incident happened on 01/06/2006, almost 16 years ago. The

date of judgment of this case was delivered on 07/03/2018. To conclude the

first trial, it took about 12 years. One cannot expect perfect recollection of

events from witnesses almost 16 years after an incident.

10 | P a g e

The Appellant in his evidence took up the position that he had powers to

accept donations to the school upon the admission of new students. With

regards to this incident PW01 had come to his house to discuss her childs

school admission as the school was suddenly closed down due to a bomb

explosion in Colombo. When she came to the school with another woman,

following a short discussion with the principal, she had been requested to

make a donation to the school under the past-pupil category. The Appellant

had accepted Rs.40,000/- and when he was about to issue the receipt, the

Bribery officials had arrested him at that time. The Appellant accepted the

money as PW01 had told him that she was in a hurry and she unable to go

to the bank to deposit the same in the school development account.

According to the Appellant as per the Education Ministry circular No.24 of

2001 and its subsequent amendment by circular number 23/2003 the

acceptance of money for school development has not been prohibited. As

such he had accepted the money given by PW01 and issued the receipt.

According to defence witness 03 Malkanthi Hugo the money which had been

accepted by the Appellant as a donation. A receipt will be issued when money

is accepted and the same will be deposited in the bank account on the

following day. The prosecution has not produced the circular which had been

issued to cancel the circular No.2001 of 24.

The Appellant was in remand for about 02 months before he was granted

bail initially.

In Queen v. G. K. Jayasinghe 69 NLR 314 the court held that:

We have considered whether we should order a new trial in this case.

We do not take that course, because there has been already a lapse of

over three years since the commission of the offences,.

In this case the learned High Court judge has added adverse character

evidence of the Appellant in his judgment. The comments made by the trial

11 | P a g e

judge are completely outside of the evidence adduced by both parties which

definitely affect the root of the case. Further, the prosecution has failed to

mark the document which support the cancellation of the Education Ministry

circular No.2001 of 24 in which the Appellant argued that he had the

authority to accept donations for the development of the school. Now, nearly

16 years had passed following the commission of the offence.

Considering the above factors, this court has come to a conclusion that this

is not a fit and proper case to order a re-trial.

For the reasons stated above, I allow the appeal and set aside the conviction

and sentence imposed on the Appellant.

The Appellant is acquitted from all the charges.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court

of Colombo along with the original case record.
