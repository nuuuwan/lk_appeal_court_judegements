Before: Hon. Justice Pradeep Kirtisinghe Hon. Justice Mayadunne Corea For the Petitioner: Dharshana Weraduwage with Dhanushi Kalupahana and Ushani Atapattu. Decided on: 25.04.2022 Judgement

The Petitioner is seeking for injunctions under and in terms of Article 143 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, preventing the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents from taking any steps to encash the bank guarantees marked X3A - X3B and preventing 7th 10th Respondents from taking steps to encash the same bank guarantees and such other interim reliefs prayed for in the petition.

The Petitioner which is a limited liability Company, had entered into a contract with the Ministry of Urban Development, Water Supplies and Housing Facilities which is marked as X2. Thereafter, the Petitioner Company had started the construction work in pursuant to the contract. It appears that there had been a delay of performance under the contract and after several correspondence between the two parties, the secretary to the Ministry had terminated the contract as evidenced by the letter marked X8. The main submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that, the aforesaid termination of the contract is illegal. He submitted that the contract was entered between the Petitioner Company and the Ministry of Urban Development, Water Supply and Housing Facilities and the secretary of the Ministry is not authorized to terminate the said contract. It was his submission that the approval of the Minister in charge of the subject, was never obtained before the termination.

In the case of Hemas Marketing (Pvt) Limited Vs Chandrasiri and others (1994) 2 SLR 181 Dr. Ranaraja J has observed as follows, When a bank has given a guarantee, it is required to honor it according to its terms and is not concerned whether either party to the contract which underlay the contract was in default. The whole purpose of such commercial instruments was to provide security which was to be readily, promptly and assuredly realisable when the prescribed event occurred. The only exception to the rule is where fraud by one of the parties to the underlying contract has been established and the bank had notice of the fraud. A mere plea of fraud would in for the purpose of brining the case within this exception and which rests in the uncorroborated statements of the applicant will not suffice. In that judgement Dr. Ranaraja J further observed as follows, It is only in exceptional circumstances that Courts will interfere with the machinery of obligations assumed by the banks. They are the lifeblood of international commerce. Such obligations are regarded as collateral to underlying rights and obligations between merchants at either end of the banking chain. Courts will leave the merchants to settle their disputes under the contract by litigation.

The same principle was accepted by S.N Silva J in Indica Traders (Pvt) Limited Vs. Seoul Lanka Constructions (Pvt) Limited and others (1994) 3 SLR 387. In this case, there is no evidence of fraud on the part of the Respondents and there is no evidence that the Respondents

banks had knowledge of such a fraud. There is no allegation of fraud in this case. Therefore, this Court cannot grant an injunction preventing the aforementioned Respondents from taking steps to encash the aforesaid guarantee bonds. If there is a violation of the contract the parties can settle their disputes under the contract by a separate action in the District Court.

For the aforementioned reasons we dismiss this application for a constitutional injunction under and in terms of Article 143 of the Constitution.
