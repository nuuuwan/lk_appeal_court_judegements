This is a revision application filed on 12.11.2018 by the 5th accused

petitioner (hereinafter the petitioner) named in the indictment dated

24.01.2018 filed by the complainant-respondent in the High Court of

Colombo in case bearing No. HC/57/2018. The instant application

impugns an order dated 23.07.2018 delivered by the High Court of

Colombo which relates to an objection raised by the petitioner under and

CA-CPA-124-18 Page 3 of 11 31/03/2022 IJ-15-22

in terms of the Evidence (Special) Provisions Act No. 14 of 1995 (hereinafter

the Act).

The background facts of the case are as follows. The petitioner along with

5 other accused were indicted for conspiracy to commit criminal

misappropriation of Rs. 1,090,000/- out of the funds belonging to the

Fisheries Harbour Corporation which constitute offences under the Penal

Code and Offences Against Public Property Act No 12 of 1982 (as

amended). The petitioner was the Chairman of the Corporation at the time

of the said misappropriation and allegations have been levelled that he was

involved in ordering and purchasing of 2000 Diaries violating the tender

procedure which ought to be followed in such procurement. The

indictment was preferred upon an investigation conducted by the Criminal

Investigation Department in pursuance to an investigation and inquiry

held by the Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious

Acts, Fraud, Corruption, Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges

appointed by His Excellency the President in 2015.

As such, proceedings in High Court case bearing No. HC/57/2018 began

on 12.06.2018 with the serving of indictment upon the petitioner and the

five accused respondents. On that day itself 12.06.2018, the respondent

proposed to tender computer evidence and issued notice to the petitioner

of such proposal under Section 7 (1) (a) of the Act. On 18.06.2018, the

petitioner applied to be permitted to access the proposed computer

evidence as per the stipulations of Section 7(1)(b) of the Act. At this

juncture, this Court would pause the narration of facts and refer to the

provisions of Section 7(1)(a) and 7(1)(b) of the Act. Section 7(1)(a) of the Act

is reproduced below:

The following provisions shall apply where any party to a

proceeding proposes to tender any evidence under section 4 or 5, in

such proceeding-

CA-CPA-124-18 Page 4 of 11 31/03/2022 IJ-15-22

(a) the party proposing to tender such evidence shall, not later than forty-

five days before the date fixed for inquiry or trial file, or cause to be

filed, in court, after notice to the opposing party, a list of such evidence as

is proposed to be tendered by that party, together with a copy of such

evidence or such particulars thereof as is sufficient to enable the party to

understand the nature of the evidence; (Emphasis added)

By virtue of invoking Section 7(1)(a) of the Act on 12.06.2018, the

complainant-respondent has set in motion a legal process by which the

petitioner is granted an opportunity to inspect the nature of the computer

evidence sought to be produced by the prosecution against the accused

and prepare accordingly prior to the date fixed for inquiry or trial. This is

akin to the recent introduction of Pretrial Conference by Section 3 of Code

of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, No. 2 of 2022 by which Section

195A was inserted to the principal enactment. As such, the legal process

set in motion by the invocation of Section 7(1)(a) aims at facilitating the

inspection of computer evidence that is proposed to be produced during

trial, prior to the beginning of such trial. As such, the Section makes it

mandatory for the proposing party to tender notice of such computer

evidence to the opposing party 45 days prior to the trial date. It is the

intention of the legislature that within the confines of such 45 days, the

necessary and meaningful access is facilitated to the opposing party to

access and otherwise inspect the proposed computer evidence. When

evaluating the facts of the instant case, notice of such proposed computer

evidence was given to the petitioners lawyer and it is the considered view

of this Court that such notice sufficiently fulfills the requirements of

Section 7(1)(a) of the Act.

Then comes Section 7(1)(b) of the Act which stipulates the following:

any party to whom a notice has been given under the preceding

provision may, within fifteen days of the receipt or such notice

CA-CPA-124-18 Page 5 of 11 31/03/2022 IJ-15-22

apply to the party giving such notice, to be permitted access to, and

to

(i) the evidence ought to be produced;

(ii) the machine, device or computer, may be, used to produce the evidence;

(iii) any records relating to the production of the evidence, or the system

used in such production; (Emphasis added)

As such, the opposing party may, if they so choose, apply by way of a

notice to be permitted to access the computer evidence proposed to be

produced within 15 days of the receipt of notice under Section 7(1)(a) of

the Act. After the fulfillment of Section 7(1)(b) requirement, Section 7(1)(c)

stipulates that within reasonable time but not later than 15 days, the

proposing party must grant such access:

(c) upon receipt of the application to be permitted access to, and to

inspect such evidence, machine, device, computer, records or system,

the party proposing to tender such evidence shall, within

reasonable time, but not later than fifteen days after the receipt

of the application, comply with the request and provide a reasonable

opportunity to the party applying or his agents or nominees, to have

access to, and inspect, such evidence, machine, device, computer,

records or systems, as is mentioned in the application;

As such, the combined effect of Sections 7(1)(a), 7(1)(b) and 7(1)(c) is to

ensure that the proposing party grants access to the opposing party to

inspect the proposed computer evidence 15 days before a date is fixed for

trial. However, the legislature in its wisdom as provided the following as in

Section 7(1)(d) as well:

where the party proposing to tender such evidence is unable to

comply, or does not comply with, the application for access

and inspection, or where the parties are unable to agree on

CA-CPA-124-18 Page 6 of 11 31/03/2022 IJ-15-22

any matter relating to the notice or the application for access and

inspection or the manner and extent of the inspection, the court may

on application made by either party, make such order or give such

direction, as the interests of justice may require. (Emphasis

added)

Hence, the legislature has provided an avenue for further facilitation in the

event the proposing part is unable to comply or does not comply with the

application for access under Section 7(1)(c) or even independent to Section

7(1)(c), when the parties are facing an obstacle to arrive at a consensus as

to the modalities of inspection, the Court is granted the discretion to issue

a suitable directive in the interest of justice. This is the only meaningful

interpretation of Section 7(1)(a), 7 (1)(b), 7(1)(c) and 7(1)(d). While it is

mandatory for the proposing party to give notices of the intended

production of computer evidence when the trial begins, the timelines

stipulated by the legislature act as a guideline to intimate when and upon

which conditions the other party may approach the court with their

requests for the meaningful facilitation of access to the proposed computer

evidence.

Prior to examining the relevant facts of the instant case in relation to the

application of the Sections thus far adduced, a brief reference to whether

the stipulations of Section 7(1)(c) are mandatory or directory, must be

had. Though neither party canvassed this contention beyond the written

submissions, it is the considered view of this Court that despite the use of

shall in Section 7(1)(c) of the Act, the legislature intended the provisions

to have only have directive effect. As Lord Campbell pointed out

in Liverpool Borough Bank v. Turner (1860) 2 De G. F. & F. 502;30 L.J.

Ch. 379 "No universal rule can be laid down for the construction of statutes

as to whether mandatory enactments shall be

considered directory only or obligatory with an implied nullification for

disobedience. It is the duty of courts of justice to try to get at the real

intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the

statute to be construed". (See also Mohommed v Jayarathne (2002) 3 SLR

CA-CPA-124-18 Page 7 of 11 31/03/2022 IJ-15-22

181, Abeygunewardena v Samoon (2007) 1 SLR 276, Wickremasinghe v.

de Silva (1979) 2 SLR 65, Visuvalingam And Others V. Liyanage And

Others (1983) 1 SLR 203, Thilanga Sumathipala v Inspector General of

Police and Others (2004) 1 SLR 210, Sumanadasa and 205 Others v

Attorney General (2006) 3 SLR 202), See also Maxwell Interpretation of

Statutes, 10th Edition, Page 47 and Page 58.) It is an elementary rule that

construction is to be made of all the parts together, and not of one part

only by itself. It is clearly resolved in Canada Sugar Refining Co, Ltd vs

R [1898] A.C.735 Every clause of a statue is to be construed with reference

to the context and other clauses of the Act, so as, as far as possible, to make

a consistent of the whole statute. Further in, Midland Bank vs Conway

B.C. [1965] 1 W.L.R. 1165 states a case in which the principle that word

should be read in their context prevailed over argument based on the literal

wording of the Act and the purpose of the provision in question.

Now to the facts. As referred to above, the respondent invoked the

provisions of Section 7(1)(a) by giving notice to the petitioner on

12.06.2018. The petitioner, relying on Section 7(1)(b) issued notices to the

respondent on 18.06.2018. On 09.07.2018, as evinced by Page 38 of the

Brief, the petitioner raised an objection to prevent the leading of computer

evidence as proposed by the respondent, stating that by virtue of the

respondents non-compliance to the time period stipulated in Section

7(1)(c) of the Act, the respondent can no longer rely on such computer

evidence when the trial begins. This objection was premised on the basis

that by virtue of noncompliance, the respondent has violated the

mandatory requirement of the stipulated 15 days, reasonable time period

as provided for in Section 7 (1) (c) of the Act, thus frustrating the law and

negating the intention of the legislature. Thereafter the impugned order

dated 23.07.2018 was delivered by the learned High Court Judge,

overruling the said objection and directing the parties to come into an

agreement in order to facilitate access to the proposed computer evidence.

CA-CPA-124-18 Page 8 of 11 31/03/2022 IJ-15-22

In the impugned order dated 23.07.2018, the learned High Court Judge

rejects the contention that in the event access has not been granted by the

expiration of 15 days since Section 7(1)(b) notice, the proposing party

under Section 7 (1) (a) is estopped from leading the special evidence. The

said order refers to stipulation of reasonable time period within Section 7

of the Act as recognition of the practical difficulties in implementing the

provision by the legislature. The learned High Court judge refuses to

employ a strict interpretation of the time bar envisioned in Section 7 (1) (c)

of the Act and opines that if the converse is expected, the petitioner should

have specified the modalities of the access requested. The learned High

Court Judge in conclusion pronounced the following and ordered the

matter to be called on 29.08.2018.

.

. (Page 31

of the appeal brief)

It is the considered view of this Court that the impugned order dated

23.07.2018 is an instance where the learned High Court Judge has issued

a directive under

Section 7(1)(d) of the Act to facilitate access of inspection to the petitioner

with regard the proposed computer evidence by the respondent. The

learned High Court Judge has utilised his discretion as envisioned by the

legislature when enacting the provisions of the Act. However, such

discretion must be employed in a manner that does not frustrate the due

administration of justice. The Presidents Counsel appearing on behalf of

CA-CPA-124-18 Page 9 of 11 31/03/2022 IJ-15-22

the petitioner vigorously asserted that the learned High Court Judge, by

failing to demarcate specific deadlines by which the proposing party ought

to comply with the request for access in the impugned order, the

meaningful operation of the law has been thwarted.

At this juncture, it is pertinent to refer to proceedings dated 29.09.2018

where the respondent has offered the opportunity for the petitioner to

inspect the proposed computer evidence. However, the brief notes that the

petitioner has refused the offer by relying on their previous objection that

by virtue of non-compliance of Section 7(1)(c) of the Act, any attempt by

the respondent to permit access has been rendered nugatory. It appears

that the petitioner was not even to willing entertain the idea of inspecting

the proposed computer evidence prior to the beginning of the trial.

In this regard, the submissions by the learned Deputy Solicitor General

(DSG) appearing on behalf of the respondent is of value. It was the DSGs

contention that the respondent is attempting to completely shut out the

proposed computer evidence and thereby necessarily quashing the

indictment against the petitioner since the sustainability of the very

prosecution depends on the proposed documents. DSG then went on to

refer to the specificities of the proposed computer evidence sought to be

produced and stated that they were printouts of documents in the nature

of quotations involved in the alleged conspiracy for criminal

misappropriation. Reference was also made to the signatures placed on

such documents and how the same documents were available to the

petitioner during the Commission of Inquiry and by virtue of such access,

no prejudice has been caused to the petitioner. Thereafter the learned DSG

referred to the practical challenges the respondent faced in issuing notices

under Section 7(1)(a) of the

Act to all 6 accused (including the petitioner) of the case and the manner

in which they were awaiting the response from each such accused. It was

further contended that the admissibility of evidence is a trial matter and

CA-CPA-124-18 Page 10 of 11 31/03/2022 IJ-15-22

that by raising the instant objection, the petitioner is attempting to shut

out evidence.

During his submissions, the Presidents Counsel for the petitioner stated

that the present issue was a pure question of law. However, this Court

cannot ignore the factual background and the effect of the objection raised

for that would necessarily have an impact on the overall administration of

justice. Facts cannot be completely divorced of the law or vice versa.

Especially at an instance where the discretion of a judge is being

questioned which would necessarily have the effect of shutting out

evidence even prior to the beginning of the trial. At this instance, this Court

would like to reproduce a quote by Riddel J in R v Barnes 60 Dominion

Law Reports 623 at 628 which was cited in the Supreme Court Judgment

of Abeysekera v Attorney General 2008 [BLR] 81:

the administration of our laws is not a game in which the cleverer

and more astute is to win, but a serious proceeding by a people in

earnest to discover the actual facts for the sake of public safety

In such a context, this Court will refer to Section 7(2) of the Act which

stipulates the following:

Save as provided for in sections 8 and 9 where any party proposing

to tender any evidence under the provisions of this Act, fails to give

notice as aforesaid, or upon application being made for access and

inspection, fails to provide a reasonable opportunity therefor, or fails

to comply with any order or direction given, by court under paragraph

(a), such party shall not be permitted to tender such evidence in

respect of which the failure was occasioned

It is the considered view of this Court that the circumstances of this

instant case do not warrant the invocation of Section 7(2) of the Act. As

determined by the learned High Court Judge in his impugned order dated

CA-CPA-124-18 Page 11 of 11 31/03/2022 IJ-15-22

23.07.2018, the computer evidence proposed to be led by a party in a

criminal trial under the Evidence (Special) Provisions Act No. 14 of 1995,

cannot be shut out on an objection based on non-compliance of Section

7(1)(c) of the Act, in an instant where the High Court has delivered a

directive to facilitate access to the proposed evidence. The lack of a specific

deadline or a period of compliance ought not vitiate the entire process of

justice as crimes of this nature has grave impact on the public interest.

The vagueness in the time period within which the directive ought to be

satisfied should not render nugatory the administration of justice.

Nevertheless, in exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court, the

learned High Court Judge is hereby directed to clearly stipulate a

timeframe within which access for inspection of the proposed computer

evidence should be facilitated under the Act by the meaningful application

of Section 7(1)(d) of the Act, before commencement of the trial.

Application dismissed.
