Judgment

This Appeal emanates from the Order of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden

in Colombo in case bearing No. HCRA 202/2014, where the 2nd Party-Petitioner-Appellant

canvassed the Order of the learned Magistrate of Nugegoda acting as the Primary Court Judge in

case bearing No. 1789/ (66).

It appears that the information was filed by the Officer-in-Charge of Mirihana Police Station in

terms of Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act on 29.05.2014. After following the

relevant procedure stipulated in the said Act, the matter was fixed for inquiry. At the conclusion

of the Inquiry, the learned Magistrate of Nugegoda acting as the Primary Court Judge, declared

Page 3 of 6

that the 1st Party-Respondent was entitled to the possession of the subject matter as at the date on

which the information was filed.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the 2nd Party-Petitioner had invoked the revisionary jurisdiction

of the Provincial High Court of Colombo. The learned High Court Judge of Colombo affirmed the

Order of the learned Magistrate of Nugegoda dated 05.10.2014 by his Order dated 20.10.2012.

Having been dissatisfied with the said Order of the learned High Court Judge, the 2nd Party-

Petitioner-Appellant has preferred this appeal.

The facts of the instant case are as follows;

The 1st Party-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Respondent), has

made a complaint to the Police Station of Mirihana against the 2nd Party-Petitioner-Appellant

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant), alleging that the Appellant had intruded the

land in dispute which had been possessed by the 1st Party-Respondent and also that the Appellant

had started constructing a building on the said land.

It was the contention of the Appellant that on the day of the incident, the 2nd Party-Petitioner-

Appellant was constructing a building for his temple on the disputed land that he had been in

possession of, continuously for over thirty years upon a valid legal title.

However, after the conclusion of the inquiry, the learned Magistrate held that the 1st Party-

Respondent had been dispossessed within a period of two months immediately prior to the date on

which the information was filed in terms of Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act and

was restored to possession under Section 68 of the said Act. In view of Section 68 of the act, it is

the duty of the Primary Court Judge to ascertain and determine who had been in possession of the

land in dispute as at the date of filing of the information and make an Order as to who is entitled

to possession of such land and part thereof.

The learned Primary Court Judge, having given consideration to the information filed by the

Mirihana Police, affidavits, counter affidavits and the documents filed by the 1st Party-Respondent

and the 2nd Party-Petitioner Appellant, had determined that 1st Party-Respondent is entitled to

Page 4 of 6

possession of the land in dispute and also decided that neither the 2nd Party-Petitioner-Appellant

nor 2nd Intervening Party is entitled to the possession of the land in dispute.

It was alleged by the Appellant that the learned Primary Court Judge had not properly weighed the

evidentiary value of the documents marked on behalf of the 2nd Party-Petitioner-Appellant in

substantiating his possession over the disputed land.

It is worthy to note the documents tendered by the Appellant in the Magistrates Court. The

document 21 is a Deed of Declaration and 24 is a Deed of Gift and 28 is a Lease Agreement.

It appears that 22 is a letter-requesting approval to filling of a paddy field and 23 is a cash

receipt issued by the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation. The document 25 is a

letter sent by Central Environmental Authority to Commissioner General-Buddhist Affairs, and

26 is a letter sent to Appellant by the Department of Buddhist Affairs. Moreover, 29 is a

statement made by the Grama Niladhari, which states that the disputed land is one owned by the

temple of the Appellant.

When deciding who is entitled to possession of the land in dispute, it is apparent that the contents

of the said documents 21, 22, 23, 24, 26 and 29 do not substantiate that the Appellant

was in possession of the disputed portion of land on the date of filing of the information. The

documents 210-210, 210, 210, 210 and 210 are the affidavits given by the

neighbours from the houses adjacent to the disputed land stating that it was the Appellant who was

in possession of the disputed land and not the Respondent.

These affidavits also stated that since year 2008, the 2nd Party Intervenient (the person who carried

on a garage in the disputed land) was also in the possession of the disputed land under the

permission of the Appellant. Moreover, the 2nd Party Intervenient had admitted that he was

maintaining his garage in the disputed land with permission of the 1st Party-Respondent-

Respondent as per the document marked 213.

It is worthy to note the letter 27, which was sent to the Appellant by the Assistant Commissioner-

Buddhist Affairs, which states that the Viharadhipathi had informed the Appellant that the

impugned garage is not being carried out on a land belonging to the Navinna Raja Maha Viharaya.

Hence, it appears that the contents of the said affidavits are misleading. Thus, the learned

Magistrate had very correctly disregarded those when he arrived at the conclusion with regard to

the determination of the question of Appellants possession.

It was alleged by the Appellant that the learned Primary Court Judge had never considered the

documents marked as 210, 210 and 210 which also state that;

................... 124/F

, 2008 .

, 2014

.

However, it appears that the said documents 210, 210 and 210 contradict the position

taken up by the 2nd Party Intervenient Jayanath Gunathilake and the document 27 by the

Assistant Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs. Therefore, those documents cannot be considered

when determining the question of possession of the Appellant.

The aforesaid reasons clearly manifest that the learned Primary Court Judge had come to the

correct findings of fact and Law and determined the instant case in terms of Section 68 (1) of the

Act, stating that the 1st Party-Respondent-Respondent is entitled to the possession of the disputed

Page 6 of 6

portion of land and that he was dispossessed by the 2nd Party-Petitioner-Appellant within a period

of two months immediately before the date on which the information was filed.

Therefore, the learned Primary Court Judge has ordered to restore the possession of the 1st Party-

Respondent-Respondent. Hence, it is clear that the Order of the learned Primary Court Judge is

well founded, thus, the learned High Court Judge need not be interfered with the Order of the

learned Primary Court Judge.

For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Order of the learned Primary Court Judge dated

09.10.2014 and the Order made by the learned High Court Judge dated 20.10.2014 and dismiss

the appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
