The whole purpose of such commercial instruments was to provide security which was to be readily, promptly and assuredly realisable when the prescribed event occurred. The only exception to the rule is where fraud by one of the parties to the underlying contract has been established and the bank had notice of the fraud. A mere plea of fraud would in for the purpose of brining the case within this exception and which rests in the uncorroborated statements of the applicant will not suffice. In that judgement Dr. Ranaraja J further observed as follows, It is only in exceptional circumstances that Courts will interfere with the machinery of obligations assumed by the banks. They are the lifeblood of international commerce. Such obligations are regarded as collateral to underlying rights and obligations between merchants at either end of the banking chain. Courts will leave the merchants to settle their disputes under the contract by litigation.",
