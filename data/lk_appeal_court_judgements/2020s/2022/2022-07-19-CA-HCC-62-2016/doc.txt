JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General for committing the offence

as mentioned below.

On or about the 07th February 2011 in Minuwangoda the accused-

Appellant committed the murder of Alawaladewage Nalin Pushpa Kumara

which is an offence punishable under Section 296 of Penal Code.

As the Appellant opted for a non-jury trial, the trial commenced before a

judge and the prosecution had led five witnesses and marked production

P1-8 and closed the case. Although the defence had made an application to

act under section 200(1) of the Code of criminal Procedure Act No.15 of

1979, the Learned High Court Judge having satisfied that evidence

presented by the prosecution warrant a case to answer, called for the

defence and explained the rights of the accused. Having selected the right

to make a statement from the dock, the Appellant had proceeded to deny

the charge by way of his dock statement.

After considering the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the

defence, the Learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellant as

charged and sentenced him to death on 30/03/2016.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

3 | P a g e

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the

Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the

Covid 19 pandemic. At the hearing the Appellant was connected via Zoom

platform from prison.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the

Appellant.

1. The Learned High Court Judge has not properly evaluated the

evidence given by the sole eye witness PW2.

2. The identity of the Appellant has not been proved beyond reasonable

doubt.

3. Recovery under section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance has not been

proved beyond reasonable doubt.

4. The Learned High Court Judge has used the Non-Summary Inquiry

proceedings as substantive evidence when writing the Judgment and

thereby denied a fair trial to the Appellant.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

According to the eye witness PW2 Chithrangani, she had been living in a

rented house at Nilpanagoda along with her husband, his mother and her

son at the day of the incident. During that time, she was employed as a

Machine Operator at an establishment called C.C.L and her husband had

lent out a lorry on hire to the deceased. The incident had happened on the

portico of the house and only her mother, son and herself had been at

home on that day. In her evidence she had clearly mentioned both the

geographical surrounding and the structure of the house, where the

incident had taken place.

On the date of the incident around 8.35 p.m., having returned home from

work, she had been watching T.V. in her bathing attire when she heard a

person calling out sister, sister in Sinhala. She had asked her mother-in-

4 | P a g e

law to check who it was. When her mother in-law went out to check, she

had heard her scream. At the same time, she had heard a banging sound

as well. When PW2 went to the portico of the house she had seen a tall,

dark and stout person with a long knife attacking the person who had

come to make the lorry hire payment. At that time the deceased was lying

on the floor in a worshiping position and his little daughter was running

around shouting that her father is being killed. PW2 had received a clear

view of the person who attacked the deceased with a knife under the bright

light that was switched on in the portico. She had identified the Appellant

at the identification parade subsequently. She had seen the Appellant dealt

the blows on to the back of the deceaseds body, specifically, on to the back

of his neck.

When PW2 shouted at the appellant, the Appellant had frowned at her and

she had run out from rear side of the house taking her child and her

mother-in-law out of fear.

When she returned home after some time, she had seen that the deceased

was lying on the ground in a pool of blood.

Officers from the Minuwangada Police Station had conducted

investigations, arrested the accused on the following day and recovered a

knife based upon his statement under Section 27(1) of the Evidence

Ordinance.

In the first ground of appeal the appellant contends that the Learned High

Court Judge has not properly evaluated the evidence given by the sole eye

witness PW2.

The Learned High Court Judge in her judgment at page 266 of the brief

very extensively analysed the evidence of PW2 who is the sole eye witness

in this case. She had no connection whatsoever with the Appellant up to

the time of the incident. This witness had clearly witnessed the attack

carried on the deceased by the appellant using a long knife. She had

5 | P a g e

witnessed the incident from close proximity in a condition of very good

lighting. When the Appellant attacked the deceased, he was wearing only a

sarong and has been bare bodied.

She also noted the appellants physical appearance and described it to the

police when she gave her statement.

The Learned High Court Judge had observed the demeanour and the

deportment of PW2 when she gave evidence recalling the gruesome ordeal

she had encountered.

Hence, it is incorrect to say that the Learned High court Judge had not

properly evaluated the evidence given by the eye witness. The evidence

given by PW2 is not tainted with uncertainty or ambiguity and it certainly

passes the probability test.

In the case of Wickremasuriya v. Dedoleena and others 1996 [2] SLR 95

Jayasuriya J held that;

A judge, in applying the Test of Probability and Improbability relies

heavily on his knowledge of men and matters and the patterns of

conduct observed by human beings both ingenious as well as those

who are less talented and fortunate

Guided by the judgment cited above and the evidence given by PW2, I

conclude that the appellant is not successful in his first ground of appeal.

The Appellant in his second ground of appeal contends that the identity of

the Appellant has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

PW2 had moved to the house where the deceased was murdered only 5 - 6

months prior to the incident. She had admitted that she had seen the

Appellant going past this house several times. Further, she had recognised

6 | P a g e

the Appellant on the day of the incident with the bright light condition.

Also, she had described the physique of the Appellant when she made a

statement to the police.

PW2 had vehemently denied the query posted by the defence to the effect

that the Appellant was shown to her at the police station and that she was

shown his photograph before the identification parade. The witness

endorsed the fact that she had clearly identified the Appellant when he

attacked the deceased with a long knife without any contradictions or

omissions.

At the identification parade two persons had been paraded but PW2 had

properly identified the Appellant as the perpetrator of the crime. It is

pertinent to note that PW2 had told the police that she could identify the

person if she sees him again. This too proves that PW2 had correctly

identified the Appellant at the crime scene.

The Learned High Court Judge had accurately discussed the circumstances

upon which PW2 had identified the Appellant. She had very correctly

disregarded the one and only contradiction marked on the evidence given

by PW2, stating that the said contradiction is not forceful enough create a

doubt about the identity of the Appellant.

In the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa

(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292 held that,

Witnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling

discrepancies and omissions. When contradictions are

marked, the Judge should direct his attention to whether

they are material or not and the witness should be given an

opportunity of explaining the matter.

Due to aforesaid reasons this ground of appeal is also sans any merit.

7 | P a g e

In the third ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the recovery

made under section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance has not been proved

beyond reasonable doubt.

Following the arrest of the Appellant in this case, a knife was recovered

based upon his statement to the police and the same was identified by PW2

as the knife that was used to kill the deceased.

The admissibility of the recovery evidence under Section 27(1) of the

Evidence Ordinance had been discussed in several cases decided by the

Superior Courts of our country.

The Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance states that,

When any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of

information received from a person accused of any offence, in the

custody of a police officer, so much of such information, whether it

amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact

thereby discovered may be proved.

The Supreme Court in the case of Somaratne Rajapakse Others v. Hon.

Attorney General (2010) 2 Sri L.R. 113 at 115 stated that:

A vital limitation on the scope of Section 27 of the Evidence

Ordinance is that only the facts which are distinctly related to

what has been discovered would be permitted in evidence.

'There should be a clear nexus between the information given by

the accused and the subsequent discovery of a relevant fact. A

discovery made in terms of Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance

discloses that the information given was true and that the

Accused had knowledge of the existence and the whereabouts of

the actual discovery.

8 | P a g e

PW2, although she had stated that she saw the Appellant cut the deceased

with a long knife, she could not confirm the same when P1 was shown to

her. According to her she was terrified after seeing the incident which she

never expected. Hence, her position was that she saw a long knife but due

to the fear she was experiencing at that moment she could not remember

other characteristics of the knife.

The incident happened on 07/02/2011 and she gave evidence regarding

the knife on 09/02/2016, after about 05 years of the incident. As the

memory of a person fades with the lapse of time, recalling each and every

minute detail of a gruesome incident that which happened suddenly and

unexpectedly is humanely impossible.

In the case of Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat [1983] AIR SC 753

the court held that:

Ordinarily, it so happens that a witness is overtaken by events.

The witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so

often has an element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore

cannot be expected to be attuned to absorb the details.

Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the prosecution had failed to prove the

recovery evidence under Section 27(1) of Evidence Ordinance. PW8 who

had recovered the knife upon the statement of the Appellant correctly

identified the knife at the trial. In the absence of the information provided

by the Appellant, according to PW8, the knife could not have been

recovered.

Hence, this ground of appeal is also without any merits.

9 | P a g e

In the final ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the Learned High

Court Judge has used the Non-Summary Inquiry proceedings as

substantive evidence when writing the Judgment and thereby denied a fair

trial to the Appellant.

When the deceased was attacked by the Appellant with a knife, the

deceaseds 07-year-old daughter (PW4) also had come with him. When PW2

had come to the spot, the deceaseds little daughter was shouting and had

been holding the hand of the Appellant pleading him not to harm her

father. She had been named as PW4 in the indictment.

The Learned High Court Judge in her judgment had commented as to why

PW4 was not called in to give evidence in this case. The comment directly

relates to the childs welfare. Although she had referred to the report filed

in the non-Summary brief pertaining to the childs mental state, referring it

has not caused any prejudice to the Appellant as the Learned High Court

Judge had used the report only to justify the absence of PW4. This has not

affected the fair trial to the Appellant, as the Learned High Court Judge

had come to the conclusion after considering all the evidence presented by

both the prosecution and the defence. Hence this appeal ground is also

devoid of any merit.

In this case, PW2 had vividly explained how the helpless deceased was

positioned when he was brutally attacked. When PW2 looked at the

deceased at the time of the assault, he was in a worshiping position, but

this was not considered by the Appellant. Further, this gruesome murder

had been evidenced by the deceaseds daughter.

When the evidence presented against the Appellant is considered, I

conclude that the prosecution had succeeded in adducing highly

incriminating evidence against the Appellant and thereby established the

charge beyond reasonable doubt.

10 | P a g e

As such, I conclude, that this is not an appropriate case in which to

interfere with the findings of the Learned High Court Judge of Negombo

dated 30/03/2016. Hence, I dismiss the Appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court

of Negombo along with the original case record.
