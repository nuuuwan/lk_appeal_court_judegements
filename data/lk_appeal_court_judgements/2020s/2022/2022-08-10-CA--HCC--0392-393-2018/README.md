JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) were indicted in the High Court of Batticaloa under Section 296

of the Penal Code for committing the murder of Mylvaganam Vadivel on or

about 09th October 2005.

When the case was called on 12/07/2007 in the High Court of Batticaloa,

both the Appellants were present and the indictment was served on them.

When this case was called again on 10/09/2007 the 2nd Appellant had

absconded and an inquiry was held under section 241 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and the case was fixed for trial in

absentia of the 2nd Appellant. A non-jury trial was commenced on

03/09/2009 and the prosecution closed their case on 29/04/2014 and the

learned High Court Judge had called for the defence. On 21/07/2014 the

1st Appellant had made a dock statement and closed his case.

On 15/12/2014 the 2nd Appellant was produced before the High Court of

Batticaloa and the learned High Court Judge after considering the

submissions of both parties had vacated the order made on 15/06/2009

and allowed the 2nd Appellant to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses

3 | P a g e

who had already given evidence in the trial. After electing a non-jury trial,

the Counsel for the 2nd Appellant had cross examined the witnesses already

called by the prosecution. When the defence was called, the 2nd Appellant

also made a dock statement and closed the case.

After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High

Court Judge had convicted the Appellants under Section 296 of Penal Code

and sentenced them to death on 30/10/2018.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants have given consent for this matter to be argued in their absence

due to the Covid 19 pandemic restrictions. Also, at the time of argument

the Appellants were connected via Zoom from prison.

Background of the Case

In this case PW1 and PW2 who are the wife and the son of the deceased

respectively, were considered as eye witnesses to the incident.

According to PW1, on the day of the incident the deceased had returned

home at about 6.00 p.m. and had left to pluck coconuts. After having a

bath and before having dinner, he had walked towards the gate to lock it

around 9.00 p.m. As the dogs started barking unusually, PW1 had asked

PW2 to check outside. However, both had stepped out of the house to

check what issue was and had witnessed two persons hiding behind a

mound of earth piled near the garage and the parked three-wheeler. They

had identified the Appellants as the brothers of PW1 and the uncles of

PW2. According to PW1, the 1st Appellant had dealt a blow with a club and

the 2nd Appellant had stabbed the deceased with a knife. As a result, the

deceased had fallen down. After the stabbing both appellants had escaped

on a bicycle.

4 | P a g e

The PW2 also narrated the same course of events as her mother PW1.

PW3 who had arrived at the scene upon hearing the cries of PW1 had taken

the deceased who had been stabbed in the chest and was bleeding to

Kalawanchikudy hospital in his three-wheeler. But the deceased had

passed away upon admission.

PW4, the Judicial Medical Officer had conducted the post-mortem

examination and made note of two injuries on the deceaseds body. The

stab injury which was on the left chest of the deceased caused by the knife

was observed to be the fatal injury. As per the evidence of PW4, the injury

which was found on the left chin had been caused with a blunt weapon and

since the jaw bone had been fractured that too was identified as a grievous

injury.

As the evidence presented by the prosecution warranted the presence of a

case to be answered by the Appellants, the learned Trial Judge had had

called for the defence and both Appellants had made statements from the

dock. In their dock statements both had denied any involvement in

committing the murder of their brother-in-law.

The grounds of appeal advanced by the Appellants are as follows.

1. Section 03 of the Evidence Ordinance is grossly violated

rendering the conviction flawed.

2. The learned Trial Judge has totally failed to narrate the dock

statements of the Appellants thereby causing serious prejudice to

the Appellants and occasioned in a deprivation of a fair trial.

5 | P a g e

3. The Judgment is in total violation of Section 283 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979. Hence the application of

the proviso is wholly inexplicable.

Under the 1st ground of appeal, the Counsel for the Appellant contends that

Section 03 of the Evidence Ordinance is grossly violated by the learned

High Court Judge rendering the conviction flawed.

E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy in Volume I of The Law of Evidence at

page 4 states:

The question, therefore, arises, what degree of probability is

essential to belief? In England, the verdict of the jury implies

that the necessary degree of probability has been attained. In

Sri Lanka, except in some criminal cases, this responsibility is

also placed on the judge. He must decide according to the

interpretation in Section 03 of the Evidence Ordinance,

whether:

1) A fact has been proved: this happens when, after

considering the matters before it, the court either believes it to

exist or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man

ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act

upon the supposition that it exists; or

2) A fact has been disproved: here, the court, again after

consideration of the matters before it, either believes that the

fact does not exist, or considers its non-existence, act upon the

supposition that it does not exist: or

6 | P a g e

3) A fact has not been proved: this means that it has

neither been proved nor disproved.

In discharging this responsibility, the judge must use good

sense, good judgment, insight and experience.

In this case the learned High Court Judge has adequately considered the

incident in its correct perspective. He had firmly relied on the evidence of

the eye witnesses.

In this case PW1 and PW2 had clearly witnessed the incident and identified

both the Appellants as they are very close relations of PW1. Fabrication of

evidence against the Appellants had been disregarded by the learned High

Court Judge in his judgment. Hence, it is incorrect to say that section 03 of

the Evidence Ordinance had been grossly violated by the learned High

court Judge. Hence, this ground of appeal has no merit.

In the second ground of appeal the Counsel for the Appellants argued that

the learned Trial Judge has completely failed to at the least narrate the

dock statements of the Appellants thereby causing serious prejudice to the

Appellants thereby occasioning a deprivation of a fair trial for the

Appellants.

The Appellants have the right to a fair trial to determine whether they are

innocent or guilty which is an internationally recognised human right. Fair

trials help establish the truth and are vital for everyone involved in a case.

They are a cornerstone of democracy, helping to ensure the development of

fair and just societies, and limiting of abuse perpetrated by state

authorities.

The profound duty of the trial court is to consider the evidence placed by

the prosecution and the defence on equal footings to arrive at its finding.

7 | P a g e

In R v. Hepworth 1928 (AD) 265, at 277, Curlewis JA stated:

A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim

the benefit of any omission or mistake made by the other side,

and a Judge's position in a criminal trial is not merely that of an

umpire to see that the rules of the game are applied by both

sides. A Judge is an administrator of justice, not merely a figure-

head, he has not only to direct and control the proceedings

according to recognised rules of procedure but to see that justice

is done.

In the present case upon perusal of the judgment delivered by the trial

Judge it is manifestly clear that the learned High Court Judge had

completely disregarded the dock statements of the Appellants and thereby

had failed to provide a fair trial for them. The importance of considering the

dock statement had been discussed in several judgments by the Superior

Courts. However, its evidentiary value is less than the evidence given from

the witness box by an accused.

In Queen v. Buddharakkitha Thero 63 NLR 433 the court held that:

The right of an accused person to make an unsworn statement

from the dock is recognised in our law (King v. Vellayan[10

(1918) 20 N. L. R. 251-at 266.].) That right would be of no value

unless such a statement is treated as evidence on behalf of the

accused subject however to the infirmity which attaches to

statements that are unsworn and have not been tested by cross-

examination.

8 | P a g e

In Queen v. Kularatne 71 NLR 529 the court held that:

We are in respectful agreement and are of the view that such a

statement must be looked upon as evidence subject to the

infirmity that the accused had deliberately refrained from giving

sworn testimony, and the jury must be so informed. But the jury

must also be directed that;

a) If they believe the unsworn statement, it must be acted

upon.

b) If it raised a reasonable doubt in their minds about the

case for the prosecution, the defense must succeed,

c) That it should not be used against another accused.

As the learned High Court Judge had not considered the dock statements

of the Appellant as evidence, this ground of appeal has merit.

In the final ground of appeal, the learned Counsel for the Appellants

contends that the judgment is in total violation of Section 283 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979. Hence application of the proviso

is wholly inexplicable.

In Chandrasena and Others v. Munaweera 1998 (3) SLR 94 the court held

that:

The mere outline of the prosecution and defence without

reasons being given for the decision is an insufficient discharge

of duty cast upon a judge by the provisions of S.306(1)..

In Karunadasa v. OIC Police Station, Nittambuwa (1987) 1 SLR 155 the

court held that:

Merely reciting the facts and giving no reasons for the

judgment is insufficient. The Magistrate must give reasons for

his conclusions and scrutinize the evidence led on behalf of the

9 | P a g e

accused. Failure to give reasons can occasion a failure of justice.

An outline of the facts embellished with phrases like "I accept

the evidence of the prosecution", 'I disbelieve the defence" is

insufficient to discharge the duty cast on the prosecution.

Section 283 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act makes it

imperative to give reasons in the judgment. The Magistrate has

said "the evidence of the witness called by the accused does not

in any manner help the defence. Therefore, I accept the evidence

adduced on behalf of the prosecution'. This shows that the

Magistrate has given his decision very largely on the weakness

of the defence rather than on the strength of the prosecution. It is

an imperative requirement that the prosecution must be

convincing no matter how weak the defence is before the court

can convict. The weakness of the defence must not be allowed to

bolster up a weak case for the prosecution. The evidence must

establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence. His

innocence is presumed by the law and his guilt must be

established beyond reasonable doubt.

In CA 34-35/2005 decided on 03/04/2007 Sisira De Abrew,J, held that:

In this case the Learned Trial Judge has merely narrated the

evidence of the prosecution witnesses without giving adequate

reasons for the conclusion and for the acceptance of the

evidence of the prosecution witnesses. In our view, a judgment

devoid of adequate reasons for the conclusion reached and a

mere reproduction of evidence of witnesses is not a judgment in

the eyes of the law. We find that the judgment of the Learned

trial judge in this case is no judgment and would amount to

nullity.

10 | P a g e

Upon the perusal of the judgment, it becomes evident that the learned trial

Judge had only narrated the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses.

The learned High Court Judge had failed to analyze and evaluate the

evidence in his judgment. Therefore, the judgment cannot be considered as

a proper judgment. In the absence of a proper judgment delivered by the

Trial Courts the only conclusion that could be reached by an Appellate

Court is to declare the judgment pronounced by the High Court a nullity.

When the Appellate Court concludes that the judgment pronounced in the

High Court trial is a nullity, application under Section 436 of Code of

criminal Procedure Code Act No. 15 of 1979 and proviso to under the

Article 138 of the Constitution cannot be availed.

W. L. R. Silva,J. in CA/34-35/2005 (Supra) had correctly held that:

One cannot expect the Court of Appeal to re-write the judgment

when the judgment pronounced by the Learned High court

Judge is a nullity.

Hence this ground also has merit.

As the 2nd and 3rd Appeal grounds have merit, it is certainly sufficient to

disturb the outcome of the trial. Therefore, I set aside the conviction and

the sentence imposed on the Appellants.

The Appellants had not been successful under the first ground of appeal.

Hence, the evidence presented by the prosecution should be considered by

the learned High court Judge. Therefore, I conclude that this is an

appropriate case to be sent for a re-trial even though the incident happened

on 09/10/2005.

11 | P a g e

The learned High Court Judge is hereby directed to conduct a re-trial

expeditiously.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court

of Batticaloa along with the original case record.
