Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence of him by the

learned High Court Judge of Galle, where he was sentenced to death.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Galle for causing the death

of one Prabath Priyankara on 14th of April 2004, an offence punishable in

terms of section 296 of the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, the learned High Court Judge of Galle found the

appellant guilty as charged, and sentenced him accordingly.

At the hearing of the appeal the learned Counsel for the appellant pursued only

one ground of appeal, that the learned trial judge who pronounced the

judgment has failed to formally adopt the evidence led before his predecessor

as required in terms of section 48 of the Judicature Act, hence, the said non-

compliance is an illegality warranting a trial de novo.

In her submissions before this Court the learned Counsel relied on the

judgments of Singharam Thiyagarajah Vs. The Attorney General C.A.-

Page 3 of 8

216/2010 decided on 10-10-2014 and Ratnayake Vs. A.G. (2004) 1 SLR

390, which are judgments pronounced previously by this Court.

In both the above mentioned judgments their lordships of the Court of Appeal

held that failure to formally adopt the proceedings led before the predecessor

by the trial judge amounts to a violation of a fundamental procedural

requirement which justifies a re-trial in the interest of justice.

However, with all due respect to their lordships views on the relevant question

of law, I wish to disagree.

Section 48 of the Judicature Act No-02 of 1978 was repealed and substituted

by the Judicature (Amendment) Act No 27 of 1999.

The section 48 of the Judicature Act as amended, reads as follows;

Section 48- In the case of death, sickness, resignation, removal from office,

absence from Sri Lanka, or other disability of any judge before whom any

action, prosecution, proceeding or matter, whether on any inquiry

preliminary to committal for trial or otherwise, has been instituted or is

pending such action, prosecution, proceeding, matter may be continued

before the successor of such judge who shall have power to act on the

evidence already recorded by his predecessor, or partly recorded by his

predecessor and partly recorded by him or, if he thinks fit to re-summon

the witness and commence the proceedings afresh:

Provided that where any criminal prosecution, proceeding or matter (except

on an inquiry preliminary to committal for trial) is continued before the

successor of any such judge, the accused may demand that the witness

may re-summoned and reheard. (The emphasis is mine)

The official text of the proviso of section 48 as amended by Amendment

Act No 27 of 1999 which is the Sinhala text, reads as follows:

The intention of the legislature in repealing and substituting of the original

proviso of the Judicature Act by the Amendment was considered by Abdul

Salam,J. (as he was then) in the case of Kaluwahum Purage Somapala Vs.

The Commission to Investigate Bribery and Corruption CA(PHC)APN37/09

decided on 03-02-2010.

Comparing the previous proviso that existed before the amendment and the

new proviso, he commented on the reasons behind the amendment in the

following manner.

It is common knowledge that the proviso to section 48 worked

tremendous hardship to the parties both in criminal and civil matters

whenever a party to a case (prosecutor, accused, plaintiff,

defendant, intervenient, added party or any other party) improperly

or unreasonably invoked the proviso. This has resulted in the

Judicial Service Commission having to reappoint judges to avoid

trials being heard de novo. Being conscious of the unsatisfactory

state which resulted in judges at times having to travel long

distances to hear partly heard cases at the expense of severe

hardship being caused to the litigants at their permanent stations,

the legislature repealed the proviso to section 48 and substituted

thereof,

Page 5 of 8

Considering the literal meaning of the word demand as stated in the amended

proviso and the Sinhala word used, which is the official text, it was stated by

him that;

Even in the event of a demand being made by the accused as

contemplated by the proviso, yet the court is not bound to comply

with such a demand as if it is mandatory. The Oxford Dictionary

meaning assigned to the word demand is an urgent or peremptory

or authoritative request and nothing more. Quite interestingly the

authoritative version of the Act No 27 of 1999 being Sinhala in

introducing the new proviso uses the expression

as corresponding to the word the

accused may demand. This provides a firm proof that the new

proviso is not only has done away with the requirement of having to

commence proceedings afresh but even the request () to recall

a witness is also placed within the exclusive jurisdiction of the

judge.

As considered by Abdul Salam, J. in the above judgment, I would also like to

reproduce the relevant part of the judgment by his lordship W.L.R. Silva, J. in

the case of Jeevan Thiyagaraja Vs. A.T. Shyama Fernando in C.A. (PHC)

APN 26/2008, which I find relevant.

In the amended proviso to section 48 there is no duty, whether

directory or mandatory cast on the judge, and the right to demand is

only given to the accused. In the old provision it was mandatory for

the court to order a trial de novo but there is a deliberate omission of

such mandatory provision in the new proviso to section 48. Even

under the old provision one could interpret the word shall to mean

may and conclude that it was only directory and not mandatory.

(Vide Ramalingam Vs. Thanagaraja (1982) 2 SLR at 693). The

Page 6 of 8

omission here cannot be regarded as unintentional omission

because it is clear what the mischief is, the legislature intended to

remedy. The mischief is the laws delay as a result of the judges

being compelled to order trials de novo whenever either party to an

action desired a fresh trial.

It is clear from the appeal under review that except for the evidence of PW-01,

the rest of the evidence had been led before the learned High Court Judge who

pronounced the judgment. When the matter was mentioned before him for

further hearing of evidence on 24-12-2012, the appellant has been represented

by the same Counsel who appeared for him previously. The case record bear

testimony that no application has been made before the Court to recall the PW-

01 who was the only witness who has given evidence before the predecessor of

the learned High Court Judge. Which has resulted in the calling of the rest of

the witnesses.

The argument of the learned Counsel for the appellant is that the learned High

Court Judge has failed to adopt the evidence. However, I find no provision in

that regard in section 48 of the judicature Act as the very purpose of the

section is to provide for the continuation of a trial to avoid undue delay under

given circumstances.

It was held in the case of Herath Mudiyanselage Ariyratne Vs. Republic of

Sri Lanka (CA 307/2006 decided on 17-07-2013 that a transfer of a judge to

another station covers by the words other disability as stated in section 48 of

the Judicature Act, hence the succeeding judge has no disability to continue

with a trial.

As discussed earlier, the main part of section 48 provides for a succeeding

judge to re-summon a witness and commence the proceedings afresh if the

judge thinks fit, which is applicable to either civil or criminal matters at the

discretion of the judge.

Page 7 of 8

In the case under consideration, it is clear from the proceedings that the

succeeding High Court Judge has decided to continue with the case by calling

the remaining witnesses as formally adopting the evidence previously recorded

was not a matter that needed the attention of the Learned High Court Judge,

as there was no such requirement and the provision is for the continuation of

the trial.

As provided in the proviso of section 48 of the Judicature Act, as amended,

which is applicable only for criminal prosecutions, if any demand was made to

re-summon PW-01 with acceptable reasoning, the learned trial judge could

have considered the request and an appropriate order would have been made

at his discretion. I find that no such application has been made.

I am of the view that without making use of the available provision before the

correct forum, which amounts to a waiver of such right, the appellant is now

precluded from arguing at the appeal stage that the learned succeeding High

Court Judge failed to adopt the previous proceedings and hence, the matter

should be sent for a trial de novo.

I find that this as an argument which have the effect of reviving the section 48

of the Judicature Act to the level before it was amended by the amendment Act

No 27 of 1999, if allowed. This was not the intention of the legislature in

bringing in the amendment to the Act, as discussed before.

In the case of Union of India Vs. Namit Sharma AIR 2014 SC 122, (2013) 10

SCC 359, quoting Union of India Vs. Dekoi Nandan Aggrawal, AIR 1992 SC

96, (1992) SCC (L&S)248 the Supreme Court of India reiterated that;

It is not the duty of the Court either to enlarge the scope of the legislation

or the intention of the legislature when the language of the provision is

plain and unambiguous. The court cannot rewrite, recast or reframe the

legislation for the very good reason that it has no power to legislate. The

power to legislate has not been conferred on the court. The court cannot

Page 8 of 8

add words to a statute or read words into it which are not there. Assuming

there is a defect or an omission in the words used by the legislature the

court could not go into its aid to correct or makeup the deficiency. courts

shall decide what the law is and not what it should be. court of course

adopts a construction which will carry out the obvious intention of the

legislature, but could not legislate itself. But to invoke judicial activism to

set at naught legislative judgment is subversive of the Constitutional

harmony and comity of instrumentalities.

(N. S. Bindra on Interpretation of Statutes- 12th Edition at page 38)

For the given reasons, I find that although it has been the long-standing

practice of our judges to formally adopt the evidence led before their

predecessors, it is not a mandatory requirement.

The appeal therefore is dismissed, as the ground of appeal perused is devoid of

any merit.

The conviction and the sentence affirmed.
