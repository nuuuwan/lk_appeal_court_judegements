The petitioner has filed four applications in appeal namely PHC 194/15,

PHC 197/15, PHC 201/15 and PHC 202/15 impugning four different

orders delivered by the High Court of Colombo. Petitioner has agreed to be

bound by a single judgment for all four applications.

All four impugned orders were delivered on 18.11.2015 by the High Court

of Colombo wherein the learned High Court Judge dismissed the revision

applications filed by the petitioner without issuing notices to the

respondent. Three out of the four dismissals were occasioned by undue

delay of 9 years and the fourth dismissal was due to a delay of 5 years.

The four revisions thus filed pertains to the sentencing orders delivered by

the Magistrate Court of Gangodawila and Kaduwela on different dates:

1. Magistrate Court of Gangodawila Case No 65158: sentenced on

01.08.2007 (PHC 194/2015)

2. Magistrate Court of Gangodawila Case No 65559, sentenced on

10.06.2010 (PHC 225/2015)

3. Magistrate Court of Gangodawila Case No 65557, sentence

31.10.2007 (PHC 202/2015)

4. Magistrate Court of Kaduwela Case No 56681, sentenced on

12.07.2007 (PHC 201/2015)

In each of the impugned orders, the learned High Court Judge states that

sentences in different cases cannot be combined and that law requires that

sentences in different cases should run separately.

The facts of each of the four applications are similar. The petitioner has

pleaded guilty for charges under Section 443 and Section 369 of the Penal

Code. The petitioner is a 62-year-old who has been sentenced for a string

of house breaking at night and theft. He has been incarcerated since 2006

CA-PHC-201-2015 Page 4 of 6 29/03/2022 IJ-13-D-22

and will continue to serve his sentence till 2041. The counsel for the

petitioner submitted that considering the totality of the circumstances the

operation of the four impugned sentences be suspended. The counsel for

the petitioner did not present any mitigatory facts other than the age of

the petitioner and the prospect of continued incarceration for the next two

decades. The counsel for the respondent submitted that the petitioner is a

habitual offender. It was the respondents contention that the Court of

Appeal sitting in appellate jurisdiction is not a court of mercy and that in

the absence of valid legal reasoning; all four applications filed by the

petitioner should be dismissed.

The general principle regarding sentences is that the sentence takes effect

from the time it is pronounced. However, Section 300 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 (hereinafter the CPC) is an

exception to this general principle. Section 300 of the CPC states that when

a person undergoing imprisonment is sentenced to imprisonment such

imprisonment shall commence at the expiration of the imprisonment to

which he has been previously sentenced. Section 300 of the CPC was

discussed in length in Weerawarnakula v The Republic of Sri Lanka

(2002) 3 SLR 213. The relevant portions of the judgment are reproduced

below:

It [section 300] applies to a situation where a person actually

undergoing imprisonment is in some other case again sentenced to

imprisonment. According to the section the latter imprisonment shall

commence to operate at the expiration of the imprisonment to which

he has been previously sentenced. This is an exception to the general

rule that a sentence begins to operate from the time it is pronounced.

Section 300 is couched in imperative terms and in view of the wording

of the section no court has the power or discretion to order that a

sentence of imprisonment ordered by it shall run concurrently with a

sentence of imprisonment ordered in a previous case which the

accused is serving when he is sentenced in the 2nd case.

CA-PHC-201-2015 Page 5 of 6 29/03/2022 IJ-13-D-22

In Godagama v Mathea (1908) 4 ACR VII Wood Renton, J. stressing

the imperative nature of section 321 of the Criminal Procedure Code

of 1898 (which was identical with present section 300 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act) said that "it is not competent for a Magistrate

to order that a sentence passed on an offender who is already

sentenced for another offence shall run concurrently with the

previous sentence." ( @ page 217)

It is clear from the facts of the instant applications that the petitioner has

landed himself in very unfortunate circumstances. Due to the operation of

Section 300 of the CPC, the combined effect of all the convictions and

sentencing of the petitioner is that he will be incarcerated till 2041. The

main legal issue to be dealt with by this Court pertains to whether or not

the Court of Appeal sitting in revision, is empowered to grant any relief to

the petitioner based on the circumstances he has placed himself in. In

Weerawarnakula v The Republic of Sri Lanka (supra) the Court of Appeal

thought it a fit case to exercise its powers under Section 336 of the CPC to

substitute lesser sentences in place of the sentences imposed by the

learned High Court Judge in several independent cases, where heavy

emphasis was laid on the peculiar circumstances of that case. It was an

instance where three separate indictments were forwarded against the

accused-appellant where the subject matter of all three indictments was a

single transaction which continued over two years (emphasis added) where

Section 165 (2) of the CPC was in operation. The Court of Appeal held:

The accused-appellant was sentenced in May 2000, nearly fifteen

years after the 1st offence. If not for the provisions of section 165 (2)

the accused-appellant could have been charged in one case for all

offences committed by him in one transaction and in the event of a

conviction the accused-appellant would have been entitled to

concurrent sentences under section 16 of the Criminal Procedure

Code. At the time of the investigation the accused-appellant had been

in remand from April 1987 to September 1988, nearly 18 months.

CA-PHC-201-2015 Page 6 of 6 29/03/2022 IJ-13-D-22

In 1987 the accused-appellant was 47 years old and presently he is

well over 60. The maximum periods of imprisonment prescribed

under sections 392 and 467 are 10 and 7 years, respectively. In

the result the total period of imprisonment in respect of case Nos.

997/93 and 998/93 is reduced from 13 years to 6 years rigorous

imprisonment. In view of this the appeal against sentence is partly

allowed. (Pages 221- 222)

However, the facts emanating from the instant applications are vastly

different. Petitioner is a habitual offender. He has close to 29 convictions.

There is no discretion available to this Court to provide relief based on the

combined effect of a multiplicity of convictions. Especially given that the

offences were not committed in the course of a single transaction and that

the convictions and sentences were given by different Courts on different

occasions.

Appeals dismissed.
