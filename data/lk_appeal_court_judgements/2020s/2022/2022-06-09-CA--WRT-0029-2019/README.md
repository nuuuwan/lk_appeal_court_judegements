S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

By this Writ Application, the Petitioner seeks, inter alia, a writ of Mandamus directing

the 1st 4th Respondents to issue a Permit/Grant under the Land Development

Ordinance, No. 19 of 1935 (as amended) (hereinafter referred to as the Ordinance) to

the Petitioner for the land depicted as lot 109 of the Supplement 6 of the Final Village

Plan No. 157 which is alienated by her under the Permit marked P-3 and a writ of

prohibition prohibiting the 1st 4th Respondents from issuing a Permit/Grant to the 5th

Respondent for the said land. The Petitioner is the lawfully nominated successor by her

father Waththe Vidanalage Simon alias B.P. Simon to the above-mentioned land which

is in extent of 2 Acres. This land is situated within Ellekoona Grama Niladhari Division

in the Medagama Divisional Secretariat Division and depicted as Lot 18 in the Final

Village Plan No.157. The father of the Petitioner was issued with the Permit marked as

P-3 to the said land and he nominated the Petitioner as his successor to the land. The

father had died in 1975 and thereafter, the Petitioner, her mother, Nonnehamy and the

siblings of the Petitioner continued to live on the land. The Petitioner, after her marriage

3

in the year 1980, constructed a house on the land and lived in it. In the year 1992, the

Petitioners mother, together with the 5th Respondent, W.V. Podimahaththya who is the

brother of the Petitioner ejected the Petitioner and her family from the land, claiming

that the mother has the life interest of the father. In pursuant to the complaints made by

the Petitioner to the Divisional Secretary of Medagama (the 1st Respondent) inquiry

was held regarding the dispute and the mother was permitted to live on the land until

her death and her name was inserted to the P-3 as a life interest holder. Later in 1997,

a Grant was issued to the mother for her life-interest (as per P-7). The mother died in

2017, but the 5th Respondent did not vacate the land and continued to be in the forcible

possession. After the death of the mother even though, the Petitioner made requests

from the 1st 4th Respondents to take necessary steps to issue a Permit/Grant for the

land to her, they failed to take any step.

The position of the 5th Respondent is that the Petitioner failed to enter into the

possession of the land within six months period from the death of the mother and

therefore, in terms of the section 68(2) of the Ordinance she is not entitled to succeed

to the land.

Section 68(2) provides thus;

A nominated successor fails to succeed to the land held on a permit by a permit-holder

who at the time of his or her death was paying an annual sum by virtue of the provisions

of subsection (3) of section 19A or to the holding of an owner if he refuses to succeed

to that land or holding, or, if the nominated successor does not enter into possession of

that land or holding within a period of six months reckoned-

(i) where such permit-holder or owner dies without leaving behind his or her

spouse, from the date of the death of such permit-holder or owner; or

(ii) where such permit-holder or owner dies without leaving behind his or her

spouse, from the date of the failure of such spouse to succeed, such date being reckoned

4

according to the provisions of paragraph (b) of subsection (1), or of the death of such

spouse as the case may be.

The Petitioner admits that she was dispossessed by her mother and the 5th Respondent

from the land. Thereafter, in 1997, a Grant has been issued to the mother for her life

interest. Admittedly the mother died on 18.12.2017 (death certificate is marked as P-

25). The Petitioner made a formal request on 08.01.2018 to the 1st Respondent in

prescribed Form (marked as P-23) used at the Office of the 1st Respondent to succeed

to the land and the 1st 4th Respondents admit in their statement of objections that the

letter marked as P-23 was received by the 1st Respondent. After the death of the mother,

the Petitioner made attempts to recover the possession of the land from the 5th

Respondent, but failed those attempts. Upon the failure of those attempts the Petitioner

made a complaint to the Medagama Police Station and by the letter dated 14.03.2018,

the OIC of the Police referred the dispute to the 1st Respondent to take suitable steps.

The 1st 4th Respondents admit that Medagama Police referred the matter to the 1st

Respondent. The Petitioner wrote to the District Secretary of Monaragala (the 2nd

Respondent) about the dispute and the 2nd Respondent by letter dated 02.04.2018

(marked as P-28) referred the matter to the 1st Respondent to inquire into to. By the

letter dated 05.07.2018 (marked as P-29) the 1st Respondent summoned the parties for

an inquiry. The letters marked as P-24 and P-29 were admitted by the 1st 4th

Respondents. When perusing the documents marked as P-25 to P-28 it is clear that the

Petitioner has taken all possible steps to succeed to the land, but failed to enter into the

possession of the land due to the resistance of the 5th Respondent. Therefore, the Court

cannot accept the position of the 5th Respondent that the Petitioner has failed to succeed

to the land within a period of 6 months from the date of the death of the mother,

Nonnehamy. Under the above stated circumstances, the Court decided to issue a writ

of Mandamus directing the 1st 4th Respondents to issue a Permit/Grant under the

Ordinance to the Petitioner to the land in dispute, and a writ of Prohibition probating

the 1st 4th Respondents from issuing a Permit/Grant to the 5th Respondent for the said

5

land. The 5th Respondent is ordered to pay Rs:75,000/= to the Petitioner as costs of this

Application.
