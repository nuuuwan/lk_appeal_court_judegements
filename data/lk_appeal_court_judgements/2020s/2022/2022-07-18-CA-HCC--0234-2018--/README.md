JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam. J,

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted for committing the murder of Gamagedera

Yasomenike on 15/04/2009 which is an offence punishable under Section

296 of the Penal Code.

After a non-jury trial, the Learned High Court Judge has found the

Appellant guilty of the charge and had sentenced him to death on

10/05/2018.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the

Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the

Covid- 19 pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellant was

connected via zoom platform from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant four Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. The Learned High Court Judge has cast an additional burden of

proof on the Appellant thereby denying him a fair trial.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has erroneously rejected the defence

evidence.

3. Evidence led at the trial warrants the consideration of the exception

of cumulative provocation.

Background of the Case

According to PW1, the Appellant was his brother-in-law, who had been

married to his elder sister. As their married life has become miserable, his

sister had estranged the Appellant and was living with her parents in their

house. As such, the Appellant had lived with his mother. On the day of the

incident, which was the day following the day of the Sinhala and Tamil New

Year, around 6.00 a.m. the deceased had gone to the rear side of her house

for excretion purposes, as they did not have properly built washroom

facilities. PW1 had gone with the deceased and had stood near the well. The

reason why he accompanied the deceased was because the Appellant had

extended death threats to the deceaseds family on previous occasions.

When he was standing near the well, the Appellant had arrived with a gun

and the deceased had come out to the well area. At that point the deceased

had called out to her husband who had hurried to the spot. When the

Appellant had inquired about the whereabouts of his wife from the

deceased, the deceased had told him that his wife was not at home.

At that time the deceaseds husband too had arrived at the scene and had

had a verbal exchange with the Appellant. When the Appellant had made a

death threat to the deceased, she had challenged him to carry out what he

says as the Appellant had issued death threats to the deceased on several

previous occasions. When the deceased had challenged the Appellant, he

had opened fire at the deceased. Although the deceased was taken to the

Dambulla Hospital, she had been pronounced dead on admission.

On the previous night, i.e., 14/04/2009 the Appellant had come to the

deceaseds house armed with a knife and inquired about his wife from the

deceased. As the deceased intimated to him that his wife was not at home,

the Appellant had issued death threats to the deceased.

4 | P a g e

According to medical evidence the firing had taken place from a distance of

about one meter and the deceased had suffered three entry wounds and

three exit wounds.

After the closure of the prosecution case, the defence was called and the

Appellant had opted to give evidence from the witness box.

In his evidence the Appellant took up the position that he did not entertain

any murderous intention but the gun had gone off accidently when he had

grappled with the deceaseds husband for the gun.

Consideration of the appeal grounds forwarded by the Appellant

The Appellant in his first ground of appeal contends that the Learned High

Court Judge has cast an additional burden of proof on the Appellant

thereby denying him a fair trial.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant indicated three instances in the

judgment of the Trial Judge where the Appellant was not awarded a fair

trial due to the shifting of the burden to the Appellant consequently,

reversing the presumption of innocence.

The three instances mentioned in the written submission filed on behalf of

the Appellant are re-produced below as follows:

At line 4 from the top of page 648 and similarly at page 656 the

learned trial Judge had observed that the defence had failed to call

any witnesses and had failed to prove his defence by failing to prove

the necessity to leave his house with a gun to chase away wild

Elephants.

Furthermore, when evaluating the defence evidence the learned trial

Judge had once again cast adverse remarks against the Appellant

for his failure to call the relevant witness which is apparent at line 4

from the top on page 661 and line 3 from the bottom on page 661.

5 | P a g e

It is respectfully submitted that the Learned Trial Judge had once

again noted that the Appellant had failed to prove that wild

Elephants had encroached thereby completely misdirecting himself

in law relating to the burden of proof lying on the Appellant at the

9th line from the bottom on page 663.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant had argued highlighting the above

portions of the judgment in support of the first ground of appeal.

The concept of Fair Trial has been embodied in the Constitution of Sri

Lanka as a Fundamental Right. This concept of a fair trial has been

considered in the following landmark judgments in our jurisdiction.

Viraj v. AG SC Appeal No.24/2008 and Wijepala v. AG [2001] 1 SLR 46.

Considering the evidence given by the Appellant, even though he had taken

up several differing positions, those positions had not been adequately put

to the relevant witnesses during cross examination. The above-mentioned

portions of the judgment are comments or remarks for the better

presentation of the defence case. Hence, these comments cannot be

considered as casting an additional burden of proof on the Appellant.

In King v. Attygalle (VI C.L.W. 41) at page 43 the court held that:

That even though the jury had been misdirected on the law, there

were circumstances pointing irresistibly to the guilt of the accused

quite independently of this direction.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge had accurately considered this

case keeping with the legally recognised standard of proof requirements of

a criminal trial. As the evidence presented by the prosecution is strong and

clear, the only definitive inference that the court could arrive at is the guilt

of the Appellant. Hence, after careful consideration of the judgment, it is

evident that the comments or remarks which had been highlighted in this

6 | P a g e

ground of appeal has not been prejudiced the Appellants rights in this

case. Due to afore-said reasons this ground has no merit.

In the second ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the learned

High Court Judge has erroneously rejected the defence evidence.

The learned High Court Judge had called for the defence after evaluating

the evidence presented by the prosecution. The Appellant had given

evidence and had taken up the defence of accidental firing when according

to him, he grappled with the deceaseds husband and the gun went off. As

this is a general exception, the Appellant should have proved the same on a

standard of balance of probability under Section 105 of the Evidence

Ordinance. Further this position was never suggested to PW1, who is an

eye witness in this case.

The Appellant having put forth circumstances coming within his

knowledge, adducing evidence to support his claim is his duty which he

had failed to do so in this case. Hence, rejection of the defence is not

erroneous as the Learned High Court Judge has sufficiently considered the

evidence presented by both parties to come to the correct decision.

Therefore, this ground of appeal is also without merit.

In the third ground of appeal the Appellant argues that the evidence led at

the trial warrants the consideration of the exception of cumulative

provocation.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant argues that the case against the

Appellant should have been considered under the plea of cumulative

provocation and the Appellant should have been awarded the benefit under

the said exception. She had emphasised the following items of evidence to

support her argument in this regard.

As the Appellants wife was estranged from him and was living with her

daughter in her parental house, all his efforts to reunite with his family

was prevented by his father-in-law. At one occasion he was severally beaten

7 | P a g e

by his father-in-law for which he had been hospitalised with serious

injuries. At the time of the incident when he inquired about her estranged

wife from the deceased she had not divulged her daughters whereabouts.

Further, although he had taken several phone calls to his wife they were

not answered. Further, he had been prevented from meeting her daughter

during the festival day.

Due to continuous quarrels and unbearable pain inflicted through physical

abuse, the Appellants estranged wife had decided to separate from him

and live with her parents instead. The Appellant had been never been

deprived of seeing his daughter.

Cumulative Provocation is an extension to the exception 1 of Section 294 of

the Penal Code which states:

Culpable Homicide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived of

the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes

the death of the person who gave the provocation, or causes the

death of any other person by mistake or accident

Cumulative Provocation as a special exception to a murder charge has been

discussed in several judgments in our courts.

In Premlal v Attorney General [2000] 2 SLR 403 Kulatilaka J held that:

Until the judgment of Chief Justice H. N. G. Fernando in

Samithamby vs. Queen (1) (de Kretser, J. - dissenting) our

Courts followed a strict view in applying Exception (1) set out in

Section 294 of the Penal Code. Our Judges following their

counterparts in England interpreted the phrase "sudden

provocation" to mean that provocation should consist of a single

act which occurred immediately before the killing so that there

was no time for the anger to cool and the act must have been

8 | P a g e

such that it would have made a reasonable man to react in the

manner as the accused did. Our Courts were reluctant to take

into consideration any special circumstances which manifested

in the particular offender's case.

Kulatilaka J further held that:

Of late we observe a development in other jurisdictions where

Courts and juries have taken a more pragmatic view of the

mitigatory plea of provocation. In a series of cases in applying

the mitigatory plea of provocation Courts took into consideration

the prior course of relationship between the accused and his

victim.

In R. W. M. Nandana Senarathbandara v Attorney General

SC/Appeal/32/2015 decided on 17/07/2020 his Lordship Jayantha

Jayasuriya CJ has held that:

Jurisprudence referred to above demonstrate that in

considering the plea of grave and sudden provocation an

accused is entitled to rely upon a series of prior events that

ultimately led to the incident at which the death was caused. A

court should not restrict its focus to an isolated incident that

resulted in the death, in considering a plea of grave and sudden

provocation. The aforementioned jurisprudence has widened the

scope of this plea by expanding the limitations recognised in its

statutory form. Thereby, the concept of Continuing or

Cumulative provocation has been recognised as a plea coming

within the purview of the plea of grave and sudden provocation

recognised under Exception 1, section 294 of the Penal Code.

Therefore, the proximity of time between the actus reus of the

accused and the provocative act of the victim should be

9 | P a g e

considered in the context of the nature and circumstances in

each case, in deciding whether an accused is entitled to the

benefit of the plea of Grave and Sudden Provocation..

Guided by above cited judgments, it is pertinent to consider whether the

benefit of the plea of Grave and Sudden Provocation on the basis of

Cumulative Provocation could be awarded to the Appellant as claimed by

him under this ground of appeal.

The evidence transpires that the wife of the Appellant had estranged from

him due to matrimonial disputes. Due to this several incidents have taken

place previously between the Appellant and deceaseds fractions. On

several occasions the Appellant had threatened the deceased that he would

shoot her. On the day preceding the murder, he had gone to deceaseds

house brandishing a knife and had threatened PW1, the deceased and the

deceaseds husband with death. The Appellant had not provided any

explanation why he had approached the deceased with a gun on the

following morning. In the light of his previous conduct it is evident that he

had a murderous intention. Further, considering the circumstances under

which the Appellant had shot the deceased, it cannot be considered in

favour of the Appellant for a plea of cumulative provocation under

Exception 1 to Section 294 of the Penal Code.

In R. W. M. Nandana Senarathbandara v Attorney General (supra) the

court held that:

The fact that the accused opened fire twice, the range of fire and the

location and nature of injuries on the deceased and the victim clearly

demonstrate the intention to kill entertained by the accused.

Therefore, this ground of appeal also fails without any merit.

10 | P a g e

For the reasons stated above, I am of the view that there is no merit in any

of the grounds of appeal urged by the Counsel for the Appellant. The

evidence presented by the prosecution establishes beyond reasonable

doubt that the Appellant is guilty of the charge with which he has been

convicted.

Accordingly, I affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed and dismiss

the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court

of Kandy along with the original case record.
