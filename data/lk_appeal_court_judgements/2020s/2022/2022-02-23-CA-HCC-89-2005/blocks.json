The defence need not prove anything in a criminal trial since the burden is on the prosecution to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. The courts acceptance of a police investigators notes as being circumstantially corroborative of that officers evidence and account of the events: when a police investigator testifies in court, they are usually permitted by the court to refer to their notes to refresh their memory and provide a full account of the events. If the investigator's notes are detailed and accurate, the court can give significant weight to the officer's account of those events. If the notes lack detail or are incomplete on significant points, the court may assign less value to the accuracy of the investigator's account.",
