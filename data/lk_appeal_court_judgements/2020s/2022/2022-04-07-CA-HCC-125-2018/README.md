R. Gurusinghe, J.

The accused-appellant (the appellant) was indicted in the High Court of

Colombo for (1) being in his possession of 4.378 grams of heroin, (2) trafficking

4.378 grams of heroin, (3) being in possession of 1.77 grams of heroin, and (4)

trafficking 1.77 grams of heroin; offences, that are punishable in terms of

section 54 A of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, as

amended by Act No 13 of 1984.

Having pleaded not guilty to the charges, the case proceeded for trial.

The learned Trial Judge, found the appellant guilty on all four charges and

imposed life imprisonment for the first two counts and seven years of rigorous

imprisonment each, for the third and fourth counts, to run concurrently.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the appellant preferred

this appeal, seeking to set aside the said judgment and the sentence.

3

The grounds of appeal, relied on by the appellant are as follows:

1. The evidence of PW1 is not credible enough to prove the case beyond

reasonable doubt.

2. The learned Trial Judge has failed to give due consideration to the

improbabilities of the evidence of PW1

3. The prosecution has failed to prove the exclusive possession of the

articles detected, according to the statement of the appellant, from a

house that belonged to some other person.

4. The failure of the prosecution to call the officer who had received the

information or other witnesses to affirm the position of the prosecution,

has curtailed the ability of the defense to attack the veracity of the

witnesses and thereby denied a fair trial.

The appellant made a dock statement on his behalf.

At the High Court trial, the prosecution had led the evidence of the following

witnesses:

1. PW1 I.P. Sarath Samarawickrema

2. PW3 - PS 26878 Obeysekera

3. PW4 - Assistant Government Analyst.

According to the evidence given by PW1, the raid was arranged by him

following a tip-off received by PW2(PS8595 Weerasooriya), a police officer

attached to the Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB) via a telephone call from the

informant. The police team went to Wadullawatte in the Orugodawatte area by

two three-wheelers attached to the PNB. All police officers were in an

undercover police operation at that time. They alighted at Orugodawatte, and

4

PW2 showed the informant to PW1. They thereafter followed the informant. In

about 10 to 15 minutes, the informant pointed out the appellant to PW1 and

left the place. The appellant was there under a lamp post looking in the other

lamp post direction. The officers approached the appellant, divulged to him

their identity and searched the appellant. He had in his possession, a

polythene bag consisting of three other small packets inside it, which he was

clenching in his fist. As he was an experienced officer, PW1 guessed the

contents to be heroin. The appellant was arrested, and the bag was taken into

custody after informing him of the charge of being suspected of possessing

illicit drugs.

After that, the appellant was questioned, and a statement was recorded. The

appellant revealed to the police the place where some money and heroin was

hidden. The police then went to a house that belonged to a person called

Asthambi. The doors of the house were opened, and nobody was there at that

time when the appellant and the police entered the house. The appellant had

shown the place under the cupboard, where a parcel with heroin and the

money was hidden. PW1 knelt down and projected his hand under the

cupboard and found the parcel, which contained money to the value of Rs.

318,520.00 and a small bag of heroin.

After examining the parcel that contained the other three packets, which was

allegedly in the appellants hand, it had been identified as having contained

heroin. The whole weight of each parcel had been measured as 10.4grams,

10.2grams, and 4.9grams, respectively. The three bags were sealed and named

A, B, and C and were put into another bag, sealed and named S1. The whole

weight of the bag found under the cupboard in Asthambis house was

measured at 10 grams. It was sealed and named as S2.

As per the evidence given by PW4, the government analyst, confirmed that the

parcel named as S1 had been identified as having contained heroin after

5

examination, which weighed 4.378 grams whilst the parcel named as S2

weighed 1.77 grams of heroin.

I first consider the 4th ground of appeal.

The failure of the prosecution to call the person who received the

information had curtailed the ability of the defence to attack the veracity

of the witnesses and thereby denied a fair trial.

In the case of the State vs Devunderage Nihal SC. Appeal 154/2 2010 decided

on 3.1.2019, Aluvihare J. stated as follows:

I am of the view that the court of Appeal erred when it held that the defence

should be provided with the opportunity to contradict the witnesses. As such I

answer the 3rd question of law also in the affirmative. For the reasons set out

above I hold that;

(a) An accused can be convicted on a single witness in a prosecution based on a

police detection if the judge forms the view that the evidence of such witness can,

with caution, be relied upon after probing the testimony.

(b) Corroboration is not sine qua non for a conviction in a police detection case, if

the judge, after probing, is of the opinion that the witness is credible and the

evidence can be acted upon without hesitation.

(c) There is no burden on the prosecution to provide an accused with the

opportunity to contradict the prosecution witnesses.

In the case of King vs Chalo Singho, 42 NLR 269, Justice Soertsz stated;

It must, therefore, be regarded as well-established law, that a prosecutor is not

bound to call all the witnesses on the indictment or to tender them for cross-

examination. That is a matter in his discretion, but in exceptional circumstances,

a judge might interfere to ask him to call a witness or to call a witness as a

6

witness of the court. It must, however, be said to the credit of prosecuting

Counsel today, that if they err at all in this matter, they err on the side of

fairness.

In the case of Walimunige John vs State 76 NLR 488, Justice G. P. A. Silva

held that;

The prosecution is not bound to call all the witnesses whose names appear on

the back of the indictment or to tender them for cross-examination. Further, it is

not incumbent on the trial Judge to direct the jury, save in exceptional

circumstances, that they may draw a presumption under section 114 (f) of the

Evidence Ordinance adverse to the prosecution from its failure to call one or more

of its witnesses at the trial without calling all.

As per the provisions of section 134 of the evidence ordinance, no particular

number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact.

The argument that the failure of the prosecution to adduce evidence of

Weerasooriya PW2, or other witnesses, curtailed the ability of the defence to

attack the veracity of the witnesses and thereby denied a fair trial, is identical

to the argument that had been rejected by the Supreme Court in the State vs

Devunderage Nihal SC. Appeal 154/2 2010 decided on 3.1.2019.

When I consider this argument with the applicable law and in light of the

aforesaid judicial pronouncements, I would like to reject the contention of the

learned Counsel.

Now I deal with the second and fourth counts regarding trafficking.

If somebody is in possession of dangerous drugs and sells them or intends

them to be sold, it could be considered as trafficking. The definition of

trafficking in section 54 of the ordinance is thus,

7

"traffick" means (a) to sell, give, procure, store, administer, transport, send,

deliver or distribute; or (b) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a).

In the case of Mohomed Iqbal Mohomed Saddath vs Honorable Attorney General

SC, appeal 110/15 decided on 14/12/2020, Aluvihare J. held as follows:

41. As far as the mental element is concerned, I am of the view that the offence

of [drug] trafficking is similar to possession since it requires to be established

that 16 the perpetrator knowingly possessed or had control over a dangerous

drug. Thus, one cannot engage in drug trafficking while being unaware that he or

she is in possession of a drug, or if he or she reasonably but mistakenly believes

that the substance is legal. The offence of drug trafficking, however, also

requires that the Prosecution establish that the perpetrator was involved

in the selling, procuring, storing, administering, transporting, delivering

or distributing of such drugs, or had offered to do anything referred to

above [Definition of the term traffic in section 54 A of the Ordinance].

It is this additional requirement [of an act] that transforms the status of

the offence [of possession] to trafficking.

42. Since possession and trafficking can look the same at first glance,

Prosecution for drug trafficking typically requires producing additional

circumstantial evidence to indicate that the Accused was in possession of drugs

not for personal use but for commercial purposes. The quantity of the drug

detected would be a good indicator to decide whether the perpetrator is a user

[an addict] or is trading in drugs. This would be a question of fact. It is in this

context, it was stated at the commencement of this judgement that the 4th

question of law raised by the State, on which special leave was granted, does

not contain a question of law, thus, this court will not endeavour to answer that

question.

The prosecution has not provided additional evidence to show that the

appellant was in possession of drugs not only for personal use but for

8

commercial purposes. The police has not found any money in possession of the

appellant before going to Asthambis house. No evidence adduced to say that

the amount of heroin involved in this case is excessive than the amount that

can usually be found in possession of an ordinary drug addict. Therefore, the

court has no ground to say that the appellant was keeping the heroin for

trafficking. Therefore, I am of the view that the prosecution has failed to prove

the second count in the indictment and therefore, the appellant should be

acquitted from the same.

The next argument is that the prosecution has failed to prove exclusive

possession regarding the money and the heroin found in the house of

Asthambi.

When the police went to the house of Asthambi, the doors were opened and

there was nobody inside at that time. However, it is apparent that though the

house belonged to Asthambi, some other people had also lived there. Besides,

the police failed to record a statement from Asthambi regarding the parcel and

the money found in his house. The heroin and money was not in possession of

the appellant at that time. The only fact proved by the evidence is that the

appellant knew the place where the heroin and money was located. The parcel

was not in his sole custody. In such a scenario, to prove the liability of the

accused, the prosecution must lead additional evidence to show that the

appellant had the ability to control the said dangerous drugs and that he had

the intention to exercise control over them. The prosecution has failed to prove

that the appellant had the power and intention to control the place where the

second parcel was found. Therefore, I hold that the third and fourth charges

have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

I now consider the first and second grounds of appeal together, that is the

evidence of PW1 is not credible enough to prove the case beyond

reasonable doubt and the learned Trial Judge has failed to give due

consideration to the improbabilities of the evidence of PW1.

9

As per the evidence of PW1, the informant had shown the appellant from a

distance of 40 meters. The appellant was looking at the other direction so that

he could not see the police personal approaching him. I think it is not

probable that the appellant allegedly being a drug seller, who are generally

said to be vigilant about what is happening around them, did not turn to the

other side until the three police officers had covered that 40 meters on foot.

As per the evidence of PW1, the appellant was standing in front of his house.

It is not normal behaviour for a person to sell illicit substance in front of his

house. It is also unusual that the appellant was clenching (

) the heroin in his fist for such a long time until the police took it into

their custody. The police had searched the appellants house. The appellants

wife and the mother-in-law was there. The police team had not found any

illegal substance in the house of the appellant. At the time when the appellant

was arrested, he did not have any money in his possession. As per the

evidence of PW1, within a few minutes after the arrest of the appellant, the

appellant had divulged that there was a parcel with money and heroin in a

house about 10 meters away from the appellants house. The police team went

to that house with the appellant. The doors of the house was opened.

However, nobody was there in the house. They entered the living room and

then to another room where, under a cupboard the police found a bag with

1.77grams of heroin and Rs. 318,520.00. The police team did not bother to

record a statement from the owner of the house or from any inmate of the

house.

A part of the evidence of PW1 relevant to this are as follows:

PW1 also stated that there were household goods and that shows that some

people were living there in the house at the time of the incident. Yet they did

not even bother to close the doors when they were leaving the place. It is

amounting to trespassing the house. The police officers were not in their

uniforms. Even at a later stage of the investigation, the police had not

informed the owner of the house that they had entered the house, while they

were in an under cover police operation and took a bag with money and

heroin, which was kept under a cupboard in his house. This behavior of the

police was not natural and unbelievable. They should have asked from the

owner of the house at least what he had to say about the recovery of money

and heroin. That was a place where the residents of the house had access to

and it is also possible that what had been recovered belonged to one of the

residents of the house. The above circumstances create a reasonable doubt of

the whole prosecution version. It is not reasonable to rely on such evidence to

convict a person for an offence, to which the only punishment prescribed by

law is death or life imprisonment.

None of the witnesses had given evidence before the learned High Court Judge

who wrote the judgment. The prosecutions case was closed on 8th February

2016 and the defence case was closed on 10th March 2016, before the previous

High Court Judge. Therefore, the learned High Court Judge who wrote the

judgment did not have the opportunity to observe evidence including the

demeanor and deportment of the witnesses. The judgment was delivered on

25th July 2018.

In the case of the State vs Devunderage Nihal SC. Appeal 154/2 2010 decided

on 3.1.2019 Aluvihare J. stated that: It is the trial judge who would have the

12

benefit of observing the manner in which a witness faces the cross-examination.

Hence, in the absence of any other infirmities, having considered all these

matters, if the trial judge forms the opinion that the witness is credible, I do not

think the trial judge has any other option other than to accept the evidence and

to act on it.

However, the above observation of the Supreme Court cannot be applied to

this case, as there are a number of infirmities in the evidence and the Judge

who wrote the judgment did not have the opportunity to see any of the

witnesses in this case.

Evidence of PW1, taken as a whole cannot be concluded as cogent and reliable.

In the case of Martin Fernando v Inspector of Police,Minuwangoda 46 NLR 210

Wijewardena, J redefined the role of the Appellate Court. It is as follows;

An Appellate Court is not absolved from the duty of testing the evidence

extrinsically as well as intrinsically although the decision of the Judge on

question of facts based on demeanour and credibility of witnesses carries great

weight. Where a close examination of the evidence raises a strong doubt as to

the guilt of the accused, he should be given the benefit of the doubt

In the case of Munasinghe v Vidanage 69 NLR 97 The Privy Council made the

following observation :

If there is no evidence to support a particular conclusion (and this is really a

question of law) the appellate court will not hesitate so to decide. But if the

evidence as a whole can reasonably be regarded as justifying the conclusion

arrived at at the trial, and especially if that conclusion has been arrived at on

conflicting testimony by a tribunal which saw and heard the witnesses, the

appellate court will bear in mind that it has not enjoyed this opportunity and

that the view of the trial judge as to where credibility lies is entitled to great

weight. This is not to say that the judge of first instance can be treated as

13

infallible in determining which side is telling the truth or is refraining from

exaggeration. Like other tribunals, he may go wrong on a question of fact, but

it is a cogent circumstance that a judge of first instance, when estimating the

value of verbal testimony, has the advantage (which is denied to courts of

appeal) of having the witnesses before him and observing the manner in which

their evidence is given. per Viscount Simon in Watt or Thomas v. Thomas

(1947 A. C. 484 at pp. 485-0).

Whether the evidence is sufficient to support a particular conclusion is a

question of law that can be considered by the Appellate Court.

In these circumstances, I am of the view that the charges against the appellant

are not proved beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore I set aside the judgment of

High Court dated 25th July 2018. The conviction and the sentence is quashed.

The appellant is acquitted of all four charges.

The appeal is allowed.
