More people who had been hiding behind the lottery hut have come and started stabbing the brother. Altogether she has seen five assailants. She has cried out for help. She has identified the four persons who have come out of the hiding from behind the hut as persons she has seen before in courts. One person by the name of Chaminda Kumara alias Kodiya has been known to her. She has seen two persons holding knives. When she cried out, she realized that she was also stabbed. According to her, along with the people who held knives and stabbed the deceased the others have also assaulted him before they took to their heels. Thereafter, she has taken the deceased brother to the hospital. She was also treated for the stab injury that she had sustained on the back of her shoulder. 4. It was evident that her brother was a suspect in a case in the Mount Lavinia Magistrate Court where he was charged for attempting to kill the said Kodiya by shooting. When she went to the police station from the hospital to make the complaint, she has seen the appellant under arrest. She has also seen the knife that was recovered from the appellant by the police at the police station. 5.

When he arrested the appellant, he has had a knife in his possession which was taken as a production. 6. It has been evident that the PW1 has not attended court to participate in the identification parade as a witness to identify the suspects who were produced before the Magistrate Court. Further, PW1 has not attended the Magistrate Court for the non-summary proceedings. Her evidence was that she has been in hiding, due to the fear of death threats that she has received. 7. The learned Counsel for the appellant contended that, the appellant has not been properly identified by the witnesses at the trial as a person who was involved in the murder of the deceased. The learned Counsel further submitted that, the PW1 has failed to attend the identification parade and therefore, identification of the appellant from the dock at the trial cannot be considered as proper identification of the appellant, to safely convict him. It is the contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent that the appellant has been properly identified as one of the assailants, as the appellant was arrested by the police officer immediately after the incident, when the appellant was running away with the other assailants. 8.

The identification of an accused for the first time in the dock is an undesirable practice. (R. v. Cartwright, 10 Cr.Ap.R. 219,CCA). It is settled law that little or no weight should be given for dock identification as a witness may tend to identify the accused already in the dock assuming that he may have been the person who committed the crime. A trial Judge may permit dock identification if the Court finds that the failure to conduct an identification parade was a result of the suspects conduct or default. However, it is important that the Judge directs himself of the danger of dock identification, reliability of the witness and also whether the accused had a fair trial. 9. In case of Holland v. HM Advocate ([2005] UKPC D 1; The Times, 1 June 2005), it was held that permitting a dock identification was not per se incompatible with the right to a fair trial. Factors to weigh in the equation of whether an accused had had a fair trial would include whether he was legally represented, what directions the Judge has given about identification evidence and the significance of the contested evidence in the context of the case as a whole. (Archbold Criminal Pleading Evidence and Practice 2019 at page 1854). 10. In case of Terrell Nailly v. The Queen [2012] UK",

It is the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that, there is no direct evidence that the appellant inflicted the fatal injury on the deceased, and therefore the appellant could not have been convicted based on individual liability. The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent submitted that the learned trial Judge has found the appellant guilty on count no. 3 based on acting in furtherance of common intention with others unknown to the prosecution. In that, the learned Deputy Solicitor General further submitted that the rest of the persons accused of the murder in the Magistrate Court were acquitted in the non-summary inquiry. 15.
