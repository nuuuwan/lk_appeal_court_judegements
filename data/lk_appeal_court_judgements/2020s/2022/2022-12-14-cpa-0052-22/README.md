Before: MenakaWijesundera J.

Neil Iddawala J.

Counsel: Tenny Fernando appears for the Accused Appellant.

PanchaliWitharana, SC for the state.

Argued on: 17.11.2022

Decided on: 14.12.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to set aside the order dated

1.4.2022 of the High Court of Gampaha.

The accused in the instant matter had been indicted for being in

possession of 177.74 grammas of heroin in the High Court. He had been

taken in to custody in 2019 and he had been indicted in 2021 but the

trial had not yet commenced.

The main ground urged by the Counsel for the accused is that,

1) The likelihood of the trial being concluded in the near future being

very remote,

2) The main investigative officers of the matter being accused for

similar offences hence the credibility of the prosecution witnesses being

questionable,

3) The health condition of the accused.

The Counsel appearing for the respondents vehemently objected to the

application and stated that this Court cannot go in to the merits of the

case in a bail application.

The law pertaining to the instant matter is that the accused in the

instant matter had been indicted under the provisions of the Poisons

Opium and Dangerous Drugs act and according to the latest

amendment to the act no 41 of 2022 under which if the accused is

indicted or produced under section 54 And B of the act and if it is more

than 10 grams bail can be considered by the Court of Appeal only on

exceptional grounds.

As it had been said in many of our decided cases by this bench the term

exceptional has not been defined in the statute but it has been decided

in many of the cases so far decided that exceptionality defers from case

to case.

In the instant matter the exceptional circumstances cited are stated

above. But it has been held in the recently decided case by the Supreme

Page 4 of 4

Court in SC Application 53-2022 that the credit worthiness of

witnesses and morality cannot be considered in a bail application.

But we take in to consideration the health condition of the accused

which is substantiated by medical reports which say that the accused is

suffering from a continuing illness termed as the double vessel disease

and had undergone treatment at a Private Hospital.

Hence receiving treatment inside the prison seem to be very remote

and as such it is the considered view of this Court that it is only but fair

to enlarge the accused on bail as the conclusion of the trial in the near

future appear to be very remote.

As such the instant application is allowed and the order of the High

Court is hereby set-aside and we direct the learned High Court Judge to

enlarge the above named accused on suitable conditions of bail.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
