MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant matter has been filed to obtain bail for Abdul Satthar Fowzul Ahamed

under the Provisions of the Assistance to and Protection of victims of Crime and

Witnesses Act, No. 04 of 2015.

The Counsel for the Accused Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Accused)

stated that the complainant has lodged the instant complaint on 21/11/2021, but he

had been arrested and produced before the Magistrate on 30/06/2022 which is 06

months after the complaint. The substantive matter in the instant case has been

that the Accused committed offences under Section 433 and 410 of the Penal Code

on 25/01/2019. By the time the instant complaint had been made the evidence of

the complainant in the substantive matter had been partly concluded. The instant

complaint is with regard to an alleged threat of throwing Petrol. But the Counsel for

the Accused submitted that the intention of the police had been to incarcerate the

Page 3 of 4

Accused falsely and that it is well demonstrated by the fact that the Accused had

been arrested for the instant matter after 06 months from the complaint.

The State Counsel appearing for the Respondents objected for bail being granted and

stated that the police took six months to file charges because the accused had been

absconding.

Having considered the submissions of both parties, this Court is mindful of the fact

that the purpose of the instant act is to safeguard the rights of Victims of Witnesses

but in the same act it is stated that matters filed under this act should be given

precedence, which is to safeguard the rights of all parties.

In the instant matter Court observes that the alleged act of threat had taken place

when the evidence of the victim in the substantive matter was nearing conclusion,

and as such as it is by now obviously the evidence of the victim should be concluded

and as such it is the opinion of this Court that the accused should be enlarged on bail,

hence the Accused namely Abdul Sather FowzulAhmed is enlarged on the following

conditions of bail.

01. A cash bail of Rs. 125,000/- 02. Two sureties to the value of 200,000/- each. 03. The accused to report to the relevant Police Station on every last Sunday of the

month. 04. The accused is hereby severely warned not to interfere with the complainant

or the family members. If it is reported the instant bail order would be cancelled.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to convey the instant order to the

Registrar of the relevant Magistrates Court. Hereby the instant order for bail is

allowed.
