S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) instituted the instant

partition action in the District Court of Avissawella seeking to partition a land called

and known as Kahatagahawatta. Before the institution of the instant action, the same

land was sought to be partitioned by one Martin Singho in P 8179 and by the Plaintiff

in P 11863. Nevertheless, both actions were withdrawn without proceeding to trial.

Thereafter, the Plaintiff has instituted the instant action bearing No. P 13796. The

instant action proceeded to trial on 2 admissions and 15 points of contest recorded on

31.06.1990. Accordingly, it has been admitted by the parties that the land sought to be

partitioned is depicted in Plan No. 82 A dated 20.04.1974 (marked as X) prepared by

the Surveyor Mr. Welagedara as lots 1 and 2 and that the original owner of that land

was Baba Appu. Even through, it has not been recorded as admissions, the parties are

not at variance about the facts that said Baba Appu had 4 children namely, David alias

Jarcolis, Naris, Julis and Juwanis, that said Juwanis died intestate and issueless and his

5

rights were devolved on his siblings, David alias Jarcolis, Naris and Julis hereinbefore

mentioned.

The instant action has been instituted by the Plaintiff on the basis that said Naris and

Julis also died intestate and issueless and therefore, their rights were devolved on David

alias Jacolis and he became the sole owner of the land sought to be partitioned. At the

trial, changing his position, the Plaintiff has testified that Naris and Julis had no legally

valid marriages and therefore, their children would not inherit their rights of the land.

The position of the 4th to 7th Defendant-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the 4th

to 7th Defendants) have been that the co-owners of the land sought to be partitioned had

executed the amicable partition agreement dated 30.06.1943 marked 3 6 and prepared

a partition plan bearing No. 724 dated 12.07.1943 marked 3 8 through the Surveyor

Mr. Rodrigues according to the amicable partition agreement marked 3 6. Therefore,

the argument of the 4th to 7th Defendants has been that since the land sought to be

partitioned has been amicably partitioned between the co-owners, the Plaintiff is not

entitled to maintain the action. Plan marked 3 8 has been superimposed by the

Commissioner of the case, Mr. welagedara on a copy of his preliminary plan marked X

and prepared the superimposition plan and the report marked 3 9 and 3 9

respectively. According to the report marked 3 9 , the Court could be satisfied that

the land shown in the preliminary plan marked X is identical to the land shown in the

superimposed plan marked 3 9.

By the impugned judgment dated 13.03.1997, the learned Additional District Judge has

held that the Plaintiff has failed to prove the pedigree to the land and it has been proved

that the land sought to be partitioned had been divided among the co-owners as per the

amicable partition plan marked 3 8 and possessed the land by them according to that

6

plan. On that basis the action has been dismissed by the learned Additional District

Judge.

For the convenience of the Court, I will first consider whether there had been evidence

in the case for the learned Additional District Judge to come to the conclusion that after

the amicable partition plan marked 3 8 was prepared the co-owners had possessed the

land according to that plan. By the amicable partition agreement dated 30.06.1943

marked 3 6, it has been agreed by the co-owners to prepare a partition plan and

accordingly, the plan No. 724 dated 12.07.1943 marked 3 8 had been prepared by the

Surveyor Mr. Rodrigues. Nevertheless, there is no evidence before the Court that the

parties to the agreement marked 3 6 had possessed the land according to 3 8. The

Plaintiff has denied the fact that plan marked 3 8 had been prepared and that the co-

owners had possessed the land according to that plan. On behalf of the defence, only

the 6th Defendant has given evidence at the trial. Nowhere in his testimony he has stated

that the co-owners of the land have possessed the land according to the amicable

partition plan prepared by Mr. Rodrigues in the year 1943 marked 3 8. According to

the preliminary plan and report marked X and X1 respectively, and the superimposition

plan and the report prepared by the Commissioner of the case Mr. Welagedara marked

3 9 and 3 9 respectively, there are no definite boundaries situated physically on

the ground to separate the land into lots as depicted in the amicable partition plan

marked 3 8. No Surveyor has given evidence at the trial. Apart from that the deeds

produced at the trial on behalf of both parties, marked 1 dated 24.05.1973, 3 2

dated 22.02.1948, 3 1 dated 26.07.1955, 3 7 dated 04.12.1933 and 3 8 dated

01.08.1953 which were executed subsequent to the amicable partition agreement dated

30.06.1943 marked 3 6 was made and the partition plan dated 12.07.1943 marked 3

8 was prepared neither speaks about 3 6 nor 3 8. Under the above stated

7

circumstances, I hold that the 4th to 7th Defendants have failed to prove that the co-

ownership of the parties had come to an end, after the amicable partition agreement and

the plan were prepared for the reason that there is no evidence that the co-owners have

acted upon and possessed the land according to the amicable partition agreement and

the plan.

Now I will consider the contest regarding the pedigree. In the 2nd paragraph of the Plaint

dated 12.11.1973 (at page 65 of the appeal brief) it has been stated that Naris and Julis

died unmarried and issueless. The Plaintiff was the 2nd Defendant in the partition action

bearing No P 8179. In his amended statement of claim dated 29.05.1958 marked 3 4

(at page 271 of the appeal brief) the Plaintiff had admitted inter alia, that Julis died,

leaving 7 children, each of them became entitled to 1/7 share of Juliss rights and the 7

children of julis had acquired prescriptive rights to the Juliss rights.

Apart from the above stated facts, the Plaintiff had bought rights of the land sought to

be partitioned from one Bodhipala on deed No. 11492 dated 26.07.1955 marked 3 1.

Said Bodhipala had derived title to the land on deed No. 8645 dated 22.02.1948 marked

3 2 and the vendor of 3 2 is one Sandohamy. She had transferred on 3 2, the rights

she inherited from her father, Julis. It is relevant to note that the Plaintiff had obtained

an injunction in P 8179 in the year 1961 against the 5th Defendant to restrain him from

constructing a building on the land sought to be partitioned on the basis that the Plaintiff

had acquired rights of the land on the hereinbefore mentioned deed marked 3 1. Under

such circumstances, the Plaintiff could not argue that Julis demised intestate and

issueless or he had no legally valid marriage and therefore, his children would not

inherit Juliss rights. According to the Defence, upon the death of Julis, his rights have

been devolved on his 7 children, namely; Podihamy, Helenahamy, Sandohamy,

Disihamy, Podisingho, Thasohamy and Kumanaris.

8

Even though, the Plaintiff has instituted the instant action on the basis that Naris and

Julis had died unmarried and issueless, while giving evidence at the trial he had

attempted to say that said Naris and Julis had not contracted legally vailed marriages

and therefore, David became the owner of the entire land sought to be partitioned. That

position of the Plaintiff has been based on the journal entry dated 27.10.1965 (marked

3) of the case record in P 8179. According to that journal entry, the learned Counsel

who had appeared for Martin singho who was the plaintiff in that action had submitted

to the Court that he is withdrawing the action for the reason that the vendor of the deed

in favour of Martin singho was not married to Julis and therefore, Martin singho cannot

maintain the action. Martin singhos rights to the land had been based on a deed

executed in his favour by a woman who had recited her title to the land as the wife of

Julis. In that journal entry, the learned Counsel who had appeared for the 11th and 12th

Defendants (the 1st and 2nd Defendants in the instant action) had submitted to the Court

that out of 4 children of Baba Appu, only David was married. The argument on behalf

of the Plaintiff in the instant action has been that in view of the above stated submissions

recorded in the journal entry marked -3, the parties had admitted that Naris and Julis

had no legally valid marriages and therefore, their rights had been devolved upon their

brother, David. Other than the 1st and 2nd Defendants neither the Plaintiff nor the other

Defendants in the instant action had been parties to the action bearing No. P 8179.

Even though, the facts stated in -3 had been recorded as submissions of the learned

Counsel appeared for the plaintiff and the 11th and 12th defendants in P 8179, those facts

were not recorded in that case as formal admissions between the parties.

When cross-examining on 18.11.1982, the Plaintiff has testified thus;

9

, , .

.... .

. (at page 90 of the appeal brief.)

As per the said evidence of the Plaintiff, it is evident that he had no knowledge about

the inheritance under Naris and Julis. Under the above stated circumstances, the Court

can come to the conclusion that the Plaintiff has failed to prove that Naris and Julis had

not contracted legally valid marriages.

According to the evidence placed before the learned Additional District Judge, upon

the death of Naris his rights had been devolved on his 4 children, namely; Wastuhamy,

Sophihamy, Karlinahamy, Singhappu and Abilinsingho. Other than said Wastuhamy,

the other 3 children of Naris had transferred their rights to Wijesinghe Appuhamy on

deed bearing No. 14692 dated 14.12.1919 marked 3 9. There is no evidence about the

devolution of the rights under said Wastuhamy and Wijesinghe Appuhamy. Therefore,

the Court will leave the rights of said two persons un-allotted and anyone who is entitled

to that rights could prove rights before the District Court and claim those rights.

There had been evidence in the case that Julis had died intestate and issueless leaving

7 children as his heirs, namely; Podihamy, Helenahamy, Sandohamy, Disihamy, Podi

Singho, Thesohamy and Kumaneris. Said Sandohamys rights had been devolved on

Bodhipala on deed No. 8645 dated 22.02.1948 marked 3 2 and he had transferred his

rights to the Plaintiff by deed No. 11492 dated 26.07.1955 marked 3 1. Upon the

death of Disihamy her rights had been devolved upon her daughter, Pransina, the 4th

Defendant. Thesohamy had conveyed his rights to Simiyonsingho and Elisahamy on

deed No. 13056 dated 04.12.1933 marked 3 7 and they had transferred their rights to

Piyasena, the 7th Defendant on deed No. 12435 dated 05.06.1953 marked 3 8. There

10

is no evidence acceptable to the Court about the devolution of rights under Podihamy,

Helenahamy, Podisingho and Kumaneris. Therefore, their rights will be left un-allotted

and anyone who is entitled to those rights could prove rights before the District Court

and claim those rights.

The original owner, Baba Appus child David alias Jacoliss rights had been devolved

upon his death on his children; Peirissingho (the 1st Defendant), Carolissingho (the 2nd

Defendant), Sophyhamy and Johanahamy. Sophyhamy and Johanahamy had

transferred their rights by deed No. 12964 dated 24.05.1973 marked 1 to the Plaintiff.

There is no evidence to prove that the co-owners had acquired prescriptive rights over

the other co-owners.

The parties are entitled to the following undivided shares of the land depicted in plan

marked X as lots 1 and 2.

Plaintiff 90/420

1st Defendant 35/420

2nd Defendant -35/420

4th Defendant 20/420

7th Defendant -20/420

Podihamy -20/420

Helenahamy -20/420

11

The 4th Defendant is entitled to 4 Lunumidella trees between the age of 25-30 years and

2 Jack trees between the age of 30-40 years in lot 1 mentioned in the Surveyor report

marked X1. Other than the said plantation, the parties are entitled to all other plantation

and improvements in lots 1 and 2 as claimed by them before the Surveyor. The Surveyor

is directed to partition the land in a manner which could be included the plantation and

other improvements claimed by the parties before the Surveyor as far as possible. The

cost of the case should be taxed cost and cost of litigation. The parties should bear the

costs proportionately. The Plaintiff should bear the costs in respect of the un-allotted

shares and he could recover the same from the parties who would be declared entitled

to those un-allotted shares. The learned Additional District Judge is directed to enter an

interlocutory decree according to his judgement. Impugned judgement dated

12.03.1993 of the learned Additional District Judge is set aside. No costs ordered.
