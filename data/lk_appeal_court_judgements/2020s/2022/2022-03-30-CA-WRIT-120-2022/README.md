Before : Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

Dhammika Ganepola J.

Counsel : Nagananda Kodithuwakku for the Petitioner Navodi de Zoysa, SC for the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents Supported on : 25.03.2022

Decided on : 30.03.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner in this application seeks for a writ of prohibition preventing the decision

purportedly taken by the 1st & 2nd Respondents to remove the pandu karanda tree under

the Binomial name Crudia zeylanica (Tree) marked in the document X1 which is annexed

to the Petition. A writ of mandamus is also being sought to prevent the 1st & 2nd

Respondents removing the said Tree from the place it has been propagated. The Petitioner

claims that the said Tree is an endangered plant species and the 1st & 2nd Respondents are

taking steps to remove the said Tree paving way for the construction of the Central

expressway between Kadawatha and Meerigama without changing the right of way of the

relevant portion of the said expressway.

Although the 1st, 2nd & 4th Respondents are represented by the learned State Counsel, the

3rd Respondent District Forest Officer is absent and unrepresented. The learned Counsel

for the Petitioner informs Court that the 3rd Respondent had intimated to him the fact that

the notice of this case had been received by her. The said 3rd Respondent has not retained

the Attorney General or any other Counsel to represent her in Court.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the 1st & 2nd Respondents

have violated the responsibility vested in those Respondents under Article 4(d), 27(2) and

28(f) of the Constitution of the Republic. On perusal of the several paragraphs of the

Petition and also based on the submissions made on behalf of the Petitioner, it implies that

the legal basis for the Petitioner to invoke the discretionary jurisdiction of this Court in the

instant application for judicial review, is the purported violation of the said Articles of the

Constitution by the 1st & 2nd Respondents.

Page 3 of 10

The said Article 4 of the Constitution stipulates that the sovereignty of the people shall be

exercised and enjoyed in the manner mentioned in the said Article. The Article 4(d) reads;

the fundamental rights which are by the Constitution declared and recognized shall be

respected, secured and advanced by all the organs of government and shall not be abridged,

restricted or denied, save in the manner and to the extent hereinafter provided

The other Constitutional provisions highlighted by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner

are Articles 27(2) & 28(f) of Chapter VI of the Constitution and the said Article 27(2) deals

with the Directive Principles of State Policy whereas, the Article 28(f) stipulates that, it is

the duty of every person in Sri Lanka to protect nature and conserve its riches. Though the

learned Counsel relies upon the provisions of those Articles, it is pertinent to note that the

Article 29 of the Constitution declares that the provisions of the said Chapter VI do not

confer or impose legal rights or obligations and are not enforceable in any court or tribunal.

In Re Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the Provincial Councils Bill [(1987) 2 Sri.

L.R. 312 (at p. 326) the Supreme Court has observed that the Directive Principles require

to be implemented by legislation.

Further, it is important to note that in terms of Article 126(1) of the Constitution, the

Supreme Court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any

question relating to the infringement or imminent infringement by executive or

administrative action of any fundamental right or language right declared and recognized

by Chapter III or Chapter IV of the Constitution.

This Court exercises the writ jurisdiction in applications for judicial review under Article

140 of the Constitution by which the Court of Appeal shall have full power and authority

to grant and issue orders in the nature of writs of Certiorari, Mandamus etc. However, in

terms of the said provisions of Article 140, the Court of Appeal is empowered to grant and

issue such writs only according to law. Therefore, a Petitioner in a judicial review

application should emphasize the legal basis upon which he is entitled to the reliefs under

Article 140 of the Constitution. In Nicholas vs. Macan Marker Limited (1985) 1 Sri. L.R. 130

(at p.139), the Court has held that the question before the Court in a judicial review

application is whether the impugned decision or order is lawful and whether it is according

to law. In Kalamazoo Industries Limited and others vs. Minister of Labour and Vocational

Training and others (1998) 1 Sri. L.R. 235 (at p.249), Jayasuriya J. has observed the

Page 4 of 10

principles laid down by Prof. H.W.R. Wade in Administrative Law (12th Edition at pages

34 & 35) wherein the author has stated as follows;

Judicial review is radically different from the system of appeals. When hearing an appeal,

the Court is concerned with the merits of the decision under appeal. But in judicial review,

the Court is concerned with its legality. On appeal, the question is right or wrong. On review,

the question is lawful or unlawful....judicial review is a fundamentally different

operation. (Emphasis added)

In Public Interest Law Foundation vs. Central Environmental Authority and another (2001) 3

Sri. L.R. 330 (at p.334), Gunawardena J. has held;

Under judicial review procedure, the Court of Appeal is not concerned with the merits of the

case, that is, whether the decision was right or wrong but whether the decision is lawful or

not. In the words of Lord Brightman: Judicial Review is concerned, not with the decision

but with the decision-making process. (Chief Constable of North Wales Police vs. Evans

[1982] 1 WLR 1155 at 1173) It is worth observing that the review procedure is not well

suited to determination of disputed facts-factual issues arising in this case being imprecise

and disputed (Emphasis added)

Therefore, I am of the view that the objective of this Court upon the instant application

for judicial review is to consider whether the purported decision of the 1st & 2nd

Respondents is lawful or unlawful. On careful perusal of the Petition and the Affidavit of

the Petitioner, it emanates that nowhere in such pleadings the Petitioner has averred that

any decision of the 1st & 2nd Respondents is ultra vires or unlawful etc. In spite of averring

any ground of review, the Petitioner in paragraph 9 of the Petition, categorically indicates

that the 1st & 2nd Respondents have violated a constitutional responsibility. Other than

such averments the Petitioner has not pleaded any ground of review in order to establish

the decision-making process of the 1st & 2nd Respondents was unlawful.

As mentioned above, the Petitioner has come before this Court based on a purported

violation of the aforesaid Articles of the Constitution. If the Petitioner alleges an

infringement of any fundamental right, as mentioned in Article 4(d), then the sole and

exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine such question relating to the infringement of

fundamental rights is solely, in terms of the aforesaid Article 126(1), vested in the Supreme

Court. Moreover, it doesnt appear that there is prima facie and acceptable evidence before

us of an infringement or imminent infringement of the provisions of Chapter III or Chapter

Page 5 of 10

IV by the 1st & 2nd Respondents, for this Court to refer this matter under Article 126(3) of

the Constitution for determination by the Supreme Court. It is apparent that no such

application has been made by the Petitioner under the said Article 126(3).

Thus, I hold that the Petitioners application for judicial review is misconceived in law

based on my above findings.

Anyhow, I need to advert to the objections raised by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner,

against the documents filed on behalf of the 1st & 2nd Respondents. Firstly, referring to the

Rule No. 3(5) of the Court of Appeal Rules (published in the Extraordinary Gazette

Notification No. 645/4 on 15.01.1991), he submits that those documents filed by the

Respondents have not been supported by an affidavit. The said Rule 3(5) reads;

3(5) Every respondent who lodges a statement of objections, and every petitioner

who lodges a counter affidavit shall forthwith serve a copy thereof, together with

any supporting affidavit and exhibits on every other party (other than a party who

waives the right to receive the same).

The above Rule referred to by the said learned Counsel deals with statements of objection

and the counter objections and accordingly, I cannot see the said Rule having any

relevancy to the above objections raised. When this matter was taken up for support on

24.03.2022, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner moved to get the matter refixed for

support on a specific ground based on another important Rule of the Supreme Court Rules

and on the same day the Court permitted the 1st, 2nd & 4th Respondents to file necessary

documents by way of a motion with notice to the Petitioner. Upon such permission being

granted the 2nd Respondent has filed documents marked X1 to X10 along with a motion

of which a copy has been duly served on the Petitioner. At the time of granting such

permission for the Respondents, the Court was mindful of the Rule No. 3(8) of the above

Court of Appeal Rules which reads:

3(8) A party may, with the prior permission of the Court, amend his pleadings, or

file additional pleadings affidavits or other documents, within two weeks of the

grant of such permission, unless the Court otherwise directs. After notice has been

issued, such permission shall be not be granted ex parte. (Emphasis added)

Therefore, in view of the prior permission granted by the Court and also based on the

circumstances of this case, I am unable to accept the proposition of the Petitioner who

demands for the requirement of an affidavit by the 2nd Respondent at this stage. On the

Page 6 of 10

other hand, it is observed that the Petitioner relied only upon the documents marked X1

to X4 among which a single compact disc has been marked as X2 and X3. The learned

Counsel for the Petitioner intimated to Court that he was unable to establish the

authenticity of the document marked X1 although, the Petitioner claims that the X1

had been prepared by the 3rd Respondent. The publication dates of the purported news

items contained in the said compact disc also have not been divulged. The X4 is an

email copy of a letter allegedly written by the Petitioner wherein he has stated that there

was a move by the authorities to remove the said Tree.

It is important to bear in mind that the documents which are accompanied to the Petition

should be submitted in terms of Rule No. 3(1)(a) of the said Court of Appeal Rules.

Accordingly, the originals of such documents or duly certified copies thereof should be

submitted to Court and if a Petitioner is unable to tender any such document, he should

state the reason for such inability and seek the leave of the Court to furnish such documents

later. No such application has been made by the learned Counsel in open Court or by the

Petitioner in his Petition. However, it is observed that all the copies of the documents

submitted by the 2nd Respondent marked as X1 to X101 are duly authenticated and

certified as true copies. In the light of the above, the objections raised by the learned

Counsel of the Petitioner, in my view, are not tenable.

Furthermore, I need to examine the particular submissions made by the learned Counsel

for the Petitioner citing the order in SC(FR)109/2021 (Centre for Environmental Justice and

others vs. Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa and others, decided on 01.12.2021). The learned Counsel

highlighted the last four paragraphs of the said order in support of the Petitioners claim

in the instant application. The said order of the Supreme Court has been made to resolve

the issues pertaining to the objections raised by the State upon an amended Petition filed

by the Petitioner in that case. The crux of the above order of their Lordships is that the

Court should not allow procedural defects of the nature alleged in that matter to shackle

its constitutional duty to examine the allegations of the Petitioner at the leave to proceed

stage. Hence, I cannot understand the direct relevancy of the said order to the instant

application as there was no application by the Petitioner to amend his Petition and also

due to the fact that this is not a Fundamental Rights application.

1 Both the Petitioner as well as the 2nd Respondent have marked the respective documents using the letter X.

Although, I have already come to a conclusion as stated before that the application of the

Petitioner is misconceived in law, I am of the view that for the best interest of justice, it is

necessary to ascertain whether the Petitioner has presented a prima facie case at this

threshold stage, for this Court to issue notice on the Respondents based on the arguability

principles.

In this context, I now advert to examine the documents submitted on behalf of the 1st, 2nd

& 4th Respondents. I can summarize the contents of those letters, submitted by the 2nd

Respondent, pertaining to the issue in question of this application, as below.

1) The Director General of Department of National Botanic Gardens in response to

a request made by the Director, Environment and Social Development Division of

RDA (Road Development Authority), for an opinion with regard to removal of the

said Tree within the proposed right of way of the Central highway, has stated, by

way of a letter dated 20.08.2020 (marked X2') that such removal will not in any

way result in extinction of the said plant species. He has made an observation

therein that six plantlets have been raised successfully from an earlier exploration

from which 2 were planted at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Peradeniya.

2) The RDA through letter dated 18.09.2020 (marked X3), has requested permission

from the Department of Wildlife Conservation to remove the said Tree within the

right of way of the proposed Central highway on the strength of the opinion

expressed by the National Botanical Gardens, that such removal of the said Tree

will not harm the existence of the said plant species.

3) The Department of Wildlife Conservation through letter bearing the reference no.

/6/1/2/879 (marked X4) has expressed that they have no objections for

removing the said Tree subjected to the condition that the said Tree should be

planted in an appropriate place as prescribed therein.

4) The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) by letter dated 05.02.2021 (marked

X5) has indicated that its the responsibility of the RDA to adhere to the

recommendations of the relevant authorities when carrying out the removal of the

said Tree. Further, the CEA has requested the RDA to provide a detailed report on

the mechanism that would be adopted in removing the said Tree.

Page 8 of 10

5) As per the Report at X6, the expert team of Department of National Botanic

Gardens and the resource persons have been able to identify additional set of the

said Tree in other places such as Magalegoda, Doranagoda, Minuwangoda-

Handimahara, Biyagama, Kadirana, Malwana in the country.

6) The Director General of Department of Wildlife Conservation through letter dated

16.04.2021 (marked X7) has reiterated that there is no change in his position in

allowing the said Tree to be removed from the existing place and relocating it.

7) The X8 is the minutes of the virtual meeting of the Advisory Committee who

discussed on the relocation of the said Tree and the conservation measures, on

16.11.2021 via zoom.

In view of the foregoing, my attention drifts to the principles of sustainable development

which, in my view, is very much relevant to the issues of this application. It is a duty of

the Environmentalists to raise concerns to protect the environment whilst the rulers may

focus on the infrastructure development of a country. In any society, striking a balance by

the relevant stakeholders, between the economic development and the consequential

environment destructions is essential. The UNESCO claims that the Sustainable

development is the overarching paradigm of the United Nations. The concept of

sustainable development was described by the 1987 Brundtland Commission Report2 as

development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of

future generations to meet their own needs.3

In Essar Oil Ltd. vs. Halar Utkarsh Samiti and others, AIR (2004) SC 1834 (at p.1843 para

27), the Supreme Court of India referred to the Stockholm Declaration while elucidating

on the principle of sustainable development. Justice Ruma Pal, in this case observed;

This, therefore, is the aim - namely to balance economic and social needs on the one hand

with environmental considerations on the other. But in a sense all development is an

environmental threat. Indeed, the very existence of humanity and the rapid increase in the

population together with consequential demands to sustain the population has resulted in the

concreting of open lands, cutting down of forests, the filling up of lakes and pollution of water

resources and the very air which we breathe. However, there need not necessarily be a

2 A report of the World Commission on Environment and Development 3 https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-sustainable-development/what-is-esd/sd

Page 9 of 10

deadlock between development on the one hand and the environment on the other. The

objective of all laws on environment should be to create harmony between the two since

neither one can be sacrificed at the altar of the other. This view was also taken by this

Court in Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action vs. Union of India (1996) 5 SCC 281,

296 where it was said:

"while economic development should not be allowed to take place at the cost of ecology or by

causing wide spread environment destruction and violation, at the same time the necessity

to preserve ecology and environment should not hamper economic and other

developments. Both development and environment must go hand in hand, in other words,

there should not be development at the cost of environment and vice versa but there should

be development while taking due care and ensuring the protection of environment"

(Emphasis added)

Having considered the above principles of sustainable development, one may raise a

question whether this Court should grant an interim relief that the Petitioner has sought.

Irrespective of my earlier findings that the application of the Petitioner is misconceived in

law, I draw my attention to the submission made by the learned State Counsel who

contended that the balance of convenience would not lie in favour of the Petitioner. The

learned State Counsel brought to the attention of this Court the contents of the letter dated

17.12.2019 (marked X1) written by the Project Director of RDA on the issue of the said

Tree, wherein it is stated that changing the proposed right of way of the said highway

would cause socio-economic complications.

Upon a query maid by this Court, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner indicated that the

Petitioner had filed the instant application on the basis that the said Tree is an extremely

rare plant species and there is a risk of getting it destroyed. However, it has been

established by X2 and X6 that the said Tree is not the only plant species available in the

country and the RDA is taking measures to relocate the same. There is no contrary

argument raised by the Petitioner against the position reflected in the documentation filed

by the 2nd Respondent. Accordingly, there is no viable reason to disregard the measures

taken by the RDA to relocate the said Tree adopting a secured methodology in view of the

expert opinion expressed by;

i. Director General of Department of National Botanic Gardens

ii. Director General of Department of Wildlife Conservation

Page 10 of 10

iii. Director General of Central Environmental Authority

Therefore, I am convinced with the submissions made by the learned State Counsel based

on the tests applicable in issuing interim relief by this Court.

In the circumstances, I refuse the application for issuance of notice on the Respondents as

I am not satisfied that there is an arguable ground for judicial review which has a realistic

prospect of success. I am influenced by The Administrative Court Judicial Review Guide

20214 of England and Wales, where guidelines are laid down in order to refuse permission

at the threshold stage of a judicial review application.

Professor Johannes Chan of University of Hong Kong (Faculty of Law), in his article

Application For Leave For Judicial Review: A Practical Note published in Law Lectures

for Practitioners 1999 p.165 (at p.167) states that;

The test for granting leave is potential arguability, that is, whether the materials before the

trial judge disclose matters which might, on further consideration, demonstrate an arguable

case for the grant of the relief claimed5.

Application is dismissed.
