Argued On: 21.02.2022

Decided On: 22.03.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to set aside the orders of the High

Court dated 12.6.2020 and 23.12.2020 and to obtain bail for the second accused

petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner).

The contention of the petitioner is that he was arrested by the police on 21st of May

2015 in Tangalle and no alleged substance was found from his custody and he had

been in remand since then.

He further states that he has two pending cases similar in nature and while in

remand prison he had undergone a bypass surgery and as he is in remand he is

unable to go through the required health precautions necessary after a bypass

surgery.

The petitioner further stated that the two impugned orders by the High Court is

illegal and capricious for the reasons that,

1) It has declared him to be already guilty of the offence he has been indicted

for, 2) The High Court is of the erroneous understanding that a bail application can

be made only once, 3) That the High Court believes that the petitioner has to submit attractive

grounds for bail and not exceptional, which is in law is incorrect.

The respondents on the other hand have stated that the,

1) Petitioner committed the instant offence while being on bail for a similar offence,

2) Petitioner has two more pending cases which are similar in nature

3) That the petitioner if enlarged on bail is most likely to abscond as in one of the

other cases in which another accused has absconded after being enlarged on bail

4) The Court of appeal on a previous occasion has considered bail and has rejected

the same in considering the gravity of the offence in the year 2018.

According to the facts of the instant case the petitioner had been arrested by the

police on 25.5.2020 and had been produced before the Magistrate on a B report

stating that he had been arrested for offences under the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs act, and he had also been detained under the provisions of the

Prevention of Terrorism Act due to an alleged involvement of terrorist activities.

According to the provisions of the act under which the petitioner had been produced

section 83 states that no person suspected or accused of an offence under section

54 A and 54B shall be released on bail except by High Court in exceptional

circumstances

Page 4 of 5

The term exceptional has not been defined in the act but in many of the judgments

so far decided has defined the term exceptional, but in the case of Carder vs. OIC

Narcotics Bureau 2006 vol 3 74 has very lengthily gone in to analyzing as to what

had been defined as exceptional and it has cited six cases where the period in

remand has been considered to be exceptional and also has highlighted

othergrounds which had been considered as exceptional such as the,

1) Nature of the accusation,

2) The nature of the evidence,

3) The severity of the punishment if convicted.

The same judgment has held that in considering bail in an application of the instant

nature that Court should be mindful of the effects of the society at large, and the

law should not be made impotent that it does not serve the society and the

antisocial elements should not be given license to create havoc in society

The Counsel for the petitioner had submitted that when the petitioner was

arrested he had no illegal substance in his possession, the respondents also did not

dispute the fact but this Court is of the view that the facts of the case need not be

gone into at this stage, but this Court is very mindful of the gravity of the offence

with which the petitioner had been charged with and also of the fact that the

petitioner was arrested for the instant offence when he had been on bail for a

similar offence which is now pending.

The petitioner has further submitted that he had been in remand for nearly five

and half years, and it should be considered to be exceptional enough to grant bail.

But in the case of Attorney General vs. Letchchami SC Appeal 13/2006 it refers to

Page 5 of 5

usual delay in distinguishing delay that is common to all in remand prison due

administrative and other reasons and delay which is inordinate.

In the instant matter the petitioner has been accused of a quantity of heroin which

is quite large which can be termed as being for commercial purposes and he has

two pending cases of similar nature and the petitioner has been arrested for the

instant matter while being on bail for one of them, hence the five years in remand

although not very reasonable cannot be considered as being exceptional due to

the reasons aforesaid.

The petitioner has quoted his health condition as being exceptional, but this Court

notes that he has undergone the bypass surgery while being in remand very

successfully, hence directions can be given for him to be able to adhere to

whatever conditions those need to be done, inside the prison.

Hence for the reasons stated above this Court sees no exceptional ground to

enlarge the petitioner on bail.

Hence although this Court is unable to agree with the legal reasonings of the High

Court in the two impugned bail orders the instant application is dismissed for the

reason that the grounds urged by the petitioner as exceptional cannot be

considered so in view of the reasons stated above.

As such the instant application is dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
