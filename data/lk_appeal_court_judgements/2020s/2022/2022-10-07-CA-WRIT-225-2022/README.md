Respondents

Before :Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

Dhammika Ganepola J.

Counsel : Dharshana Weraduwage with Ushani Atapattu for the Petitioner.

Amsara Gajadeera, SC for the 4th, 20th to 24th Respondents.

Page 6 of 10

Supported on : 20.09.2022

Decided on : 07.10.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner draws the attention of this court to the archaeological

site located at Ramegala Maha Urulewa, Andiyagala area in the Palalagala Divisional

Secretariat division in the Anuradhapura District ('the Urulewa Site'). According to the

Petitioner, the Urulewa Site had been identified as an archaeological site as listed in the

"Archaeological Survey of Ceylon" Annual Report 1895, marked 'X3i' and 'X3j'. The learned

Counsel for the Petitioner states that on or around 09.01.2021, the Petitioner had noticed that

the Urulewa Site had been vandalized by an unknown group.

Therefore, the Petitioner on 10.01.2021 has written the email marked 'X4' informing the 2nd

Respondent of the destruction of archaeological sites by organized gangs and has requested

the 2nd Respondent to take steps to prevent such destruction. On 11.01.2021, the Petitioner

wrote the letter marked 'X5' to the 8th Respondent informing him of the same and offering to

lend the Petitioner's support in protecting such archaeological sites.

The Petitioner in the letter marked 'X6' dated 08.04.2021 has informed the 3rd Respondent of

the important archaeological sites located in the area and that a gang of thieves had been

vandalizing the sites acting on the myth that there was hidden treasure trove. Further, the

Petitioner claimed that the police officers and public officials were assisting the gangs hoping

to find treasure trove for themselves. Therefore, though the Galkiriyagama Police had

captured the main suspect of the Urulewa Site's destruction, the Petitioner alleges that the

Police had later set him free, stating that he escaped.

The Petitioner, inter alia, seeks for an order in the nature of a writ of Mandamus compelling

the 1st and 4th Respondents to take immediate steps to secure the archaeological sites as more

fully described in the Schedule to the Petition, by including them in a Gazette under the

Page 7 of 10

Antiquities Ordinance. An order in the nature of a writ of Mandamus is also being sought to

compel the 23rd Respondent to issue circulars and/or Orders under the Police Ordinance,

setting out the necessary instructions to secure the sites described in the schedule to the

Petition.

However, I must draw my attention to the 5th Respondent's letter dated 23.02.2021 addressed

to the 8th Respondent, marked 'X10', listing several sites of archaeological value, requesting

the 8th Respondent to take necessary steps to assist the 16th Respondent to survey and mark

the listed sites as archaeological reserves.

Further, the 4th Respondent's letter marked 'X9', dated 10.11.2021 informs the Petitioner of

the measures taken and to be taken in future to protect and conserve the archaeological sites

that the Petitioner raised concerns about. The Petition of the Petitioner illustrates that many

requests which were made for the protection and conservation of several archaeological sites

and that the relevant Respondents have responded to such requests by informing the

Petitioner of the measures that have and will be taken to that end.

For a writ of mandamus to be issued, the Court must be satisfied that a request to a public

authority was made to act in accordance with its statutory powers and such request was

unfairly, illegally and arbitrarily denied.

Sripavan J. stated in Mageswaran vs. University Grants Commission and Others (2003) 2

Sri L.R. 276 at p.285;

"A writ of mandamus only commands the person or body to whom it is directed to

perform a public duty imposed by law. In other words, a writ of mandamus would lie

where a statute requires certain action in defined circumstances and despite the

existence of such circumstances, the required action has not been performed."

However, in the instant case, I do not find any denial of the Petitioner's claims by the 4th & 5th

Respondents as those Respondents have taken action to execute their official duties in

pursuant to main concerns of the Petitioner. On a careful consideration of the events that had

taken place, I observe that the 4th & 5th Respondents have taken reasonable action to protect

and conserve the archaeological sites the Petitioner mentions in the Schedule to the Petition.

Page 8 of 10

It is important to note that the Petitioner is not seeking any order from Court to get the above

letters, marked X9 & X10 executed and also the Petitioner has not made any request or

application challenging or disputing the contents in X9.

This Court has consistently taken the view that the reasons in support of a Judgement in a

case must be cogent and succinct. Merely giving a sequence of evidence in the body of the

Petition is not sufficient as the judgement of this case finally focused on the prayer of the

Petition of the Petitioner. Mere characterization of a claim as a claim in public law is not

sufficient for consideration by the review Court.

Thus, I am not convinced that the Petitioner's illustration of the sequence of events would

establish cogent grounds for the exercise of this Court's discretion and this Court should not

intervene with any decision or action of the Respondents. In view of the foregoing, I take the

view that this is not a fit and proper case for the exercise of the jurisdiction of this Court to

issue a writ of mandamus.

In contrast to the above, the contents of the letter dated 17.10.2021, marked X7 should be

taken in to serious consideration. In the said letter, marked 'X7', the Petitioner requests the 4th

to 6th Respondents to protect and conserve certain archaeological sites in Urulewa &

Dambulla and volunteers to assist the Respondents to do so. In the letter marked 'X8', the

Petitioner states the same and further requests the 2nd Respondent to hand over the

abovementioned archaeological sites to the Petitioner to protect and conserve them.

The above stance taken by the Petitioner appears in both the said letters marked X7 and

X8;

The above assertions by the Petitioner clearly show that they are purportedly cultivating the

land adjoining to the subject archaeological sites. A reasonable doubt arises as to why the

Petitioner is extending its willingness to bear the cost of exploration of such archaeological

sites. Moreover, the Petitioner expresses its willingness to provide their own security to the

subject site, to which in my view, the Petitioner has no right whatsoever. No archaeological

site can be alienated to any private individual even to protect and provide security as it is the

prime duty of the Department of Archaeology and other government authorities.

The 4th Respondent's said letter marked 'X9' informs the Petitioner that according to the

Antiquities Ordinance No.9 of 1940, the managing of archaeological sites cannot be handed

over to organizations which have no prior experience in excavating or conserving such sites.

Section 6 of the said Antiquities Ordinance provides;

Subject as hereinafter provided, no person shall excavate for the purpose of discovering

antiquities, whether on land belonging to himself or otherwise, except under the

authority of a licence issued by the Director-General of Archaeology:

Provided that nothing in this section shall apply to any excavation carried out by or

on behalf of the Director-General of Archaeology.

Therefore, I take the view that the Petitioner's abovementioned unexplained request was

made without good conscience or clean hands. In light of the above, I use my discretion to

arrive at the conclusion that the Petitioner's request to hand over the responsibility of the

Urulewa site's protection and conservation to them, showed collateral purposes and an

attempt to illegally obtain undue advantages. I am of the view that unmeritorious and dilatory

challenges should not be entertained in judicial review.

Based on my above findings on collateral purposes and unclean hands of the Petitioner and

on a careful consideration of the whole matter including the manner in which the interim

orders prayed for in the prayer, I should exercise my discretion to direct 1st, 2nd, 4th to 14th

Page 10 of 10

Respondents not to alienate any State land in relation to the subject archaeological sites

through whatsoever manner without a policy decision being taken by the Cabinet of

Ministers.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the Petitioner has failed to come to this Court with

clean hands and has failed to submit a prima facie case which warrants this Court to issue

formal notices on the Respondents. This Court has consistently adopted the arguability

principle to decide on the issuance of notice on the Respondents and held that an arguable

ground for judicial review includes whether there is some properly arguable vitiating flaw

such as unlawfulness, unfairness or unreasonableness. (See-R vs. Chief Rabbi ex p. Wachmann

(1992) 1 WLR 1036 at 1037H and Prof. D.G. Harendra de Silva & others vs. Hon. Pavithra

Wanniarachchi Minister of Health & others, CA/Writ/422/2020 decided on 01.02.2022).

Application is refused.
