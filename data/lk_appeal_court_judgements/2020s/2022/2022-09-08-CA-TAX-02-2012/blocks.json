    "text": "However, it is important to observe that in Section 217 of the IR Act, the interpretation Section, the word person is defined to include a company as well. Moreover, I am of the view that the language in Section 3 of the IR Act does not suggest an interpretation as to if interest accrues to an individual, not in the course of a business, it is not profit of a business but, is part of his income and if the interest appertains to a company, it is profits of the business. The reason being, Section 3 (a) of the IR Act is not limited to the profits from any trade or business but includes the profits from any profession or vocation as well. A profession or vocation is obviously related to an individual. Therefore, it is obvious that application of Section 3 (a) of the IR Act cannot be limited to a business. Similarly, the dividends interest or discounts are not limited to an individual but could be in relation to a company as well. Accordingly, Section 3 (e) also could not be limited to an individual and should apply to a company as well. Hence, in my view the above submission of the Appellant is devoid of merit.",

Bradley11 (hereinafter referred to as the Nuclear Electric case). Both CGIR and TAC relied on the Nuclear Electric case in arriving at their determination. It is a case where the tax payer whose business was generating electricity has set aside part of his business proceeds as an investment to be utilized later as expenditure in the same business. The Court held that this course is not within the meaning of trading income and, investment income cannot be converted into trading income by simply setting up a segregated fund. It was further held that the test is to see whether the investment form an integral part of the business. The Appellants contention was that the English Courts have considered a different provision of the English statue which is not comparative to Section 3 of the IR Act. It is true that the provision considered in the Nuclear Electric case is Section 393 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act, 1988 of the United Kingdom where the term trading income was interpreted in Section 393 (8) itself. In the said case the issue was whether the income from the investments fell within the scope of that section to be considered as trading income.",
