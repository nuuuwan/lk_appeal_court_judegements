1st to 6th Respondents - 29.09.2022

Decided on : 26.10.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner is seeking, inter alia, to quash the decision (P5) of the 3rd Respondent to

interdict the Petitioner and to commence a preliminary investigation. The Petitioner is

also challenging the contents of the charge sheet (P10a) issued against her.

The Petitioner was serving as an Assistant Director (Planning) at the Urban Development

Authority, the 1st Respondent (UDA) during the time the Petitioner was interdicted. The

Petitioners services has been suspended by letter dated 09.03.2022, marked P5, on the

pretext of an allegation that the Petitioner had unduly accepted a sum of Rs.25,000.00

from two persons, namely Mrs. M.P. Sonali Peiris (Mrs. Peiris) and Mr. H. K. Nilusha

Padmendra (the husband of Mrs. Peiris) during office hours, within the office premises,

upon a matter which doesnt come within the purview of the Petitioner.

The defense taken up by the Petitioner in regard to such allegation is that she has never

requested such money and she has only given some tips to Mrs. Peiris who had come to

UDA with her husband to collect the preliminary planning clearance which had been

approved by UDA in respect of the property of Mrs. Peiris.

Preliminary objections.

The 1st to 6th Respondents (Respondents) assert that the application of the Petitioner

should be dismissed in limine solely on the following preliminary objections;

i. the Petitioner is guilty of laches;

ii. the reliefs sought by the Petitioner do not warrant this Court to exercise writ

jurisdiction as there are alternate and effective legal remedy available to the

Petitioner under the Industrial Disputes Act in respect of the alleged grievance;

iii. the relationship between the parties of this case is purely contractual and thus, no

writ of Certiorari/ Mandamus/ Prohibition would lie;

Page 4 of 13

iv. the relief sought by the Petitioner by way of a writ of Prohibition to prohibit the

Respondents conducting a preliminary investigation is futile as such preliminary

investigation has already been concluded. Based on the same grounds, no writ of

Certiorari can be issued to quash the decision to commence a preliminary

investigation.

Laches.

The Respondents assert that the Petitioner is guilty of laches. The Respondents relied on

the judgements of Rajakaruna vs. Minister of Finance, CA/Writ/2045/80 decided on

11.02.1985; Ratnayake vs. Jayasinghe (1975) 78 NLR 35; Issadeen vs. The Commissioner of

National Housing (2003) 2 Sri. L.R. 10; Gunasekara vs. Weerakoon 73 NLR 262; Sarath

Hulangamuwa vs. Siriwardane, Principal of Vishaka Vidyalaya and 5 others (1986) 1 Sri. L.R.

272 (at p. 273); Shums vs. Peoples Bank (1983) Sri. L.R. 197; President-Malalgoda Co-

operative Society vs. Arbitrator of Co-operative Society 51 NLR 167; Bisomenika vs. C. R. de

Alwis (1982) 1 SLR 368; Seneviratne vs. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and another (1999) 2 Sri.

L.R. 341.

When examining the dicta of all above cases, the principle well established is that the

Court in Judicial Review has the discretion to assess whether there is an undue delay and

also the Court can grant discretionary remedy if the impugned order or decision is

manifestly erroneous and issued without jurisdiction. I need to draw my attention to the

following paragraph in the case of Biso Menika vs. Cyril de Alwis and Others (1982) 1 SLR

368 (p. 379,380), a Judgement which was among those referred to by the learned Counsel

for the Respondents. Sharvananda J. has observed in that case;

"When the Court has examined the record and is satisfied the Order complained of is

manifestly erroneous or without jurisdiction the Court would be loathe to allow the mischief

of the Order to continue and reject the application simply on the ground of delay, unless there

are very extraordinary reasons to justify such rejection

Unlike in English Law or in our Law there is no statutory time limit within which a

petition for the issue of a Writ must be filed. But a rule of practice, has grown which insists

upon such petition being made without undue delay. When no time limit is specified for

Page 5 of 13

seekiing such remedy, the Court has ample power to condone delays, where denial of Writ to

the petitioner is likely to cause great injustice. "

The Petitioner has been interdicted on 09.03.2022 (P5) and the Petitioner has filed the

instant application on 15.06.2022. The Petitioner has come to this Court within 98 days

from the impugned interdiction. The Respondents themselves state that the Petitioner has

decided to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court after viewing the video footage and also

listening to the recordings of telephone conversations relating to the complaints against

the Petitioner. Hence, I use my discretion to arrive at a conclusion that there is no undue

delay on the part of the Petitioner to come to this Court and I overrule the preliminary

objection of the Respondents on laches.

Writ Jurisdiction vis-a-vis disputes arising out of Contract of Employment.

The Respondents strongly argue that this Court cannot exercise its Writ Jurisdiction as the

nature of the dispute in the instant application is based on a contract of employment

between the UDA and the Petitioner.

The Respondents heavily relied on the cases of Ranjith Upali Kumara Dissanayake vs. The

Peoples Bank and 15 others, CA/Writ/241/2018 decided on 12.11.2018; Jayawickrema vs.

NSB, CA/Writ/112/2016 decided on 18.11.2020; Gawarammana vs. Tea Research Board and

others (2003) 3 Sri. L.R. 120 (at p.122); U. L. Karunawathie vs. Peoples Bank and others,

CA/Writ/893/2010 decided on 11.05.2015; Piyasiri vs. Peoples Bank (1989) 2 Sri. L.R. 47;

A. R. A. Sathar vs. Peoples Bank, CA/Writ 195/2008 decided on 12.12.2012; K. S. De Silva

vs. National Water Supply and Drainage Board (1989) 2 Sri. L.R. 1; Rodrigo vs. The Municipal

Council, Galle & another 49 NLR 89; Premaratne vs. Peoples Bank and others (2004) 3 Sri. L.

R. 156; De Alwis vs. Silva 71 NLR 108; Galle Flour Milling (Pvt) Limited vs. Board of

Investment of Sri Lanka and another (2002) BLR 10; Jayaweera vs. Wijeratne (1985) 2 Sri.

L.R. 413; Weligama Multi Co-operative Society vs. Daluwatte (1984) 1 Sri. L.R. 195 (at

p.199); Lanka Marine Services (Pvt) Ltd. vs. Sri Lanka Ports Authority (2010) BLR 187

I have already dealt with this question in Devendra Budalge Sudesh Lalitha Perera vs.

Janatha Estates Development Board and others, CA/WRIT/004/2022 decided on 06.10.2022.

In line with the precedent laid down by several related judgements, the approach taken by

me with the concurrence of my brother judge in the said case was that this Court has the

discretionary power to exercise its writ jurisdiction even on a question arising out of a

Page 6 of 13

contract of employment if the disciplinary order of a public authority was in breach of

statutory restrictions/provisions and also if the employer has taken a decision assuming a

jurisdiction which he does not have or exceeding his jurisdiction by violating a statutory

requirement which eventually comes under any of the established grounds of judicial

review. In the said Devendra Budalge case this Court held;

The general perception is that the contractual and commercial obligations are

enforceable by ordinary actions and not by judicial review. However, with the

judicial activism within the realm of judicial review, our Courts as well as English

courts have deviated in many occasions from the above general rule. As such many

Judges have shown a tendency to favour the inclusion of contractual obligations in

judicial review in order to disallow administrative power to be escaped from

judicial control. The below mentioned passage in Kumudini Madugalle vs. National

Housing Development Authority, CA/Writ/540/2019 decided on 16.06.2020 is very

much apt here;

I must make clear this Judgement shall not be taken to mean that violations

based on contracts by public bodies are totally outside writ jurisdiction.

There is no such blanket prohibition. Each case shall be treated separately.

De Smith in his treatise1 at page 148 states The existence of a possibility of

a private law claim does not by itself however, make judicial review

inappropriate.

Moreover, it has been decided in R vs. British Coal Corporation ex parte Vardy (1993)

ICR 720 that if the dismissal was in breach of statutory restrictions, a quashing order

will lie to quash it. (Also see-Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth, (11th Edition)

Oxford at page 537).

The pivotal argument of the Petitioner in the instant application is that the Respondents

have acted in contrary to the provisions of the Establishment Code (E-Code). It is

observed as per the decision (R1) of the Board of Management of UDA that the Volume

II of E-Code regarding the disciplinary action in respect of its employees have been

adopted by the UDA.

1 De Smiths Judicial Review (8th Edition)

Page 7 of 13

I take the view that the said E-Code is deemed to be the current law regulating the

appointment, transfer, dismissal or disciplinary control of public officers. Similar

pronouncement has been made by the Supreme Court in Elmore Perera v. Major Montagu

Jayawickrema, Minister of Public Administration and Plantation Industries and Others 1985

1 Sri. L.R. 285 (at p. 335). The following dicta of the said case has been followed by the

Court of Appeal in Pathirana vs. Victor Perera, DIG-Personal Training Police (2006) 2 Sri.

L.R. 281;

"The Establishments Code is the basic document relating to procedures of disciplinary action

against public officers. It has been formulated by the Cabinet of Ministers under Article 55(4)

of the Constitution in whom such a power is reposed. This formulation has the characteristics

of a policy decision as it deals with the broad principles and procedures governing disciplinary

action against officers of practically the entire public service in this country

...The administration of the public service is now an internal matter of the Executive. It

would however appear that the Cabinet, after due deliberation, has sought to formulate a

Code of regulations containing fair procedures and safeguards balancing the requirements

and interests of the Government with the rights of public officers, and the legal protection now

provided by the law to public officers is contained in this Code. These procedures are therefore

mandatory and cannot be superseded or disregarded without due legal authority."

Therefore, I take the view that this Court need to examine whether the Respondents have

violated any statutory provisions when making a disciplinary order in reference to the

contract of employment. In light of the above, I reject the preliminary objection raised by

the Respondents on the jurisdiction of this Court.

Alternative Remedy.

The Respondents contend that the Petitioner has not exercised the effective and alternative

remedy available to her under the Industrial Disputes Act. However, it is observed that

the Respondents have failed to identify a particular remedy under the said Industrial

Disputes Act which would be available to the Petitioner at this juncture.

The Respondents have cited the below mentioned cases in view of establishing the fact

that this Court should refrain from granting reliefs in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari or

Page 8 of 13

a Writ of Prohibition when an effective and alternative remedy is available to the

Petitioner.

Obeysekera vs. Albert and others (1978-79) 2 Sri. L.R. 220; Ranaweera vs. Chairman

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and others (2005) 2 Sri. L.R. 192; Rodrigo vs. The

Municipal Council, Galle 49 NLR 89; Bhambra vs. Director of Customs and others

(2002) 3 Sri. L.R. 240; Rev. Maussagolle Dharmarakkitha Thero and another vs.

Registrar of Lands & others (2005) 3 Sri. L.R. 113; Hendrick Appuhamy vs. John

Appuhamy 69 NLR 32; Baldwin and Francis Ltd. vs. Patents Appeal Tribunal and

others (1958) 2 All ER 368 (CA)

I agree to a great extent on principle with the Respondents said argument based on the

dicta of the above judgements. But I am mindful of the fact that the Petitioners services

have not been formally terminated up to date for her to recourse to the Labour Tribunal

under section 31(B)(1) of the said Industrial Disputes Act. Perhaps, the Petitioner may

formulate a case in the Labour Tribunal on constructive termination and however, this

Court is unable to consider at this stage such option as an adequate and efficacious

alternative remedy available to the Petitioner based on the circumstances of this case.

The well-established principle is that the Judicial Review is available if the alternative

remedy is not adequate and efficacious. In E.S. Fernando vs. United Workers Union and

another 1989 2 Sri. L.R. 199, the Supreme Court has held that it is wrong to regard Section

20(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, which deals with the termination of an Arbitrators

award, as an alternative remedy in relation to proceedings for a writ of certiorari.

Taking all the circumstances of this case, I am not inclined to dismiss the instant

application of the Petitioner solely on the issue of the availability or non-availability of an

adequate and efficacious remedy for the Petitioner.

Interdiction E-Code.

The Petitioners argument is that in terms of the Clause 31:5:1 of the E-Code there is a

precondition which requires the UDA to consider evidence to the effect that the

continuance of Petitioner in service is detrimental to the holding of the preliminary

investigation against her.

Page 9 of 13

In terms of Clause 31:5:1 of Chapter XLVIII of the E- Code, the UDA may interdict an

officer even before holding a preliminary investigation where it is evident that the

continuance of the officer in service is detrimental to the holding of a preliminary

investigation.

The Clause 31 of the said chapter of the E-Code deals with Interdiction and Compulsory

Leave. The Clause 31:1 of the E-Code provides that where it is disclosed, prima facie,

that a public officer has committed either one or some or all of the acts of misconduct

mentioned in the said Clause, the relevant disciplinary authority may forthwith interdict

the officer concerned. Even a Head of the Department not holding disciplinary authority

also may forthwith interdict subject to the covering approval of the disciplinary authority.

It is important here to assess the strength of the word forthwith embodied in the said

Clause 31:1. In the case of Queen vs. The Justices of Berkshire [(1878-79) 4 Q.B.D. 469 (471)],

the meaning of "forthwith" has been discussed and the following passage therein, in my

view, is very much pertinent;

"The question is substantially one of fact. It is impossible to lay down any hard and fast rule

as to what is the meaning of the word 'immediately', in all cases. The words 'forthwith' and

'immediately' have the same meaning. They are stronger than the expression 'within a

reasonable time', and imply prompt, vigorous action, without any delay, and whether there

has been such action is question of fact, having regard to the circumstances of the particular

case".

In Soysa vs. Anglo-Ceylon and General Estates Co. (1916) 19 N. L. R. 374, Wood Renton C.J.

has held;

In my opinion the word " forthwith in the enactment in question should be construed as

meaning, not within a period reasonable in the circumstances, " but " without any delay that

can possibly be avoided. "

The provisions of Clause 31:4 of the E-Code disclose that a public officer should be

interdicted after a preliminary investigation but that is under normal circumstances. The

said Cluse 31:4 and also Clause 31:5 implies that an officer can be interdicted even before

a preliminary investigation. When analyzing the provisions in Clause 31:1:5, it appears

Page 10 of 13

that such provisions relate only to instances where the relevant authority interdict a public

officer before holding a preliminary investigation.

It is clear that when an officer is interdicted before a preliminary investigation, not only

the requirement in Clause 31:5:1 may be considered. The relevant authority may interdict

an officer without a preliminary investigation even considering the circumstances

stipulated in Clauses 31:5:2 and 31:5:3. Accordingly, if the relevant authority is of the view

that the first information itself on the suspected acts of misconduct committed by the

officer is sufficient to establish the relevant matters, then such officer can be interdicted

before a preliminary investigation.

The contention of the Respondents in this regard is that during the preliminary

investigations, the original 3rd party complainants have informed the officials of UDA that

the Police had visited their premises and warned them against participating in the ongoing

preliminary investigation. The Respondents highlight the fact that the Petitioners husband

is a Headquarters Inspector of Police and several other related aspersions are contained in

their Statement of Objections.

As per the contention of the Respondents, it is observed that they have considered the

video footage and recordings of telephone conversations at the time of taking the decision

to interdict the Petitioner. Moreover, it appears that the preliminary investigation against

the Petitioner has been concluded by the time of filing of this application and several

witnesses have also testified at the investigation.

Therefore, based on the above statutory regime established in the E-Code, I cannot agree

with the Petitioners arguments that there exists a pre-condition and also that the Petitioner

has been interdicted by the Respondents without fulfilling the requirements set out in

Clause 31:5:1 of the E-Code.

Charge Sheet E-Code.

The other main argument of the Petitioner is that the interdiction and the charge sheet is

bad in law as much as the said Mrs. Peiris is not a listed witness in the said charge sheet

and not even a statement of Mrs. Peiris has been listed therein. The Petitioner contends

that no formal complaint has been made by Mrs. Peiris or her husband against the

Petitioner.

Page 11 of 13

As opposed to such arguments, the 1st to 6th Respondents (Respondents) assert that the

decision to interdict the Portioner has been taken after assessing several evidence including

the video footage and the recordings of telephone conversations, which were viewed &

listened to by the Petitioner in the presence of the 6th Respondent. The UDA upon the

complaint made on 09.03.2022 by Mrs. Peiris and her husband in reference to the above

incident, has written a letter dated 15.03.2022 (P6a) to Mrs. Peiris to which Mrs. Peiris

has responded by way of a letter dated 22.03.2022 (P6b).

The Clauses 14:1 and 14:4 are important to be considered in regard to the point of view of

the Petitioner that Mrs. Pieris has not been listed as a witness in the Charge Sheet. In

terms of Clause 14:1, the charge need not take a legalistic form and however, it should be

a clear and simple statement or statements of any acts of misconduct or lapses committed

or believed to have been committed by the accused officer that call for a formal disciplinary

inquiry against him. A Disciplinary Authority, by virtue of Clause 14:4, may amend a

charge sheet at any time between its hand-over to the accused officer and the

commencement of the formal disciplinary inquiry.

I take the view that the effect of the above provisions of the E-Code vitiates the Petitioners

aforesaid argument and also such argument is premature.

Malice.

Additionally, the Petitioner has pleaded mala fides of the Respondents. Sripavan J. in

Bandaranayake vs. Judicial Service Commission (2003) 3 Sri. L.R. 101 has followed the

following contents in Principles of Administrative Law by Jain & Jain, 4th Edition 1988 (at

p. 564);

"The plea of mala fides is raised often but it is only rarely it can be substantiated to the

satisfaction of Court. Merely raising doubt is not enough. There should be something specific,

direct and precise to sustain the plea of mala fides. The burden of proving mala fides is on the

individual making allegation as the order is regular on its face and there is a presumption in

favour of the administration that it exercises its power in good faith and for the public benefit."

The alleged ill-treatment after the Petitioner filing a Fundamental Rights application and

also the purported allegations against the Respondents on bias cannot be considered, in

Page 12 of 13

my view, to sustain the plea of mala fides as those assertions in the Petition are limited

only to raising a doubt.

Whether the Respondents have taken a decision arbitrarily.

The Petitioners complain that the Respondents have taken a decision to interdict her

arbitrarily, unreasonably and without cause. Based on my conclusions arrived earlier on

the legal provisions of the E-Code in reference to the interdiction, I am of the view that

the Petitioner has failed to submit any decision taken by the Respondent which is arbitrary,

unreasonable and unjust as claimed by the Petitioner.

The Petitioner still has ample opportunity to challenge any decision of the Respondents

after the investigations (including the domestic inquiry) are over. The interdiction will not

be a presumption of guilt and it cannot be considered as a punishment. The interdiction is

one of the foremost processes used to initiate investigations in to allege misconducts.

In Jayaweera vs. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and Another (1996)

2 Sri. L.R. 70, in which F.N.D. Jayasuriya J. held;

"A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a writ of certiorari is not

entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine. Even if

he is entitled to relief, still the Court has a discretion to deny him having regard to his conduct,

delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction- are all valid impediments which stand

against the grant of relief"

The following passage in Kalamazoo Industries Ltd vs. Minister of Labour and Vocational

Training and Others (1998) 1 Sri. L.R. 235 is apt here. F.N.D. Jayasuriya J. in that case has

held;

Relief by way of certiorari in relation to an award made by an arbitrator will be forthcoming

to quash such an award only if the arbitrator wholly or in part assumes a jurisdiction which

he does not have or exceeds that which he has or acts contrary to principles of natural justice

or pronounces an award which is eminently irrational or unreasonable or is guilty of an

illegality." (Emphasis added).

Page 13 of 13

Conclusion.

For these reasons, I hold that the impugned decision (P5) of the 3rd Respondent to

interdict the Petitioner is not eminently irrational or unreasonable or is guilty of an

illegality. As to the impugned charge sheet (P10a), the Petitioner has failed to submit a

viable ground for review. It is ex-facie not apparent on the application of the Petitioner

that the Respondents who made the decision to interdict the Petitioner and to issue the

charge sheet have acted ultra vires or acted contrary to the rules of Natural Justice or have

not complied with mandatory provisions of law.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the Petitioner is not entitled to any of the reliefs

prayed for in the prayer of the Petition.

Application is dismissed. I order no costs.
