Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence of him by the

learned High Court Judge of Chilaw.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Chilaw on the following

counts:

1. For causing the death of Harabage Samantha Kumara on 08-08-2010 and

thereby committing the offence of murder, punishable in terms of section

296 of the Penal Code.

2. At the same transaction causing injury by use of a sharp cutting

instrument to Kandasami Dewadasa and thereby committing an offence

punishable in terms of 315 of the Penal Code.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw found the appellant guilty on

both the counts and he was sentenced to death with regard to the first count

and was sentenced to two-year rigorous imprisonment with regard to the second

count. He was also ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 7500/- and default he was

sentenced to 6 months simple imprisonment.

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel urged the following

two main grounds of appeal on behalf of the appellant.

1. There was no fair trial afforded to the appellant and hence, the conviction

and the sentence cannot stand.

2. The evidence placed before the Court clearly establishes the basis for a

conviction for culpable homicide not amounting to murder in terms of

exception 4 of Section 294 of the Penal Code on the basis of a sudden fight,

and therefore the conviction in terms of Section 296 of the Penal Code

cannot be sustained.

The main basis for the first ground of appeal urged by the learned Presidents

Counsel was that the Counsel who appeared for the appellant in the original

Court had no right to withdraw from the case, whilst leading evidence of the

appellant in his defence on the basis that the appellant was not giving

evidence as per his advice.

It was his contention that this action of the learned Counsel has led to a great

prejudice being caused to the appellant which amounts to no fair trial has

been afforded to him.

However, since this Court is of the view that considering the first ground of

appeal in detail would not be necessary, if the second ground of appeal urged,

namely, that the conviction should have been in terms of Section 294

exception 4, rather than Section 296 of the Penal Code has merit, the said

ground of appeal will be considered in preference to the first ground of appeal.

The facts placed before the High Court reveals that on the day of the incident

namely, 08-08-2010, there was an elle tournament at the Morakale ground

which was the place of the incident. After the tournament, at around 7:00

p.m. in the night, several of the participants, including the deceased, the

appellant, as well as the eyewitnesses were consuming liquor at the ground.

They have all been sitting when the incident has occurred.

Page 4 of 10

According to the evidence of PW-01 Kandasami Dewadas, who was also the

injured in the incident, while the consuming of liquor was going on, he has

suddenly seen the appellant attacking the deceased Samantha who was also

seated with them using what he thought was a club. In order to prevent the

attack, he has put his hand in between and received a cut injury as a result.

He has realized that it was not a club only because of the cut injury he has

received. He has seen the deceased being attacked several times by the

appellant. He was clear in his evidence that prior to the attack there was no

previous quarrel between them and they were singing and enjoying the

moment and the appellant was standing and the deceased was seated.

The evidence of all the other eyewitnesses was on the same line which clearly

suggests that there was no previous provocation and the incident was a result

of an unexplained sudden fight. It appears from the line of defence taken by

the Counsel who represented the appellant at the High Court trial was that

there was a fight between all of the persons who were present over the liquor

they consumed, and this incident occurred as a result.

He has not put forward a defence based on a sudden fight between the

appellant and the deceased. Which may be the reason why the Counsel who

represented the appellant at the trial decided to withdraw from the case when

the appellant gave evidence under oath in his defence.

The appellant giving evidence has admitted that it was he who caused the

injuries to the deceased. He has reasoned out by saying while they were

consuming liquor and having a party at the ground, there was a fight over a

liquor bottle and as a result the deceased tried to attack him and he got hold

of what he was being attacked and hit the deceased twice and ran away from

the scene.

It appears that his position before the learned Counsel who appeared for him

withdrew from the case had been that it was somebody else who had attacked

the deceased. It is therefore clear that the appellant has taken different stands

Page 5 of 10

at different points of the trial, which appears to be the reason for the learned

High Court Judge to reject his defence of sudden fight and finding him guilty

as charged.

It was the position of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) for the

respondent that although there is evidence to suggest that this was a result

of a sudden fight, he is supporting the conviction mainly based on the injuries

inflicted on the deceased by the appellant and the police investigations

relating to the incident and also the recovery of the murder weapon in terms

of Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance, about 150 feet away from the scene

of the crime.

It was contended by the learned DSG that according to the medical evidence,

there were 18 injuries inflicted on the deceased and injuries number 2 to 7

have been necessarily fatal cut injuries. All the injuries were on the rear side

of the body and evidence clearly establishes the fact that the deceased was in

a seated position when the attack occurred. It was his stand that since the

appellant has not put forward any defence on the basis of a sudden fight, the

witnesses called on behalf of the prosecution had not been afforded an

opportunity of explaining such a stand and therefore, it was correct for the

learned High Court Judge to reject the appellants stand taken only when he

was giving evidence in his defence.

He brought to the notice of the Court the necessity of putting forward any

defence taken up by an accused person when the relevant witnesses were

giving evidence. It was his view that the conviction and the sentence need not

be disturbed as the learned High Court Judge has reached his conclusions

correctly and having considered the evidence placed before the Court in its

correct perspective.

Having considered the submissions made by the learned Presidents Counsel

on behalf of the appellant, as well as the learned DSG on behalf of the

respondent, this Court is of the view that the evidence placed before the High

Page 6 of 10

Court has clearly established that it was the appellant who caused the fatal

injuries resulted in the death of the deceased. Hence, the question that needs

to be determined by this Court is that whether the incident amounts to

murder, punishable in terms of Section 296 of the Penal Code as determined

by the learned High Court Judge and supported by the learned DSG, or

whether the incident amounts to culpable homicide not amounting to murder

in terms of Section 294 exception 4 of the Penal Code, punishable in terms of

section 297 of the Penal Code.

Exception 4 of Section 294 of the Penal Code reads as follows:

Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden

quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or

acted in a cruel and unusual manner.

Explanation:

It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or

commit the first assault.

It is clear from the evidence adduced before the Court; the appellant has failed

to raise a defence based on a sudden fight in terms of exception 4 of Section 294

of the Penal Code until he raised that defence when he was giving evidence under

oath.

However, it is settled law that there is a duty cast upon a trial judge to consider

whether there was evidence before the Court for such an exception to be

considered, even if no such defence has been taken.

In the case of King Vs. Belana Withanage Eddin 41 NLLR 345, the Court of

Criminal Appeal held:

In a charge of murder, it is the duty of the judge to put to the jury, the

alternative of finding the accused guilty of culpable homicide not amounting

Page 7 of 10

to murder when there is any basis for such a finding in the evidence of

record, although such defence was not raised nor relied upon by the

accused.

In the case of King Vs. Vidanalage Lanty 42 NLLR 317, the Court of Criminal

Appeal observed the following;

There was evidence in this case upon which it was open to the jury to say

it came within exception 4 of Section 294 of the Penal Code and that the

appellant was guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder,

however no such plea was put forward in his behalf. In the course of his

address the presiding judge referred to this evidence as part of the defence

story, but not as evidence upon which a lesser verdict might possible.

held:

It was the duty of the presiding judge to so direct the jury that under the

circumstances, the appellant was entitled to have the benefit of a lesser

offence

In the appeal under consideration, the evidence led by the prosecution in itself

clearly shows that there was no premeditation and it was a sudden fight and in

the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel. The evidence shows that the

deceased, the appellant, as well as the other eye witnesses were enjoying their

day, while consuming liquor when this incident happened suddenly. There was

no evidence whatsoever of any premeditation by the appellant. There was no

evidence to show that the appellant went searching for a weapon as a result of

the sudden fight, but assaulted the deceased from a sharp cutting weapon that

was available within his reach. This shows that the offender has not taken undue

advantage of the situation. It is also evident that, all the persons present at the

time of the incident were under the influence of liquor.

I am unable to agree with the contention of the learned DSG that there is no

basis to consider the incident where the death of the deceased occurred, in terms

Page 8 of 10

of Section 297 of the Penal Code, although he agrees that the incident has

happened as a result of a sudden fight. Justifying his position, it was his

contention that the medical evidence shows 18 injuries to the deceased out of

which injuries 2 to 7 are necessarily fatal cut injuries and also the fact that the

deceased had been attacked from behind.

He further points out that the medical evidence shows the injuries have been

inflicted by using excessive force where it should have not been the case if it was

a sudden fight happened at the spur of the moment. Hence, the clear intention

of the appellant to kill the deceased has been established.

As I have discussed before, the evidence of the prosecution witnesses itself shows

that the deceased and the appellant had no previous enmity between them,

although the appellant in his evidence has stated that the deceased was in the

habit of demanding ransoms during the weekend in the form of liquor and

cigarettes.

The evidence shows that on the day of the incident, they were consuming liquor

and enjoying. There is no evidence to show any premeditation by the appellant

to attack the deceased. The only conclusion that can be reached under the

circumstances is that the incident was a result of a sudden quarrel and the

attack has been a result of the heat of passion.

There is no evidence to show that the appellant took undue advantage as

evidence shows that he took something that was available in the vicinity and

attacked the deceased, although there was no evidence as to who brought the

sharp cutting weapon to the place where they were consuming liquor.

It is correct that the deceased has received 18 injuries to his body, but that in

itself is not a reason to conclude that the appellant acted in a cruel or unusual

manner. It is quite possible for a person to keep on attacking another due to a

sudden emotion or passion that arises between the attacker and the attacked.

Page 9 of 10

The position of the learned DSG that the appellant clearly had the intention of

causing death when he attacked the deceased and therefore, his actions amount

to an act of causing murder is concerned, I find that the provisions of Section

297 provide for situations of causing death with intention or causing such bodily

injury as is likely to cause death or causing death by an act without any intention

to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.

Section 297 provides for different levels of punishment depending on the

intention and knowledge. I am of the view that the learned High Court Judges

rejection of the evidence of the appellant on the basis that such a ground of

sudden fight was not taken when the prosecution witnesses gave their evidence

was a misdirection. As discussed above, I am of the view that the evidence of the

prosecution witnesses itself has established that this was culpable homicide not

amounting to murder.

If the learned High Court Judge looked at the evidence in its totality, as he should

have been, it is my considered view that the conviction should have been in terms

of Section 297 of the Penal Code. Therefore, I hold that the conviction and the

sentence on the first count preferred against the appellant cannot be allowed to

stand, and hence, the conviction and the sentence on the 1st count is hereby set

aside.

I hold that the appellant is guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder

in terms of exception 4 of Section 294 of the Penal Code on the basis of a sudden

fight, punishable in terms of section 297 of the Penal Code, and find him guilty

on that basis on count 01.

Accordingly, I sentence the appellant for a term of 10 years rigorous

imprisonment and for a fine of Rs. 25000/-. In default he shall serve an

additional period of one-year simple imprisonment.

However, the sentence imposed on the appellant for the second count preferred

against him shall remain the same.

Page 10 of 10

Considering the fact that the accused has been in incarceration from the date of

the sentence, the sentence is ordered to be effective from the date of the sentence,

namely, 27-09-2017.

In view of the above determination, this Court is of the view that considering the

first ground of appeal urged in detail would not be necessary.

Appeal allowed to the above extent.
