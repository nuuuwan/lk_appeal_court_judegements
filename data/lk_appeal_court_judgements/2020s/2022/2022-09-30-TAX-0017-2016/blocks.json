The issue before us is not whether or not the income or profit generated from one source of income can be characterized in the nature of trade or business. The first issue before use is whether or not, when the business consists in the category of several profits or income, it is a part and parcel of the main business generated from the source of income stipulated in section 3(1)(a). The second issue before use is whether or not, when the business consists in the category of several profits or income, it is a separate category of income generated from any other source of income stipulated in section 3(1)(j) of the Inland Revenue Act.",

The CFI case related to the receipts of interest and dividends, and the subject matter of the present case, related to commission income. However, in my view the test used by Howard CJ., and Keuneman, J. (with Wijewardene, J. agreed) equally applies to decide the question whether the commission income claimed by the Appellant can be regarded as a profits and income from trade or business falling under section 3(1)(a) or any other source stipulated in section 3(1)(j) of the Act. In the circumstance, I am inclined to agree with the test applied by Howard CJ., and Keuneman, J. (with Wijewardene, J. agreed) in determining whether the profits and income received by the Appellant from commission falls under section 3(1)(a) or 3(1)(j) of the Inland Revenue Act.",
