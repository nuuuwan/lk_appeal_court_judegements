Even though, the Petitioner, before the Wakf Tribunal in case No. WT 220/2014, agreed to hand over the vacant possession of the subject matter to the Trustees, he failed to do so. Hence, the Respondents instituted proceedings before the Wakf Tribunal to obtain possession of the Trust property from the Petitioner. It is to be noted that, in terms of section 9E (3) of the Wakf Act, the Respondents have obtained certificate (sanction) from the Director1 to institute proceedings in the Wakf Tribunal. In this scenario, it appears that the property in dispute is governed by the provisions of the Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs Act.",
