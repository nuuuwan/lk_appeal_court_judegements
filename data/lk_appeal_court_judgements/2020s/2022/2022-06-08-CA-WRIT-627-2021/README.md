Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner of this application, on or around 04.08.2019 participated in a live talk show

by the name of Inside Sports hosted by Sirasa TV in which she has alleged to have

enumerated several false information with regard to the administration of the Sri Lanka

Hockey Federation (SLHF). As a result of such alleged expression of false information,

the Petitioner was temporary suspended from her membership of the SLHF from

21.08.2019 (as depicted in letter marked as P11). Thereafter, on or about 20.10.2019, the

Petitioner has been served with a charge sheet marked P17 for violating Section 27(d) of

the Constitution of the SLHF. Subsequently, the Petitioner was called for an inquiry and

following such inquiry, the 14th to 16th Respondents have determined that the Petitioner

was in violation of the said Section 27 (d) of the Constitution of SLHF.

In response to an appeal made by one Surein Wijeratne (who also participated in the above

programme) to the then Minster of Sports (for which the Petitioner was not a parry), the

SLHF has received a letter on or around 08.01.2020, from the Director General of Sports

Development marked as P19 directing that the suspension of the membership of the

Petitioner, Surein Wijeratne and Diluka Weerasekara be limited to a period of six months.

Consequent to the said events, by way of a decision of the 11th to 13th Respondents dated

08.04.2021 marked as P29, the nominations of the Petitioner for the posts of President

and Vice President for the election year 2021 were rejected and following were articulated

as the reasons for such rejection;

i. The certificates attached in support of the Petitioners application did not meet

the accepted criteria for the purpose of nomination;

ii. The letter dated 08.01.2020 marked as P19 contains a decision to reduce the

suspension of the membership of the Petitioner for a period of 06 months;

Page 4 of 8

iii. The Petitioner has not fulfilled the required qualifications stipulated in the

Constitution of National Association of Sports published in the Extraordinary

Gazette Notification No. 1990/23 dated 27.10.2016.

Thereafter, on or around 02.11.2021, SLHF has held the Election for the year 2021 and

the 1st to 9th Respondents were elected as the office bearers as stated in document marked

P40.

Subsequently, the Petitioner has filed the instant application seeking writs in the nature of

Certiorari;

i. to quash the charge sheet dated 20.10.2018 marked as P17;

ii. to quash the purported direction dated 08.01.2020 marked as P19;

iii. to quash the purported determination of the 11th to 13th Respondents rejecting

the Petitioners nomination contained in letter dated 21.04.2021 marked as P33

iv. to quash the purported determination of the 14th to 16th Respondents dated

07.11.2021 marked as P34(b);

v. to quash the purported determination of the 10th Respondent dated 25.10.2021

marked P39;

vi. to quash the purported election of the 1st to 5th Respondents as office bearers of

the SLHF at the recently concluded election on the 02.11.2021 as manifested by

P40.

Additionally, the Petitioner seeks for a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus

directing the 17th Respondent to act in terms of the Sports Law (Sports Law, No. 25 of

1973) and appoint an Interim Committee to look into and rectify the affairs, management

and demonstration of the SLHF.

All the Respondents raised preliminary objections on the basis that (i) the Petitioners

application is ex facie futile, frivolous and vexatious; and (b) the Petitioner is guilty of

laches or unexplained delay in presenting the instant application and accordingly, the

Respondents moved that the application of the Petitioner be dismissed in limine.

The Respondents state that upon a charge sheet being served for violating Section 27(d) of

the Constitution of the SLHF, the Petitioner was called for an inquiry to present her case

whereby the Petitioner has participated in such inquiries with her Attorney-at-law and has

Page 5 of 8

submitted statements of defence in writing. Therefore, the Respondents submit that due

process has been followed by the Respondents before taking disciplinary action against the

Petitioner.

As per paragraph 13 of the Petition, the Petitioner admits to the fact that she received the

charge sheet marked P17 and further states at paragraph 14 that she attended an inquiry

pertaining to the said charge sheet on the 27.10.2019. The Petitioner has filed the instant

application in this Court on 10.12.2021, just over a period of two years of issuing the said

charge sheet. However, the Petitioner has failed to adduce any reasons as to why she has

not challenged the said charge sheet before participating at the inquiry process.

Further, in paragraph 16 of the Petition, the Petitioner admits to receiving the direction

dated 08.01.2020 marked as P19 on or around January 2019, but once again has failed

to explain the delay in challenging such decisions.

Moreover, the Respondents submit that the Petitioner was aware of the determination

dated 07.11.2019 (issued by the 14th to 16th Respondents) marked P34(b) by the

25.04.2021, as such was mentioned in paragraph 35 of the Petition. The Respondents

further states that though such was mentioned in the Petition, the Petitioner has not

provided any reasoning as to why she had failed to challenge even the Inquiry report

marked along with P34(b) until the instant application was filed on 10.12.2021.

Therefore, now it is important to examine as to whether such conduct of the Petitioner

and the delayed application for judicial review is reasonable. In Judicial Remedies &

Public Law (4th ed.) at para. 9-17, Lewis states as follows;

"The claimant should challenge the decision which brings about the legal situation of which

complaint is made. There are occasions when a claimant does not challenge that decision but

waits until some consequential or ancillary decision is taken and then challenges that later

decision on the ground that the earlier decision is unlawful. If the substance of the dispute

relates to the lawfulness of that earlier decision and if it is that earlier decision which is, in

reality, determinative of the legal position and the later decision does not, in fact, produce any

change in the legal position, then the courts may rule that the time-limit runs from that earlier

decision."

As I have discussed in my judgement K.G.D Walter Abeysundera and another vs. Mr.

S. Hettiarachchi, Secretary, Ministry of Tourism and other, CA/Writ/371/2021

(decided on 22.09.2021), I am of the view that in instances where the impugned action

takes place in stages, the challenge should be launched against the earliest stage rather than

the final and decisive stage1.

In the circumstances, when analyzing the reliefs prayed for by the Petitioners, it is my view

that the Petitioner's conduct, particularly the acquiescence in the inquiry procedure should

be taken into consideration. The Petitioner, without recoursing to this Court by way of a

judicial review application against the said charge sheet at the initial stage, has participated

in the other stages of the inquiry and accordingly, has waited until she got an unfavourable

decision following the inquiry. In juridical review, the Court is concerned with the legality

of a decision and also whether it is lawful or unlawful. Accordingly, the said conduct of

the Petitioner, in my view, has intensified the delay to apply to this Court at the first

instance. Further the Petitioner has failed to furnish any justifiable explanation for her

delay in challenging the documents marked P17 dated 20.10.2019, P19 dated

08.01.2020 and P34(b) dated 07.11.2019. Therefore, in my view, the Petitioner is guilty

of laches and has failed to explain the delay in challenging the preliminary stages of the

inquiry including the charge sheet marked P17.

Now, I advert to examine whether the Petitioner has submitted a prima facie case

irrespective of the fact that she is guilty of laches as I have explained above.

By virtue of the letter dated 21.08.2019 marked P11, the Petitioner has been suspended

from her membership of the SLHF from 21.08.2019. The Petitioner pleads that at the time

the nominations for the Election were called on or about 15.03.2021, the Petitioner was

under the impression that the ban on her membership had been set aside and that there

would be no further action taken against her by any authority.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st, 3rd, 6th and 7th Respondents and the learned

Additional Solicitor General (ASG) for the 10th to 17th Respondents assert that the

1 See R vs Secretary of State for Trade and Industry ex p. Greenpeace [1998] COD 59 and R (Burkett) vs.

Hammersmith & Fulham LWC [2002] 1 WLR 1593 (HL)

Page 7 of 8

Election Committee of the SLHF rejected the Petitioners nominations in terms of the

Regulations 5(4)(p) made by the Minster by Extraordinary Gazette bearing No. 1990/23

dated 27.10.2016. The said Regulation 5(4) reads as follows;

5(4) A person shall be disqualified from being elected or otherwise to hold or

continue to hold any paid or unpaid office or to hold any paid or unpaid post or to

be a member of a Committee of any National Association of Sports or to be

nominee of an affiliated club or organization in a National Association of Sports,

if:-

(p) he is either serving a ban, suspension or prohibition imposed by the

decision making body of such National Association of Sports or a

competent body established by such National Association of Sports or by

the International Sports Organization to which is affiliated or a period of

two years have not lapsed after serving such ban, suspension or

prohibition on the date of submission of nominations. (Emphasis added)

The contention of the learned Counsel for the said Respondents is that the Petitioner has

submitted the nominations for the 2021 election (on 31.03.2021) before lapsing of a period

of two years since her suspension (21.08.2019) from membership and therefore, the

Petitioner is not eligible to contest for the said election.

If proper attention is paid to the said regulation 5(4)(p) of the Extraordinary Gazette

bearing No. 1990/23 dated 27.10.2016, it is apparent that an individual is disqualified

from being elected until a period of two years have lapsed after serving such ban,

suspension or prohibition on the date of submission of nomination. Therefore, in my view,

the commencement of such two-year period in respect of the Petitioner should be

enumerated not from 21.08.2019 (date of suspension) but from 21.02.2020 (the date after

serving the suspension for a period of six months).

Therefore, I am of the view that a period of two years has not lapsed by the time the

Petitioner submitted her nominations and thereby rejecting her nominations by the

Elections Committee is lawful.

The Regulation 8 of the National Association of Sports Regulations No. 01 of 2016 (as

amended by the Regulations contained in Extraordinary Gazette Notification No.

Page 8 of 8

2207/07 dated 23.12.2020) indicates that an appeal against a decision or action of a

National Association of Sports must be made in writing to the Minster within 7 days of

the receipt of such decision. The learned ASG asserts that as per paragraph 34 of the

Petition, it is evinced that the Petitioner was possessed with the decision of the National

Association of Sports on the rejection of the Petitioners nominations for the Election by

21.04.2021. However, she has appealed to such decision only on 11.05.2021 (see-P36),

that is almost two weeks after the said decision. Hence, the learned ASG submits that the

said Appeal, P36 was clearly made out of time in violation of the mandatory time period

prescribed by the regulations.

In the above backdrop, I see no reason to grant any relief to the Petitioner in reference to

P17, P19, P33, P34(b), P39 & P40 as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition. In

addition to the mandates in the nature of writs of Certiorari sought by the Petitioner in the

instant application, a writ of Quo Warranto is also being sought. I take the view that the

nature of formulating the said relief as per in paragraph (d) of the prayer of the Petition is

misconceived in law. Further, I take the view that the relief for a mandate in the nature of

Mandamus as prayed for in the paragraph (e) of the prayer of the Petition is beyond the

scope of the contents in the body of the Petition.

Thus, based on the arguability principles that should be adopted in respect of matters

relating to issuance of notice in a judicial review application, I arrive at the conclusion,

that there is no arguable case or a prima facie case for this Court to issue formal notice on

the Respondents of this application. Therefore, I proceed to refuse this application.
