Argued on : 15.11.2021

Decided on : 26.01.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The 1st Petitioner is the President of the Medical Administrators Forum which represents

the medical administrators inclusive of Board-Certified specialists in medical

administration. The Petitioners state that the Health (Medical) Service in Sri Lanka

comprises, inter alia, (i) Grade Medical Officers. (ii) Specialists Grade Officers and (iii)

Page 4 of 10

Administrative Grade Medical Officers. There are three Grades in the category of

Administrative Medical Officers, namely, (a) Deputy Medical Administrative Grade, (b)

Senior Medical Administrative Grade and (c) Deputy Medical Director Grade.

This application concerns appointments to the Deputy Medical Administrative Grade

which is the entry level Grade for the Administrative Grade Medical Officers. The

Petitioners plead that it is fit and proper and most appropriate that the posts in the medical

administrative service should be filled with those who possess Post Graduate qualifications

in medical administration, complying with the service minute applicable to the Health

(Medical) Services.

The contents of paragraph 17 of the Petition of the Petitioners which have been admitted

by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents, are as follows;

However, after a long process, including several expert committee reports and two Cabinet

sub-committees, a Cabinet decision was taken on 12th June 2018 to, inter alia, grant priority

to medical officers with post graduate qualifications in medical administration when

appointing officers to all posts except certain post identified separately, for which officers with

post graduate qualifications in community medicine would be granted priority

The original Health (Medical) Service Minute has been published in Extraordinary

Gazette Notification No. 1883/17 dated 11.10.2014, marked X. The Public Service

Commission has subsequently amended the said Service Minute and such amendments

were published in the Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 2218/50 dated 09.03.2021,

marked 1R7(b).

The Petitioners complaint is that not withstanding the publication of the amendments to

the said Service Minute, no steps have been taken to fill the existing vacancies in the

Deputy Medical Administrative Grade. The Petitioners contention is that there are

approximately 70 vacancies that have currently been left unfilled and it is essential for the

medical system, especially in the present circumstances, that the said positions are not left

vacant and are filled. Further, the Petitioners state that the appointments have not been

made to several posts in Community Medicine because of the practice of absorbing

medical officers with qualifications in community medicine in to the Medical

Administrative Grades. Petitioners contend that it is obligatory that the positions be filled

in terms of the Health (Medical) Service Minute (as amended) and that due to political

Page 5 of 10

and trade union pressure, steps may be taken by the 1st to 3rd Respondents to fill the said

vacancies otherwise than in terms of and/or in contravention of the said Service Minute

as amended. Accordingly, the Petitioners seek inter alia;

a) A mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to fill

the vacant posts in the Deputy Medical Administrative Grade of the Health

(Medical) Service under an in terms of the Health (Medical) Service Minute as

amended by the Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 2218/50 dated

09.03.2021; and

b) A mandate in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the Respondents from

taking any steps to fill vacant posts in the Deputy Medical Administrative Grade

of the Health (Medical) Service otherwise than in terms of the Health Medical

Service Minute, as amended by the Extraordinary Gazette Notification No.

2218/50 dated 09.03.2021.

It has been brought to the notice of this Court that several doctors with qualifications in

community medicine have instituted an application bearing No. SC/FR 153/2018 in the

Supreme Court seeking inter alia, to prevent implementation of the decision to give

priority in the Deputy Medical Administrative Grade to medical officers with

qualifications in medical administration. It was submitted that the President and the

Secretary of the College of the Medical Administrators of Sri Lanka have sought to

intervene in the said case and the matter has not been supported for leave to proceed (vide-

paragraph 42 to 46 of the Petition of the Petitioners).

The issues in respect of this application begin by submitting a Cabinet Memorandum dated

28.06.2021, marked 1R8 by the former Minister of Health who sought approval to;

i. temporarily suspend the implementation of the amended provisions included

in the Gazette Notification bearing No. 2218/50 published on 09.03.2021; and

ii. inform the Public Service Commission within two months, the

recommendations for solution through making a new policy appointing a

committee to study the existing Medical Service Minute with new

recommendations in order to give an appropriate solution for the existing issues

in Medical Administrative Grade.

Page 6 of 10

The Respondents contention is that such Cabinet Memorandum has been submitted due

to the continued representations made to the Minister of Health on the basis that the

aforesaid amendments to the Service Minute would result in discrepancies. The Cabinet

of Ministers as specified in the Cabinet decision dated 12.07.2021 granted approval to both

above recommendations in the said Cabinet Memorandum.

The Respondents state that in view of the aforesaid cabinet decision, the Respondents are

not in a position to proceed with the amended provisions of the Medical Service Minute.

The Respondents further state that the above 1st recommendation contained in 1R8 is only

a temporary measure employed with the intention to find a more sustainable solution to

the grievances of the stakeholders.

Therefore, the question that has to be examined here is whether the said Cabinet decision

dated 12.07.2021 is a barrier for the 2nd and 3rd Respondents to make appointments to the

Deputy Medical Administrative Grade in terms of the amended provisions of the Medical

Service Minute marked 1R7(b). In view of resolving the above question, the material

documents to be considered are the said Cabinet Memorandum dated 28.06.2021 (1R8),

the Cabinet Decision dated 12.07.2021 (1R9) and the Health (Medical) Service Minute

(X) including its amendments in 1R7(b).

By virtue of Article 55 (3) of the Constitution of the Republic, the appointment, promotion,

transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of public officers shall be vested in the Public

Service Commission (PSC) subject to the provisions of the Constitution. The Section 2 of

Chapter II of the Establishments Code deals with scheme of recruitment and accordingly,

for every post in the public service or where such a post belongs to a Grade or Service, for

every such Grade or Service, there should be a scheme of recruitment which specifies the

salary scale of post, the qualifications required, age limits and other relevant particulars.

The Medical Service Minute of Sri Lankan Health Service (hereinafter referred to as

Service Minute) published in Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 1883/17 on

11.10.2014 (X) by the PSC is basically a scheme of recruitment as contemplated by the

said Section 2 of the Establishments Code. The Clause 2 of the said Service Minute

stipulates that the PSC is the appointing authority in respect of all the posts other than the

post of the Director General of Health Services. Therefore, PSC and the Ministry of Health

are bound to make appointments to such posts including to the Deputy Medical

Page 7 of 10

Administrative Grade only in terms of and within the scheme set out in the Service Minute

marked X (as amended) issued by the PSC.

As observed above, the said Service Minute marked X has been amended by the PSC by

virtue of the Gazette Notification No. 2218/50 dated 09.03.2021, marked 1R7(b). Now,

it is important to ascertain as to whether those amendments introduced by the Gazette

Notification marked 1R7(b) is still in operation in the backdrop of the above decision taken

by the Cabinet on 12.07.2021. The Petitioners argument is that the said Cabinet decision

is only a conditional decision and in fact it cannot be considered as a proper Cabinet

decision. Further, the Petitioners argue that the said Service Minute or the amendments

in 1R7(b) have not been rescinded by the Cabinet or the PSC. In response to the said

argument, the 2nd and 3rd Respondents assert that this Court in determining this application

cannot disregard a Cabinet decision. However, as mentioned above the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents in paragraph 3 (j) of their Statement of Objections categorically averse that

the Respondents are not in a position to act according to the said amended Service Minute

due to the said Cabinet decision marked 1R9.

On perusal of the said Cabinet decision marked 1R9, it is apparent that such approval has

been granted, subjected to the condition that the Secretary to the Ministry of Health taking

actions as follows;

i. to ensure that there is no legal impediment pertaining to the implementation of the

above 1st recommendation;

ii. to obtain the concurrence of the Public Service Commission prior to implementing

the recommendation in the Memorandum.

Therefore, in my view, the 1st recommendation in the said Cabinet Memorandum to

temporarily suspend the implementation of the amended Service Minute 1R7(b) has been

approved by the Cabinet subjected to a precondition but not to a postcondition. Hence,

the temporary suspension approved by the Cabinet will become operative only upon the

concurrence being granted in that regard by the PSC and also upon the Secretary to the

Ministry of Health expressing an assurance that there is no legal impediment pertaining to

the aforesaid 1st recommendation. The 1st to 3rd Respondents have not indicated to Court

by way of their Statement of Objections or through the submissions made on their behalf

Page 8 of 10

at the argument stage that such concurrence of the PSC or an assurance of the said

Secretary had been issued.

On that footing, I am of the view that the said amendments made to the Service Minute

in 1R7(b) are still in force as the suspension approved by the Cabinet has not become

operative due to non fulfilment of the conditions imposed by the Cabinet.

Also, the Court observes that there is no direction issued on the 2nd and 3rd Respondents

by the Cabinet and that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents are bound only by a decision of the

PSC made in reference to the said Service Minute, by virtue of the delegated powers under

the Constitution.

The Petitioners rely upon the judgement of K.W.S.P Jayawardhana and 24 others vs.

Gotabaya Jayaratne, Secretary Ministry of Education and others SC FR Application

No. 338/2012 decided on 07.09.2018, in which Prasanna Jayawardena J. has held that;

Before parting with this issue, it is relevant to state that, at times material to this application,

the powers vested in the Cabinet of Ministers by Article 55 (1) of the Constitution to provide

for and determine policy relating to the appointment and promotion of public officers,

authorise the Cabinet of Ministers to direct that a Service Minute be amended or scrapped

altogether and replaced with another or to direct that a specific procedure be adopted to meet

the needs of specific circumstances, which are outside the compass of a Service Minute or are

not met by the provisions of a Service Minute. In HETTIARACHCHI vs. SENEVIRATNE

[1994 3 SLR 290], Fernando J, in a very brief judgment, expressed the view that the Cabinet

of Ministers is not necessarily bound to act in terms of Service Minute such as P2.

But, I would think that, in the absence of a published directive issued by the Cabinet of

Ministers to adopt a special procedure and follow specified guidelines which are required by

reasons of policy and are based on objective and rational criteria, the Cabinet of Ministers

would be expected to act in terms of the existing Service Minute marked P2 other than in

instances where a lacuna in P2 is detected that and the Cabinet of Ministers acts specifically

for the purposes of addressing that lacuna. [Emphasis added]

In Ratnasiri & others vs. Ellawala & others [2004] 2 Sri LR 180, the Court of Appeal

has discussed on the issue of absence of specific legislation or subordinate legislation which

expressly repeal and replace the existing law or regulation and the Court has observed that

Page 9 of 10

the later cannot be wiped out. Saleem Marsoof J. (as he was then P/CA) referring to a

judgement of Wanasundera J. held as follows;

As Wanasundera J. observed in The Public Service United Nurses Union v

Montague Jayewickrema, Minister of Public Administration and Others (S.C.

Application No. 4/87 decided on 29.04.1988) at 230 - ..........when existing general

rules are sought to be altered, this too must be done in the same manner and following the

identical procedures as for their formulation, namely, by enacting an ending rule.

The approval contained in 1R18 does not constitute rules, regulations and procedures of

general application which could replace the pre-existing rules, regulations and procedures

including the Establishments Code. In the circumstances, the court holds that 1R18 is not in

any manner sanctioned by Article 61B of the Constitution. The court is of the opinion that

the Public Service Commission has not made any contrary provisions which will discontinue

the application of the pre-existing rules, regulations and procedures including the provision of

the manual of transfer and Chapter III of the Establishments Code.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that filling the vacancies in the Deputy Medical

Administrative Grade otherwise than in terms of and/or in contravention of the Service

Minute as amended would be ultra vires, arbitrary and unreasonable.

It is observed as per the justification paragraphs of the Cabinet Memorandum marked

1R8 many representations have been made to the Ministry of Health and also to the

Honourable Minster by individuals, stakeholders and associations quoting various

discrepancies and discriminations resulting from the amendments in 1R7(b) and that the

procedure followed in making such amendments is wrong. In the circumstances, I issue

a Writ of Prohibition, prohibiting the 1st to 3rd Respondents from taking any steps to fill

vacant posts in the Deputy Medical Administrative Grade of the Health (Medical) Service

otherwise than in terms of the said Service Minute (as amended by Extraordinary Gazette

Notification No. 2218/50 published on 09.03.2021) until the Public Service Commission

expressly repeal or replace any provision of the existing Service Minute (as amended)

concurring the Cabinet decision dated 12.07.2021.

However, I am not inclined to issue a Writ of Mandamus as prayed for in the prayer of

the Petition as this Court does not wish to usurp the authority of 1st to 3rd Respondents in

deciding as to when the existing vacancies in the said post of Deputy Medical

Page 10 of 10

Administrative Grade will be filled. The Court is mindful of the fact that several other

rules and regulations or circulars issued by the Ministry of Finance should be adhered to

by the authorities before filling such vacancies in public service. Moreover, any material

or facts relating to that aspect has not been placed before this Court.
