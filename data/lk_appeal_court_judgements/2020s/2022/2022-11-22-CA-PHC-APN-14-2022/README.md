Before: Menaka Wijesundera J.

Neil Iddawala J.

Counsel: Kasun Liyanage for the petitioner.

Ridma Kuruwita, SC for the State.

Argued On: 01.11.2022

Decided On: 22.11.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to obtain bail for the suspect

namely Madiha Archchige Sampth Athula Gunawardena under the

provisions of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act

No 13 of 1984. The suspect in the instant matter had been arrested on

19.10.2020 for being in possession of 3.33g of Heroin. The main

contention of the Counsel for the suspect is that when the suspect was

produced before the Magistrate the B report filed before Court did not

specify the place from where the Heroin was recovered, instead it had

only mentioned that the Heroin was recovered from the custody of the

suspect. Hence the Counsel submitted that the suspect is greatly

prejudiced by this fact and that he is in remand since the date of arrest

and subsequently even after the receipt of the Government Analyst

report the suspect is in remand without any judicial proceedings being

concluded against him.

The Attorney General objected to this application and stated that the

Counsel for the suspect has not averred any exceptional circumstances

in the instant matter.

Considering the submissions of both parties the law relating to the

instant matter is that when a suspect is produced under the provisions

of Poisons, Opium And Dangerous Drugs Act under section 54 (A) (B) bail

can be considered only under section 83 which says that No person

suspected or accused of an offence under Section 54A or Section 54B of

this Ordinance shall be released on bail, except by the High Court, in

exceptional circumstances

The term exceptional had not been defined in the statute. But in some of

the cases so far decided has enumerated the term exceptional to be

depending on the facts of each case. Some of the circumstances which

have been considered to be exceptional are,

i. The delay considered in the case of Milroy Fernando vs. AG

CA Bail 542/90

ii. The period in remand considered in the case of OIC Police

Narcotic Bureau vs. Kanahalagamage Suneehta CA Revision

3/2002

iii. Nature of the offence considered in the case of Mohansing

vs. State of Utra Pradesh

In the instant matter the exceptionality pleaded by the Counsel for the

suspect is the failure of the police to state the exact place of Heroin from

where it was recovered while in the custody of the suspect. At this

juncture this Court draws its attention to the case of CA (PHC) APN

09/2019 decided on 19.07.2010 by Sisira De Abrew, J where it had been

Page 6 of 6

held that the police have failed to state the particular place (the body

of the suspect) where Heroin was found it had been considered a

suitable situation to consider bail against the suspect who had been

arrested for being in possession of 50g of Heroin.

Therefore, in the light of the above mentioned case we are unable to

agree with the learned State Counsel that the Counsel for the suspect has

failed to plead any exceptional circumstances, the above mentioned

exceptionality cited by the Counsel for the suspect we hold as good

enough to enlarge the suspect namely Madiha Archchige Sampath Athula

Gunawardena on bail.

As such the instant application for bail is allowed and the impugned order

of the learned High Court Judge dated 27.10.2021 is hereby set-aside and

we direct the learned High Court Judge to enlarge above mentioned

suspect namely Madiha Archchige Sampath Athula Gunawardena on

suitable conditions of bail.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
