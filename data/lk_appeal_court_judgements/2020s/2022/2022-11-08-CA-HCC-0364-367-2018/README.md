4. At the same time and at the same transaction, the appellants caused

After trial without a jury, all four appellants were found guilty as charged by the

learned High Court Judge of Kandy of his judgement dated 22-10-2018.

Accordingly, all of them were sentenced to death on count one.

On count two, the appellants were sentenced to two years each rigorous

imprisonment, and they were ordered to pay a fine of Rs.10000/- each. In

default, they were sentenced to six months each rigorous imprisonment. In

addition, each of the four appellants were ordered to pay Rs.50000/- each to

PW-02, and in default, they were sentenced to six months each rigorous

imprisonment.

On count three, each of the appellants were sentenced to two years rigorous

imprisonment and in addition, they were ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 10000/-

each. They were sentenced to six months rigorous imprisonment in default of

paying the fine. In addition to the above, each of the appellants were ordered to

pay Rs.15000/- each as compensation to PW-02 and in default they were

sentenced to six months each rigorous imprisonment.

On the fourth count, each of the appellants were sentenced to two years rigorous

imprisonment, and in addition they were ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 10000/-

Page 4 of 10

All the appellants ordered to pay Rs. 6000/- each to the fund that has been

established in terms of section 29 of the Victims and Witness Protection Act No.

04 of 2015. It has been decided to recover the said amount as a fine and in

default the appellants were sentenced to six months each rigorous

imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the appellants preferred

this appeal.

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellants intimated

to the Court that she is not in a position to establish that the trial Court has

failed to offer the option available to the appellants as to whether they elect to be

tried by a jury or by a High Court Judge, in its correct manner in terms of section

195 (ee) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, and hence, she is not pursuing

that as one of her grounds of appeal.

Accordingly, the learned Counsel for the appellants urged the following two

grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. The medical evidence adduced at the trial does not support a conviction

for murder as the prosecution has failed to prove that the injuries

suffered by the deceased were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary

cause of nature.

2. In any event, the evidence led at the trial warrants consideration by the

Court of a lesser culpability.

The facts that led to the incident as made available by way of evidence before the

trial Court can be summarized in the following manner.

This incident has happened on 17-09-2004 around 8.00 pm. On the mentioned

day, there had been a Kovil festival at the Kovil managed by the deceased. That

nights festival ritual was scheduled to be conducted by the villagers. The person

who was to be carrying the statue of the God for whom the Kovil has been

Page 5 of 10

dedicated has been selected by drawing lots, where the 12-year-old grandson of

the deceased has been selected for that purpose.

The appellants who were present at the festival had objected for allowing the boy

to carry the statue and this has led to a verbal altercation with the deceased. As

a result, it is alleged that the first appellant attacked and cut the hand of the

deceased using a pruning knife that he was carrying. With the cut injury to his

hand, the deceased has returned to his house which was nearby. The four

appellants who followed the deceased has assaulted and caused further cut

injuries to the deceased. This has happened in front of the line room where the

deceased was living. Thereafter, they have entered the line room and had caused

damage to the household items and has caused cut injuries to the wife of the

deceased, namely Yelukamalan and also to one Parameshwari.

The appellants have denied that they were involved in the incident, although

they have admitted that there was an altercation among the people who were

present at the Kovil festival. They have taken up this position when they were

called upon for a defence at the conclusion of the prosecution case by making

separate dock statements.

Consideration of the grounds of appeal

As the two grounds of appeal urged by the learned Counsel are interrelated, I

will now proceed to consider the said grounds of appeal together.

Pointing to the evidence of the doctor who has given evidence as PW-08 at the

trial, where he has marked his postmortem report as P-01, it was the main

contention of the learned Counsel that the doctor has failed to provide evidence

to show that the injuries suffered by the deceased were injuries that can be

termed as sufficient to cause the death of the deceased in the ordinary course of

nature.

Page 6 of 10

The learned Counsel pointed out that the evidence of the doctor in this regard

cannot be evidence that can be considered as evidence of the above mentioned

fact.

The learned Counsel contended that, out of the six injuries suffered by the

deceased, three cut injuries had been to the hand and to the right thigh of the

deceased. In the absence of any evidence to establish that those injuries or other

contusions observed by the doctor are injuries sufficient to cause death in the

ordinary course of nature, the evidence needs to be considered in that

perspective.

It was also the contention of the learned Counsel that, given the facts and the

circumstances of the case, this was an incident where the learned High Court

Judge should have considered the evidence in terms of section 294 exception 4

on the basis of a sudden fight.

It was contended further that although the appellants have not taken up such a

position at the trial, the learned High Court Judge should have considered that

fact and convicted the appellants in terms of section 297 of the Penal Code.

Having considered the factual situation and the relevant law, the learned Deputy

Solicitor General on behalf of the respondent, the Hon. Attorney General, invited

the Court to consider the facts and the circumstances and to reach a suitable

conclusion in this regard.

Dr. Sri Hari Singh Gour discusses the significance of the medical evidence in

relation to a cause of death in his book Penal Law of India, 11th Edition at

page 2398 in the following manner.

In all cases where a person dies, it is the duty of the prosecutor to put a

question to the doctor when he is examined in Court, as to the nature of the

injuries, i.e., whether they were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature

to cause death or likely to cause death, because the intention or the

knowledge of the person is to be inferred only from the nature of the injuries.

Page 7 of 10

Especially in the case of a murder, it is the bounded duty of the prosecutor

to put the question to the doctor. Whatever may be the opinion of the judge

or the prosecutor, it is always the duty of the Court as well as the prosecutor

in a murder case to have medical evidence on the point of the nature of the

injuries. Where this is not done the sessions Judge, when the case comes

up before him, ought to examine the doctor.

Stated further;

Absence of medical evidence, the Court must regard the injury as a lesser

injury, and hold that it is not a case of culpable homicide amounting to

murder. It all depends on the evidence about the injuries. If the injury is

such that the Court might itself think it to be sufficient in the ordinary course

of nature to cause death even without medical testimony, it may not be open

in some cases to say that it is a case of murder and therefore, it is desirable

that there must also be medical testimony.

In the case under consideration, the doctor who performed the postmortem on

the deceased has failed to give a definite finding as to whether the injuries

suffered by the deceased are fatal in the ordinary course of nature. Considering

the fact that the three cut injuries found on the body of the deceased have been

to the hand and the right thigh, the trial Court would not be in a position to

determine that fact without being supported by medical evidence.

Accordingly, I find merit in the first ground of appeal urged by the learned

Counsel.

However, it was the contention of the learned Counsel that the evidence adduced

before the trial Court has provided a sufficient basis for the learned trial Judge

to consider whether there was a sudden fight which resulted the deceased and

the others being injured in evaluating evidence. It is the view of this Court that

even if the accused party denies any involvement in the commission of the

offence, it is the duty of the learned trial Judge to consider that fact and

determine accordingly.

Page 8 of 10

In the case of The King Vs. Bellanavithanage Edwin 41 NLR 365, the Court of

Criminal Appeal held thus;

In a charge of murder, it is the duty of the judge to put to the jury the

alternative of finding the accused guilty of culpable homicide not amounting

to murder when there is any basis of such a finding in the evidence on

record, although such defence was not raised nor relied upon by the

accused.

In the case of the The King Vs. Albert Appuhamy 41 NLR 505, the Court of

Criminal Appeal held that,

Failure on the part of a prisoner or his Counsel to take up a certain line of

defence does not relieve a judge of the responsibility of putting to the jury

such a defence if it arises on the evidence.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the appellants is that the incident and

the actions of the appellants falls within the interpretation of section 294

exception 4 of the Penal Code. The said exception 4 reads as follows.

Exception 4. Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed

without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon

sudden quarrel without the offender having taken undue advantage

or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

Explanation- it is immaterial in such cases which party offers

the provocation or commits the first assault.

The necessary requisites of such a plea have been crystalized by Ratanlal and

Dhirajlal in their book Law of Crimes, 24th Edition 1998 at page 1339

referring to section 300 of the Indian Penal Code which section and the

exceptions are identical to section 294 of our Penal Code identifying that the

following requisites must be satisfied.

Page 9 of 10

1. It was a sudden fight.

2. There was no premeditation.

3. The act was committed in a heat of passion; and

4. The assailant had not taken any undue advantage or acted in a

cruel manner.

When considering the facts of the matter under consideration, it is very much

apparent that an argument as to who should carry the statue of the God has

sparked this incident as a sudden fight. It is also clear that there had been no

premeditation and the appellants had acted in the heat of passion. According to

the evidence, the 1st appellant has used the pruning knife he was carrying in

committing the cut injuries. A prune knife is a tool used to prune tea bushes

and a knife often carried by estate laborers as of habit. The evidence suggests

that no undue advantage has been taken and the cut injuries clearly show that

no injuries have been caused to the vital organs of the body of the deceased.

Considering the above facts and the circumstances, I am of the view that this is

a fit and proper case where the learned High Court Judge should have considered

as to whether this was an offence that comes under exception 4 of section 294

and punishable in terms of section 297 of the Penal Code, on the basis of

culpable homicide not amounting to murder. I find that there was sufficient

evidence before the learned High Court Judge to come to such a conclusion for

the reasons adduced as above.

Accordingly, I set aside the conviction of the appellants on the first count

preferred against them and replace the said conviction with a conviction for

culpable homicide not amounting to murder in terms of section 297 of the Penal

code.

Having considered the facts and the circumstances, I sentence the accused

appellants to a period of 10 years each rigorous imprisonment for the offence

they are now convicted. In addition, a fine of Rs. 10,000/- each is ordered on the

Page 10 of 10

accused appellants; in default they shall serve periods of six months each

rigorous imprisonment.

The sentences and the fines imposed as well as the compensation and the

amounts ordered to be paid in terms of Act No. 04 of 2015 and the default

sentences ordered in that regard by the learned High Court Judge in relation to

the 2nd, 3rd and the 4th counts shall remain the same.

Having considered the mischief that has been caused to the house of the

deceased and injuries cause to separate females at the same incident, the

sentences ordered in relation to all four counts shall be served consecutively to

each other.

Since the appellants have been in incarceration form the date of the conviction,

it is ordered that the sentence shall deem have been commenced from the date

of the conviction on 22-10-2018.

The appeal is partly allowed to the above extent.
