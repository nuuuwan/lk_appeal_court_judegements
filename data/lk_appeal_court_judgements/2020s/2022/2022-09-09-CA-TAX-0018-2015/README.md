Introduction

[1] This is an appeal by way of a Case Stated against the determination of the

Tax Appeals Commission dated 15.10.2015. By the said determination, the

Tax Appeals Commission, subject to condition, allowed the appeal of the

Respondent made against the determination of the Commissioner General

of Inland Revenue dated 22.10.2008. The period under appeal relates to

three years of assessment, 2001/2002, 2002/2003 and 2003/2004.

Factual Background

[2] The Respondent Holcim Lanka Limited acquired Puttalam Cement

Company Limited in 1996 and taken over the business and the assets of the

Sri Lanka Cement Corporation, in terms of the Conversion of Public

Corporations or Government Owned Business Undertakings into Public

Companies Act, No. 23 of 1987. The Respondent entered into anagreement

bearing No. 88 dated 04.06.1998 with the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka

under section 17 of the Board of Invsestment Law, No. 4 of 1978 (hereinafter

referred to as the BOI Law).

[3] Pursuant to the said agreement and the Regulations made under the BOI

Law and published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 1019/13 dated 17.03.1998

issued under the BOI Law, the Respondent became entitled to an exemption

from income tax subject to the following conditions:

3

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

1. The Respondent shall modernize, upgrade and operate the said

business at the land and premises morefully described in the First

Schedule to the agreement;

2. The Respondent shall make an investment not less than Rs. 1,500

million as the additional investment in the project within a period of 36

months from the date of the agreement, and the said additional

investment shall be infused for the above purpose;

3. The said period of exemption depends on the quantum of capital

infused as follows:

Value of Additional investment Period of exemption

500 M - 1499 M 10 years

1500 M - 2499 M 12 years

2500 M - 4499 M 15 years

Above - 5000 M 20 years

[4] The Respondent met the capital commitment of Rs. 500 Million to qualify

for the tax exemption in terms of the said BOI agreement and the Gazette

No. 1019/13. The Respondent infrormed the BOI that it wished to have the

tax holiday period commenced from 01.04.1999 but indicated to the BOI that

it would be investing in the project in excess of the Rs. 1,500 million by the

time the project is completed. Thereafter, the Respondent invested a sum of

Rs. 1,300 million in the project and opted for 10 years tax exemption period

commencing from 01.04.1999. Accordingly, the BOI reviewed the additional

investment requirement of Rs. 1,500 million and entered into the

supplementary agreement bearing No. 10 dated 06.07.2000 with the

Respondent. The Respondent thereafter completed the minimum additional

investment criterion of Rs. 1,500 million as required by clause 10(vi) of the

BOI agreement and the BOI issued the tax certificate dated 24.12.2002 under

and in terms of clause 10 (vi) of the BOI agreement bearing No. 88 dated

04.06.1998.

[5] The Respondent furnished the return of income for the year of

assessment 1998/1999 and declared a sum of Rs. 529,220,790/- as taxable

profit. The Respondent furnished the return of income for the year of

assessment, 1999/2000 and declared a sum of Rs. 50,579,372/- as taxable

4

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

loss. The Respondent furnished the return of income for the year of

assessment 2000/2001 and declared a sum of Rs. 59,068,407/- as brought

forward loss. The Respondent furnished the return of income for the year of

assessment 2001/2002 and declared a sum Rs. 117,349,938/- as statutory

income and Rs. 371,303,000/- as brought forward loss. The Respondent in its

tax adjustment increased the losses relating to years of assessment

1999/2000 and 2000/2001 as follows:

1999/2000 - Rs. 324,146,118.00

2000/2001 - Rs. 486,674,118.00

Total losses - Rs. 810,820,236.00

[6] The Assessor by letter dated 24.02.2006, rejected the returns of income

furnished by the Respondent for the year of assessment 2001/2002 for the

following reasons:

1. Interest claimed to be deducted under section 29 of the Inland Revenue

Act, No. 38 of 2000 cannot be allowed since, it should have been claimed

under section 23 of the Act;

2. Losses claimed by the tax adjustment statement cannot be allowed,

since the said losses are not taxable/allowable and the profits of the

enterprise have been exempted for a period of 10 years from

01.04.1999 under the BOI Law.

[7] The return furnished for the years of assessment 2002/2003 and

2003/2004 were also rejected on the same basis and the assessments were

issued in respect of the years of assessment 2001/2002, 2002/2003 and

2003/2004. The Respondent appealed to the Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue who by its determination dated 22.10.2008 allowed the

interest claimed under section 29 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000

on the basis of the computation given in the appeal, but rejected the losses

claimed by the tax adjustment statement dated 03.01.2005. Accordingly, the

assessments for the said periods were revised.

Appeal to the Board of Review

[8] Being dissatisfied with the said determination of the Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue, the Respondent appealed to the Board of Review.

Subsequently, with the enactment of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No.

5

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

23 of 2011 and the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of

2013, the appeal was transferred to the Tax Appeals Commission.

[9] The only issue before the Tax Appeals Commission (hereinafter referred

to as the TAC) was the tax exemption period and the date of the

commencement of the tax exemption period. The TAC by its determination

dated 15.10.2015 decided that the Respondent was entitled to a twelve (12)

year tax exemption period commencing on 01.01.2001 for the following

reasons:

1. In terms of clause 10 (i) and 10(vi) of the BOI agreement No. 88, the tax

exemption period shall be decided by the BOI in terms of the certificate

issued by the BOI, and the BOI in its certificate dated 24.12.2002 decided

that the 12 year tax exemption period commenced from 01.01.2001;

2. The Executive Director of the BOI by letter dated 24.12.2002 declared

that the Respondent is entitled to enjoy 12 year tax holiday period

commencing from 01.01.2001 and accordingly, the date of the

commencement of the tax holiday period should be considered as

01.01.2001.

[10] The relevant findings of the TAC at pp. 16 -17 of the determination, read

as follows:

On the strength of the certificate dated 24.12.2002 and the letter dated 02.06.2010, referred to above, there is no doubt as to the entitlement of the Appellant Company for a twelve (12) year tax exemption period which commenced from 01.01.2001. Accordingly, we hold that the date of the commencement of the tax holiday should be considered as 01.01.2001

The only issue for decision in this case was the period and the date of the commencement of the tax exemption. We have decided that the Appellant is entitled to a twelve (12) year tax exemption period which commenced on 01.01.2001. However, as to how the loss mentioned in this case is computed and its correctness should be decided by the Respondent. Subject to the above condition, we allowed the appeal of the Appellant.

[11] The TAC allowed the appeal of the Respondent subject to the above-

mentioned condition.

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

Appeal to the Court of Appeal

[12] Being dissatisfied with the said determination of the TAC, the Appellant

made an application to the TAC by letter dated 11.11.2015 for a Case Stated

for the opinion of the Court of Appeal. The TAC set out the following

questions of law in the Case Stated for the opinion of the Court of Appeal.

1. Has the TAC erred in law determining that the commencement date of

the exemption period on 01.01.2001 by ignoring the commencement

date in terms of the Original Agreement No. 88 entered by the above

company with the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka on 04.06.1998?

2. Has the TAC erred in law determining the date of commencement of

tax holiday as 01.01.2001 by ignoring the commencement date

01.04.1999 as agreed by the parties in terms of its Supplementary

Agreement No. 10 dated 06.07.2000, entered into between the

company and the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka?

3. Has the TAC erred in law determining that the commencement of tax

holiday date as 01.01.2001, without considering the facts that effect of

such decision increases the B/F losses since the company has claimed

large amount of capital allowances of fixed assets investment of the

company on the basis of commercial production has been commenced

on 01.04.1999?

4. Has the TAC erred in law coming to the conclusion that the date of

commencement decided was only for the mere fact of the amount of

investment and not considering the essential fact of commencement

of commercial production date of 01.04.1999?

5. Has the TAC erred in law coming to conclusion that the losses incurred

from 01.04.1998 to 31.12.2000 are entitled to be carried forward as the

profits of the enterprise have been exempted only from 01.01.2011

according to its determination?

6. Has the TAC erred in law coming to the conclusion on the period and

the date of the commencement of the tax exemption period, ignoring

that the powers of the BOI and the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue relating to review of scope agreement was slightly discussed

7

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

at the very recent Court of Appeal Cases of Ceylon Steel Corporation

Limited v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CA Tax/10/2010)

and CA/Tax/18/2013.

[13] At the hearing of the appeal, Mrs. Chaya Sri Nammuni, the Deputy

Solicitor General for the Appellant and Dr. K. Kanag-Isvaran, P.C. for the

Respondent made extensive oral submissions in respect of the above-

mentioned questions of law submitted for the opinion of the Court.

Issues to be Resolved

[14] In view of the submissions made by the learned Deputy Solicitor General

and Dr. K. Kanag-Isvaran, P.C., the issue before this Court for determination

is the period of tax exemption and the date of commencement of the tax

exemption period, the Respondent is contractually entitled to in terms of the

agreement between the Respondent and the BOI.

Submissions of the Appellant

[15] The learned Deputy Solicitor General challenged the date of

commencement of the tax exemption period specified in the certificate

issued by the BOI, and argued that Respondent is only entitled to a tax

holiday period of 10 years commencing from 01.04.1999. She submitted that

therefore, the Respondent is not entitled to claim losses for the years of

assessment 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 aggregating approximately to Rs. 819

Million for the following reasons:

1. Although the agreement No. 88 stipulated that the Respondent would

be given a 12 year tax exemption, if the Respondent actually infused a

sum of Rs. 1,500 million within a period of 36 months from the date of

the agreement, the said agreement is only a conditional agreement for

the following reasons:

(a) The said agreement stipulates that if the Respondent fails to meet

the investment of Rs. 1,500 million additional infusion, the said

agreement would be revised by the BOI.

(b) The said period of 12 years shall be reckoned from the date of the

first commercial production is made after the infusion of additional

8

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

capital. The first commercial production is, however, a one-time

occurrence. In the present case, the Respondents auditors have

admitted that the commercial production commenced on

01.04.1999 after meeting the additional capital infusion of the first

slab of over Rs. 500 Million.

2. The Respondents investment fell short of the required investment of

Rs. 1,500 million and therefore, the Respondent by letter dated

09.09.1999 opted for a 10 year tax exemption and agreed to commence

the tax holiday period from 01.04.1999 Therefore, the BOI entered into

a supplementary agreement No. 10 dated 06.07.2000 with the

Respondent, which provided that the Respondent was only entitled to a

tax exemption period of 10 years reckoned from 01.04.1999;

3. Although the BOI issued the certificate dated 24.12.2002, and the letter

dated 02.06.2010 stating that the Respondent was entitled to enjoy 12

year tax holiday commencing from 01.01.2001, by letter dated

02.06.2010, the BOI cancelled the letter dated 24.12.2002;

4. The cancellation of the supplementary agreement by letter dated

18.11.2009 is futile and therefore, the revocation of the supplementary

agreement by letter dated 18.11.2009 cannot override the contractual

obligations stipulated in the supplementary agreement, which supports

as evidence that the exemption was for a period of 10 years and not 12

years as claimed by the Respondent.

Submissions of the Respondent

[16] On the other hand, Dr. Kanag-Isvaran, P.C. submitted that in order to

avail itself of the 12 year tax holiday granted in terms of clause 10 (vi) of the

agreement, the Respondent was required to invest a sum of Rs. 1,500 million

prior to the 3rd June, 2001, which constituted 36 months from the date of

entering into the agreement. He submitted that the Respondent within the

contractually stipulated 36 months, completed the required investment of

Rs. 1,500 million, and by letter dated 22.10.2002 confirmed to the BOI that it

had invested a sum of Rs, 1,515 million during the period of 06.06.1998 to

31.12.2000.

9

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

[17] Dr. Kanag-Isvaran drew our attention to the certificate issued by the BOI

dated 24.12.2002 under and in terms of clause 10(vi) of the agreement and

strenuously contended that the said certificate issued by the BOI is the one

and only certificate issued by the BOI in terms of clause 10(vi) of the BOI

agreement entered into by the parties, which cannot be challenged before

the Court of Appeal in the current appeal by way of a Case Staed.

[18] He further submitted that prior to the expiry of the 36 month period to

invest a sum of Rs. 1,500 million, the parties entered into a supplementary

agreement, as a consequence of the uncertainty prevailed at that time as to

whether the Respondent would be in a position to invest the minimum

amount of Rs. 1,500 million to qualify for the enhanced 12 year tax holiday

in terms of clause 10(vi). He, however, argued that upon the Respondent

investing the required amount of Rs. 1,500 million prior to the expiration of

the 36 month period, the said supplementary agreement was of no force or

effect in law and was subsequently terminated by the BOI by its letter dated

18.11.2009, which was further confirmed by the Chairman of the BOI by his

letter dated 02.06.2010.

Analysis

Agreement between the Respondent and the BOI under the BOI Law

[19] It is not in dispute that section 17(1) of the Board of Investment of Sri

Lanka Law (hereinafter referred to as the BOI Law) empowers the BOI to

enter into agreements with any enterprise and grant exemptions from any

law referred to in Schedule B thereto, or modify or vary the application of any

such laws, to such enterprise in accordance with such regulations made by

the Minister. Section 17 of the BOI Law reads as follows:

(1) The Board shall have the power to enter into agreements with any enterprise

in or outside the Area of Authority and to grant exemptions from any law referred to in Schedule B hereto, or to modify or vary the application of any such laws, to such enterprises in accordance with such regulations as may be made by the Minister.

(2) Every such agreement shall be reduced to writing and shall, upon registration

with the Board, constitute a valid and binding contract between the Board and the enterprise.

10

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

[20] Clause 2 (ii) of the Regulations, No. 1 of 1998 made by Gazette No.

1019/13 dated 19.03.1998 made by the President under section 24 of the BOI

That the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 28 of 1979 relating to the imposition, payment and recovery of income tax in respect of the profits and income shall not apply in respect of the existing enterprise or a new enterprise which is found by the acquisition of assets of an existing enterprise and which is engaged in the manufacture of cement, steel or textiles manufacturing and/or textile processing industry including yarn and/or thread or with the approval of the Minister any other industry as may be determined by the Board with an additional investment of any sum of such value as is specified in column I below, to meet the additional cost of the project for the period specified in the corresponding entries in column II. The said period should be reckoned from the date on which the enterprise makes its first commercial export or production, as the case may be, after the additional investment is made.[Emphasis added]

with the BOI and in terms of the clause 10 of the said agreement, the

business carried out by the Respondent was afforded certain benefits and

11

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

tax exemptions subject to the conditions set out in the recital to the said

agreement, and clause 10(i) and 10(iv) of the said agreement as follows:

1. To modernize and upgrade the existing cement factory at Puttalam for the

manufacture of cement, its stores, quarry and transport system on the land

at Puttlammorefully described in the First Schedule to the Agreement

(Recital to the Agreement);

2. In accordance with and subject to the powers conferred on the Board under

section 17 of the said law No. 4 of 1978 and the Regulations that may be

applicable thereto the following benefits and/or exemptions and/or

privileges are hereby granted to the enterprise, in connection with and/or

in relation to the said business.

(i) hereinafter referred to as said tax exemption For a period of 12

years reckoned from the year of assessment as may be

determined by the Board (period) the provisions of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 28 of 1979 relating to the imposition , payment and

recovery of income tax in respect of the profits and income of the

Enterprise shall not apply to the profits and income of the

Enterprise;

For the above purpose the year of assessment shall be reckoned

from the date on which the enterprise makes its first commercial

productionafter the additional investment is made as specified

in a certificate issued by the Board.

Provided, however, in the event the investment actually committed

were to fall short of the required amount, the tax exemption period

granted to the enterprise by the Board will be reviewed accordingly.

The enterprise shall ensure to obtain a certificate annually to the

effect that the tax exemption period is available to the Enterprise

12

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

[22] Pursuant to the said agreement and the regulations published in the

Gazette, No. 1019/13, the Respondent became entitled to an exemption

from income tax subject to the following two conditions:

1. The Respondent must invest the minimum additional investment of Rs.

1,500 million within a period of 36 months from the date of the

agreement;

2. The tax certificate issued by the BOI must be obtained by the Respondent

as stated in clause 10(i) of the agreement.

Determination of the tax exemption period and the date of the

commencement of the tax exemption period?

[23] Now the question is who should decide the tax exemption period and

the date of commencement of the tax exemption period in terms of the

agreement between the Respondent and the BOI. As noted, section 17(1) of

the BOI Law provides that the BOI shall have the power to grant exemptions

from any law referred to in Schedule B thereto, or to modify or vary the

application of any such laws, to such enterprises in accordance with such

regulations as may be made by the Minister. According to Clause 10 (i) of the

BOI agreement, subject to the powers conferred on the BOI under section

17 of the said Law, and the regulations that may be applicable, the

Respondent was entitled to a period of 12 years tax exemption from the

year of assessment as may be determined by the BOI. The said 12 year tax

exemption, however, will apply on the specific undertaking of the

Respondent that the minimum additional investment of the Respondent

shall not be less than Rs. 1,500 million to be made within a period of 36

months from the date of the agreement made on 04.06.1998 (clause 10 (vi).

[24] Clause 10(i) of the agreement further makes provision for the

determination of the year of assessment, and provides that the year of

assessment shall be reckoned from the date on which the enterprise makes

its first production after the additional investment is madeas specified

in a certificate issued by the Board. Accordingly, it is the BOI that should

determine whether the Respondent has fulfilled the minimum additional

investment of the enterprise which shall not be less than Rs. 1,500 million

to be made within a period of 36 months from the date of the agreement.

13

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

Minimum additional investment of Rs. 1,500 million&issuance of BOI

certificate

[25] In order to be entitled to the 12 year tax exemption period granted in

terms of clause 10(i) of the agreement, the Respondent was required to

invest a sum of Rs. 1,500 million within a period of 36 months from the date

of the agreement. This means that in terms of clause 10(vi), the Respondent

was required to invest the said sum of Rs. 1,500 million prior to 03.06.2001.

The Respondent completed the required investment criterion of Rs. 1,500

million within the contractually stipulated period set out in clause 10(vi) of

the Agreement (Vide- pp. 420-422 of the TAC brief).

[26] The BOI by letter dated 24.12.2002 acknowledged and confirmed that

the Respondent has fulfilled the condition stipulated in section 10 (vi) of the

agreement and issued the certificate dated 24.12.2002 under and in terms

of clause 10(vi) of the agreement. The said certificate reads as follows:

Managing Director, Holcim Lanka Limited, Level 3, Hemas House 75, Braybrook Place Colombo 02.

Dear Sir,

HOLCOM LANKA LIMITED-(Formerly Puttalam Cement Company Ltd) Issuance of Tax Certificate

We refer to the Agreement No. 88 dated 4th June 1998 entered into between the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and Your enterprise and confirm that you have fulfilled the condition stipulated in section 10 (vi) therein.

Accordingly, the twelve (12) year tax exemption period has commenced from 01st January 2001. Yours faithfully, Eeecutive Director (Monitoring) Board of Investment of Sri Lanka

Co. (i) Commissioner-General, Department of Inland Revenue. (ii)M/s. KPMG Ford Rhodes, Thorinton& Co., (Chartered Accountants)

14

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

[27] In the circumstances, the BOI determined that the Respondent

invested a sum of Rs. 1,500 million within a period of 36 months from the

date of the agreement as required by clause 10 (vi) of the agreement and

issued the certificate under clause 10(vi) of the agreement declaring that

the twelve (12) year tax exemption period commenced from 01.01.2001.

Supplementary Agreement

[28] It is not in dispute that in terms of clause 10(vi) of the agreement, the

Respondent had time till 03.06.2001 to commit the minimum additional

investment of Rs. 1,500 million to the project. According to the letter dated

02.09.1999 of the Chairman of the BOI, the Respondnetby letter dated

23.08.1999 informed the BOI that it has made a total investment of Rs.

1,150 million and wished to make the balance before the end of the year

1999 (p. 115 of the TAC brief). The Chairman of the Respondent company

by letter dated 09.09.1999 wrote to the BOI expressing willingness to

commence the tax holiday period from 01.04.1999 whilst reiterating that it

would be spending far in excess of the Rs. 1,500 million by the time the

whole upgrade is completed (p. 114 of the TAC brief).

[29] It is relevant to note that the Respondent made an additional

investment of Rs. 1,300 million for the restructuring and upgrading of the

said business during the period stipulated in the BOI agreement No. 88,

and by letter dated 25.05.2000, opted to enjoy for a tax exemption period

of ten (10) years commencing from 01.01.1999 (see-recital 5 of the

supplementary agreement dated 06.07.2000 at p. 82 of the TAC brief). The

BOI having reviewed the additional investment of Rs. 1,300 million

committed by the Respondent at that time, and the confirmation of the

Respondent opting for the 10 year tax exemption period from 01.04.1999,

entered into the supplementary agreement bearing No. 10 dated

06.07.2000 (pp 80-83 of the Tac brief).

[30] Proviso to clause 10 (i) of the BOI Agreement deals with a situation

where the investment made by the enterprise falls short of the required

amount of 1,500 million. It provides that in the event the investment

actually committed were to fall short of the required amount, the tax

exemption period granted to the enterprise by the Board will be reviewed

by the BOI and the Enterprise shall ensure to obtain a certificate annually

15

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

to the effect that the tax exemtion is available to the enterprise until thefull

amount of Rs. 1,500 million is committed to the project. The proviso to

clause 10(i) is reproduced for clarity as follows:

Provided however, in the event the investment actually committed were to fall short of the required amount, the tax exemption period to the Enterprise by the Board will be reviewed accordingly. The Enterprise shall ensure to obtain a certificate annually to the effect that the tax exemption is available to the Enterprise from the Board until the full amount of Rupees One Thousand Five Hundred Million (Rs. 1500 Mn) is committed to the project of the enterprise.

[31] It is crystal clear that the principal agreement was modified by the

parties in consideration of the additional investment of Rs. 1,300 million

committed by the Respondent at that time, and therefore, the

supplementary agreement was entered into by the parties in consequence

of the review made by the BOI to meet the proviso to clause 10(i) of the

Agreement.

[32] The learned Deputy Solicitor General relied on clause 6 of the recital

and clause 1 of the supplementary agreement, and argued that in terms of

those clauses, the Respondent had opted for a 10 year tax exemption

period commencing from 01.04.1999 instead of 12 years and therefore, the

supplementary agreement is the legally binding document embodying the

final decision with regard to the issuance of the tax exemption period and

not the principal agreement. Clause 1 of the supplementary agreement

reads as follows:

Notwithstanding anything stated in the said Agreement, the profits and income of the Enterprise in connection with and/or in relation to the said business shall be exempted from the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 28 of 1979 for a period of 10 years reckoned from 1st April 1999 in consideration of the additional investment of Rupees One Thousand Three Hundred Million (Rs. 1300) Mn) already made by the Enterprise in respect of restructuring and upgrading of the said business

[33] The said supplementary agreement only modified the principal

agreement No. 88 dated 04.06.1998 to the extent that the tax exemption

period of 12 years was substituted to a period of 10 years, and the

additional investment Rs. 1,500 million was substituted to Rs. 1,300 million.

16

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

Subject to those modifications to the principal BOI agreement, No. 88, the

principal agreement continued to be in full force and effect and binding

between the parties. It is relevant to note that the supplementary

agreement is supplemental to the principal agreement and the principal

agreement remained in full force and effect and binding on the parties as

set out in the following clause 5 of the supplementary agreement:

This Agreement shall be supplemental to the said Agreement and the said Agreement modified as aforesaid shall continue to be in full force and effect and binding between the parties hereto.

[34] Under clause 5 of the supplementary agreement, the supplementary

and the principal agreement to the extent modified by the supplementary

agreement, have to be read together to make a complete agreement

between the parties. In my view, the supplementary agreement is not an

independent agreement, but is only supplemental to the principal

agreement to the extent modified by the supplementary agreement. For

those reasons, I am not inclined to agree with the submission of the learned

Deputy Solicitor General that the supplementary agreement is the legally

binding document embodying the final decision with regard to the issuance

of the tax exemption period.

Conduct of the parties upon entering into the supplementary

agreement

[35] The supplementary agreement was signed on 06.07.2000 but the BOI

did not issue any annual certificate to the Respondent on the basis of the

supplementary agreement entered into between the parties declaring that

the Respondent was entitled to the ten (10) year tax exemption period

commencing from 01.04.1999.The Respondent who, previously, wished to

make the higher additional investment criterion of Rs. 1,500 million within

a period of 36 months as required by the principal agreement, met the

higher additional investment requirement of Rs. 1,500 million during the

period of June 6, 1998 to December 31, 2000 (pp.420-422).

[36] The BOI was satisfied that the Respondent has fulfilled the condition

stipulated in clause 10(vi) of the principal agreement, and therefore

17

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

determined that the 12 year tax exemption period commenced from

01.01.2001 and issued the tax certificate accordingly.

[37] The Respondent by letter dated 20.03.2003 informed the Appellant

that the BOI issued the tax certificate for the 12 year tax exemption period

to commence from 01.01.2001 and submitted the tax adjustment

statement declaring losses for the years of assessment 1999/2000,

2000/2001 and 2001/2002 (pp. 15-18 of the TAC brief). It is also relevant to

note that the Executive Director (Monitoring) of the BOI by letter dated

13.10.2004 informed the Appellant that in terms of the tax certificate dated

24.12.2002 issued by the BOI, the tax holiday has commenced from

01.01.2001 (p. 19 of the TAC brief). The the said letter reads as follows:

Mr. E.A. Edirisinghe, Deputy Commissioner, LTU Audit Unit, 6, Dept. of Inland Revenue Sir Chittampalam A. Gardiner Mawatha Colombo 2.

HOLCIM LANKA LTD, COMMENCEMENT OF TAX HOLIDAY PERIOD We refer to your letter dated 09.09.2004 regarding the above and wish to clarify the following:

1. In reply to a clarification sought by the enterprise, BOI has inquired by

our letter dated 2nd September 99, whether the enterprise wishes to qualify:

(a) For 10 year tax holiday period commencing from 1st April 1999 by

investing Rs. 500 Million;or (b) 12 year tax holiday period investing Rs. 1500 Mn. Since the enterprise

has requested to issue them the tax certificate immediately after investing an additional amount of Rs. 500 Mn.

2. Though Holcim Lanka Ltd. Has informed the Board that they wish to

commence their tax holiday period from 1st April 99, we could have agreed for same if they have opted for the entitlement of 10 year tax holiday period by investing an additional investment of Rs. 500 Mn. However, the Board has not issued the tax certificate on that basis;

3. Subsequently, the KPMG Ford Rhodes Thornton & Co., the tax authorities

in behalf of Holcim Lanka Ltd. By its letter dated 27th September 2002

18

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

(copy attached) has requested to issue the tax certificate on the basis of an investment of Rs. 1500 Mn. and 12 years tax holiday period as provided for in the Agreement. Having examined their request and since the required investment was made by the enterprise as at 31st December 2002. Accordingly, the tax holiday has commenced from 01.01.2001.

Trust the above clarification sastisfies with your requirements.

Yours faithfully,

A.M.C. Karunasekera Executive Director (Monitoring)

[38] It is true that the Respondent having made an investment commitment

of Rs. 1,300 million previously, opted for a 10 year tax exemption as set out

in the supplementary agreement. It is also necessary, however, to take into

consideration the circumstances in which it was written and the intention

which the supplementary agreement was to convey, and how the parties

acted subsequently, under the principal agreement. In this regard, it is

relevant to reproduce the following observations contained in a Bench of

the Madras High Court in Mangalam v. C.S. Appavoo AIR 1976 Mad. 360, at

p. 363:

[46] 8. As each case has to be decided on its own facts, it cannot be laid down with precision that the language deployed in an instrument should govern in all circumstances and for all times, notwithstanding the fact the parties who had occasion to refer to it intended that it should be understood in a specified way. If there is such evidence of supervising the conduct by the parties, then, notwithstanding the express nature of the words used in an instrument, such surrounding circumstances might be taken into consideration in order to understand the legal effect of the words used by the parties to the instrument.

[39] It is, therefore, abundantly clear that the subsequent conduct of the

Respondent and the BOI indicated that irrespective of the supplementary

agreement, the Respondent met the higher additional investment

requirement of Rs. 1,500 million within a period of 36 months from the date

of the principal agreement, and the BOI confirmed that the Respondent

fulfilled the condition stipulated in clause 10(vi) of the principal agreement.

Accordingly, the BOI issued the tax certificate determining that the 12 year

tax exemption period commenced from 01.01.2001.

19

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

Cancellation of the Supplementary Agreement

[40] It was the contention of Mr. Kanag-Isvaran, P.C. that upon the

Respondent investing the required capital of Rs. 1,500 million before the

expiration of the 36 month period, the said supplementary agreement was

of no force or effect in law and accordingly, the BOI by letter dated

18.11.2009 terminated the said supplementary agreement. A perusal of the

said letter reveals that the supplementary agreement was cancelled by the

BOI on the basis that the Respondent had achieved the additional

investment of Rs. 1,500 million during the period of 36 months in terms of

clause 10(vi) of the agreement. The said letter reads as follows:

Managing Director, HOLCIM (LANKA) LIMITED, No. 413, R.A.De Mel Mawatha, Colombo 03.

HOLCIM (LANKA) LIMITED,

I write on the instructions of the Investment and Monitoring Department of the Board to inform you that having noted that you have achieved the required investment of Rs. 1.5 Bn, within the time period granted under the principal Agreement, we hereby cancel and terminate the supplementary agreement No. 10 dated 6th July 2000 entered into between the Board and HOLCIM (LANKA) LIMITED.

[41] The learned Deputy Solicitor General however, submitted that the said

letter cancelling the supplementary agreement was issued by the BOI

nearly 10 years after the completion of the tax exemption period granted

by the BOI to the Respondent which came into effect from 01.04.1999 and

therefore, the purpose of the supplementary agreement of granting 10

years tax exemption has been fulfilled and completed, when the

cancellation letter was issued on 18.11.2009. She further challenged the

cancellation of the supplementary agreement by the BOI by letter dated

18.11.2009 relying on a letter sent by the Executive Director (Legal) of the

BOI dated 25.01.2010 in which she has proceeded to withdraw his own

letter dated 18.11.2009 (p. 458).

[42] The said Executive Director (Legal) has withdrawn the said letter dated

18.11.2009 by her own letter dated 25.01.2010 on the basis that

20

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

Respondent had enjoyed the tax holiday period with effect from 01.04.1999

in terms of the supplementary agreement, contrary to the tax certificate

issued by the BOI on 24.12.2002 determining that the twelve year tax

exemption period has commenced from 01.01.2001 (p. 461).

[43] In view this confusion created by the said letter of the Executive

Director (Legal) dated 25.01.2010, which almost had the effect of cancelling

the certificate issued by the BOI by letter dated 24.12.2002, the Chairman

of the Respondent Company, by his letter dated 02.06.2010 (p. 416) wrote

to the Chairman/Director-General of the BOI complaining against the said

Executive Director (Legal)s letter dated 25.01.2010 and requesting the

Chairman/Director-General of the BOI to withdraw the said letter dated

25.01.2010.

[44] In order to dispel any confusion created by the said letter of the

Executive Director (Legal) dated 25.01.2010, the Chairman/Director-

General of the BOI by his letter dated 02.06.2010 (p. 457) informed the

Respondent with a copy to the Appellant that:

1. As per the decision taken by the Board on 24.05.2010, the

supplementary agreement was cancelled and terminated; and

2. The principal agrement stands in force and the Respondent is entitled

to enjoy 12 years tax holiday period commencing from 01.01.2001.

[45] The said letter dated 02.06.2010 reads as follows:

HOLCIM (LANKA) LIMITED-TERMINATION OF A SUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENT

This is to inform you that the Supplementary Agreement, No. 10 dated 6th July 2000 entered into between Holcim Lanka Limited and the Board in terms of the BOI Law, No. 4 of 1978 is hereby cancelled and terminated, as per the decision taken by the Board on 24th May 2010. Please be informed that the Principal Agreement which the Board has entered into with Holcom Lanka (Private) Limited stands in force and in terms of the principal Agreement, Holcim Lanka (Private) Limited is entitled to enjoy 12 years tax holiday period commencing from 1st January 2001, as already informed by Executive Director (Monitoring), BOI by his letter dated 24th December 2002.

21

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

Yours faithfully, Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Sgd

Chairman/Director-General

[46] The letter of the Chairman/Director-General of the BOI is a clear

confirmation of the tax certificate dated 24.12.2002 issued by the BOI on

the basis that (a) as the Respondent invested a sum of Rs. 1,500 million

within a period of 36 months from the date of the BOI Agreement, the

supplementary agreement, was cancelled, as per the decision taken by the

Board on 24th May 2010; and (b) therefore the principal agreement shall

stand in force and in terms of the principal agreement, the Respondent is

entitled to enjoy 12 years tax holiday period commencing from 1st January

2001. For those reasons, I am of the view that there is no merit in the

submission of the Appellant that the cancellation of the letter dated

18.11.2009 by the letter dated 25.01.2010 validates the tax exemption of 10

years given in the supplementary agreement dated 06.07.2000.

First commercial production date

[47] The next argument of the Appellant was that the first commercial

production was made by the Respondent on 01.04.1999 as indicated in the

written submissions filed on behalf of the Respondent at p. 45 of the TAC

brief. The contention of the Appellant was that though the Respondent can

continue to invest an additional investment, it cannot have two or more

first productions as the first commercial production referred to in Gazette

No. 1019/13 is a one-time occurrence and the tax exemption commenced

from the date of the first commercial production that occurred on

01.04.1999. Accordingly, the Appellant argued that 01.04.1999 shall be

regarded as the date on which the tax exemption commenced.

[48] The Gazette No. No. 1019/13 provides that the provisions of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 28 of 1979 shall not apply in respect of an enterprise

which is engaged in certain industries as may be determined by the Board

with an additional investment of any sum of such value as is specified in

column I below, to meet the additional cost of the project for the period

specified in the corresponding entries in column II. It further provides that

the tax exemption period specified in column II should be reckoned from

22

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

the date on which the enterprise makes its first commercial export or

production, as the case may be, after the additional investment is made

as follows:

Column I Column II

Value of additional investment Period of exemption

(a) Not less than Rs. 500 Million to 10 years Rs. 1,499 Million (b) Not less than Rs. 1,500 Million to

Rs. 2,499 Million 12 years

(c) Not less than Rs. 2,500 Million to 15 years Rs. 4,499 Million

(d) Above Rs. 5,000 Million 20 years

[49] According to the said Gazettee, the tax holiday period will depend on

the higher additional investment of any sum of such value as is specified in

column I is made to meet the additional cost of the project specified in

column II. The effect of this clause of the Gazettee is that the tax exemption

period will commence on the date of the first commercial production after

meeting the higher investment criterion, and not on the date of the

lowest additional investment criteria (Rs. 500 million) is made.

[50] The Respondent in the present case met the higher additional

investment criteria of Rs. 1,500 million within a period of 36 months from

the date of the agreement dated 04.06.1998, and claimed the 12 year tax

holiday from the date of the first commercial production after making the

higher additional investment criteria of Rs. 1,500 million. If the Respondent

was able to meet only the lowest additional investment criterion of Rs. 500

million or Rs. 1,300 million within a period of 36 months from the date of

the principal agreement, I accept the Appellants argument that the tax

holiday period would have commenced on 01.04.1999, which was the date

of the first commercial production after meeting the lowest investment

criterion of either Rs. 500 million or Rs. 1,300 million. However, it is not the

case here.

[51] In the instant case, however, the tax certificate was issued by the BOI

on 24.12.2002 only upon the fulfilment of the higher additional investment

23

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

commitment of Rs. 1,500 million within a period of 36 months and in terms

of clause 2(ii) of the Gazette No. 1019 /13, the tax exemption period shall

be reckoned from the date on which the enterprise makes its first

commercial production after an additional investment of any sum of

such value as is specified in column I to meet the additional cost of the

project for the period specified in column II. In my view, the determination

made by the BOI as specified in the certificate issued by the BOI on

24.12.2002 is consistent with clause 2 (ii) of the Gazette No. 1019/13, and

the principal BOI agreement No. 88 dated 04.06.1998.

[52] Accordingly, I am not inclined to agree with the submission of the

Appellant that the first commercial production date ought to be regarded

as 01.04.1999 when the additional investment of Rs. 1,500 million was

made within a period of 36 months from the date of the principal BOI

agreement as required by clause 10(vi) of the principal agreement.

[53] The Appellant seeks to challenge the tax certificate issued by the BOI

in terms of clause 10(vi) of the BOI Act on the ground, inter alia, that it has

been issued contrary to the already decided tax exemption period set out

in the supplementary agreement. It is to be noted that the tax certificate

dated 24.12.2002 issued by the BOI is the one and only certificate issued

by the BOI in terms of clause 10(vi) of the BOI agreement No. 88 as correctly

submitted by Mr. Kanag-Isvaran.

[54] This raises the question whether or not the tax certificate issued by the

BOI in terms of clause 10(vi) of the principal agreement can be challenged

by the Appellant in this proceeding. Mr. Kanag-Isvaran heavily relied on the

decisions of the Court of Appeal in Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue

v. Seylan Development PLC (C.A. (TAX) Appeal No. 10/2004 decided on

06.04.2017 and Setmil Developers Lanka (Pvt) Ltd v. Commissioner of Inland

Revenue C.A./TaxNo. 27/2019 decided on 22.03.2022 in support of his

contention that it is the BOI that must determine the date of the

commencement of the tax exemption period, and specify it in the certificate

issued by the BOI, as it has happened in the present case. He submitted

that therefore, the certificate issued by the BOI cannot be challenged by

the Appellant in this proceeding unless the Appellant challenged the said

certificate by way of writ proceeding.

24

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

[55] In Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue v. Seylan Development PLC

(supra), the Respondent entered into an agreement with the BOI and clause

10 (1) of the said agreement provided a tax exemption clause. The

Respondent in that case sought to deduct the loss incurred in the year

1998/1999 from the total statutory income as that loss could have been

assessed under section 32 (5) (b) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006.

The Court of Appeal was called upon to decide the single question: when

does the tax holiday period commence? In other words, the question was:

Is it the date determined by the Assessor or it is the date determined by

the BOI which has been confirmed by the Tax Appeal Commission. His

Lordship Surasena, J. held that:

Careful consideration of clause 10(1) of the Agreement shows that there must be two basic requirements for the tax exemption period to commence. Those two requirements are as follows:

1. Either the Respondent must have commenced making profits or a period

of 5 years must have lapsed from the date of its commercial or production operation;

2. The BOI must have determined and specified the year (described in I

above) in a certificate issued by the Board.

Therefore, in any case, it is the BOI which must determine the date of commencement of the tax exemption period, which must be specified in a certificate issued by the board. The BOI pursuant to that agreement has determined that the Respondent is entitled to the Tax Holiday period of 5 years commencing from 2003.04.01 to 2008.09.03.[emphasis added]

[56] Having perused the certificate which confirmed that the Respondent

complied with the investment criterion as required by clause 10 (1) of the

said agreement, the Court of Appeal held that the Respondent was entitled

for the tax holiday period of 5 years commencing from 01.04.2003 to

31.03.2008, His Lordship Surasena, J. held at page 16:

These facts clearly show that the year of assessment 1998/1999 is not qualified to be a year of tax exemption as it has not met any of the two requirements set out above. Therefore, the year of assessment 1998/1999 is not within the tax exemption period determined by the BOI. Thus, any profit that may have been made during that year becomes assessable

25

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

under the Act as the tax exemption does not apply to that year. Therefore, any loss that the Respondent had incurred in the year 1998/1999 could be deducted from the total statutory incomenas that amount of the loss could have been assessable under the Act if it had been a profit.

[57] The question involved in Setmil Developers Lanka (Pvt) Ltd v.

Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra) was the deductibility of the tax

losses incurred by the Appellant during the period of commercial

operations, but prior to the commencement of the tax exemption period

by carrying them forward to the subsequent year of assessment from the

previous year under section 32 (5) (a) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of

2006. While endorsing the decision of the Court of Appeal in Commissioner-

General of Inland Revenue v. Seylan Development PLC (supra), the Court of

Appeal in Setmil Developers Lanka (Pvt) Ltd v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue

(supra) held that the BOI must determine the project implementation

period and the date of the commencement of the tax exemption period. It

thus, held:

[47] Under such circumstances, I hold that it is the BOI that must determine the project implementation period and the date of the commencement of the tax exemption period, which must be specified in a certificate issued by the BOI having regard to the two rules set out in Clause 12 (i) of the Agreement. I further hold that it is the BOI that must determine whether or not the Appellant had met the investment criteria before determining whether or not the Appellant is entitled to the tax concessions referred to in Sub-Clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Clause 12 (i) of the Agreement.

[48] It is obvious that the BOI could not have determined that the Appellant had met the investment criterion and issued a certificate determining the tax exemption period before the lapse of (i) the period of 24 months from the date of the Agreement (Clause 6) and (ii) the extended project implementation period granted by the BOI (31.03.2009). [49] The period of 24 months set out in the Agreement for the project implementation was extended by the BOI and when the Appellant satisfied the minimum investment committed to the project during the extended project implementation period, the BOI decided by letter dated 07.06.2011 that the Appellant had met the investment criterion (p. 17). The BOI by the same letter determined that the Appellant was entitled to the first year of tax holiday, covering the period from 01.04.2009 to 31.03.2010 (2009/2010) and not prior to that year of assessment (2009/2010).

26

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

[58] The learned Deputy Solicitor General sought to distinguish the present

case from the two cases in Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue v. Seylan

Development PLC (supra) and Setmil Developers Lanka (Pvt) Ltd v

Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra) on the basis that the issue here is

not whether it is the BOI which has the power to decide what the tax

exemption period is, but whether or not the tax exemption periods already

decided by the BOI is valid or binding. As noted, the only document that

could determine the tax exemption period and the date of the

commencement of the tax exemption period is the tax certificate issued by

the BOI dated 24.12.2002 in terms of clause 10(vi) of the principal BOI

agreement. That tax exemption period cannot be decided solely on the

date of the first commercial production after the lower additional

investment criteria of Rs. 500 million was made on 01.04.1999.

[59] The learned Deputy Solicitor General however, heavily relied on the

decision of the Court of Appeal in Ceylon Steel Corporation Limited v.

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue CA/TAX/10/2010 & CA/TAX 18/2013

decided on 06.08.2015 in support of her argument that it is the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue that has the power and authority

to implement the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act, and the BOI has no

power whatsoever, to review the scope and the terms and conditions of the

BOI agreement. She relied on the following statement made by Chitrasiri J.

at page 10 of the said judgment:

More importantly, it is the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue that has the power and authority to implement the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act. He is not bound by the opinions expressed by the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka when it comes to determining tax liability under the law. Therefore, it is not incorrect to decide that the Board of Investment does not possess the power to review the scope and the terms and conditions of the Agreement . [60] A perusal of the said judgment reveals that the first question that arose

for determination was whether or not the tax exemption set out in clause

10(1) of the BOI agreement extended to income derived from import and

sale of stirrups, and the second isuue was whether the BOI posseses the

power to review the scope, the terms and conditions of agreements

entered into by the Appellant in the said case. His Lordship Chitrasiri J.

found on the first issue that the the tax exemption applied only to the

27

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

matters connected with modernization and upgrading the factory but the

import and sale of stirrups will have no bearing to modernize and upgrade

the factory and accordingly, the tax exemption does not extend to the

import and sale of stirrups. His Lordships observations at pp. 5-7 of the

judgment are as follows:

Consideration to afford the tax exemption by the BOI was kicked off, upon a request made by the appellant company by its letters dated 15.11.1096 and 01.04.1998. Requests made in those two letters were to seek approval to modernize and upgrade the companys existing factory at Athurugiriya. Therefor, the exemptions that were sought by the appellant could be applied only to the matters connected with moidernising and upgrading the factory at Athurigiriya of the appellant company. .

Needless to say that import and sale of stirrups will have no bearing to modernize and upgrade the appellnat s factory at Athurigiriya. Admiredly, the appellant company has made profits by importing and selling stirrups even though such an activity does not relate to modernize and upgrade the existing factory at Athurugiriya. Therefore, I must clearly mention that the tax exemptions referred to in clause 10(1) in the agreement 72 is applicable and also is restricted to the claims that do come within the purpose for which the very same agreement was executed.

Therefore, it is my considered view that the import and swle of stirrups by the appellant does not cover the purpose for which the agreement 72 was entered into. .Hence, it is clear that the exemptions referred to in the agreement bearing No. 72 does not extend to import and sale of stirrups since it has no bearinf to the very purpose of entering into thr agreement bearing No. 72. In the circumstances, it is my opinion that the exemption clause 10(1) in the agreement bearing No. 72 will not apply when detrminng tax liability of the appellant for the income derived from import and sale of stirrups. [61] On the second issue, His Lordship Chitrasiri J. found that the BOI in

interpreting the tax exemption in section 10 of the agreement expanded its

scope by including the import and sale of stirrups such as steel wire rods

which did not qualify for tax exemption under section 10. In the

circumstances, Chitrasiri J. observed that it is the Commissioner-General of

Inland Revenue that has the power and authority to implement the provisions

of the Inland Revenue Act. He is not bound by the opinions expressed by the

Board of Investment of Sri Lanka when it comes to determining the tax liability

under the law.

28

CA TAX 0018 2015 TAC OLD IT - 041

[62] In the instant case, the question arose whether the BOI could

determine the date of the commencement of the tax exemption period as

is specified in the certificate issued by the BOI in terms of clause 10(vi) of

the BOI agreement, or whether the tax exemption period referred to in the

supplementary agreement determines the date of the commencement of

the tax exemption period. It is crystal clear that the judgment of the Court

of Appeal in Ceylon Steel Corporation Limited v. Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue (supra) has no relevance to the facts of the present case,

and can be clearly distinguishable on its facts.

[63] In the circumstances, the TAC cannot be faulted in holding that (i) the

only document that could be considered as a certificate issued by the BOI

is the certificate issued by the Executive Director (Monitoring) dated

24.12.2002 after the higher additional investment requirement of Rs. 1,500

million was made as required by clause 10(vi) of the BOI agreement; and (ii)

the commencement of the tax exemption period commenced from

01.01.2001, and not from 01.04.1999.

[64] Accordingly, the losses claimed by the Respondent for the relevant

years of assessment shall be determined by the Appellant on the basis that

the 12 year tax exemption period has commenced from 01.01.2001. The

question as to how the losses claimed in the tax adjustment statement is

computed and its correctness should be decided by the Appellant as

determined by the TAC in its determination dated 15.10.2015.
