JUDGMENT

P.Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General under Sections 54(A) (d) and

54(A) (b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended

by Act No. 13 of 1984 for Possession and Trafficking respectively of 2.9 grams

of Heroin on 25th May 2003 in the High Court of Panadura.

After trial the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the Learned

High Court Judge of Panadura has imposed a sentence of life imprisonment

on her on the 08th of September 2017.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. During the argument she was connected via Zoom platform from

prison.

On behalf of the Appellant two Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. In the first ground of appeal the Appellant contends that

the prosecution has failed to prove that the production

was sealed after following accepted sealing procedure and

failed to prove its movement until it reached the

Government Analyst Department.

2. There is inter se contradictions between the prosecution

witnesses.

Facts of the case albeit briefly are as follows.

PW1 SI/Perera attached to the Moratuwa Police Station was on night patrol

duty along with a team of police officers on 25/05/2003. While they were at

Alwis Mawatha, Katubedde around 10.00 p.m., the Appellant was seen

walking towards the police officers but suddenly changed direction by

turning towards the Saman Place. PW1 having observed the change of

movement of the Appellant which he thought was suspicious, rushed at her

and stopped her to check. He had then observed a red coloured cloth, a part

of which was visible under her right-hand armpit. When PW1 pulled it out,

he had found a blue coloured grocery bag wrapped inside. A large number of

small packets packed in printed paper was found when the grocery bag was

opened. When PW1 opened a packet, he had found some substance in it

which reacted for Heroin. Then the Appellant was arrested immediately and

brought to the Moratuwa Police Station. At the police station the parcel was

opened and about 400 packets containing heroin were found to be held

within. After collecting all the Heroin on to a tissue paper it had been weighed

using an electronic scale. The weight has been recorded as 12000 milligrams.

The weight was noted including the tissue paper. The production was

properly sealed and sent to the Government Analyst Department for analysis.

According to the Government Analyst Report 2.9 grams of pure Heroin

(Diacetylmorphine) had been detected in the parcel.

The evidence given by PW1 has been properly corroborated by the other

police witnesses called by the prosecution.

After the closure of the prosecution case, the defence was called as the

Learned High Court Judge had observed that the prosecution had presented

a prima facie case against the Appellant and the Appellant had opted to give

evidence from the witness box and had proceeded to call witnesses.

In the first ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the prosecution has

failed to prove that the production was sealed after following accepted sealing

4 | P a g e

procedure and that the prosecution has failed to prove its movement until it

reached the Government Analyst Department.

In several judicial decisions delivered both by the Apex Court and the Court

of Appeal of our jurisdiction, one salient point stressed frequently is that the

inward journey of the productions in drugs related cases plays a decisive role

in the final outcome of the matter. If the inward journey evidence creates a

doubt, the failure of the prosecution case is inevitable. Hence, the chain of

the inward journey of the production plays a major role in matters related to

drugs. The inward journey begins with the detection, sealing, custody and

the conclusion by reaching the Government Analyst Department.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person. In a case of this nature

the prosecution does not only need to prove the case beyond reasonable

doubt but also ensure, with cogent evidence that the inward journey of the

production has not been disturbed at the all-material point.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 the court

held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences relation to drugs, we are of

the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions where the identity of the

good analysis for examination has to be proved beyond reasonable

doubt. A prosecutor should take pains to ensure that the chain of

events pertaining to the productions that had been taken charge from

the Appellant from the time it was taken into custody to the time it

reaches the Government Analyst and comes back to the court should

be established.

According to PW1, the detection was done without any information received

beforehand. The reason for the arrest of the Appellant was due to her sudden

5 | P a g e

suspicious movement as observed by PW1 and his team. The Heroin was

recovered from under her right armpit. After recovering the substance, the

Appellant was taken to Moratuwa Police Station for further investigations.

Until such time the production was in the custody of PW1. After coming to

the police station PW1 had collected all the substances from the packets on

to a tissue paper and weighed the same using an electronic scale. The total

weight including the tissue paper showed 12000 milligrams. The Appellant

was searched with the assistance of a female police officer to ensure that she

does not have any more substances in her possession. The weighing and

sealing were done in front of the Appellant. PW1 had used his personal seal

to seal the production and also obtained the fingerprint of the Appellant to

seal the production. The sealed productions were handed over to the reserve

police officer PC 6040 Lalith marked as (PR 57/03).

The Appellant was produced before the Learned Magistrate of Moratuwa on

26/05/2003. The production was taken to the Government Analyst

Department by PS 11038 Jayatilake on 05/06/2003.

PW2 Sgt/12085 Sirisena, had corroborated the evidence given by PW1

without any contradiction or omission. In his evidence he admitted that the

investigation revealed that the Appellant was a market vendor at Katubedde

Public Market.

The prosecution led evidence that production PR 57/03 was duly kept under

the care of reserve police officers until it reached the Government Analyst

Department. All reserve officers were called to give evidence to confirm that

the production pertaining to this case had reached the Government Analyst

Department without any break in the chain of production.

PW8 Assistant Government Analyst, Chandrani confirmed that the

production pertaining to this case had reached her department with all seals

intact. Government Analyst Sivaraja who was called as a defence witness too

6 | P a g e

confirmed that the seals of the production were intact when it reached his

department.

Proving detection, sealing and chain of custody are a very important task

entrusted to the prosecution in a drug related case. If investigating officers

do not do their duty properly, detection, sealing and chain of custody can be

successfully challenged during trial. This is because the prosecution always

relies on evidence gathered by police officers in cases of this nature.

In Perera V. Attorney General [1998] 1 Sri.L.R 378 it was held:

the most important journey is the inward journey because the final

analyst report will depend on that.

In Witharana Doli Nona v. The Republic of Sri Lanka CA/19/99 His

Lordship Justice Abrew remarked thus;

It is a recognized principle that in drug related cases the prosecution

must prove the chain relating to the inward journey. The purpose of this

principle is to establish that the productions have not been tampered

with. Prosecution must prove that the productions taken from the

accused Appellant was examined by the Government Analyst

In this case, although the Appellant contends that the productions were not

sealed according to the accepted procedure by the police, all prosecution

witnesses vividly explained without any contradictions or omissions that the

production which reached the Government Analyst Department had been

properly sealed. Hence the argument advanced by the Appellant under the

first ground of appeal has no merit.

In the second ground of appeal the Appellant argues that there is inter se

contradictions between the prosecution witnesses.

The Appellant in her evidence admitted that she was arrested on

25/05/2003 and brought to the Moratuwa Police Station and that her

fingerprint was obtained on to an envelope. But she denied that she

7 | P a g e

possessed Heroin at the time of arrest as claimed by the prosecution. During

her evidence a number of questions had been asked from her by her

Attorney-at-Law with regard to the personal seal of PW1.

Although the Appellant was subjected to numerous questions with regard to

the personal seal of PW1, the defence failed to direct those questions to the

most relevant person, PW1. Further the appellant in her evidence complaints

that she was subjected to torture and duress while at the Moratuwa Police

Station, but she had failed to lodge a complaint to the appropriate authority,

including the Learned Magistrate before whom she was produced several

times before being indicted in the High Court of Panadura.

Defence witness No.2, the Registrar of the High Court of Panadura was

summoned by the defence to prove that the sending of production pertaining

to this case to the Government Analyst Department and receiving of the

receipt and the Government Analyst report.

PW8 Chandrani, the Assistant Government Analyst in her evidence stated

that the production pertaining to this case was directly received from the

police. As a routine practice she had checked the seals with the specimen

seal and accepted the production and issued a receipt which had been

marked as P10.

According to her the covering letter sent by the Officer-in-Charge of

Moratuwa Police Station had mentioned that the weight of the Heroin was

12000 milligrams (12 grammes). When the parcel was first weighed as it is,

it showed 12.84 grammes. The defence did not ask any question regarding

this discrepancy in weight. (0.84 grammes) The brown coloured substances

weighed about 9.8 grammes. After the analysis of the brown coloured

substances the Government Analyst had extracted 2.9 grammes of pure

Heroin. The prosecution had proved the Government Analyst Report without

any contradiction.

8 | P a g e

The defence witness PW3, who was the Government Analyst and co-signed

the report had corroborated the evidence of PW8.

As the evidence presented by the prosecution with regard to the detection,

sealing and forwarding for analysis sans any contradiction or ambiguity, I

conclude that the appellant is not successful in his second ground of appeal

too.

In this case evidence pertaining to the detection of Heroin from the appellant

is clear, cogent and without any contradiction or omission. The evidence

presented by the prosecution is not challenged at any material point. Hence

no fault had occurred at any stage of the trial.

The Court of Appeal in Bandara v. The State C.A. 27/99 held that:

when there is ample opportunity to contradict the evidence of

a witness but is not impugned or assailed in cross-examination

that is a special fact and feature in the case, it is a matter falling

within the definition of the word proof in section 3 of the

Evidence Ordinance and a trial judge or court must necessarily

take the fact in to consideration in adjudicating the issue before

it.

In Ukkuwa v. The Attorney General [2002] 3 SLR 279, is a case where

Justice S. Tilakawardene held that matters of fact that could have been

challenged and clarified at the Trial Court are precluded from being

challenged at the Appellate Court in the following manner at page 282;

court is mindful of the fact that having had the opportunity to cross-

examine the witness before the original court and having failed or

neglected to avail himself of the opportunity of such examination on

these matters which could have been clarified, had such objections or

cross-examination being raised in the original court, the counsel is

9 | P a g e

precluded from challenging so the veracity of such matters of fact before

this court.

The Learned High Court Judge had accurately analysed and considered the

evidence presented by both parties and arrived at a proper finding.

Considering all the evidence presented during the trial, I conclude that the

prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. I further conclude

that this is not an appropriate case in which to interfere with the decision of

the Learned High Court judge of Panadura dated 08/09/2017.

Hence, the appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court

of Panadura along with the original case record.
