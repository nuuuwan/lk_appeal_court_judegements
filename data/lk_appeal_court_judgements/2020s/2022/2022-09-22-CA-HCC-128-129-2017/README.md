N. Bandula Karunarathna J.

This appeal is from the judgment, delivered by the learned Judge of the High Court of Ampara, dated 07.06.2017, by which, the 1st and 3rd accused-appellants, who are before this Court, were convicted and sentenced to death for having murdered Ganapathipillai Kumaraswami and Kumaraswami Thanganayagam alias Sellaiya Ranganayagam. The indictment dated 02.03.2009 was served on the appellants on 31.08.2009.

The 2nd accused was not alive to face the charges levelled against him whereas the 1st and 3rd accused persons pleaded not guilty to the charges against them and elected a jury trial whereupon proceedings commenced accordingly. Until 10.08.2015 the accused were not provided with a Sinhala-speaking jury and the matter was postponed on several instances due to lack of space in the Court Room to accommodate a Jury.

Since the matter had continuously been postponed due to various reasons the learned counsel for the accused-appellants moved that the accused be tried before the learned High Court Judge instead of a jury. The said application was allowed by the learned High Court Judge and the trial commenced. In the indictment, 43 charges were levelled against the appellants under sections 296,300,146 and 419 of the Penal Code read with section 32 of the Penal Code.

The appellants were only convicted for charges 24 and 27 and were acquitted from all the other charges against them.

Charge No.24 is as follows;

that on or about 23.09.1997 within the jurisdiction of this Court, at Central Camp you along with the deceased Abesekara Wannaku Arachchige Wasantha Kumara (2nd accused person) and several others unknown to the prosecution committed the

Page 3 of 18

murder of one Ganapadhipillai Kumaraswami which is an offence punishable under section 32 reads with the section 296 of the Penal Code."

Charge No.27 is as follows;

that on or about 23.09.1997 within the jurisdiction of this Court, at Central Camp you along with the deceased Abesekara Wannaku Arachchige Wasantha Kumara (2nd accused person) and several others unknown to the prosecution committed the murder of one Thanganayagam alias Sellaiya Ranganayagam which is an offence punishable under section 32 reads with the section 296 of the Penal Code"

Witnesses Kalikutti Thangapillei (PW 4) and Welayudam Perimbaraja (PW 5) were not alive during the trial and their evidence given at the non-summary inquiry (10869/NS/97) were adopted under section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance, through the Court Interpreter Mudliyar. At the end of the prosecution's case, no witnesses were called by the defence. However, the 1st and the 3rd accused persons made dock statements and concluded their case.

After hearing oral submissions from both parties, the learned High Court Judge fixed the matter for judgement and it was delivered on 07.06.2017. By that judgment dated 07.06.2017, the accused-appellants were acquitted from 41 charges but convicted for charges No 24 and 27 in the indictment as aforesaid and sentenced to death. Being aggrieved by the

Page 4 of 18

said conviction and sentence of the learned High Court Judge of Ampara, the accused-appellants filed the instant appeal.

It is important to note that, 18 witnesses gave evidence on behalf of the prosecution. Only PW 1 and PW 5 gave direct evidence against the appellants. In his oral submissions, it was admitted by the learned State Counsel that this case is solely based on the evidence of PW 1 and the other witnesses were summoned only to prove the background of the case and to prove the damages caused to the property.

The prosecution's main witness was Ganeshan Ravindran (PW 1) and he stated that this incident happened on 23.09.1997 when he was only 16 years old. While he, his parents and his younger brother were at home, around 2.00 pm they had heard gunshots from outside and when they had gone out to look they had seen about 50 policemen setting fire to the houses. He stated that about 3 people came near their gate and called all the family members near the gate. The 3rd accused person had assaulted him and the 2nd accused person had shot his mother's leg (Thanganayagam alias Sellaiva Ranganayagam) and father's head (Ganapadhipillai Kumaraswami).

Being frightened by the said actions of these people, his younger brother had run towards the banana trees and thereafter he had also fled the scene. On the following day, he identified the bodies of his parents at Kalmunai hospital and the funeral was done at the Senakuduirippu village. He stated that before giving evidence at the High Court, he was summoned before the Magistrate Court of Kalmunai and had participated in several identification parades and was able to identify three people connected to the alleged incident which happened on 23.09.1997. In his evidence-in-chief and his cross-examination, for the questions raised by both counsel the witness has answered that it was the 2nd accused who shot his parents and he was not present in the High Court.

Welayudam Perimbaraja (PW 5) was not alive during the trial and his evidence given at the non-summary trial (10869/NS/97) was adopted as per section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance and that evidence was recorded through the interpreter mudliyar. In his testimony at the non-summary trial (10869/NS/97) he had stated that this incident happened on 23.09.1997 between 1.00 pm and 2.00 pm wherein he had heard gunshots and a commotion and had gone towards the scene. According to him, 20 to 25 policemen from the Central Camp Police Station were setting fire to houses and shooting people. He had further stated that four people in police uniform had come towards him and he was shot twice. The person who fired during the particular incident was not among the accused persons, present in Court. In his evidence, he had further testified that he was summoned to the identification parade held at the Magistrates Court, although the accused were present in the parade, he had feared to identify the accused during the identification parade.

Dr. K. Muruganandan (PW 21) testified in the High Court and said that he was the District Medical Officer who was attached to the Kalmunai hospital on 24.09.1997 and conducted the autopsy of Ganapadhipillai Kumaraswami and Thanganayagam alias Sellaiya Ranganayagam. The relevant autopsy reports were marked through this witness as P 2 and P 4. In his evidence, it was revealed that both the bodies were identified by Ganeshan Ravindran (PW 1) who was the son of the deceased and according to his autopsy report the deaths were caused due to fatal injuries to the brain, loss of blood and convulsion caused by gunshots.

Godewatta Arachchige Sundarapala (OIC, Police Station, Central Camp) (PW 24) was the officer in charge of the Central Camp Police Station during this period. In his evidence- in- chief and his cross-examination, he had stated that the alleged first incident took place in the night of 23.09.1997. In his re-examination, he had stated that it was during noon that this present incident happened. He had also stated that during the period concerned there were around 600 policemen under his command and the accused were among them. According to him the 1st accused was assigned to the minor offences branch and the 3rd accused was trained to activate the generator in case of sudden terrorist attacks. Further in his evidence, it was revealed that both the 2nd and 3rd accused were on duty at the police station during the night of 23.09.1997.

He had further stated that firearms like T56, S 84 and SLR were issued to the police officers during that period. Although the police asked for a government analyst report to identify the nexus between bullets found at the crime scene and the firearms issued, no government analyst report was issued regarding this incident. All the police officers who were attached to the central camp police station on 23.09.1997 were confronted with identification parades held at Magistrates Court Kalmunai and only these accused were identified by the witnesses.

Wijayantha Bandara (Police Officer) PW 31 was one of the investigating officers who went to Kalmunai hospital with the Chief Investigating Officer Nandadasa (PW 25) who was not alive at the time of the trial. He, had stated that at the hospital he took statements from three witnesses and PW 1 was among them. It was revealed from the cross-examination that in the statement given by PW 1 there was no mention of the identification of the assailants or his ability to identify the accused persons.

As the learned Counsel for the accused persons admitted the holding of the three identification parades relevant to this matter, the reports of such parades were marked and produced without calling the witnesses who conducted the said parades. After the case for the prosecution, the two accused persons gave statements from the dock and concluded their defence case.

The 1st accused person gave a dock statement and stated that he worked at the Central Camp Police Station for 6 years and he is married to one Shriyani Jayanthi Kumari who resides at No. CC 21, in front of the Central Camp Police Station. He was known to the villagers as a policeman and that is how he was identified at the identification parade. He further stated that he had no connection to this crime and on 23.09.1997 he worked at the Central Camp Police Station assigned to the minor offences branch and he had made his notes regarding the official duties done by him on 23.09.1997.

The 3rd accused person gave his dock statement and stated that he worked at the Central Camp Police Station for 5 years and on 21.10.1998 he was transferred to Vavuniya and on 20.09.1999 he was summoned for an identification parade almost two years after the alleged incident and he was identified thereafter. He further stated that he had no connection to this incident.

On behalf of the 1st accused-appellant, learned Presidents Counsel argued whether the identification of the accused was properly constituted during the trial. He argued that the identification parade held at the Magistrate's Court was not conducted properly and the

Page 6 of 18

prosecution failed to follow the proper procedure regarding the identification parade. Among other witnesses, only PW 1 identified the appellant but after confirming the identification by PW 1 he was never asked about the actions committed by the appellant pertaining to the alleged incident which is a fatal error done by the prosecution.

In the case of Abeysekera vs. The Attorney Generals 1981 (1) SLR 376 it was held the importance of an identification parade was as follows;

"Identification parades are held to enable persons to identify suspects who had not been known to them earlier. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the identifying witnesses should be called as witnesses at the trial and asked the specific question as to whom they identified at the earlier parade. The best evidence is not obtained by simply asking the officer who held the identification parade to testify as to who identified whom."

It was further argued that after the identification parade the appellants objected to the parade by raising the concern that they were taken to the parade uncovered and the witnesses had the opportunity to see them before the parade. The learned High Court Judge never considered this objection in his judgment. It was revealed from the evidence at the trial that the appellants were known to PW 1 and the other villagers even before the identification parade was held as policemen at the Central Camp Police Station who are residing in the same village. However, this fact has never been considered by the learned Trial Judge.

Dock statement of the 1st accused appellant at page 379 of the brief is as follows;

The Counsel for the defence admitted the parade notes and marked them as admissions under section 420 of the Criminal Procedure Code. On behalf of the 1st accused-appellant, learned President's Counsel submitted that even though the parade notes were admitted, it doesnt mean that the identification parade itself is admitted by the appellants. Therefore, his argument was that the learned High Court Judge had erroneously considered this admission as an admission of the identification of the appellant and delivered his judgement erroneously.

It was revealed from the evidence of PW 1 that the appellant was known to him even before the alleged incident but had failed to make any statement in this regard in his 1st statement at the Kalmunai hospital. The learned Presidents Counsel stated that this has ultimately impeached the credibility of the identification made by PW 1.

Evidence of PW 31 who was the investigating officer who recorded the statement at hospital at page 333 of the brief is as follows;

The defects which prevailed in the identification parade notes which were admitted by the defence proved that the police has failed to conduct a proper identification parade. Further, the learned Presidents Counsel submitted that since the accused were known to the witnesses even before the alleged incident took place, the parade serves no useful purpose and has no evidential value. It is further submitted by the learned Presidents Counsel that due to the aforementioned defects, the identification is reduced to a mere dock identification, which ultimately questions the proper identification of the appellant.

It is important to note that the concept of dock identification was broadly discussed in Kokmaduwa Mudalige Premachandra and Two Others vs Attorney General CA-HCC 39-41/1997 where Justice F.N.D Jayasuriya held that;

"Justice Wijesundara in Gunarathna Banda's case (an unreported decision) which is referred to by the author E.R.S.R Coomaraswamy, Law of Evidence Volume (I), has referred to a series of English and foreign judgements where the view has been expressed that it is against prudence and wisdom to proceed against an accused person in a criminal case on mere dock identification. Justice Wijesundara has followed this development of the law in foreign jurisdictions and recommended to the Trial Judges that they should adopt this rule which prevails in a foreign jurisdiction. In the circumstances, we set aside the findings conviction and sentence, imposed on the 3rd accused-appellant and acquit the third accused."

Page 8 of 18

The identification of an assailant and connecting him with the crime after a fair trial is an integral element of a criminal trial. E.R.S.R Coomaraswamy in his work Law of Evidence quoted both R Vs Orton and Wills regarding the issue of identification as follows:

"A party's identity with an ascertained person may arise both in civil and criminal cases. The question of identity is particularly important in criminal cases. Identity may be proved or disproved by direct testimony or opinion evidence or presumptively by circumstantial evidence. Criminal law insists on proper identification. Cases have shown that what is supposed to be the clearest intimation of the sense, is sometimes fallacious and defective"

Whereas in R Vs Turnbull (1977) Q.B. 224, the court held as follows:

Whenever the case of an accused person depends wholly or substantially on the correctness of one or more identifications of the accused which the defence alleges to be mistaken, the Judge should warn the jury of the special need for caution before convicting in reliance on the correctness of the identification.

He should instruct them as the reason for that warning and should make some reference to the possibility that a mistake. Witness could be a convincing one and that several witnesses could all be mistaken.

Further, in the decided case Wijepala vs The Attorney-General 2001 (2) SLR 45, it was decided that;

"The evidence of the sole eye witness raised a strong doubt as to the guilt of the appellant and the court should have given the benefit of that doubt to the appellant."

The learned Presidents Counsel argued that as supported by the case law mentioned above there is reasonable doubt regarding the identification of the appellant which the learned High Court Judge had failed to consider.

It is important to note whether the common intention of the accused has been properly evaluated. Under section 32 of the Penal Code, common intention is defined as follows;

"When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such person is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone".

To prove common intention, the prosecution has to prove participatory presence, prearrangement and the sharing of the murderous intention of the accused-appellant. Whereas in the instant case, the prosecution failed to do so but the learned High Court Judge without evaluating any evidence pertaining to the common intention erroneously imposed liability on the appellant under section 32 of the Penal Code. This wrongful evaluation of evidence by the learned High Court Judge can be demonstrated as follows;

Page 456 of the appeal brief is as follows;

. .

Page 9 of 18

. .

In Raju and Others v A.G 2003 (3) SLR 116, Justice Edirisuriya widely discussed the law pertaining to common intention and held as follows;

"It seems to me that the learned Trial Judge has failed to refer to the required mental element which is the murderous intention to constitute the offence of murder. In the case of King vs Assappu 16 NLR 413, Dias J. sitting with Nagalingam, J. and Gratiaen, J. held that in a case where the question of common intention arises the Jury must be directed that

(i) The case of each accused must be considered separately. (ii) The accused must have been actuated by a common intention with the doer

of the act at the time the offence was committed. (iii) The common intention must not be confused with the same or similar

intention entertained independently of each other. (iv) There must be evidence either direct or circumstantial of pre-arrangement or

some other evidence of common intention. (v) The mere fact of the presence of the accused at the time of the offence is not

necessarily evidence of common intention.

Justice Sirimanne in the case of Punchi Banda vs The Queen 2003 (3) SLR 116 refers to the legal principle laid down in King vs Assappu (supra) that a common murderous intention must be shared before a person can be convicted of murder on an application of section 32 of the Penal Code."

It is established law that the prosecution has to prove the participatory presence, prearrangement and sharing of murderous intention among the accused to establish the common intention under section 32 of the Penal Code. Whereas in this instant case, the learned High Court Judge had erred in law by considering the mere presence of the appellant as the common intention of the appellant.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st accused-appellant submits that the actus reus of the appellant has not been established properly. In this matter, the prosecution failed to establish the common intention of the appellant. Therefore, it is mandatory to prove both the mens rea and the actus reus of each accused separately to impose criminal liability on them.

In order to establish a criminal case, the prosecution has to establish the basic elements of a crime and without proving the physical element of a crime a conviction cannot stand. In this instance, with regard to the 1st accused-appellant no direct or indirect evidence was produced to prove any action committed by him. Whereas the following portions of evidence make clear that the actus reus of the 1st accused-appellant was not properly established by the prosecution.

Careful consideration of the judgment shows that the learned High Court Judge had wrongly evaluated the evidence in his judgment. Some factual findings used by the learned Trial Judge in his judgment never emanated from the evidence at the trial although those facts were included in his judgment.

Page 471 of the appeal brief is as follows;

32 , .

This fact regarding the 1st accused-appellant assaulting the PW 1 was never revealed from the evidence of the trial. However, PW 1 in his evidence directly testified that the 1st accused-appellant was merely present at the scene and it is the 3rd accused-appellant who assaulted him.

Page 11 of 18

The learned High Court Judge erroneously included these unproved facts in his judgment.

He considered the admission of the identification parade notes under section 420 of the Criminal Procedure Code as an admission of the identity of the appellant and confers his judgement based on that wrongful premise. This is reflected in the following portion of the evidence.

Admission of the parade notes by the defence on page 231 of the appeal brief is as follows;

The judgement of the learned High Court Judge on page 479 of the appeal brief is as follows;

The following sentence shows that wrongful evaluation done by the learned High Court Judge ultimately unfairly prejudices the appellant. Page 470 of the appeal brief is as follows;

.

It was the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel that in this matter a weak investigation was conducted by the investigating officers. Even a government analyst report was never produced in Court. However, without giving such an advantage to the defence, the learned High Court Judge has erroneously considered those unproven facts as established facts, in his judgement.

When considering the above 2 sentences it is very clear that the learned High Court Judge created a wrongful nexus between the deaths and the appellant without any supportive evidence and made a serious error in his judgement.

Page 12 of 18

Another argument raised by the learned Presidents Council on behalf of the 1st accused-appellant was that the learned High Court Judge has not properly evaluated the dock statement made by the appellant.

The appellant gave a reasonable explanation regarding his identification at the identification parade by PW 1 and it corroborates with the evidence of PW 1. However, the learned High Court Judge has failed to properly evaluate the dock statement in his judgement.

The dock statement, at page 379 of the appeal brief is as follows;

. .. . .

This version of the appellant is corroborated by the evidence of the PW 1.

In Ariyadasa Vs Queen 68 CLW 97, T.S Fernando J held as follows;

if the jury believed the accused evidence he is entitled to be acquitted; accused is also entitled to be acquitted even his evidence, though not believed was

such that it causes the jury entertain a reasonable doubt in regard to his guilt.

In Martin Vs Queen 69 CLW 21 T.S Fernando J held as follows;

"Even if the jury declined to believe the appellants version, he was yet entitled to acquit on the charge if his version raised in the mind of the Jury a reasonable doubt as to the truth of the prosecutions case.

In the case of Dayananda Lokugalappaththi v The State 2003 (3) SLR 362 the Court of Appeal held that;

... in respect of an alibi what is expected of the defence is merely to create a doubt in the mind of the court, if the alibi is accepted or even if it is not accepted yet if there is a doubt created in the judges mind, the prosecution shall fail. The trial judge has considered the defence evidence of alibi and weighed it in the balance with the prosecution evidence and has rejected it ..."

It is my view that the learned High Court judge has failed to weigh the evidence of alibi against that of the prosecution and as such failed to consider whether a doubt has been caused by the accused-appellant with regard to his presence at the time of the commission of the alleged offence which is a complete violation of the law.

Another important argument was raised by the learned counsel for the 3rd accused-appellant. It is the suspicious circumstances under which the accused were initially made suspects, in this case, that has not been correctly evaluated by the learned Trial Judge. There had been 3 separate Identification parades within a span of 2 years of the incident. Identification of the accused in the said parades could be summarized below.

1st parade which was held on 23.10.1997, Ranpattige Gamini Kumarasinghe was identified by P.W 01

2nd parade which was held on 26.10.1998 (after one year)

Wannakku Arachchige Wasantha Kumara was identified by a witness. But in the report, it was not mentioned by whom.

3rd parade which was held on 20.09.1999 (after two years) Nimal Karunarathna was identified by P.W 01.

It was revealed that none of the witnesses had named any suspect in their statements to the police.

Therefore, according to PW 25, ASP Sundarapala who was in-charge of the investigation, all 600 police officers who were at the police camp were "listed for Identification parades.

Page 14 of 18

Page 306 of the appeal brief is as follows;

: ?

: 600 .

.

: 600 ?

: 600 .

.

Witness PW 25 further stated that he was transferred out 3 days after the incident and does not know what happened to the planned parades.

Page 307 of the appeal brief is as follows;

. . . . 600 . . .

Under the said circumstances, a serious question arises as to how only the 6 suspects were chosen out of the equally eligible 600 candidates to be produced at the above three identification parades. It is evident that only three parades have been conducted. There is no explanation as to why it took 2 years to complete the three parades. There is also no explanation as to how only 4-5 witnesses were chosen for each parade. What should have been done was to produce all 600 police officers, even in batches for separate identification parades at which all witnesses could have been given opportunities to identify the perpetrators. Therefore, a grave suspicion arises about whether the investigating authorities have used the accused to close the investigations and whether the purported identification could have been set up. The learned Trial Judge has failed to evaluate the vital effect of the illegality in choosing the accused persons and three others as suspects without any evidence.

The 3rd Identification parade should have been rejected totally by the trial judge for two reasons.

(i) It was held after an unexplained lapse of 2 years from the incident. (ii) The failure to question and record from the witness as to the conduct of the identified

suspect at the alleged incident.

Mandatory requirements for an Identification parade have been well settled in law as per the following authorities.

Roshan Vs Attorney General 2011 (1) SLR 365

The identification parade, if it is to be of value, must be held at the earliest

opportunity, so that the impression of the witness remains fresh in his mind and he does not have the chance of comparing notes with others.

Page 15 of 18

The witness must be questioned and his description according to his recollection of

the perpetrator extracted and recorded before he is invited to examine the parade and point out the perpetrator. In view of the provisions in Article 13(3) of the Constitution recognizing the right of an

accused person to a fair trial by a competent court, evidence of improper identification must be excluded if the court is of the view that its admission would have an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings.

Perera Vs the State 77 NLR 224

The proper procedure that the magistrate should have adopted is as follows;

That the Magistrate should have held several parades He should have asked the particular witness to identify any suspect if he was in the

parade If a witness pointed out any person, then only Magistrate should ask the witness

whether that accused whom he pointed, out did anything. If so the details of what he did

AG Vs Weerahenndige Joseph 1992 (2) SLR 264 the proper procedure stated by Walgampaya J (in Perera vs state) should be taken as the laying down of the inflexible rules that should apply in all situations, any breach of which will result in evidence of the parade being excluded.

As held in Bati Ahir 1983 CriLJ 434 (SC); If there is no explanation for the delay, the accused could not be convicted.

In Soni 1983 SCC CriLJ 49; An identification parade held after 42 days was doubtful and hence the conviction was improper.

The learned Trial Judge has failed to correctly evaluate the credibility of the identification of the accused persons by PW 1.

Page 468 of the appeal brief is as follows;

" .

Due to the following circumstances, serious doubt is created as to whether PW1 actually witnessed the commission of the alleged crimes or whether he had fled the scene at the beginning and later found out the plight of his parents.

PW 1 states in his evidence that he witnessed his deceased mother being shot in the leg.

Page 175 of the appeal brief is as follows;

: . .

Page 16 of 18

: . .

This position taken by PW 1 is totally contradicted by the medical evidence. According to the post mortem report of the mother (marked as P 3) and evidence of PW 21 (the JMO) who conducted the post mortem, it was revealed that there had been no fire arm injury on her leg.

Three police officers had given evidence, apparently, none of them had visited the crime scene pertaining to charges no 24 and 27. No notes or sketches had been produced in evidence to show where the bodies of the deceased were found. Hence, there is no corroboration to the fact that the crimes concerned had taken place near the gate of the house belonging to PW 1, as alleged by him. The learned Trial Judge has considered the fact that the accused were well known to PW 1 and that he could have had no difficulty in identifying them. He has failed to consider the fact that PW 1 has mentioned in his statement given to the police that he is unable to identify the perpetrators. No explanation has been offered by PW 1 in this regard.

It was decided in Subash & Shanker 1987 Cri Lv 991, where an identification parade was held about 4 months after the date of occurrence and the eye witness had not given any descriptive particulars of the accused either in the first information report or in their statements during the investigation. It would be unsafe to base the conviction solely on such identification and the accused was entitled to the benefit of the doubt.

All witnesses (except PW 5) who had resided near the police camp for so many years had, even at the trial before the High Court, failed to identify the accused persons. Some of them stated that all the attackers had come with their faces covered with nets, thus creating a doubt as to why only the three people who had attacked the house of PW 1 had not covered their faces. On the other hand, it may be that PW 1 had not seen the attackers. The learned trial Judge has failed to consider the infirmities in the identification of the accused persons by PW 1 and failed to evaluate his credibility as the sole eye witness to the crimes on charges number 24 and number 27.

It is important to note that PW 5 has stated that all accused persons and the other person who came to his house were wearing police uniforms.

This position of PW 5 contradicts with all other witnesses including PW 1, who say that all the attackers came in plain clothes. This shatters the credibility of PW5 as an interested witness who had introduced new material to his testimony. The defence has had no opportunity to cross-examine him in the trial before the High Court due to his demise. On the other hand, if PW 5 is assumed truthful, then doubt is again created that PW 1 may have not seen the accused persons.

PW 5 has said in the non-summary inquiry that although he identified all accused persons at the identification parades, he did not indicate so due to fear. The learned Trial Judge has accepted this position. However, it is pertinent to note that the said witness PW5 Velayudan Perimparaja has not been a witness in the (3rd) Identification Parade in which the 3rd accused was produced. Therefore, the learned counsel for the 3rd accused-appellant argued that the credibility of PW5 is shaken as far as his identification of the 3rd accused is concerned. The said PW5 is not an eyewitness to the incidents relating to charges number 24 and 27 and his evidence cannot be relied on, against the accused persons.

In many places in the judgement of the learned Trial Judge, has indicated that the alleged attack has been carried out by a group of police officers attached to the Police Station due to a killing of a police officer a few days prior to the incident. This could be considered a baseless assumption for the reason that none of the witnesses has supported this theory. The only evidence available was that a police officer was killed at Chawalakade Road, Dadayanthalawa which is 4 Kilo Meters away from the village colony in question. It is also pertinent to note that apart from PW 1 and PW 5 who have testified to the effect that the attackers were police officers from Police Station, none of the other witnesses has corroborated that fact even after so many years.

The bullets and empty cartridges found in the village cannot be directly connected to Police Station since there have been several armed groups in that area including armed forces and LTTE during that time. In any event, it is prudent to remind again that there is no evidence adduced of finding any bullets, spent cartridges or capsules from the crime scene of the house of PW1, which is relevant to this case.

Therefore, apart from the evidence of PW 1 and PW 5, which is questionable on credibility as shown above, there is no other material to ascertain that the attackers were from Police Station. Under the above circumstances, in convicting the accused-appellants for counts number 24 and number 27 of the indictment, the learned Trial Judge has, failed to consider that the identification of the said accused has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution.

In the aforesaid, the identification of the appellants was not properly established and it is unsafe to uphold the conviction of the 1st and 3rd accused-appellants. The prosecution was failed to prove the basic elements of a crime namely, actus-reus and mens rea or the common

intention relating to the appellants. The dock statements made by the appellants were not properly evaluated by the learned High Court Judge. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the above matters and there are serious misdirections with regard to the burden of proof and evaluating the evidence of the prosecution.

The case against the accused-appellants were not proven beyond reasonable doubt and the conviction is not within the well-established principles of law as enumerated above. On the premises aforementioned, this Court sets aside the judgement dated 07.06.2017, whereby the accused-appellants were convicted and sentenced to death and now pronounces a fresh judgment of acquittal from all charges in the indictment, including charge numbers 24 and 27.

Appeal allowed.
