Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the accused appellant (herein after referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence imposed on him

by the Learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Embilipitiya for the offence

of attempted murder of one Godawatte Liyanage Gnanawathi on 06-07-2010, an

offence punishable in terms of Section 300 of the Penal Code.

After trial, the appellant was found guilty as charged, and the Learned High

Court Judge after hearing both the parties on the sentence, imposed a term of

four years rigorous imprisonment to the accused and a fine of Rs 5000/-, in

default of 3 months simple imprisonment. In addition to the fine, the appellant

was ordered to pay Rs 150000/- as compensation to the victim, in default, twelve

months simple imprisonment.

At the hearing of this appeal the Learned Counsel for the appellant informed the

Court that he is not canvasing the conviction and only making submissions with

regard to the sentence.

Accordingly, the appeal against the conviction was dismissed and the learned

Counsel for the appellant as well as the Learned Senior State Counsel (SSC) for

the Respondent Attorney-General were heard with regards to the sentence.

The victim Godawatte Liyanage Gnanawathi (PW-01) was the mother-in-law of

the appellant. On the day of the incident the appellant has visited the house of

the PW-01 and has informed her that his wife (daughter of PW-01) has eloped

with some other person. Hearing the news, PW-01 has shown her sympathy

towards the appellant and has even provided him with meals. However, after

some time the appellant has attacked PW-01 from behind using an axe and has

runway from the scene of the crime. The attack has caused injuries to her neck

area.

The evidence reveals that as a result of the attack, PW-01 was suffering for a

long time and still she has to depend on her husband for her day-to-day affairs.

She being a manual labourer at the time of the attack, was not being able to

work and earn a living even at the time of her giving evidence in the High Court.

After the conviction, the learned Counsel who appeared for the appellant has

pleaded before the learned High Court Judge in mitigation and has stated that

the appellant was 60 years old with three children and a farmer by profession

and also that he has no previous convictions. The learned Counsel in making

submissions before this Court also reiterated the same mitigatory circumstances

and pleaded that given the circumstances, this Court may consider suspending

the sentence imposed upon him.

In the case of Ravij Vs. State of Rajastan (1996) 2 SCC 175 it was held that:

It is the nature and gravity of the crime and not the criminal which are

germane for consideration of appropriate punishment in a criminal case.

The court will be failing in duty if appropriate punishment is not awarded

for a crime which has been committed not only against the individual victim

but also against the society to which the criminal and victim belong.

In M. Gomes Vs. W.V.D Leelaratne 66 NLR 233 it was stated that:

A Judge in determining the proper sentence should first consider the gravity

of the offence as it appears from the nature of the act itself. Should have

regards to the punishment provided in the Penal Code or the Statute under

which he is charged.

When the sentence imposed upon the accused by the learned High Court Judge

is considered, it needs to be mentioned that for an offence of this nature where

the offender has caused serious injuries to the victim, he shall be liable to an

imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 20 years and

shall also be liable to a fine.

Given the facts and the circumstances of this case, this Court is of the view that

the term of imprisonment imposed by the learned High Court Judge to the

appellants is very much adequate. In imposing the sentence, the Learned High

Court Judge has considered the mitigatory circumstances as well as the gravity

of the offence. Hence, this Court finds no reason to interfere with the sentence

of the learned High Court Judge.

The appeal against the sentence is dismissed as this Court finds no merit in the

appeal. The conviction and the sentence affirmed.
