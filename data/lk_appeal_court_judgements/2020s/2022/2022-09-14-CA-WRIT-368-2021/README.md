1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents- 24.08.2022

Decided on : 14.09.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner has filed this application seeking, inter alia, for a mandate in the nature of

a writ of Certiorari quashing the Certificate dated 19.08.2020, marked P30, filed by the

2nd Respondent in the Magistrates Court of Badulla in case No.36410. The said impugned

Certificate has been issued under Section 19 of the Finance Statute No. 8 of 1990 of the

Uva Province. The 2nd Respondent by the said Certificate has informed the relevant

Magistrates Court that the Petitioner has defaulted a sum of Rs.7,917,000.00, the payment

due to be recovered as stamp duty and fine, in view of the Deed of Transfer No. 308,

marked P4.

On the day the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner supported this application

for issuance of formal notice on the Respondents, two preliminary objections were raised

by the learned State Counsel who appears for the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents. The

objections are as follows;

Page 3 of 11

i. this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the application of the Petitioner as the

subject matter of this application is a devolved subject under the 13th Amendment

to the Constitution and accordingly, the Petition should have been filled in the High

Court of the Uva Province in terms of Article 154P(4)(b) of the Constitution.

ii. the Petitioner is guilty of suppression and has not come to Court with clean hands.

Before I proceed to decide on the issuance of formal notice, by this Court on the

Respondents, I must first dispose of the preliminary objection on jurisdiction raised by the

learned State Counsel.

The 13th Amendment to the Constitution1 came into effect in 1987 and the Provincial

Council Act No. 42 of 1987 was enacted in order to establish Provincial Councils in the

country. In terms of the Article 154P(1) there shall be a High Court for each Province with

effect from the date on which the Chapter XVII A of the Constitution comes in to force

and each such High Court shall be designated as the High Court of the relevant Province.

(hereinafter referred to as the Provincial High Court). The Provincial High Court has

jurisdiction in terms of Article 154P(4)(b) of the Constitution to issue, according to law,

(b) order in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition, procedendo, mandamus and quo

warranto against any person exercising, within the Province, any power under -

i. any law; or

ii. any statutes made by the Provincial Council established for that Province,

in respect of any matter set out in the Provincial Council List.

S. N. Silva J. (as he then was) in Court of Appel Application No. 736/93, on 12.10.1993,

held that;

Agrarian service is a devolved subject, within the jurisdiction of the provincial High Court.

In such circumstances, this court has consistently held that a petitioner should first invoke the

jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court, unless there are exceptional circumstances that

require the jurisdiction of this court to be invoked in the first instance.

1 1978 (second Republican Constitution) Constitution of the Republic

Page 4 of 11

The court, however, did not spell out what those exceptional circumstances are. Case law

is replete with such instances.2 A particular instance is non-accessibility to the local courts,

either due to their non existence in the relevant locality or due to extreme inconvenience

in gaining access to them. Such as when it is deemed to be physically unsafe to seek access.

(Vide-13th Amendment: Essays on Practice, Lakshman Marasinghe, Jayampathy

Wickramaratne (eds.), Stamford Lake [2010] p. 20)

The learned State Counsel relies on the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Adasuriya

Mudiyanselage Rohana Bandara vs. The Governor, Wayamba Provincial Council,

Kurunegala CA/Writ/762/08, decided on 19.05.2015 to emphasize the fact that the

exclusive justification in respect of the subject matter of the instant application is vested in

the Provincial High Court of Badulla.

However, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner heavily relies on the

judgement of the Supreme Court in Weragama vs. Eksath Lanka Wathu Kamkaru

Samithiya and others (1994) 1 Sri. L.R. 293. In view of the precedent laid down in the

said Weragama case, the learned Presidents Counsel argues that the above Adasuriya

Mudiyanselage Rohana Bandara case is per incuriam and not good authority.

It is important to note that in the said case of Weragama vs. Eksath Lanka Wathu

Kamkaru Samithiya and others, Mark Fernando J. has held as follows;

Apart from an error in punctuation (semicolon to be ignored or replaced by a comma)

the meaning of Article 154P(4) is perfectly clear; and there is no ambiguity, absurdity or

injustice justifying modification of language. (at p. 298)

None of the five judgements (in reference to the Determination3 of the Supreme

Court regarding the 13th Amendment) support the Respondents contention that there

was in the Thirteenth amendment an intention to devolve judicial power. There was nothing

more than a re-arrangement of the jurisdictions of the judiciary. (at p. 299)

However, the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article 138 is not an

entrenched jurisdiction, because Article 138 provides that it is subject to the provisions of any

2 Taczanowsca vs. Taczanowski (1957) Probate 301 at page 306; Collette vs. Collette (1968) Probate 482 at page 487; Kuklyez vs. Kuklyez (1972) Victoria Reports 50; Preston vs. Preston (1963) Probate 3 In re the Thirteenth Amendment, (1987) 2 Sri LR 312

Page 5 of 11

law"; hence it was always constitutionally permissible for that jurisdiction to be reduced or

transferred by ordinary law (of course, to a body entitled to exercise judicial power). That is

the reason why I held (in Swastika Textile Industries Ltd. v. Dayaratne, that section 3 of the

High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990, conferred concurrent,

appellate and revisionary jurisdiction on the High Courts in respect of Labour Tribunals, and

that thereafter section 31D3 of the Industrial Disputes Act, as amended by Act No. 32 of

1990, made that jurisdiction exclusive, thereby taking away the jurisdiction of the Court of

Appeal in that respect). And it was the absence of such a provision that made Parliament

unable to reduce or affect the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article 140: because

its jurisdictions under Articles 140 and 141 are entrenched; but for the proviso inserted by

the First Amendment, its jurisdiction under Article 140 cannot be transferred even to the

Supreme Court" (Determination in re the Agrarian Services (Amendment). (at p. 299,300)

(Emphasis added)

K. C. Kamalasabayson, PC, former Attorney General of Sri Lanka has expressed in an

extended essay (Vide-The exercise of judicial power and the Provincial High Courts -

Post 1994 experience in Devolution of Powers; The Sri Lankan Experience, Uditha

Egalahewa, Mahen Gopallawa (eds.), Kamalasabayson Foundation, [2009], p. 108 at 113)

as follows;

The Superior Courts of Sri Lanka have taken the view that the purpose of the establishment

of the High Court of the Provinces by the Thirteenth Amendment has been to facilitate

litigants to have their cases, in appeal, revision or by way of writs, heard in their respective

Provinces instead of having to invoke the jurisdiction of the Superior Courts in Colombo. This

has been a positive development as the establishment of this Court has been to decentralize the

judicial administration in the country. It was not the intention of the framers of the

Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution to devolve the judicial power of the

People to the Provincial High Courts, as the judicial officers in the Provinces continue

to be answerable and accountable to the Judicial Service Commission and/or the National

Legislature in the Centre. (Emphasis added)

The conflict between powers given to the Court of Appeal in Article 138, 140 & 141 of the

Constitution and powers given to the Provincial High Court under Articles 154P(3)(b) &

154P(4)(b) has been discussed extensively in the above Weragama case as well as in

Page 6 of 11

several subsequent cases such as Kamalawathie and others vs. The Provincial Public

Service Commission, North-Western Province and others (2001) 1 Sri. L.R. 1,

Ramalingam vs. Parameswary (2002) 2 Sri. L.R. 3404, Sunil Chandra Kumar vs. Veloo

(2001) 3 Sri. L.R. 915, Madduma Bandara vs. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian

Services and another (2003) 2 Sri. L.R 80.

In the said Madduma Bandara vs. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services and

another, Shirani Bandaranayake J. (as she then was) observed as follows;

Furthermore, in terms of Article 154(P) (4), High Courts of the Provinces shall have the

jurisdiction to issue according to law orders in the nature of habeas corpus, in respect of

persons illegally detained within the province; and orders in the nature of writs of certiorari,

prohibition, procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto. The jurisdiction of the High Court

of the Provinces, to issue such orders however is restricted as the Article specifies that this

power could be used only against any person exercising within the Province any power under

any law or any statute, made by the Provincial Council established for that Province in respect

of any matter set out in the Provincial Council List. It is therefore abundantly clear that for

the High Court to issue a writ quashing the order made by the 1st respondent, it is necessary

that the subject matter should belong to one of the subjects listed out in the Provincial Council

List. (at p. 83)

The word agrarian relates to landed property and such property no doubt would attract

paddy lands and tenant cultivators of such land. (at p. 91)

..In the circumstances, it appears that the subject dealing with paddy lands falls within

the ambit of the Provincial Council List and therefore the High Courts of the Provinces have

the jurisdiction to issue orders in the nature of writs by virtue of the power given to them in

terms of Article 154P of the Constitution. (at p. 91)

Having considered the legal background relating to the relevant area of law, the arguments

raised by the Respondents should be examined at this stage. The crux of the argument

relied on by the 1st, 2nd & 4th Respondents is that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear and

4 Court of Appeal 5 Supreme Court

Page 7 of 11

determine the instant application. The learned State Counsel refers to the following

passage of the said Weragama case in order to substantiate the Respondents argument.

if a law or Statue is covered by a matter in the (exclusive) Provincial Council List, but not

otherwise, the exercise of powers there under is subject to the Writ jurisdiction of the High

Court

In my view, as succinctly elaborated by Mark Fernando J. in the same Weragama case

there is no ambiguity in the language in Article 154P(4) by which the Provincial High

Court has been given the power to issue writs in respect of the matters set out in the

Provincial Council List of the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution. However, what is

pertinent to the instant application is whether the writ jurisdiction vested in the Court of

Appeal under Article 140 and 141 of the Constitution has been taken away from the Court

of Appeal in respect of matters set out in the said Provincial Council List. Mark Fernando

J. in the above Weragama case, in reference to Article 154P(4), made it clear that it is

nothing more than a re-arrangement of the jurisdictions of the judiciary and further that

the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article 140 & 141 is entrenched.

In Kalu Arachchige Allen Nona vs. Sunil Weerasinghe, Commissioner of Agrarian

Development and others CA/Writ/23/2013 decided on 10.06.2016, His Lordship

Justice Vijith Malalgoda PC (P/CA) (as His Lordship then was) has followed the

consistent principles in the above Weragama case (and also in Nilwala Vidulibala

Company (Pvt) Ltd vs. Kotapala Pradeshiya Sabha and others (2005) 1 Sri. L.R. 296

and has decided as follows;

.Under these circumstances it is understood that with regard to the applications come

within Article 154P(4) of the Constitution, Provincial High Courts are conferred with

concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of Appeal.

Therefore, in line with the precedent laid down by the aforesaid judgements, I take the

view that it is settled law that the writ jurisdiction vested in Court of Appeal under Article

140 & 141 of the Constitution has not been partially taken away by the 13th Amendment

to the Constitution in respect of the matters set out in the Provincial Council List of the

Ninth Schedule of the Constitution. Moreover, the High Court of the Province has the

concurrent writ jurisdiction in respect of the matters set out in the said Provincial Council

Page 8 of 11

List. Hence, I reject the preliminary objection on the jurisdiction of this Court raised by

the learned State Counsel and hold that this Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine

the instant application.

Now I advert to examine whether the instant application should be heard and determined

by this Court and also whether the other preliminary objection should be dealt with at this

stage.

The defense taken up in P8 and P10 by the Petitioner against the impugned Certificate,

marked P7, is that (a). he is not entitled to pay the amount mentioned in P7 as the

subject property has been gifted to him by his mother (5th Respondent). (b). the assessment

in respect of the subject land cannot be accepted. By Deed of Transfer No. 308 (marked

P4) attested by Sanjeewani S. Dayananda, Notary Public on 15.09.2014, the subject land

has been transferred to the Petitioner by the said 5th Respondent.

The Petitioner by way of the letter dated 16.07.2020, marked as G, annexed to P26

clearly gives the reasons as to why the mother of the Petitioner has transferred the subject

property by way of a deed of transfer. The Petitioners argument is that although the

subject property has been transferred by way of Deed of Transfer No. 308, the said transfer

should be considered as a gift for the purpose of calculating stamp duty.

It is observed, prima facie, that the said Deed No. 308 is nothing but an unconditional

Deed of Transfer. The subject of stamp duties on transfer of properties has been listed in

the said Provincial Council list.

The 2nd Respondent referring to Clause 48(2) of the Finance Statute of Uva Province No.

8 of 1990 has categorically informed the Petitioner that the stamp duty, in respect of a

property that is being transferred subject to a consideration, should be calculated according

to the land value of the property. Further, the 2nd Respondent as opposed to the contention

of P10 has informed the Petitioner by letter, marked P11, that the Petitioner has failed

to submit a proper appeal in terms of the provisions of the said Finance Statute.

The learned State Counsel draws the attention of Court to the documents marked P10,

P13, P15 & P19 and asserts that the Petitioner has deliberately avoided a direct

assertion as to whether the transfer of ownership of the subject land was by way of a gift

Page 9 of 11

or a transfer. The contention of the learned State Counsel is that the Petitioner did not act

with uberrima fides and has suppressed or misrepresented material facts.

At this stage, it is important to note that the Petitioner in his Petition has divulged about

an action filed in the District Court of Bandarawela. The 5th Respondent, the mother of

the Petitioner has instituted the said case bearing No. SPL/481 seeking for a declaration

that the said Deed of Transfer No. 308, in fact, was intended to be a Deed of Gift. The

Judgement of the said case was due to be delivered on 22.08.2021. The Petitioner has

reserved his rights in the Petition to tender the pleadings and proceedings of the said case

during the course of the proceedings of this application. I observe that the Petitioner has

not tendered such documents or informed this Court of the final outcome of the said case

up to date.

Similarly, the Petitioner states that he has forwarded an Appeal dated 04.08.2020 to the

3rd Respondent who is the Secretary to the Board of Review of the Uva Provincial Council

in Badulla and such appeal has not been listed for hearing.

In my view the facts/outcome regarding the above case in the District Court of

Bandarawela as well as the purported Appeal to the Board of Review in Badulla are

pertinent to decide the preliminary issues of the instant application. All impugned

decisions have been made by the Department of Provincial Revenue in Badulla. The

Petitioner also resides in Welimada and the closest High Court to his residence is in

Badulla.

At this stage, I draw my attention to the Section 12 of the High Court of the Provinces

(Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990.

Section 12 (a):

Where any appeal or application is field in the Court of Appeal and an appeal or application

in respect of the same matter has been filed in a High Court established by Article 154P of the

Constitution invoking jurisdiction vested in that Court by paragraph (3) (b) or (4) of Article

154P of the Constitution, within the time allowed for the filing of such appeal of application,

and the hearing of such appeal or application by such High Court has not commenced, the

Court of Appeal may proceed to hear and determine such appeal or application or where it

Page 10 of 11

considers it expedient to do so, direct such High Court to hear and determine such appeal or

application:

Proviso to Section 12(a):

Provided, however, that where any appeal or application which is within the jurisdiction of

a High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution is filed in the Court of Appeal,

the Court of Appeal may if it considers it expedient to do so, order that such appeal or

application be transferred to such High Court and such High Court shall hear and determine

such appeal or application.

Taking in to consideration the circumstances of the whole case and also the effect of the

above provisions in Section 12 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions)

Act, I hold that this is a fit case to be transferred to the High Court of the Uva Province,

holden in Badulla. I have exercised my discretion to arrive at the said conclusion by

reasons of the circumstances of this case and also due to the following reasons which are,

in my opinion, favourable to the Petitioner as well as to the Respondents;

i. it is expedient to hear and determine this case in the Provincial High Court in

Badulla;

ii. the convenience of the Petitioner and more fully the convenience of the officials

who are operating from Badulla or suburbs should be taken in to consideration;

iii. the District Court case in which a declaration has been sought to declare the said

Deed of Transfer as a gift, is pending in the District Court of Bandarawela;

iv. the main issue of levying stamp duty within the Province is exclusively governed

under the Finance Statute of Uva Province No. 8 of 1990 and additionally under

the Stamp Duty Act;

v. primary intention of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was to devolve

powers to the Provinces and accordingly, the people who live within the respective

provincial territorial limits should have the benefit of getting their grievances

resolved speedily at a forum closer to their homes and eventually the public

authorities in the Province also can assist Court effectively without much delay;

vi. in an event that this Court decides to issue formal notice on the Respondents, this

Court may sometimes not be able to conclude this matter expeditiously due to the

heavy work load in writ applications in the Court of Appeal;

Page 11 of 11

vii. the resistance of the 1st, 2nd & 4th Respondents who are represented by the Attorney

General for the maintainability of the instant application in this Court.

viii. the necessity to ascertain effectively the material in relation to the purported Appeal

to the Board of Review in Badulla.

In Ramalingam vs. Parameswary (2002) 2 Sri. L.R. 340 (Court of Appeal),

Wigneshwaran J. has observed as follows;

.Therefore we are of opinion that even though the Thirteenth Amendment devolved

judicial power earlier vested in the Court of Appeal to Provincial High Courts and proviso to

Sec. 12(a) of Act No. 19 of 1990 empowered this Court to transfer certain types of cases to the

appropriate High Court if considered expedient to do so, yet the use of discretion by this Court

to transfer such cases must consider inter alia the convenience of parties. We are of opinion

that when an order to transfer is made by this Court under the provisions of Act No. 19 of

1990 it must not be founded on the convenience of the of the Court of Appeal but on adequate

grounds favourable to the litigants

In the circumstances, the Application is transferred to the High Court of the Uva Province,

holden in Badulla, enabling the Honorable High Court judge to examine the other

preliminary objections raised by the learned State Counsel and also to decide on the

issuance of notice and the interim relief as prayed for by the Petitioner. In light of the

foregoing, the interim order issued by this Court on 26.08.2021 will not be further

extended.
