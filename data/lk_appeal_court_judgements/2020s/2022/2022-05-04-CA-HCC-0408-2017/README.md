JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The Accused-Appellant hereinafter referred to as the Appellant and four

others were indicted for being members of an unlawful assembly with the

common object of causing hurt to Balasuriya Archchilage Sisira Senerath

on the 30th of March 1995 and during the course of the same transaction

(i.e.: while being members of the said unlawful assembly) causing the death

of Karawita Mudiyanselage Priyantha Nirodha Karawita, an offence

punishable in terms of Section 296 read with Section 146 of the Penal

Code. They were also indicted for causing hurt to Balasuriya Arachchilage

Sisira Senerath, an offence punishable in terms of Section 315 read with

Section 146 of the Penal Code. Corresponding charges in respect of death

of Karawita Mudiyanselage Priyantha Nirodha Karawita and causing hurt

to Balasuriya Arachchilage Sisira Senerath, on the basis that they were

committed in furtherance of a common intention were also included in the

indictment.

After a non-jury trial, the Learned High Court Judge has found the

Appellant guilty in terms of both sections 296 and 315 respectively and

sentenced him to death under section 296 on 22/11/2017. For the charge

under section 315 of the Penal Code he was sentenced to 01-month

rigorous imprisonment.

During the pendency of the trial the 2nd and the 4th Appellant had passed

away. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court judge had

acquitted all the accused except the 1st accused.

3 | P a g e

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that

the Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to

the Covid 19 pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellant was

connected via Zoom from prison.

At the very outset, Learned Presidents Counsel appearing on behalf of the

Appellant had submitted to this court that he will be making submissions

only with regards to the sentence as the conviction under Section 296 of

the Penal Code cannot stand, whereas it should have been considered

under Section 297 of Penal Code on the basis of a sudden fight.

Background of the Case

In this case PW1, the injured person giving evidence said that he worked in

a brick kiln and shop which was situated in close proximity to his house.

The deceased had also stayed in the land adjoining to PW1s house and the

above-mentioned brick kiln in which he worked. Another person called

Siriwardena also worked there. In the night of 30/03/1995, around 11.00

p.m. while he was sleeping, he had heard several people shouting in front

of his house and had recognised the voice of the Appellant. When he made

his way towards the commotion, to check the reason for all the great noise,

he had seen the Appellant and all the accused mentioned in the indictment

present and standing close to the house of a person named Rathnasuriya.

He had observed that the Appellant was carrying a torch and a pointed

knife. When he tried to appease the people gathered, the Appellant had

raised his voice against him and attacked him with the knife he was

carrying. As a result, he had sustained injuries on his abdomen. At that

time the deceased had arrived and when he had tried to take him away

from the scene, there had ensued a scuffle between the Appellant and all

the other accused. As a result, the deceased had sustained a fatal stab

injury which is said to have been inflicted by the Appellant. The deceased

had made a dying declaration implicating the Appellant while he was

receiving treatment in the hospital and had thereafter passed away.

According to the post mortem report it was revealed that the deceased had

consumed alcohol at that time. Further, the Appellant also sustained

injuries over his chin which had been sutured in the hospital.

According to the doctor who held the post mortem stated that the death of

the deceased had been occasioned by toxaemia.

In Mendis v. The Queen 54 NLR 177 the court held that:

Where toxaemia supervened upon a compound fracture which

resulted from a club blow inflicted by the accused and the injured

person died of such toxaemia-

() as the injured mans death was not immediately referable to the

injury actually inflicted but was traced to some condition which arose

as a supervening link in the chain of causation, it was essential in

such cases that the prosecution should, in presenting a charge of

murder, be in a position to place evidence before the Court to establish

that in the ordinary course of nature there was a very great

probability ( as opposed to a mere likelihood) (a) of the supervening

condition arising as a consequence of the injury inflicted, and also (b)

of such supervening condition resulting in death.

The Learned Presidents Counsel, therefore, submits that the medical

evidence is totally inconclusive and contradictory, and that the conviction

for murder has not been clarified by the prosecution in this case.

It was also revealed in cross examination that during a previous incident a

person named Janaka had been accused of sexually harassing the

Appellants wife (3rd accused) of the Appellant. Due to this an enmity had

existed between these people.

5 | P a g e

As there was a fight and the Appellant had also sustained injuries, the

Learned Presidents Counsel at the very out set informed this court that he

will only be contesting the sentence in this case on the basis of a sudden

fight. He made this application under Exception 4 to Section 294 (Murder)

of the Penal Code.

The above-mentioned 4th Exception provides as follows:

Culpable homicide is not murder it is committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden

quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or

acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

Explanation: - It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the

provocation or commits the first assault.

The Learned Deputy Solicitor General, in keeping with the highest tradition

of the Attorney Generals Department, conceded that there is evidence of a

sudden fight but made submission in support of the judgment of Learned

High Court Judge.

In the event where the defence of sudden fight has not been taken up on

behalf of the Appellant, and also the injury alleged to have been inflicted on

the Appellant, the Learned High Court Judge should have considered the

evidence which favours the Appellant more meticulously.

In The King v Bellana Vitanage Eddin 41 NLR 345 the court held that:

"In a charge of murder, it is the duty of the judge to put to the

jury the alternative of finding the accused guilty of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder when there is any basis for

such a finding in the evidence on record, although such defence

was not raised nor relied upon by the accused.

6 | P a g e

In Luvis v. The Queen 56 NLR 442 the court held that:

Having regard to the evidence, the fact that sudden fight was not

specifically raised as a defence did not relieve the trial judge of the

duty of placing before the jury that aspect of the case.

Considering all the circumstances stressed before this court I conclude that

this is an appropriate case to consider for the Appellants benefit, his

entitlement for a plea of sudden fight under Exception-4 to Section 294 of

the Penal Code.

Hence, I set aside the death sentence and convict the Appellant for culpable

homicide not amounting to murder under Section 297 of the Penal Code. I

sentence the Appellant for 10 years rigorous imprisonment commencing

from the date of conviction namely 22/11/2017.

Subject to the above variation the appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to High Court of

Gampaha along with the original case record.
