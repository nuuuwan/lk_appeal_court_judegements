Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the first and the second accused appellants (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the appellants) on being aggrieved by the conviction

and the sentence of them by the learned High Court Judge of Nuwaraeliya.

Both the appellants were indicted before the High Court of Nuwaraeliya for

causing the death of one Wickramasinghe Mudiyanselage Somasiri on 26th

Page 3 of 9

January 1995, an offence punishable in terms of section 296 read with section

32 of the Penal Code.

The 1st accused was also indicted for causing injuries to one Wickramasinghe

Mudiyanselage Anil Kumara at the same transaction, an offence punishable in

terms of section 315 of the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, the learned High Court Judge of Nuwaraeliya found

both the appellants guilty as charged by his judgement dated 30th June 2016.

Accordingly, both the appellants were sentenced to death on the 1st count and

the 1st appellant was also sentenced for a rigorous imprisonment period of six

months on count two.

At the hearing of this appeal, the only ground of appeal urged by the learned

Counsel for the appellants was that the learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider in the correct perspective that there was evidence placed before the

Court to establish culpable homicide not amounting to murder in terms of

section 297 of the Penal Code.

The evidence adduced in this matter establishes that the deceased was the father

of the second accused appellant. During the time relevant to this incident, she

was running a security service in the Ragala area and the first accused appellant

had been an employee under her. The second accused appellant was separated

from her husband at that time. When this incident happened, the first accused

appellant had been at the house of the second accused appellant. The evidence

establishes that the deceased, who had his suspicions about an illicit

relationship between the appellants had come to the house, which had led to an

altercation. This has resulted in injuries to the deceased, which led to his

ultimate death.

PW-01 who has given evidence in this case was the son of the second accused

appellant who was about 8 years old at that time.

Because he has been treated as an adverse witness in terms of section 154 of

the Evidence Ordinance, during the re-examination of him by the prosecution,

the learned High Court Judge has decided to disregard his evidence in his

judgement.

Apart from his evidence, there are no eyewitnesses to the incident. The evidence

of PW-02 Anil Kumara who was the injured in this incident had been that he saw

the first accused appellant jumping out of a window of the house with a knife in

his hand and running away. He has received minor injuries when he had

attempted to stop the first accused appellant.

The main piece of evidence relied on by the learned High Court Judge to convict

both the appellants for the charge of murder had been the purported dying

declaration by the deceased Somasiri to PW-08 Police Sergeant 2861 R.M.

Kumaradasa, while being at the hospital. The said dying declaration had been

marked as P-01 at the trial. It is clear from the deposition of the deceased that

this incident has sparked off as a result of the deceased coming to the house of

the second accused appellant and the verbal altercation he had commenced with

the appellants. In the dying deposition, the deceased has stated that the 1st

accused appellant attacked him with a knife and the 2nd accused appellant

pushed him onto a bed, and after the 1st accused appellant ran away from the

place of the incident, the 2nd accused appellant also stabbed him twice.

The learned Presidents Counsel representing the 2nd accused appellant and the

learned Counsel representing the 1st accused appellant pointed out several

infirmities in the dying declaration that do not match up with the evidence of

other witnesses. However, it was their firm contention that the incident was a

result of the unexpected sudden fight, which has arisen because of the

deceaseds arrival at the house and staring and altercation with the appellants.

It was their view that although the learned High Court Judge has considered this

aspect in the judgement, his conclusions in that regard were not in the correct

perspective.

The learned Additional Solicitor General (ASG) representing the respondent, the

Honourable Attorney General, agreed that this is a matter where the evidence

should have been considered in terms of section 297 of the Penal Code, which

amounts to an offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder in terms

of exception 4 of section 294 of the Penal Code.

Consideration of the Ground of Appeal

As the conviction has been solely based on the dying declaration of the deceased

and other circumstantial evidence, I would like to draw my attention to the

relevant legal provisions in that regard.

Section 32 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance, which refers to the relevancy of a

statement by a person who is dead, and as to the transaction which resulted in

his death reads as follows;

32 (1). When the statement is made, by a person as to the cause of

his death, or to any of the circumstances of the transaction which

resulted in his death, in cases in which cause of death of that persons

death comes into question.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his book the Law of Evidence Volume 1 at page

469 citing several decided cases discuss the probative value of such evidence,

the infirmities that need to be considered, the necessary directions in the

following manner;

The probative value of dying declarations relevant under section 32 (1)

would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But there is no

doubt that such evidence suffers from certain intrinsic infirmities. Two of

Page 6 of 9

these defects are the fact that the statement was not made under oath and

the absence of cross-examination of the deponent of the statement.

The following matters requires consideration in regard to the proper

directions.

1. The deceased not been before the Court as a witness, and not having

made the statement under oath this is an infirmity in the evidence of the

statement.

2. The statement has not been tested by cross-examination.

3. The weight of that should be attributed to the statement admitted in the

circumstances of a given case.

4. If in a dying declaration, there is material favourable to the accused, the

judge should refer to it.

5. Corroboration is not always necessary to support a dying declaration.

In the case of The King V Asirwadan Nadar 51 NLR 322,

Where in a trial for murder, the dying deposition of the deceased was led

in evidence against the accused under section 32 (1) of the Evidence

Ordinance.

Held: that the attention of the jury should have been specifically

drawn to the question how far the other facts and the surrounding

circumstances proved in evidence might be said to support the truth

or otherwise of the deposition.

There cannot be any dispute in this matter that the incident has occurred due

to the fact of the deceased coming into the house of the 2nd accused appellant

and engaging in a verbal altercation with the appellants because of his

suspicions that both of them were having an affair. The evidence of PW-02

establishes the fact that after the incident, the 1st accused appellant had run

away with a knife in hand. In the dying deposition, the deceased has also

Page 7 of 9

implicated the second accused appellant for having stabbed him after the first

accused appellant left the scene, his statement in that regard has not been

supported by any other circumstantial evidence.

This goes on to establish that there was a definite sudden fight, which has

resulted in this incident and also there was no premeditation by the appellants

in causing injuries to the deceased. The relevant exception 4 of section 294 of

the Penal Code reads thus:

Exception 4 culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed

without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon

a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue

advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

Explanation it is immaterial in such cases which party offers

the provocation or commits the first assault.

It is apparent from the judgment that the learned High Court Judge was well

aware of the requirement of considering whether there was evidence placed

before the Court, which amounts to culpable homicide not amounting to murder,

even no such position has been taken up by the accused in the case.

In the case of The King Vs. Bellana Vithanage Eddin 41 NLR 345, the Court

of Criminal Appeal held;

In a charge of murder, it is the duty of the judge to put to the jury, the

alternative of finding the accused guilty of culpable homicide not amounting

to murder when there is any basis for such a finding in the evidence of

record, although such defence was not raised nor relied upon by the

accused.

Page 8 of 9

Although this aspect has been considered by the learned High Court Judge, I am

not in a position to agree with his finding that there was no basis for him to

convict the appellants on the basis of section 297 of the Penal Code.

As pointed out correctly by the learned Counsel, I find that if considered in the

correct perspective, there was sufficient evidence before the learned High Court

Judge to consider this matter in terms of exception 4 of section 294 of the Penal

Code.

As I have determined earlier, there was clear evidence that this incident was a

result of a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel. It is also

clear that there was no premeditation of any kind on the part of the appellants.

The weapon used had been a knife which may have been available at the house

when this incident happened, which shows that the assailant had not taken

undue advantage.

For the reasons adduced as above, I am of the view that this is not a case where

the appellants should have been convicted for the offence of murder.

Accordingly, I set aside the conviction of the appellants on count one and convict

them for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under section

297 of the Penal Code on the basis of a sudden fight in terms of exception 4 of

the section 294 of the Penal code.

Having considered the facts and the circumstances of this case, I sentence the

1st and the 2nd accused appellants for a term of 10 years rigorous imprisonment.

In addition, the first and the second accused appellants are ordered to pay a fine

of Rs. 20000/- each. In default, I direct that they should serve 6 months each of

simple imprisonment.

The sentence imposed on the 1st accused appellant in relation to the second

count preferred against him shall remain the same.

Considering the fact that the accused appellants have been in incarceration since

the date of conviction on 30-06-2016, I direct that the sentence of 10-year

rigorous imprisonment imposed on each of the two accused appellants shall

deem to have commenced from 30-06-2016.

The appeal is partly allowed to the above extent.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgement along with

the original case record to the relevant High Court forthwith.
