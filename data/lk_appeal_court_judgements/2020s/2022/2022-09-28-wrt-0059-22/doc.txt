Supported and Decided on : 28.09.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

Heard learned Counsel for the Petitioners in support of this application and the learned

State Counsel for the Respondents opposing this application.

Primarily, the Petitioners in this application are seeking to quash the decisions reflected in

documents marked P13(a) and P13(b). The Court observes that the said impugned

documents P13(a) and P13(b) are identical to the impugned documents (marked as

P15(a) & P15(b)) in the Case No. CA/Writ/0082/22. This Court after hearing both

parties of the said case No. CA/Writ/0082/22 refused to issue formal notice on the

relevant Respondents, based on the grounds mentioned in the order thereto, dated

28/09/2022.

The learned Counsel who appears for the Petitioner in the said case CA/Writ/0082/22 is

appearing for the 37th Respondent in the instant application No. CA/Writ/0059/22. The

learned Counsel for the Petitioners in this application categorically informs Court that she

associates with the submissions made on behalf of the said 37th Respondent. It appears as

per the rubber stamps placed on the documents, the learned registered Attorneys for the (i)

Petitioners of this case, (ii) the 37th Respondent of this case and (iii) the Petitioner of the

said case No. CA/Writ/0082/22 are from a same Law Office.

Further, this Court observes that the two documents namely P13(a) & P13(b) are being

canvassed through two different cases by two different learned Counsel in association with

the registered Attorneys of a same Law Office.

As mentioned above, the Counsel for the Petitioners of this case sails with the submissions

of the 37th Respondents Counsel who appeared for the Petitioner in case No.

CA/Writ/0082/22. The learned State Counsel in case No. CA/Writ/0082/22 submitted

that the Petitioner of that case had filed another application before this Court bearing case

No. CA/Writ/578/2021 in which this Court had refused to issue formal notices. The

learned Counsel for the above named 37th Respondent is the Counsel for those Petitioners

in CA/Writ/578/2021. The learned State Counsel in that case has pointed out (vide-

paragraph 35 of the Petition) that the Petitioner of the said CA/Writ/0082/22 had filed

the case bearing No. SC/FR/429/2021 in the Supreme Court on the identical issues. The

Court observes that such conduct of the parties and their recognized agents tend to grossly

abuse the judicial process. Hence, we are of the view that the Petitioners have come to

Court with unclean hands.

Additionally, the learned Counsel for the Petitioners submits that apart from the document

marked P13(a) and P13(b), the Petitioners are challenging the composition of the

relevant selection committee. It is observed that the same argument was raised by the

learned Counsel for the 37th Respondent when he was appearing for the Petitioner in the

said case No. CA/Writ/0082/22. Anyhow, the Petitioners have failed to manifest that

there is a duly formulated prayer to that effect in the prayer of the Petition of the Petitioners.

At the threshold stage of a judicial review application as established by several judgements,

the Court must be satisfied that there is a serious case to be heard and based on the facts

before the Court there is a probability that the Petitioner is entitled to relief. This Court

has constantly observed that the vitiating ground must be arguably material to the

impugned decision and such decision must be arguably amenable to judicial review. (See-

Jinadasa vs. Weerasinghe 31 NLR 33 and R vs. Chief Rabbi ex. p. Wachmann (1993) 2 All ER

249). Thus, we are of the unanimous view that prima facie there is no merit in the

application of the Petitioners.

In the circumstances and based on the reasons given in our order in CA/Writ/0082/22

dated 28.09.2022, we take the view that Petitioners have not submitted a prima facie case

which warrants this Court to issue formal notices on the Respondents.

Therefore, we proceed to dismiss this application.
