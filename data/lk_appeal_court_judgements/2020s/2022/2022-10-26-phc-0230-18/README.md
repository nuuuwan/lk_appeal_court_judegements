Judgment

This appeal emanates from the order made by the learned High Court Judge of the

Provincial High Court of Ratnapura on 14.11.2018 in case bearing No. RA/40/2015

against the order of the learned additional Magistrate of Ratnapura.

Page 3 of 9

It appears that Officer in Charge of the Police Station, Ratnapura had filed an

information on 08.01.2007 in terms of Section 66(1) of Primary Courts Procedure

Act No.44 of 1979, since a breach of peace between parties is threatened or likely

to be threatened. According to the information filed by the Complainant there is a

dispute in respect of the roadway leading from Elapatha to Pitilanda.

..

, ,

.

,

.........................

It was alleged by the Respondent that on or around 01.02.2007, the Appellant

forcefully blocked the roadway used by the Respondent to reach her house and

Respondent had made a complaint on 02.02.2007 to the police station of Ratnapura

stating that a footpath used by the Respondent to have access to her house has been

obstructed by a wire fence by the Appellant. Consequently, the Appellant had given

a statement to the police station of Ratnapura regarding the same dispute and

thereafter Appellant had made a complaint to the Police Station of Ratnapura stating

that the Respondent had obstructed the wire fence built by the Appellant.

However, the learned additional Magistrate acting as Primary Court Judge, having

inquired into the matter had made an Order on 02.07.2007 stating that there is no

necessity to grant a roadway in favour of Respondent since the Respondent had an

alternative roadway.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Respondent invoked the revisionary

jurisdiction of the High Court of the Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Ratnapura.

Thereafter, the learned High Court Judge by his Order dated 23.11.2013 had decided

to set aside the Order of additional Magistrate and had directed both parties to file

affidavits with documents and written submissions before the additional Magistrates

Page 4 of 9

Court of Ratnapura. On 11.08.2015, the additional Magistrate of Ratnapura, acting

as Primary Court Judge had delivered the order in favour of Respondent and had

held Respondent is entitled to use 3 feet roadway until the dispute is resolved by a

civil court with competent jurisdiction as it appears that she has a servitudanal right

over the land of Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by learned Magistrate of Ratnapura, the

Appellant invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of

Sabaragamuwa holden in Ratnapura in case bearing No. 58234 seeking to revise or

set aside the said order of the learned Magistrate made on 11.08.2015.

Consequently, the Respondent had filed statement of objections to the application

and counter objections filed by the Appellant. Thereafter, parties agreed to dispose

the inquiry by way of written submissions. Subsequently, learned High Court Judge

delivered his order dated 14.11.2018 affirming the order of the learned additional

Magistrate and dismissing the revision application of the Appellant.

It appears that the Appellant has preferred this appeal against the said order of the

learned High Court Judge on the following grounds:

Respondent is not entitled to a right of way.

Magistrate failed to exercise the jurisdiction vested upon as per Primary

Courts Procedure Act to preserve peace.

Learned High Court Judge failed to appreciate the exceptional circumstances

in Appellants case.

At the hearing, the learned counsel for the Appellant had submitted that the learned

Magistrate and learned High Court Judge have erred in failing to consider the report

of the Magistrate dated 04.05.2007 made in pursuant to a site visit.

The attention of court was drawn to the written submissions filed by the Appellant

where the position that the learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate that

exceptional circumstances exist to the Appellant when reaffirming the order of

Magistrates Court was taken up. The Appellant had contended that theres an

alternative right of way available to Respondent which amounts to be an exceptional

circumstances before the learned High Court Judge.

Page 5 of 9

The 1st Order pronounced by the learned Magistrate on 02.07.2007 and the site

inspection notes has referred to a purported alternative right of way which was

alleged by the Appellant as,

1

According to the said site inspection notes, the Respondent has access to the rear

side of the house along the . Since Ratnapura is an area where the

flooding is frequent, the said road access along the cannot be

accepted as a roadway giving access to the Respondents house.

It was submitted that Respondent had advanced credible evidence from owners and

tenant cultivators from the surrounding paddy fields and Grama-niladari to

substantiate the Respondents position that there was no other alternative roadway

to have access to her house. The said position has been clearly indicated in the

sketch of the police inspection done by the police on 12.02.2012.

Since the dispute in the instant case is relating to a right of way, it clearly manifests

that it has to be determined in terms of Section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act.

Section 69 (1) states that;

Where the dispute relates to any right to any land or any part of a land,

other than the right to possession of such land or part thereof, the Judge of

the Primary Court shall determine as to who is entitled to the right which is

the subject matter of the dispute and make an Order under Subsection (2).

Section 69 (2) states;

An Order under this Subsection may declare that any person specified

therein shall be entitled to any such right in or respecting the land or in any

part of the land as may be specified in the Order until such person is deprived

of such right by virtue of an Order or decree of a competent court, and

prohibit all disturbance or interference with the exercise of such right by such

party other than under the authority of an Order or decree as aforesaid.

Page 6 of 9

In the case of Ramalingam Vs. Thangarajah [1982] 2 SLR 693 Sharvannda J.

emphasized that;

..if the dispute is in regard to any right to any land other than right of

possession of such land, the question for decision, according to Section 69(1),

is who is entitled to the right which is subject of dispute. The word "entitle"

here connotes the ownership of the right. The Court has to determine which

of the parties has acquired that right, or is entitled for the time being to

exercise that right. In contradistinction to Section 68, Section 69 requires the

Court to determine the question which party is entitled to the disputed right

preliminary to making an order under Section 69(2).

Similarly, in the case of W.D. Leelawathie Vs. Wijeratne Manike and others CA

(PHC) 07/2006 C.A.M. 14.01.2016, Justice Walgama cited while upholding the

Judgment of the learned High Court Judge held that;

As the disputed matter relates to a road way, the Counsel for the Respondent

had taken this Court through the legal propositions enumerated by the judicial

pronouncement as stated below.

It was observed in the case of Dammadhinna Sarath Paranagama Vs.

Kamitha Aswin Paranagama CA (PHC) APN 17/2013 C.A.M 07.08.2014,

that there are two ways where the existence of such a road way can be proven

in the Primary Court, They are:

1. By adducing proof of the entitlement as is done in a Civil Court,

2. By offering proof that he is entitled to the right for the time being.

It was further held that If you described a party as being entitled to enjoy a

right but for time being, it means that it will be like that for a period of time,

but may change in the future (emphasis added).

It is to be observed that the ratio decidendi of the said case is that a party does not

need to establish a servitudanal right by cogent evidence as is usually considered in

a civil court. The required proof of the users right in terms of Section 69 (1) of the

Act, is to consider a right in the nature of a servitude or long term use. Thus, it is

sufficient to prove the enjoyment of the right at the time the dispute arose.

Page 7 of 9

In the circumstances, it is clear that the said Section 69 of Primary Courts Procedure

Act requires the Magistrates Court to determine who is entitled to the right in issue

and/or who is entitled to the right for the time being.

In the case Maddumage Sulochana Priyangika Perera Vs. Maddumage Nimal

Gunasiri Perera and others S.C. Appeal No.59/2012, S.C.M 18.01.2018 Justice

Prasanna Jayawardena held that,

..With regard to a claim of a right of way of necessity, the claimant is not

required to prove possession or user of the right of way. Instead, a claimant

who seeks a declaration from Court that he is entitled to a right of way of

necessity over the land of another, must satisfy Court that: the situation of

the claimants land is such that, the only route which can be used from the

Claimants land [without having to undergo unreasonable inconvenience or

difficulty] to access a public road or other roadway from which a public road

can be accessed, is by traversing over the land of another person and that,

therefore, by reason of necessity, he is entitled to a declaration from Court

that he is entitled to a right of way of necessity over that persons land to

access the public road or roadway.. [emphasis added]

The said Judgment of the Supreme Court only speaks of proving a right of way in a

civil matter and not in a Section 66 application under the Primary Courts Procedure

Act.

It is noteworthy that the police observation notes dated 12.02.2012 made by police

constable Gunawardane stated as follows;

.

[Emphasis added]

Page 8 of 9

In view of the said observation notes, it is evident that the footpath qualifies to be

a way of necessity for the Respondent to have access to her home. Thus, the

obstruction done by the Appellant to the said footpath has denied the Respondent

of her right of way.

It appears that in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of the counter affidavit filed by the

Respondent on 28.11.2014, the Respondent has affirmed that she has been using

this footpath since 1993, enabling her to claim servitudanal right to use the

footpath. Moreover, this position had been reaffirmed by the Grama Niladhari of

Karangoda division in his letter dated 01.02,2007 to the Complainant.

.

Thus, it appears that the Respondent had no other alternative to access her

residence apart from the footpath obstructed by the Appellant.

The learned Magistrate delivered his Order on 11.08.2015 in favour of the

Respondent, determining that the Respondent had a servitudanal right over the land

of the Appellant.

By the said Order, the learned Magistrate further held that the Order was a

temporary order and that both parties are entitled to initiate proceedings through

a competent jurisdiction of a civil court.

It is worthy to note that the learned High Court Judge has affirmed the Order of the

learned Magistrate having analysed and evaluated the evidence placed before the

Magistrate. Therefore, the Order of the learned High Court Judge is well founded.

It is seen that according to the findings of the learned High Court Judge, the

Appellant had not shown exceptional circumstances that shock the conscience of

Court which thereby would warrant the intervention of the Provincial High Court by

way of revisionary jurisdiction.

Page 9 of 9

In view of the foregoing reasons, it is apparent that the learned High Court Judge is

correct in affirming the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 11.08.2015 and in

dismissing the application for revision made by the Appellant.

Hence, we see no reason for us to interfere with the Order of the learned Magistrate

dated 11.08.2015 and the order of the learned High Court Judge dated 14.11.2018.

Thus, we dismiss this appeal with costs fixed at Rs. 35,000/-.
