Sobhitha Rajakaruna J. Heard learned Counsel for the Petitioner in support of this application and the learned State

Counsel who appears for the Respondents opposing this application.

The Petitioner in this application is seeking inter alia a mandate in the nature of a writ of

certiorari quashing the purported deportation order issued on her by the Controller General

of Department of Immigration and Emigration, Colombo, marked as X4. The said X4 is a

letter written by the said Controller General to the Petitioner to inform the Petitioner that her

visa under MED/00298 had been cancelled. The Petitioner has been advised as per the said

letter X4 to leave the country on or before 15th August 2022.

It is pertinent to observe at the outset whether any reasons have been submitted by the

Petitioner establishing her rights to continue to stay in Sri Lanka despite the cancellation of

her visa by letter marked X4. On perusal of the Petition as well as the Affidavit of the

Petitioner and also having heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, this Court observes

that no reasons have been mentioned or averred by the Petitioner to establish her rights to

continue to stay in the country.

The Petitioner has filed a motion on 16.08.2022, annexing a document marked X8 which

refers to an alleged offence of rape. However, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner

categorically indicates that the Petitioner had given instructions to Sri Lanka Police not to

proceed with the complaint made by her to police on an alleged offence of rape. The learned

Counsels contention is that the Petitioner was compelled to do so due to various other

reasons.

The Petitioner has not alleged any grounds such as legitimate expectation, necessity to take

medical treatment or legal requirement of giving evidence or appearing in a pending case in

a Court of law.

The learned State Counsel making submissions drew the attention of this Court to the

Regulations made under the Immigrants and Emigrants Act No. 20 of 1948 (as amended)

published in Government Gazette Notification No. 10,896 on 24.02.1956. In terms of the

Page 3 of 4

Regulation No. 20(1), it shall be a condition of every visa that the prescribed authority may, in his

absolute discretion, cancel, vary or amend such visa or any term of condition specified therein. By virtue

of Regulation No. 22, it shall be a condition of every resident visa that the prescribed authority may

provide that the holder thereof shall not engage in any employment, whether paid or unpaid or in any

trade or business during his stay in the country.

The learned State Counsel divulges that the Controller General of Department of

Immigration and Emigration has taken the decision in document marked X4, based on

violation of such conditions of visa by the Petitioner.

The learned State Counsel submits that the impugned document X4 is not a deportation

order as claimed by the Petitioner and she confirmed that no deportation order has been made

up to date by the authorities against the Petitioner. Further, the learned State Counsel asserts

that the Petitioner has suppressed various facts such as the type of visa that the Petitioner has

been granted and the grounds considered for extending visa etc. The learned State Counsel

argues that the Petitioner has no standing in this application as the current visa granted to the

Petitioner has not been submitted to Court for the purpose of fuller and proper adjudication

of this application.

At this stage the Court needs to draw attention to the decided Judgment in Laub vs. Attorney

General and another in (1995) 2 Sri. L.R. 88 wherein Ismail J. has held that the Controller has

the sole discretion in the matter of issuing visas and of considering applications for extensions

and an alien has no right to an audience before the Controller or Authorised Officer before he

decides not to extend his visa. Ismail J. in the said judgement has referred to the following

passage of Lord Denning M. R. in Schmidt vs. Secretary of State, Home Affairs 1969 2 Ch. D.

149, 171;

He has no right to enter this country except by leave; and, if he is given leave to come for a

limited period, he has no right to stay for a day longer than the permitted time. If his permit is

revoked before the time limit expires, he ought, I think to be given an opportunity of making

representations; for he would have a legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay for the

permitted time. Except in such a case, a foreign alien has no right, - and I could add, no legitimate

Page 4 of 4

expectation - of being allowed to stay. He can be refused, without reasons given and without a

hearing once his time has expired, he has to go.

The learned State Counsel submits that the said judgement of Ismail J. has been followed

even in CA/Writ/Application No. 308/2017 decided on 26.03.2021. The discretionary

power exercised by the Controller of Department of Immigration and Emigration has been

upheld in the Supreme Court case of Ramasamy vs. A. E. G. Moregoda 3 NLR 115.

Anyhow, I am of the view that in the absence of any reasons establishing the rights of the

Petitioner to continue to stay in the country, I should not use my discretion to review the

decision of the Controller of Department of Immigration and Emigration. Further, it is

observed that the Petitioner has failed to submit sufficient grounds to invoke the writ

jurisdiction of this Court.

Considering all the circumstances of this case, I take the view that the Petitioner has failed to

submit a prima facie case warranting this Court to issue formal notice on the Respondents.

Therefore, based on the arguability principles that should be adopted in respect of matters

relating to issuance of notice in an application for judicial review, I proceed to refuse this

application.
