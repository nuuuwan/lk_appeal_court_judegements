Mohammed Laffar, J.

The Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner)

is seeking Leave to Appeal from the order of the Board of Quazis dated

23.02.2019 dismissing the petition of the Petitioner filed against the order of the

Quazi of Colombo-East dated 08.03.2014 in case No. 117/T and the order of the

Quazi of Colombo-West dated 07.06.2014 in case No. 117/T.

On 10.03.2021, having heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioner in support

of this application and the learned Counsel for the Applicant-Respondent-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent), this Court granted

Leave to Apppeal on the questions of law set out below:

(1) Whether the talak divorce granted by the learned Quazi of Colombo-East

on 08.03.2014 is bad in law on the basis that the Petitioner objected to the said Quazi to hear the matter and the Petitioner had further sent a letter to the Judicial Service Commission requesting for another Quazi. (2) Whether the order of the learned Quazi of Colombo-West, who was

specially appointed by the Judicial Service Commission, declined to hear the case in dispute is bad in law. (3) Whether the order of the Board of Quazis dated 23.02.2019, affirming

the said orders of the learned Quazis of Colombo-East and Colombo-West are misconceived in law.

The facts in a nutshell

The case bearing No. 117/T was instituted by the Respondent (husband) against

the Petitioner (wife) seeking, inter alia, for pronouncement of talak divorce

before the Quazi for Colombo-East. Having received notices issued by the said

Quazi, the Petitioner was present before the Quazi. Subsequently, by letter dated

04.02.2014, the Petitioner informed the Quazi for Colombo-East that she would

not attend the Quazi Court as the said Quazi was biased (vide page 38 of the

brief). The Petitioner has leveled several allegations against the said Quazi in the

said letter. A copy of the said letter was dispatched to the Judicial Service

Commission as well. Furthermore, the Petitioner had dispatched an undated

letter to the Judicial Service Commission, requesting for a new Quazi to hear this

Page 4 of 9

case on the basis that she has no trust on the Quazi for Colombo-East (vide page

41 of the brief).

On 08.03.2014, despite the said letter dated 04.02.2014, the Quazi for

Colombo-East granted talak divorce. Having considered the complaint made by

the Petitioner, the Judicial Service Commission by letter dated 03.04.2014,

appointed the Quazi for Colombo-West to hear and determine the instant case

(vide page 30 of the brief). On 07.06.2014, the Quazi for Colombo-West

declined to hear the case on the footing that the talak divorce has already been

granted by the Quazi for Colombo-East (vide page 27 of the brief).

Being aggrieved by the said orders of the Quazis of Colombo-East and Colombo-

West, the Petitioner invoked the Revisionary jurisdiction of the Board of Quazis

to set aside the said orders. The Board of Quazis, having heard the submissions

of the learned Counsel for the parties dismissed the said application on

23.02.2019. Being aggrieved by the said order the instant appeal has been

preferred by the Petitioner.

The Order of the Quazi for Colombo-East dated 08.03.2014

Section 67 of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, No. 13 of 1951 (as

amended) provides that,

Where it appears to the Judicial Service Commission, on the application

of any party to, or any person interested in, any proceedings instituted or

to be instituted under this Act before a Quazi, that a fair and impartial

inquiry cannot be had before such Quazi, or where a Quazi himself makes

an application in that behalf to the said Commission, the Commission may

order that such proceedings be instituted before and heard by a special

Quazi appointed in that behalf by the Commission under section 14 and,

in the event of any such order being made, any proceedings taken before

the first-mentioned Quazi in respect of the matter to which such

application relates shall be of no effect.

It is true that a Quazi is entitled to proceed with any proceedings filed before him

until a decision is made by the Judicial Service Commission under section 67 of

Page 5 of 9

the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act. However, when a party to an action is

exercising his statutory right under section 67 of the said Act, requesting the

Judicial Service Commission to appoint a new Quazi on the ground of basis of

the present Quazi, there is a moral duty cast upon the present Quazi to delay the

matter till he obtains further instructions from the Judicial Service Commission.

In the instant case, the Quazi for Colombo-East was fully aware that there is a

written complaint made by the Petitioner to the Judicial Service Commission

against him. It is to be noted that very grievous allegations have been leveled

against the Quazi in the written complaint. The Quazi concerned has mentioned

in the impugned order dated 08.03.2014 as to the complaint made by the

Petitioner. Despite the above facts, the Quazi for Colombo-East decided the

matter against the Petitioner in a short period of one month from the date of the

complaint.

The conduct of the Quazi for Colombo-East, not delaying the proceedings for the

directions of the Judicial Service Commission pertaining to the complaint made

by the Petitioner, not seeking further instructions from the Judicial Service

Commission and concluding the proceedings in a short period of time buttress

the allegations leveled against him by the Petitioner. In these respects, it appears

to this Court that the Petitioner had not been given a fair trial before the Quazi

Court.

It is well settled that every member of a court of law that is called upon to try

issues in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings must be able to act judicially; and

it is of the essence of judicial decisions and judicial administration that

adjudicators should be able to act impartially, objectively and without any bias.

In such cases, the test is not whether in fact a bias has affected the judgment; the

test always is and must be whether a litigant could reasonably apprehend that a

bias attributable to a member of the tribunal might have operated against him in

the final decision of the tribunal. Thus, it is often said that justice must not only

be done but must also appear to be done [vide R v. Sussex Justices, ex parte

McCarthy (1924) 1 KB 256].

Page 6 of 9

The principle which emerges from bias is not concerned with the fact that the

decision maker was biased, but with the possibility that he or she might have

been biased i.e., a real likelihood of bias [vide Simon v. Commissioner of National

Housing (1972) 75 NLR 471]. It is necessary to point out, however, that courts

will not merely uphold a plea of bias simply because a party has raised it. It

should be made clear that a party wishing to raise a complaint of bias has to do

so with the adjudicator. The adjudicator is enjoined to consider such objection

and make a decision. Where the objection of bias has not been raised before the

adjudicator, the complainant has to demonstrate actual bias in the proceedings

on appeal or judicial review.

Question of likelihood of bias can only, logically, be raised before or perhaps

during the proceedings in question. It can never be based on conjecture or on

flimsy insubstantial grounds and there must be material which shows a tendency

to favour one side unfairly at the expense of the other [vide Dr. Karunaratne v.

Attorney General and Another (1995) 2 Sri LR 298 per Gunersekera, J at page

302]. In such cases, an affected party would normally be expected to request that

the person suspected of such bias recuse himself from participation in the

proceedings in question. Parties may be held to have waived the right to invoke

the bias rule if they were fully informed of the facts that could support a claim

of bias but failed to raise the issue in a timely manner. Vide Canada (H.R.C.) v.

Taylor [(1990) 3 SCR 892] and In re Human Rights Tribunal and Atomic Energy

of Canada Ltd. [(1986) 1 FC 103 (CA)]. Accordingly, in my view, where a party

does not raise any objections then such party cannot rely on the ground of

likelihood of bias on appeal or judicial review. This ensures that the tribunals

decisions are not set aside based on a point that had not been brought to their

attention (vide S. Victor Wijerathne v. Tissa R. Balalle and Others,

CA/Writ/262/14, Court of Appeal Minutes of 05.08.2021).

In the instant case, the Petitioner has categorically, in writing, informed the

Quazi and the Judicial Service Commission that the said Quazi is bias. In such a

situation, the Quazi would have declined to hear the case and requested for a

new Quazi from the Commission in order to get rid of the allegations leveled

against him. In contrast, the Quazi in the instant case, determined the matter in

a very short period of time against the Petitioner who made allegations against

Page 7 of 9

him, which amounts to bias. In my view, when a party to an action expressly and

logically informed Court that the adjudicator is bias, such adjudicator becomes

disqualified to adjudicate the matter on the doctrine of fair trial.

In these respects, I am of the view that the decision of the Quazi for Colombo-

East dated 08.03.2014 is palpably misconceived in law and liable to be set aside.

Furthermore, in terms of the Rule No. 2 of the Second Schedule of the Muslim

Marriage and Divorce Act, the talak shall be pronounced before two witnesses,

which reads thus,

. The husband, if desires to proceed with the divorce, shall pronounce

the talak in the presence of the Quazi and two witnesses, and the Quazi

shall forthwith record such pronouncement and shall cause notice thereof

to be served upon the wife, if she is not present

It is borne out from the impugned order of the Quazi for Colombo-East dated

08.03.2014 that, the talak has not properly been pronounced before the

witnesses though it is stated by the Quazi that the same was pronounced before

two witnesses (vide page 38 of the brief). There is a document filed of record at

page 33 of the brief stating that, the talak was pronounced before two witnesses

whereas the name and the addresses of the purported witnesses have not been

mentioned in the said document. In the circumstances, it appears to this Court

that the talak in dispute has not been pronounced in terms of the provisions of

the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act.

The Order of the Quazi for Colombo-West dated 07.06.2014

It is abundantly clear that the order made by the Quazi for Colombo-West dated

07.06.2014, refusing to hear the matter on the basis that the talak divorce was

already granted by the previous Quazi was palpably erroneous. It is pertinent to

be noted that, once the Quazi for Colombo-West is appointed by the Judicial

Service Commission, under section 67 of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act,

the entire proceedings taken before the first mentioned Quazi in respect of the

matter to which such application relates shall be of no effect. As such, there is no

legal impediment for the present Quazi to comply with the directions of the

Page 8 of 9

Commission. If the present Quazi is of the opinion that he is unable to proceed

with the matter, he should obtain prior instructions from the authority (Judicial

Service Commission) before making the impugned order. In the circumstances,

the arbitrary order made by the Quazi for Colombo-West, refusing to hear the

application of the Petitioner is erroneous and misconceived in law.

The Order of the Board of Quazis dated 23.02.2019

Having scrutinized the order of the Board of Quazis, it appears to this Court that

the Board of Quazis totally failed to consider the grievous allegations leveled

against the previous Quazi by the Petitioner. As I have already stated, on the

concept of fair trial, it is advisable for an adjudicator not to hear a case where

the parties have no faith and trust on him, even though that there are no legal

impediments for him to proceed with the matter. Similarly, the Board of Quazis

has misdirected itself that there is no provision for the Quazi of Colombo-West

to inform the Judicial Service Commission as to the dismissal of the Petitioners

application. In terms of section 67 of the said Act, when the Quazi for Colombo-

West is appointed by the Judicial Service Commission to hear and determine the

mater, if the said Quazi is not in a position to comply with the directions of the

Commission, he is duty bound to inform the Commission before making any

adverse order. Thus, the impugned order of the Board of Quazis is also bad in

law.

For the foregoing reasons, I proceed to allow the appeal with cost fixed at Rs.

50,000/-.

The order of the Quazi for Colombo-East dated 08.03.2014 in case No. 117/T,

the order of the Quazi of Colombo-West dated 07.06.2014 in case No. 117/T

and the order of the Board of Quazis dated 23.02.2019 in case No.

51/14/R/CMB are hereby set aside.

The Quazi of Colombo-West is ordered to hear and determine the matter a fresh

in terms of the directions given by the Judicial Service Commission on

03.04.2014.

The Registrar is directed to issue a copy of this judgment to the Board of Quazis,
