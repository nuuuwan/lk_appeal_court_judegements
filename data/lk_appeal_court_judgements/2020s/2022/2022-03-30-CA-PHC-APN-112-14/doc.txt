This is an application for revision and restitutio in intergrum filed on 12.09.2014

against the order of the High Court dated 31.10.2014 which enhanced the

sentence of the petitioner (on appeal) imposed by the learned Magistrate of

Maligakanda in Case No 20370/10 on 04.03.2010. Aggrieved by the said

enhancement, the petitioner has preferred the present application impugning the

order of the High Court dated 31.10.2014.

The petitioner was the accused in MC case No 20370/10 for committing offences

under the Tobacco Tax Act No 8 of 1999 (as amended) hereinafter the Act, for

dealing with 3000 packets of counterfeit John Player Gold Leaf cigarettes.

Petitioner pleaded guilty and was convicted where the learned Magistrate

imposed a fine of Rs. 25,000, the default of which would sentence the petitioner

CA-PHC-APN- 112-14 Page 4 of 7 30/03/2022 IJ- 14-22

for 3 months Rigorous Imprisonment. An appeal against the sentence was filed

in High Court by the Ceylon Tobacco Company PLC (CTC). CTC claimed that it is

the sole person, whether corporate or otherwise, granted a Certificate of

Registration for the manufacture of cigarettes under and in terms of the Act

within Sri Lanka. In the said appeal, CTC referred to the maximum punishment

envisioned by the Act, stating that the learned Magistrate has erred in merely

imposing a fine of Rs. 25,000. During oral arguments of the appeal before the

High Court, the petitioner was not represented and an order enhancing the

sentence was delivered on 31.01.2014. By the said order, the learned High Court

Judge sentenced the petitioner for 2 years Rigorous Imprisonment suspended for

ten years and imposed the maximum fine of Rs. 1 million with a default sentence

of 1-year Rigorous Imprisonment.

As such, the primary contention to be determined by this Court is whether the

impugned order dated 31.01.2014 is plagued with any irregularity amounting to

an exceptionality that warrants the invocation of the revisionary jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal.

A starting point to such determination is the Penalty Section of the Act as

amended by Amendment Act, No. 9 of 2004. Thus, Section 15 (1) of the Act

stipulates the following:

Every person guilty of an offence under this Act shall on conviction after

summary trial before a Magistrate be liable to a fine not exceeding one

million rupees or to imprisonment of either description for a term not

exceeding five years. (Emphasis Added)

The intention of the legislature in formulating Section 15(1) of the Act is clear,

that is every person guilty of an offence under the Act, upon conviction, will be

liable to a fine or will be liable for imprisonment. The statute does not envision a

situation where both a fine and a term of imprisonment is imposed. This is

evident even in the Sinhala text of the Act, where Section 15(1) reads as follows:

CA-PHC-APN- 112-14 Page 5 of 7 30/03/2022 IJ- 14-22

When tracing the legislative history of the Act, Section 15 has but one amendment

in 2004. That too deals with Sub Section (2) rather than Sub Section (1) which is

applicable to the instant matter.

At this juncture, it is pertinent to refer to the following observations by Her

Ladyship Justice Shirani Bandaranayake in Attorney General and Others v

Sumathipala (2006) 2 SLR 126 - it is to be taken as a fundamental principle

standing as it were on the threshold of the whole subject of interpretation, that the

plain intention of the legislature, as expressed by the language employed is

invariably to be accepted and carried into effect, whatever may be the opinion of

the judicial interpreter of its wisdom or justice. If the language admits of no doubt

or secondary meaning, it is to be obeyed

Similarly, in Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes (12th Edition at page28),

states The first and most elementary rule of construction is that is to be assumed

that the word and phrases of technical legislation are used in their technical

meaning if they have acquired one, and otherwise in their ordinary meaning, and

second is that the phrase and sentences are to be construed according to the rules

of grammar.

Whenever the legislative language is plain and definitive, yielding to one meaning

alone without ambiguity, courts are bound to enforce the same, however harsh

or inadequate it seems. Section 15 of the Act has entrusted the courts with broad

discretion to impose either a term of imprisonment or a fine when a person is

found guilty under the Act. After the conclusion of the summary trial, the judge

is empowered to determine the most suitable punishment based on the facts and

circumstances of each case. The only caveat in such a use of discretion is that

CA-PHC-APN- 112-14 Page 6 of 7 30/03/2022 IJ- 14-22

its exercise must not be arbitrary or made in a fanciful manner. It should be

sound and guided in law.

When interpreted in its plain meaning, Section 15 of the Act does not give rise to

any harshness or inadequacy. It gives two options to the judge: either to impose

a fine or a term of imprisonment. The impugned order has been misguided to

impose both a fine and a term of imprisonment when the legislature only intended

to impose one or the other. Such an interpretation of Section 15 of the Act is an

absurdity and contrary to common sense. Therefore, it is the considered view of

this Court that the imposition of both a fine and a term of imprisonment is a

grave misconstruction of the plain and unambiguous stipulations of law as

contained in Section 15 (1) Tobacco Tax Act No 8 of 1999 (as amended).

This Court see no reason to interfere with the sentence of the learned Magistrate

dated 04.03.2010. The imposition of a fine of Rs. 25,000 is within the ambit of

the discretion of the Magistrate and a party cannot insist on the imposition of the

maximum penalty envisioned by a statutory provision unless compelling reasons

are provided. An aggrieved party is in no way entitled by way of a right to demand

the maximum punishment. Such party can only make a request and the final

determination lies with the judge where he uses his discretion depending on the

facts of each case. The Law stipulates that upon conviction, an accused will be

liable to a fine not exceeding one million rupees or to imprisonment of either

description for a term not exceeding five years. The learned Magistrate in the

instant matter, after accepting a plea of guilt by the petitioner at the first instant,

has opted to impose a fine and has set the quantum of such fine as Rs. 25,000/.

There is no irregularity in this sentence. Nothing has been presented to this Court

to say that the petitioner was a repeat offender of similar offences or any other

offence.

In summation, the instant application deals with the discretion of the learned

Magistrate in imposing a fine upon conviction of an offence as per Section 15(1)

of the Tobacco Tax Act No 8 of 1999 (as amended), based on the facts and

circumstances of the case. This Court see no reason to interfere with the use of

discretion by the learned Magistrate.
