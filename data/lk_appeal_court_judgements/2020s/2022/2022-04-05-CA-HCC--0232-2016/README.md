JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted by the Attorney General for

committing an offence under section 364(1) of the Penal Code against

Gunasekera Archchilage Niluka Krishanthi on or about the 10th of October

2005.

The trial commenced on 11/01/2011. The Appellant had elected a non-jury

trial when the indictment was served on him. After leading all necessary

witnesses, the prosecution had closed the case on 15/11/2011. The

Learned High Court Judge had called for the defence on the same day and

the counsel for the Appellant had moved for a day to call witnesses on his

behalf. When this case was called on 09/01/2012, the defence counsel had

filed a list of witnesses on behalf of the Appellant.

When this case was called for the defence case on 09/02/2012, the

prosecuting counsel had informed the court that after considering the

evidence presented, the prosecution was going to amend the indictment by

adding an alternative charge for Grave Sexual Abuse under Section 365 (b)

(2) of the Penal Code as amended. Accordingly, the amended indictment

under Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979

3 | P a g e

was filed in court on 09/02/2012 amidst the objection of the defence

counsel.

The second alternative count in the amended indictment reads as follows:

In the alternative to the above mentioned charge and at the time, place and

in the course of the same transaction the accused had for the purpose of

obtaining sexual gratification, using a part of his body, that is by

threatening Gunasekera Archchilage Nilusha Krishanthi by showing a

knife, made Gunasekera Archchilage Nilusha Krishanthi drink a liquid and

removed her clothes so as to reveal her genitalia and by so revealing

Gunasekera Archchilage Nilusha Krishanthis genitalia, has committed an

offence punishable under Section 365 (b) (2) the Penal Code as amended by

Act No. 22 of 1995 known as sexual abuse.

Thereafter, with the leave of the court, the prosecution had recalled

witnesses 1,2,3 and 11 and closed the case.

Defence was called after refusing the application made under Section

200(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979. The Appellant

gave evidence and was subjected to cross-examination by the State

Counsel. Before the cross-examination, upon the Application of the

prosecution, both the counsels had gone to the place of the incident for an

inspection. After conclusion of the Appellants evidence, several others had

also been called to give evidence on behalf of the Appellant and the defence

had then closed their case.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the evidence presented by

both parties, convicted the Appellant for the alternative charge under

Section 365 (b) (2) of the Penal Code as amended, and sentenced the

Appellant to 20 years rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of

Rs.20,000/- subject to a default sentence of 01-year simple imprisonment.

In addition, a compensation of Rs.400000/- was ordered with a default

sentence of 02 years simple imprisonment.

4 | P a g e

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that

the Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to

the Covid 19 pandemic. During the argument he was connected via Zoom

from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. The amendment made to the indictment.

2. The Learned Trial Judge failed to make a determination that the

prosecution had proved the identity of the appellant beyond

reasonable doubt.

The Learned High Court Judge had allowed an application made by the

prosecution to amend the indictment after the conclusion of the

prosecution case. Amidst the objection, the prosecution amended the

indictment and brought an alternative count under section 365 (b) (2) of

the Penal Code as amended. The only reason for the amendment was that

the victim had not elicited any evidence pertaining to the charge of rape

levelled against the Appellant.

In a criminal trial the basic foundation is the charge. By charging, an

accused is provided information as to the nature of the allegation levelled

against him. The charge must identify the act committed by the accused,

the law alleged to have been violated by him and particulars pertaining to

the alleged offence must be specified in the charge.

It is the profound duty of a prosecutor to frame charge/s after careful

consideration of evidence available in the case at the time of drafting the

charge. The requirements of a valid charge are set out in Sections 164 and

165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

5 | P a g e

In this case the Hon. Attorney General in the first indictment indicted the

Appellant under 364(1) of the Penal Code as amended. After the conclusion

of the prosecution case and when the defence was called the State Counsel

making an application under Section 167 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, requested the court to grant permission to

amend the indictment. Despite the objection raised by the counsel for the

Appellant, the Learned High Court Judge had allowed the application. In

the second indictment the State Counsel added an alternative charge under

Section 365(b) (2) of the Penal Code as amended.

This clearly shows that the evidence led by the prosecution was

unsuccessful to maintain the charge under section 364(1) of the Penal

Code as amended.

Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 reads as

follows:

1. Any court may alter any indictment or charge at any time

before judgment is pronounced or, in the case of trials, before

the High Court by a jury, before the verdict of the jury is

returned.

2. Every such alteration shall be read and explained to the

accused.

3. The substitution of one charge for another in an indictment or

the addition of a new charge to an indictment and in a

Magistrates Court the substitution of one charge for another

or the addition of a new charge shall be deemed to be an

alteration of such indictment or charge within the meaning of

this section.

In John Perera v. Weerasinghe 53 NLR 158 the court held that:

An amendment of a charge should not be refused by the judge unless

it is likely to do substantial injustice to the accused.

6 | P a g e

In Doole v. The Republic of Sri Lanka [1978-1979] 2 SLR 33 the court

held that:

as a rule an amendment to an indictment should be allowed if

it would have the effect of convicting the guilty or securing the

acquittal of the innocent, but it should not be allowed if it would

cause substantial injustice or prejudice to the accused.

In this case, after the conclusion of the prosecution case and after calling

the defence, the prosecution had made an application to amend the

existing charge under Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No. 15 of 1979. But the prosecution had presented the amended

indictment with an alternative count under Section 365 (b) (2) of the Penal

Code as amended. The reason for the amendment was that evidence

presented during the trial was not fitted to bring a conviction under Section

364(1) of Penal Code as amended. Hence, the question arises as to whether

the charge brought under Section 365(b) (2) to the indictment as an

alternative count is proper in this case.

In this case, at the time of closing the case for the prosecution, they were

unable to prove the charge of rape against the Appellant. As the prosecutrix

had already doubted about her evidence, the prosecution is not entitled to

bring an alternative charge to the indictment under Section 365(b) (2) (b).

In a charge of rape, the prosecution must prove penetration. In grave

sexual abuse prosecution is not required to prove penetration. Thus, the

ingredients in a charge of rape are different from the ingredients that must

be proved in a charge of grave sexual abuse. Hence, the best course of

action should have been the amendment of the existing charge as

requested under Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

7 | P a g e

In CA/88/2002 decided on 19/06/2007 W.L.R.Silva J held that:

Grave sexual abuse is a cognate offence introduced by a

separate amendment and is a specific offence having its own

ingredients.

The court further held that:

We are of the view, that grave sexual abuse can never be

considered as a lesser offence under Section 178 of the Criminal

Procedure Code.

In R. T. Wilbert and 3 others v. Newman 75 NLR 138 the court held that:

It should have been apparent to the Magistrate, if he had made

the slightest study of the Charge, that to fell tress is an offence

distinct from causing trees to be felled. I presume that he is

aware that Section 178 of the Criminal Procedure Code enacts

that for every distinct offence of which any person is accused

there shall be a separate Charge and every such Charge shall

be tried separately.

Hence, in this case, amending the indictment by bringing an alternative

count, which is a distinct offence is an error caused by the prosecution.

The proper procedure that should have been followed by the prosecution is

to amend the charge of rape to one of grave sexual abuse and then to

proceed with the case.

Section 365 B (1) states:

Grave Sexual Abuse is committed by any person who, for sexual

gratification does any act by the use of his genitals or any other part

of the human body or any instrument on any orifice or part of the

body of any other person being an act which does not amount to rape

under section 363

8 | P a g e

In Mahalakotuwa v. The Attorney General [2011] 2 B.L.R 406 D.S.C

Lecamwasam,J. held that:

On a plain reading of the above section it is clear, that the section

envisaged a grave situation which falls short of rape. It cannot be a

mere Touch. It has to be much more serious than a touch and to come

within the ambit of Grave Sexual Abuse it must be of a very high

degree, so serious and grave in nature that it can only fall short of

Rape, but must surpass situations expected in section 345,365 and

365A.

In this case it is very important to consider whether the alternative charge

clearly reflected the offence under Section 365 B (1) of the Penal Code as

amended. In the body of the charge, it is alleged that in order to obtain

sexual gratification, the appellant used his body by threatening the victim

using a knife and so forced the victim to drink some liquid and thereafter

removed her clothes so as to reveal her genitalia.

As discussed above, Section 365B (1) requires the presence of grave

circumstances to punish an accused under it. In this case as per the

charge the Appellant was said to have threatened the victim with a knife,

made her to drink some liquid and removed her clothes so as to reveal her

genitalia.

According to PW1 the victim of this case, she had travelled from her home

to Bandaranayake International Airport on 09/10/2005 to go to Kuwait for

employment. When she was seated near the departure gate following the

requisite formalities, the Appellant had arrived and enquired whether

anybody there had come through Saman Agency. As she had come through

Saman Agency, the Appellant had taken her passport along with the other

documents and escorted her to another floor in a lift with two others. After

speaking to the other persons, the Appellant had opened a room and took

her inside. One of the persons had dissolved something in a glass and the

9 | P a g e

Appellant had forced her to drink the same. At that time the Appellant had

threatened her with a knife. After drinking she had lost her consciousness

and when she regained her senses, she was on a cardboard sheet and her

blouse was half removed and her skirt was fully removed revealing her

genitalia. The Appellant was in the room and he had removed his shoes

and his cap. Thereafter, she was taken to the departure gate and guided

into a bus for boarding. Although it was her evidence that she informed

what happened to her to several female airline officers who were present,

no one has taken any action. She had left for Kuwait but had fallen sick

upon arrival. Hence, she was sent back to Sri Lanka after about 10 days.

She had lodged a complaint with the Foreign Employment Bureau after her

arrival. After inquiry the Airport Police had arrested several people

including the Appellant. She had identified the Appellant at the

identification parade.

With the evidence of PW1 it is very pertinent to consider whether the

alternative charge properly reflected and supported her evidence in this

case. According to the charge the Appellant used part of his body only to

threaten the victim with a knife and forced her to drink some liquid.

Thereafter, the charge goes on to say that the Appellant had removed her

clothes revealing her genitalia.

According to the plain reading of Section 365 B (1) of the Penal Code, I

conclude that none of the acts said to have committed on the victim

constitute an offence under 365 B (1) of the Penal Code in this case. Hence

it is necessary to consider what the appropriate section is, that should have

been considered under the Penal code in this case.

Section 345 of Penal Code as amended states:

Whoever, by assault or use of criminal force, sexually harasses

another person, or by the use of words or actions, causes sexual

annoyance or harassment to such other person commits the offence

10 | P a g e

of sexual harassment and shall on conviction be punished with

imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to

five years or with fine or with both and may also be ordered to pay

compensation of an amount determined by court to the person in

respect of whom the offence was committed for the injuries caused to

such person.

EXPLANATION

1. Unwelcome sexual advances by words or action used by a person

in authority, to a working place or any other place, shall constitute

the offence of sexual harassment.

2.For the purposes of this section an assault may include any act

that does not amount to rape under section 363 or grave sexual

abuse under section 365B.

3. "injuries" includes psychological or mental trauma.

In Mahalakotuwa v. The Attorney General (Supra) the court held that:

or annoyance.. To constitute the offence of sexual harassment,

assault or criminal force is a pre-requisite. Section 341 of the Penal

Code defines criminal force in following words- whoever intentionally

uses force to any person without that persons consent..knowing it to

be likely that by the use of such force he will illegally cause injury, fear

According to the facts of this case, taking the victim under his authority,

the Appellant intentionally used force on the victim and removed her

clothes and thereby had caused sexual harassment and committed an

offence under section 345 of the Penal Code and not under section 365 B

(1) of the Penal Code as amended.

11 | P a g e

In Mahalakotuwa v. The Attorney General (Supra) the court further held

that:

Assuming but without conceding, that the act committed by the

appellant falls within both sections 345 and 365B or alternatively if it

is uncertain as to which precise section of the two it falls under, then

he should be convicted under section 345 and not 365B. According to

Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes 12th edition page 239 Lord

Esher M.R. had held in Tuck and Sons v. Priester (1887 (19) QBD

629 at 638) ..if there are two reasonable constructions we must give

the more lenient one

In this case Learned High Court Judge who delivered the judgment had not

gone through the ingredients of the Sections 365B and 345 of the Penal

Code as amended with the alternative charge filed in the amended

indictment. Had this been looked into at that time, the court could have

sentenced the Appellant under Section 345 of the Penal Code.

In Mahalakotuwa v. The Attorney General (Supra) the court further held

that:

In a case of this nature when the facts clearly show that the accused

cannot brought under 365B (2) b, learned judges should not hesitate to

use their prudence in deciding whether a particular set of facts

constitute the offence contained in the indictment or not. If not, without

mechanically passing the sentence on the indictment already filed they

must have the audacity to act under 177 or 178 of the CPC and convict

the accused accordingly for a different offence.

As the appeal ground one has merits and greatly affect the finding of the

trial court, it is not necessary for this court to consider the second ground

of appeal raised by the Appellant.

12 | P a g e

As discussed above, the evidence adduced by the prosecution does not

support the conviction entered by Learned High Court Judge of Negombo

dated 10/08/2016. Hence, I set aside said conviction and substitute a

conviction under Section 345 of the Penal Code as amended and impose

five years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10000/- with a default

sentence of 01-year rigorous imprisonment. Further, the Appellant is

ordered to pay a sum of Rs.300000/- to the PW1 as compensation and in

default serve 2 years of rigorous imprisonment. Considering all the

circumstances of this case I order the sentence to take effect from the date

of conviction i.e., from 10/08/2016.

Subject to the above variations, the appeal is dismissed.
