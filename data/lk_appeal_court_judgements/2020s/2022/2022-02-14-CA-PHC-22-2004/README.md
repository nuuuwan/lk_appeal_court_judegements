Judgment

The Officer in Charge of the police station, Ahungalle had filed an information under Section 66

(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act in the Magistrates Court of Balapitiya regarding a

dispute between 1st-5th Respondents and 6th-8th Respondents in respect of a right of way along the

reservation of Karijjapitiya canal.

Upon service of summons, all parties appeared before Court and 9th-12th Respondents have been

intervened. Thereafter, parties filed their respective affidavits, counter affidavits and written

submissions.

It appears that at the inquiry 1st-5th Respondents and 9th-12th Respondents had taken up the position

that they have 12 feet wide right of access along Karijjapitiya canal, over the land of the 7th

Defendant.

Page 4 of 7

However, the learned Magistrate acting as the Primary Court Judge held that there was no 12 feet

wide roadway as claimed by the said Respondents and granted only a footpath to the 1st-5th

Respondents and 9th-12th Respondents.

Being aggrieved by the said Order dated 30.10.2002, the 7th Respondent-Petitioner invoked the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Southern Province holden at Balapitiya.

The learned High Court Judge after hearing of the Case, granted a right of access to the 1st-5th

Respondents and 9th-12th Respondents as shown in the police observations.

On behalf of the 7th Respondent-Petitioner, it was submitted that when all the facts are in favour

of the 7th Respondent-Petitioner, it is highly unreasonable on the part of the learned High Court

Judge to make an Order to give a right of access as shown in the police observations, which are

vague and uncertain and it does not even show a footpath existed along the boundary of the 7th

Respondent-Petitioner.

Admittedly, the instant action is over a right of access over the land of the 7th Respondent-

Petitioner. Thus the matter in dispute comes under the purview of Section 69(1) of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act.

Being aggrieved by the said determination of the learned High Court Judge, 7th Respondent-

Petitioner-Appellant [hereinafter referred to as the 7th Respondent-Appellant] preferred this appeal

to this Court.

It is relevant to note that the dispute arose among the parties, where the 7th Respondent-Appellant

had obstructed a roadway used by 1st-5th Respondents and 9th-12th Respondents by cutting a trench

across the said pathway.

According to the 1st-5th Respondents and 9th-12th Respondents, the disputed roadway is situated

along the canal reservation.

Page 5 of 7

It was alleged by the 7th Respondent-Appellant that the said Respondents are trying to obtain a

road over Lot 1 and Lot 2 in final plan bearing No. 2209 [72] in which the 7th Respondent-

Appellant became the owner of the said land by a partition decree [71].

According to the schedule of the said partition decree;

01. ......... 2209 , ,

,

25 01 ,

- 03,

- 19,

- 02, 17 .

- ....

02. ......... 2209 ....

It is observable that in the 1st and 2nd schedules of the said partition decree, the Southern boundary

of part of Lot 1 and Lot 2 are bounded by . The final partition plan [72] clearly depicts that

the Southern boundary of Lot 1 and Lot 2 is .

The said plan [72] clearly shows the which leads to the Colombo-Galle main road and

continues underneath towards the main road.

The right side and the left side of the shows a [Bund], thus Lot 1 and Lot 2 abuts the

canal. But there is no canal reservation shown. It is imperative to note that if there is a bund, there

should be a canal reservation.

It is seen that the learned Magistrate relied upon the observation notes made by the investigating

police officer as follows;

The Court observes the findings of the learned High Court Judge where the learned High Court

Judge has stated in his Order that;

It is worthy to note the statement dated 29.03.2002 [5] made by the 7th Responded-Appellant to

the station-Ahungalle.

In view of the Judgment Ananda Sarath Paranagama Vs. Dhammadinna Sarath Paranagama

and Kamitha Aswin Paranagama CA (PHC) APN 117/2013,

A party does not need to establish a servitudanal right by cogent evidence as is usually considered

in a civil Court. The required proof of the users right in terms of Section 69 (1) of the Act, is to

consider a right in the nature of a servitude or long terms use.

According to the facts placed before the learned Primary Court Judge, I am of the view that the

Respondents have established a prima facie entitlement to a right [foot-path] which is in the nature

of a servitude along with the canal reservation between the Appellants land and the bund up to

the Colombo-Galle main road.

Hence, we see no reason for us to interfere with the Order dated 30.10.2002 made by the learned

Primary Court Judge and the Order dated 16.12.2003 by the learned High Court Judge. Thus the

appeal is accordingly dismissed without costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL K.K.A.V. Swarnadhipathi, J.

I agree.
