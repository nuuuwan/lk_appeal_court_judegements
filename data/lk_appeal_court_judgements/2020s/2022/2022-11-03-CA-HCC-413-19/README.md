The accused-appellant was indicted before the High Court of

Rathnapura for the following three charges.

1. On or about the 15th of March 2008, committing the rape of

Godaarawe Kankanamalage Hema Mallika, an offence

punishable under section 364(1) of the Penal Code.

3

2. During the same transaction, committing the offence of

Grave Sexual Abuse of the said victim by causing anal

penetration, an offence punishable under section 365(2)(b) of

the Penal Code.

3. During the same transaction, committing the offence of

Robbery of a gold ring worth Rs. 1400/- and a pair of gold

bangles worth Rs. 250/- from the possession of the said

victim, an offence punishable under section 380 of the Penal

Code.

After the trial, the learned High Court Judge convicted the accused-

appellant for all three counts and sentenced him. This appeal has been

preferred against the said convictions and sentences. At the hearing

of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant and the learned

Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent made oral submissions.

Both parties have tendered their written submissions, prior to the

hearing.

The facts of the prosecution case could be summarized as follows:

At the time of the incident, the prosecutrix was 63 years old. She was

73 years old at the time she testified. During the time of this incident,

she lived alone in her partly-constructed house after the death of her

husband. She had gone to sleep around 9.30 p.m. on the day in

question. Someone had touched her hand while she was sleeping. She

had asked the person, thinking it was her son, "why did you come now

son, where is the light?" to which the person who touched her hand

replied, "get up, to give you light." Thereafter, the offender had given

two to three blows to the prosecutrix, and she had felt her neck being

squeezed. Thereafter, she had been raped and sexually abused for

about two hours. Then he commanded the prosecutrix to get down

from the bed and threatened her to give him money and jewelry.

4

The prosecutrix had opened the almirah and had given him jewelry.

Thereafter, he had pressed a pillow against the face of the prosecutrix

and had turned her to the other side, and left her, threatening not to

get up until the morning.

Although six grounds of appeal have been stated in the written

submission tendered on behalf of the appellant, the learned Counsel

for the appellant pursued only the following two grounds:

a) The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the

weakness of the evidence in respect of the identification of the

appellant.

b) The learned High Court Judge has failed to give the benefit of

the doubt to the accused-appellant considering the difficulty of

identifying the offender in low light.

Hence, the only issue to be determined in this appeal is whether there

was proper identification of the accused-appellant. The report

pertaining to the identification parade held in the Magistrates Court

of Balangoda has been marked as P-3. Accordingly, PW-1, the

prosecutrix, has identified the appellant in the identification parade

as the person who committed the rape and grave sexual abuse.

Identifying the accused in the identification parade is a piece of

evidence that helps to prove the identity of the accused. However, it is

not conclusive proof regarding the identification, and the said evidence

has to be evaluated with the other circumstances of the case.

In the case at hand, PW-1 stated in her evidence, found at page 96 of

the appeal brief, that William, to whom the prosecutrix had informed

this incident, told her that the villagers who attended a funeral had

told him that this offence may have been committed by the appellant

5

and some other boy. When the appellant and the other person were

drunk and misbehaving at the funeral, the villagers who were there

had said so. Under these circumstances, even if PW-1 did not see who

committed the offences, she could have identified the appellant in the

identification parade because she stated that the appellant is a known

person in the village. Even at the commencement of the identification

parade, objection has been taken on behalf of the appellant that there

was no purpose in holding an identification parade, as the appellant

and PW-1 knew each other.

Therefore, it is necessary to consider carefully the way PW-1 identified

the appellant. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that

PW-1 identified the appellant by seeing only his eyes, according to her

own evidence. The contention of the learned counsel is correct

because, in perusing pages 83 and 102 of the appeal brief, PW-1 has

specifically stated that she identified the appellant when only the eyes

were exposed and the rest of his face was covered with a bedsheet that

was at her home. The learned Deputy Solicitor General appeared for

the respondent submitted that on one occasion, PW-1 stated that she

identified the appellant by his face. (Page 95, last answer) However, it

is apparent when she was questioned whether that person had a

beard, she clearly stated that she was unable to answer that question

because he had covered his face except his eyes. Apart from that, when

PW-13, the woman sub-inspector who investigated this matter, stated

in her evidence that PW-1 described that she saw the eyes of the

person who committed the crime and she remembered him having big

eyes. So, it is apparent that PW-1 had identified the appellant by

seeing only his eyes when the rest of his face was covered.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General appeared for the respondent did

not dispute the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the

6

appellant in respect of the identity of the accused-appellant. However,

she asked the court to consider the fact that PW-1 had the opportunity

to see the offender because the offender was in close proximity to her.

Turnbull rules or guidelines regarding the identification were set out

in the case of Regina V. Turnbull - (1976) 3 WLR 445. According to the

Turnbull rules, it has to be examined closely the circumstances in

which the identification by each witness had been made. How long did

the witness have the accused under observation? At what distance? In

what light? are material factors to be considered. According to the

Turnbull rules, the distance between the witness and the accused is

also a relevant factor in identification. However, these guidelines are

to be applied in instances where the witness could see the face of the

accused. In the instant action, although the offender was in close

proximity to the PW-1, she could not see his face but had only seen

his eyes. Therefore, the issue here is not that she had the opportunity

to see him in close proximity but whether she could identify the

offender by only seeing his eyes.

Another important matter to be considered is that, on page 90 of the

appeal brief, when PW-1 was asked whether there was light, she stated

that she saw the eyes of the appellant and identified him by the light

of the torch in the appellants hand. When a person holds a torch, the

light is usually directed away from him rather than towards him.

Therefore, another doubt arises whether she could identify a person

by seeing only his eyes in this low light emitted by the torch.

Under the above circumstances, I am of the view that the probability

of making a specific and accurate identification of the offender is in

doubt. Reasonable doubt arises as to whether PW-1 has properly

identified the person who committed the offences. The said doubt

becomes more intense as she has not stated about the appellant when

7

making a complaint to the police after the incident. When PW-1 was

questioned about this, she stated that since she did not know the

name of the appellant, she did not mention about him. She stated

clearly in her evidence that she knew the appellant prior to the

incident because he lived in the same village. However, when she gave

her history to the doctor who examined her after the incident, she

stated that on 15th March 2008, an unknown person had sexual

intercourse with her forcibly. PW-5, the doctor also confirmed in his

testimony that PW-1 stated in giving the history that an unknown

person raped her. Hence, it is apparent that if she identified the

appellant at the time of the incident, she should have at least told the

doctor that a known person had raped her. By stating to the doctor

two days after the incident that an unknown person raped her, it is

evident that she had not identified the person who raped her and

sexually abused her.

If the jewelry allegedly robbed from PW-1 were recovered, it would be

a piece of evidence which would help in identifying the offender. In the

absence of jewelry being recovered, there was no other evidence to

establish the identity of the offender.

Therefore, I agree with the contention of the learned counsel for the

appellant that the identity of the appellant is in doubt. No charge could

be proved against the appellant unless his identity could be

established. Accordingly, I hold that it is not proved beyond a

reasonable doubt that the appellant and no one else committed the

offences specified in the indictment.

Accordingly, I set aside the judgment dated 20.12.2019, the

convictions, and the sentences. The accused-appellant is acquitted of

all three charges against him.

The appeal is allowed.
