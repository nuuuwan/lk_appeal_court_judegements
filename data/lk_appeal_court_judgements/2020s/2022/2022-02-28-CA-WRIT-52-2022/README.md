Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner was elected a member of the Mawanella Pradeshiya Sabha (Pradeshiya

Sabha) in 2018 and later was elected as the Chairman of the said Pradeshiya Sabha. The

Petitioner was required to submit a budget for the succeeding year i.e., year 2022

(budget), in terms of the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act No. 15 of 1987, as amended (the Act).

The issue that emerges in this application revolves around the said budget.

Page 4 of 13

In this application, the Petitioner seeks, inter alia, for orders, quashing the Gazette

Notification bearing No. 2262/49 dated 15.01.2022 by which the 1st Respondent

proclaimed that the Petitioner is considered to have resigned from the post of Chairman

and also for orders quashing the Gazette Notification bearing No. 2263/12 dated

19.01.2022 by which the 5th Respondent has scheduled a meeting of the Pradeshiya Sabha

to elect a new Chairman.

The sequence of salient events relevant to this application

The sequence of relevant events derived from the pleadings are laid down in the following

manner due to the special circumstances of this case.

Date Event

18.06.2021 The Petitioner requested all members of the Pradeshiya Sabha

(Members) to submit proposals to be included in the budget 2022.

(Vide - P13)

06.10.2021 The Petitioner issued a reminder to the Members to submit the

proposals. (Vide - P14)

The Petitioner also addressed letters to the OIC of Police Station,

religious leaders and community leaders in the area calling for

proposals for the budget. (Vide - P15A)

18.10.2021 Petitioner informed Members that the draft budget 2022 will be

Members who had not submitted proposals could submit such at the

meeting. (Vide - P16)

22.10.2021 A special meeting was held.

The suggestions made by the Members who attended the meeting

were incorporated into the draft budget

16.12.2021 A special General Meeting was held.

Few members made views against the budget and also three

amendments were proposed.

The said amendments were defeated by majority votes,

However, no vote was taken in respect of passing the budget.

The Petitioner declared that the budget has been duly adopted without

any amendments.

Few members requested for a division.

Page 5 of 13

22.12.2021 The 5th Respondent informed the Petitioner to get the budget duly

passed by the Members in term of section 168 (2) of the Act and the

Pradeshiya Sabha Meeting Rules 1988. (Vide P18)

28.12.2021 As oppose to P18, the Petitioner has written a letter to 5th Respondent

stating that the budget has been duly passed although no vote was

taken on the budget. (Vide - P19)

29.12.2021 The 5th Respondent further informed the Petitioner to submit the

budget in order to get it duly passed by the Council. (Vide - P20)

31.12.2021 In response to P20, the Petitioner sent a letter to the 5th Respondent

stating that the proposed amendments to the budget were duly

considered in terms of section 168 (2) of the Act and that the Council

decided to vote against the said amendments and in the

circumstances, the budget was adopted without any amendments as

contemplated in section 168 of the Act.

15.01.2022 The 1st Respondent published a Gazette Notification bearing No.

2262/49 dated 15.01.2022 marked P20, declaring that the Petitioner

is considered to have resigned from the post of Chairman with effect

from 31.12.2021.

15.01.2022 The 1st Respondent made an order vesting the powers, performance

and functions of the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha in the Vice-

Chairman until the vacancy of the Chairman is filled. (Vide - P23)

19.01.2022 The 5th Respondent has published a Gazette Notification bearing no.

2263/12 dated 19.01.2022 scheduling a meeting of the Pradeshiya

Sabha to elect a new Chairman. (Vide - X)

The concise argument of the Petitioner.

i. The budget has been duly adopted in terms of the provisions of sections 168 & 169

of the Act.

ii. There were no alternative proposals presented by any member apart from the three

amendments which were duly considered and defeated; as such in terms of sections

168 & 169, no items were added or rejected from the budget; as a result, the budget

was duly adopted without any amendments.

Page 6 of 13

iii. As there was no opposition expressed to the budget (apart from the 3 amendments

which were defeated), there is no requirement for the budget to be passed by a

majority vote.

iv. The request for a vote on the budget was made only after the Chairman declared

that the budget had been duly passed and accordingly, there is no necessity for the

budget to be re-submitted; as a result, Petitioner could not be deemed to have

resigned from the post of Chairman.

v. The 1st Respondent is devoid of power and/or authority under the Constitution

and/or any other law to issue Gazette Notification marked P22

vi. The orders/decisions in P22 and P23 are tainted with malice and there is

manifestly a total lack of bona fide on the part of the 1st Respondent as there are

pending litigation (CA/Writ/170/2020 and CA/Writ /383/2020) instituted by the

Petitioner in this Court.

Pending cases filed by the Petitioner in this Court.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the instant application

is distinct from the other similar cases filed before this Court in respect of the issue where

Governor has considered that the Chairman is deemed to have resigned from his post. The

reason given by the learned Presidents Counsel is that the Petitioner has filed two

applications namely CA/Writ/170/2020 and CA/Writ/383/2020 in which the

constitutionality and the extent of the powers of a Governor under the present

Constitution is being challenged and also that such issues are under consideration by

another division of this Court. The Petitioner has annexed copies of the Petitions of both

above cases to the Petition of this case. In CA/Writ/170/2020, the Petitioner seeks for an

order in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing a charge sheet issued against him

whereas in CA/Writ/383/2020, the Petitioner seeks for a writ of certiorari quashing the

appointment of the relevant retired judicial officer to inquire in to such allegations against

the Petitioner. The Petitioner in the said application bearing No. CA/Writ/383/2020

claims that;

a) The term of Sabaragamuwa Provincial council lapsed on or about 27.10.2017;

b) Since 27.10.2017 there has been no Chief Minister, no board of Ministers and no

Provincial Minister in-charge of the subject of Local Government in

Sabaragamuwa province;

Page 7 of 13

c) There was no direction or notice issued by the Minister of the Sabaragamuwa

Provincial Council in charge of the subject of the Local Government, on Petitioner

or on the Mawanella Prasdeshiya Sabha with respect to the Petitioner executing

functions as the Chairman of the Mawanella Pradeshiya Sabha.

d) The Governor appointing the retired judicial officer under section 185(2) of the

Pradeshiyas Sabhas Act usurped the powers of the Minister of the Sabaragamuwa

Provincial Council in charge of the subject of the Local Government.

e) Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council has enacted Statute No. 6 of 1989 which

specifically sets out the procedure to remove the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha

within the Province.

As per the order issued by Court in the application bearing No. CA/Writ/170/2020 on

17.09.2020 (Vide - P12), a decision has been taken to issue notice on the Respondents

based on the grounds that it was necessary for this Court to look in to the issue as to

whether the Governor of the Sabaragamuwa Province enjoys legal powers to take

disciplinary action against the Petitioner during a period where the respective Provincial

Council remains dissolved.

On perusal of the copies of the Petition of the said CA/Writ/170/2020 and CA/Writ

383/2020, it emanates that the questions relating to those two cases are based on the

disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner under section 185 of the Act, which

stipulates provisions for removal of Chairman, Members and also for dissolution of

Pradeshiya Sabha.

The section 185 empowers the relevant Minister, if he is satisfied on the grounds

mentioned in section 185 (1), to remove the Chairman from office or remove all or any of

the Members from office or dissolve the Pradeshiya Sabha. In both the above applications,

the Petitioners argument is that at a time where the Provincial Councils have been

dissolved, the powers vested on the relevant Minister under section 185 would not vest on

the Governor of the Province.

However, what is material in the instant application is to interpret and identify the scope

of the deeming provisions in section 169 of the Act. There is no discretion of the relevant

Minister applicable in operation of the said section 169 and it is only the conduct of the

Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha gives effect to the said provisions of section 169. The

obligation of preparing the budget and the obligation of submitting the budget to the

Council and the obligation of getting the budget passed by the Council is at all times with

Page 8 of 13

the Chairman in terms of sections 168 & 169 of the Act. In the event when the budget is

defeated the obligation of re-submission of the budget is also totally with the Chairman

under section 169 of the Act.

By virtue of section 185 (2) of the Act, the relevant Minister has an obligation to appoint

a retired judicial officer to inquire in to and report upon any of the matters in section 185

(1) before he makes an order to remove the Chairman or any of the Members. In my view,

the scheme of the Act does not provide a mechanism to appoint a retired judicial officer

to inquire in to the affairs relating to passing the budget by the Council. The questions in

the instant application needs specifically an examination on the scope of the deeming

provision of section 169 of the Act. Going by the dictionary meaning, a deeming provision

is a section or clause of a Statute, Regulation or other legal instrument that states how

something is to be treated or regarded.

In the literal sense of section 185, the relevant Minister takes steps to remove a Chairman

or a Member if he is satisfied that there is sufficient proof in respect of the matters in section

185 (1). Minister has the discretion is executing his duties under section 185 (1) whereas

the deeming provision in section 169 become operative upon the conduct of the Chairman

in respect of presenting the budget and getting it approved.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the said two cases which are pending has no

bearing for the examination of the questions of the instant application and it is

unreasonable to hold or block, until the final determination of those two cases, the smooth

functioning of the whole Pradeshiya Sabha which has a bounded duty for its effectiveness

towards the people of the respective area.

The contention of the Respondents in a nutshell

In the instant application also the learned Counsel for several Respondents took the same

line of argument as advanced in the other connected cases. The main contention of

Respondents in this case also that the questions relating to this application have already

been resolved by His Lordship Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere with the agreement of the His

Lordship Justice Mayadunne Corea in four separate cases of this Court. i.e.,

CA/Writ/24/2021, CA/Writ/51/2021, CA/Writ/57/2021 & CA/Writ/61/2021.

Accordingly, the relevant Respondents moved that this application be dismissed in limine.

Thus, it is necessary to ascertain in this case also whether the Petitioner has submitted a

case which is suitable for full investigation and a hearing after issuing notice on all the

Page 9 of 13

Respondents. In the backdrop of the above orders made by this Court and upon the

circumstances, the Court should be satisfied that there is a prima facie case that ought to

be resolved after full argument.

The scope of section 168 and 169 of the Act

The question emanates from this application is whether the Petitioner is entitled to declare

the budget as duly adopted, under sections 168 & 169 of the Act, based on the alleged

reason that there were no alternative proposals presented by Members (apart from the 3

amendments which were duly considered and defeated) and also on the basis that the

budget or any portion of it has not been neither modified nor rejected. It is observed that

the Petitioner has not afforded an opportunity for Members to take a vote on the budget

and the budget he has tabled is relevant to a period after the first two years since the

commencement of the office of the Pradeshiya Sabha.

I have already dealt with and determined similar questions relating to this application in;

a) Madampage Nanda Wijeratne Silva vs. Marshal of the Airforce Roshan

Goonetileke Governor-Western Province & others (CA/Writ/649/2021,

decided on 28.02.2022)

b) Kasudeen Mohomed Nihar vs. Anuradha Yahampath Governor- Eastern

Province & others (CA/Writ/12/2022, decided on 28.02.2022)

c) J. Thilekeratne vs. Hon. M. Herath,Governor-North Central Province & others

(CA/Writ/31/2022, decided on 28.02.2022)

I have extensively considered the submissions made on behalf of the Petitioner as well as

the submissions on behalf of the Respondents which are identical to the view point taken

by the Respondents in all above three cases. I hold that the reasoning given by me to arrive

at the conclusion in those three cases are applicable in relation to the questions in the

instant application as well. I may not reiterate all the reasons given by me in above three

cases here because there are several other cases before this Court with identical or similar

questions and I have taken the same and identical view in regard to the order on issuance

of notice in all such cases.

Page 10 of 13

My findings in the above three cases were mainly based on the precedent set by His

Lordship Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere with agreement of His Lordship Justice Mayadunne

Corea in the below mentioned cases;

a) Wellawattage Sarath Peiris vs. Katunayake Seeduwa Urban Council, Seeduwa

& others (CA/Writ/24/2021, decided on 10.06.2021),

b) Manodara Aacharige Chaminda Sugath, Chairman vs. Anuradha Yahampath,

Governor, Eastern Province & others (CA/Writ/51/2021, decided on

10.06.2021).

c) H.M. Lalantha Sumith Seneviratne vs. Pradeshiya Sabhawa of Padiyathalawa

& others (CA/Writ/57/2021, decided on 10.06.2021)

d) A.P. Ranasinghe Bandara, Chairman vs. Anuradha Yahampath, Governor of

Eastern Province & others (CA/Writ/61/2021, decided on 10.06.2021).

In my order in CA/Writ/31/2021, I have summarized the precedent set in the above four

cases as follows;

i. In terms of section 168 (2) of the Act, the budget shall be passed by the Council.

ii. However, in terms of section 169 of the Act, the budget submitted by the Chairman

during the first two years of the Council shall be considered as the duly adopted

budget, by operation of law, even though the said budget has not been passed by a

majority vote. Moreover, taking a vote even during the first two years is essential.

iii. After the first two years of the Council, the budget at the first submission or at the

re-submission should be passed by majority votes of the Council.

iv. It is a mandatory duty of the Chairman to submit the annual budget and if the

budget is defeated at the first submission, the chairman must re-submit the budget,

for a vote by the Members of the Council.

v. In the event the budget is defeated any time after the first two years and as a result,

if the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha;

a) fails to re-submit the budget and/or

b) fails to get it passed upon re-submission to the Council,

Page 11 of 13

the relevant Chairman is deemed to have vacated his post in terms of the proviso

to section 169.

vi. Even if the Chairman accepts the amendments, modifications, additions to the

budget or to the supplementary budget, the Chairman is subjected to above cardinal

requirements.

Additionally, it is important here also to reiterate the following passage in my order dated

28.02.2022 in CA/Writ/31/2022;

Moreover, the rationale of the decision of the Court in all the above cases in addition to the

provision of the said sections 168 & 169 is based on section 14 (1) of the Act. I also have

observed in my order in CA/Writ/649/2021, the deeming provisions of section 169 of the

Act should be carefully interpreted in line with the basic principles of Democracy and Good

Governance without undermining the consent or the division of the Members of the

Pradeshiya Sabha.

I have drawn my attention to a judgement of the Supreme Court of India and observed in

the case CA/WRIT/ 31/2022 that the provisions of the Act must be read harmoniously

and to give effect to the legislative intention. In Chief Justice of Andhra Pradesh and

another vs. LVA Dikshitutu and others (AIR 1979 SC 193), the Indian Supreme Court

has observed that;

Where two alternative constructions are possible the Court must choose the one which will

be in accord with the other parts of the statute and ensure its smooth, harmonious working,

and eschew the other which leads to absurdity, confusion or friction, contradiction and conflict

between its various provisions or undermines or tends to defeat or destroy the basic scheme

and purpose of the enactment.

Reliefs

The Petitioner seeks, inter alia, for an order in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing

the order made by the 1st Respondent Governor as contained in Gazette Extraordinary

No. 2262/49 dated 15.01.2022 marked P22. The 1st Respondent by way of the said

Gazette Notification has declared that the Petitioner is considered to have resigned from

the post of Chairman with effect from 31.12.2021 due to failure to pass the budget prepared

by the Petitioner under sections 168 & 169 of the Act.

Page 12 of 13

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner argued that the 1st Respondent is devoid

of power to have issued any order under section 223 of the Act read together with section

2 of the Provincial Councils (Consequential Provisions) Act No. 12 of 1989 as the said

section 223 deals only with transitional arrangements of any unforeseen or special

circumstances. This question also has been dealt with by His Lordship Justice Obeyesekere

in CA/Writ/51/2021, analyzing the similar provisions in section 247 of the Urban

Councils Ordinance together with section 2 of the said Act No. 12 of 1989. It is important

to highlight the following paragraph in CA/Writ/51/2021;

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that in any event, the impugned

Order P22 is ultra vires the powers conferred on the 1st Respondent by Section 247 of the

Urban Councils Ordinance and Section 2 of the Provincial Councils (Consequential

Provisions) Act No. 12 of 1989. To me, the series of events that followed the refusal by the

Petitioner to place the re-submitted budget to a vote and have it passed by the Council reflects

the desperation on the part of the Respondents to ensure that the provisions of Section 178A

are complied with. Even if the argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner

is accepted, nothing flows from P22 for the reason that P22 is only an intimation of a

factual position that prevailed as at that date.

The Petitioner further seeks for an order in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the

notice in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2263/12 dated 13.01.2022. The Petitioner

challenges the said order allegedly based on the provisions in section 66G of the Local

Authorities Elections Ordinance (Cap. 262). His Lordship Justice Obeyesekere has

resolved this issue also in CA/Writ/24/2021, observing that the Provincial Commissioner

of Local Government is empowered to in terms of law to fill a vacancy in the office of

Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha.

Therefore, I am not inclined to accept the propositions of the Petitioner based on section

223 of the Act and also on the section 66G of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance

(Cap. 262). On a careful consideration of the whole matter and in light of the reasoning

given in my above orders (CA/Writ/649/2021, CA/Writ/12/2022, CA/Writ/31/2022)

and in view of the legal analysis established in the cases bearing Nos. CA/Writ/24/2021,

CA/Writ/51/2021, CA/Writ/57/2021 and CA/Writ/61/2021, I take the view that the

1st Respondent Governor has given due effect to the provisions of sections 14, 168 and 169

of the Act and lawfully decided that the Petitioner has deemed to have resigned from the

office of Chairman.

Page 13 of 13

I need to reiterate that I am mindful of Basnayake CJ.s statement on the cursus curiae

that developed over the years in this country. He has observed in Bandahamy vs.

Senanayake 62 NLR 313 (p.345) as follows;

Two Judges sitting together also as a rule follow the decisions of two Judges. Where two

Judges sitting together find themselves unable to follow a decision of two Judges, the practice

in such cases is also to reserve the case for the decision of a fuller bench, although the Courts

Ordinance does not make express provision in that behalf as in case of a single Judge.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the questions raised by the Petitioner in the

instant application have already been resolved in the aforesaid orders of this Court.

Therefore, based on the arguability principles that should be adopted in respect of matters

relating to issuance of notice in a juridical review application, I arrive at the conclusion

that there is no arguable case or a prima facie case for this Court to issue formal notice on

the Respondents in this application. Therefore, I proceed to refuse this application.
