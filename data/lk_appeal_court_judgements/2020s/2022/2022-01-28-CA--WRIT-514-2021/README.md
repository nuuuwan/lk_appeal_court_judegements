Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Ministry of Health published a bid notice under the caption of supply of cleaning

services for hospitals and health institutions under National Competitive Bid Invitation

2021/2022 appeared in the Daily News paper on 4th May 2021 (P5). By virtue of the

said bid notice, the Ministry of Health invited bids from registered institutions for the

supply of cleaning services in respect of the hospitals and institutions mentioned in the

said notice for the year 2021/2022. The Petitioners submitted their bids inter alia in respect

of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka for the area including ENT clinic, 18, 45 clinic, X-

ray section & X-ray waste, 15, 16, 62, 63, 64, 66, the garden surrounding the white house,

skin diseases, the garden surrounding the Buddhist center, PHI office, private office, AB

overseers office, ABC Nawaloka surgery, surroundings of Blood Bank, all land portions

surrounding the physical radiation, ward 65. This area of the National Hospital of Sri

Lanka comes under the Tender No. MH/PB/CL/02/2021 as per P5.

The Petitioners and four other bidders including the 13th & 14th Respondents (M/S Super

Shine Services) submitted their bids in relation to the above tender. At the opening of bids,

the Petitioners bid was placed as the 3rd lowest whereas the bids submitted by the 13th &

14th Respondents were placed as the 2nd lowest. The lowest bid has been rejected at the

appeal stage for the reason of non-compliance of tender conditions. The Petitioners state

that the bids submitted by the 13th & 14th Respondents are materially non responsive to

several vital and mandatory tender conditions and therefore must necessarily be rejected.

As per the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners, the application of the

Petitioners is mainly focused on the alleged failure of the 13th & 14th Respondents, as

mentioned below, to satisfy and be compliant with principle eligibility criteria included in

the bid notice;

Page 7 of 22

a) failure of the 13th & 14th Respondents to submit a worth certificate in Form Gen.

170 for the stipulated values for the hospitals and health institutions.

b) failure to submit the letter issued by the Bank which with the contractor is engaged

in transaction to the effect that bank overdraft (OD) facilities could be provided for

the amount mentioned in the table for each of the hospitals and institutes.

c) 13th & 14th Respondents have quoted unrealistic prices which renders their bid

unlawful, illegal and in-eligible and non-responsive.

d) the contravention of the Clause 15.2 of the tender conditions.

e) the failure and neglect by the State Respondents to follow the procedure mandated

by Clause 7.9.11 of the Procurement Guidelines in respect of unrealistic prices.

Worth Certificate

The Petitioners averse in the Petition that to the best of their knowledge, the 13th & 14th

Respondents have not duly submitted the mandatory worth certificate which is a

requirement in terms of Clause 1.VIII of the tender which should be considered as a major

deviation. The Petitioners have originated this argument based on the copy of the worth

certificate bearing serial No. A 108577 submitted by the 13th &14th Respondents marked

as R12. The said worth certificate R12 has been issued for the value of Rs. 1 million.

The Petitioners contention is that 13th & 14th Respondents should have submitted a worth

certificate to the value of Rs. 10 million as those Respondents have submitted bids for

several hospitals and institutes. The value of the worth certificate that has to be submitted

in respect of several hospitals is mentioned in the bid notice marked P5.

The 13th & 14th Respondents and 1st to 12th Respondents in their respective Statement of

Objections denying the relevant averments in the Petition averse that the 13th & 14th

Respondents have duly complied with the tender conditions by tendering all the

mandatory documents and thereby ensuring compliance with the provisions of the

Government Procurement Guidelines. The 13th & 14th Respondents submit that the

Petitioners by way of Motion dated 02.11.2021 tendered the bid document of the 13th &

14th Respondents marked as I. According to 13th & 14th Respondents, such bid document

is a confidential document in the possession of the Procurement Committee of the

Ministry of Health and the Petitioners have not properly divulged how they have obtained

such confidential documents. Further, the 13th & 14th Respondents submit that filing of the

said document is absolutely shocking and indicates that the Petitioners have attempted to

win at all costs without having any regard to professional and ethical conduct. This Court

Page 8 of 22

makes the observation that the party who furnishes such purported confidential documents

in a judicial review application should mandatorily divulge the source of procuring any

such documents in order to avoid unfair and unethical competition.

The learned State Counsel who was permitted to correct the markings on the documents

annexed to the Statement of Objections of the 1st to 12th Respondents, has submitted a

worth certificate marked R12 bearing the serial No. A 108570 which is a document in

addition to the worth certificate marked X2. In the said worth certificate marked R12,

the relevant Divisional Secretary has indicated that a value of Rs. 1 million out of 10

million has been released. However, no evidence has been placed by parties as to whether

separate worth certificates have been annexed to their respective bids.

In response to the argument raised by the Petitioners on the worth certificate, the learned

State Counsel asserts that the wordings of the tender condition 1.VIII requires the

submission of separate worth certificates only if the bidder is submitting bids for more than

one hospital. The learned State Counsel further submits that the requirement to submit

multiple worth certificates for different premises of the same hospital (albeit on different

tenders) does not arise when interpreting the said tender condition in the literal sense.

The said condition 1.VIII is as follows;

06 170

( ) (

/

/ .

.)

The English translation of the said complete Clause is as follows;

The worth certificate in Form Gen. 170 for the following values for hospitals and

health institutions obtained from the Divisional Secretary within 06 months (The

original). (If the contractor is submitting bids for several hospitals/ institutions, the

certificate should be for the total value or more of such hospitals/ institutes).

Page 9 of 22

Further, the annual value should be as mentioned below according to the hospital/

institute you apply for.

Annual Value

a) Health Ministry/ Teaching Hospitals

and General Hospitals

Rs. 1,000,000.00

b) Base Hospitals, District Hospitals and

Divisional (pradeeshiya) Hospitals

Rs. 500,000.00

c) Health Institutions Rs. 300,000.00

A careful examination of the wordings in the above clause indicates that the requirement

of submitting a worth certificate for the total value of all hospitals and institutions arises

only if the bidder submits bids in respect of hospitals other than the National hospital of

Sri Lanka. In other words, if a bidder submits several bids in respect of one hospital, there

is no specific requirement laid down in the above clause for such bidder to tender a worth

certificate considering the value of several sites of the same hospital. I have arrived at that

conclusion specifically because of the wording in that clause particularly to say if the

contractor is submitting bids for several hospitals/institutions..

Now, it is important to ascertain as to whether 13th & 14th Respondents have become

successful in view of several bids in respect of hospitals other than the National Hospital

of Sri Lanka.

The Petitioners have filed in this Court, two other applications bearing Nos. CA Writ

515/21 & CA Writ 516/21 of which the parties have agreed to be bound by the final

determination of the instant case. As mentioned above, the instant application is in respect

of the below mentioned areas/sites at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka;

ENT clinic, 18, 45 clinic, X-ray section & X-ray waste, 15, 16, 62, 63, 64, 66, the

garden surrounding the white house, skin diseases, the garden surrounding the

Buddhist center, PHI office, private office, AB overseers office, ABC Nawaloka

surgery, surroundings of Blood Bank, all land portions surrounding the physical

radiation, ward 65. (Tender No. MH/PB/CL/01/2021)

The connected case no. CA Writ 515/21 is in respect of the below mentioned areas/sites

at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka as mentioned below;

Page 10 of 22

Area including ward Nos 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 & 65 AB,

Operation Theaters, OPD, ECG rooms, Vancular Lab, Zone Surrounding

Bodhiya, Ground surrounding. (Tender No. MH/PB/CL/03/2021)

The other connected case no. CA Writ 516/21 is in respect of the below mentioned

areas/sites at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka;

Area including wards 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, Laboratory,

Mortuary, Overseers office, Insulator area. (Tender No. MH/PB/CL/05/2021)

In my view, there are no separate institutions cited in the above areas/sites and all the

places mentioned therein are wards, clinics or different sections in the same hospital, i.e.,

The National Hospital of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, it is obvious that the 13th & 14th

Respondents in regard to the above three tenders have submitted bids for several

sites/areas of the same hospital and not in respect of other hospitals or institutions.

The Petitioners laying aside the submissions on behalf of the 1st to 12th Respondents who

emphasis that the tenders in respect of the said National Hospital must be treated as one

for the purpose of the worth certificate, submit that;

i. If a bidder tenders for all nine sites, the value of the worth certificate must be

more than Rs. 9 million;

ii. If the Respondents contention is upheld then if a bidder submits 9 bids for the first

9 tenders which are all at the said National Hospital, the bidder would need to;

a) Submit worth certificate only to the value of Rs. 1 million

b) Loan facility, as required, only for one tender

c) Bid security as only value for one tender and also

d) Pay only for one bid document

iii. The total bid value for the first 9 sites, i.e., the separate sites of the National

Hospital of Sri Lanka, exceeds Rs. 250 million for the year and therefore, it is trite

that a sum such as that cannot be backed or secured by a worth certificate of Rs. 1

million.

In my view, one cannot compare the requirement of having a worth certificate with the

concept of submitting a bid security. The bid security is intended to deter bidders from

withdrawing their bids and if the bidder withdraws his bid prior to end of the bid validity

period or refuses to sign the contract if selected, the procuring entity will automatically

Page 11 of 22

forfeit the bid security amount. In terms of clause 5.3.11 (b) of the Procurement

Guidelines, a bid security is obtained to ensure the following;

i. that the bidder will not withdraw or modify the Bid during the period of validity;

ii. that the bidder will agree to an adjusted bid price after the correction of arithmetical errors,

pursuant to the criteria described in the bidding documents;

iii. that the bidder will sign the contract if the contract is awarded within the validity period

of the bid; and

iv. that the bidder will submit a performance security prior to the deadline specified in the

bidding documents.

Meantime, it is observed that the worth certificate is an instrument issued by the Divisional

Secretary (DS) by virtue of the powers vested in him to that effect. The DS issues such

certificate in General Form 170 based on the information he receives from the relevant

Grama Sewa Niladari. As per the said General Form 170, the relevant DS certifies that a

particular land belongs to the person who requests for such certificate. He arrives at that

conclusion on the contents available on the face of a deed tendered to him by such person.

Further, the DS assigns a value to such land and certifies according to his knowledge and

belief that the land/lands he refers to in the said form are free from any debt including

mortgages and also it is not subjected to any partition case or any other litigation.

Therefore, the purpose of obtaining a bid security is completely different as regards to the

requirement of submitting a worth certificate. In view of the contents of the format for bid

security referred to in the tender conditions, no interpretation could be formulated

requiring only one bid security, with the value for one site to be submitted for several bids

even in relation to different sites/areas within the same hospital.

The Petitioners in paragraph 26 of their written submissions averse that Petitioners now

have the supporting documentation to establish that the 13th & 14th Respondents had bid

for at least 7 hospitals and institutions under P5. The Petitioners further averse that due

to the pleadings being closed, they are now unable to tender the same to Court which

allegedly establishes that the 13th & 14th Respondents have submitted at least 7 tenders and

on that basis, the worth certificate should be Rs 7 to 8 million at the very least. It is an

admitted fact among the parties that the 13th & 14th Respondents have been awarded

tenders for aforementioned three sites of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka.

Therefore, the alleged failure of the 13th & 14th Respondents to consider the value of above

three main areas as mentioned in the bid notice P5 cannot be considered as a failure of

Page 12 of 22

non-compliance of the tender conditions. The 13th & 14th Respondents are getting this

benefit by interpreting the relevant clause in the literal sense due to the intentional or

unintentional limitations imposed in drafting the said notice P5 or tender conditions.

Had the Procurement Committee intended to invite the bidders to submit a worth

certificate to the total value of the several sites of the same hospital that could have been

expressly stated in those conditions. In my view, this is the best interpretation that I could

give upon the said clause 1.VIII in order to afford equal opportunity to every bidder. It is

the duty of the Procurement Committee to express all bidding conditions without creating

any ambiguity within such several conditions. In the circumstances, I am unable to accept

the proposition of the Petitioners on the worth certificate submitted by the 13th & 14th

Respondents.

Requirement of submitting a letter issued by the Bank

The Petitioners further argue that the 13th & 14th Respondents have failed to submit a letter

issued by the Bank in terms of Clause 1.IX of the conditions of the tender. The said Clause

provides that the bidder should furnish a letter issued by the Bank which with the

contractor is engaged in, to the effect that bank overdraft (OD) facilities could be provided

for the amount mentioned in the table for each of the hospitals and institutes. Further, it

stipulates that if the contractor is submitting bids for several hospitals/institutes, the

certificate should be for the total value or more of such hospitals/institutes.

The 13th & 14th Respondents have annexed to their Statement of Objections, a letter issued

by the Bank of Ceylon addressed to the Chairman of Health Ministry Procurement

Committee dated 07.05.2021 (marked X3). Accordingly, the 13th & 14th Respondents

complain that the Petitioners have strived to misdirect this Court by averting false facts.

The 1st Petitioner in his Counter Affidavit dated 08.12.2021 in response to the said letter

marked X3 states that the 13th & 14th Respondents have failed to tender letters issued by

the bank in respect of the amounts mentioned in the table for each of the hospitals and

institutes and instead those Respondents have submitted only a confirmation of account

balances.

The Petitioners in paragraph 67 of their Petition (submitted along with an affidavit) state

as follows;

The Petitioners further state that according to the aforesaid Clause the 13th Respondent is

required to submit a letter thereof with a total value more than Rs. 6,758,500.00. However,

Page 13 of 22

to the best of the knowledge of the Petitioners the 13th and 14th Respondents have not provided

a letter thereof with a total value more than Rs. 6,758,500.00 wherein makes the bid

submitted by the 13th and 14th Respondents non-responsive and necessarily be rejected.

However, it appears that the Bank of Ceylon in the said letter marked X3 has confirmed

account balances therein as at 05.05.2021. Moreover, the said Bank has mentioned in the

same letter that a Permanent Overdraft limit of Rs. 11,538,500.00 exists against ten fixed

deposit accounts of which the account numbers and the respective values are stipulated

therein. There is no specific counter argument raised by the Petitioner in this regard in

their Counter Objections.

Therefore, I am not inclined to accept the argument raised by the Petitioners against the

13th & 14th Respondents with regard to the alleged failure of submitting a letter issued by

the Bank.

Unrealistic prices

The learned Counsel for the Petitioners in his written submissions states that one of the

pillars of this case is rooted on the submissions that the 13th & 14th Respondents have

submitted wholly and ex facie unrealistic prices in the tender.

The Petitioners have invited the attention of this Court to the price comparison between

the Petitioners and 13th &14th Respondents in respect of the;

a) Monthly chemical list -Table 1.1 (mentioned in the Written submissions of

the Petitioners)

b) Monthly equipment list -Table 1.2 (mentioned in the Written submissions of

the Petitioners)

c) Annual equipment list -Table 1.3 (mentioned in the Written submissions of

the Petitioners)

The Petitioners referring to above price comparison assert that the prices submitted by the

13th & 14th Respondents contain wholly unrealistic prices. For example, the Petitioners

pointed out that a large garbage bag (thickness over 200 microns) cannot be purchased for

Rs. 6.00 (wholesale price) and also that those Respondents have quoted the same Rs. 6.00

price for a small garbage bag (thickness over 200 microns). The Petitioners further referring

to the annexure marked as 13R2a submit that a small garbage bag with a thickness of

25.1 microns which is far below the requirement of 200 microns is priced at Rs. 11.00 per

Page 14 of 22

bag and further, it is evident that a large garbage bag with thickness over 200 microns

cannot be purchased at Rs. 6.00 in Sri Lanka.

Referring to the invoice marked as 13R1b (an invoice obtained from D & J Hitinawaththa

Products), the Petitioners highlight the prices therein and submit that;

a) 1 liter of air freshener cannot be purchased at Rs. 50.00

b) 1 kg of dishwash powder cannot be purchased at Rs. 35.00

c) Glass cleaner of 1 liter cannot be purchased at Rs. 40.00

d) 1 liter of pine disinfectant cannot be purchased at Rs. 40.00

e) 1 liter of toilet cleaner cannot be purchased at Rs. 40.00

f) 1 liter tile cleaner bottle cannot be purchased at Rs. 55.00

In view of Clause 15.2 of the tender conditions, the prices offered for annual chemicals

and equipment cost mentioned in Annexure V (annexure to the tender conditions) should

be reasonable at market prices. Accordingly, the Petitioners argue that prices should be on

par with the market prices and whereas the 13th & 14th Respondents have submitted wholly

unrealistic prices in respect to chemical, annual equipment and monthly equipment. On

those grounds the contention of the Petitioners is that such unrealistic prices amount to a

major deviation as it vitiates Clause 7.9.11 of the Government Procurement Guideline.

In response to the Petitioners argument on unrealistic prices, the 1st to 12th Respondents

submit as follows;

i. At the appeal stage, the Petitioners contended that the monthly allocation by the

successful bidder for the chemicals, equipment would not be sufficient. The insufficiency

of the monthly financial allocation was made in comparison to that of the Petitioners.

ii. However, at the argument stage before your Lordships Court, the Petitioners alleged that

the chemical cost and the cost of certain equipment quoted by the successful bidder are

unrealistic. To buttress the argument, the Counsel for the Petitioner relied on a garbage

bag that was bought at the retail price from a leading supermarket and relied on the price

difference quoted by the successful bidder and the Petitioners in relation to a mop. (vide

page 11 of the Written Submission of the 1st to 12th Respondents)

In addition to the above argument, 1st to 12th Respondents submit that the bidding

document has set out only the chemical composition which inter alia requires that the

chemical products have to be certified by SLS or ITI; the bidding document does not

Page 15 of 22

impose a brand name and therefore, permitting the prospective bidders to quote prices of

any brand so long as the chemical products meet the standardization requirements set out

therein. Those Respondents further submit that the prospective bidder is required to state

the (a) brand name, (b) monthly requirement and (c) monthly cost and it is of significance

that the Petitioners in their bidding document have failed to specify the monthly

requirement and therefore, the information submitted by the Petitioners is incomplete.

Accordingly, the Respondents contend that the information submitted by the successful

bidder in respect of the said Annexure V is full and complete and the bidding document

furnished by the Petitioners is flawed owing to incomplete information submitted therein.

The 1st to 12th Respondents further assert that the Petitioners in their bidding document

have failed to submit information in respect of Annexure IV and also that the cost for the

items contained therein is not set out anywhere in the bid document. According to those

Respondents the overhead cost which is the cost for the day-today operations of the

Petitioners business is excessively higher than that of the successful bidders. Based on

those grounds, the Respondents argue that the competitive advantage the successful bidder

has over chemical cost due to his capacity to manufacture chemicals and purchase

ingredients at wholesale price cannot be held against the successful bidder.

The main contention of the 13th & 14th Respondents is that, it is not them but the Petitioners

who have submitted a bid with unrealistically high prices for the items with a large profit

margin which would eventually cause a great loss to the State. The Respondents averse as

follows;

1. that most of the prices offered by the Petitioners are similar to the retail price of the

local market which cannot be expected by an experienced janitorial service provider

as;

a) naturally any service agency should have mechanism to minimize their expenditure

while securing the quality of service and goods, in order to gain profit from the

business,

b) therefore, there may have tendency of any agency to purchase goods in lots for

wholesale price and/or sometimes they may purchase raw materials and may have

mechanism of manufacturing certain items.

Page 16 of 22

2. that in the event of using machines as polishers, Grass cutting machines, water

suction machines, etc. if there are previously purchased machines which are in good

serviceable quality, they might use those machines for new projects and only claim

some depreciation value from the government.

3. that is one of the reasons for which the Respondents prices are lower than the

Petitioners prices. (vide paragraphs 12 and 13 of the statement of Objections

of the 13th &14th Respondents)

The 13th & 14th Respondents continuously posed the question during the argument as to

why the Petitioners do not have items (such as polisher, grass cutting machine, water

suction machine, pressure washer etc.) that have already been purchased and are in good

and serviceable conditions as the Petitioners have been providing janitorial services for a

period over 20 years. Accordingly, the Respondents argue that there is no necessity to buy

brand new equipment and quote brand new prices and strive to have a large profit margin

ultimately causing heavy loss to the State.

Now, I advert to the relevant provisions of the Procurement Guidelines 2006, (Goods &

Works) relating to unrealistic rates;

Clause 7.9.11, upon selection of the lowest substantially responsive Bid:

a) If such bidder has quoted unrealistically low rates on critical or very important

items, the bidder shall be requested to prove to the satisfaction of the TEC, how the bidder

intends to procure such items/perform the Works/provide the Services as per the quoted

rates, for such purposes the bidder may be asked to provide a rate analysis.

b) If the TEC is of the view that the justification/explanation provided by the bidder is

unacceptable, and hence the bidder would fail in the performance of his obligations within

the quoted rates, such Bid may be rejected.

c) If the justification/explanation of the bidder is acceptable, the TEC should proceed with

the evaluation.

d) If the TEC continues to entertain some doubt about the contractors/suppliers ability to

procure such items/perform the Works/provide the Services as per the quoted rates despite

explanation/justification provided, a higher performance security may be requested to

mitigate such risks.

e) If the bidder refuses to provide such additional performance security, his Bid shall be

rejected. (Emphasis added)

Page 17 of 22

On careful examination of the said Clause, it is apparent that the provisions of the said

Clause are limited to unrealistically low rates on critical or very important items. It is

obvious that the subject tender is to get the services of janitorial cleaning services. A

Janitorial Services company will take care of day today cleaning duties and keep the

premises clean and well maintained. Those duties may include cleaning of rooms,

kitchens, toilets and also sweeping, mopping, vacuuming, dusting and emptying trash. In

terms of Clause 24 of the tender conditions, the details of the areas & the premises that are

to be cleaned and the type of the cleaning job to be carried out can be obtained by the Head

of the Institution and additionally Clause 40 also describes certain duties of the tenderer.

Therefore, it is observed that the subject tender is not to purchase any medical equipment,

mops, garbage bags etc., but only to get janitorial cleaning services. In a tender to procure

medical equipment, such medical equipment has to be considered as critical or very

important items. However, when the tender is to provide janitorial services, a question

arises as to whether;

i. monthly chemicals such as liquid detergent, bleaching powder, turpentine, air

freshener, red polish, glass cleaner, tile cleaner etc.

ii. monthly equipment such as commode brushers, mops, brooms, cobweb dusters,

glaus pairs, dusters, dust pans

iii. annul equipment such as mamoties, garden rakes, hand axes, knifes, water suction

machines, pressure washers, garden forks, digging bars, garden hoses, plant water

buckets, boots, ladders, wheelbarrows, vacuum cleaners

comes within the interpretation of critical or very important items. In the instant case

successful bidders main duty is to provide cleaning services utilizing such chemicals and

equipment.

It is observed that the tender conditions impose several safeguards in the event the

successful bidder fails to comply with such conditions. In terms of Clause 17 of the tender

conditions, the Secretary to the Ministry of Health has the power to (a) stop the services,

(b) call for fresh tenders or (c) take any other action in an event the successful bidder fails

to provide a satisfactory service. The Clause 26 provides strict requirements to be obliged

by a successful bidder in complying with the composition requirement and the

requirements set out in its Annexures III, IV and V. The Clause 35.5 is also an attractive

safeguard stipulated in the tender conditions and the said Clause 35.5 is as follows;

.

In view of those provisions, supply of the chemicals and equipment are regularly

monitored by the hospital authorities and in an event of a failure of the successful bidder,

such authorities are empowered to discontinue the services and take necessary actions.

Therefore, I am of the view that, by reason of the special circumstances of this case, the

chemicals and the items referred to by the Petitioners to establish alleged unrealistic prices

cannot be directly considered as critical items under Clause 7.9.11 of the Procurement

Guidelines, although, those chemicals and other items are very important and essential

for the successful bidder to carry out the cleaning duties.

I have come to the above conclusion on a careful consideration of the whole matter and

also based on the reasons of the special circumstances exclusive to this case. My above

findings no way should be interpreted for a bidder who provides services such as cleaning

to quote inordinate prices. In other words, such bidders should not be able to quote for

example, Rs. 1.00 for each tool or for items such as garbage bags. This issue has to be

examined on an overall conspectus as the main items such as wages of the employees at

any time during the tender process cannot be compromised at any cost and such items

always should be in accordance with the existing laws of the country. If a bidder could

provide tools or machines without incurring any capital expenditure, that aspect has to be

considered in view of striking a balance between the purported unrealistic prices and the

maximum advantage to the procuring entity.

Municipal Commissioner and others1; ii) Rajapaksha Pathiranage Namal Kumara vs.

Susantha Attanayake2; iii) Thajudeen vs. Sri Lanka Tea Board and another3; iv) Dr.

Puvanendran and another vs. Premasiri and two others4, assert that the issue on unrealistic

prices are disputed facts and this Court does not have the expertise to consider matters

relating to the evaluation of the financial responsiveness of the bidders. The Respondents

submit that there was no necessity for the TEC to request a rate analysis or to impose an

additional performance security as the TEC did not entertain any doubt as to the ability

of the successful bidder to procure items and/or services. It is important to note that,

although the Petitioners have invited this Court to take Judicial Notice of the prices

indicated in the tables mentioned in the pleadings of the Petitioners, no substantive proof

has been submitted for the perusal of this Court establishing the accurate retail and

wholesale rates separately.

The Procurement Appeal Board (PAB), upon the appeal dated 30.08.2021 lodged by the

Petitioners has considered the objections on unrealistic prices raised by the Petitioners at

the appeal stage. The PAB after investigating at the appeal stage, the objections raised by

the Petitioners and the other unsuccessful bidders, has made its determination on

24.09.2021. The Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) recommended that the tender be

awarded to 13th & 14th Respondents ensuring maximum benefit to the State and the PAB

has endorsed such recommendation of the TEC. The members of the TEC and the PAB

were of the opinion that the prices quoted by the 13th & 14th Respondents are not unrealistic

Therefore, I am convinced that the question of unrealistic prices has been examined to a

considerable extent by the TEC and the PAB. Moreover, PAB has ordered to include the

conditions and orders imposed by their order dated 24.09.2021 in the Agreement that

would be entered in to with the successful bidder. Therefore, I am inclined to accept to a

greater extent the proposition of the Respondents that this Court is unable to conduct an

investigation on such disputed facts.

It is important to note that the judicial review is concerned, not with the decision but with

the decision making process5. As mentioned in the following paragraph, in the case of

2 CA (Writ) 240/2017 (decided on 04.04.2019) 3 1981 2 Sri L.R. 471 4 2009 2 Sri.

Developments vs. Covent Garden [2012] EWHC 2546 6, the Court is reviewing a

decision solely to see whether or not there was a manifest error and/or whether the process

was in some way unfair;

Under the 2006 Regulations as amended, the principal way in which an unsuccessful bidder,

such as the claimants, can challenge the proposed award of a contract to another bidder is to

show that the public body's evaluation of the rival bids either involved a manifest error or was

in some way unfair or arose out of unequal treatment. Accordingly, in deciding such claims,

the court's function is a limited one. It is reviewing the decision solely to see whether or not

there was a manifest error and/or whether the process was in some way unfair. The court is

not undertaking a comprehensive review of the tender evaluation process; neither is it

substituting its own view as to the merits or otherwise of the rival bids for that already reached

by the public body.

Conclusion

In view of the foregoing, it is my considered view that there are no sufficient grounds to

restrain or prevent the 1st to 12th Respondents from proceeding in respect of the agreement

already entered in to between the Ministry of Health and the 13th &14th Respondents.

Furthermore, I am of the view that there are no sufficient grounds to quash the decisions

of the 3rd to 7th Respondents taken during the tender process.

In terms of clause 7.7.1 (a) of the Government Procurement Guidelines of 2006 on (Goods

and Works), the purpose of a bid evaluation is to determine the lowest evaluated

substantially responsive bid out of the bids received. Therefore, taking all the

circumstances in this application in to consideration and based on my above findings, I

hold that this bid evaluation has been conducted by the 1st to 12th Respondents in an

acceptable manner by awarding the tender to the least responsive bidder, the 13th & 14th

Respondents whilst ensuring the best interest of the State. Amerasinghe J., in Smithkline

Beecham Biologicals S.A. and another vs. State Pharmaceutical Corporation of Sri

Lanka and others (1997 3 Sri. L. R. 20) has been held;

6Also see - Amey vs. Scottish Ministers [2012] CSOH 181 and Lion Apparel Systems vs. Firebuy [2007] EWHC 2179

I understand this to mean that the procedure relating to Government procurements should

ensure the most favourable conditions for the advancement of the People by obtaining

"financially the most advantageous and qualitatively the best supplies for the country." What

is "financially the most advantageous and qualitatively the best supplies for the country" is

pre-eminently a matter of policy that the Government, which is accountable to the People,

must decide...

The other factor of concern is whether the low prices presented by the 13th & 14th

Respondents have created a market monopoly restricting the opportunities for other

bidders. In addition to my above findings, I am of the view that the nature of the agreement

and the circumstances surrounding each case play a prominent role when coming in to

conclusion whether the lower prices have created a market monopoly restricting the

entrance to trade. In the case of Union of India and Others vs. Hindustan Development

Corporation and Others SC 1994 AIR 988, it was stated as follows;

..however, the determination whether such agreement unreasonably restrains the

trade depends on the nature of the agreement and on the surrounding circumstances that give

rise to an inference that the parties intended to restrain the trade and monopolise the same.

A mere offer of a lower price by itself does not manifest the requisite intent to gain

monopoly and in the absence of a specific agreement by way of a concerted action suggesting

conspiracy, the formation of a cartel among the producers who offered such lower price cannot

readily be inferred. In the instant case. Therefore, no conclusion can be

reached definitely that offer of the price of Rs 67,000 by itself was predatory and the

manufacturers who offered such a price consequently formed a cartel

Unrealistic or predatory pricing is a subset of unfair price and as the unfair price has not

been defined anywhere, the unfairness has to be determined on the basis of the facts of

each case. The unfairness has to be examined in relation to the customer or the competitor.

Therefore, I am of the view that in a judicial review application, the Court should intervene

if it appears that unrealistic rates have been adopted in order to create a trade monopoly

or any other adverse and illegal agenda.

It is observed that, the Petitioners were providing services to the National Hospital of Sri

Lanka at the time the procuring entity called for bids by P5. The 1st to 12th Respondents

assert that the motive of the Petitioners in the instant application was to seek an extension

of the said previous contract and to have a fresh contract awarded at a higher price when

Page 22 of 22

the successful bidder has quoted a lower price. The Respondents contention in this regard

is that the conduct of the Petitioners is indicative that the Petitioners are seeking to

manipulate the tender process for their financial advantage, with the objective of

sustaining a monopoly over the janitorial service in public hospital.

Therefore, on a careful consideration of the whole matter including the events relating to

the decisions made by the TEC and PAB, I have come to the conclusion that the

Petitioners are not entitled to any relief as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition of the

Petitioners. In the circumstances, I proceed to dismiss this application. I order no costs.
