Every precaution should be taken to see that they are so, and, in particular, to exclude any suspicion of unfairness or risk of erroneous identification through the witness's attention is directed especially to the suspected person instead of equally to all the persons paraded.\" \"The suspect should be placed among persons (if practicable 8 or more).\" \"Occasionally all members of a group are possible suspects. This may happen where police officers are involved (e.g., an allegation concerning a police officer which can be narrowed down to many officers who were on duty at the time and place in question.) In such circumstances, an identification parade should not include more than two of the possible suspects; e.g., if there were 12 police officers on duty at the time and place in question, there should be at least six parades, each including ten officers who were not implicated and not more than two who might have been; twelve possible suspects should not be paraded together.\"",

    "text": "It was held in Dana Yadav v. the State of Bihar, (2002) 7 SCC 295, evidence of Identification Parade is not substantive evidence whereas evidence given in the court, is. However, when a witness correctly identified the accused at the parade but not in court the evidence of the Magistrate, who conducted the parade that the witness correctly identified the accused at the parade, supported by the remarks of the trial Judge regarding the demeanour of the witness that he was frightened and was unable to recognise the accused at the trial, was sufficient to convict the accused. In the case of R. Shaji v. the State of Kerala, (2013) 14 SCC 266, it was held that it is pertinent to note that the holding of Identification parade is not compulsory. Where the witnesses were well acquainted with the accused and the incident was also widely covered by media, it was held that the non-holding of the identification parade was not fatal to the prosecution case. As to when an identification parade may be necessary was explained by the Supreme Court of India in Jadunath Singh v. the State of U.P. (1970) 3 SCC 518 that Of course, if the prosecution fails to hold an identification parade on the plea that the witnesses already knew the accused well and it transpires in the court of trial that the witnesses did not know the accused previously, the prosecution would run the risk of losing its case. It seems to us that if there is any doubt in the matter, the prosecution should hold an identification parade. In Rajesh Govind Jagesha vs the State of Maharashtra (1999) 8 SCC 428, where identification parade was held after an inordinate delay of about five weeks from the arrest of the accused, the explanation for the delay was not trustworthy. Plea as to the non-availability of a Magistrate in a city like Bombay though the investigating agency was not obliged to get the parade conducted from a specified Magistrate, was not accepted. It was held that the accused was entitled to benefit of the doubt. Thus, the identification parades belong to the stage of the investigation, and there is no provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure that obliges the investigating agency to hold, or confers a right upon the accused to claim a test identification parade. They do not constitute substantive evidence and these parades are essentially governed by Section 162 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure. Failure to hold an identification parade would not make inadmissible the evidence of identification in court. The weight to be attached to such identification should be a matter for the courts of fact and it was held in the case of Malkhan Singh v. the State of M.P., (2003) 5 SCC 746. In the present case, PW 1 testified that the appellants were shown to him in the police station before the identification parade was held. The police officer who testified tried to hide the fact that the police showed the appellants to PW 1 inside the police station. The learned counsel for the 2nd accused-appellant says that the state has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The only evidence to connect the appellant with the offence he is accused of is the identification and the said identification cannot be relied upon.",

Considering the evidence mentioned above, it can be concluded with certainty that the complainant identified the two accused-appellants inside the shop at the time of the robbery. Therefore, there can be no doubt about the identification of two accused-appellants considering the above-mentioned authorities. I am satisfied that the prosecution has proved this case beyond a reasonable doubt. In my view, there is overwhelming evidence in this case of the presence of the first and second accused-appellants at the scene of the crime during the time of the robbery. For all these reasons the conviction of the two appellants is affirmed. Having regard to the facts and legal principles involved in the present matter in question, this appeal has failed to hold any merit. Thus, the conviction and the sentence should stand and therefore is affirmed. Appeal dismissed.",
