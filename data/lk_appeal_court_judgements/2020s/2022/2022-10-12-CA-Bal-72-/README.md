MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant matter has been filed to obtain bail for the suspect namely

Kadupitige Jayantha Lakshman Dharmasena, under the Provisions of

the Assistance to and Protection of victims of Crime and Witnesses Act,

No. 04 of 2015. The suspect in the instant matter had been initially

arrested for an offence of sexual harassment of a minor on 03 /07/2020.

The suspect had been enlarged on bail for the said offence on

12/08/2020.

But on 11/01/2021 the virtual complainant had made a complaint against

the suspect for assaulting and extorting money from him. On 14/01/2021

the bail of the said suspect had been cancelled in terms of Section 14 of

the Bail Act and on 15/02/2021 the police had reported facts to the

Magistrate under the instant Act. The suspect had been in remand since

then.

The main contention of the counsel for the suspect is the period in

remand of the suspect without any investigations being concluded nor

any judicial proceedings taking place.

The State Counsel appearing for the Respondents vehemently objected

to the application stating that the petitioner had not averred any

exceptional circumstances.

Having considered the submissions of both parties this Court observes

that in the instant matter the suspect had been in remand since

14/01/2021, but the Respondents have failed to conclude investigations

or institute proceedings against the substantive matter and the instant

matter, which this Court thinks is in discord with his personal liberty.

The instant Act has been enacted to safeguard the rights of Victims of

Witnesses but it also says that matters filed under this Act should be

given precedence. But in the instant matter the objectives of the Act had

not been achieved and it is exceptional enough to consider bail for the

instant suspect.

The term exceptional has not been defined in the Act, but in cases so far

decides have concluded that exceptionality defers from case to case. In

the instant Act we observe the exceptionality lies in the period in remand

of the suspect without investigations and judicial proceedings taking

place for the substantive and the instant matter.

As such the instant application for bail is allowed and the suspect namely

Kadupitige Jayantha Lakshman Dharmasena is enlarged on the following

conditions of bail.

01. A cash bail of Rs. 50,000/-

02. Two sureties to the value of 100,000/- each.

03. The suspect to report to the relevant Police Station on every last

Sunday of the month.

04. The suspect is hereby severely warned not to interfere with the

complainant or the family members. If it is reported the instant

bail order would be cancelled.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to convey the instant order

to the Registrar of the relevant Magistrates Court.

I agree.
