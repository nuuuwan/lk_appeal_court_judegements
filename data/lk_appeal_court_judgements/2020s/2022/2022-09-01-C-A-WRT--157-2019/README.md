The Petitioner to this writ application is a holder of a liquor license in the type of FL/11

(marked as P3) issued by the Commissioner General of Excise, the 1st Respondent. The

Petitioner bought another two liquor licenses marked as P4 and P5 from one

Rajamanthri Gedara Premaratne and carried out his business of selling liquor at the

"Excellent Restaurant" situated at No. 128 Bobabila, Makuldeniya (hereinafter referred

to as the Premises) since 2007 until 2015. Due to financial difficulties of the Petitioner

and the person from whom the Petitioner leased the Premises had a dispute over the

Premises and had a case pending in the District Court, the Petitioner could not carry-

out his business till 2018. Therefore, he neither ran the business, nor renewed the license

up till 2018. In 2018 after a lapse of 3 years, the Petitioner applied to renew his liquor

license and by the letter dated 15.10.2018 marked P8C, the 1st Respondent directed the

3

Divisional Secretary, Meda-Dumbara, the 3rd Respondent to issue licenses to the

Petitioner for the year 2018 after recovering the license fee and default fee for the period

of 2016 -2018. Nevertheless, the 3rd Respondent informed the Petitioner by letter dated

14.11.2018 marked as P9b that he received written objections from the public against

the reopening of the liquor shop and sought further instructions from the 1st Respondent

about the issuance of a license. By the letter dated 12.11.2018 marked as P10, the 3rd

Respondent informed the 1st Respondent about the public protest of the clergy, Civil

Societies and the general public for reopening the liquor shop and sought advice of the

1st Respondent regarding the matter. Thereafter, the Deputy Commissioner General of

Excise (Revenue), the 2nd Respondent informed the Assistant Commissioner of Excise,

Central Province by letter dated 20.11.2018 marked as P11-a to conduct an inquiry

trough a committee consisting the 3rd Respondent and Superintendent of Excise

(Kandy) regarding the public protest. Accordingly, as per letter dated 07.12.2018 of the

3rd Respondent, an inquiry was held on18.12.2018 by a committee consisted of

Assistant Commissioner of Excise (Central Province), the 3rd Respondent and the

Commissioner of Excise (Kandy). By letter dated 23.01.2019 marked as 1R5 the

committee recommended the 2nd Respondent not to issue the liquor license due to the

public protest. In this application, the Petitioner seek reliefs, inter alia, a writ of

Certiorari to quash the letter marked as P10 issued by the 3rd Respondent, writs of

Mandamus directing the 1st to 3rd Respondents to renew the liquor license of the

Petitioner for the years 2018 and 2019 and a writ of Mandamus directing the 3rd

Respondent to take administrative steps to comply with the decisions contained in

letters marked as P8-c and P8d.

The document marked as P10 is a letter issued by the 3rd Respondent seeking

instructions from the 1st Respondent about issuance of license to the Petitioner. P10

does not contain a decision. It is trite law that a writ of Certiorari could be issued only

to quash a decision of a public authority. Therefore, since the document marked as P10

4

does not contain a decision, the Petitioner is not entitled to a writ of Certiorari to quash

that letter as prayed for in prayer d to the Petition.

In order to be entitled to a writ of Mandamus, the Petitioner must have a legal right for

it and the public authority must owe a public duty towards the Petitioner to perform that

duty. In the instant application, it is conceded that until 2015 the Petitioner continued

selling liquor on a license issued by the 1st Respondent. Thereafter, for 3 years until

2018 he did not carry-on the business and his license was suspended for the reason that

he has not applied for renewal. The learned Sate Counsel appearing for the Respondents

submitted to Court that a party who has a license is not entitled to automatic renewal of

it and if he does not observe the conditions stipulated in the license, the 1st Respondent

could refuse to extend the license. Schedule III of the Extraordinary Gazette No:

1544/17 dated 10th April 2008 marked as P1 states as follows;

1. (a) The present holders of license will not be entitled to automatic renewal thereof,

on termination of the validity of a license, if the licensee, so desires to renew his license,

an application should be forwarded at least fifteen (15) days prior to the expiry of such

license.

In view of the aforementioned rule, the Petitioner in the instant application does not

have an absolute right for automatic renewal of his license after its validity expired in

2015. Ultimately, he is not entitled to a writ of Mandamus as he does not have a legal

right for automatic renewal of the license and the 3rd Respondent does not owe a public

duty towards the Petitioner to renew the liquor license automatically.

Nonetheless, in terms of Rule 13 (b) in P1, the applicant for a liquor license must prove

that he is able to conduct the business within the specified premises.

13. (b) Proof of right to carry on business at the identified premises by submitting

either the original deeds as proof of ownership along with a certified copy of the same

which shall be retained in the file maintained for the purpose, or if the premises are

not owned by the applicant, a document expressing the consent of the owner of the

5

premises that the proposed business can be carried out undisturbed in the identified

premises. Such document should be appropriately certified by a Notary Public. If the

proposed premises is mortgaged a letter should be submitted by the relevant financial

institution confirming that the property is under mortgage.

Accordingly, the Petitioner to the instant application should submit a document

expressing the consent of the owner of the premises for running the business. In the

instant application, there had been a dispute over the property between the owner and

another person and the owner had issued an affidavit dated 04.10.2016 marked as 1R3

objecting for issuance of license to the Petitioner to run the business of selling liquor in

the premises. The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner has argued that, that

objection was not there when the inquiry was held on 18.08.2018 regarding the

application of the Petitioner for renewal of the license. Nevertheless, there is no proof

into that effect and as per the proceedings of the District Court action marked as P14,

the Court can draw the attention to the fact that the District Court case had been

withdrawn on 13.08.2019 i.e. after the inquiry was held on 18.08.2018. Under the above

stated circumstances, the Petitioner has failed to fulfill the requirement of the Rule

13(b) to be entitled to renewal of the liquor license.

According to Rule 13 (f) in P1, the Director General of Excise has powers to call reports

from the Divisional Secretary to ascertain the facts, whether the person who applied for

a license is a fit person to hold a license issued under Exercise Ordinance and there is

any objection of the public to issuance of license. Similarly, as provided by the Rule

21, at an inquiry, if it is revealed that the continuation of a disputed liquor license is a

threat or likely threat to the maintenance of law and order in the area, Commissioner

General of Excise can decide to relocate the license premises to a suitable place. Rule

21 provides thus;

21. Any objection or protest received by the Commissioner General of Excise from a

member of organization of the public either before or after the issue of a license, on the

6

ground that there has been a violation or noncompliance with any requirement of the

Excise Ordinance or the Guidelines and Conditions herein contained in regard to the

issue or continuance of a license, will be notified by the Commissioner General of

Excise to the applicant or the licensee as the case may be and will thereafter be inquired

into by the Commissioner General of Excise as to the validity thereof and action taken

after such inquiry on the basis of the findings thereat. In such an inquiry, if it is found

that the establishment continuing the license at that place may threat or likely threat

to the maintenance of law and order in the area, Commissioner General of Excise can

decide to relocate the license premises to a suitable place. This decision will be final.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the public protest towards the

Restaurant occurred due to political influence and that the letters and the affidavits said

to have been issued by the public were issued prior to the application for renewal of

license in 2018 and to the date of the application for renewal of license, there had been

no objection. However, when perusing the letters and the affidavits of the public

tendered to the Court along with 1R5 on behalf of the Respondents, it is clear that there

had been several protests against the reopening of the liquor shop. In the document

marked as 1R2 dated 05.07.2016 it is stated by the 3rd Respondent that the Assistant

Superintendent of Police of the area had informed that the clergy and the public had

staged a protest on 24.06.2016 against the issuance of liquor license to the premises

which the Petitioner sold liquor. The inquiry regarding the application of the Petitioner

for the renewal of license has been conducted on 18.12.2018 and it transpires from the

letters annexed to 1R5 received by the 3rd Respondent that there had been a public

protest even in 2018 for license being issued to the Petitioner. Some of those letters

were issued by the Officer-In-Charge of the area dated 12.02.2018, by Civil Societies

dated 07.10.2018 and 09.11.2018, by the Chief Priest of Sri Wardhanarama Maha

Viharaya dated 08.11.2018, 17.12.2018 and from villagers dated 24.11.2018. A letter

7

dated 12.02.2018 issued by the Officer-In-Charge of Teldeniya Police Station states as

follows;

Under the above stated circumstances, it is evident that there had been a public protest

against the reopening of the liquor shop even in the year 2018. Therefore, the Court

cannot accept the submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that there was no

public protest in 2018.

Rule 20 (c) of P1 states as follows;

20. (c) The location of premises for operation of licenses in respect of sale of liquor

off the premises should be 100 meters away (as the crow flies from boundary to

boundary) from Schools and places of public religious worship and in respect of

licenses for selling liquor for consumption within the premises should be 500 meters

away (as the crow flies from boundary to boundary) from schools and places of public

religious worship.

According to the site inspection report prepared by the 3rd Respondent marked as 1R2,

a registered private Montessori School at the Pradeshiya Sabha is situated within 15

meters from the place where the Petitioner is intending to carry-on the liquor shop.

To invoke the judicial review, the Petitioner should establish that the decision of the

Respondents not to renew the license is tainted with unreasonableness, illegality,

irrationality or any procedural impropriety. Under the above stated circumstances, the

Petitioner has failed to satisfy Court any of those facts. Admittedly, the Petitioner has

taken part in the inquiry regarding his application for renewal of license and there is no

8

allegation that the rules of natural justice have not been observed. The Petitioner has

failed to comply with the rules issued under the Excise Ordinance. Under the above

stated circumstances, the Petitioner is not entitled to the writs as sought in the Petition

dated 05.04.2019. The application for writs is dismissed. The Petitioner should pay Rs.

25,000/= to each Respondent as costs of this application.

Application dismissed with costs.
