R. Gurusinghe, J.

The accused-appellant (the appellant) was indicted in the High Court of

Hambantota for committing the robbery of Rupees Forty One Thousand Five

Hundred, belonging to R.M. Gunadasa along with the others who are unknown

to the prosecution, on or about the 21st of August 2000, an offence punishable

under section 380 of the Penal Code and for the possession of a firearm at the

time of committing the robbery, an offence punishable under section 383 of the

Penal Code.

After the trial, the appellant was found guilty to the charge and sentenced to

seven years imprisonment with a fine of a sum of Rupees Two Thousand Five

Hundred, with a default sentence of two months, and in addition, ordered to

pay a sum of Rupees Fifty Thousand to PW1 with a default term.

The principal argument for the appellant in this Court is that the identity of the

appellant was not proved beyond reasonable doubt and it is unsafe to allow the

conviction to stand. Some other grounds were also urged.

The prosecution has called PW1 and PW3 as eye witnesses together with the

police witnesses. Notes of the identification parade was marked as P1. PW1

stated that four people came into the house covering their faces with black

cloths and as a result he was unable to identify any of them. He further stated

that he could not identify anyone at the identification parade. They had taken a

sum of rupees ten thousand and jewellery worth about fifty thousand by force.

PW3 is the only witness who said that she was able to see the face of the

appellant, when the appellant made her open a drawer and took the money and

jewellery using a small torch. PW3 has admitted that the appellant was not a

known person before the incident. On one occasion, she said that the person

she had identified at the identification parade was not in the court house.

A contradiction was marked as V1 during the cross-examination. On page 76

and 77 of the brief, PW3 answered as follows:

This is a vital contradiction with regard to the identity of the robbers. The

evidence of her (PW3) father, PW1 clearly stated that all the persons who

entered his house were covering their faces with black cloths, and he was not

able to identify them. The position of PW3 was that the persons who entered

the house had applied some black substance on their faces to conceal their

identity. There were a large number of omissions in her testimony, including a

vital omission. She had not mentioned in her statement to the police that she

was able to see the face of any persons or she had seen the features of the

appellant's face, which enabled her to recognize him later. As per the evidence

of PW1, four persons entered the house. If she could identify or recognize any

of them, then that is a vital piece of information, and she should have

mentioned it to the police.

The appellant's position is that he was shown to the witnesses at the police

station with a particular reference to a mark on his face. When this position

was put to PW3, she said that only her father PW1 had gone to the police

station to see the suspect. This shows that the appellant was shown to the

witnesses at the police station. In the notes of the identification parade, the

counsel for the appellant stated as follows:

The Judge who wrote the judgment had heard only the dock statement of the

appellant. None of the witnesses for the prosecution were led before him.

Therefore, the Learned High Court Judge who wrote the judgment had no

opportunity to see the witnesses and therefore, deportment and demeanor of

witnesses are of no importance in this case.

PW3 has stated to the police that as the robbers were covering their faces with

black cloths, she was not able to identify any of them. However, her position in

the evidence in Court is that one of the persons who came to her house was the

appellant. When she was asked to open a drawer and take the money, she

identified the appellant. When she was questioned whether she had mentioned

to the police that the robbers were covering their faces with black cloths, she

denied it. That portion of her statement was marked as V1. This is a very vital

contradiction that goes to the root of the case and diminishes the credibility of

PW3. PW3 had changed her position regarding the identities of the robbers

completely. PW3 has not mentioned anything that would be helpful to identify

the robbers in her statement to the police.

Furthermore, in her statement to the police, PW3 has mentioned that she could

not identify any of the persons who entered the house. The defense has drawn

the attention of the Trial Judge to this fact. These omissions are vital regarding

the identity of the persons who entered their house. The evidence of PW1 is

that all the robbers came to their home, covering their faces with black cloths.

The position of PW3 in this regard changed. She and her father both stated to

6

the police that all the robbers were covering their faces with black cloths and

they were not able to identify any of them

The appellant's position is that he was shown to the witnesses in the police

station before the identification parade was held. As there was a unique mark

on the appellant's face, police have asked the witnesses also to take note of

that mark. At the identification parade, the counsel for the appellant recorded

this position before the Learned Magistrate who held the identification parade.

This was duly recorded.

When considering the issue of the identity of the appellant, only PW3 stated

that she identified the appellant. However, as pointed out above, the evidence

of PW3 regarding the identity of the appellant is not reliable when compared

with her own statement to the police and the evidence of PW1. It is clear that

none of them could identify any of the robbers.

When PW3 was questioned as to whether she had gone to the police station

after the arrest of the appellant, her position was that only her father PW1 had

gone to the police station. It is possible that PW3 had gone to the police station

with his father and the appellant was shown to PW3, and from the mark on the

appellant's face, PW3 had identified him at the identification parade.

In King Vs. Tholis Silva (1937) 39 NLR 267, Hearne J., in regard to questions on

identification, stated that 'It is improper to allow witnesses the opportunity of

seeing beforehand persons whom they will later be ordered to identify in an

identification parade.

The evidence of PW3 regarding the identity of the appellant is not reliable,

considering the vital contradictions and omissions regarding the identity of the

persons who came to their house. The police could not recover any article from

the appellant's possession.

The evidence is insufficient to support the appellant's conviction in the

circumstances. I, therefore, set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed

on the appellant.

The appellant is acquitted

The appeal is allowed.
