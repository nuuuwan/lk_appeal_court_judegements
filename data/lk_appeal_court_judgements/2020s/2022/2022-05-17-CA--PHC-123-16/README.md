This is an appeal filed on 03.11.2016 by a corporate body named Ingiriya Multi-

purpose Co-operative Society (hereinafter the petitioner) impugning the order of

the High Court of Panadura in Case No HCRA/01/2016 dated 19.10.2016. The

impugned order upheld a preliminary objection raised by the respondents,

CA-PHC-123/16 Page 4 of 12 17/05/2022 IJ-21-22

thereby dismissing the revision application filed by the petitioner before High

Court.

The instant appeal centers around a case filed by the Special Criminal

Investigation Unit of Panadura in Case No 23420, involving the petitioners

employees in the delivery of a consignment of flour and allegations of criminal

breach of trust, cheating, forgery and offence under Public Property Act. In the

said case, the Magistrate Court delivered its order dated 18.02.20013, thereby

acquitting the accused. Aggrieved by the said acquittal, the petitioner filed a

revision application to the High Court on 26.07.2013. the respondent raised

several preliminary objections as to the applications maintainability during the

support stage, and the High Court decided to deal with the said objections prior

to issuing notices to the respondents. The learned High Court judge delivering

the impugned order dismissed the application of the petitioner without issuing

notices to the respondent. Impugning the said order dated 19.10.2016, the

petitioner filed the instant appeal before this Court on 03.11.2016.

At the outset, it is to be highlighted that this appeal pivots on the issue of

whether the learned High Court Judge, having dismissed the application of the

petitioner without inferring on the merits of the case, has erred in law. And if so,

whether that error amounts to succeed this instant appeal

The impugned order refers to D. S. Jayawardana & another v V. L.

Karunaratne & others (PHC) 38/2012 CA Minute dated 07.03.2014 and

Marimuththu v Sivapakkiyam 1986 1 CALR 264 to hold the following at Page

44 of the Brief (Page 3 of the order):

it is evident from the above Judicial Authorities that the petitioner should explain

why he did not prefer an appeal. In the instant revision application, nothing is

mentioned why the petitioner did not file an appeal. Hence, the instant revision

application could not be maintained

CA-PHC-123/16 Page 5 of 12 17/05/2022 IJ-21-22

When considering the D. S. Jayawardana judgment (supra), the application

involved an instance where the petition suffered an incurable defect (the petition

was patently defective as it did not comply with Rule 3 of the Supreme Court,

that there was no proper jurat) which was based as a ground for dismissal before

the High Court. Against such dismissal the petitioner came before the Court of

Appeal, and the Court of Appeal upheld the dismissal. Therefore, the application

of D. S. Jayawardana (supra) depends on its facts. His Lordship Justice Salam

delivering the judgment held the following: I am not inclined to accept this

position of the respondent as the dismissal of the revision application by the

learned High Court Judge in the first instance due to the defect in the affidavit

referred to above, was no obstacle in the way of the petitioners to have filed a

subsequent revision application, if they were so interested, to challenge the

impugned order/determination of the learned Magistrate. Therefore, even if the

learned High Court Judge has not given an opportunity to the petitioners to cure

the defect in the affidavit, yet they were not prejudiced by the refusal to issue

notice on the revision application as they could have very well filed, a subsequent

application. In any event, the petitioners have failed to aver in the revision

application filed in this Court, as to why they did not prefer an appeal against the

judgment of the learned High Court Judge. Further, they have not pleaded any

exceptional circumstances acceptable to this Court against the impugned judgment

of the learned High Court Judge to invoke the extraordinary revisionary jurisdiction

of this Court. Hence, D. S. Jayawardana (supra) involved a case where there was

a patent violation of Supreme Court Rules which formed the basis for the revision

application to be dismissed in limine. The reference to petitioners failure to aver

reasons for not filing an appeal is only an ancillary matter. D. S. Jayawardana

(supra) deemed that no prejudice was caused for the petitioner by the High

Courts judges determination that the defect was incurable thus concluding that

there is no exceptionality warranting the invocation of the revisionary

jurisdiction. While D. S. Jayawardana (supra) refers to the right of appeal in the

context of maintainability of a revision application, it cannot be used as an

CA-PHC-123/16 Page 6 of 12 17/05/2022 IJ-21-22

authority for the contention that failure to exercise right of appeal, disentitles a

petitioner from invoking the revisionary jurisdiction.

While the impugned order has referred Marimuththu (supra), it was delivered in

1986 and a series of authorities have emerged since then to support the

contention that the revisionary jurisdiction can be invoked even when an

alternate remedy exists and that the integral determinant for an application in

revision is the existence of exceptional circumstances. In Dharmaratne and

another v Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd (2003) 3 SLR 24 the existence of

exceptional circumstances is the process by which the court select s the cases of

which the extraordinary method of rectification should be adopted. If such a

selection process is not there, revisionary jurisdiction of this court will become a

gateway of every litigant to make a second appeal in the garb of a Revision

application or to make an appeal in situations where the legislature has not given

a right of appeal As held by the Supreme Court in Union Culling Knit

Garments (PVT) LTD and Others v Habib Bank Ltd (2004) 3 SLR 128, revision

no doubt is an extra ordinary remedy and has to be exercised only in exceptional

circumstances. What such exceptional circumstances are, would have to be

decided by the appellate court in exercising its powers of revision, on the facts and

circumstances of each case. It has been held by successive judgments that a

petitioner who has failed to exhaust alternate remedies is not barred from relying

on the said jurisdiction unless such petitioner fails to establish exceptional

circumstances. Rustom v Hapangama (CA) (1978 -79) 2 SLR 225 held that the

trend of authority clearly indicates that where the revisionary powers of the Court

of Appeal are invoked the practice has been that these powers will be exercised if

there is an alternative remedy available only if the existence of special

circumstances are urged necessitating the indulgence of this court to exercise these

powers in revision. If the existence of special circumstances does not exist, then

this court will not exercise its powers in revision. In Rasheed Ali v Mohammed

Ali and Others (1981) 1 SLR 262 it was held the powers of revision vested in

the Court of Appeal are very wide and the Court can in a fit case exercise that

CA-PHC-123/16 Page 7 of 12 17/05/2022 IJ-21-22

power whether or not an appeal lies. Where the law does not give a right of appeal

and makes the order final, the Court of Appeal may nevertheless exercise its

powers of revision, but it should do so only in exceptional circumstances.

Ordinarily the Court will, not interfere by way of review, particularly when the law

has expressly given an aggrieved party an alternate remedy such as the right to

file a separate action except when non-interference will cause a denial of justice

or irremediable harm. In Thilagaratnam v Edirisinghe (1982) 1 SLR 56 it was

held that though the appellate courts powers to act in revision were wide and

would be exercised whether an appeal has been taken against the order of the

original court or not, such powers would be exercised only in exceptional

circumstances.

Therefore, it is clear that the integral component for an application under the

revisionary jurisdiction is the existence of exceptional circumstances.

Exhaustion of alternate remedies or rendering an explanation to the failure of

resorting to such alternate remedy, is not a necessary precondition for the

invocation of the revisionary jurisdiction in each and every case. It would

certainly not be a defect amounting to the dismissal of an application in limine

at the support stage.

In any event, the petitioner has averred reasons as to why an appeal has not

been lodged prior to the invocation of the revisionary jurisdiction. Petitioner has

submitted that they were not a party to the Magistrate Court case which initiated

proceedings concerned. It is the contention of the petitioner that as such, Section

320(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No.15 of 1979 (hereinafter the CPC)

envisaging the right of appeal is limited to party to any criminal charge and that

as the petitioner was not a party to the Magistrate Court proceedings, he could

not exercise the statutory right of appeal. In recognition of the said submission,

the following is observed by the impugned order: in tendering written

submission on behalf of the petitioner, it is stated that an appeal cannot be filed

by a private party because it gets delayed in obtaining sanction of the Attorney

CA-PHC-123/16 Page 8 of 12 17/05/2022 IJ-21-22

General. It is further stated that there is no prohibition to file a revision

application in an occasion where an appeal could be preferred. It is correct there

is no such prohibition. However, there are limitations on filing revision

application when the right of appeal is there (Page 44 of the Brief page 3 of the

order). The impugned order refers to the application of Section 318 of the CPC

in the instant matter to hold the following at Page 47 of the Brief:

Section 318 is amply clear. The section says that an appeal could not be filed

against an acquittal by a Magistrate Court, except at the instance or with the

written sanction of the Attorney General. In other words, an acquittal by a

Magistrate could not be challenged without the sanction of the Attorney General.

Hence, it is apparent when the Attorney General did not grant sanction to appeal

against the Judgment of the instant action, the petitioner cannot come to this court

by way of revision and ask to set aside the judgment of acquittal without the

sanction of the Attorney General. Therefore, this revision application could not be

proceeded (emphasis added)

On the said point, there are instances where revision applications against

acquittals by Magistrates were entertained even in the absence of sanction of the

Attorney General. Nandanakumarage Sunil Karunarathne v Padmakumara

Wickramasinghe & Others CA/PHC/52/13 CA Minute dated 29.05.2017

delivered by His Lordship Justice L. T. B. Dehideniya involved a case where an

aggrieved party impugned an acquittal of the Magistrate. In the said case, the

petitioners contention was that he made an application through the legal aid to

the Hon. Attorney General to appeal against the order, but the AG replied only

after 10 months indicating that the AG is not appealing against and informing

the Appellant to consider a revision. In the said judgment, Section 320 of the

CPC is considered, and the following is observed: After 28 days, even the AG is

debarred from filing an appeal. Therefore, there is no reason for the appellant to

wait for 10 months to get a reply. He is ought to know that the appealable time

has lapsed. Everybody is presumed know the law and the ignorance of law is not

CA-PHC-123/16 Page 9 of 12 17/05/2022 IJ-21-22

an excuse. Once the appealable period is over, the appellant should have

considered a revision, without waiting for the AG to give a direction to consider a

revision. The delay cannot be considered as reasonable. Revision being a

discretionary remedy, the one who is seeking the assistance of Court must act

promptly and one who is sleeping over his grievances cannot seek the assistance

of Court by way of revision to remedy the injustice complained of Inordinate delay

is fatal to a revision application. (at page 4)

Hence, it is clear that the invocation of the revisionary jurisdiction by an

aggrieved party against an order of acquittal by a Magistrate is independent to

the existence of sanction of the Attorney General. This is in line with the

judgment in Mariam Beebee v Seyed Mohamed (1965) 68 NLR 36 where it was

held that the power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite

independent of and distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of this court. Its object

is the due administration of justice and the correction of errors, sometimes

committed by this court itself, in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice and the

correction of errors, sometimes committed by this Court itself, in order to avoid

miscarriage of justice. It is exercised in some cases by a Judge of his own motion,

when an aggrieved person who may not be a party to the action brings to his notice

that fact that, unless the power is exercised, injustice will result. The law does

not envisage a duty on an aggrieved party to request sanction of the Attorney

General although he may well do so if he pleases. The contention of the learned

High Court Judge in the impugned order that In other words, an acquittal by a

Magistrate could not be challenged without the sanction of the Attorney General

necessarily ousts the revisionary jurisdiction vested with the Court of Appeal

under the Constitution and cannot be accepted. As expounded earlier, the

primary requirement for the invocation of the revisionary jurisdiction is the

existence of exceptional circumstances. Recently, Her Ladyship Justice Murudu

N.B. Fernando P.C. held in SC Appeal 210/2015 SC minute dated 18.12.2020

that . the revisionary jurisdiction of a court can be exercised only when there

are exceptional grounds that shocks the conscience of court or which merits the

CA-PHC-123/16 Page 10 of 12 17/05/2022 IJ-21-22

intervention of the appellate court. .. Hence, the underlying requirement

in a revisionary jurisdiction is exceptional grounds and circumstances.

The impugned order at Page 46 of the Brief (page 5 of the order) the learned High

Court Judge makes the following determination: in the petition filed by the

petitioner, not only the special circumstances have not been pleaded, but also no

special circumstances is mentioned in the petitioner. therefore, on that ground

alone, this revision application has to be dismissed

Page 45 of the Appeal brief (Page 4 of the order) in the instant application, it is

apparent that no special circumstances have been pleaded. In perusing the

evidence of the case and the finding of the learned Magistrate, it is apparent that

there is no such miscarriage of justice occurred

The petition filed before the High Court avers exceptional circumstances vide

Therefore, the contention within the impugned order that no exceptional

circumstances have been averred is erroneous. When the matter is at the

support stage, the court is not required to assess in depth, whether the

purported exceptional circumstances do in fact amount to an exceptionality of a

nature that warrants the invocation of the revisionary jurisdiction, unless they

are apparently baseless, unfounded or unsubstantiated. That matter must be

decided on the merits of the case. In the instant matter, the petitioner has not

patently omitted to aver exceptional circumstances. Paragraph 28 sets out the

exceptional circumstances averred by the petitioner in the petition. Nevertheless,

the impugned order states that there are exceptional circumstances are not

apparent. However, the learned High Court Judge does not refer to the averments

of Paragraph 28 of the petition, nor a determination has been made or reasons

given whether they are in fact exceptional circumstances warranting the

invocation of the revisionary jurisdiction or mere substantial questions of law

outside the revisionary ambit (see Elangakoon v Officer in Charge, Police

CA-PHC-123/16 Page 12 of 12 17/05/2022 IJ-21-22

Station, Eppawala (2007) 1 SLR 398). The impugned order merely says that

exceptional circumstances are not apparent.

Based on the above exposition, it is clear that the impugned order has erred on

several issues in holding that the petitioners failure to file an appeal/ give reason

disentitles him from maintaining the application, an acquittal by a Magistrate

cannot be challenged - even in way of revision, without the sanction of the

Attorney General and that the petitioner has failed to aver exceptional

circumstances in the petition.

Therefore, this Court sets aside the order dated 19.10.2016

It is the considered view of this Court that the case be sent back to the High

Court to be considered on the merits of the case after issuing formal notices on

respondents.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.
