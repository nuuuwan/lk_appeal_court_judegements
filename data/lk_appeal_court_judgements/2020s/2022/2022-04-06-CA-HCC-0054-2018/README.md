Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) challenging the conviction and the sentence of him by the learned

High Court Judge of Gampaha.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Gampaha for causing the

death of one Vithanage Siripala, along with some others who are unknown to

the prosecution on 18th February 2007, an offence punishable in terms of

section 296 of the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, the appellant was found guilty as charged by the

learned High Court Judge by his judgment dated 23-03-2018, and was

sentenced to death accordingly.

At the hearing of the appeal, the only ground of appeal urged by the learned

Presidents Counsel on behalf of the appellant was that the items of

circumstantial evidence relied on by the prosecution were highly insufficient to

prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt against the appellant. Therefore, the

conviction of the appellant by the learned High Court Judge was bad in law.

Page 3 of 10

Before considering the ground of appeal urged, I would now forcus my

attention to the facts, as revealed in evidence.

The deceased Vithanage Siripala was a caretaker of a hotel owned by PW-01,

Nandana Kularatne. He has received a call from the PW-02 Pradeep, who was a

driver by profession and a person who used to regularly stay in the hotel in the

night. PW-01 has been informed that the deceased was found fallen with

injuries in the front garden of the hotel. As the hotel used to close for business

by 10.00pm, the deceased was alone at that time. After reaching the hotel on

the information received, he has found the deceased fallen with injuries.

Although he was alive at that time, he could not talk. The deceased has

succumbed to his injuries nine days after the admission to the hospital without

gaining consciousness.

The main witness relied on by the prosecution was PW-02 who first found the

deceased fallen in the garden of the hotel. It was his evidence that he came to

the hotel as usual to stay for the night at about 9.30pm. After having his

meals, he has left for the boutique which was in front of the hotel in order to

have some fruits as it was his usual habit. Returning to the hotel about five

minutes before 10.00pm as it was the closing time of the hotel, the witness has

observed a butter-coloured three-wheeler leaving the hotel gate. As he had

heard a sound like someone being assaulted while in the boutique, the witness

has noted down the number of the vehicle as JN 6514. He has then seen the

deceased fallen in the front garden of the hotel with injuries to his head.

Later, the police have traced the owner of the three-wheeler as Malini Perera

(PW-05). It was her evidence that she rented the vehicle to the appellant for a

200/-per day rent, and it was the appellant who was using the vehicle at the

time of the incident to earn his living. On the day in question the appellant has

taken over the vehicle as usual and had returned in the afternoon. After

informing her that he could not find sufficient income for the day, he has taken

the three-wheeler again, saying that he wants to do some night hires as well.

Page 4 of 10

However, the appellant has failed to return the vehicle that night.

Subsequently, she has been informed by her son (PW-03) that there had been

an issue involving the vehicle when it went on a hire to a hotel. The three-

wheeler has been found by the son parked behind a boutique and had brought

it home, but has seen the appellant only after his arrest few days later. She has

not seen any particular damage to the three-wheeler.

According to the evidence of the son of PW-05 Chaminda Kumara, he has come

to know that the front windscreen has been broken in the three-wheeler

belonging to them via a third party at around 7 or 8 in the night. He was

unable to remember the exact date on which he received the information, but

has found the vehicle abandoned near a coffee shop. On inspection he has

found the front light of the vehicle broken. The appellant to whom the vehicle

was given to be used for hiring purposes was not there to be found. The

witness who has taken the abandoned vehicle home has later surrendered it to

the police. He has got an opportunity to question the appellant only when he

was released on bail after some time. The appellant has informed the witness

that he went on a hire to a hotel and the vehicle got damaged due to a brawl

that took place there.

At the trial, an extract of the statement made by the appellant to the police

when he was arrested ten days after the incident, which led to the discovery of

a stool (the item marked P-03) has been marked as P-02 in terms of section 27

of the Evidence Ordinance. This item is said to have been recovered near the

place where the deceased was found injured. The postmortem report dated 28-

02-2007 by PW-13, the Judicial Medical Officer of Colombo has been admitted

by the parties.

During the investigations as to the crime, seven other persons have also been

arrested and charged along with the appellant. After the conclusion of the non-

summary inquiry before the Magistrate, all others have been discharged due to

lack of evidence.

Consideration of the Ground of Appeal

As there had been no eyewitness to the actual incident where the deceased had

suffered injuries which led to his death, this is a matter that had been decided

based on the circumstantial evidence.

It is therefore necessary to consider the way any available circumstantial

evidence should be looked at by a trial Court in order to conclude whether the

case has been proved beyond reasonable doubt against an accused person.

In the case of The King Vs. Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254 it was held:

Per Soertsz J.

In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the jury must be

satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the accused

and inconsistent with any reasonable hypotheses of his innocence.

In Don Sunny Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 01 it was held:

1) When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the

proved items of circumstantial evidence when taken together must

irresistibly point towards only inference that the accused committed the

offence. On consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can

be arrived at should be consistent with the guilt of the accused only.

2) If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence, if an

inference can be drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the

accused, then one cannot say that the charges have been proved

beyond reasonable doubt.

3) If upon consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence if

the only inference that can be drawn is that the accused committed the

offence, then they can be found guilty. The prosecution must prove that

no one else other than the accused had the opportunity of committing

the offence. The accused can be found guilty only if the proved items of

Page 6 of 10

circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt and inconsistent

with their innocence.

In the case of Regina Vs. Exall (176 English Reports, Nisi Prius at page

853) Pollock, C.B., considering the aspect of circumstantial evidence remarked;

It has been said that circumstantial evidence is to be considered as a

chain, and each piece of evidence as a link in a chain, but that is not so,

for then, if any one link brock, the chain would fall. It is more like the of a

rope composed of several cords. One strand of the rope might be

insufficient to sustain the weight, but three stranded together may be quite

of sufficient strength.

However, in considering the circumstantial evidence, what has to be considered

is the totality of the circumstantial evidence before coming to a firm finding as

to the guilt of an accused, although each piece of circumstantial evidence when

taken separately may only be suspicious in nature.

In the case of The King Vs. Gunaratne 47 NLR 145 it was held:

In a case of circumstantial evidence, the facts given in evidence may,

taken cumulatively, be sufficient to rebut the presumption of innocence,

although each fact, when taken separately, may be a circumstance only of

suspicion.The jury is entitled to draw inferences unfavourable to an

accused where he is not called to establish an innocent explanation of

evidence given by the prosecution, which, without such explanation, tells

for his guilt.

When it comes to the facts in the case under consideration, there cannot be

any argument that the deceased has died as a result of the injuries he suffered

due to an assault occurred just before Pradeep (PW-02) found him fallen in

front of the hotel where he worked. The evidence of Pradeep has clearly

established that it was the three-wheeler JM-6514 that left the hotel at that

time. As Pradeep has heard some commotion from the direction where the

Page 7 of 10

deceased was found fallen just before he saw the three-wheeler leaving the

hotel compound, it can be assumed that it was someone who came in the

three-wheeler who caused the injuries to the deceased. However, PW-02

Pradeep has not identified anybody who was inside the three-wheeler or even

whether there were persons inside the vehicle or who was driving the vehicle at

that time.

It can be safely assumed that it may be the appellant who was driving the

vehicle because of the evidence of PW-05 who was the owner of the vehicle and

that of PW-03 the son of the owner, who found the vehicle left abandoned

behind a boutique.

I find that in this context, what the appellant has told PW-03 the son of the

owner when asked by him as to what happened should also be relevant. He has

told him that the vehicle got damaged as a result of an issue when he went on

a hire to the hotel. Other than that, he has not divulged any other detail as to

what happened. The evidence of PW-03 also confirms the fact that the

appellant wanted to take the vehicle for hire on that evening because he could

not earn enough money during the day.

In my view, the above facts, taken cumulatively, are strongly suggestive of the

fact that the appellant may have gone to the hotel where the incident took

place taking some passengers, as for his usual livelihood.

Under the circumstances, it cannot be said that the available circumstantial

evidence only points to the irresistible conclusion that it was the appellant who

has committed the crime, as there may be some others who were involved in

the brawl which caused injuries to the deceased. I find that the learned High

Court Judge was factually wrong when he determined that the only inference

that can be reached is that it was the appellant who has caused the injuries to

the deceased, given the fact that there were seven others who were charged

before the Magistrate.

Page 8 of 10

Although the production marked P-03 has apparently been recovered based on

the section 27 statement of the appellant, that is not definitive proof of the fact

that it was the appellant who committed the crime, as it only shows the that

the appellant had the knowledge as to the productions whereabout. The fact of

discovery must be supported by other supporting evidence in order to prove a

charge against an accused.

In the Indian case of Pulukuri Kottaya Vs. Emperor A.I.R. (1947) P.C. 67 at

90 it was stated:

The section seems to be based on the view that if a fact is actually

discovered in consequence of information given, some guarantee is

afforded thereby that the information was true. Accordingly, it can be

safely allowed to be given in evidence, but clearly the extent of information

admissible must depend on the exact nature of the fact discovered to

which such information is required to relate.

When it comes to the evidence relating to the recovery of the production

marked P-03, the said stool was said have been recovered by PW-08, police

inspector Chandrageeva at the place of the incident, which was in front of the

hotel mentioned upon the statement made by the appellant. He has observed

blood like stains in the stool as well. The said statement has been recorded ten

days after the incident upon the arrest of the appellant.

In this context, I find it interesting to observe that it was the PW-09, sub

inspector of police Wijetunga who has conducted the investigations into the

incident and had inspected the place of the incident soon after the first

information was received in the morning of the day following the incident. He

has observed blood like stains on the ground in front of the hotel office and

some pieces of glasses on the ground as well.

Page 9 of 10

If the stool recovered by the PW-08 based on the statement made by appellant

ten days after the incident at the place of the incident was there, and if it had

blood like stains as well, I find it rather strange as to why the PW-09, who was

the officer who went there soon after the incident and conducted his

investigations failed to see the same and take it into his custody as a

production relevant to the incident.

In view of the above, I find that the evidence as to the recovery of a stool based

on the statement of the appellant was a piece of evidence clouded with doubt,

which should not have been relied on by the learned High Court Judge as

reliable evidence against the appellant.

The appellants failure to return the vehicle as usual to the owner and

abandoning the vehicle with damages to it are, though highly suspicious

circumstances against the appellant of some involvement, that alone cannot be

a reason to find the appellant guilty as suspicious circumstances alone are not

a reason to come to a finding of guilt against an accused.

In the case of The Queen Vs. M.G.Sumanasena 66 NLR 350, held:

In a criminal case suspicious circumstances do not establish guilt. Nor

does the proof of any number of suspicious circumstances relieve the

prosecution of its burden of proving the case against the accused beyond

reasonable doubt and compel the accused to give evidence.

I am of the view that although suspicions may direct at the appellant, the

considered circumstantial evidence does not go far enough to conclude beyond

reasonable doubt that it was only the appellant who committed the crime and

no one else.

Page 10 of 10

For the reasons adduced, I hold that it is not safe to let the conviction of the

appellant to be allowed to stand. Therefore, allowing the appeal, I set aside the

conviction and the sentence and acquit the appellant from the charge preferred

against him.
