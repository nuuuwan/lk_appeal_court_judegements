Argued on: 21.11.2022

Decided on: 14.12.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to obtain bail to the suspect namely

Manjula Nishantha under the provisions of the Assistance to and

Protection of Victims of crime and Witnesses act.

The facts pertaining to this matter is that facts have been reported to the

Magistrate on 4.7.2021 that the suspect above named had cut and injured

one Vasantha Kumara.

Subsequently another B report had been filed to the effect on 27. 8.2021

that the above named suspect had threatened the witness pertaining to the

stabbing incident and some police officers, under the provisions of the

instant act. The magistrate had remanded the suspect.

The main contention of the Counsel for the suspect is that the act of

threatening reported in the B report filed in August is a fabrication to keep

the suspect in remand.

But the Counsel appearing for the respondents vehemently objected to the

application on the basis that the suspect has one pending case and two

other previous convictions and the instant substantive matter had been

committed during the period of the suspended jail term.

The law pertaining to the instant matter is that a suspect produced under

the instant act can be enlarged on bail only upon exceptional conditions

and it has been decided in many cases that the term exceptional differs

from case to case and in deciding Court has to rely on the cases so far

decided as the statute does not define the term exceptional.

In the instant matter the exceptionality urged is the period in remand on a

fabricated complaint.

At this point this Court takes in to account the fact that matters under this

act should be given priority in order to achieve the objective of the act. The

Counsel for the respondents has objected in view of the suspended term

the suspect was serving at the time of the commission of the initial act. But

this Court observes that suspended terms should be considered at the time

of sentencing and not at the time of bail in the same way as urged by the

Page 4 of 4

State on numerous occasions before this Court that facts of a case should

not be gone into at the time of considering a bail application.

Hence as the suspect has been in remand for a period of over one year

without any administration of justice taking place against or for him we are

of the view that justice can be done only by enlarging the above named

suspect on bail.

As such we direct the Magistrate to enlarge the above named suspect on

suitable conditions of bail on receipt of this order.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

I agree.
