Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The 1st Petitioner has filed this application on behalf of his son who is the 2nd Petitioner.

The Petitioners seek inter alia for a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari to quash

the decision of the 1st to 3rd Respondents to not admit the 2nd Petitioner to Grade 1 of the

Royal College, Colombo 7, for the year 2021.

The admission of students to Grade 1 of Government Schools including the said Royal

College for the year 2021 is governed by the Circular No. 29/2019 dated 24.05.2019 which

has been amended by Circular No. 29/2019 (i) (dated 11.07.2019) and Circular No.

16/2020 (dated 26.05.2020), issued by the Ministry of Education. Those three Circulars

Page 3 of 10

are annexed to the Petition, marked as, P2, P3, and P4 respectively. The instructions

related to such admission of children for the year 2021 issued by the Ministry of Education

are marked as P5.

The Petitioners initial claim is that the 2nd Petitioner was not granted 2 marks at the

interview in respect of the Deed of Lease No. 726 which had been submitted to establish

their residence. The Petitioners allege that although they have been residing at the address

mentioned in the above caption since January 2015, the formal Deed of Lease No. 726

was entered into on 09.09.2015. The Petitioners urge that the members of the interview

panel disregarded the validity of the said Deed of Lease No. 726 from 01.01.2015 to

31.12.2015. A reasonable question arises as to whether an applicant who applies for

admission to Grade 1 is privileged to submit a Lease agreement with retrospective effect

to justify the residence in view of the said Circulars. The scheme of the provisions in

relation to the close residence category under the said Circulars, in my view, is that it is

mandatory for such applicant to actually live at the premises at the address provided in the

application during the required period of time. However, the Petitioners have not made

submissions on the above question at the hearing stage although several averments to that

effect contained in the Petition of the Petitioners.

The primary argument raised by the Petitioners at the hearing is based on clauses 6.0(e),

6.1 (III) of the aforesaid Instructions related to admission of children to Grade 1 for the

year 2021 marked P5 and those provisions are similar to clause 7.1.5 of the Circular

marked P2. It is noted that the said P5 is based on the above Circulars P2 and P4.

The said clause 7.1.5 of the Circular marked P2 has been amended by the Circular No.

29/2019 (i) marked P3.

The Petitioners applied for admission under the close proximity category of the said

Circular P2. The Clause 6.1 (III) of P5 (7.2.4 of P2) deals with the proximity to the

school from the residence. In terms of the said Clause, maximum marks shall be awarded

only if the applicants place of residence is proved and if there are no other Government

Schools with primary sections located closer to the place of residence than the School

applied for. Further, it stipulates that in the event of having other Government Schools

with Primary Sections for the admission of the child which are closer to the place of

residence than the School applied for, marks will be deducted at the rate of 5 marks from

the maximum marks for each such closer School.

Page 4 of 10

As per the said Clause, other Government Primary Schools that the child could be

admitted means; whether the Government School concerned has the learning medium

the child has applied for, whether it is a girls or a boys School or mixed School

appropriate for the child and whether it is a Government School which can admit 10% or

more children of the religion to which the child belongs.

The Petitioners assert that the 2nd Petitioner was awarded only 55.8 marks at the interview

under the marking scheme provided in Clause 7.2 of the Circular marked P2. The

Petitioners submit that there are three Government Schools located closer to the

Petitioners residence than Royal College, namely, Isipathana College - Colombo 5,

Thurstan College - Colombo 7 & Vidyathilaka Vidyalaya - Colombo 5 and as such the

Interview Board (Board) could only deduct 15 marks (5 marks each for a school) whereas

the Board has deducted marks for all the following 5 Government Schools;

i. Isipathana College - Colombo 5

ii. Thurstan College - Colombo 7

iii. Vidyathilaka Vidyalaya - Colombo 5

iv. St. Marys Sinhala Mix School - Colombo 4

v. Dudley Senanayake College - Colombo 7

The maximum marks that could be awarded under the said Clause 7.2.4 of P2 (Clause

6.1 (III) of P5) is 50 marks. The Petitioners do not dispute for deducting marks for three

schools namely, Isipathana College, Thurstan College & Vidyathilaka Vidyalaya which

are located closer to the place of residence than the school applied for. However, the

Petitioners purported grievance is that the Board has deducted 5 marks each (10 marks in

total) for the above other two schools namely, St. Marys Sinhala Mix School and Dudley

Senanayake College. The Board has decided marks for those two schools (namely St.

Marys Sinhala Mix School and Dudley Senanayake College) on the basis that those two

schools are also located closer to the Petitioners house than the Royal College.

The crucial question in this application is whether marks could be deducted for the said

Dudley Senanayake College as its location is strongly disputed by the Petitioners. Now, I

advert to the question whether the said Dudley Senanayake College is located closer to the

place of residence than the school applied for by the Petitioner. The Board has taken the

decision to deduct 5 marks each for the above schools based on a 1:15000 scale map and

accordingly, the Board has arrived at a conclusion that the Dudley Senanayake College is

closer to the place of residence of the Petitioners than the Royal College. The Petitioners

Page 5 of 10

complain that the members of the Board did not refer to a 1:50000 scale map which is

stipulated in Clause 7.1.5 of P2 (which has been amended by Circular No. 29/2019 (i)

(P3)). The said Clause 7.1.5 reads;

When considering the proximity from the place of residence, the straight distance

shall be taken and the map on the scale 1:50000 prepared by the Department of the

Surveyor General shall be used for this purpose. The Circle with the radius from

the main door of the applicants house and the main office of the school shall be

drawn and if there are primary schools, where child could be enrolled, within the

said circle marks shall be deducted. When the primary section is located on

separate premises the distance shall be measured from there and not from the

secondary section. However, even if any such school is located within the said

circle, in case of finding it difficult to access the said school from applicants house

due to natural barriers (E.g. rivers, lagoons, marshlands, forests, high ways) marks

shall not be deducted for those schools. (If any doubt arises in deciding this Google

can be used).

The learned State Counsel made submissions justifying the decision of the Board to rely

upon a 1:15000 scale map. The contention of the learned State Counsel is that using the

1:15000 scale map by the Board was not unlawful. In substantiating her argument, the

learned State Counsel further submitted that the Circular P2 does not impose a

mandatory requirement of a 1:50000 scale map as the said Circular permits the use of

Google Maps in the event of a doubt and also that the Board, in terms of Clause 6.2.6 of

P2, has the full authority to consider all factors and to take appropriate decisions. The

said Clause 6.2.6 further stipulates that the duty of clarifying such provisions and the

responsibility to take decisions in respect of selection issues is vested on the Board.

The Respondents state that there is no necessity to obtain special permission to use a

1:15000 scale map and the necessity in terms of the above Clause is only to keep the

Director of Education informed about the same. By virtue of letter dated 09.08.2019,

marked R3, the Principal of Royal College has sought permission from the Ministry of

Education to use the 1:15000 scale map based on the grounds mentioned therein. In the

said letter the Principal explains the difficulty in counting the schools since the Royal

College is situated in a highly populated area in Colombo. The three paragraphs of the

said letter are as below;

.

The duty covering Principal of the Royal College in his affidavit (which was submitted to

this Court) has affirmed that the Ministry of Education subsequently has authorized the

1:15000 scale map for the purposes of interviews. In any event, the Respondents assert

that the Dudley Senanayake College is close to the place of residence of the Petitioner than

Royal College in view of the extracts of the Surveyor Generals map marked R2 and also

according to 1:15000 scale map.

As opposed to the above arguments of the Respondents, the learned Counsel for the

Petitioners contends that in view of 7.1.5 of the Circular P2, it is necessary to consider

the straight distance and the 1:50000 scale map when considering the proximity from the

place of residence. Further, the Petitioners urge that the Board is not authorized to use

1:15000 scale map and no proper approval to use an enlarged map has been tendered to

Court. Therefore, the Petitioners contention is that using an enlarged 1:15000 scale map

at the interview is illegal, ultra vires and contrary to Circulars P2 and P3.

The Petitioners further assert that in terms of the Clause 7.1.5 of Circular P2 as amended

by Circular P3, the Respondents must draw a circle with a radius from the main door of

the Petitioners house and the main office of the school, and only if there are primary

schools where the child could be enrolled, within the said circle, marks shall be deducted

for the said other schools.

When assaying the arguments raised by the learned State Counsel justifying the adoption

of 1:15000 scale map, it is important to examine carefully the provisions of Clause 7.1.5

of the Circular P2 (Clause 6.0(e) of P5). It is no doubt the prescribed map as per in the

said Clause 7.1.5 is the map on the scale 1:50000 prepared by the Department of Surveyor

General. A circle with a radius from the main door of the applicants house and the main

office of the school should be drawn in order to ascertain the number of Government

Schools with primary sections located closer to the place of residence than the school

Page 7 of 10

applied for. Accordingly, in terms of Clause 7.2.4 of P2, if there are any Government

Schools with primary sections for the admission of the child which are closer to the place

of residence than the school applied for, exist within the said circle, marks shall be

deducted at the rate of 5 marks from the maximum marks for each such school.

It is pertinent here to consider whether adopting the 1:15000 scale map at the interview is

illegal, unreasonable or irrational as claimed by the Petitioners. By literal reading of the

provisions of the said Clause 7.1.5, it is observed that the provisions of the said Clause

itself provides a clear instance where the Board could deviate from the requirement of

adopting the map on the scale 1:50000. One such instance which permits deviation is that

if any doubt arises in deciding the distance under the said Clause, it is permitted to use the

Google map and a decision should be taken by comparing the same with the Surveyor

Generals map. The relevant sentence in the said Clause is as follows;

(Google Map)

.

As pointed out by the learned State Counsel in terms of Clause 6.2.6 of P2, it appears

that a considerable discretion has been bestowed on the Board in view of clarifying the

provisions of the Circular and also in taking decisions for admission of children.

In such a backdrop it is important to draw attention to paragraph 33 of the Petition of the

Petitioners in which the Petitioners have categorically averred that when an enlarged

Google map is used for the purpose of assessing the distance, only a part of the Dudley

Senanayake College is within the circle and the other part of the said College is outside

the circle. The Petitioners have annexed a copy of the 1:50000 scale map marked as P15

and an image captured from the official website of Google Maps https://maps.google.lk

marked as P15a. It is in this factual matrix, admitted by the Petitioners, this Court has to

decide what course of action could be taken when a part of the school is situated within

the particular circle and the other part of the school is situated outside the said circle since

the said Clause 7.1.5 does not provide for such a situation.

Anyhow, the said Clause 7.1.5 provides that when the primary section is located in a

separate premises the distance shall be measured from there and not from the secondary

section. Similarly, in case of finding it difficult to access the said school (school which is

within the circle) from applicants house due to natural barriers (e.g. rivers, lagoons,

marshlands, forests, high ways), marks should not be deduced for those schools.

Page 8 of 10

In light of the above, I am of the view that the scheme of the said Clause 7.1.5 is to assess

accurately the fact whether a school upon which marks have been deducted (under Clause

7.2.4) is actually located within the said circle drawn. Thus, the Board should take such

decision without limiting its discretion on a narrow interpretation of any wordings of any

sentence of the said Clause. It is a clear admission by the Petitioners that as per the Google

map, a part of the Dudley Senanayake College is within the respective circle and the other

portion is outside the said circle. Therefore, I take the view that in such a situation, it is

very much appropriate for the Board to ascertain the exact location of such school by

utilizing a lawful additional method.

The learned State Counsel argues that the rationale for using the said enlarged scale map

is to identify the localized area better with more clarity as a 1:15000 scale map would offer

an enlarged picture compared to 1:50000 scale map. A scale map of 1:15000 is a larger

scale map which means that an inch only depicts 15,000 miles on the ground and that is

because the geographic extent shown on a relatively larger scale map is small.

In light of the foregoing, I am inclined to accept the above proposition of the learned State

Counsel subject to certain limitations focused below. It is no doubt that the Board is

compelled to use the 1:50000 scale map for the purpose of considering proximity from the

place of residence. I accept on principle the proposition of the learned Counsel of the

Petitioners that it is imperative that admission of children to grade one of Government

Schools be necessarily decided upon strictly in terms of the Circular marked P2 (which

is the applicable law), and not determined according to any other ground whatsoever.

However, as I have pointed out earlier, I am of the view that the provisions of the Clause

7.1.5 itself provides a deviation and has allowed the comparison of the Google map with

the Surveyor Generals map when a question arises. Accordingly, I observe that there was

an obligation for the Board to resolve the question as to how the proximity from the place

of residence could be assessed in an event the Petitioners claim that only a portion of

Dudley Senanayake College is within the boundary line.

Therefore, I hold that using a 1:15000 scale map in a situation where a portion of the

disputed school is located within the said circle and when the other portion is outside the

circle cannot be considered as unlawful, irrational and unreasonable, provided that the

relevant authorities seek permission from the Ministry of Education in that regard or keep

the said Ministry informed about such action. I am of the view that I should exercise my

discretion to accept the version of the duty covering Principal of the Royal College which

Page 9 of 10

is mentioned in paragraph 19.III of his affidavit, in arriving at my above conclusion. In

the said affidavit the said Principal affirms that the said 1:15000 scale map has been

authorized by the Ministry of Education for purposes of interviews, although the

Respondents have not tendered such letter of authorization to Court. Hence, I take the

view that the deduction of 5 marks for Dudley Senanayake College is not illegal.

Although the Petitioners assert that the finding of the Respondents that the Dudley

Senanayake College is closer than the Royal College to the Petitioners residence is

unsupported by any evidence, the Petitioners have also failed to submit any acceptable

evidence in addition to the documents marked P15, P15(a) and R2 in support of the

contention of the Petitioners. Moreover, the learned State Counsel referring to the cases

of Shahul Majeed Mohamed Rizwan and Another vs. Sampath Weragoda and Others,

SC/FR/Application: 292/2018 (decided on 09.10.2019) and Sarath Hulangamuwa vs.

Siriwardene and others (1981) 1 Sri. L.R. 275 submits that the Petitioners application

ought to be dismissed for want of uberima fides, suppression and misrepresentation based

on the fact that the Petitioners have mentioned only 2 schools in the application form

marked P6 whereas, the paragraph 24 of the Petition divulges 3 Government Schools

located closer to the Petitioners residence than Royal College.

In addition to the above arguments, the Petitioners have averred in their Petition that St.

Marys Sinhala Mixed School (upon which 5 marks have been deducted by the Board)

cannot be treated on equal terms with the Royal College in terms of the applicable

Circulars. The Petitioners submit that St. Marys Sinhala Mixed School is an Assisted

School vested in the Government under the Assisted Schools and Training Colleges

(Special Provisions) Act No. 5 of 1960 at the time of the vesting of the said School in the

Government and it did not have more than 10% Buddhists students. The relevant Clause

in this regard in the Circular P2 is Clause 7.2.4. I have dealt with the provisions of the

said Clause in Wijerathna Arachchige Nethuli Sanulya and other vs. Mrs. Sandya Irani

Pathiranawasam, the Principal Southlands College Galle, CA/Writ/104/2019

(decided on 08.12.2021). The following paragraph of the said case is reiterated here:

A careful examination of clause 7.2.4 of the said circular indicates that there is no

requirement of teaching the subject of Christianity or any other specific subject in the respective

school in order to deduct marks under such provisions of the circular. The framers of the

circular have concentrated only on the fact whether such school admits 10% or more of the

religion to which the child belongs. In other words, the intention of the said clause is to

Page 10 of 10

ascertain whether a respective school has any restriction by law or a by way of a regulation to

admit children.

In the circumstances, I hold that the Petitioners are not entitled to seek for a mandate in

the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions of the Respondents to not admit

the 2nd Petitioner to Grade 1 of Royal College, Colombo. Based on my above conclusion,

I see no reason to consider issuance of a writ of Mandamus as prayed for in the prayer of

the Petition of the Petitioner.

I proceed to dismiss this application. I order no costs.
