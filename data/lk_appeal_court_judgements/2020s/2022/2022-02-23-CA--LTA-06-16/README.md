This is a Leave to Appeal application filed on 26.09.2016 by the Director

General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or

Corruption (hereinafter the Bribery Commission) against the acquittal of

the respondent in Case No B 1392/02 by Order dated 07.09.2016

pronounced by the High Court of Colombo.

The application has come before several benches of this Court since 2016.

However, when the matter was taken up for support on 11.01.2022 the

learned Presidents Counsel for the respondent raised a preliminary

objection contending that the institution of proceedings in Case No B

1392/02 above, is bad in law and accordingly, the Court of Appeal may

not be able to grant the ultimate reliefs claimed in the instant application.

Hence, the order on the said preliminary objection was reserved and both

parties were directed to file written submissions.

The preliminary objection raised is as follows. That the institution of

proceedings in High Court Case no B 139/02 is bad in law as a valid

direction in terms of Section 11 of the Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act No. 19 of 1994 (hereinafter the

CIABOC-Act) has not been given to the Director General of the Bribery

Commission, i.e., all 3 Commissioners have not signed the direction. The

respondent in his written submission refers to the Supreme Court case of

Anoma Polwatte v Jayawickrama Director General, Bribery

Commission and Others SC (writ) 01/2011 SC Minute dated 26.07.2018

in submitting that the direction given by one of the Commissioners in

terms of Section 11 of the said Act to institute criminal proceedings against

an accused is patently illegal.

The counsel for the petitioner, while conceding that the impugned

direction was not signed by all Commissioners, maintained that the same

was legally valid. In the written submissions, the petitioner contends that

LTA-6-16 Page 3 of 6 23/02/2022 IJ-08-22

Anoma Polwatte (supra) was delivered per incuriem submitting that the

preliminary objection raised by the respondent should be dismissed.

As such the instant matter involves a challenge to the validity of the

direction given by the Bribery Commission to institute criminal action

against the respondent. Hence, the respondent, by way of a preliminary

objection is canvassing an act of the Bribery Commission which falls

within the ambit of Section 11 of the CIABOC Act. The said provision

stipulates the institution of criminal proceedings in certain cases:

Where the material received by the Commission in the course of an

investigation conducted by it under this Act, discloses the commission

of an offence by any person under the Bribery Act or the Declaration

of Assets and Liabilities Law, No. 1 of 1975, the Commission shall

direct the Director-General to institute criminal proceedings against

such person in the appropriate court and the Director-General shall

institute proceedings accordingly:

Provided however that where the material received by the

Commission in the course of an investigation conducted by it

discloses an offence under Part II of the Bribery Act and consisting of

soliciting, accepting or offering, by any person, of a gratification

which or the value of which does not exceed two thousand rupees,

the Commission shall direct the institution of proceedings against

such person before the Magistrates Court and where such material

discloses an offence under that Part and consisting of soliciting,

accepting, or offering, by any person of any gratification which or the

value of which exceeds two thousand rupees, the Commission shall

direct the institution of proceedings against such person in the High

Court by indictment.

Therefore, the crux of the preliminary objection raised by the respondent

is impugning an act of the Bribery Commission. Prior to examining the

merit of the said objection, it is pertinent to examine whether the Court of

Appeal has power in appeal to take cognizance of this matter.

LTA-6-16 Page 4 of 6 23/02/2022 IJ-08-22

A careful reading of Section 11 of the CIABOC Act reveals that, in order to

institute criminal action under the Act, a precondition in the form of a

direction by the Bribery Commission is required by law. Any challenge to

such a direction is a challenge to a public duty fulfilled by the Bribery

Commission, arising out of statutory law. The framers of the Commission

Act provide for such a relief in Section 24 of the Commission Act.

Section 24 of the CIABOC Act delineates that the writ jurisdiction in

relation to the Bribery Commission is to be exercised by the Supreme

Court:

(1) The jurisdiction vested in the Court of Appeal by Article 140 of

the Constitution shall, in respect of applications in which relief is

sought against the Commission be exercised by the Supreme

Court and not by the Court of Appeal.

(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (1), no injunction or

enjoining order shall be granted by any Court restraining or

staying, or having the effect of restraining or staying, the

Commission, from commencing, or continuing, the conduct of an

investigation under this Act or from exercising any of the powers

conferred on it by this Act or from giving any direction under this

Act.

As such, any person aggrieved by the decision of the Bribery Commission

to institute criminal action must prefer such grievances to the Supreme

Court by way of a writ application. The unequivocal recognition of the

Supreme Courts writ jurisdiction in the Commission Act is in line with the

Proviso to Article 140 of the Constitution which provides that Parliament

may by law provide that in any such category of cases as may be specified

in such law, the jurisdiction conferred on the Court of Appeal by the

preceding provisions of this Article shall be exercised by the Supreme Court

and not by the Court of Appeal

The instant matter deals with a rare combination of the core of both

Criminal law and Public law as on the one hand, it impugns the validity

LTA-6-16 Page 5 of 6 23/02/2022 IJ-08-22

of the institution of criminal proceedings and on the other, impugns an

act of an institution which is dispensing a public duty. This unique

situation was addressed by a Divisional Bench of the Court of Appeal in

Ajahn Gardiye Punchihewa v Officer in Charge Financial Investigation

Unit III CA (Writ) Application No. WRT 311/2019 CA Minute 18.06.2020

where the petitioner primarily sought to quash the institution of

proceedings before the Permanent High Court at Bar by issuance of a Writ

of Certiorari and stay the said prosecution by issuance of a Writ of

Prohibition. The petitioner in Ajahn Punchihewa (Supra) argued that the

decision by the Attorney General to institute criminal proceedings against

him was taken arbitrarily, capriciously, unreasonably, irrationally and in

haste, without due consideration to the applicable legal provisions as

stipulated in the Judicature Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No. 15 of 1979. Thus, the petitioner in Ajahn Punchihewa (Supra) relied

on the writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to challenge the validity of

institution of criminal proceedings against him. The following excerpt from

the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Ajahn Punchihewa (Supra) clearly

delineates that in the event a similar challenge is made to the institution

of criminal proceedings under the CIABOC Act, the party must canvass

the same before the Supreme Court and not the Court of Appeal:

...It is to be noted that these provisions (Section 12A(1)(a) of the

Judicature Act) are similarly applicable to the Director General for

the Prevention of Bribery and Corruption, who could institute criminal

proceedings before the Permanent High Court at Bar, on the direction

of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption

as well. Section 24(1) of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of

Bribery or Corruption Act No. 19 of 1994, had invested the Supreme

Court with the jurisdiction conferred upon this Court under Article

LTA-6-16 Page 6 of 6 23/02/2022 IJ-08-22

140 of the Constitution in respect of the said Commission and

therefore, the prosecutions instituted by the said Commission are

outside the preview of this Court.

(At Page 12, emphasis added)

Even Anoma Polwatte (Supra), the judgment upon which the respondent

has based his preliminary objection, was a writ application before the

Supreme Court, filed in terms of article 140 of the Constitution of the

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, read with the provisions of

section 24 (1) of the Commission Act. The caption of the instant application

reads In the matter of an application for Leave to Appeal in terms of

Section 15 of the Judicature Act read with Section 331 of the Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and Section 13(2) of the Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act No. 19 of 1994.

As such, it is the considered view of this Court that the preliminary

objection raised by the respondent deals with a subject matter that cannot

be canvassed before the Court of Appeal.

Accordingly, the substantive matter is re-fixed for support.
