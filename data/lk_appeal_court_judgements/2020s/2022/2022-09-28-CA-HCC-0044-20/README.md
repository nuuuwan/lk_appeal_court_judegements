Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Kuliyapitiya for causing the death of one Uswatta

Liyanage Kalum Sameera on 07th June 2008, and thereby committing the

offence of murder, punishable in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, the learned High Court Judge of Kuliyapitiya by his

judgement dated 26-06-2020, found the appellant guilty as charged, and the

appellant was sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant preferred

this appeal.

Facts in Brief

The deceased Kalum Sameera was the younger brother of PW-01 Asanka Milroy.

He was 23 years old at the time this incident has happened. While sleeping in

his home on 07-06-2008 around 12 midnight, PW-01 has received a call to his

mobile phone. It was his brother Kalum Sameera. He has informed the PW-01

that, . . The

Page 3 of 15

witness has been informed that he is near the house of Suresh, who was a friend

of his brother.

Immediately after receiving this message, the witness along with his younger

brother Manjula, has travelled to the place where the deceased informed that he

is waiting. He has found his brother in front of the house, crying and with burn

injuries. When questioned as to what happened, the injured has uttered the

same words as before. Thereafter, the witness has taken steps to admit his

brother to the Kuliyapitiya hospital. After being warded there for 3 days, he has

been transferred to Colombo General Hospital where he has succumbed to his

injuries six days after the admission.

The witness has met his brother for the last time around 4.30 p.m. on the day of

the incident, where he has informed the witness that he is going to Kurusa

Palliya in Marawila along with the appellant Ananda Kumara. He has met his

brother again around 5.30 in the evening, travelling on a motorbike with the

appellant, while he was waiting near the bus stand in the Naaththandiya

Colombo road,

PW-02 Manjula was the other brother who went and saw the deceased after being

informed by PW-01 about what has happened to him. He too had been informed

by the deceased that Ananda set him on fire after pouring petrol on him. He has

been informed further that both the appellant and the deceased consumed liquor

and the appellant set fire to the deceased using a cigarette lighter.

PW-14 Indika Jayasekara was the police officer who has recorded the statement

of the deceased Kalum Sameera while he was receiving treatment in the

Kuliyapitiya Base Hospital. After being satisfied that he was in a position to

communicate and conscious, he has recorded the deceaseds statement. The said

statement has been marked as P-01 at the trial, However, I find that the

prosecution has failed to draw the attention of the Court to the relevant portion

of the statement relied on by the prosecution as a dying declaration and the

witness has failed to give evidence as to what was told to him by the deceased.

Page 4 of 15

According to the evidence of Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who conducted the

postmortem on the deceased (postmortem report marked P-2), the death has

been due to Septicemia following extensive burn injuries.

In his evidence, the JMO has explained his findings in the following manner:

, 58%

. 50% 40%

, .

.

, , , ,

.

.

.

In this matter, the police officers who conducted investigations as to the crime

have given evidence explaining their investigations as to the crime.

It needs to be noted that during the prosecution case, the appellant has not

taken any stand or a defence, other than questioning the witnesses on the

evidence given by them.

At the conclusion of the prosecution case and when the appellant was called for

a defence, he has chosen to give evidence under oath. In his evidence, he has

admitted that he and the deceased went to Kurusa Palliya on the day of the

incident in his motorcycle and later consumed arrack in a rocky area in

Udubeddawa. He has stated that since his bike did not have sufficient petrol, he

purchased a bottle of petrol from a nearby shop and kept it near them while

consuming liquor. It was his position that, while consuming liquor, the deceased

requested for his motorbike to go to Kuliyapitiya in order to see his girlfriend and

because he did not agree, the deceased got angry and uttered an obscene word

and took the petrol bottle which was nearby, and poured the petrol over the rock

on which they were seated. It was his position that, after doing that, the deceased

attempted to light a cigarette using the lighter and because of the petrol poured

Page 5 of 15

on to the rock, it was set on fire suddenly. As a result, the lower part of the

deceaseds body started burning.

He has contended further, that although he attempted to rescue the deceased, it

failed, as the deceased ran away from the scene. He has stated that without

knowing what to do, he phoned his elder brother asking him to come and also

phoned one of the brothers of the deceased to inform what happened. Although

he looked for the deceased, he could not find him and later he was informed that

he was hospitalized by others, was his stand taken in his evidence.

It was his position that he never set fire on the deceased and he was not guilty

to the charge.

The Grounds of Appeal

The learned Presidents Counsel in his submissions before the Court formulated

the following grounds of appeal for consideration.

1. That the learned High Court Judge failed to take into consideration that

there was no motive for the appellant to commit this offence.

2. According to the postmortem report, the deceased has died due to an

infection as a result of the injuries sustained. The learned High Court

Judge has failed to adequately consider that fact and the JMO has

failed to prove adequately as to the reason for the death.

3. In view of the position taken up by the accused, the learned High Court

Judge should have considered the fact whether the incident was an

accident.

4. In view of the circumstances of the case, the learned High Court Judge

should have considered whether this was a case of culpable homicide

not amounting to murder.

It was the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel that this is a case where

the matter has been decided solely on a dying declaration by the deceased. Such

Page 6 of 15

a dying deposition should be treated with utmost care in the evaluation was his

position.

It was the view of the learned Presidents Counsel that, given the fact that there

was no motive for the appellant to commit the murder of the deceased and given

the other facts and the circumstances, the learned High Court Judge should

have considered the possibility of an accident. It was also his view that the

learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the matters in favour of the

appellant in this regard. Commenting on the evidence of the Judicial Medical

Officer, it was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel that since the

deceased has died, as a result of Septicemia, it was the duty of the JMO to

explain the reasons for his conclusions, which the JMO has failed to do in his

evidence. It was also the position of the learned Presidents Counsel, if evaluated

properly, the evidence placed before the Court leads only towards the conclusion

that this was an accident or at least an offence in terms of section 298 of the

Penal Code, and not a case of murder as concluded by the learned High Court

Judge in his judgement.

Replying the learned Presidents Counsel, it was the position of the learned

Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) that it is settled law, that the motive is

not a matter that needs to be established for a crime of this nature to be proved,

although it would be a plus factor if it can be so established. It was his view that

there was no evidence placed before the learned High Court Judge to consider

the incident as a result of an accident or a matter that could be considered in

terms of section 298 of the Penal Code. It was his position that the dying

depositions made by the deceased on several occasions are cogent and

trustworthy that the Court can rely solely on the dying depositions to find the

appellant guilty. He also points to the fact that the appellant has never

confronted the relevant witnesses when they gave evidence before the High Court

as to the stand taken by him in his evidence when called for a defence.

Page 7 of 15

Making submissions as to the evidence of the JMO, it was his position that the

JMO has given clear evidence that when a person suffered this kind of burn

injuries, the death is inevitable and it is only a matter of time, depending on the

injured persons ability to withhold the injuries. It was his position that when a

person suffers burn injuries of this magnitude, as shown by evidence, the death

will invariably be due to infections of the injuries as established in this action.

It was also his view that the doctors evidence clearly suggestive that the burn

injuries found on the head and the face, as well as the legs of the deceased are

injuries caused as a result of pouring petrol on the deceased as stated by him in

his dying deposition.

The learned SDSG moved for the dismissal of the appeal as it was devoid of any

merit.

The Considerations of The Grounds of Appeal

As the grounds of appeal raised by the learned Presidents Counsel are

interrelated, all the grounds will be considered together.

Since this is an action that has been determined based on the dying depositions

of the deceased, I think it is nothing but proper to consider the law relating to

dying depositions before considering the grounds of appeal in detail.

Section 32 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance, which refers to the relevancy of a

statement of a person who is dead and as to the transaction which resulted in

his death, reads as follows;

32 (1). When the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his

death, or to any of the circumstances of the transaction which

resulted in his death, in cases in which cause of death of that persons

death comes into question.

Such statements are relevant whether the person who made them was

or was not, at the time when they were made, under expectation of

Page 8 of 15

death, and whether and whether may be in the nature of the

proceedings in which the cause of his death comes into question.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his book The Law of Evidence, Volume I, at page

466 gives the summary of conditions of admissibility under section 32(1) in the

following manner;

In Sri Lanka, the conditions of admissibility are said to be:

(1) Death of the declarant before the proceedings.

(2) The statement must relate to the cause of his death or any of the

circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death.

(3) The case must be such that the cause of the declarants death must

come into question.

(4) The competency of the declarant to testify may have to be established,

depending upon circumstances of each case, but strict rules of

competency do not apply.

(5) The statement must be a complete verbal statement, though it may take

the form of question and answer or appropriate gestures. It must be

complete in itself and capable of definite meaning.

At page 469, citing several decided cases, Coomaraswamy discusses the

probative value of evidence, infirmities of such evidence, the necessary

directions, in the following manner;

The probative value of dying declarations relevant under section 32 (1)

would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But there is

no doubt that such evidence suffers from certain intrinsic infirmities. Two

of these defects are the fact that the statement was not made under oath

and the absence of cross-examination of the deponent of the statement.

Page 9 of 15

The following matters require consideration in regard to the proper

directions:

(1) The deceased not being before the court as a witness, and not

having made the statement under oath, this is an infirmity in the

evidence in the evidence of the statement.

(2) The statement has not been tested by cross-examination.

(3) The weight that should be attributed to the statement admitted

in the circumstances of a given case.

(4) If in a dying declaration, there is material favorable to the

accused, the judge should refer to it.

(5) Corroboration is not always necessary to support a dying

declaration.

In the case of The King Vs. Asirvadan Nadar, 51 NLR 322;

Where in a trial for murder, the dying deposition of the deceased was led

in evidence against the accused under section 32(1) of the Evidence

Ordinance.

The question how far the other facts and surrounding circumstances proved

in evidence might be said to support the truth or otherwise of the deposition.

When it comes to the facts relevant to this case, the declarant has passed away

before the proceeding commenced, and his statement directly relates to his cause

of death and the circumstance which resulted in his death. According to the

evidence of PW-01 and PW-02, the two brothers of the deceased, when they

reached the deceased, although he was in pain from the burn injuries suffered,

he was well conscious and has stated what happened to him and who did what.

When the police officer recorded the statement marked P-01 as well, the deceased

was in a position to speak and narrate the incident. The deceased has made the

Page 10 of 15

dying declaration in a form of a complete verbal statement with a definite

meaning, without any ambiguity.

The probative value of the dying declaration is a matter that has to be considered

before such a declaration can be accepted as evidence in a case of this nature.

There was clear evidence before the trial Court to establish that the deceased

and the appellant were together at the time of the incident. The appellant in his

evidence has admitted that fact and that they were consuming liquor and were

alone. The appellant has admitted that the deceased received burn injuries while

being with him, but has claimed in his evidence that it was an accident and not

a deliberate act committed by him.

Under the circumstance, it is my considered view that, even considered with its

inherent deficiencies a dying declaration may carry as stated above, this is a

declaration that can be considered as a statement made as to what really

happened to him and the witnesses are telling the truth as to what they heard.

It is settled law that corroboration is not always a must in proving a case based

on a dying declaration.

The rules laid down by the Indian Supreme Court in this regard may be

summarized as follows:

1. Ordinarily it is not safe to abuse a conviction for murder only upon the

dying declaration of the deceased when there is no corroboration of it

from any independent source. Such corroboration may be by

circumstantial evidence, or an oral statement made to a relative shortly

after the incident may corroborate a subsequent duly recorded dying

declaration.

2. Though ordinarily corroboration must be looked for, there is no

absolute rule of law or prudence that corroboration is always necessary

before a conviction which rests on a dying declaration can be sustained.

Corroboration is necessary when the declaration is an incomplete

Page 11 of 15

statement which is not categoric in accusation as to a crime against a

named person, or when the declaration suffers from some infirmity.

3. Where the Court is satisfied that the dying declaration is true and

reliable and does not suffer from any infirmity, a conviction can be

based on it even in the absence of corroboration. Each case must be

judged on its own facts. If it is proved that the dying declarations were

made without any prompting or influence by anyone and there is no

cogent reason given or suggested by the accused for throwing doubt on

their truth or correctness, the conviction can be based solely on them.

[See the Law of Evidence Volume-1 page 471, by E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy]

The first ground of appeal urged by the learned Presidents Counsel was that

there was no reason or motive for the appellant to commit the crime against the

deceased as they were good friends.

As pointed out correctly by the Senior Deputy solicitor General (SDSG) for the

respondent and agreed by the learned Presidents Counsel, the motive is not a

necessary ingredient that needs to be proved in a criminal case, although it may

be beneficial if established.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, in The Law of Evidence - Volume I at page 224

discusses the relevancy of motive in a criminal case in the following manner;

In criminal cases, it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove a motive

or the adequacy of the motive, if any, in order to establish the charge. The

motive which induces a man to do a particular act is known to him and

him alone. Therefore, the prosecution is not bound to prove a motive for

the offence, though it can suggest a motive, and when it do so, the judge

or jury can examine it.

Page 12 of 15

Where there is clear evidence that a person has committed an offence, it

is immaterial that no motive has been proved, or that the evidence of

motive is not clear.

I find no relevancy of the motive in this matter as considered above, and no basis

for the first ground of appeal.

I am in no position to agree with the learned Presidents Counsel as to the second

ground of appeal either.

It is correct that the cause of death of the deceased was septicemia, but as a

result of the burn injuries he suffered according to the post mortem report. The

nexus between the injuries and the cause of death has been well explained by

the JMO in his evidence as I have highlighted earlier, and further, in his

evidence. It is abundantly clear that the septicemia has set in as a result of the

extensive burn injuries suffered by the deceased. According to the evidence of

the JMO, death is inevitable for a person who has suffered this magnitude of

burn injuries.

In the case of Sumansiri Vs. Attorney General (1999) 1 SLR, 309, it was Held:

(1) Death was traceable to direct cardio-cerebral injury inflicted by the first

accused-appellant on the head of the deceased with a heavy

sledgehammer using considerable force. The prosecution case thus

comes within the purview of close 3 to section 294 of the Penal Code. An

accused person is liable not only for the direct consequences of his act

but he is equally liable for the consequences of any supervening condition

which is directly traceable to his act.

(2) If the original wound was still the operation cause and is a substantial

cause and the death can properly be said to be the result of the wound,

although some other cause of death was also operating, the offence is

murder, only if it can be said that the original wound was merely the

setting in which another cause operates, can it be said that the death did

not result from the wound. Putting it another way, only if the second

Page 13 of 15

cause was so overwhelming as to make the original wound merely part

of its history can it be said that the death does not flow from the original

wound.

(3) Any controverted issue relating to causation ought to be decided

according to rational and common-sense principles. Where there was no

breach in the line of causation despite the fact that the surgical operation

was performed at a time posterior to the infliction of the injury and at a

point of time anterior to the death, the offence is murder if the act is done

with the intention of causing bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary

course of nature to cause death. (if the injury is left to nature without

resorting to proper medical remedies and skillful treatment would cause

death)

The argument that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the

evidence that was in favor of the appellant that this could have been an accident,

was the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel, which was the third

ground of appeal urged.

The appellant has failed to put any questions to the relevant witness when they

gave evidence as to the possibility of an accident.

It was only when the appellant was called for his defence, the appellant has come

out with a story of an accident.

In the case of Sarwan Singh Vs. State of Punjab 2002 AIR Supreme Court iii

3652 at 3655, 3656 it was stated thus;

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to

avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross examination, it

must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted.

His Lordship Sisra de Abrew, J. in the case of Pilippu Mandige Nalaka

Krishantha Thisera Vs. The Attorney General, CA 87/2005 decided on 17-

05-2007 held:

Page 14 of 15

.I hold whenever evidence is given by a witness on a material point is

not challenged in cross-examination, it has to be concluded that such

evidence is not disputed and is accepted by the opponent subject of course

to the qualification that the witness is a reliable witness.

If he called the brother of the deceased and informed that such a thing happened,

that position should have been put to PW-01 and PW-02 when they gave

evidence, which has not been done. The evidence of the elder brother of the

deceased was that it was his deceased brother who gave a call around midnight

from a house of a friend called Suresh. If it was he who wanted to give medical

aid to the deceased as soon as possible, confronting the brother of the accused

when he gave evidence should have been the first step towards adding value to

the story of the appellant in his evidence towards creating a doubt as to the

evidence of the prosecution witnesses. It is clear that the story of an accident

due to the actions of the deceased himself was an afterthought, but without

merit.

If it was an accident as claimed by the appellant, there was no reason for him to

be out of the vicinity when the brothers of the deceased arrived at the place where

the deceased was found, as it was his duty to offer help to his friend who was

consuming liquor with him and got himself burned due to his own actions as

claimed.

The argument advanced that the deceased had burn injuries to his lower part of

the body, and that was in line with the position of the appellant that when the

deceased attempted to light a cigarette while seated, the petrol fumes on the

ground caused the fire.

When considering the uncontradicted evidence of the JMO, it is clear that the

deceased had burn injuries on the head and the face, in addition to injuries to

the thighs and the legs. If it was the poured petrol which was on the rock that

triggered the fire, there is no possibility of the deceased having burn injuries to

his head and the face.

Page 15 of 15

I find that the learned High Court Judge has well considered the position taken

up by the appellant in his evidence with the view of considering that whether it

has created any doubt as to the prosecution evidence and come to a firm finding

in that regard, for which I have no reason to disagree.

The appellant has not taken any defence on the basis that the incident was

culpable homicide not amount to murder in terms of section 297 of the Penal

Code at the trial. It is trite law that it is the duty of a trial judge to consider

whether there is a possibility of culpable homicide not amounting to murder even

if an accused had not taken such a position before the trial judge, only if there

is evidence before the trial judge in that regard. I do not find any evidence before

the trial judge to come to such a conclusion, hence, no basis for the fourth

ground of appeal.

I find that the appellant has been rightly convicted by the learned High Court

Judge based on the dying declarations made by the deceased and the attending

facts and circumstances.

The appeal is dismissed as it is devoid of any merit. The conviction and the

sentence affirmed.
