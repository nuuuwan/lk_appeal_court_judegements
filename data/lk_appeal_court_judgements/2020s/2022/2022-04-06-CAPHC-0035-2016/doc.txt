Judgment The Plaintiff-Additional Commissioner of Agrarian Services instituted action in the Magistrates

Court of Pugoda bearing case No. 66555 against the 1st and 2nd Respondents in terms of Section

90(4) of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 as amended by Act No. 46 of 2011.

The said action had been taken up for Trial and after the conclusion of the Trial, the learned

Magistrate delivered the Judgment on 15.09.2009, in favour of the Plaintiff and had found the 1st

and 2nd Respondents guilty of the charge. 1st and 2nd Respondents were sentenced for six months

imprisonment and for a fine of Rs. 5000/-, and in default another six months imprisonment. Being

aggrieved by the said Judgment 1st and 2nd Respondents preferred an appeal to the High Court of

Gampaha. Since no right of appeal lies against the said Judgment, the 1st and 2nd Respondents had

thereafter invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court of Gampaha in revision

application bearing No. 33/2013.

However, the learned High Court Judge having inquired the said revision application had made an

Order on 23.02.2016, upholding the Judgment of the learned Magistrate but partly allowing the

said revision application by suspending the rigorous imprisonment for a period of 5 years.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned High Court Judge dated 23.02.2016, the 1st and

2nd Respondent-Petitioner-Appellants [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellants] had

preferred this appeal seeking to set aside the Order of the Magistrates Court of Pugoda dated

15.09.2009 and the said Order of the learned High Court Judge.

It appears that this revision application was made on 31.07.2013, against the Order of the learned

Magistrate dated 15.09.2009, nearly four years from date of the impugned Order of the learned

Magistrate.

Page 4 of 7

However, the Appellants have explained the delay in filing the revision application. It was

submitted by the Appellants that the Appellants had preferred an appeal bearing No. 76/2009

against the Order of the learned Magistrate on 16.09.2009, to the High Court of Gampaha, which

was dismissed on 05.01.2013, since there was no right of appeal given against an Order made

under Section 90 of the Agrarian Development Act.

Subsequently, the Appellants had filed a leave to appeal application on 24.01.2013 to the Supreme

Court against the said Order of the learned High Court Judge dated 09.01.2013, which was also

dismissed on a technical defect refusing to grant a leave to appeal of the said application to

Supreme Court.

Be that as it may, it is relevant to note that the appeal before this Court is an appeal preferred

against the Order made by the learned High Court Judge exercising revisionary jurisdiction. As

such, it is seen that the duty of this Court is to consider an appeal preferred against the Order of

the Provincial High Court in exercising its revisionary jurisdiction and not to consider an appeal

made against the Order of the learned Magistrate.

It was held in the case of Nandawathi and another Vs. Mahindasena [(2009) 2 SLR 218],

When an Order of a Primary Court Judge is challenged by way of revision in the High

Court, the High Court can exercise only the legality of that Order and not the correction

of that Order.

It was emphasized by Ranjith Silva J. that;

I am of the opinion that this particular right of appeal in the circumstances should not

be taken as an appeal in the true sense, but in fact as an application to examine the

correctness, legality or the propriety of the Order made by the High Court Judge in the

exercise of revisionary powers. The Court of Appeal should not under the guise of an

appeal attempt to re-hear or re-evaluate the evidence led in the main case.

In view of the aforecited Judgment, we are not supposed to consider this as an appeal preferred

against the Order of the Magistrates Court. We are of the view that the task before this Court is

Page 5 of 7

to ascertain whether this appeal emanates from an Order pronounced by the Provincial High Court

in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction. Thus, the Court of Appeal is empowered to evaluate

the correctness of the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction by the Provincial High Court.

Similarly, the Provincial High Courts too be needful when exercising revisionary jurisdiction in

respect of the applications made against the Orders of the Magistrates Court and should be

considered these as revision applications and not as appeals.

It appears that the Defendant-Petitioner [Appellants] had invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of

the Provincial High Court in terms of Article 138 of the Constitution read with Article 154 (3) (b)

of the Constitution.

Article 154 (3) (b) states that, notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any Law, a

Provincial High Court shall exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of

convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by Magistrates Court and Primary Court

within the province.

Since this appeal emanates from the Order of the Provincial High Court exercising revisionary

jurisdiction against the Order of the Magistrate who found the Appellant guilty for the charge

levelled against them and punished for six months imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 5000/-, it clearly

manifests that the provisions relating to revision, in Chapter XXIX of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, are applicable to the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court in respect of the Orders made by the Magistrates Court.

It appears that the Court exercising revisionary jurisdiction in terms of Section 364 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act, Court had power to call for and examine the record of any case

irrespective of whether they are already fixed as pending, in the High Court or the Magistrates

Court. This power can be exercised for any of the following purposes;

1. To satisfy Court as to the legality of any Sentence or Order passed by the High Court or

the Magistrates Court.

2. To satisfy this Court as to the propriety of any Sentence or Order passed by such Court.

3. To satisfy this Court as to the regularity of proceedings of such Court.

Page 6 of 7

Thus, it is seen that revisionary jurisdiction in terms of Section 364 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 is wide and is specifically directed at vesting a jurisdiction in this

Court to satisfy itself as to the legality or propriety of any sentence passed by the High Court or

the Magistrates Court [Attorney General Vs. Ranasinghe & Others (1993) 2 SLR 81].

It is to be observed that the learned High Court Judge had considered the Judgment of the learned

Magistrate and had upheld the reasoning therein.

It is noteworthy that the learned Magistrate had also taken into consideration the settlement entered

on 11.07.2008 in case bearing No. 1299, where the Appellants had agreed for the Agrarian Officers

to clear the obstructions on the agricultural road.

Apparently, the learned High Court Judge has determined the Order of the learned Magistrate was

correct in facts and Law regarding the charges against the Appellant.

The learned High Court Judge had only suspended the sentencing and has not in any way amended

the decision pertaining to the culpability of the Appellants.

Furthermore, the learned Magistrate had determined that, there was an agricultural road in use

since 1950s road via which even tractors and farming equipment had been taken to the paddy

fields. This roads had been obstructed by the Appellants since 2001 and it had been temporarily

removed by the Agrarian Officers. Moreover, the Appellants had once again obstructed the

agricultural road at another point which reflects they were guilty of an offence in terms of the Law.

Page 7 of 7

In view of the aforesaid reasons, it is observable that the Appellants had not satisfied Court with

regard to the criterion embodied in Section 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to consider

in revisionary proceedings such as, legality of any Order, propriety of any Order and regularity of

the proceedings of such Court.

It appears that the Appellants had justified the delay of filing the impugned application for revision.

We are of the view that the learned High Court Judge had analysed and evaluated the evidence

placed before the learned Magistrate and had affirmed the Order of the Magistrate, thus, the Order

of the learned High Court Judge is well founded.

In this instance, it is submitted that, to exercise revisionary powers against the Order challenged,

it must be manifestly erroneous and needs to have occasioned a miscarriage of Justice, which goes

beyond an error, defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would instantly react to it and the

impugned Order, would have shocked the conscience of Court.

Apparently, in view of the findings of the learned High Court Judge, the Appellants had not

disclosed exceptional circumstances, which would warrant the intervention of the Provincial High

Court by way of an application for revision.

Thus, it clearly manifest that the learned High Court Judge had correctly affirmed the Order of the

learned Magistrate and had dismissed the Appellants application for revision. As such, we see no

reason for us to interfere with the Order dated 09.01.2013 by the learned High Court Judge and

the Order dated 15.09.2009 by the learned Magistrate. Hence, we dismiss the appeal with cost

fixed at Rs. 50,000/-.
