This application concerns an appeal by the Registered Owner-Petitioner-

Appellant (Hereinafter, the appellant) pleading for the vehicle confiscation order

issued by the Magistrates Court of Matara on 25.01.2019 and its affirmation by

the High Court of Matara on 16.07.2021, to be set aside.

The facts of the case briefly are as follows. The accused was charged in the

Magistrates Court of Matara (case number 45734) under the Animals Act, No. 29

of 1958 (last amended in 2009) for unlawfully transporting 11 bulls using the

lorry bearing No. SP LE-9581 on the 03.07.2011. The accused pleaded guilty to

the charges and was fined, and subsequently a vehicle inquiry was held. After

evaluating the submissions made by the appellant, the learned Magistrate had

ordered the confiscation of the said vehicle on the ground that the appellant has

failed to satisfy the court of the requirements imposed on him by the law as the

owner of the vehicle, have been fulfilled by the appellant. Being aggrieved by the

said order, the appellant has invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the High

Court of Matara, and the learned High Court Judge has dismissed the application

upholding the confiscation order.

The learned High Court Judge in judgment dated 16.07.2021 has acknowledged

that the learned Magistrate has misquoted the relevant section 3A of the Animals

Act due to a technical error. However, the spirit of the provision has been

captured by the learned Magistrate and she has gone on to evaluate facts under

both requirements given in proviso to Section3A.

The learned High Court Judge has also analysed both limbs of the proviso to

Section 3A of the Act which are as follows:

Provided, however, that in any case where the owner of the vehicle is a

third party, no order of confiscation shall be made, if the owner proves to

the satisfaction of the Court that he has taken all precautions to

prevent the use of such vehicle or that the vehicle has been used

without his knowledge for the commission of the offence. (Emphasis

added)

CA/PHC/33-21 Page 4 of 6 08/11/2022 IJ-51-22

The learned High Court judge has considered the facts of the case and evaluated

them under both limbs, and has been satisfied that neither of the two has been

proved on a balance of probability. The vehicle being released to the appellant for

merely stating that he was ignorant of the offence being committed or merely

instructing the person to whom he rented out his vehicle not to use it for illegal

purposes, without establishing facts to the satisfaction of the Court has not been

the legislative intent in introducing Section 3A proviso.

The appellant who had purchased the vehicle through a leasing facility for hiring

out the vehicle, had lent it to one Liafdeen on monthly rent. The learned

Magistrates and the learned High Court Judges considered view has been that

the appellant had been unable to substantially establish on a balance of

probability that he was unaware that Liafdeen, who he entrusted the vehicle to,

was a butcher who dealt with cattle and had previous convictions in illegal

transportation of cattle (Appeal Brief pages 115 and 41, respectively).

It must be noted at this point that the onus of proving this is on the appellant as

per the proviso to Section 3A of the Act which stipulates if the owner proves to

the satisfaction of the court that either of the two limbs were satisfied. Doing a

bare-minimum background check on the person who one rents out his vehicle

to, is a reasonable expectation from a responsible and diligent owner of a vehicle.

Even though the appellant has stated that a written rent agreement exists

between Liafdeen and himself, he has been unable to produce it before the Court.

And upon gaining knowledge that Liafdeen had handed over the possession of

the vehicle to one Hussain without his knowledge, the appellant has taken no

additional precautions to ensure that the vehicle is not being used for any

suspicious/illegal activity by an unknown party. Neither Liafdeen nor the

accused Hussain have given evidence at the inquiry to corroborate the appellants

ignorance of what the vehicle was being used for.

The learned Magistrate has also in detail considered the first limb of the proviso;

how the petitioner has failed to take all precautions to prevent the use of the

vehicle for committing an offence (pages 116-117 of the Appeal brief).

CA/PHC/33-21 Page 5 of 6 08/11/2022 IJ-51-22

As clearly stated in the case, Faaris v OIC Galenbindunuwewa 1992(1) SLR 167

which has been referred to by both the learned Magistrate and the learned High

Court Judge,

In terms of the proviso to Section 3A of the Animals Act, an order for

confiscation cannot be made if the owner establishes one of two matters.

They are, (i) that he has taken all precautions to prevent the use of the

vehicle for the commission of the offence. (2) That the vehicle has been used

for the commission of the offence without his knowledge.

In terms of the proviso, if the owner establishes any one of these matters on

a balance of probability, an order for confiscation should not be made.

Thus, it is well-established law that either one of these requirements should be

satisfied on a balance of probability if the vehicle is to be released to the registered

owner.

As His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew in the case of Mary Matilda Silva V.

P.H. De Silva, IP Police Station Habarana [CA (PHC) 86/97, decided on

08.07.2010] highlighted succinctly, a heavy burden is placed on the owner of

vehicle to be discharged if he/she is to secure release of the vehicle,

"In my view, for the owner of the vehicle to discharge the burden (1) that he or

she had taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the

commission of the offence, (2) that the vehicle had been used for the

commission of the offence without his/her knowledge, mere giving instructions

is not sufficient. In order to discharge the burden embodied in the proviso to

Section 3A of the Animals Act, is it sufficient for the owner to say that the

instructions not to use the vehicle for illegal purpose had been given to the

driver? If the Courts of this country is going to say that it is sufficient, then all

what the owner in a case of this nature has to say is that he gave said

instructions. Even for the second offence, this is all that he has to say. Then

there is no end to the commission of the offence and to the use of the vehicle

for the commission of the offence. Every time when the vehicle is detected with

cattle all what he has to say is that he had given instructions to the driver.

CA/PHC/33-21 Page 6 of 6 08/11/2022 IJ-51-22

Then the purpose of the legislature in enacting the proviso to section 3A of the

Animals Act is frustrated."

Therefore, it is clear that neither of the two limbs, one of which if established on

a balance of probability would have been sufficient to exonerate the owner, has

been satisfactorily established by the appellant.

Therefore, in light of the above, it is the considered view of this Court that even

though the learned Magistrate has misquoted Section 3A of the Act due to a

technical error, her order for confiscation was correct in law, having considered

the facts in light of both limbs stated therein, and has not prejudiced the

Appellant. The judgement of the learned High Court Judge of Matara affirming

the confiscation order of the learned Magistrate is similarly in accordance with

the law. Thus, this Court sees no reason to interfere with the decisions of both

the learned High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate.

Appeal is hereby dismissed.
