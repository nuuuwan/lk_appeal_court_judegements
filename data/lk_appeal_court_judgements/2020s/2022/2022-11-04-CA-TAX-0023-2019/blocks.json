But the delay should not render null and void the proceedings and prejudicially affect the parties, as the parties have no control over the proceedings. It could not have been intended that the delay should cause a loss of the jurisdiction that the Commissioner had, to give an effective order of approval or refuse.

One has to give a practical and a meaningful interpretation to the usual day to day functions or steps taken in a court of law or a statutory body involved in quasi-judicial functions, duty or obligation. If specific time limits are to be laid down the legislature need to say so in very clear unambiguous terms instead of leaving it to be interpreted in various ways. To give a restricted interpretation would be to impose unnecessary sanctions on the Board of Review. It would be different or invalid if the time period exceeded 2 years",

The learned Counsel cited the following extract from Lord Woolf, Sir Jeffrey Jowell, Catherine Donnelly and Ivan Hare (eds), in De Smiths Judicial Review26 which reads thus; The Carltona principle may be expressly excluded by legislation, but whether it may in addition be excluded by statutory implication remains uncertain. Two situations should be distinguished. Where a power of delegation is expressly conferred by Parliament on a minister, it may compel the inference that Parliament intended to restrict the devolution of power to the statutory method, thus impliedly excluding the Carltona principle. Commonwealth authority, however, suggests that such an implication will not readily be drawn. It has also been suggested that the principle may be impliedly excluded where it appears inconsistent with the",

To make the example of the present case, no doubt there have been thousands of requisitions in this country by individual ministries. It cannot be supposed that this regulation meant that in each case, the minister in person should direct his mind to the matter. The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers given to ministers are normally exercised under the authority of the ministers by responsible officials of the department. Public business could not be carried on if that were not the case. Constitutionally, the decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister. The minister is responsible. It is he who must answer before Parliament for anything that his officials have done under his authority, and, if for an important matter he selected an official of such junior standing that he could not be expected competently to perform the work, the minister would have to answer for that in Parliament. The whole system of departmental organisation and administration is based on the view that ministers, being responsible to Parliament, will see that important duties are committed to experienced officials. If they do not do that, Parliament is the place where complaint must be made against them\". [emphasis added].",

The functions of the Inland Revenue Department are so multifarious that no Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue could ever personally attend to all of them. In particular, Court will be slow to impose such requirements unless there is unequivocal language in the IR Act. It is true that the appeal has to be submitted to the respondent. However, that does not mean that the acknowledgement to be made by the respondent. Similar approach has been taken by our Courts in applying the Carltona principle in relation to administrative functions to be performed by Ministers (M.S.Perera v. Forest Department and another [(1982) 1 Sri. L.R. 187] amd Kuruppu v. Keerthi Rajapakse, Conservator of Forests [(1982) 1 Sri. L.R. 163]. The Appellants contention was that since the determination in the Lanka Ashok Leyland had been made within the stipulated two-year period, the foregoing statement of His Lordship Janak De Silva J., is obiter35. Yet, in my view, although the facts of the two cases are slightly different, the decision on the identical issue of validity the acknowledgment of an appeal by an Assessor was shed light on the case in hand.",

RMCC has further agreed not to produce any other product in the plant without the consent of the Appellant. The plant exclusively produces Vim scourer bars of which the trademark rights are assigned to the Appellant by the owner, Unilever PLC, United Kingdom. RMCC has to manufacture the goods according to the specifications and quantities communicated by the Appellant. It is true that the Appellant has retained the right to reject the finished products which are not in conformity with the quality specifications setup by the Appellant. However, in my view, it cannot be considered as a risk factor associated with the production. It is a condition imposed upon RMCC to meet the quality specifications setup by the Appellant. In fact, the risk of a lower yield is not with RMCC and it has been taken over by the Appellant by agreeing to make minimum payments quarterly to RMCC in order that the fixed costs incurred are covered in case of sales falling below the forecast volume51.",

Therefore, no valid sale of goods can take place in the transaction between RMCC and PSL, and USL. Since there is no passing of exclusive ownership of goods from RMCC and PSL to the USL, it amounts to a supply of services. The Appellant argued that RMCC and PSL are the sole parties engaged in all of the activities described in the definition of manufacturer of the Vim scourer bars and Signal toothbrushes, and therefore Appellant is not the manufacturer. However, it should be noted that section 3 of the VAT Act only applies to supply of goods. Contrastingly, RMCC and PSL are engaged in a supply of services. Thus, it is evident that the Appellant is the manufacturer of the supply of goods and not RMCC and PSL. Hence, the exemption claimed by the Appellant under section 3 of the VAT Act is not applicable here.",
