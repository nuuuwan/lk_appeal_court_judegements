C.P. Kirtisinghe J

The Petitioner is making this application for an Injunction under and in terms of Article 143 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. The Petitioner had entered into certain contracts with the 2nd Respondent for the construction of 14 buildings for Child Development Centres. Under those contracts, the Petitioner had entered into several Performance Bonds and Advance Payment Bonds marked P4(1) to P4(20). The Petitioner is seeking this Injunction preventing the 2nd Respondent from claiming and receiving upon those bonds and preventing the 1st Respondent from paying or releasing the monies to the 2nd Respondent in terms of any demand made on those bonds.

By the letter dated 16th June 2022 marked P5(22), the 2nd Respondent had informed the Petitioner that the Petitioner was not performing to the conditions of the contractual agreement entered into between the parties and the progress of the work was poor. The Petitioner was advised to catch up the progress of the work and it was informed that in case of any failure, action would be taken to terminate the contract and arrangements will be made to forfeit the Performance Bonds submitted. Thereafter, by letter dated 5th July 2022 marked P5(23), the Petitioner had suggested to the 2nd Respondent to enter into an agreement to discharge the contracts on mutually agreed terms and several terms had been suggested. Thereafter, by letter dated 1st September 2022 marked P6(1), the 2nd Respondent had granted a time extension until 31st October 2022 to complete the constructions and by letter dated 16th September 2022, the 2nd Respondent had informed the Petitioner that the partly completed projects should be completed on or before 30th November 2022. Further, the 2nd Respondent had requested the Petitioner to extend the Advance Payments and Performance Bonds until 28th December 2022. The 2nd Respondent had informed the Petitioner to enter into a revised contractual agreement on 27th September 2022.

Therefore, the 2nd Respondent was willing to extend the time period for the completion of the construction work and from the letter dated 20th September 2022 marked P6(11) it appears that the Petitioner was not agreeable to those

conditions. When one takes into consideration the conduct of the 2nd Respondent, a fraud on the part of the 2nd Respondent cannot be inferred.

In the case of Hemas Marketing (Pvt) Limited Chandrasiri and others (1994) 2 SLR 181, Dr Ranaraja J has observed as follows, When a bank has given a guarantee, it is required to honour it according to its terms and is not concerned whether either party to the contract which underlay the contract was in default. The whole purpose of such commercial instruments was to provide security which was to be readily, promptly and assuredly realizable when the prescribed event occurred. The only exception to the rue is where fraud by one of the parties to the underlying contract has been established and the bank had notice of the fraud. A mere plea of fraud put in for the purpose of bringing the case within this exception and which rests in the uncorroborated statements of the applicant will not suffice. In that judgment, Dr. Ranaraja J further observed as follows, It is only in exceptional circumstances that Courts will interfere with the machinery of obligations assumed by the banks. They are the lifeblood of international commerce. Such obligations are regarded as collateral to underlying rights and obligations between merchants at either end of the banking chain. Courts will leave the merchants to settle their disputes under the contract by litigation.

The same principle was accepted by S.N. Silva J in Indica Traders (Pvt) Limited v Seoul Lanka Constructions (Pvt) Limited and others (1994) 3 SLR 387.

The same principle will apply to this case also. There is no evidence of fraud on the part of the 2nd Respondent before this court and there is no evidence that the 1st Respondent Bank had any knowledge of such a fraud. It is only in exceptional circumstances that courts will interfere with the machinery of obligations assumed by the Banks. Therefore, this court cannot grant Injunctions preventing the 1st Respondent Bank from discharging the aforesaid bonds and preventing the 2nd Respondent from taking steps upon those bonds. If there is a violation of the contract which is an actionable wrong, the parties can settle their disputes under the contract by a separate action in an appropriate court.

For the aforementioned reasons, we dismiss this application for an Injunction under and in terms of Article 143 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
