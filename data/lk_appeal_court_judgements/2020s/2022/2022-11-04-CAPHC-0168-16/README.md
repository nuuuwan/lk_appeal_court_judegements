JUDGMENT

Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent [from now on referred to as Respondent] instituted an action

at the Magistrate Court of Bible under Urban Development Act No.41 of 1978 (as amended) to

Page 3 of 5

demolish a building constructed by Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant who will be referred to as

Appellant, for this appeal.

The Appellant is a businessman operating a small textile shop on Bible-Batticaloa Road.

With the written authority of the Vice-Chairman of Bible Pradeshiya Sabha, the small shop was

constructed in 2001. In the year 2002 same Vice-Chairman issued a letter of no objection to

obtaining electricity. In 2003, the Appellant obtained a trade license from the Pradeshiya Sabha

and had been in business since then.

In 2015, the Secretary of the Bible Pradeshiya Sabha instituted an action in the Magistrate's Court

under Section 28(A)(1) of the Urban Development Authority Law No.41 of 1978 to demolish the

building of the Appellant.

On 28.04.2016, the Magistrate of Bible held with the Respondents and ordered the Appellant to

demolish the building. Aggrieved by this order, the Appellant went before the High Court of

Monaragala, but even the learned High Court Judge had refused the plea of the Appellant. The

Appellant then invoked the jurisdiction of this Court.

The Appellant argued that since the construction is done with the permission of the Vice-Chairman

of the Pradeshiya Sabha, it becomes a lawful construction. Since the action field before the

Magistrate's Court was based on the land being a state land, the Secretary to the Pradeshya Sabha

cannot file an action under the Urban Development Authority law.

The question is, "does the Appellant have the authority to build? It will be discussed first. The

Appellant depends on the letter given to him by the Vice-Chairman and the letter of consenting by

the same person to obtain electricity.

The Respondents argued that the Appellant was informed by a registered post letter to remove the

construction. The Appellant had not produced a development permit in response to the letter or at

the Magistrate's Court.

The Respondents had argued that the Vice-Chairman has no authority to give permission. Within

the Predeshiya Sabha Limits, one can construct only on a valid Development permit under the

provisions of the Urban Development Authority Act. The Vice-Chairman gave the letter of

permission, which violates the rules and regulations of the Pradshiya Sabha.

Gazette Extraordinary No.87/7, dated 18.04.1980, declared the area in question as an Urban

Development Area. Once it is gazetted, the area comes under the Urban Development Authority

Act, and the letter given in the year 2000 becomes invalid. The case was filed in the Magistrate's

Court under Section 28(A)(3) of the Urban Development Area Act.

Therefore, the duty of the Appellant was to prove that he had obtained a valid development permit,

not a letter by an officer of the Pradeshiya Sabha, the only way to satisfy the Magistrate that the

Appellant's building was a lawful construction.

When considering the above position, we see no exceptional grounds that the learned High Court

Judge could have considered. As the Respondent pointed out, two Petition of Appeals is filed in

the brief.

On 09.11.2016, Attorney-at-Law Susantha Rathnayaka filed one appeal, and Attorney-at-Law

R.M. Gunathilake filed the 2nd Petition of appeal without a date but November 2016. The

Appellant cannot be careless. However, perusing both Petitions, they look similar.

Therefore, whichever is considered, the prayers and pleadings are the same. A perusal of the

Magistrate's Court's record indicated that the Appellant had only requested to settle with the

authorities and not given any explanation or argument regarding his rights. He had never argued

regarding the maintainability of the action filed against him. Therefore, the learned High Court

Judge observed that the Appellant had not taken any arguments raised before the High Court or at

the Magistrate Court.

In Jayaweera Vs. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services Rathpanpura and Another,1 "If a

litigant wishes to contradict the record, he must file necessary papers before the Court at the first

instance, institute an inquiry before the Court and thereafter raise the matter before the Appellate

Court. So, the Appellate Court would be in a position on the material to adjudicate the issues with

the benefit of the Court's order."

Unless the Appellant had challenged the authority of the Respondents to act under the provisions

of the Urban Development Authority Act before the Magistrate, he has no footing to raise that

argument before the High Court.

Since the Petitioner stated that Vice-Chairman granted permission, he had a duty to submit to court

material to prove that power, responsibilities and functions were delegated to the Vice-Chairman

to issue such a letter by law.

For the reasons discussed above, we dismiss the Appeal of the Appellant. We make no order for

costs.
