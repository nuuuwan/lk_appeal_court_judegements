Judgment

These appeals are emanating from the Order dated 05.05.2015 made by the Provincial High

Court of the Eastern Province holden in Ampara. The learned High Court Judge held with

the 1st Party Respondent-Petitioner-Respondents by setting aside the Order dated

05.06.2014 made by the learned Magistrate, who was acting as the Primary Court Judge.

It appears that the Officer-in-Charge of the Inginiyagala Police Station filed an information

on 08.01.1997 in terms of Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act upon the

complaint made by J.K.A. Jayawickrama Wilson, the 1st Party, over a land dispute informing

that Hewa Heenpellage Latha, the 2nd Party had been disputing the possession of the

subject matter of the action.

The matter was taken up for inquiry and at the inquiry, the matter was settled between

the parties and a settlement was entered on 27.05.1998. Upon the said settlement, the

learned Magistrate made an Order on 17.02.1999 to survey the disputed land.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the 1st Party Respondent-Petitioners [hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the 1st Party] had made an application bearing No. HC/REV/95/99

to the Provincial High Court of Ampara. Having inquired into the matter, the learned High

Court Judge by his Order dated 30.11.2000, revised and set aside the Orders of the learned

Magistrate and directed to recommence the inquiry.

Being aggrieved by said Order of the learned High Court Judge, the 2nd Party Respondent-

Respondents [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 2nd Party] preferred an appeal

bearing No. CA/Appeal/109/2002. The said appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in

terms of Rule 13(b) of the Supreme Court.

Thereafter, the 1st Party had made an application before the learned Magistrate to obtain

an Interim Order and it was refused by the learned Magistrate by Order dated 25.07.2013

and the entire action was dismissed on the basis that the subject matter had not been

identified at the time of filing of the information.

Page 5 of 8

Subsequent to the above, the 1st Party made an application to the learned Magistrate and

consequently, the learned Magistrate had made an Order dated 20.02.2014 restoring the

1st Party and the 2nd Party 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Appellants [Hewa Heenpallage

Wasanthi Kumari] [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 2nd Party 2nd Respondent]

possession to the lands in which the 1st Party and the 2nd Party 2nd Respondent were in

possession immediately before the dispute arose. The 1st Party were restored to the

possession of the high land and the 2nd Party 2nd Respondents possession was restored to

the paddy field. In view of the said Order, the learned Magistrate had issued a writ and the

writ was executed on 29.04.2014.

Thereafter, the 2nd Party 2nd Respondent had made an application to the learned Magistrate

to set aside the order executing the writ. In this instance, the learned Magistrate had made

an Order on 05.06.2014 effectuating the purported settlement entered on 27.05.1998,

which was subsequently set aside by the learned High Court Judge by Order dated

30.11.2000.

By effectuating the aforesaid purported settlement, the learned Magistrate had directed

to grant possession of Lot 1 and 2 of Plan bearing No.232 to the 2nd Party 2nd Respondent

and the high land to the 1st Party. Further, the 1st Party was ordered to pay Rs. 50,000 to

the 2nd Party 2nd Respondent.

Being aggrieved by the said Order dated 05.06.2014, the 1st Party had invoked the

revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court of Ampara by application bearing No.

/426/2014. It is to be noted that the 2nd Party 2nd Respondent also made an application by

way of revision bearing No. /427/2014 against the said Order dated 05.06.2014.

The learned High Court Judge considering both applications and had made an Order on

05.05.2015, expunging all Orders made after 17.02.1999.

Being aggrieved with the aforesaid Order dated 05.05.2015, the 2nd Party 2nd Respondent-

Respondent-Appellant [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant] had preferred

this appeal bearing No. CA (PHC) 51/2015, seeking to set aside the said Order dated

05.05.2015 and to have the Appellant restored to the land in which the Appellant was in

possession immediately before the dispute arose.

Page 6 of 8

The 1st Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellants too preferred an appeal bearing No. CA PHC

51A/2015, and sought an order to restore them to the land in which the Appellants were in

possession.

It is to be observed that the 2nd Party 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Appellant in appeal No.

CA (PHC) 51/2015 and 2nd Party Respondent-Respondent in appeal No. CA (PHC) 51A/2015

had not taken any interest in participating in these appeals and after issuing notices on

several occasions thus Court fixed both appeals to hear in the absence of the said Appellant

in appeal No. CA (PHC) 51/2015 and 2nd Party Respondent-Respondent in appeal No. CA

(PHC) 51A/2015.

However, it is seen that the 2nd Party 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Appellant in appeal No.

CA (PHC) 51/2015 had not paid brief fees after issuing notices on several occasions, thus

had not exercised due diligence to prosecute with the said appeal.

As such, we dismiss appeal No. CA (PHC) 51/2015 in terms of Rule 13 (b) of the Supreme

Court Rules.

However, it is relevant to note that the appeal bearing No. CA (PHC) 51A/2015 before us

is an appeal emanating against an Order pronounced by the Provincial High Court of Ampara

exercising its revisionary jurisdiction. Thus, the task before us is not to consider an appeal

made against the order made by the leaned Magistrate but to consider an appeal in which

an Order pronounced by the Provincial High Court of Ampara dated 05.05.2015 exercising

its revisionary jurisdiction is sought to be called in question.

Nevertheless, it is imperative to note that the Order on 05.06.2014 made by the learned

Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge is a provisional order. As such, the

rights of the parties have to be adjudicated by invoking civil jurisdiction of a competent

Court.

It is apparent that the intention of the Legislature in introducing Part VII of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act No.44 of 1979 is to prevent a breach of the peace and not to go on

a protracted trial investigating title when deciding the matter in dispute.

That is the very reason that the Legislature in its wisdom made provisions providing a time

frame of three months to conclude matters before the Primary Court Judge and while no

Page 7 of 8

right of appeal is provided. Thus, it is apparent that the Legislature intended to discourage

people from filing appeals and applications on frivolous and meritless grounds.

It is observable that the information pertaining to the instant application under Section 66

of the Primary Courts Procedure Act was filed on 18.02.1996 and the matter was settled

between the parties when the learned Primary Court Judge concluded the matter on

27.05.1998. Thus, it appears that 26 years have passed since the institution of the instant

action without having the final adjudication of the civil rights of parties decided by a

competent Court.

The learned High Court Judge has set aside the Orders made by his predecessor on

27.05.1998 and 17.02.1999 on the settlement entered upon the Appellant and the

Respondents, in view of the Superior Courts Judgments cited, Peoples Bank Vs. Gilbert

Weerasinghe [1986] 2 CALR 260 and Nandawathi Vs. Jayathilake [2005] 3 SLR 230.

It is seen that the learned High Court Judge had specifically mentioned in his judgment

dated 05.05.2015 that;

66 ,

[ ]

.

It is relevant to note that the land in dispute is a reservation land belonging to the state.

Originally, the father of 1st Party 2nd Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent [H.H. Githawathie

Violet] and 2nd Party 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Appellant [Hewa Heenpallage Wasanthi

Kumari] were in possession of the land and the dispute between the parties has arisen after

the fathers demise.

Since the land is a state land, it is appropriate for the learned Primary Court Judge to

direct the parties to enter into a settlement. As such, it clearly manifests that the learned

High Court Judge had considered all the relevant facts and Law and set aside the Order

Page 8 of 8

made by his predecessor and directed the parties to resolve their dispute and obtain license

according to their entitlement from the divisional secretary.

Hence, we see no reason for us to interfere with the Order dated 05.05.2015 of the learned

High Court Judge of Ampara.

Therefore, we dismiss this appeal. Parties have to bear their own cost of litigation in the

Primary Court, Provincial High Court and also in this Court.

Appeal is dismissed.
