Argued on: 02.11.2021.

Written Submissions on: 22.12.2021 (by the Petitioner).

09.12.2021 (by the 1st, 2A, 3rd, 4A, 5A, 6A,

7A, 9th, 11th, and 12th Respondents).

Decided on: 19.01.2022.

MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioner by her petition dated 21.03.2019, seeking, inter alia, the

following reliefs:

(c) a writ of certiorari quashing the appointment of the 12th Respondent as the Assistant Director (Personal) of the 1st Respondent. (d) a writ of mandamus directing the 1st to 7th Respondents to formulate and obtain the approval of the 14th Respondent for the Scheme of Recruitment, relevant for the post of Assistant Director (Personal). (e) a writ of mandamus directing the 1st to 7th Respondents to advertise and call for applications for the post of Assistant Director (Personal), afresh, in accordance with a Scheme of Recruitment approved by the 12th Respondent.

The Petitioner states that she was appointed as a Translator of the 1st

Respondent, Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (sometimes referred

to as the SLBC), by the letter dated 30.12.2004, pursuant to a

competitive examination and interview held by the SLBC. The

Petitioner states that she had to resign the post temporarily due to a

foreign training in Japan for a period of 6 months. She further states

that after returning to Sri Lanka upon concluding the said training,

she was re-appointed to the same post by the letter dated 30.09.2005

with effect from 01.10.2005.

Page 7 of 15

The Petitioner states that on 10.04.2018, the 3rd Respondent issued a

staff notice (marked as P15), calling for the applications for the posts

of Assistant Director (Personal) and Assistant Director

(Establishment). Since she was interested in the post of Assistant

Director (Personal) she applied for the said post by the application

dated 20.04.2018 (marked as P16). The interviews for the above posts

were held on 14.06.2018 and the Petitioner faced the interview for the

applied post i.e., Assistant Director (Personal) on the said date. The

Petitioner further states that all the applicants were interviewed on the

same day by the interview panel consisting of the 8th to 11th

Respondents.

The Petitioner states that the interview panel went through her

personal file and the certificates at the said interview. She also states

that prior to the interview, the applicants were not informed any

appropriate marking criteria.

The Petitioner states that although the interviews were held on

14.06.2018, no appointments were made for a considerable period of

time. The Petitioner further states that, however, there were rumours

that the 12th Respondent has been selected for the post of Assistant

Director (Personal). In the circumstances, the Petitioner submitted a

request dated 07.08.2018 under the Right to Information Act, No. 12

of 2016, requesting for the marks sheets of the interview held on

14.06.2018 (vide documents marked P17 and P18). Thereafter, in

response to the said request, she was furnished with the composite

marks sheet of the interviews for the above said posts held on

14.06.2018 (vide documents marked P19 and P20).

Refer to the marking sheet P20 (vide page 2), the Petitioner, states that

the interview panel had made a note stating that they take

responsibility only for the marks but not to the procedure as there is

no approved Scheme of Recruitment. Therefore, the Petitioner takes

up the position that when the interviews were held for said posts, even

Page 8 of 15

the interview panel has not been aware of the approved Scheme of

Recruitment. The Petitioner further states that on the face of the said

marking sheets, it is evident that there are anomalies and

irregularities regarding the marks given at the interview.

It was the contention of the Petitioner, that the 14th Respondent,

Department of Management Services has issued the Management

Services Circular No. 03/2018 dated 18.07.2018 [vide documents

marked P21 and P21(a)], which specified that the public sector

institutions should refrain from recruiting employees without

obtaining prior approval of the Department of Management Services.

The Petitioner further states that on 07.02.2019, she a clarification

under the Right to Information Act to the Department of Management

Services whether there is an approved Scheme of Recruitment.

Accordingly, by a letter dated 14.02.2019 (marked P23), the Petitioner

was informed by the Department of Management Services that the

SLBC has not obtained approval of the Department for a Scheme of

Recruitment.

The Petitioner states that surprisingly on or about 26.01.2019, she

became aware that the 12th Respondent had been appointed to the

said post i.e., Assistant Director (Personal) on permanent basis by the

1st Respondent, by its Board Decision No. 12.24 dated 14.12.2018

(vide document marked R13).

The Petitioner states that in the totality of the aforesaid

circumstances, the appointment of the 12th Respondent as the

Assistant Director (Personal) of the 1st Respondent, SLBC is ultra vires

and illegal, inter alia, for the following reasons:

a) applications have been called by the notice P15 issued by the 1st

Respondent without an approved Scheme of Recruitment.

Page 9 of 15

b) The evaluation of the qualifications of the Petitioner and other

applicants by the 8th to 11th Respondents is irrational and

unreasonable.

c) In view of the letter P23, the Department of Management

Services has not approved Scheme of Recruitment of the SLBC.

d) The entire selection process is a sham and has been for the

ulterior purpose of appointing the 12th Respondent for the post

of Assistant Director (Personal).

e) The powers of the 1st Respondent to make appointments to its

staff are conferred under section 19(4) of the Sri Lanka

Broadcasting Corporation Act, No. 37 of 1966 and in the

aforesaid circumstances the appointment of the 12th

Respondent amounts to an abuse of statutory power.

(Vide para 29-30 of the petition)

The 1st, 2A, 3rd, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A, 9th, 11th, and 12th Respondents in their

statements of objection dated 30.08.2019 submitted that, initially, in

the year of 2013, the Department of Management Services approved

the cadre of 19 Assistant Directors [including the two post of Assistant

Director (Personal) and Assistant Director (Establishment)] in the 1st

Respondent Corporation. However, in 2018, as the above two posts fell

vacant, there was an urgency to fill the said vacancies to avoid

financial loss and Administrative breakdown in the Corporation.

Thereby, on 14.02.2018, the Board Members of the 1st Respondent by

R13, decided to recruit an Assistant Director (Personal) and an

Assistant Director (Establishment) immediately to fill the said

vacancies following the existing Scheme of Recruitment of the 1st

Respondent. Accordingly, the 3rd Respondent issued a staff notice on

10.04.2018 calling for applications for the above posts.

Page 10 of 15

The 1st, 2A, 3rd, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A, 9th, 11th, and 12th Respondents further

submitted that at the interview, the 12th Respondent scored the

highest marks of 56 for the post of Assistant Director (Personal)

whereas the Petitioner only scored 35 marks (vide P19). Accordingly,

the Board decided to appoint the candidate who scored the highest

marks i.e., the 12th Respondent to cover up duties of the said post by

letter dated 13.08.2018. It is to be noted that thereafter, on

27.08.2018 the 1st Respondent SLBC obtained an approval from the

Department of Management Services to the said vacancy [vide

documents marked R8 and R15(h)] and accordingly, the 12th

Respondent was made permanent to the post of Assistant Director

(Personal) as per the Board Decision dated 14.12.2018.

The 1st, 2A, 3rd, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A, 9th, 11th, and 12th Respondents, by

appending documents marked R16-R20, further submitted that the

reasons for the delay in obtaining an approved Scheme of Recruitment

is due to the continues change of the cadre that occurred mainly due

to the Trade Union disagreements and protest. Therefore, the

Respondents argued that the non-availability of an approved Scheme

of Recruitment does not make the recruitment of the 12th Respondent

illegal to the said post on the basis of Equity.

This Court is mindful of the fact that, preparing a Scheme of

Recruitment is an important segment in the process of recruiting

public servants under Chapter II of the Establishments Code. Our

Courts have consistently recognized that the provisions of the

Establishments Code should be complied with and given effect to. That

approach stems from early decisions such as Perera v.

Jayawickreme [1985] 1 Sri LR 285, where Wanasundera, J. at page

328 described the Establishments Code as the basic enactment

governing the matters set out therein and as an authoritative

enactment issued by the Cabinet of Ministers which has been designed

to apply to all classes and categories of public officers falling under

Article 55 of the Constitution.

Page 11 of 15

As precisely observed by Amerasinghe, J. in Pereira and 9 Others v.

Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and 22 Others

[1994] 1 Sri LR 152, a Scheme of Recruitment should be prepared

in order to recruit persons replete with most appropriate knowledge,

skills and attitudes to the respective positions in a transparent

manner with a view to efficiently maintaining the public service with

high productivity providing equal opportunities to all those who fulfill

required qualifications. The announcement of the way in which the

eventual selection will be made will serve as an assurance that the

selection process is not a false, outward show, but an honest attempt

to select the best person for the post, for those who wish to apply might

be reasonably expected to do so only if they feel confident that there is

a genuine search for the fittest person and not a masquerade resulting

in a waste of time and effort.

In the case in hand, the main contention of the learned Counsel for

the Petitioner is to the effect, that the appointment of the 12th

Respondent as the Assistant Director (Personal) of the 1st Respondent,

SLBC is ultra vires and illegal for the reason that applications have

been called by the notice P15 without an approved Scheme of

Recruitment. This position is not disputed by the Respondents.

However, the learned Counsel for the Respondents argued that at the

interview, the 12th Respondent scored the highest marks of 56 for the

post of Assistant Director (Personal) whereas the Petitioner only scored

35 marks. Accordingly, the SLBC Board decided to appoint the 12th

Respondent who scored the highest marks to cover up the duties of

the said post by letter dated 13.08.2018. Thereafter, on 27.08.2018,

the 1st Respondent SLBC obtained an approval from the Department

of Management Services to the said vacancy and accordingly, the 12th

Respondent was made permanent to the post of Assistant Director

(Personal) as per the Board Decision dated 14.12.2018. The learned

Counsel for the Respondents submitted that the reasons for the delay

in obtaining an approved Scheme of Recruitment, is due to the

Page 12 of 15

continues change of the cadre that occurred mainly due to the Trade

Union disagreements and protest. Therefore, the learned Counsel took

up the position that the non-availability of an approved Scheme of

Recruitment does not make the recruitment of the 12th Respondent

illegal to the said post on the basis of equity.

To my mind, the reasons alluded by the Respondents are satisfactory.

Professor Wade in his monumental work Administrative Law

(Tenth Edition), at page 352, emphasizes that, the courts

constantly accuse them of bad faith merely because they have acted

unreasonably or on improper grounds. Again and again it is laid down

that powers must be exercised reasonably and in good faith. But in this

context in good faith means merely for legitimate reasons. Contrary

to the natural sense of the words, they impute no moral obliquity.

In Roberts v. Hopwood [1925] AC 578 Lord Wrenbury, at page 613

observed that,

A person in whom is vested a discretion must exercise his

discretion upon reasonable grounds. A discretion does not

empower a man to do what he likes merely because he is minded

to do so he must in the exercise of his discretion do not what he

likes but what he ought. In other words, he must, by use of his

reason, ascertain and follow the course which reason directs. He

must act reasonably.

Further, in my view, the decisions of the 1st Respondents Board to

appoint the 12th Respondent (the candidate who scored the highest

marks) to cover up duties of the said post and the subsequent approval

from the Department of Management Services are satisfy the

proportionality standard.

The principle of proportionality envisages that public authorities ought

to maintain a sense of proportion between their particular goals and

Page 13 of 15

the means they employ to achieve those goals, so that his action

impinges on the individual rights to the minimum extent to preserve

the public interest [vide Council of Civil Services Unions v. Minister

for the Civil Services [1984] UKHL 9 - per Lord Diplock]. By

proportionality, we also mean the question whether, while regulating

exercise of individuals rights, the appropriate or least-restrictive

choice of measures has been made by the legislature or the

administrator so as to achieve the object of the legislation or the

purpose of the administrative order, as the case maybe. Under this

principle, the court will see that the legislature or the administrative

authority maintain a proper balance between the adverse effects

which the legislation or the administrative order may have on the rights,

liberties or interests of persons keeping in mind the purpose which they

were intended to serve. The legislature and the administrative

authority are, however, given an area of discretion or a range of choices

but as to whether the choice made infringes the rights excessively or

not is for the court [vide Om Kumar v. Union of India (2001)

2 SCC 386, at para 28].

Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of this case, I cannot bring

myself to conclude that the decision of the 1st Respondent to recruit

the 12th Respondent to the said post is patently unreasonable or

perverse.

The Petitioner principally, sought to quash the appointment of the 12th

Respondent as the Assistant Director (Personal) of the 1st Respondent.

The Petitioner also sought writs of mandamus directing the 1st to 7th

Respondents to formulate and obtain the approval of the 14th

Respondent for the Scheme of Recruitment, relevant for the post of

Assistant Director (Personal) and directing the 1st to 7th Respondents

to advertise and call for applications for the post of Assistant Director

(Personal), afresh, in accordance with a Scheme of Recruitment

approved by the 14th Respondent. In my view, if the instant application

is allowed, a serious injustice would be caused to the 12th Respondent

Page 14 of 15

who has had a legitimate expectation to be appointed to the said post

of Assistant Director (Personal) upon receiving the highest marks at

the interview. The Court will have regard to the special circumstances

of the case before it, prior to issue a writ of certiorari. A writ of certiorari

clearly will not issue where the result will be futility, frustration,

injustice, and illegality (vide Siddeek v. Jacolyn Seneviratne and 3

Others [1984] 2 Sri LR 83).

Let me add one thing. Judicial review of administrative actions is the

most potent weapon in the hands of the judiciary for the maintenance

of the Rule of Law. The key, in the context of administrative law, lies

in the exercise of an appropriate degree of restraint by the courts in

the intensity of their scrutiny of the decision in question. In some

instances, the supervisory intervention of this Court may create

unnecessary dire consequences or administrative inconveniences. The

rules and procedures under which the courts perform this supervisory

function should not interfere with good administration to any greater

extent than is necessary.

Hence, I must state that prerogative writs will not be issued as a

matter of routine, as a matter of course or as a matter of right. It is

purely a discretionary remedy to be granted or denied in the unique

facts and circumstances of each individual case (vide P. S. Bus Co.,

Ltd. v. Members and Secretary of Ceylon Transport Board [1958]

61 NLR 491). Even if the party applying the writ is entitled to that

relief, still it can be denied if the other factors stand against granting

of that relief. Other factors will include matters of common benefit as

opposed to individual benefit. Vide Jayaweera v. Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarian Services, Ratnapura [1996] 2 Sri LR

70; Siddeek v. Jacolyn Seneviratne (supra); Selvamani v. Dr.

Kumaravelupillai [2005] 2 Sri LR 99 and Edirisooriya v. National

Salaries and Carde Commission [2011] 2 Sri LR 221.

For the aforesaid reasons, I proceed to dismiss this application.

Page 15 of 15

Accordingly, this application is dismissed without costs.

Application dismissed.
