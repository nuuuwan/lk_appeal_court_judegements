Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner was elected a member of the Horowpathana Pradeshiya Sabha (Pradeshiya

Sabha) consequent to the Local Government Elections held in February 2019 and he was

elected as the Chairman of the Council at its first meeting. The Petitioner was required to

submit a budget for the succeeding year i.e., year 2022 (budget), in terms of the Pradeshiya

Sabhas Act No. 15 of 1987, as amended (the Act). The issues emanating in this application

revolves around the said budget.

Facts in this case are very much similar to the case of Kahatagasdigiliya Pradeshiya Sabha

bearing no. CA/Writ/31/2022 in which the Governor of the North Central Province had

declared that the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha is considered to resign from the post of

Chiarman due to failure to pass the budget prepared by the said Chairman.

The learned Counsel who represented several Respondents in this case taking the same

arguments as in other connected cases contended that the questions relating to this application

have already been resolved by His Lordship Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere with the agreement

of the His Lordship Justice Mayadunne Corea in four separate cases of this Court. i.e.,

CA/Writ/24/2021, CA/Writ/51/2021, CA/Writ/57/2021 and CA/Writ/61/2021.

Accordingly, the relevant Respondents moved that this application be dismissed in limine.

In the circumstances, in this case also, it is necessary to ascertain whether the Petitioner has

submitted a case which is suitable for full investigation and a hearing after issuing notice on

all the Respondents. In the backdrop of the above orders made by this Court and upon the

circumstances, the Court should be satisfied that there is a prima facie case that ought to be

resolved after full argument.

The Petitioner in this application on 29.11.2021 tabled the draft budget for the year 2022

incorporating the proposals of the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha (Members) who

requested a vote regarding the discussion of the draft budget. The motion to discuss the budget

has been defeated and consequently the Petitioner has requested the Members to submit

amendments or modifications to the draft budget. Meantime, the Petitioner has been

informed, by virtue of letter marked P14 (dated 13.12.2021), by the 4th Respondent inter alia

to comply and take steps in compliance with the order in the case bearing No.

CA/Writ/61/2021 of this Court. Thereafter the budget was submitted on 16.12.2021 and 8

members including the Chairman expressed views in favour of the budget and 10 members

expressed views against the budget. Significantly no vote has been taken on the budget on that

day. Subsequently, the Petitioner without even re-submitting the budget informed the 4th

Respondent that the budget prepared by him has been duly adopted on 16.12.2021 on the

alleged basis that there were no amendments made to the budget.

The 1st Respondent based on such circumstances has issued the Gazette Notification No.

2263/7 dated 19.01.2022 marked P18 declaring that the Petitioner is considered to have

resigned from the post of Chairman with effect from 31.12.2021 and the post of Chairman is

considered to be vacant since that date due to failure to pass the budget prepared by the

Petitioner in terms of section 168 & 169 of the Act and also on non-compliance with the said

section 169.

The budget which was submitted to Council on 16.12.2021 by the Petitioner was for the year

2022 and that was for a period after two years since the commencement of the term of office

of the Horowpathana Pradeshiya Sabha. The initial question which arises in this application

also is whether the Petitioner is entitled to have the benefit of the deeming provision in the

first portion of the section 169 of the Act even after two years from the commencement of the

term of office of the Council. The other question which arises is whether the Petitioner is

entitled to any concessions under section 169 of the Act in an event he has failed to submit

the budget for a vote at the first submission and even failed to re-submit.

I have already dealt with and determined similar questions relating to this application in;

Page 6 of 8

a) Madampage Nanda Wijeratne Silva vs. Marshal of the Airforce Roshan

Goonetileke Governor-Western Province & others (CA/Writ/649/2021, decided

on 28.02.2022)

b) Kasudeen Mohomed Nihar vs. Anuradha Yahampath Governor- Eastern Province

& others (CA/Writ/12/2022, decided on 28.02.2022) c) J. Thilekeratne vs. Hon. M. Herath,Governor-North Central Province & others

(CA/Writ/31/2022, decided on 28.02.2022)

I have extensively considered the submissions made on behalf of the Petitioner as well as the

submissions on behalf of the Respondents which are identical to the view point taken by the

learned Counsel for the Respondents in all above three cases. I hold that the reasoning given

by me to arrive at the conclusion in above three cases are applicable in relation to the questions

in the instant application also.

My findings in the above three cases were mainly based on the precedent established by His

Lordship Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere with agreement of His Lordship Justice Mayadunne

Corea in the below mentioned cases;

a) Wellawattage Sarath Peiris vs. Katunayake Seeduwa Urban Council, Seeduwa &

others (CA/Writ/24/2021, decided on 10.06.2021),

b) Manodara Aacharige Chaminda Sugath, Chairman vs. Anuradha Yahampath,

Governor, Eastern Province & others (CA/Writ/51/2021, decided on 10.06.2021).

c) H.M. Lalantha Sumith Seneviratne vs. Pradeshiya Sabhawa of Padiyathalawa &

others (CA/Writ/57/2021, decided on 10.06.2021)

d) A.P. Ranasinghe Bandara, Chairman vs. Anuradha Yahampath, Governor of

Eastern Province & others (CA/Writ/61/2021, decided on 10.06.2021).

In my order in CA/Writ/31/2021, I have summarized the precedent in the above four cases

as follows;

i. In terms of section 168 (2) of the Act, the budget shall be passed by the Council.

ii. However, in terms of section 169 of the Act, the budget submitted by the Chairman

during the first two years of the Council shall be considered as the duly adopted budget,

Page 7 of 8

by operation of law, even though the said budget has not been passed by a majority

vote. Moreover, taking a vote even during the first two years is essential.

iii. After the first two years of the Council, the budget at the first submission or at the re-

submission should be passed by majority votes of the Council.

iv. It is a mandatory duty of the Chairman to submit the annual budget and if the budget

is defeated at the first submission, the chairman must re-submit the budget, for a vote

by the Members of the Council.

v. In the event the budget is defeated any time after the first two years and as a result, if

the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha;

a) fails to re-submit the budget and/or

b) fails to get it passed upon re-submission to the Council,

the relevant Chairman is deemed to have vacated his post in terms of the proviso to

section 169.

vi. Even if the Chairman accepts the amendments, modifications, additions to the budget

or to the supplementary budget, the Chairman is subjected to above cardinal

requirements.

Additionally, it is important to reiterate the following passage in my order dated 28.02.2022

in CA/Writ/31/2022;

Moreover, the rationale of the decision of the Court in all the above cases in addition to the

provision of the said sections 168 & 169 is based on section 14 (1) of the Act. I also have observed

in my order in CA Writ 649/2021, the deeming provisions of section 169 of the Act should be

carefully interpreted in line with the basic principles of Democracy and Good Governance without

undermining the consent or the division of the Members of the Pradeshiya Sabha.

The Petitioner has prayed for in the prayer of the Petition inter alia for a mandate in the nature

of a writ of Certiorari quashing the Gazette Notification bearing No. 2263/7 dated 19.01.2022

marked P18 issued by the 1st Respondent and the letter dated 20.01.2022 marked P19 issued

as a consequent to P18 by the 4th Respondent.

On a careful consideration of the whole matter and in light of the reasoning given in my above

orders (CA/Writ/649/2021, CA/Writ/12/2022 and CA/Writ/31/2022) and in view of the

legal analysis established in the cases bearing Nos. CA Writ/24/2021, CA/Writ/51/2021,

CA/Writ/57/2021 and CA/Writ/61/2021, I take the view that the 1st Respondent Governor

has given due effect to the provisions of sections 14, 168 and 169 of the Act and lawfully

decided that the Petitioner has deemed to have resigned from the office of Chairman.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the questions raised by the Petitioner in the instant

application have already been resolved in the above orders of this Court. Therefore, based on

the arguability principles that should be adopted in respect of matters relating to issuance of

notice in a juridical review application, I arrive at the conclusion that there is no arguable case

or a prima facie case for this Court to issue formal notice on the Respondents in this

application. Therefore, I refuse this application.
