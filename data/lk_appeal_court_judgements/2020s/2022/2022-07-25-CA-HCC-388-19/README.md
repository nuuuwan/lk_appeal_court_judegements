The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Rathnapura

for committing an offence on or about 24.09.2014 punishable under

Section 364(1) of the Penal Code. After the trial, the learned High Court

Judge convicted and sentenced the appellant. This is an appeal against

the said conviction and sentence.

The facts of the case may be briefly summarized as follows:

The prosecutrix had known the accused-appellant since she was a

child. The prosecutrix admitted that she had an affair with the

accused-appellant prior to her marriage. The affair had to be stopped

because her parents refused to consent. The accused-appellant was

living with the prosecutrix's cousin at the time of the incident. The

3

prosecutrix stated that the accused-appellant was a frequent visitor to

her home. However, she said that even after her marriage, other

villagers also came to her house to chew beetle or drink tea. After

derogatory posters ( ) were pasted throughout the village, she

asked everyone, including the accused-appellant, not to come to her

house while her husband is not at home.

The victim was 35 years old at the time of the incident. On the day in

question, the accused, dressed in a sarong and a shirt, arrived in front

of her house carrying a knife between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., while the

prosecutrix was alone at home. He asked for water, and when she told

him to get it from the tap in the back, the appellant went to the back

of the prosecutrix's house, entered through the kitchen door, and went

to the sitting room. The appellant then dragged her to a room and

raped her on the floor.

Written submissions on behalf of both parties have been filed prior to

the hearing. At the hearing, the learned Presidents Counsel for the

appellant and the learned Additional Solicitor General for the

respondent made oral submissions.

Although the written submissions were filed in respect of several

matters, the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant confined his

arguments to two grounds. The first ground is that the learned High

Court Judge has not properly considered the issue of lack of consent.

The position taken up in the appeal was that the sexual intercourse

was taken place with the consent of PW1. The second ground is that

the sentence is grossly excessive.

The sexual intercourse between the prosecutrix (PW1) and the

appellant is clearly admitted by the appellant, according to the first

4

ground of appeal. In substantiating the appellants position, the

learned President's Counsel pointed out that the first person she met

after the incident was PW2, Sunny Wickramanayake. She told him she

had thrown acid on Kumara but not that he had raped her. The learned

President's Counsel went on to say that the first person she told about

the rape was her husband, but he was never called as a witness or

even listed as a witness. Accordingly, the learned President's Counsel

asserted that no rape occurred.

Furthermore, the learned President's Counsel pointed out that,

according to her neighbor, PW2, the appellant meets her three or four

times a week. The learned Presidents Counsel added that although the

prosecutrix was dragged to a room and raped, she did not scream or

flee. Not only that, after the act, the learned Presidents Counsel

submitted that they have spoken about some other matters. Therefore,

he contended that the appellant had not raped her but she wanted to

end her relationship with the appellant.

Undisputedly, the issue of whether the sexual intercourse took place

with or without the consent of the PW1 is a question of fact. The

learned Additional Solicitor General contended that the findings of the

trial Judge in respect of facts should not be lightly disturbed by the

Appellate Court. Considering the several decisions of House of Lords,

Privy Council, and our Apex Courts, it was decided in De Silva and

Others V. Seneviratne and Another (1981) 2 Sri L.R. 7 that Where

the findings on questions of fact are based upon the credibility of

witnesses on the footing of the Trial Judge's perception of such

evidence, then such findings are entitled to great weight and the

utmost consideration and will be reversed only if it appears to the

Appellate Court that the trial Judge has failed to make full use of his

advantage of seeing and listening to the witnesses and the Appellate

Court is convinced by the plainest considerations that it would be

5

justified in doing so. Also, in the cases of King V. Gunaratne 14

Ceylon Law Recorder 174, Fradd V. Brown & Company 20 NLR 282

at 283, Oliver Dayananda Kalansuriya alias Raja V. Republic of Sri

Lanka CA 28/2009, decided on 13.02.2013, it was held that the

testimonial trustworthiness of witnesses is a matter for a trial Judge

and a considered findings of the trial Judge will not be disturbed by

an Appellate Court lightly.

Further, the learned Additional Solicitor General contended that

different people behave differently in situations like this. So, the fact

that she did not yell does not imply that the sexual intercourse was

done with her consent. I agree with the learned Additional Solicitor

General's argument that it is unreasonable and incorrect to expect all

women who have been raped to shout and if not, to determine that

sexual intercourse took place with the consent of that woman. Apart

from that, when PW1 was asked why she did not shout she said

.

. .

.

. (Page 109 of the appeal

brief). Her explanation could be believed as she knew the appellant

very well from her childhood. In addition, she also stated that

, , . (Page 57

of the appeal brief). This is the behaviour of the prosecutrix in this

case. Some other woman would react in some other way. Hence, there

is no reasonable doubt as to whether PW1 had consented for the sexual

intercourse for the reason of not shouting at the time of the incident.

The other points raised by the learned President's Counsel that the

incident of rape was not informed to PW2, her husband was not called

in evidence, and she spoke with the appellant after the incident, are

correct. However, as submitted by the learned Additional Solicitor

6

General, the PW1's behavior may differ from that of a woman raped by

a total stranger because the appellant was a person who frequently

visited PW1's home.

As contended by the learned President's Counsel, there could be some

sort of connection between the PW1 and the appellant. Even though

they had sexual intercourse previously with each others consent, it is

immaterial in this case. The issue in this case is whether the appellant

had sexual intercourse with PW1 without her consent on the day

specified in the charge. Since the appellant asserted that he had sexual

intercourse with PW1 with her consent, the only issue to be resolved

is whether the sexual intercourse occurred with or without PW1's

consent.

It should be noted that when the PW1 testified that the appellant had

sexual intercourse without her consent on the day in question, no

single question was asked in cross-examination to infer that sexual

intercourse occurred with the consent of the PW1. At least, no single

suggestion has been made on behalf of the appellant that sexual

intercourse occurred with the consent of the PW1. The learned

President's Counsel also admitted that the PW1's evidence of lack of

consent was never challenged.

However, the learned President's Counsel for the appellant contended

that irrespective of the defense version, the prosecution must prove

beyond reasonable doubt that the sexual intercourse occurred without

PW1's consent, as the lack of consent is an ingredient of the charge of

rape.

I agree with the contention that the ingredients of the charge have to

be proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution disregarding

the defence version. As decided in Kamal Addaraarachchi V. State

(2000) 3 Sri L. R. 393 that it is a grave error for a trial Judge to direct

7

himself that he must examine the tenability and truthfulness of the

evidence of the accused in the light of the evidence led by the

prosecution. However, in the instant action, no such wrong evaluation

has been made.

In this case, disregarding the dock statement or the defence version

for a moment, the appellant never challenged the PW1's evidence that

sexual intercourse occurred without her consent. The Indian judgment

of Sarvan Singh v. State of Punjab (2002 AIR SC (iii) 3652) pages 3655

and 3656, was cited in the case of Ratnayake Mudiyanselage

Premachandra v. The Hon. Attorney General C.A Case No. 79/2011,

decided on 04.04.2017 as follows:

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined

to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross-examination,

it must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be

accepted.

In the case of Himachal Pradesh v. Thakur Dass (1983) 2 Cri. L. J.

1694 at 1701 V.D Misra CJ held that whenever a statement of fact

made by a witness is not challenged in cross-examination, it has to be

concluded that the fact in question is not disputed. Similarly, in Motilal

v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1990) Criminal Law Journal NOC 125 MP

it was held that Absence of cross-examination of prosecution witness

of certain facts, leads to inference of admission of that fact.

For the reason of not challenging the PW1s evidence regarding the lack

of consent by the appellant, it has to be inferred that the defence has

admitted the lack of consent according to the decisions of the aforesaid

judicial authorities.

In addition, although the appellant made a general statement in his

dock statement that everything happened with the consent of both of

us, when speaking about this particular day in question, he said when

8

I finished chewing the betel nut, she threw away acid that was in a jug.

Accordingly, the appellants dock statement was a total denial. He did

not speak about sexual intercourse with consent. Therefore, this is not

an instance where the Judgment was entered in favour of the

prosecution considering the weakness of the defence version. In any

case, it should be noted that the learned President's Counsel did not

challenge the decision of the learned High Court Judge to reject the

defense version. His contention was that the learned High Court Judge

had not carefully considered the lack of consent. However, it appears

that the lack of consent has not been established in this case for the

reasons stated above.

In addition, there is unchallenged evidence from a retired officer in

charge of the Rathnapura Child and Women Bureau that the frock that

PW1 was wearing at the time of the incident was handed over to her

and the waist area was torn. The frock has most probably been torn

off as a result of her resistance. This is also proof that the sexual

intercourse was done without the consent of PW1.

Furthermore, it is clear from the patient's history in the medico-legal

report marked P3 that PW1 told the doctor the same story he told in

court. She was examined by a doctor on the same day as the incident

occurred. The doctor who prepared the medico-legal report testified in

court and stated that the injuries he examined were consistent with

her history. The doctor has expressed his expert opinion with

reasoning and stated that the sexual intercourse occurred without the

consent of the PW1. In addition, the complaint about this incident has

been made without any delay. All of these facts strengthen the

prosecution case.

To summarize the reasons stated above, the appellant admitted sexual

intercourse in appeal and took up the defence of consent. The

appellant, on the other hand, has never challenged the PW1's evidence

9

of lack of consent. The lack of consent has been corroborated by the

doctor's expert opinion. The appellant did not raise the defence of lack

of consent in the High Court. Due to the position taken in the appeal,

the defence of total denial taken up in the High Court would completely

fail. For these reasons, and for the reasons stated in the Judgment of

the learned High Court Judge, I hold that the conviction is correct in

law.

Now, I proceed to consider the second ground of appeal. The learned

counsel for the appellant contended that the sentence is excessive

because PW1 threw acid on the appellant and the said case against

the PW1 was settled with the understanding that this case would also

be settled. The learned Additional Solicitor General objected to the

sentence being reduced, stating the gravity of the offence.

The learned High Court Judge imposed 15 years of rigorous

imprisonment, a fine of Rs.25000/- and Rs.200,000/- as

compensation. There had been no previous convictions for the

accused-appellant. It is correct that the charge of rape is not

compoundable. However, with or without knowing the nature of the

charge, it transpires from the evidence that PW1 was acquitted from

the case of throwing acid on the understanding that the case against

the appellant for rape would not be pursued. The following is PW1s

evidence regarding this agreement which appears on pages 115 and

116:

According to her own admission of the PW1, she was guilty of the

offence of throwing acid at the appellant. Because of the agreement

between her and the appellant, she was acquitted from the said case

and as a result of the said agreement, she did not get any punishment.

Therefore, the said agreement must necessarily be a reason to reduce

the sentence of the appellant in this case, although this rape case

cannot be settled. The learned High Court Judge has not considered

the said aspect in sentencing.

No doubt that any kind of rape is a grave crime. However, when PW1s

evidence is considered, the nature of rape does not seem so brutal

because according to PW1, the appellant stayed at her home after the

incident, he requested beetle to chew and water to drink from her,

exchanged some words with her, and thereafter she threw acid on him.

Rape is an offence punishable by a minimum of seven years'

imprisonment and a maximum of twenty years' imprisonment. The

sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge is 8 years longer

than the minimum sentence and only 5 years less than the maximum

sentence. Considering the aforesaid circumstances, I hold that 13

years rigorous imprisonment is sufficient for the offence. Therefore, 15

years imprisonment is set aside and the accused-appellant is

sentenced to 13 years rigorous imprisonment. Considering the fact,

that the appellant was in incarceration from the date of the sentence

imposed by the learned High Court Judge, I direct that the term of 13

years imprisonment to have commenced from the date of conviction,

namely 20.11.2019. The fine, compensation and default sentences

imposed by the learned High Court Judge remain unchanged.

11

The appeal is partly allowed only with regard to the sentence.
