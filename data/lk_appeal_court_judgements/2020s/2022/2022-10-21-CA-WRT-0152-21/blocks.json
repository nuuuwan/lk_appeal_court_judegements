    "text": "Judicial review must be distinguished from an appeal against a decision. The court and tribunal structure provides a more or less rational appeal structure for those aggrieved by a judicial decision. The appellate court will have the power to reconsider the case and to substitute its own decision for that of the lower court. An appeal may be made on both the law and the facts of the case, so full re-hearing may take place. judicial review, by contrast, is concerned solely with the manner in which the decision maker has applied relevant rules: it is thus procedural in nature. It is not for the court-in judicial review proceedings- to substitute its judgement for that of the decision-making body to which powers have been delegated but, rather, to ensure that the adjudicator has kept within the rules laid down by statute and the common law. In short, the role of the courts in judicial review is to exercise a supervisory, not an appellate, jurisdiction. judicial review is not an appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner in which the decision was made.1[constitutional &Administrative law by Hilaire Barnett (ninth edition) page 550.",

Therefore, I am of the view that it is not the duty of this court to analyse the facts as would be done in an appeal process since this Court is exercising its Writ jurisdiction as opposed to its Appellate Jurisdiction. Furthermore, in the case of Reg. Vs. Lord Chancellor, Ex p. Maxwell (DC) (1997) 1 W.L.R. 104 at 109, the court has observed that those courts (which exercise the jurisdiction of judicial review) are not concerned with the merits of such decisions, but only with the legality of them.",

However, by its decision marked P2, it appears that the Board has failed to make a determination based on the evidence produced by the said witnesses on whether the 1st Respondent has satisfied the Board of his possession of the impugned property as of the date of the application, thus leading to a failure to take into account relevant considerations. Instead of considering the evidence presented by the said two witnesses, the Board has taken into consideration the failure of the Petitioner to give evidence and her inability to satisfy her possession of the impugned property in making the determination. This results in a wholly irrelevant consideration as the burden of proof to satisfy the possession of the property rests with the 1st Respondent as per Section 19(1A) of the Debt Conciliation Board Ordinance. The Board has placed the burden which is owed to the 1st Respondent on the Petitioner. The relevant part of the order of the Board is reproduced as follows,",
