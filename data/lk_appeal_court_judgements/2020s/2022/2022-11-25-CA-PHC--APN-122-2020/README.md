Judgment

It appears that the 1st Party Petitioner has invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of

this Court seeking to revise the Order of the learned High Court Judge of Homagama

dated 18.08.2020 which refused to issue notice in revision application bearing No.

15/2020 and dismissed the application in limine.

On behalf of the Petitioner-Petitioner-Petitioner [hereinafter referred to as the 1st

Party Petitioner], it was submitted that the subject matter of the instant action is

a large area of a land called "Elston Estate", owned and possessed by 25 persons by

title deeds since 1981. The said owners wanted to sell this property and they had

entered into 20 Agreements to Sell with the 1st Party Petitioner. Consequently, the

1st Party Petitioner took steps to clear the said property and develop it for the

Page 5 of 11

purpose of sale in March 2017. However, the 2nd Party Respondents had forcibly

entered the said land and claimed possession. The 1st Party Petitioner had reported

the said dispute to Mulleriyawa Police and the Police filed Case No.1864/10 under

Section 81 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to restrain the 2nd Party

Respondents and to bind them over. However, the said dispute could not be settled

with the 2nd Party Respondents and the 1st Party Petitioner was forcibly dispossessed

on 02.04.2017 from the larger portion of the said land by the 2nd Party Respondents

and by the Intervenient Respondents.

The 1st Party Petitioner had filed information in the Magistrates Court of Kaduwela

under Section 66 (1) (b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 and

prayed to restore the said land back into possession by evicting the 2nd Party

Respondents and other Intervenient Respondents.

The learned Magistrate being satisfied that there was a breach of peace threatened

or likely to be threatened as a result of the said dispute, had issued notices on the

2nd Party Respondents and made an order to affix notices on the land. After affixing

notices, the Intervenient Respondents who claimed possession too were added.

After the 1st Party Petitioner and all the Respondents filed their respective affidavits

together with the documents and counter affidavits, Court had allowed them to file

written submissions.

The learned Magistrate, who was acting as the Primary Court Judge made an Order

on 06.02.2018 dismissing the petition of 1st Party Petitioner on the ground that the

information was filed after a lapse of 2 months as the 1st Party Petitioner has been

forcibly dispossessed on 02.04.2017 and in terms of Section 68 (3), the 1st Party

Petitioner should file the information within 2 months from 02.04.2017. However,

the said information had been filed on 05.06.2017, just after the lapse of 2 months.

Furthermore, the learned Magistrate held that the 2nd Party Respondents and

Intervenient Respondents were in possession of the land in dispute.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the 1st Party Petitioner invoked the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in

Page 6 of 11

Homagama seeking to restrain the Respondents from possessing the 1st Party

Petitioner's entire land as irreparable and irremediable injustice would cause the 1st

Party Petitioner. Thus, prayed for a stay order staying further proceedings of the

Magistrates Court Case No. 3641/17/66. However, the Court issued only notices on

the 1st to 6th Respondents.

Thereafter, the 1st Party Petitioner filed another petition and affidavit on 05.04.2018

before the learned High Court Judge together with the annexures showing wanton

destruction which were caused by the Respondents and moved Court for a stay order.

The learned High Court Judge had disregarded the position taken up by the

Petitioner and made an order varying the order of the learned Magistrate by

advancing the date of dispossession of the 1st Party Petitioner as 03.03.2017 and

dismissed the application of the Petitioner, on the basis that even if the 1st Party

Petitioner has filed information on 31.05.2017 according to the new plaint register,

it is still out of time.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned High Court Judge dated 04.06.2018,

the 1st Party Petitioner had filed a revision application bearing No.CA (PHC) APN

68/18 in the Court of Appeal seeking to revise the said order of the learned High

Court Judge. The Court of Appeal had revised and set aside the order of the learned

High Court Judge dated 04.06.2018 and further ordered the present learned High

Court Judge to hear the 1st Party Petitioners revision application bearing No.

Rev.05/2018. The learned High Court Judge after hearing both parties had made an

order on 29.01.2020 setting aside the order of the learned Magistrate of Kaduwela

dated 06.02.2018 and directing the learned Magistrate to make an order considering

all documents filed by the parties.

Consequently, the learned Magistrate of Kaduwela made an order on 01.06.2020

stating that two months prior to the date of filing the information on 31.05.2017,

the 1st Party Petitioner had not been in possession of the corpus. Further, it was held

that the 2nd Party Respondent and Intervenient Party Respondents were in possession

of the subject matter and hence, had dismissed the 1st Party Petitioners

application.

Page 7 of 11

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned Magistrate dated 01.06.2020, the

1st Party Petitioner had filed revision application bearing No. Rev15/2020 in the High

Court of Homagama seeking to revise the said Order. However, the learned High

Court Judge had made his order on 18.08.2020 dismissing the application of the 1st

Party Petitioner even without issuing notice on the Respondents.

It was submitted on behalf of the 1st Party Petitioner that on 13.08.2020 when the

Counsel for the 1st Party Petitioner moved to support the said application for

revision, the learned High Court Judge vehemently objected to the Counsel

supporting the same and gave the following reasons.

i. The 1st Party Petitioner has not presented an application in terms of

Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act that it was dispossessed

by the Respondents and one Priyadarshani Lankathilaka Kumari had filed

an affidavit but her name did not appear in the caption of the petition and

also that she had merely said that she was Senior Assistant Managing

Director and the affidavit had been filed with her knowledge and perusing

the documents.

ii. In terms of the said affidavit she has pleaded that the 1st Party Petitioner

had been dispossessed by the 1st, 2nd &3rd Respondents and in paragraph

18-20 she has said that there was a breach of peace.

iii. He has also considered the document produced marked "X-57" made by

one John Ganegoda on 05.04.2017 claiming that his possession has been

disturbed by the Respondents by threatening him from entering the said

land and chased him and therefore if there was a breach of peace it was

only for him and not for the 1st Party Petitioner. Therefore, there was no

evidence before the learned Magistrate that the 1st Party Petitioner has

been dispossessed by the Respondents and also there was no evidence of

a dispute between the 1st Party Petitioner and the Respondents in terms

of Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act causing breach of

peace.

iv. He further said that 1st Party Petitioner has fraudulently submitted forged

documents and tried to take over possession and it had not come to court

with clean hands.

Page 8 of 11

v. At that stage, the Counsel for the 1st party Petitioner moved to make

submissions despite the learned High Court Judge's displeasure but made

his submissions and supported his application for notice.

Court draws attention to the Order dated 18.08.2020, which states;

.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned High Court Judge dated 18.08.2020

the 1st Party Petitioner had invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court to have

the said Order revised and/or set aside on the following grounds;

a) The said order is erroneous and contrary to law.

b) All the grounds raised by the learned High Court Judge were not raised by

anyone of the Respondents in the original Court and the learned High Court

Judge in exercise of revisionary jurisdiction cannot raise new grounds in the

exercise of appellate jurisdiction which are all questions of law.

c) It is the same High Court Judge who made order on 29.01.2020 to the learned

Magistrate of Kaduwela to make his order considering all the material placed

before him on its merits and therefore in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction

by way of revision he cannot raise preliminary objection on the information

filed and affidavits, and documents submitted by the parties.

d) The learned High Court Judge who held there was no dispute causing breach

of peace, has held that the order made by the learned Magistrate on

01.06.2020 is just and reasonable when it is settled law that the jurisdiction

to the learned Primary Court Judge to hear an application made under Section

66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act comes only when there is breach of

peace or likelihood and therefore if there is no breach of peace there is no

jurisdiction to the Learned Magistrate to entertain the said application.

e) The learned High Court Judge totally disregarded the submissions made by

the Counsel for the 1st Party Petitioner when he supported the notice on

13.08.2020 and made derogatory remarks to the Counsel erroneously blaming

that he had uttered falsehood in Courts.

Page 9 of 11

Having considered the aforesaid grounds to make this application for revision, it is

seen that the 1st Party Petitioner has substantiated that exceptional circumstances

exist to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court.

It is to be noted that the learned High Court Judge held there was no dispute causing

breach of peace.

It is settled law that the jurisdiction for the learned Primary Court Judge to hear an

application made under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act comes only

when there is breach of peace or a likelihood of it. Therefore, when the High Court

Judge held there is no breach of peace, there is no jurisdiction and the only order

the learned Magistrate could have made was to dismiss the petition for want of

jurisdiction.

It is worthy to note that there was clear and cogent evidence of a breach of peace

and Mulleriyawa Police had filed an information on 07.03.2017 in case bearing No.

1864/17 under Section 81 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

It is evident that the owners of the impugned land had entered into an agreement

to sell the said property with the 1st Party Petitioner and has handed over the

possession to the Petitioner. Thereafter, the Petitioner had employed two security

officers from Ceylinco Security Services to protect the land. On 02.03.2017, the

Respondents had entered the land and started erecting fences.

Subsequently, the Mulleriyawa Police had removed the fence erected by the

Respondents and warned them not to enter the impugned land. However, the

Respondent had entered the impugned land on 02.04.2017 and had started erecting

huts in different areas of the land and dispossessed the Petitioner of the same.

It clearly shows that there was a breach of peace threatened between the 1st Party

Petitioner and the Respondent. Thus, the learned Magistrate who was acting as the

Primary Court Judge had jurisdiction to entertain the information filed in terms of

Section 66 (1) (b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

Since this matter arising out of the Order of the learned Magistrate dealt with an

application under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, it is incumbent

Page 10 of 11

upon the Court to adjudicate in terms of Section 68 (1) and 68 (3) of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act who was in possession of the disputed land two months prior

to the date of filing of information.

It was the finding of the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge that

the 1st Party Petitioner was dispossessed from the premises in dispute on 02.04.2017.

Thus, in terms of Section 68 (3) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, it appears

that the party was forcibly dispossessed within a period of two months immediately

before the date on which the information was filed. The Court draws the attention

to the Order made by the learned High Court Judge on 29.01.2019, where he found

that according to the case register marked and produced as 23(), the

information was filed on 31.05.2017.

It is apparent that since the 1st Party Petitioner was dispossessed on 02.04.2017, and

the information was filed on 31.05.2017, hence the information was filed within a

period of two months prior to the date on which the information was filed.

Therefore, in terms of Section 68 (3) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, I hold

that the 1st Party Petitioner is entitled to be restored to possession of the disputed

land and have all disturbances of such possession prohibited. As such, the learned

Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge had erred in Law by holding against the

1st Party Petitioner.

In view of the foregoing reasons, we are inclined to set aside the Order of the learned

Magistrate dated 06.02.2017 and the Order made by the learned High Court Judge

dated 18.08.2020.

Court observes that the 1st Party Petitioner has prayed in prayer (b) and (c) of the

Petition to revise or set aside the Order of the learned High Court Judge dated

18.08.2020 and to have him directed to hear this application on its merits and to set

aside the Order of the learned Magistrate of Kaduwela dated 06.02.2017 in case No.

3641/17/66 considering the merits of its application.

Page 11 of 11

However, the 1st Party Petitioner has not prayed to restore the possession of the 1st

Party Petitioner, instead, has prayed to send this case to the High Court of the

province to hear the application on its merits.

In this instance, Court submits that Part VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act is

introduced to resolve minor disputes relating to land where the breach of peace is

threatened or likely to be threatened and to adjudicate the matter within a three

months period of time. No right of appeal is conferred by the Primary Courts

Procedure Act against the Order of the Primary Court Judge. Therefore, it is clear

that the intention of the Legislature is to resolve the dispute among the parties

expeditiously to maintain peace and preserve status quo.

Hence, this Court is not inclined to send this case back to the High Court of the

province to re-hear the matter.

Although the 1st Party Petitioner has not sought to reinstate the possession of the 1st

Party Petitioner, we allow this revision application deciding in favour of the 1st Party

Petitioner and we direct the learned Magistrate to issue a writ to restore possession

of the 1st Party Petitioner-Petitioner-Petitioner and evict the 2nd Party Respondent-

Respondent-Respondents and the Intervenient Respondents from the land in dispute

in terms of prayer (f) of the petition of the 1st Party Petitioner.
