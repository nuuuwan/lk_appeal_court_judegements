MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant matter has been filed to set aside the order dated 14.12.2021 of the

High Court of Negambo.

The accused in the instant matter has been taken in to custody on 27.7 2016 for

being in possession of 300 grams of a substance suspected to be heroin. The

accused had been produced before the Magistrate under the provisions of the

Poisons Opium and Dangerous drugs Ordinance.

The Government Analyst Report has been ready on 31.10.2016 and it has

detected 145.94 grams of heroin in the alleged substance taken in to custody

from the suspect.

The accused has been indicted on 18.9.2019 but the trial had not been taken up.

The main contention of the Counsel for the accused was that the long period in

remand without the conclusion of the trial and the leading witness in the instant

matter has been disbelieved in the case of the decoy of this Court in trial before

the High Court.

The Counsel for the respondents vehemently objected to the application on the

basis that the amount which is alleged to have been in the custody of the accused

being very high and the trial being postponed on the last date being due to the

Counsel of the suspect and not the prosecution.

Having considered the submissions of both parties this Court observes that

although the Attorney General has moved to file objections has not done so but

has verbally objecting in Court without bringing to the notice of Court their

failure to abide by the undertaking given to Court.

Be that as it may, in a matter filed under the provisions of the above mentioned

act an accused charged under the said act can be enlarged on bail only upon

exceptional circumstances.

The term exceptional has not been defined in the act, but in many of our cases

decided cases it has been held that exceptionality differs from case to case.

In the instant matter the exceptionality urged is the long period of remand even

after the receipt of the Government Analyst report.

In the case of Attorney General vs. Ediriweera (2006 1 SLR Pg 25) it was held,

Delay is always a relative term and the question to be considered

is not whether there was mere explicable delay, as when there is a backlog of

cases, but whether there has been excessive or oppressive delay and this

always depend on the facts and circumstances of the case..

In the instant matter the accused has been in remand since 2016 up to date

which is now 7 years and still the trial has not commenced and the State

Counsel had objected verbally but has failed to comply with rule 52 of the

Supreme Court rules, which in the event of any violation it is the discretion of

Court to consider the submissions of the respondents as per the case of

Christopher v. Don Paul, [1990] 2SLR L R 54 (CA).

Hence for the reasons stated above this Court sets aside the impugned order of

the High Court and direct the learned High Court Judge to enlarges the accused

namely AnvarJeyalaabdeenImithiyas on suitable conditions of bail upon the

receipt of this Order.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to convey the instant order to the

relevant High Court.
