Judgment

The Officer-in-Charge of Harbour Police Station - Trincomalee had filed an information in terms

of Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 in the Primary Court of

Page 3 of 9

Trincomalee in case bearing No. PPC 61/66/2018/1 to prevent the breach of peace threatened or

is likely to be threatened between the Party of the 1st Part and Party of the 2nd Part.

The Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge followed the provisions applicable

under Part VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, allowing the aforesaid

parties to file affidavits and counter affidavits and held the inquiry by way of written

submissions. Thereafter, the leaned Magistrate delivered the Order on 24.06.2019 in terms of

Section 68 (1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act declaring that the 1st Party was in

possession of the land in dispute. Further, acting under Section 68 (2) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act, the learned Magistrate granted the possession of the disputed land to the 1st Party

restraining the 2nd Party from preventing the 1st Party occupying the same.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the 2nd Party-Petitioner-Respondent invoked the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Trincomalee seeking to set aside or revise the said

Order. Subsequent to the filing of limited objections and the statement of objections by the 1st

Party-Respondent-Petitioner, Court allowed both parties to file written submissions. Thereafter,

the learned High Court Judge delivered the Order on 27.11.2019 setting aside the Order of the

Magistrates Court dated 24.06.2019.

Being dissatisfied with the said Order of the Provincial High Court, the 1st Party-Respondent-

Petitioner had invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court seeking to set aside or revise the

said Order of the Provincial High Court dated 27.11.2019. Consequent to the said application,

the 2nd Party-Petitioner-Respondent had filed statement of objections and thereafter the matter

was fixed for hearing.

It appears that the dispute has arisen between the parties in respect of a right of way marked as

Lot X2E leading to the Hindu temple. The 1st Party had made a complaint against the 2nd Party

saying the 2nd Party had broken the padlock which was put to the gate by the 1st Party in the

disputed portion of land which leads to the Hindu temple.

The 1st Party claims that the portion of land marked as X2E is a private right of way which

belongs to the 1st Party. Court draws attention to the Deed of Transfer bearing No. 1289 dated

Page 4 of 9

03.07.2015 [marked as 1i10] by which the 1st Party-Respondent became the lawful owner of the

land marked as Lot X2A and the right to reservation for road marked as X2B.

It was submitted on behalf of the 2nd Party-Petitioner-Respondent that originally one

Kanagasabai Jayabalasingham became the lawful owner of the land depicted as Lot X2A and Lot

X2B (reservation road) shown in plan bearing No. 659 dated 22.12.1980 which is part of the

entire land under and by virtue of Deed of Transfer bearing No. 693 dated 13.05.1981 [1j5].

Thereafter, the said Kanagasabai Jayabalasingham and his wife transferred a portion of the said

land Lot X2A and Lot X2B (only reservation for road) to the 1st Party by Deed bearing No. 1289

dated 03.07.2015.

It is seen that the said Kanagasabai Jayabalasingham and his wife had only transferred the

reservation for road [X2B] to the 1st Party, but not the said right to the 1st Party-Respondent.

Apparently, no right of way has been given on X2E (reservation road) to the 1st Party-

Respondent by virtue of the said Deed bearing No. 1289 dated 03.07.2015.

It appears that schedule of the Deed of Transfer No. 1290 dated 03.07.2015 [marked as 1i11]

annexed to the affidavit of the 1st Party-Respondent [vendee] describes lot No. X2C as follows;

North by: lot No. X2B reservation for 10 feet wide shown in plan No. 659

East by: lot No. X2E road reservation 10 feet wide

South by: lot No. X2D

West by: Inner Harbor Road

According to the affidavit of the 1st Party-Respondent, X2B road reservation in plan No. 659 is

in his possession and X2E road reservation is also in his possession.

Since the said 10 feet wide roadway X2E is the disputed pathway of the instant action, the

learned High Court Judge had come to a determination that the learned Primary Court Judge had

misdirected himself and had delivered the Order in favour of the 1st Party-Respondent in terms of

Section 68 (1) and Section 68 (2) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

Page 5 of 9

Furthermore, in terms of Section 72 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, a determination has to

be made under Section 68 and 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act after considering the

following matters;

a. the information filed and the affidavits and documents furnished;

b. such other evidence on any matter arising on the affidavits or documents furnished as the

court may permit to be led on that matter; and

c. such oral or written submission as may be permitted by the Judge of the Primary Court in

his discretion.

It appears that according to the information filed in the Primary Court/ Magistrates Court, and

the affidavits filed by the respective parties, the dispute between the parties is relating to a block

of land marked as lot X2E, which is admittedly a right of way.

It is seen that when an application is made in terms of Section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act, a Magistrate can largely make two Orders; one is under Section 68 which relates

to the possession of any land, whereas, the other is under Section 69 which relates to any right to

land other that the right to possession. The keyword under Section 68 is possession whereas,

the keyword under Section 69 is entitlement.

In the case of Arappalage Ruwan Saviour Bernard Vs. Hon. Attorney General CA (PHC)

177/2015, CA Minutes 13.12.2019, Mahinda Samayawardane J. has observed that there is a

notable difference between Section 68 and 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act with the

corresponding Section 147 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure.

Under Section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, the party who asserts such right shall

establish that he is entitled to that right. Similarly, Section 147 of the Indian Code of Criminal

Procedure refers to right to use of any land. It requires the Magistrate to decide whether such

right exists and then make an Order prohibiting any interference with the exercise of such right.

Interestingly, the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure looks for the existence of a right, whereas

our Primary Courts Procedure Act looks for the entitlement to a right. It is observable that, our

Section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act expects a heavier proof than its Indian

counterpart.

Page 6 of 9

On the available evidence, it is worthy to note that the 1st Party-Respondent does not have any

soil right to the impugned right of way (X2E) and the 1st Party has right of way only to X2B. It

was submitted on behalf of the 1st Party that his affidavit marked as X4 established that the 1st

Party commenced work to raise the wall and to install an electrical panel with industrial

electrical sockets in or about April 2018 and installed a new gate by replacing the existing one on

or about 15th July 2018.

The fact that the gate was customized and built for the 1st Party by Elcardo Corporation is

evident by the receipt marked as 1 14. The affidavits marked 1 18 to 1 18 corroborated the

position of the 1st Party that he fixed the electrical panel, raised the wall and replaced the existing

gate with a new gate on or about April 2018.

It was further submitted on behalf of the 1st Party that the only documents along with the

affidavits dated 06.11.2018 submitted by 2nd Party to support the purported use of the impugned

roadway were 2P12 and 2P14.

It was contended by the 1st Party that these affidavits appear to have been made for the purpose

of this case and thus, have no veracity. It is also further submitted that these documents were not

documents made or executed in the ordinary course of business. However, the receipt marked as

1 14 was obtained during the course of the transaction and not for the purpose of this case.

It is noteworthy that the Harbour Police instituted the said action bearing No BR/1141/2015 PC

against the 1st and 2nd Parties under Section 98 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The learned

Magistrate Judge of Trincomalee delivered the Order stating there was a public nuisance by the

1st Party (Niranjan Manickavasagar) and therefore to remove the fence constructed by the 1st

Party and not to prevent the devotees of the said temple from using the impugned right of way.

The said Order marked as 2P15 to the 2nd Partys affidavit which clearly shows that the 1st Party

had illegally and unlawfully preventing the devotees of the said temple from using the right of

way without any right.

The attention of Court is drawn to the information filed by the Complainant under and in terms

of Section 66(1) (a) of the Act marked as X1. It appears that the information was filed by the

Page 7 of 9

Complainant on or about the 2nd of October 2018 after inquiring into the complaint by the 1st

Party that the gate was broke opened, and attempts were made to remove it on or about the 27th

of September 2018.

The learned Primary Court Judge determined that the 2nd Party without any rights has attempted

to interfere with the possession of the 1st Party who had been in possession of the subject matter

on the date on which information was filed. Thus, the learned Primary Court Judge had made a

determination under the provisions of Section 68(1) of the Act stating that the 1st Party was

entitled to possession in terms of Section 68(2) of the Act.

As such, it clearly manifests, the learned Primary Court Judge has acted within the purview of

the provisions of Section 68 (1) & 68 (2) of the Act. On this premise, it is worthy to note Section

68 (1) and 68 (2) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act which stipulates,

68 (1) Where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or part thereof it shall

be the duty of the Judge of the Primary Court holding the inquiry to determine as to

who was in possession of the land or the part on the date of the filing of the

information under section 66 and make order as to who is entitled to possession of

such land or part thereof.

68 (2) An order under subsection (1) shall declare any one or more persons therein

specified to be entitled to the possession of land or part in the manner specified in

such order until such person or persons are evicted therefrom under an order or decree

of a competent court, and prohibit all disturbance of such possession otherwise than

under the authority of such an order or decree.

It was submitted on behalf of the 2nd Party that the 1st Party did not annex any document to show

that he was in possession at the time the information was filed against the 2nd Party. Therefore, it

appears that the 1st Party has not satisfied Section 68(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act. It

is evident that the 1st Party had installed a new gate on or about 15.07.2018 on the impugned

roadway. It was alleged by the 1st Party that the said gate was broke open and attempts were

made to remove it on or about 27.09.2018.

Page 8 of 9

However, since the information was filed on 02.10.2018, it is the task before this Court to

ascertain whether the 1st Party was in possession of the block of land relating to the disputed

roadway in terms of Section 68 (1) of the Act on the date of filing of the information.

It is pertinent to note that since the gate was broke opened on 27.09.2018, it is apparent that the

obstruction was cleared. Thus, the disputed roadway which led to the Hindu Temple was opened

for the use of devotees. Therefore, the 1st Party has not substantiated his contention that he was

in exclusive possession of the disputed portion of land on the date (02.10.2018) on which the

information was filed.

Hence, in view of Section 68 (2) of the Act, it is noteworthy that the learned Primary Court

Judge has erred in Law by declaring that the 1st Party is entitled to the possession of the disputed

roadway marked as X2E in plan bearing No. 659 dated 17.12.1980 [ 2P17]

The attention of Court was drawn to the Order made by the learned Magistrate in case bearing

No. BR/1141/PC/2015, filed under Section 98 of the Criminal Procedure Code, where the

learned Magistrate held ;

,

01 02 .

01 02

.

It appears that the learned Magistrate had given a direction to the 1st Party in the said case to

remove the obstructions on the disputed roadway heading to Thotathupillai Kovil within one

month from the Order dated 24.07.2018. It is observable that the 1st Party had not complied with

the said Order until the 2nd Party had removed the obstruction on or before 27.09.2018.

Page 9 of 9

In view of the aforesaid reasons, it amply proves that the 1st Party has no entitlement whatsoever

in respect of lot X2E, the impugned disputed roadway in this matter. It is relevant to note that the

learned High Court Judge had come to the correct findings of fact and law and decided the

disputed right of way as a public pathway. Thus, 1st Party had no right to prevent the 2nd Party

from using the disputed right of way.

Therefore, it is apparent that the learned Primary Court Judge had erred in Law by deciding the

case under Section 68 (1) and Section 68 (2) of the Act, which the 1st Party has failed to

substantiate in his contention.

Hence, the learned High Court Judge has correctly set aside the Order of the learned Primary

Court Judge dated 24.06.2019. As such, we see no reason for us to interfere with the

Order/Judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 27.11.2019.

Thus, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 35,000/-.

Appeal dismissed.
