The brief facts of the case as per the evidence led by the prosecution are as follows, The main witness Thennakoon Arachchilage Asanka Pradeep (PW1) has been transporting a load of rice bags in a lorry, from Kalmunei to Colombo. He has been the driver of the lorry. Nihal Senarathne (PW4) has been the assistant to the PW1. On their way to Colombo, they have stopped at Malsiripura for tea. Three persons have come and asked them whether they could get a lift to Colombo, to which they have agreed. In Kurunegala, the PW2 has got down from the vehicle with some goods. The PW1 has proceeded with the 3 persons to whom they agreed to give a lift to Colombo. 5. Thereafter, they have made another stop for tea at Rathmalgoda. After having tea, one person to whom they agreed to give a lift has held a pistol against his stomach, and another has held a knife against his neck. Thereafter, they have tied him up and strapped his mouth with tape. His eyes have also been covered with tape. However, as his ears were intact, he could hear the noises around him. The lorry was driven for about one hour before he was moved into another vehicle. He has got the feeling that it was a car. Then, he was taken to a house where he heard noises of children. Later, he has heard the sound of his lorry also being brought to the same place. He has also heard the sound of goods being unloaded from his lorry. Thereafter, they have moved him back to the lorry and stranded him off at a jungle. After getting himself unstrapped, he has driven the lorry to the nearest police station which was the Dodamgaslanda Police Station. They have finally referred to him to the Polgahawela Police Station. 6. He has been asked to come for an identification parade, and he has identified both the appellants at",
