Judgment

It is stated in paragraph 45 of the Written Submissions of the substituted

plaintiff respondent respondent dated 27.09.2019, that,

45. The petitioners position was, since the Daladawatta Road was

widened (This respondent denies this position) Malith M. de Silva Licensed

Surveyor has shifted the Northern boundary of the Corpus and thus the

extent of the Corpus of Preliminary Plan and Final Plan are identical.

3 | R I I 1 6 2 0 1 6 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

As per the Written Submissions of the petitioner petitioner (who is not a party in

the partition action) the Preliminary Plan is No. 1468 dated 18.01.1984 and

31.01.1984. It is marked as X.2A. The judgment was entered on 13.12.2004. The

Interlocutory Decree was entered on 25.02.2016. The Commission for Final

Scheme was issued to Mr. Malith M. de Silva, L.S. His Final Plan is No. 2705

dated 07.04.2016 and 18.05.2016. It is marked as X.13. Hence, X.13 was made

32 years after the making of X.2A.

The petitioners position is that the Wal Ehela Tree, which was shown in X.2A

as out (outside the Northern Boundary) has come into the land shown in X.13.

He says that Mr. Malith de Silva, L.S., has shifted the Northern boundary

towards North encroaching upon a private road.

The plaintiff denies that there was a widening of Daladawatte Road. His position

is that Mr. Malith de Silva has not shown the Wal Ehela tree since it is not on

the boundary. Denying that there was any widening of Daladawatte road, the

plaintiff states that Mr. Malith de Silva has not included in his plan the land

towards the North of the land shown in the Preliminary Plan.

Hence the basic question is, whether in X.13 the Northern boundary was shifted

towards North.

The petitioner states that X.14 a sketch was prepared by Mr. W. R. M.

Fernando, L.S. on 05.10.2016. As per the petitioner Mr. Fernando has surveyed

the private road towards the North of the subject matter.

The said Sketch has been prepared at the request of Thushara Gunethilake,

who is the petitioner. His Sketch shows the Northern boundary of X.2A in

blue. It shows Northern boundary of X.13 in green. It shows the Southern

boundary of Lot. 4 I and drain shown in plan No. 2 dated 16.06.1997 made by

A.M.R. Jayasekera L.S., (X.10) in red. It shows the resurvey of the existing

boundaries of Lot. 4 I of the said plan in black.

4 | R I I 1 6 2 0 1 6 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

What is shown in X.10 is the land called Mahawatte alias Delgahawatte, which

is the land towards the North of the subject matter in the partition action. The

subject matter of the partition action is Ketakelagahawatte.

In deed No. 480 dated 25.09.1940 by which Mestiyage Don Thedoris Goonetilleke

has sold Lot. 4 of Mahawatte alias Delgahawatte to Mestiyage Don Charles

Goonetilleke (X.7) the Southern boundary is Ketakelagahawatte.

In X.14 three Wal Ehela trees togetherwith a coconut tree falls outside the

blue line [outside the Northern boundary in X.2A] and fall inside the green line

[within the Northern boundary of X.13].

Attached to the petition dated 30.12.2016, the petitioner has affirmed in an

affidavit of the same date. He has produced X.14 by paragraph 13(b) of the said

affidavit. The statement of objections of the plaintiff is dated 16.08.2017. In

paragraph 9 (iii) the plaintiff states that X.14 is erroneous for the reasons, (a) the

entire plan has not been used for the superimposition (b) the extent of the land

has not been considered and (c) the plain itself is only a Sketch.

The statement of objections of 6B, 1A and 5A defendants are dated 26.06.2017.

At paragraph 7 the averments in paragraph 13 of the petition are denied without

elaborating reasons.

It is also stated at paragraph 10 that X.14 does not depict the Corpus [the

subject matter]

The petitioner does not say that X.14 depicted the subject matter.

The petitioner has pleaded his title to the land called Mahawatte alias

Delgahawatte in paragraphs 6 (a) and (b) 7 (a) (b) and (c) of the petition.

At the end of his Written Submissions the petitioner requests to allow his

application.

His application, as per the prayer to the petition is to,

5 | R I I 1 6 2 0 1 6 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

(b) to revise the order of the District Court dated 11.11.2016

[abbreviated]

.

(d) permit the petitioner to obtain a Commission to enable him to show

the extent of the land that has been taken from the land [towards] North

of the corpus (land sought to be partitioned) into the corpus in the final

plan bearing No. 2705 and the drain, the Northern boundary

(e) .

The petitioner does not ask to exclude any part of the land from plan No. 2705

(X.13) from the subject matter of the partition action by this application. His

application is to issue a Commission to show that he is correct.

As per paragraphs 14 and 15 of the petition, the petitioner has filed a petition

dated 05.10.2016 in the District Court for the purpose of asking an exclusion

and on 11.11.2016 after questioning Mr. Malith M. de Silva, L.S., the learned

District Judge has dismissed the petitioners application.

X.24 shows that on 11.11.2016 having recorded an oral application of the

petitioner and having also recorded that the plaintiff says that there are no

provisions in the Partition Law to grant the petitioners application and having

also recorded that 1A defendant accepts the position of the plaintiff, the learned

District Judge has made a bench order running into 3 paragraphs and rejected

the application of the petitioner.

He has commenced his order by saying that the partition action was instituted

on 03.07.1983. Hence there has been, in his mind, a wish to conclude it as soon

as possible. While no one can say that this is not good, an application has to be

disposed not by hurrying alone but by reasoned deliberations.

6 | R I I 1 6 2 0 1 6 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

The learned District Judge considers facts [the merits or demerits of the

application of the petitioner] only in the 3rd paragraph of his order. It contains 9

sentences, out of which certain sentences are the narration. The reasoning is in

3 sentences.

They are, It is revealed that there was no road on the Northern boundary

when the final plan was made. Furthermore, the plan No. 2 marked D

relied upon by the petitioner is made in 1997. Hence it cannot be accepted

the alleged position that a part of petitioners land has been included when

the final plan was prepared.

That reasoning is not sufficient at any standards.

Although what was called plan D, presently marked as X.10 was prepared by

Mr. Jayasekera, L.S., in 1997, the perusal of it shows that it is based on plan

No. 2529 dated 25.07.1938 of Mr. J. R. A. Rodrigo, L.S.

There are preliminary objections raised by the plaintiff. They are,

(1) This application for revision and restitutio in integrum cannot be maintained

as the petitioner is not a party to the partition action.

The correctness of the line of authorities that says that a person who is not a

party cannot bring an application for restitutio in integrum, need not be

examined since the petitioners application is also for revision and a nonparty

can successfully maintain an application for revision.

(2) The petitioner is guilty of suppression of material facts or misrepresentation

and has not come with clean hand.

The reason for this application is that, the petitioner, said in the District Court

that towards the North of the Northern boundary of the subject matter, there

was a part of land belonging to the state which he does not say in this Court.

Considering the question at issue, this is not a material question. The material

7 | R I I 1 6 2 0 1 6 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

question is that however old a partition action can be, its subject matter cannot

include any part of the lands outside the subject matter.

(3) The petitioner has not averred exceptional circumstances.

Whereas, there is a difference between the old section 753 and present section

753 of the Civil Procedure Code, which was appreciated in Jax Fernando vs.

The Ceylon Brewery Limited (1999)., the Court of Appeal judgment of Justice

U. de Z. Gunewardane [although a part of this case was overruled by the

Supreme Court, in THE CEYLON BREWERY LIMITED v. JAX FERNANDO,

PROPRIETOR, MARADANA WINE STORES, (2001) 1 SLR 271, the aforesaid

part was preserved intact] questions whether there is a need for exceptional

circumstances any longer, the want of proper consideration in X.24 itself, is an

exceptional reason to invoke the powers of revision.

As the Chief justice Melanie Claude Sansoni said in Mariam Beebee vs. Sayed

Mohamed (1965) 68 NLR 36,

The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite

independent of and distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of the Court.

Its object is the due administration of justice. It is exercised in some cases

by a Judge of his own motion, when an aggrieved person who may not be

a party to the action brings to his notice the fact that, unless the power is

exercised, injustice will result. The Partition Act has not, I conceive, made

any changes in this respect and the power can still be exercised in respect

of any order or decree of a lower Court.

As per section 26(2)(f) of Partition Law No. 21 of 1977, the Interlocutory Decree

can exclude a part of the land from the subject matter. It says,

(f) order that any specified portion of the land sought to be partitioned or

surveyed be excluded from the scope of the action;

Hence it cannot be said that there are no provisions to grant the application of

the petitioner.

8 | R I I 1 6 2 0 1 6 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t h a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e P r a d e e p K i r t h i s i n g h e

The judgment of the Court of Appeal in CA/RII/4/2016 dated 26.11.2018 does

not apply to this case, since in that case the Court found that the parents of the

petitioners were parties although the petitioner said that he has not been made

a party.

Hence invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court, the order dated

11.11.2016 is set aside.

The learned district judge is directed to issue a Commission to enable the

petitioner to show the extent of land [if any] that has been taken from the land

[towards] North of the subject matter into the land shown in X.13.

If the petitioner can show that there is a part to be excluded, the Interlocutory

Decree shall be amended accordingly.

The petitioner will bear the expenses of the Commission [As per the opinion of

the Commissioner, it could be a Commission only to Superimpose the relevant

plans, whereas he is at liberty to survey any land or lands if the need arises]

The petitioner is entitled to the costs of this application.
