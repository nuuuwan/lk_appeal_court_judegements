JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General on three counts under

Section 296,300 and 315 of the Penal Code in the High court of Ratnapura.

As the Appellant opted for a non-jury trial, the trial commenced before a

judge and the prosecution had led seven witnesses and marked production

P1-10 and closed the case. The Learned High Court Judge having satisfied

that evidence presented by the prosecution warrant a case to answer,

called for defence and explained the rights of the accused. Having selected

the right to make a statement from the dock, the Appellant had proceeded

to deny the charge by way of his dock statement.

After considering the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the

defence, the Learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellant as

charged and imposed the sentence on 19/03/2015 as follows:

1. First Count - sentenced the Appellant to death.

2. Count Two - 05 years rigorous imprisonment with a compensation of

Rs.250000/-. In default 12-month simple imprisonment.

3. Count Three 18 months rigorous imprisonment with a

compensation of Rs.25000/-. In default 03 months simple

imprisonment.

3 | P a g e

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the

Appellant had given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the

Covid 19 pandemic. At the hearing the Appellant was connected via Zoom

platform from prison.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the

Appellant.

1. The prosecution has failed to prove the existence of murderous

intention of the Appellant.

2. The Learned High Court Judge had reversed the presumption of

innocence.

3. The evidence is not supported the conclusion reached by the Learned

High Court Judge in his judgment.

4. The High Court Judge has not considered the evidence favourable to

the Appellant in his judgment.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

According to PW4 Poornima, on the date of the incident when she was

having dinner with her deceased father in the kitchen, her sister Nayana

had come running from the direction of the hall shouting that the Appellant

had come and asked her to run. Her sister Nayana also showed the injury

on her hand said to have been inflicted by the Appellant. When PW4

rushed up to the kitchen door the Appellant had come there. When she ran

out and looked backed had seen the deceased was on the floor and the

Appellant was on her fathers body and inflicting the injury to her father.

When she pulled the Appellant by his T-shirt, the Appellant had stabbed on

her head. As such she had been hospitalized and received treatment. Her

Medico Legal Report was marked as P3 by the prosecution. She had seen

4 | P a g e

the Appellant inflicting injury on the deceased with a close proximity of the

incident.

The Appellant is the son of PW4s mothers sister. The Appellant had stayed

in the deceaseds house for a brief period of time previously. During this

time the Appellants family had proposed the Appellant to one of her

sisters, which had been vehemently turned down by the deceased. Due to

this disappointment the Appellant, six months prior to this incident had

come to the deceaseds house brandishing a knife and created an

unpleasant scene. For this a complaint was lodged at the Ehaliyagoda

Police Station and after police inquiry, the police had settled the matter

imposing a condition that the Appellant should not visit deceaseds house.

According to PW3 Nayana Kumari, when she was having a chat with her

Uncle Karunaratna in the hall, she had suddenly felt that something had

struck on her hand. When she looked had seen that she had sustained an

injury on her hand. At the same time, she had seen the presence of the

Appellant and she ran into the house alerting others that the Appellant had

come. After a while when she came to the house, she had seen her

deceased father was lying fallen near the kitchen door bleeding due to

injuries. She also confirmed the enmity existed between the Appellant and

the deceaseds family. She too had been hospitalized and the Medico Legal

Report pertaining to her injuries was marked as P2 in the trial.

PW5 Achini is a relation of the deceased and on the date of incident she

had gone to meet one of the daughters of the deceased when the incident

had taken place. When she was talking to Damayanthi inside a room,

heard shouting in the direction of the hall. When she looked through the

window had seen PW3 running and shouting that the Appellant had come.

She had also seen the Appellant chasing PW3. Due to fear, she had run to

her house and when she came back, she had seen the deceased was lying

fallen near the kitchen door and others were weeping near the deceased.

5 | P a g e

Officers from the Weligepola Police Station had conducted investigations,

arrested the accused on the following day and recovered a knife and short

sleeved shirt based upon his statement under Section 27(1) of the Evidence

Ordinance.

According to medical evidence one deep stab injury was found on the chest

of the deceased. According to PW13, the death could have occurred due to

haemorrhage shock due to a stab on the left anterior wall, penetrating to

the heart.

After the closer of the prosecution case, the defence was called and the

Appellant had made a statement from the dock. In his dock statement the

Appellant had admitted that he went to deceaseds house to discuss his

love affair he had with one of the daughters of the deceased. At that time

due to a sudden fight this incident had happened.

In the first ground of appeal the appellant contends that the prosecution

has failed to prove the existence of murderous intention of the Appellant.

The essence of criminal law has been said to lie in the maxim- actus non

facit reum nisi mens sit rea. The essence of an offence is the wrongful

intent, without which it cannot exist.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment at page 327 of the brief very

extensively analysed the evidence of PW4 who is the eye witness in this

case. The Appellant had gone to the deceaseds house despite the warning

given to him by the Ehaliyagoda Police due to a previous incident. Hence,

going to deceaseds house on that day clearly shows his malicious

intention.

PW3 had vividly explained in her evidence that the Appellant had a cordial

relationship with deceaseds family before the wedding proposal was

brought to the deceaseds daughter Anoma. The cordial relationship was

stained when the deceased opposed to the said wedding proposal. As the

Appellant started to fight with the deceaseds family a complained was

6 | P a g e

lodged at the Ehaliyagoda Police station. Even though she admitted

existence of a love affair between with deceaseds daughter Anoma and the

Appellant, but no connection whatsoever existed with the Appellant and

Anoma at the time of the incident.

It is the uncontradicted evidence of lay witnesses that on seeing the

Appellant, witnesses raised cries and ran for safety. This clearly indicates

the amount of animosity the Appellant had towards the deceaseds family

prior to the incident. When the Appellant entered the deceaseds house

despite being barred by the police, clearly infers intention for launching a

murderous attack on the inmates of deceaseds house. Hence, it is

incorrect to say that the prosecution has not proven existence of

murderous intention. Therefore, considering the first appeal, it has no

merit.

In the second ground of appeal the Learned Counsel contends that the

Learned High Court Judge had reversed the presumption of innocence.

Although, the Learned Counsel drew to the attention of the pages 326 -327

of the brief to substantiate the second ground of appeal in favour of the

Appellant, but after reading the said pages revealed that the Learned High

Court Judge had not reversed the burden of proof on the Appellant. The

Learned High Court Judge only considered the dock statement of the

Appellant to negate his stance that he acted in self-defence to escape from

the deceased. Hence, this ground too devoid of any merit.

In the third ground of appeal the appellant argues that the evidence does

not support the conclusion reached by the Learned High Court Judge in

his judgment.

The Learned High Court Judge has considered the evidence presented by

both parties to arrive at his conclusion. The Learned Counsel for the

Appellant highlighting the page 328 of the brief submits that the Learned

High Court Judge in his judgment submitted that even though the

7 | P a g e

Appellant had taken up the position that he was assaulted by a person

called Karunaratna with an axe, the Learned High Court Judge in his

judgment had concluded that it has not been proved through the medical

evidence.

The Appellant had been examined by PW13 DMO of Weligedera Hospital on

17/10/2008. The doctor had checked his body and noted a mild abrasion

in the middle of his left forearm which had been categorised as a non-

grievous injury. He has opined that the injury could have been sustained

due to the contact with hard object. The Medico Legal Report of the

appellant was marked as P-4 by the prosecution.

Although the Appellant had taken up the position that the incident had

occurred due to a sudden fight ensued with one Karunaratna who had

assaulted him with an mamoty when he entered the deceaseds house. But

according to PW13 he had noted a mild abrasion on at middle of left

forearm of the Appellant. Hence, the Learned High Court Judge had very

correctly come to the conclusion that the position taken by the Appellant in

his dock statement had not been reflected in his Medico Legal Report.

Therefore, this ground also has no merit.

In the final ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the Learned High

Court Judge has not considered the evidence favourable to the Appellant in

his judgment.

With all the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defence, it

appears that the Learned High Court Judge had appropriately evaluated

the evidence in delivering his verdict. The Learned High Court Judge had

considered the dock statement of the Appellant in the judgment. Hence, it

is incorrect to say that the Learned High Court Judge had not considered

the evidence favourable to the Appellant. Hence, this ground also has no

merit.

8 | P a g e

In this case the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses are not tainted

with uncertainty or ambiguity and it certainly passes the probability test.

Therefore, I conclude that the prosecution had succeeded in adducing

highly incriminating evidence against the Appellant and thereby

established the charges beyond reasonable doubt.

As such, I conclude, that this is not an appropriate case in which to

interfere with the findings of the Learned High Court Judge of Rathnapura

dated 19/03/2015. Hence, I dismiss the Appeal.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to

the High Court of Rathnapura along with the original case record.
