Facts in Brief

PW-01 Krishantha Ruwan Kumara was a Sub-Inspector of Police attached to the

Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB). While on duty on 13th November 2010, he has

been informed by PS 27378 Priyantha, who was also an officer attached to the

PNB that he received an information of a Heroin trafficking incident in the Mount

Lavinia area, which he has taken down in his pocket notebook. PW-01 has

inspected the pocket notebook and has found that the note has been to the effect

that a person will be arriving near De Vos Hotel Mount Lavinia to handover

Heroin to another person. After placing his initials on the notebook and obtaining

the relevant authority to conduct a raid from his higher officials, PW-01 has left

the PNB at around 9.30 a.m. accompanied by 14 other police officers. Out of

them, two had been in their uniform while others were in civilian clothing. They

have used a jeep belonging to the PNB and a private van belonging to one of the

Sub-Inspectors who participated in the raid. They have gone up to the Dehiwala

Town Council building and have met the personal informant of PS Priyantha.

PW-01 has been informed that a person called Camilas will be coming near the

De Vos Hotel with a parcel of Heroin to hand it over to another person. He has

asked the police team to wait near the petrol shed situated near the Mount

Lavinia Court house until he provides details about the time the said person will

be arriving. PW-01 and his team has waited near the petrol shed for nearly five

hours expecting further information about the suspect. At 15.30 hours, the

informant has returned and has informed that the person will come between 4-

5 p.m., and that he will be able to point out the person to them.

After informing his team to act on his instructions, PW-01 accompanied by the

earlier mentioned PS Priyantha and the informant, has walked across the road

and passing the De Vos Hotel gone up to De Seram Road junction and has waited

expecting the suspect to arrive. Around 16.15 hours, he has observed a three-

wheeler numbered 204/3410 arriving in front of the hotel and a well-built person

alighting from the three-wheeler. He has observed that person paying money to

the three-wheeler driver and at that point, the informant has informed the

Page 4 of 17

witness that it was Camilas, the person whom they were expecting. PW-01 has

also observed the person carrying a blue-coloured plastic bag in his right hand.

PW-01 and PS Priyantha has confronted the person and when informed of their

identity, the said person has attempted to escape, however, after struggling with

him for about 10 minutes, PW-01 has been able to handcuff him. After taking

charge of the bag the arrested suspect was carrying, he has found two other

parcels with brown-coloured gum tape inside the earlier mentioned blue-

coloured bag. After piercing the two parcels, he has found that the two parcels

having a brown-coloured powder. Upon inspection, he has identified the said

brown-coloured powder as Heroin due to his experience as a police officer. After

that, PW-01 has arrested the said person Camilas Pillai alias Noor Mohomad

Paaris at 6.30 p.m. for the offence of having Heroin in his possession.

At the trial, he has identified the appellant as the person he arrested on that day.

After getting down the other officers to the place of the arrest, the three-wheeler

and the driver with whom the appellant arrived has been searched and

questioned, and after being satisfied that the three-wheeler driver had no

connection to the appellant but has only come on a regular hire, he has been

released after recording a statement from him. PW-01 has taken the Heroin

recovered to his custody along with the appellant. He has also recovered several

items belonging to the appellant from his possession. Subsequently, after

questioning the appellant, he and his team of officers have gone to a place near

S.D. Jayasinghe playground and had waited till 6.40 a.m. on the following day,

expecting another person to arrive. However, no one has come and PW-01 and

the raiding party, has returned to the PNB at 6.40 in the morning.

At the PNB, he has marked the first parcel as KP 1 and the second parcel as KP

2. When weighed, KP 1 had a weight of 513 grams including the bag. KP 2 had

514 grams inclusive of the bag. PW-01 has taken necessary steps to parcel and

seal the productions. After keeping the productions in his personal locker at the

PNB, the productions have been handed over to the production officer of the PNB

Page 5 of 17

at 8.10 a.m. on the 15th November 2010. At the trial, the witness has marked

the relevant productions and has identified the productions accordingly.

Under cross-examination, it has been the position of the appellant that he was

in fact arrested on the 11th and kept in police custody until 13th November, which

the witness has denied. It has been suggested that the appellant was in fact

arrested at a place called Jayalath Restaurant situated in Ja-ela while being with

another person. It has also been suggested to the witness that the appellant and

the other person was taken to a house situated within the Katunayake Airport

Complex and detained there, which the witness had denied. The witness has

been questioned in detail into the manner the police officers enter notes in their

information books. It has been suggested to the witness that he and his team

detected a large quantity of Heroin at a house in Puttalam and introduced a part

of it to the appellant and that PW-01 is acting maliciously towards the appellant.

PW-01 has denied any knowledge of the appellant being an informant which led

to the discovery of items belonging to the LTTE, and has denied that he conspired

with any politician in order to fix the appellant to the crime.

The earlier mentioned PS 27378 Priyantha (PW-02) was retired from the police

service at the time he gave evidence. His evidence has been similar to that of the

PW-01 and there are no contradictions or omissions in his evidence. Under

cross-examination it has been his evidence that it was PW-01 who inspected the

two bags found in the possession of the appellant and it never came into his

possession during the raid. It was also his position that it was the other officers

who came to the scene subsequently, searched the three-wheeler and questioned

the driver, therefore, he is unable to give evidence in that regard. However, he

has admitted that the three-wheeler was released then and there. It has been his

evidence that it was he who received the first information and after noting it in

his pocket notebook, revealed the information to PW-01 which led to this raid.

He too has denied the suggestion put forward on behalf of the appellant that he

was in fact arrested on the 11th and the Heroin was introduced to him. He has

been questioned whether there was an incident of recovery of 11 Kg. and 870

Page 6 of 17

grams of Hashish and arrest of two persons in the Puttalam area for which he

has answered, stating since he has conducted large number of detections is

unable to say anything without looking at his notes in this regard. Questions

have been put to the witness which appears to suggest that part of the drugs

found in the earlier mentioned detection has been introduced to the appellant

which the witness has denied. It was also his evidence that he and the PW-01

had to struggle with the appellant before he was arrested.

In this action, the prosecution has led evidence to prove the chain of custody of

the productions as well as the evidence of the Government Analyst to prove the

quantity of Heroin sent for their analysis. The Government Analyst in evidence

has confirmed that in the parcel marked KP1 and in the parcel marked KP 2, she

identified 153.1 grams and 160.4 grams of pure Heroin respectively.

At the end of the prosecution case, learned High Court Judge, after considering

the evidence placed before the Court has decided to call for a defence from the

appellant. Accordingly, the appellant has chosen to make an unsworn statement

from the dock. It has been his position that the evidence that he was arrested in

Mount Lavinia and detained at the S.D.S. Jayasinghe grounds on that night was

complete falsehood. It was his position that he was arrested on the 11th of

November 2010 while being at the Jayalath Holiday Resort in Ja-ela. According

to him, he was arrested along with one Nelson and was detained at a house near

the airport, and the said Nelson was released on the following day and he was

taken to Puttalam area in the night of the 13th. In Puttalam, three persons were

arrested along with drugs was his position. It has been stated by him that he

was never arrested with drugs but it was his belief that part of the drugs found

in the possession of the persons who were arrested in Puttalam was introduced

to him. He has also stated that he was instrumental in finding a large haul of

arms and because of that, a politician had to face difficulties, and that also may

be a reason for this incident.

Page 7 of 17

It has been his position that, he hired the three-wheeler from Wellawatte and he

had Rs. 3000/- in his possession and the driver of the three-wheeler was also

arrested and he is unaware of what has happened to him. He has stated further,

that although the driver has been listed as PW-14 in the indictment, he was not

called to give evidence and if called, it is his belief that he will speak the truth.

At the conclusion of the evidence and after hearing the submissions of the

parties, the judgement of this action has been pronounced on 26th March 2014,

where the learned High Court Judge found the appellant guilty for both the

counts referred against the appellant. He was sentenced to death accordingly.

The Grounds of Appeal: -

At the hearing of his appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel formulated the

following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. Whether reasonable doubt arises with regard to the way the PW-01

and PW-02 gave evidence in relation to the first information received.

2. The subsequent steps taken after the receipt of the first information

as stated by PW-01 and 02, does it cause a doubt in the prosecution

case.

3. The versions given by PW-01 and 02 with regard to the arrest of the

appellant are contradictory and would it cause a reasonable doubt in

the case of the prosecution.

4. Inter se and per se contradictions between PW-01 and 02 were not

considered in the correct perspective by the learned High Court Judge.

5. There was a discrepancy of 35.4 grams on the gross weight of the

Heroin alleged to have been found in the possession of the appellant

when weighed at the PNB and at the Government Analyst Department,

which has not been explained.

6. The improbabilities of the time taken and the explanation given by

the witnesses in relation to the raid that happened at 4.30 p.m. and

returning to the PNB only at 6.30 a.m. on the following day.

Page 8 of 17

7. The failure of the learned High Court Judge to properly evaluate the

evidence, and misdirection with regard to the dock statement of the

appellant.

8. The learned High Court Judge in determining the dock statement of

the appellant has placed an unreasonable and unfair burden on the

appellant on his failure to lead evidence that could have been led by the

appellant.

9. The non-arrest and the release of the three-wheeler driver who was

named as the 14th witness in the indictment, where he could have been

the only independent witness in this case. In addition, the failure by

the police to take down his address when recording a statement from

him, but only his NIC number. Can the learned High Court Judge

attribute this failure to the appellant on the basis that he did not take

any further steps to call the said witness.

10. Based on the judgement, a question arises whether a fair trial was

held against the appellant.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

In his submissions before the Court, it was the view of the learned Presidents

Counsel that, since the witnesses called by the prosecution in order to prove the

raid are highly trained officers and the tendency is to have no infirmities, such

evidence needs to be carefully scrutinized by the Court, for which I am in total

agreement.

In this appeal, there had been no challenge to the chain of custody of the

productions. It appears from the grounds of appeals urged, that the learned

Presidents Counsel is mostly relying on the evidence of PW-01 and 02 in relation

to the actual detection and the arrest of the appellant and the legal principles

that should he considered in order to find an accused guilty to a charge of this

nature.

Page 9 of 17

With the above in mind, I will now proceed to consider the grounds of appeal

urged in detail, while giving consideration to the submissions made in that

regard by the learned Presidents Counsel as well as the learned Additional

Solicitor General (ASG) on behalf of the respondent.

The 1st and the 2nd Grounds of Appeal: -

Since the above two grounds of appeal are interrelated, they will be considered

together. The learned Presidents Counsel challenged the credibility of the 1st

information on the basis that PW-01 has given contradictory evidence as to what

he was informed by PW-02, and the actions they took after the receipt of the

information. It was the submission of the learned ASG, that the evidence in that

regard has not caused any doubt in the prosecution case.

PW-01, the officer who led the team of police officers to conduct the raid has

stated in his evidence (at page 37 of the Appeal Brief), that he received the

information from PS Priyantha about trafficking of Heroin in the Mount Lavinia

area. After stating so, he has clarified further, stating that PS Priyantha has

recorded that information in his pocket notebook on page 198. He has stated in

detail that the information had been to the effect that a person is coming near

the Mount De Vos Hotel in Mount Lavinia to handover Heroin to some other

person. The evidence of PW-02 PS 27378 Priyantha confirms that it was the very

first information received by him, and he informed that to PW-01 who was his

superior officer.

I find no basis to conclude that the evidence of PW-01 and 02 are contradictory

to each other with regard to the first information received. It is clear from the

evidence of PW-01 that, what he has stated initially was a general statement of

the information provided to him by PW-02. Later he has narrated the information

received by him in detail, where it has been stated that after reading the

information recorded in the pocket notebook of PW-02, he placed his signature

on it. I find no basis whatsoever to conclude that a reasonable doubt has been

created with regard to the 1st information received by PW-02. According to the

Page 10 of 17

evidence led at the trial, after receiving the information, PW-01 has arranged a

team of 15 police officers to conduct the raid and they have travelled in two

vehicles in order to conduct the raid. I am unable to agree with the contention

that this is not the probable behaviour if the intention was to arrest a single

person. The decision-making process of an officer who decides to conduct a raid

will depend on the assessment made by that particular officer as to his

requirements in conducting the raid. It was the argument of the learned

Presidents Counsel that, if PW-01 was accompanied by 14 other officers, why

only the PW-01 and 02 was instrumental in arresting the appellant. It was the

evidence, they had to arrest him after a struggle of about 10 minutes, which in

his view was highly suspicious evidence with regard to the arrest of the appellant.

According to the evidence of PW-01, he has instructed the other police officers

and the vehicles to wait some distance away from where the informant has

informed that the person will come to deliver the drugs, and only him and PW-

02 went and waited in the vicinity of the hotel expecting the suspect to arrive.

There again, it relates to the decision-making process of the officer who

conducted the raid. It may be possible that he did not want to arouse suspicion

of their activity by calling an unnecessary number of officers to the actual place

of the raid. Similarly, the officers waiting in their vehicles for over five hours for

the conduct of the raid, and taking the appellant when he was arrested around

4.30 p.m. to a playground, and waiting there until the next morning are matters

that can happen in the ordinary course of events when a group of trained police

officers conduct such a raid. PW-01 has explained as to why they decided to wait

until the following morning, explaining that they were waiting for a call from

another person to the appellant, which did not materialize.

Be that as it may, the witnesses have not been confronted on these matters when

they gave evidence. Had it been done, there may be more explanations than what

is available in evidence if the appellant or his Counsel for that matter, wanted

the witnesses to answer such concerns. I am of the view that, without

confronting the witnesses in a proper manner when they gave evidence, it is not

Page 11 of 17

open to argue that their evidence has created a doubt in the prosecution case.

Hence, I find no merit in the above considered grounds of appeal.

The 3rd Ground of Appeal: -

The reason to argue that there are contradictory positions in the way the

appellant was arrested is on the basis of what has been stated by the witnesses

as to what happened just before the appellant was confronted by them. PW-01

in his evidence has stated that he saw the appellant paid the three-wheeler

driver, and thereafter, he and PW-02 went near him. It was the evidence of PW-

02 that the appellant was confronted while he was in the process of paying

money to the three-wheel driver. I find no contradiction in that regard as argued.

It is clear, that if one reads the evidence in its totality, both the witnesses had

said the same thing in different ways.

A question has been posed as to why they did not call other officers who took

part in the raid to assist them if they had to struggle with the appellant for over

10 minutes before he was handcuffed and arrested. I am unable to find a reason

to conclude that it has created a reasonable doubt with regard to the arrest, as

it may be possible for trained police officers to confront one person in the manner

they have stated in their evidence. I find nothing unusual in summoning the rest

of the raiding party only after the arrest was made.

The 4th Ground of Appeal: -

I am unable to agree with the contention that there are contradictions inter se

and per se of the evidence of PW-01 and 02 that should have been considered as

materially relevant in this case. The evidence in relation to the earlier mentioned

grounds of appeal cannot be considered contradictions as stated above. I find no

basis to conclude that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider any

material contradictions in the manner that should have been considered.

Page 12 of 17

The 5th Ground of Appeal: -

The discrepancies between the gross weight as stated by the PW-01 and the

Government Analyst are concerned, I find that the evidence of the Government

Analyst has provided a clear insight in that regard. PW-01 has weighed the two

parcels which he has been marked as KP1 and KP2 for the purposes of

identification. It is clear from the evidence, that the weighing of the two parcels

had been inclusive of the covers and not only the brown-coloured powder found

inside. When weighed under that condition, parcel KP1 had shown a weight of

513 grams, and KP2 had a weight of 514 grams.

Evidence of the Government Analyst who was the PW-16 of this case has been

clear that any weighing done under laboratory conditions is much more accurate

than that of a weighing done under normal conditions. According to the evidence

of the Government Analyst, the two parcels received, marked KP1 and KP2 were

parcels covered in polythene and gum tape. Once weighed, after separating the

content from the wrapping material, the gross quantity of the powder found in

KP1 has been weighed at 496.7 grams and KP2 at 494.8 grams. The discrepancy

in each of the weights given when the productions were handed over to the

Government Analysts has been well explained. It has been stated that when

weighed separately, each of the two parcels packing material had a weight of

around 17 grams, which goes on to show that there was no discrepancy as to

the weight of the Heroin found as claimed. I find no basis for the considered

ground of appeal.

The 6th Ground of Appeal: -

As I have stated earlier, the purpose of this raid has been to nab any person or

persons involved in the Heroin trade as established by the evidence of the

witnesses. The officers who conducted the raid are officers from the PNB who are

specialized in conducting raids of this nature. PW-01 has explained as to the

reasons why he and his team of officers waited until 6.30 in the following

morning at a nearby playground. He has explained that he was expecting another

Page 13 of 17

person to call the appellant. It is clear that their intention had been to nab that

person as well, if it was possible. Therefore, I am unable to agree that it was

improbable for the officers of the PNB, to wait such a long period expecting

another arrest or arrival of a suspect, given the facts and the circumstances of

the case as revealed in evidence.

The 7th and the 8th Grounds of Appeal: -

After summarizing the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and after analyzing

the said witnesses, it is clear from the judgement that the learned High Court

Judge has drawn his attention to the defence taken by the appellant. At page 67

of the judgement, the learned High Court Judge has reproduced the dock

statement made by the appellant in his entity and has considered whether his

statement and the stand taken by him when the prosecution witnesses gave

evidence, has created a reasonable doubt on the case of the prosecution or has

given a reasonable explanation as to the evidence against him. I find that this is

the correct approach that should be followed when considering the defence of an

accused person in a criminal trial. I am unable to agree that the learned High

Court Judge has imposed an additional burden on the appellant, by expecting

the appellant to prove certain facts. It is clear, the views expressed by the learned

High Court Judge was not on that basis, but in order to find whether the version

of events as narrated by the appellant has created a doubt in the prosecution

case and nothing more.

It needs to be noted that the stand of the appellant, when PW-01 gave his

evidence and cross-examined was on the basis that a part of a large haul of

Heroin detected by PW-01 and his team was introduced to him. However, when

PW-02 was giving evidence, the position taken on behalf of the appellant had

been that a large haul of Hashish had been recovered and was introduced among

several persons. When making a dock statement, the appellant has stated

without specifying, that it may be the part of the drugs detected in Puttalam that

was introduced to him.

Page 14 of 17

This shows that the stand of the appellant had not been consistent. The

documents produced marked V1 and V2 when the appellant made his dock

statement, have never been produced when the relevant witnesses gave evidence.

Therefore, the said documents have no value as rightly considered by the learned

High Court Judge. It is after considering all these factors in its totality, the

learned High Court Judge has concluded that the defence put forward by the

appellant has not created any doubt as to the cogent and trustworthy evidence

placed before the Court by the prosecution nor has it provided a reasonable

explanation.

Another matter that needs to be considered in relation to the consideration of

the dock statement is the fact that the appellant has made two contradictory

statements in his dock statement, as viewed correctly by the learned High Court

Judge. In the first part of his statement, he has taken up the stand that he was

arrested on the 11th, taken to Puttalam, and part of the drugs taken from another

party was introduced to him. However, in the second part of his statement, he

has stated that I came with the three-wheeler driver on a hire from Wellawatte

and I had Rs. 3000/- with me. The three-wheeler driver was also arrested and I

do not know what happened to him. He was the person who has been named as

PW-14 in the indictment but he was not called to give evidence, if called he may

speak the truth.

By the said statement, he has virtually accepted that he was arrested in the

manner stated by the prosecution witnesses.

Although the learned Presidents Counsel made an attempt in his submission to

show that in fact, he was referring to his arrest at a restaurant in Puttalam, I

find no basis to agree. I am of the view that, the conclusion in that regard reached

by the learned High Court Judge was the only conclusion that can be reached in

relation to the dock statement of the appellant.

Page 15 of 17

The 9th Ground of Appeal: -

The learned Presidents Counsel questioned the procedure adopted by PW-01 in

releasing the three-wheeler driver in whose three-wheeler the appellant is alleged

to have arrived. It was his contention that although the said three-wheeler driver

who should have been the only independent witness to the incident has been

named as the 14th witness for the prosecution, his address has not been

mentioned on the list of witnesses. It was his view that the learned High Court

Judge was wrong to attribute the failure of the prosecution to disclose the correct

address of the witness to the appellant by saying that he has failed to take any

further steps to call him as a witness for himself if he so desired. It is clear from

the evidence that PW-01 and PW-02 has determined that the three-wheeler

driver has no connection to the person who came in the three-wheeler, because

according to their evidence, they have seen the appellant paying the hire for the

three-wheeler before his arrest. Besides that, it is in evidence that, his statement

has been recorded before his release. I find that it is not unusual when a

detection of this nature is made, not to arrest persons who clearly appear not

involved in the crime. However, I find that there is a lapse on the part of the

officer who recorded the statement of the three-wheeler driver as admitted

correctly by the learned ASG. However, I am unable to agree that it has created

a doubt in the prosecution case, as a prosecuting Counsel is not bound to call

all the witnesses named in the indictment. There is no basis to believe that the

prosecution deliberately withheld the evidence of the three-wheeler driver.

In the case of King vs. Chalo Singho 72 NLR 269, it was held:

Prosecuting counsel is not bound to call all the witnesses named on the

back of the indictment or tender them for cross-examination. In exceptional

circumstances, the presiding judge may ask the prosecuting counsel to call

such a witness or may call him as a witness of the court. There is no

misdirection by the judge when he omits to refer to the presumption under

section 114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance in cases which the Crown does not

Page 16 of 17

call or tender for cross-examination on the request of the prisoners counsel,

a witness whose name appears at the back of the indictment and whom the

prisoners counsel has himself an opportunity of calling.

However, in the case under consideration, the learned Counsel who represented

the appellant has in fact obtained summons to call witness number 14. It has

not been possible due to the fact that no address has been given with regard to

him. Although it was not correct for the learned High Court Judge to comment

that the appellant has not taken any further steps to call the said witness on his

behalf, what needs to be looked at here is whether the non-calling of the said

witnesses can lead to the presumption in terms of section 114 (f) of the Evidence

Ordinance.

Section 114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows;

That evidence could be and is not produced would, if produced, be

unfavourable to the persons who withholds it. [Emphasis added]

In this matter, the evidence elicited has clearly shown that the three-wheeler

driver has had no connection with the detection of Heroin. Therefore, he has

been promptly released. Even if called for the prosecution, he will not be in a

position to give evidence other than to the effect that his vehicle was hired by the

appellant and the appellant was arrested by the police.

In his dock statement, even the appellant has stated that the three-wheeler

driver went with him on a hire from Wellawatte area and he was also arrested

but is unaware of what happened to him thereafter. In my view, this goes on to

establish that non-calling of the PW-14 either by the prosecution or by the

defence has not caused any prejudice to either party.

It was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel that, the prosecution has

called only two officers to prove the detection in order to avoid contradictions

and omissions being made if more witnesses were to be called. I am of the view

that, since the deciding of how many witnesses the prosecution needs to call in

Page 17 of 17

order to prove a case is up to the prosecution, the appellant cannot argue that

non-calling of more witnesses should be considered in favour of him until he can

show that it has led to a situation where a fair trial has not been afforded to him.

I do not find any such situation in this action. Therefore, I find no merit in the

considered ground of appeal either.

The 10th Ground of Appeal: -

It appears that the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel that a fair trial

has not been afforded to the appellant is based on his stand with regard to the

earlier considered grounds of appeal. I do not find any reason to accept that no

fair trial has been afforded to the appellant. After the conclusion of the evidence

led by the prosecution and the defence, the learned High Court Judge has well

considered the prosecution evidence and the dock statement made by the

appellant, and has analyzed the same with a clear understanding of the relevant

law applicable. He has given clear reasons for his findings, for which I have no

reason to disagree with. As he should have, he has considered the totality of the

evidence and has determined that the prosecution has proved the case beyond

reasonable doubt. Hence, I find no merit in the argument that a fair trial has not

been afforded to the appellant.

For the aforementioned reasons, the appeal of the appellant is hereby dismissed,

as I find no merit in the appeal, the conviction and the sentence affirmed.
